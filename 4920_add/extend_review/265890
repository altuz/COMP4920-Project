Basically, this game is six-sided Minesweeper, but with the guessing element completely removed. You never have to guess a single time in any of the puzzles, and you will always have enough information available to you to make the next move. It's a game of pure logic and deduction, and one that will truly test your skills in the later levels. My only complaint is that the game is pretty short, but there is also Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite to play.Highly recommended if you even remotely enjoyed Minesweeper."

The music and sound effects are spot-on fantastic, the puzzles are lovingly and painstakingly crafted, and the difficulty progression is just perfect from one puzzle to the next.The mechanics are similar to Minesweeper and if you find yourself clicking the wrong mouse button (like me), you can change the button configuration from the Input tab of the configuration menu when you first start the game.I have now bought this game twice at full price (I bought again when released on Steam) and I don't regret it in the slightest.

Common complaint is that it is short, but for the price I still see this as a good value title. There are around 30 logic puzzles, still offering several hours of challenges to exercise your mind. Concept is most like the classic Minesweeper that was included with Windows OS back in the day. You need to use logic to determine if there is a 'number' or 'vacant' hex in the adjacent cell from the already revealed hexes.The simple designs, grows in complexity as you progress through larger levels with new rules being added & for the purists there is also the challenge of completing each puzzle without any mistakes. Graphics are bright yet clean & basic, but suitable to the game. Sounds are relaxing & controls are easy (just left & right mouse buttons).Other than the exceptionalLYNE, this is one of the best puzzlers I have played in recent years & look forward to trying out the sequels (which I am told are a much harder challenge too!).If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"

,Recommended,265890,14547653,"Posted: 19 February, 2015",all,Tawny Lawns 💗,"I usually satisfy myself with mindless clicking at things that move, clubbing zombies and “flamethrowing” aliens enough to make a batter-happy Flintstone giddy. After a while the repetitive slashing and gouging puts a strain on my steadily numbing mind and I need a break. Brainiac games like Hexcells provides that pause from the world of action titles that many gamers find soothing from time to time. The minimalistic interface calms you to the core like entering your hotel room, the first day of your sunny beach-filled holiday. Easy-peasy controls and rules, as most strategic puzzle games tend to excel in, are explained through directions (though for Level 1 I felt the couple of trial plays planted in the beginning of each rule change, would have sufficed). I’ve seen plenty of reviews exclaiming it as comfortably easy to finish, which isn’t quite true as new rules are added regularly and consistently starting at Level 11. This lessens repertoire and makes Hexcells highly entertaining for a puzzle game of its kind. It calls for the elimination and deduction tools we have honed through countless hours of playing games such as Sudoku and Minesweeper. There is no timer so in a sense is closer to a Sudoku that’s pleasing to the eye. Hexcells adds the “chic” that Sudoku lacks and the logicality which Minesweeper is deficient in through functions which allow no room for the guessing games and visuality to match. No function is lacking or overdone in Hexcells. As Goldilocks would say, “It’s just right.” It is one of the most accessible and convenient game I have ever played. The UI looks fantastic for touch screens and as I’ve been marooned on my laptop for a few months, it’s always heaven to play low spec games that won’t freeze mid-play and still provide high quality content to keep me amused for consecutive hours. It is also a great game for a few minutes here and there as an easy to start, continue and leave at any time type game that doesn’t bore. For example, the widely loved classic, Peggle will have me dozing off in a few minutes flat although it’s a sweet little thing.The intermediate level starts around Lv. 18-19 and I started finding it mind boggling beginning at Lv. 22. After that point some are comparatively easier than others which didn’t reflect the actual order or the levels. Thank goodness because the couple of easier levels here and there let me hang on to my sanity!Most of the reviews I’ve read stated plenty of appreciation towards the needlessness of guessing the answers. There is 0% need to speculate and everything must be calculated if you want to play the game to its maximum. Keep in mind that if you mess up once you’ll end up with the obvious answer which means it’s extremely easy to use trial and error to pick through the games effortlessly. This sucks all the fun out of it so I suggest you aim for 100% accuracy each time you play or try and forget the hex you just wrongly clicked and move on to something else so you won’t end up getting everything easy. Another tip I have is to try playing it as fast as your mind will think and fingers will click because the music sounds better that way. It has one of those almost interactive tracks so that what and how you click will determine a different sound that in turns melds into the original score underneath it.In all honestly, the aspect the feature I enjoyed the least was the music in Hexcells as it is repetitive and some parts sound like an orchestra of mobile phones with annoying, monotonous ringtones. (Note: I understand that there was only so much the developer could do and it wasn't that bad, I'm just used to better soundtracks is all. ;D) Which is why I eventually turned down the volume and even then I still couldn’t quite stand it. It wasn’t the relaxed ambience I was hoping for but it wasn’t as noticeable when playing at a faster pace (clicking hexes in acceleration) for reasons already noted above. A better example would be Duet, the strategic arcade game by Kumobius (iOS/Android). The music is directed via the player’s fingertips as they go through the puzzles and it is scored in a way that’s surprisingly meditative for a game of somewhat high difficulty. The fluidity of a game’s soundtrack influences a massive portion of its play mood in any genre. Other than that, I’m interested in buying the other two as well for a rainy day and hope the background music is a tad better than the first one."

I got stuck a few times but it felt like a revalation solving the puzzles!The theme is modern and gentle, perfectly suited for a puzzle game like this. Music and sound helps setting a calm mood.It's really cheap, but has decent length for its price. I paid less than €1 for it and had about 6 hours of fun with this game!ConsYou can only turn sound on/off altogether, but I would've loved to turn the music a bit lower but keep the sound at normal volumeMaking mistakes can cost you points that you need to get the perfect highscores, which can be quite bothersome if you have nearly finished the map and mixed up left and right mouse button. I would've liked a hotkey such as R to restart the map quickly or something like that.Personally I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap but great brain teasing game. I've already purchasedHexcells Plus(extra puzzles) andHexcells Infinite(even more puzzles, and a random puzzle generator!) as well and I look forward to playing those.

,Recommended,265890,29551432,Posted: 28 January,all,_BillCipher | ScrapTF,"In Short -A couple weeks ago I had a couple £ in my Steam wallet and was not sure what to buy. A friend pointed me to a small puzzle game calledHexcells. I was sceptical, but after buying & downloading it, I am glad I took the plunge. Not dissimilar to the old Windows game Minesweeper, Hexcells is a little Indie game created by a man by the name of Matthew Brown. There are two other Hexcells games, Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite.In Depth -It is not easy to explain Hexcells' concept in a review; you mainly learn as you go on. Through the later levels, you are taught extra rules and slowly the puzzles increase in difficulty. If you enjoy logical puzzles, you'll have a blast with Hexcells. No aspect of this game requires luck or guessing, every puzzle can be solved using your mind. Too easy for you? Keep going, the later puzzles are not only giant but also pretty darn hard. Of course, multiple people have created guides showing what to do in each if you want to cheat your way through, but that takes the fun out of it! In all, Hexcells is a calming puzzle experience that is perfect when you just want to chill out.PROs and CONs -PROs -A simple concept that gets expanded and twisted in later levels.The soundtrack is ambient and calming.Enough levels to give you a decent amount of game time for the money spent.CONs -A few times in which the gameplay gets repetitive. There is a little too much time between new mechanics being shown.Very little instruction when the game starts. I had literally no clue what I was doing at first. It took me a while...Not very simple to pick up and play. You have to relearn all the symbols the game teaches you once. Something that could be fixed with an 'instructions' section of the menu or even titlescreen.FinallyThere are tons of Indie puzzle games on Steam. Some succeed. Some fail. Some are absolutely horrible. Some are actually great. And Hexcells absolutely nails it. I love nearly everything about Hexcells. Thank you, Matthew Brown for making such a chill puzzle game that really hits the spot when I'm bored.Enjoy this review?

,Recommended,265890,17230440,"Posted: 25 July, 2015",all,Weasel,"I'm something of a Picross nut, having played and near-beaten most of Nintendo's Picross games. When I saw Hexcells on the Steam New Releases section, I was quite happy; I have always thought these kinds of logic puzzles were better on a platform with a mouse. A few bucks later (thanks to Steam trading card sales - this game doesn't give out cards, btw), I had Hexcells in my library.The actual logic of Hexcells is not difficult to grasp. If you've played Minesweeper or Picross 3D, you'll be right at home. You'll be following numbers inside of hexes, with symbols indicating whether the surrounding blue hexes will be consecutive or split, and later you will find numbers on rows or columns as well, with similar symbols. These symbols are, admittedly, not as easy to remember as I'd like (a problem that even Picross 3D had). I've made a few mistakes in puzzles because I misread the symbol in a given hex. In a related note, it's also somewhat easy to forget which mouse button performs which function, causing stupid mistakes that get recorded in your level score. Hexcells does not have a time limit of any kind, so you are essentially free to brute-force your way through a puzzle if you so desire, but making mistakes reduces how many hexes you receive as a reward for that level, and Steam Achievement nuts will probably want to avoid doing that if possible, as there is an achievement awarded for getting a perfect score on every level.Presentationally speaking, Hexcells is simple and pleasing. The visuals are extremely minimalist (hexagons, and only hexagons); the only visual effects you'll be seeing are the tiny animations for shading or breaking hexes. The music is electronic ambience, in the style of Solar Fields (i.e. Mirror's Edge or Capsized), with the added effect that in-game sound effects are played on rhythm, a la Lumines or Rez. If I could complain about the presentation in any area, though, Hexcells does not provide a color-blind option (though I am not color-blind, I am unsure if the game's use of blue and orange would cause problems for those who are), and the low-contrast nature of the backgrounds makes the ""Menu"" button difficult to find.I am pleased to report that Hexcells performs admirably on both Windows and Linux, owing to its nature as a Unity game. I would presume that Macintosh support is also good, as a result. Both of my test machines (no slouches, admittedly) ran the game with no obvious slowdowns or graphical glitches. I'd wager most machines made in the last half-decade will work just fine; I suppose netbooks may be feasible as well, but as I do not have access to one right now, I cannot say for certain, so Your Mileage May Vary.About the biggest complaint I have about Hexcells, though, is that there are just not enough puzzles. Hexcells offers 6 ""worlds,"" with five puzzles each, and the last puzzle essentially acting as a credits reel. I finished the game in a little over an hour, though I have not achieved Perfect on every puzzle just yet.All that said, though, at $3 or less, Hexcells is certainly not a waste of your money. I'd like to see more logic-puzzle games like this on Steam."
76561198024972696,Recommended,265890,33018388,Posted: 29 June,all,DALCOhstangultion,"""Hexcells"" is a very well done, fun little game.  As everyone has said, it's like Minesweeper with hexes instead of squares.  The learning curve is perfectly done, and even I (who maybe played a handful of Minesweeper games several decades ago) completed it without problem.  I've got only a few quibbles:- The game is short.  Its 30 puzzles took me 4.1 hours to complete, and I'm SLOW at this.  Still, I paid less than a dollar for it during the Steam Summer Sale, so it was worth it.  Heck, even by my el-cheapo ""dollar an hour"" metric for games, it's worth it at its current list price of about three dollars.  Still, It would be nice if it were longer.- Even though the game is playable under Steam's Family Sharing capability, it doesn't handle its Achievements well in that.  Anyone who shares your game gets all the Achievements you got when you played it.- The main menu in the game has 3 ""slots.""  Initially, I thought they were for different clumps of puzzles.  Instead, it turns out those are just a poor man's set of profiles.  The puzzles inside the slots are identical to each other.- The white space between hexes in the puzzles isn't really explained well.  It turns out that when counting neighbors of hexes, the white space is important:  the stuff across it doesn't count.  But, when looking for contigous or non-contiguose hexes in rows or diagonals, the white space gets ignored.All of the above are just minor nits.  So, I'm happy to recommend the game."

Your goal is to determine which of the hexagonal cells on each grid should be marked blue, and which should be eliminated from the game, using the various clues given to you for each puzzle.Unlike that classic, however, there is always a way to logically determine how to solve the puzzles inHexcellswithout making a mistake.  This sets it apart from games which use trial and error as a mechanic; while there is nothing wrong with trial and error, it's nice to see game that is designed thoughtfully enough to allow each level to be solved the first time without making a mistake for the observant.Hexcellsfalls into that category of games which are easy to pick up and play, but difficult to master.  Controlling the game could not be simpler; you need only use the mouse to confirm or erase cells and to navigate menus.  The overall design aesthetic is pleasing both visually and aurally, with nice ambient music accompanying each section of the game.  The music can easily be muted if you prefer, however.  There is also no pressure; you can take as long as you need to solve a particular puzzle, and it's easy to back out if you need to take a break.  All puzzles can be retried, and you can preview later stages as you unlock them through successful completion of the early stages.  The only possible criticism, as I have seen pointed out in reviews on-line, is that you can't determine which puzzles still need to be perfected once you've cleared many of them, unless you write them down or something.  Once a stage is cleared, its symbol in the puzzle index is marked blue, without any discerning marks to distinguish those you have perfected from those in which you made a mistake.Hexcellsis not a short game, but it's primary downfall is that once you've played through a few times, the replay value goes down.  It's almost like thePortalseries; once you have that initial moment of wonder and discovery as you solve each level, it wears off.  You can't have those moments of discovery ever again as you have basically figured out everything there is to learn after so long.But that doesn't mean you shouldn't give this game a try, and the price is right.  The puzzle design is very thoughtful; it's clear a lot of work went into each one to make sure that players can perfect them all.  This is the type of design that appeals to me.  Even if I make a mistake, I know I can come back later and re-examine the puzzle for the correct solution.

You had to find the mines and avoid them by marking them. It worked with some clues, since numbers gave away how many mines are close by.The Hexcells games are very similar to it, but they are not working in square blocks, they come in hexagon shape and often remind of chemical combinations when you open the next level. These shapes make it sometimes hard to figure out what is going on and in later levels you get extra clues for the lines of hexagons and stuff like that.playing Hexcells is fun in a kind of weird way. Even if you don't want to make your math homework, you sit down to ""calculate"" the grids, but it is not that much math anyway, more like drawing lines from dot to dot.Later versions of Hexcells (Hexcells Plus & Hexcells Ininite) are basically the same thing on harder levels and Infinite includes an Endless-Mode that let's you play levels created by chance.

I'm exhausted.Hexcells is a logic puzzle that's similar to other number games like Minesweeper and Picross, as you use processes of elimination and deduction to fill in patterns of tiles.  The distinction here is that since the tiles are hexagons, they're not restricted by square grids, and most puzzles look like abstract shapes or very loosely defined objects.  Black-background hexes have numbers on them from 0-6, indicating how many of the gold tiles around them can be clicked to turn blue, which counts toward stage completion.Those hexes are a mixed blessing--finding all of them is the whole point of the game (though you do have to mark every single tile, whether you believe it to be a blue ""hit"" or a black ""guide""), but unless you know how many blue tiles are in a given area, these don't often give any information on the tiles around them.  The numbers themselves eventually adopt additional characteristics that give you more information on how to complete a stage, but it's well worth remembering that making a decision about one tile necessarily is effectively making a decision about all of the tiles next to it as well.  Levels are divided up into groups and sometimes able to be completed out of order, and completing each level perfectly will often mean you unlock the next set even without fully having to finish the previous one.The game is easy to learn, with simple controls and all of the rules explained as you need them, and there are no hectic time limits to worry about.  (I don't know if there's a way to save during levels.)  You'll probably build up enough stress just by trying to finish levels without making mistakes, as difficulty ramps up quickly and there's no quick way to restart stages, that I know of, without exiting back out to the level-select menu.  This may serve the purpose of discouraging cheating, though.  It would be nice to be able to turn the music on and off during a level, but the little 'bloop' sounds the tiles make when clicked go really well with the gentle soundtrack, so much so that you might not notice them at first.You can make guesses about what tiles are where, but it's much more satisfying to finish a stage or even a small section of one because you understood the rules than because you happened to get lucky.  The game doesn't need reflexes, but it expects and encourages patience and discipline (try not to scream if you misclick toward the end of a level you've been chipping away at for half an hour), all for the cost of a small meal."

This game is easy and very short. Completed to 100% in less than 5 hours while tired and not thinking as fast as I would while fully awake. I think most will find the price is a bit high for the amount of content.Many say that the game mechanics are similar to minesweeper crossed with Picross (nonogram puzzles) on a hex grid. I would say instead of standard picross mechanics it is closer to the mechanics used in Picross 3D which are actually somewhat different than standard nonogram puzzles.At the end of each level, you are awarded with a certain amount of progress hexes which are used to unlock more levels. The amount of progress hexes earned depend on the difficulty of the level and the amount of mistakes you have made during the level. There is no way of knowing how many progress hexes there are for a specific level or, if you missed any in prior runs, how many are still left to earn. This is only indicated at the end of a level and can not be checked on again without completing the level once more.Note that Hexcells Plus has a much higher difficulty than this game and not just more puzzles at a similar difficulty. If you found this game too easy or think you may be ready to try to take on more challenging levels, go try that. Don't be fooled by how easy the first few levels are on Hexcells Plus. By level 12 you've already exceeded the difficulty of this game.

The game is nice to look at, and as you will stare intently at your screen to find the solution, this is not to be dismissed.+ Ambient sounds are perfect.+ Interesting and evolving gameplay.+? Easy achievements.Cons:- May lack challenge.- Very short (I perfected the game in less than two hours so I could have got a refund).- Little replay value.- Some rules are unclear (adjacency in discontinuous rows and columns especially).- The rules are only explained in the level where they appear for the first time. A reminder of all rules would have been helpful.Verdict: Highly recommended. Cheap and smooth, nice and relaxing, fun and a little challenging, this makes a perfect addition in your puzzle games library. Two sequels, increasingly more challenging, are available on Steam.Comments and developments:In this game you must find the 'bombs' hidden on some pattern made of adjacent hexagons. Just as in Minesweeper, hexagons tell you how many bombs are to be found in the neighboring cells. As the game goes on, new mechanics are added: how many bombs there are in row and columns, whether the bomb are adjacent are not. Only by combining all the clues can the bombs be all found.It must be stressed that the levels are not random. Hence, they have been carefully crafted and there is a logical way to go through. Unlike Minesweeper, you will never start by randomly clicking and if you are stuck, it's only because you missed a clue or did not figure out how to combine them adequately. All levels can be achieved with no mistake.Also, a very good thing: the first mistake doesn't count and you can still get a perfect score. However, if you commit a second one, the first mistake will also be counted as such. As clicking errors happen, this little safeguard is a real blessing."
,Recommended,265890,27476755,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,SirMarth01,"Hexcells is essentially an overall enhancement of Minesweeper. Where Minesweeper has mines, you have blue hexagons. Where Minesweeper has randomly generated puzzles that sometimes force you to guess, Hexcells has predesigned puzzles that always give you enough information to solve it without ever needing to guess. (Although sometimes it may feel otherwise.)Why go for Hexcells over Minesweeper when there's a limited set of puzzles? Hexcells' puzzles areincrediblywell designed, starting simple and adding new mechanics as you move along. Beyond just telling you how many hexes nearby are blue, you get information on if they're all connected or not. Vertical or diagonal columns get similar treatment. Sometimes blue hexes have numbers in them, telling you how many blue hexes are in the surrounding area.Eventually, you have to combine these hints in creative ways to determine where the blue hexes are—or where they aren't. When you're finally able to combine them all to work your way to completion, it provides a level of satisfaction that Minesweeper just can't compete with.The only real downside to Hexcells is that it's pretty short—an acceptable downside, considering the price. Thankfully, Hexcells Plus (more puzzles) and Hexcells Infinite (more puzzles, a random puzzle generator,andplayer-created levels) are available, and getting the complete pack is incredibly affordable (and highly recommended), especially on sale."

However, you can pick it up as part of the Hexcells package with the two sequels for cheap, which gives you plenty of game play.- Left-click/right-click can sometimes mix you up, so you click the wrong button.

,Recommended,265890,33842721,Posted: 27 July,all,100% Hippo,"Hexcells is a terrific, relaxing puzzle game. It takes place on a hex-based grid, and the point of each level is to figure out which cells to mark and which to not, similar to the premise of Minesweeper, but in the best possible way. There are several different mechanics introduced throughout the game, and each is introduced well and used in interesting ways in the following levels. There are 30 total levels, and some are short, mainly for the purpose of introducing a concept, but some, particularly the later levels, can take quite a while. I don't remember how long it took me the first time, but I've played through a few times to get to my current playtime.It is nice that there is a unique solution to each level, and guessing is never required. You can always progress purely through logic, it just may take a bit to see how. There's no time constraint involved at all, so there's no reason not to take your time and work carefully through the levels. I found that almost all the mistakes I made were when I went too fast and hit the wrong button. The soundtrack is ambient and very relaxing, and the game does a good job of making the sound effects for actions in the game go with the music too.The achievements come from progressing through the game, and from perfecting every level. The game's definition of 'perfecting' a level is nice and generous, and you can make a single mistake and it still counts, which comes in handy in some of the larger levels where at least one mistake is fairly inevitable. The achievements aren't too hard to get, though you may need to retry a level of two to minimize your mistakes.Overall this is a wonderful, relaxing, puzzle game, and while it is somewhat on the short side, if you like it you should definitely get the other two, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They're all wonderful, and Infinite even comes with a level generator."

Although it is much gentler, rather than game-ending bombs the player is identifying certain hexes. If a mistake is made then it is just recorded and the game continues. There is no timer or time limit, nor any way of scoring other than the number of mistakes made. The puzzles are hand-designed (no randomness) and provide a couple of hours of thought to perfect with mix of basic logic and memory (as the puzzles do not change if restarted). It is a nicely polished game with clean graphical style and nicely responsive music. It has no replayability, but it is cheap and well made. Definitely worth picking up in a sale or bundle, as I will be doing with its sequels.https://youtu.be/RfK164YvJh8"

It sets the foundation for the remainder of the trilogy.The way I'd describe Hexcells is that it's a brainy love child of Minesweeper and Sudoku.  The puzzles are all solvable, despite how frustrated you might originally get when attempting them.  There is a nice endorphin rush when you realize you've figured out which cell to click on next because you made a second-level deduction that isn't immediately obvious.  However, the first time you play you'll probably just accept that you made a mistake and keep going.  When you're done, you'll want to do it all over again, but trying for the ""Perfectionist"" achievement (no mistakes).  Even if you do make a mistake, you can simply start the level over again to try it mistake-free.Hexcells probably has about 2-3 hours of game play in it, but you might come back to try again for that achievement...I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys logic puzzles or spatial puzzles.

There are more rules, meaning that there is potential for much harder puzzles than minesweeper can offer, but since there are no randomly generated levels, the amount of time you'll spend on this game is minimal. Said potential is not reached, so the game is never really challenging, which does nothing to increase the length. (I had no problems completing all the puzzles in around 1.6 hours, so you could easily play through it in one sitting.) Still, there is one huge advantage: guessing is never required. Guessing is the one thing I really hate in minesweeper - of which I am a big fan, regardless - and to play a similar game without it simply feels wonderful.I find that the sounds fit the game nicely; they feel calm and soothing and play short melodies as you click the tiles. This, along with the focus on number of errors rather than time spent (I'm looking at you, minesweeper clock), makes the game feel very relaxing, despite it being a puzzler.Pros:+ No guessing+ Nice, relaxing soundsCons:- Too short- Too easy- No randomly generated levelsIf you like minesweeper (and/or similar games) this game is definitely worth the purchase. If not, I'd recommend you to try it anyway, since the game is quite cheap. For those who fancy something more difficult (and thus longer), Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite increase the difficulty by several notches, fixing the first two cons mentioned above. (As you might also guess, the last one also has randomly generated levels, although they are significantly easier than the rest of the game.) In that case, this one might serve as a short introduction to the concept."

The blame is totally on you for any mistakes you may make. They give you all the tools to figure out each puzzle if you can figure out the logic. The learning curve for figuring out that logic is spot on. Ideally play through the series straight, as the second and third game do start with more complicated puzzles and slightly new variations sooner. The feel as you go through a puzzle is likewise great. Occasionally you may get stuck for a solid length of time. The payoff is well worth it though. When you figure out a new bit, you get a solid rush as you suddenly can tick through another dozen cells with the new information provided.Only two small complaints for the whole series. There is no separate toggle for the music and sound effects. Fortunately the music track is quiet enough that you can play something else over it and mostly not notice it. The music is nice and mellow if you want that, but not really the most engaging when you are stuck at the same spot for a long while. I went with the Classical Complete Works station from Pandora and it suited the mood quite well.Second, the puzzles towards the end get quite long and there is no means to save mid puzzle that I could find. I assume this was so that you couldn't cheese your way to perfection. I would prefer the game at least give you the option to save in the middle if you were quitting and have the save auto-delete when you continue to prevent that.

The basic mechanics are pretty much the same, the difference being that squares are now hexagons. It's also a lot more forgiving, although you'll likely find yourself restarting games just because you want to complete each level without any mistakes. Besides, all levels are solvable without guessing, and  completing a difficult level will often fill you with satisfaction. The atmosphere is quite enjoyable, although I found myself switching off the sound because it could be slightly distracting.However, there is some criticism to be made. Once you get the grip of the game mechanics, which should happen quite soon, the game becomes rather limited. The most challenging levels become a time for staring at the screen, wondering ""what am I missing?"". You'll often get stuck and resort to carefully scanning the screen, trying to find out which is the next tile you can click on. And that is why I'd game this game a mixed review if I could - it can become a test of patience rather than one of cleverness. Although fans of Minesweeper will not probably be bothered much. ;)The game is also quite short, considering that I beat all levels with a perfect score in just two hours.

Every puzzle (30 to complete) in it is fully solvable using logic, no guessing is required. It gradually introduces you to different clues as it increases in difficulty as you progress through the levels.It is forgiving there is not punishment to making mistakes or guessing other than being unable to “perfect” the level which is completing it with a limited amount of mistakes, which is also the only real reason to reply levels.One negative is that puzzles can’t be saved mid game, so you lose progress when you exit.Even though it can be quite quick to get through the 30 available puzzles I still recommend Hexcells as; one on sale it is very cheap, and two it’s a good starting point to ease you into the series.I had no technical issues with Hexcells."

If you are one of those cool people who pass their idle time on their PC by playing the classic minesweeper game, Hexcells takes that to a whole new level.Things I like about the game:+ I bought all the three games (not costly at all) and it is absolutely fun.+ The levels are totally solvable by logic and you wont face a guessing situation like you would in classic minesweeper game. This requires a lot more logical reasoning than minesweeper and I really loved it.+ This game has its own ambient music (which some of you may like).+ The display is clean and the game gives proper introduction on every new rule as they appear.+ The game runs equally smoothly on Linux, Windows and Mac. So I am able to play on different machines at work, or home.+ Very small installation size, Downloads the game in a new machine instantly.+ This game even has steam achievements.Things I did not like about the game:- No profile synchronization among devices. Everytime you install this in a new machine, you have to start from the beginning.- Music could be a bit more mild, I did not like short length repeatative music, had it turned off within first few levels.- Levels do not change, you can make mistakes and repeat the level with 0 mistake. Although if you challenge yourself honestly, this is not much of a problem (In the Infinity version, there are random levels though).- I am not sure about the scoring system. How making mistake affects your score and if there is any relation with time etc.- Short gameplay duration (this wont take you very long to complete, but I personally wont mind replaying).So far, I like the game and would recommend to anyone who is into these type of tiny games."

Then some numbers are marked to let you know if the blue cells have to be all continuous or have at least one space in them.It's a fun game, but very short.  The puzzles increase in difficulty at a decent rate, never getting either boring or too frustrating.  But I was left wanting more puzzles.  (Fortunately, there are two other games.)  The music is terrific, and surprisingly relaxing.  Sometimes the chimes when marking a hex got on my nerves, but most of the time they were enjoyable.Overall, it's a great little game, but the length means it's not worth the full price, in my opinion.  I tend to require about 2 hours worth of enjoyable playtime per dollar spent to feel like I got my money's worth, and if I'd bought this at full price, it wouldn't have reached that.  If you can get it for 40-50% off, however, I think it's definitely worth picking up, or if you have less harsh criteria for money spent (or do puzzles a bit slower).  I haven't yet played the sequels, though I picked those up, too - I understand the third one has a puzzle generator with thousands of possible boards, which would take care of the shortness issue.One other minor critique - one of the achievements is to finish every level with a perfect score, but I could find no indication in the level menu of which levels had finished with a mistake.  (I may have been missing it, of course.)  If you don't care about Steam achievements, it's no issue, but if you do, I suggest immediately replaying a level if you make a mistake.Since I've seen a lot of reviewers do personal scales, and it's helped me a lot to decide what to buy, I put my own here.I give Hexcells a 4 out of 5. Additionally, I usually only give a thumbs up if I got at least two hours of enjoyment out of it for every dollar I spent, and this game did that. (It wouldn't have if I hadn't bought it on discount, however.)5: Amazing game, easily worth the full price.4: Good game, solid addition to the genre, might want to wait for a discount.3: Pretty entertaining game, but some issues. Buy at a discount unless you love the genre.2: More cons than pros, a lot of issues. Only buy with a strong discount, and only if the game truly sounds like something you'd enjoy.1: Don't get this game unless it's free. Even then, consider spending your time playing something decent."

Gives a minesweeper kind of feel, which adds in more puzzle enhancements as you progress through the levels. Starts off very basic so that you get a feel for the game, and then you look up and all you want to do is perfect all the levels. So the games goes, there are a few blocks with numbers on the board and you have to puzzle out whether the block is another number or a blue block. The block has 6 sides (obviously) and the number says how many blue block are touching it. As the game progresses, it adds {} around a number to say the blue blocks are sequential, or -- around a number to say they are split. It then goes father to say that there are so may in this line by putting the number on the outside of that row or column. The easy feature which helps a lot for bigger puzzles is that you can click on the outside number and it draws a line through that row or column to see which ones.All in all lots of fun and challenging at the same time.

You click on a hexagon and it'll reveal a number and that number is how many 'mines' are around that specific hexagon, sound familiar? What Hexcells adds onto the original Minesweeper experience is a more puzzle oriented design to its levels, with each progressively testing your knowledge of new mechanics that get introduced throughout the worlds. That beind said each level in a world has a set amount of 'mines' in predefined locations, some puzzles might take you multiple tries to first realise the pattern but once you do it's abundantly satisfying when you finally solve it.This game has a very minimalistic approach to both its audio and graphics; there isn't much to complain about because it gets the job done. Simple hexagon shapes with an electronic ambience in the style of Solar Fields, with the added bonus of the game's audio playing in rhythm to your actions.Honestly my biggest complaint with this game is that there aren't enough puzzles, if you're like me than it'll leave you with that feeling of ""I want more!"".

The advantage to actual minesweeper is that the levels are pre-designed to make sure its NEVER a 50/50 chance and always logical. Pre-designed levels also means its really really short though, I played multiple levels twice and still it says 1.7 hours for me. There is also no need to play twice, no achievements not granted or mines exploding when you make a mistake, the mistake counter just goes up. which bothered be enough to perfionist myself to 100% completion. This btw also has the nice side effect of adding another perfectly completed game to your profile, since getting all the achievement is really really easy.The mechanics are introduced one after another. This means there is no overload with rules, this also means that the game only really gets hard towards the end once ALL comes together.All together a nice albeit short puzzle game that I can recomend to anyone who is a fan of minesweeper and kakuro and to those who just like puzlle games, particularly when on sale.EDIT: I mentioned Kakuro quite often, perhaps I should clarifiy that no you dont add numbers to get the crossum in the end.

You do this by looking at the clues already given to you in the form of numbers and arrangements. For example, if you have a hex that has a number 2 inside it, that means 2 of the neighboring hexes will be blank blue ones and the rest will be other numbered ones. As you go through the different combinations and solve more of the puzzle, more clues and patterns will become apparent to you, until you're able to fill up everything.The strategy is simple and intuitive, with easy to understand instructions whenever a new rule is added, so you never feel like you don't know what you're doing. It's very satisfying when you solve a super complicated puzzle and see how it all fits together like an equation. There were a couple of times when I felt like I wasn't given as many clues as was necessary and just had to guess, which is annoying, but these times were few and might have been simply my own incompetence.The graphic scheme is obviously very bare-bones but it's very visually eye-catching, in my opinion, which is nice. There are only a couple of music tracks but they're very serene and help get you into the mood while you're puzzle solving.Overall I think Hexcells is a pretty good game, challenging but not frustrating, and one that will give you a good 3-6 hours of play-time, and for that price it's definitely worth it. If you're a puzzle fan, I urge you to check it out."

Hexcells is a bit like a modern Minesweeper with hexagons, that also mixes a bit of Nonograms (Picross) in, has no randomly generated levels, but only static ones, and also adds some new stuff. It's very relaxing (probably mostly because of the music) and quite challenging. Unfortunately, I didn't need that much time to play through all the levels. Fortunately it already has sequels I've also bought.

And i think that's the real strength of the game - the individual elements of the game may not be unique, but the combination of them makes it truly unique.I recommend the game on the basis of its originality, and also i find the puzzles very enjoyable to solve.The game has 30 puzzles, some are shorter than others, but none is really long. When i completed the game Steam claims i spent 5 hours, but a lot of this time i was alt-tabbed, so in reality took me like 2 hours to beat the puzzles. For some, the short duration might be a problem, it was not for me. If you look for more puzzles, you can also buy Hexcells Plus (more puzzles) and Infinite (more puzzles, and the possibility of generating an infinite amount of them.I read some negative reviews claiming that the game is also too easy, and i can't really argue with that.

The difference are that few levels of Hexcell aren't randomly generated and more complex mechanics are introduced as you go on.The first problem I have with this game is that it does not let you fail. Rather than failing a level for hitting a 'mine', it only count your mistake. It sound like a good thing, but it simply inadvertently spoils the game. I admit that I don't know what could be done to fix this, but nevertheless its the equivalent to trying to solve a math problem with the answer in front of you. You might do your best not to look, you still end up figuring something that you wouldn't have normally.The second problem is related to the few inconsistencies of the game. It's a minor issue, but sometimes, it seems that the game take liberties with its own rules (or simply doesn't set them). For example;Two mines in a row of four tiles are said to be next to each other? Turn out that 'next to each other' still count when the row is separated by a huge white space.symbols like '--' indicate that mines aren't next to each other? It only mean that at least one mine is not connected to the others.etc.Like a said, this is a minor issue, but combined with a very short unpunishing game, it doesn't leave you anything worthwhile. I can't recommend this game when other interesting puzzle games are available for the same price."

I was really taken aback when I discovered the ""1"", ""2"", ""3"" entries in the menu didn't bring me to different puzzles but were just save slots. I couldn't believe it was that short. The puzzles may be handcrafted, ensuring that there never is need for guessing, but they aren't all that elegant for it. Not only are the puzzles easy, but they also contain way too many redundant clues.Another minor problem is that, by default, the mouse buttons used to open a cell or indicate it's part of the pattern are reversed from Minesweeper, which caused a couple of mistakes from my part.Now, I've already begun playing the sequel, Hexcells Plus and the puzzles there aere much more challenging, which is a good thing.Anyone with a certain level of puzzle exprience should probably skip this one and go straight to Hexcells Plus."

I got the bundle on sale so it cost less than a candy bar, which is a good price for the 4 hours of fun I got out of it.However there are a couple gameplay aspects that I don’t like, and one game braking issue that has ruined the Hexcells for me, thus I can’t recommend it.I am going to compare Hexcells to Minesweeper in this review, I understand that it is not suppose to be the same game, but they are the only two games in this genre that I have experience with.First, lets look at the parts I like.Pros:The music is peaceful, and the sound effects fit in nicely.The game looks clean and modern.Unlike minesweeper, it is not stressful to click on tiles. (Though, this does have the effect of making it a little less satisfying when you complete the puzzle correctly.)I like the extra tile options {3} for three connected tiles, -2- for two disconnected tiles, and the numbers on the outside of the grid for tiles in that row or column.I like the fact that there is no timer, so I don’t feel rushed. (I hate puzzle games that make you rush)I also like that the levels are not too hard to unlock.Unfortunately that is as far as the pros go for me.Cons:Unlike minesweeper, it counts a mistake if you flag a number tile! This is frustrating, especially when there is no “think about it” flag.  It may help if tiles that have their conditions met grey out, even if I have to do this manually, it would help I think.There is not a “replay” button on screen.  This only became a problem when I started really trying to get perfect scores, which was pretty quickly.I could not swap the mouse buttons.  I don’t know why, but I couldn’t get the mouse buttons to register as “keys.” By default the flag and destroy buttons are opposite Minesweeper, which really really messed up my clicking!  And, because flagging counted as a mistake I couldn’t even have one safe button!  In the end, I had to use keyboard keys and even though it’s not so bad, the entire thing was really frustrating.And here is the game braking issue!There is a really really easy way to cheat!It is so easy that once you know it is there, you can’t help but use it to your advantage, even if only accidentally!Please, if you enjoy this puzzle game, and don’t know about this yet, don’t read below.YOU CAN SEE BEHIND YELLOW TILES!!!  As you mouse over yellow covered tiles they wiggle a little, and the yellow is just that, a cover, the tile is already there!  If the cover moves far enough you can see the tile color behind it, whether it is blue or black! Even if you don’t actively try to peek, just moving the mouse around like normal will give you glimpses.  This completely broke the game for me because what is the point of spending time working out hard tiles when I can just mouse over them a bunch to see if my guess is right!!!"

Of course, if you guess wrong you have to start over if you want a perfect score. I guess this extends the playtime of the game because you have to do the levels over again until you can do it by memorization.

But new mechanics are introduced which pushes it toward the realm of Sudoku.  I never found it frustrating or confounding, because the rules are simple enough that you only have to look for the next step, not make crazy leaps of logic.  Also, while you don't get a full score for making several mistakes, each mistake you make at the same time serves as a hint and moves you closer to the solution (a nice parallel with positivity in real life!)So the gameplay requires you to be active and logical mentally, but not so much that you can't relax or have to get stressed.  And the rest of the game with its simple visuals and procedural ambient soundtrack works to make one of the most relaxing experiences I've seen in games.  The puzzles and music are in a nice area between idleness and frustrating which lets you slip easily into a meditative state while playing.I highly recommend this game, especially if you turn off the TV, turn the lights down a bit, kick up your feet, turn on a humidifier, lay a damp washcloth on your forehead, and just completely relax while playing.

YES!Hexcells is a puzzle game that's sort of like Minesweeper, but with more unique twists (many more rulings to make it a bit more complex). It's a frustrating game in the sense that you feel that you should be able to solve it, and making mistakes disappoints you more than you'd think (especially if you're after the Achievements - but even then, it keeps count how many mistakes you've made so far and displays it for the whole level, which stings). At some point, you'll likely get frustrated when you dont know what move to make - but you know that (and I can confirm that) there is always a 'legal' or 'smart' move (meaning it's assured correct; no need to have to guess to proceed).For those after the Achievements, this is a (relatively) quick game to go for - four hours and a bit for me to complete, counting restarts when mistakes are made (but I'm a puzzle afficionado so I might have ate through it a bit faster than average) and a noteworthy detail is that you dont feel like you're achievement hunting (as in doing obscure actions for the achievement) so much as just playing the game to its full.At this price? It's an easy buy - but getting it on sale, more especially on the complete pack?The game is more than worth the price!As an aside, even if the levels are the same, there is replayability in that the field is just so expansive and keeping track of all the minute details is near impossible.Get this game!

Yes, there are some additions. Yes, the levels have ""shapes"". But it's basically ""minesweeper"".It's not too hard - took me just over an hour to finish. It's kind of fun for those who like this sort of thing.However, it's not polished enough:- The controls are confusing (right-click ""opens"" the cell, left click sets the ""mine"" - the opposite of minesweeper) so that most of the mistakes I made were from mixing up the buttons- whenever you move the mouse over a hex, it ""reacts"" similar to a wrong click. That is very confusing when you play ""fast"", as you get the ""you did wrong"" feedback all the time making you hesitate- The ""extra"" information (""the mines are all adjacent"" for example) are often unnecessary (meaning you could have solved the puzzle even without it)- - best example for this is the appearance of {5} in a cell - meaning ""five neighbors have mines, all adjacent to each other"". This is silly, as it's the ONLY way to put five neighbor mines in a hex grid!- - but there are other examples of this information just serving nothing help at all. I would expect puzzles with this sort of ""extra information"" that doesn't always appear to be unsolvable without it.

The rules are simple, and the premise is a fresh take on the Minesweeper gameplay with another layer of complexity for those of us who like a bit more challenge in our logic puzzles.I was not disappointed. But, had I paid full price, I would have found the shortness of the game (I completed it with perfection in 70 minutes) and the static nature of the puzzles to be offputting.Ultimately, I can't recommend this game at full price unless you are a major fan of the genre, but at the sale price, it's a buck well spent. Hopefully the upcoming Hexcells Infinite will offer a more extended play opportunity.Pros - Clear in-game instructions. Excellent concept and implementation. Pleasant ambiant music.Cons - A finite number of puzzles. No 'free play' mode or randomized puzzles, so no replay value. A bit on the short side."

The game consists of 35 or so levels that gradually escalate in difficulty, while never requiring the player to outright guess. I repeat: Every puzzle can be logically deduced with the information available.

A super short game that doesn't take long to finish the game or even the achievements. It has a few flaws, but then again, what game isn't?Abstract -Hexcells is a short puzzle game involving numbers, hexagons, and a bit of thinking. It's short, sweet, not all that problematic, and fun for anyone looking for a little puzzle fix.What it is -Its a puzzle game, pretty straight forward. No huge plot or anything.Who you are -The puzzle solver!What you do in game -Solve the puzzles using the context clues and hints provided by clicking the different cells. Two counters appear at the top, the remaining blue cells that need to be revealed, and the mistake counter, which affects how many ""reward cells"" you get upon finishing a level. The higher your mistake count, the less you earn.Gameplay -The aim of the game is to find all the blue cells while making few to no mistakes as possible. Finding all the blue cells and revealing the hint cells will finish the level. You need a set amount of ""reward cells"" in order to open up the newer levels, increasing in amount the further you go along. The game itself is an enjoyable experience, and, for the most part, not all that difficult. It becomes a little painful at the end, but the biggest complaint is how often ""guesstimating"" is your only option. You can easily narrow down where the blue cells will be, but more often than not you'll end up guessing about where the blue cells could be. Some are smart guesses, others are just ""welp, I'm stumped!"" guesses. It kinda detracted from the idea of solving the puzzle using smarts.Messing up isn't the end of the world. You can simply come back to the level later to try for fewer mistakes. That said, one can simply get the solution by purposefully using the screenshot function, but that's more of a ""last resort"", so don't abuse it!Envionment -White background, orange hexagons. Kinda strains the eye after a while, so take breaks!Conclusion -Really, especially for the price, its a pretty smooth game. Guesstimations aside, its a game that keeps you thinking, doesn't punish you too hard for playing the game and making mistakes as you can always come back to play at your own pace. The game also has several parts so you can easily extend your play sessions with different puzzles. If you're a hardcore puzzle lover, give this a pass. Too easy, exploitable, relies too much on guessing. If you just enjoy a good puzzle to pass the time, pick it right up!"

It feels kind of like minesweeper, but with different ways of visualizing the pattern instead of just the number of ""mines"" surrounding a block.  Best of all, I have not had to guess once yet and I have beaten Hexcells, and am halfway through Hexcells Plus.  It does get challenging, but the solution can still be figured out using logic.  My wife even enjoys this game quite a bit, and she doesn't play games often.My main gripe with this game is that the controls feel backwards from minesweeper in that you left click the block that is part of the pattern (a mine), and right click an empty block.  I have played a good bit of minesweeper in the past and right click for mine and left click for empty was a very hard habit to break.  I had to restart many puzzles due to click confusion.  Unfortunately the game doesn't make you restart when you make a mistake, but it does keep track of the number of mistakes.  If you want to go for the perfectionist achievement, you have to beat every level without mistakes, and it doesn't seem to tell you which levels you made mistakes on if you choose to complete the stage with mistakes.  I get around this problem by restarting the level when I make a mistake.Overall, this is a great addition to the library!"

These are not different parts of the game! I didn't figure it out at first so I finished the game three times without knowing it... Nowhere is stated that the 3 ""slots"" are identical. Bad design!Other than that, well... This game is a lot similar to the absolute Microsoft classic, Minesweeper. Only cooler (and combined with the Japanese game of Kakuro). Main difference is that you almost never have to guess anything (mayber never, but it seems I didn't get all the hints). Which means you solve the puzzles like a math problem, using only logic. it feels great, but it also makes the game really easy.The game is also super short (don't let my playtime fool you, I actually left it running for a whole afternoon while I was out running errands) and contains only 30 puzzles; out of these 30, about 4 are actually challenging — there is more tutorial levels in the game than actual puzzles.And one last thing, the music sounds nice at first but quickly becomes annoying, and you can't deactivate it while in game (again, bad design).Bottom line: I had fun for about 20-30 min and thought the idea behind Hexcells was great, but the game is too easy and way too short for me to recommend it. It would have been free, I would have said go and play it! But I don't think it's worth 2,99 €. It's just like... a draft.I was enticed by the concept though so I'm gonna try Hexcells Plus and see if it is better. See you there."

Players are presented with an orange grid comprised to hexagons and it is up to them to determine whether these cells belong to the blue pattern or not (black cells). The black cells not part of the pattern have a number in them to indicate how many blue cells are adjacent to them, thus providing a clue as to how to proceed.After completing a puzzle the player is awarded blue hexcells based on the amount of mistakes made; these in time accumulate to unlock one of five new areas - allowing you to complete more difficult puzzles. Some areas also introduce new clues and rules to help you, making the puzzles more complex over time.Although similar to Minesweeper as mentioned, there is a key difference: there is always a logical next step. You never have to take a gamble so if you feel stuck, take a step back and focus on another area.Why I recommend the gameHexcells is a very simple puzzle game in its visual design. The menu is simple and provides the players with the option of turning the ambient music on or off and selecting one of three save slots. The same can be said for the puzzles themselves; a grid of hexagons on a white backdrop. To me this is good design, as I'm here for the puzzles and that's where the focus clearly lies.The 30 puzzles themselves are interesting and there are enough additions in terms of new rules/clues during the course of a playthrough to keep them fresh and interesting. I just wish there were more.However, this does not mean that the game is without flaws. For instance, it is not possible to erase a save slot so starting completely from scratch is not an option if all three slots are in use. Furthermore, the puzzles tend to be on the easy side, for me anyways.My biggest problem with the game is that there is no option to save mid-puzzle forcing you to either finish it or redo the part you already completed next time.All that being said, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and would recommend it as the pros outweigh the cons for me. I would encourage those interested in puzzle games to give this one a try."

First, if you get easily addicted to logic puzzles, Hexcells Plus will keep you thinking for much, much longer.

I didn't expect much, so it was a pleasant surprise to find a true logic game.Though Hexcells borrows elements from several different puzzle games, I was most reminded of nonograms, also known as Picross or Hanjie, which I've solved hundreds of by hand and in video games. As with nonograms, the game's beauty lies in the fact that the rules are are simple and it is purely logic-based (instead of relying on gimmicks or time-limits). That means that even in the later puzzles, which can be a bit challenging, you never have to resort to guess-work and anyone can solve them easily with enough focus and time.It's true the game was far too short (you can get 100% completion in a few hours), but now that I've tried it I would recommend it even at full price, though of course preferably wait for a sale. Apparently, the third installment has a random puzzle generator, which soundss like exactly the kind of thing this kind of game needs, but I will have to try it to see.

The early levels teach you the basics, and you'll be introduced to more rules as you progress into the later levels.There's plenty of ""ah ha!"" moments as you use deductive reasoning to determine if an orange hex should be marked as blue, or uncovered to reveal a numeric value about the adjacent cells.  The goal is to find ""x"" number of blue hexes in the level, where x is different for each level.  As you uncover more and more numeric cells, the more information you have about which remaining orange hexes are blue or numeric.The only downside is that the game was over before I knew it.  I completed all levels, re-doing a few to get the elusive ""0 mistakes"" in each level, and it only took me 5.5 hours.  And that's being generous (I got up to use bathroom, blow nose, etc, while game was running a few times).I did buy the game though in the Hexcells Complete bundle, which comes with two sequels, that I have yet to play.

Recommended for fans of Minesweeper/Picross, at the price that you feel is appropriate for about 1.5 hours of play.I have a fair amount of experience with Minesweeper and Picross-style puzzles, so this felt straightforward and fun. Hexcells ends up using the same logic you'd use for those games. All puzzles are 100% prove-able; there's no forced guessing between multiple spaces. I didn't notice anywhere that I had to string together much ""if this, then this, then this, no that won't work""...no giant cascading logic messes. Comfortable and casual all the way through.Some cautions:-- Unlike some similar games, you aren't marking tiles in a toggle-able way. That is, once you left- or right-click on a tile, it will immediately be shown to be correct or incorrect (which costs you a mistake).-- To me, the default left and right click felt backwards. I restarted the game and swapped them in the pre-game settings window with no problem.-- I played through almost the entire game in a windowed smaller resolution. Puzzle 29 did not fit entirely in the window, and I couldn't find any way to scroll or scale so I could see the whole puzzle. I had to exit back out and start again with non-windowed 1080p, since I figured that would be safe for all puzzles.-- The level select screen does not seem to indicate which puzzles you used a ""mistake"" on, so it looks like it would be annoying to go back and figure that out after the fact. I'd recommend that you immediately retry puzzles if you're aiming for the (very obtainable) perfect achievement, or at least write down which puzzles you'd need to retry later.Don't get me wrong, these cautions are all very minor. I enjoyed this quick game."

As you progress through the levels, you are also introduced to some new mechanics accompained by a tutorial level to make sure that you understand them. Because the puzzles are carefully and wonderfully designed, you never have to guess your next move, but finding it gets hard in the later puzzles. The interface is clean and the sound effects are cool. Hexcells is easy, Hexcells Plus gets harder in the second half and Hexcells Infinite steps back a little at the beginning, but in the end offers the most challenging puzzles. It also comes with a seed-based puzzle generator, adding 999,999,999 additional puzzles (even if they aren't hand crafted, they're still good).

I completed the game on a lazy Saturday and it gave me enough challenge that it didn't feel like a breeze. Additionally, it never vexed me by being too difficult or requiring me to know the intricacies of how everything worked (those hidden rules you find after doing a puzzle for a long time).If there's one thing to note, it's that the ""Perfectionist"" achievement does NOT require you to get 0 mistakes on all levels, just to get all of those hexagonal ""points"". This is good, because there's several levels where I got 1 honest mistake and it didn't deduct anything.The game also punishes random ""spam n' solve"" play by making it impossible to unlock later levels without X number of aforementioned hexagonal points. Why you would do that anyway is beyond me.My only critique of the game is a lack of puzzles with all the elements added. Initially, the game starts off by showing you the base points, then shows you that lines and columns can have numbers too, and then shows you how to toggle everything; and suddenly, you're two-thirds of the way through the puzzles. Just a minor gripe, but getting Hexcells Plus & Infinite solves that problem nicely."

They're added overtime, just so the player can get comfortable with the new skills they're learning though the previous levels. If you're hungry for a new kind of minesweeper, complete with an ambient soundtrack, a smooth difficulty curve, and a whole lotta hexagons, you can't go wrong with Hexcells...I do warn you that the game might feel a bit short, but hey, that's what Hexcells Infinite is for..

The only downside is that you can finish the game pretty quickly if you're good, and there's no replay value. Get the complete Hexcell package instead, especially if it's on sale."

I had ideas for years on how to improve Minesweeper to make it less punishing and more fun for casual players. You managed to improve on every aspect of this really frustrating classic. You stole my ideas ;(Everbody who has any fleeting interest in Minesweeper like games, should play this. It's perfect for what it is:Elegant, easy to get into, but not that hard to master and the best aspect is there is no randomness. If you mess up, it's totally your own fault. There are no frustrating 50/50 situations in corners like in Minesweeper, where you lose all motivation if you f***** up. You get a small penalty for messing up but it isn't ruining your day like in Minesweeper.Puzzle Design is also top notch. Especially the difficulty progression is perfect. All gameplay elements are easy to understand and are well implemented into the puzzle design. There are no unfair difficulty spikes. Again, ELEGANT as f***.Heck, my father understood this game from the get-go.The User Interface is also for a lack of a better word, ELEGANT. Every element is perfectly simple and easy to understand.The Music is also perfect for this. It's relaxing and helps you to concentrate to solve the puzzles. Nothing fancy but perfectly fitting.I almost forgot the best aspect:IT'S CHEAP. Even without discounts it's only 2,99. I played it for about 6 hours and it's totally worth it.TL;DRHexcells should be the superlative of elegant. It's the best puzzle game ever. Buy and play it. Buy it again for your parents and friends.Best regardsD3adalusP.S.I forgive you for stealing my ideas. Hexcells is way better than my imaginary game anyways :D"

The ability to shift click a cell and change it into a different color (for times you want to test things out without making a selection).2.

However, I had some problems with the music because it has a rhytmic structure that sets my pace at marking cells (I know it sounds crazy, but if I try to go off-beat I often make mistakes!).The game is quite addictive and works brilliantly.

However, it is vastly different from minesweeper in that each puzzle can be solved logicially wihout guesswork.   Each revealed cell shows the number of adjacent filled cells, but there can be other clues as well, for example, the number of filled cells in a column, row, or diagonal.  In this way it also reminds me a of sudoko puzzles.   There is no timer, and if you make a mistake you can either continue on or restart to try for a ""pefect"" solution, so one can procede at whatever pace you like.Very enjoyable if you like this sort of logic puzzle."

Guess i'm too used to this esoteric mechanic from the Windows Minesweeper. :-)- I can't detect any highlight (or shadow) of the not-yet-perfected levels! Do i have to go through all of them to get the final achievement?! :-s {-1}* No volume control for the music: it's just 100% or 0%. At least i can mute it.* No randomization. As a programmer myself, i would expect ""generate board and try to solve"" is not that difficult to include. Though, TBF, Hexcells Infinite does contain a random puzzle generator.- No ""level title"" to tell me which level i'm currently solving. I usually minimize (or alt+tab out of) the game, and don't remember this bit of detail when i come back to it... Also, when going to the next level, i usually lose track. Guess exiting to menu to check which level is the first one unsolved is doable... But it's annoying. {-0.5}* The ""column-counter"" hints can initially be easily misinterpreted to be ""neighbour-counter"" hints that are just placed on an invisible tile... Which might lead to mistakes! Eh, i guess it just takes a bit to get used to them. {-0.5}*The ""column-counter"" hints don't get highlighted when they're complete. Guess i'm too used to how Picross / Griddlers work. :-)Oh, so i have to manually do it... AND there's a guideline too?! Why is this mentioned so late after introducing the ""outside number"" hints?? :-< {-0.5}* Cannot save level state... {-0.5}* Inconsistent mechanic of the ""-X-"" hints, when they're inside a cell or outside the board... {-0.5}- No ""Exit"" button. Most people don't really need it, but it still would've been nice to have.Total: +0.5... So close to not recommending. xDUpdate 2017-07-01: three of the dislikes i stated above are now somewhat addressed. Maybe they were from the start and i missed them, or maybe they were implemented in the mean time. But i still believe the level number (why is this NOT the x-y combo from the menu, but a counter not shown anywhere else?!), the Quit button, and the difference between perfected and completed-with-mistakes levels are WAY too faint to be really noticeable. :-s"

I never got tired of how the reveal sounds synced up to the music.The only downside - and a small one at that - is that you can 'cheat' by flicking the mouse quickly over a hex and seeing a glimpse of the colour underneath.
