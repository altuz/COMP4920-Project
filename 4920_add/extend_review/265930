,Recommended,265930,15659106,"Posted: 2 May, 2015",all,Tom,"So I was deciding whether to do a serious review on Goat Simulator because I haven't seen one on Steam; so rather than join the bandwagon of unfunny jokey reviews for the game, I'll stick to my guns...Goat Simulator does exactly what it says on the tin; you play as a Goat, You cause havoc wherever you go; trashing, bashing, causing explosions, destroying houses, jumping on trampolines, basically anything you want. With plenty of interactive objects in the game, you can spend plenty of time wandering around never finding a dull moment.The graphics in goat simulator are really nice. They aren't on the levels of Evolve or something, but for this type of game, you aren't really going to be playing for the top of the range graphics.  The music and audio are exactly what you would expect here; derpy music in the background as you potter about the city, along with cries of fear from the civilians as the demon goat runs rampant.There are three different areas in Goat Simulator; each zone is huge, ranging from theme parks, to crop fields, every building has something to do in it, every room has something to interact with or destroy. I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with either of the levels included here.  There is nothing difficult in the game to do here at all. There are no real objectives, just an open world sandbox game where you do whatever you want, whenever you want.I have managed to put about twenty hours into Goat Simulator; most of this time was playing on local screen co-op with my girlfriend, and then a couple more hours’ achievement hunting, and boy there is some pretty ridiculous achievements to do. Other than the developers openly coming out stating that they would not be fixing any bugs in the game, I had no real game breaking bugs, apart from sometimes falling through the world; however this was fixed easily by just respawning again.If you want a game that is just purely for messing around in with no real aim and wanting some real stupidity, then Goat Simulator will give you plenty of fun; granted this type of game is not for everyone, I enjoyed it though.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you would like to follow my reviews more easily, be sure to join my group by clickinghere."

There are even glitches in the game on purpose that even make the game even more funny.

,Recommended,265930,31539168,Posted: 4 May,all,Capt_Blakhelm,"I'll spare you the joke review, and give you some info into wether you should actually buy Goat Simulator. Though, since the extremely silly nature of the game, joke reviews are probably fitting since you really have to be aligned with this games' sense of humor to get the most out of it.The hilarity of the game already escaped me prior to play because I already understood what the game's comedy is all out about in a single first impression/Let's play video - if you're still laughing throughout an entire video of Goat Simulator being played, then playing it should be a no brainer for you. If your first response is something like ""Oh, i get it. Absurd physics, and semi-glitchiness mixed with platforming, level exploration, destruction and Tony Hawk Pro Skater style scoring system"" and you aren't too amused, you can probably pass on Goat Simulator. I decided to bother because THPS scoring and level exploration appealed to me, but that soon wore off once I found the only reason to get score was to complete quests (or get on leaderboards). While doing insane combo strings in THPS is fun because of responsive controls, good level design, and time based challenge, Goat Simulator to me is less fun since you have to wrestle with wonky physics that will put get you stuck under objects or inside the level geometry, loosing your combo.Despite my negativity, I do find Goat Simulator amusing and I kinda like exploring the different part of level to see what non-sense the developers created, or to see how I can string together licking objects, headbutting people, jumping and tricking over things (front/backflips and/or spins), or blowing things up to see what kind of combos I can get. The quests aren't very well explained though, so if you can't quite figure them out from their vague descriptions, then you'd have to rely on a guide - if you're still willing to put up with completing the levels in the game. Goat Simulator is near exclusively a ""goof off"" game or something you play on TWitch/Youtube, or to show to friends for its absurdity. I don't know what happens when you ""complete"" a level, but I never felt like I was obtaining a goal by trying to.Coffee Stain Studio also deserves props for giving away the MMO expansion for free, and creating a surprisingly convincing simulation of an MMORPG experience - as the store page says, It felt like it was a real MMO, with real players moving, fighting and chatting. The GoatZ addon seems to have a decent amount of content and different ""survival game like gameplay"", but by that point, I've already lost interest, especially since my goat got glitched nside a wall and I wasn't able to respawn like yoiu could in the other modes/levels.Goat Simulator didn't hold my attention once I figured out the breadth of the gameplay, and I lost interest fairly quickly. That said, the game does exactly as it intended and there is some amusing content here. I'm giving Goat Simulator a positive recommendation if you are seeking a non-sensical, Tony Hawk style, physics based platforming sandbox, for some reason, (say if you like score attack games or questing/platforming). If the humor does little to nothing for you, than the gameplay likely won't either."

Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.For a Rocky Road Bar:1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan.

Over the past few years the simulation game market has taken a page from Reality TV and has attempted to adapt every  imaginable banal blue collar occupation into a video game. The men and women who lead quiet lives of desperation as lumberjacks, farmers, truck driver, warehouse logistics managers and car mechanics have all been memorialized with insipid games that are mostly purchased by the same people who wear socks with sandals, have closets full of sweater vests and fastidiously maintain button collections. A few games have masked themselves as simulators but have delivered hilarious facsimiles of what they aim to simulate and perhaps the most absurd of these is Goat Simulator.Capra aegagrus hircus, the domestic goat; hero of goat simulator. This four legged beast yearns to escape from his suburban backyard confinement, to be free to lick and kick and headbutt to his heart's content. Utilizing this creature's amazing dexterity, unparalleled agility and immense headbutting strength you must roam and conquer the lands held by homo sapiens... Or something like that. Goat Simulator doesn't attempt to have a plot, instead it places players in the middle of a suburban sandbox allowing them to roam around and use their bearded four legged monstrosity to complete a list of objectives and rack up points. Imagine playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater without a time limit and instead of riding a skateboard, you filled the trotters of a barn yard creature... It's completely absurd and for the first hour or so a complete riot. The ragdolls and animations are intentionally ridiculous and the things your goat is able to do seem to have been the result of the the development team brainstorming while high and watching a Jackass marathon. Wearing a jetpack, sacrificing humans to satan, bouncing on trampolines, getting abducted by aliens and headbutting protestors are all normal Goat simulator activities. It's not a game that's meant to be taken seriously in the least. It's designed for pure hedonism and escapism.That said, Goat Simulator is not without surprises however. Few other modern games encourage exploration and experimentation in the same way that Goat Simulator does. The list of objectives can be tackled in any order and bumbling around the map uncovers secrets and Easter eggs. There are a few special items lying around that can prove useful and these are not highlighted in any way giving players a welcome surprise when they are able to pick them up and use them. Pretty much any and every object of interest that you can see can be reached in some way. A jetpack can allow you to clumsily propel your bearded barn yard dwelling beast through the air while a pitching machine can allow your goat to fling baseballs at people and, if you are creative, glide. There are two reasonably large areas to explore  containing more than the asking price's worth of things to see and ruin.When it comes to ruin, there are a few flaws that present themselves and diminish players desire to live out their wildest fantasies as a goat. The controls, and in particular the camera, are a bit sloppy making some moments where more precise movement is required a bit taxing. The camera has a tendency to clip through some walls making navigating tight spaces a chore. Controlling the bike is initially frustrating since it uses the mouse to steer and this simultaneously operates the camera. More vexing is the way multiple special abilities and mutators stack. By completing special actions your goat earns special abilities and these abilities are almost always mapped to the same key. There is no way to toggle between what special ability is active so each time you attempt to use a special ability several things happen simultaneously. For instance, there is a mutator that allows you to summon sperm whales from the sky and if you also have the mutator that allows you to drop Minecraft style blocks you will find that each time you toggle what type of block you wish to deploy moby♥♥♥♥♥♥drops from the sky like some sort of  divine curse cluttering the area. What's worse, creatures that are summoned do not despawn and after a while this will take a toll on your frame rate.The developer of Goat Simulator has consciously neglected to fix any bugs that don't affect the stability of the game simply for amusement purposes. The problem is that physics bugs are the to video games what fart jokes are to cinema—decidedly low brow and with each cheap laugh the return is greatly diminished. Within the first hour, most players will exhaust the game of all it's humor leaving only the appeal of discovering what lies in the game world's nooks and crannies. Physics bugs are not the only imperfections that linger in goat simulator, some surfaces can be clipped through and may leave players trapped. Fortunately, a respawn option keeps any progress from being lost. A single horrible looping track makes up most of the soundtrack in Goat Simulator and makes playing for more than an hour or two nearly impossible. There are some additional tracks in specific areas of the game world but they don't offer much of a reprieve from the obnoxious primary track. Needless to say many players will have a love hate relationship with the games very deliberate lack of polish.Being an urbanite, I must confess to knowing nothing about goats going into goat Simulator and after putting a half dozen hours into it I still know nothing about goats. That's just as well since the low brow laughs and stupidity provided by Goat Simulator are far more welcome than what sweater vest wearing button collectors might demand from such a title. The decision to keep this simulator rough around the edges works against it as much as for it but at the end of the day this clunky little title provides sufficient amusement to justify its asking price."

It is unlike anything else I have ever played before.Goat Simulator originally was a hoax, a trailer from Swedish based Coffee Stain Studios poking fun at the seemingly endless barrage of mind numbingly boring simulators flooding the market, but as the collective response of the mentally challenged individuals on the web screamed YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS GAME, there was only one obvious rout to go, and thus Goat Simulator was born.With a very short development time Coffee Stain Studios have admitted there are bugs [and will only fix game breaking ones], but ask you embrace them as they make the game more entertaining. I mean how was a Goat supposed to climb a ladder anyways?The objective, if you can call it that is to mooch about doing everyday goat activities, like destroying Goat hendg, interrupting protests about pennies shaped foods, destroying Coffee Stain Studios office, sacrificing unsuspecting individuals to become a satanic goat, welding almost any object with your tongue, bouncing on trampolines, riding bicycles, eating mushrooms, being abducted by aliens, buying hats, licking anything and everything, parkour, taking over deadmau5 rooftop party, strapping fireworks to your back, pushing boulders into garden barbeques, Ow, if you were expecting things to make sense then you’re an idiot.Now with the addition of 4 DLC’s, MMO, Goatz, Payday & Waste of Space you can expand the bazaar & ultimately pointless shenanigans of the everyday life of a Goat and its friends it numerous ways. Adding story arcs, new maps, vehicles, quests and more, if you were one of the weird people that enjoyed the base game then this is more of the same on a stupider and grander scale.WARNING: This game may leave your with a fetish for Goats, I know it has for me.   10/10"

The game's own developer derides it, claiming the $10 it costs could be better spent on a bunch of bricks, and suggesting it'll be worth picking up in a two dollar sale.There is an interesting question to be had with Goat Simulator - when does pointing out one's own flaws cross the line from charmingly self-deprecating to conceitedly galling? Satirizing bad game design is something that games regularly fail at, because they fall into the trap of simply being the thing they're mocking. Roleplaying games that make fun of obligatory ""killing rats in the basement"" quests are simply hypocritical if they point out this cliche by making you go through with such a quest.Coffee Stain Studios is clearly having fun with the idea of knowingly selling a bad product. It proudly lists bugs as a feature, promising only to fix glitches that outright crash the game, leaving in everything else for hilarity's sake. With its bizarre physics and distinct lack of structure, one could make the case that Goat Simulator has a point to prove, providing a savvy commentary on the state of videogame design - not to mention the temptation of the modern game developer to make bizarre, ""random"" experiences simply to appeal to YouTube's Let's Play creators.The basics of Goat Simulator are as simple as simple gets - you are a goat, and you smash stuff up. Clicking the mouse as you run about causes the goat to smash things in his path, and pretty much everything exists to be smashed. From fences, to greenhouses, to cars and people, you're required to bash, explode, or otherwise ruin whatever you can get within bleating distance of. Essentially, that's the whole point, and there's very little to worry about beyond that.As you may have guessed by now, the game is a complete mess, and that's supposed to be part of the charm. The physics are insane, our titular goat liable to turn into a ragdoll at the slightest provocation, while random bric-a-brac bounces weightlessly around the environment with a mere touch.For a short while, Goat Simulator is pretty damn entertaining. It nails what made the ""Insurance Fraud"" minigames of Saints Row so much fun, and expands on the idea in a few amusing ways. With its fairly small map, and limited range of interactions, however, all the goat-based mayhem quickly becomes another Nobi Nobi Boy or Cargo situation - it's a delightfully eccentric experience that suffers from having way more fun with itself than the player can have.Ultimately, this game is a joke, and it's a joke with a limited shelf life. The humor soon wears off once you've made all the humans run screaming and sent your trotting little beast flying into the air with the help of a few industrial fans. While there are some great little secrets to discover, you only ever need to see them once, and there's very little to keep returning to the game for.As well as the vanilla experience, you can mutate your goat with various unique traits, all of which offer a chuckle the first time around. You can give your goat a ""Yoshi"" mutation, which lets him swallow items to make bombs, or give him the physical form of a giraffe just because it looks rather funny. These extra modes can extend the running joke a little while, but not for very long.As a joke, as a piece of interactive comedy, Goat Simulator is an undoubted success. The sheer concept is damn funny, and as you see everything for the first time, it's hard not to let a big grin spread across your face. Like all good gags, however, there's only so far it can be taken before it stops raising a smile, and by its very nature, Goat Simulator doesn't have the legs to last more than a short while."

A few months go by and the ""MMO Update"" came out, and I played it for an  hour until I had enough and left it alone because it was not fun. This game started a trend where people made bad simulator for the ""lols"" of it, which is dumb because it really is just a joke. Goat simulator tried to parody all the bad simulators that were out there before it but it just added itself to the pile of them. After this game a bunch of games got realeased: ""Rock Sim"" and ""Grass Sim"" and the list goes on and on which are all crap and are built around being crap like Goat Sim.The whole point of Goat Simulator is that it's glitchy and it's suppose to be bad but that in my opinion is just a dumb concept to build a game around. If lets say an item gets shot into outher space in a shooter or a similar game, it's halarious because that doesn't usually happen but in Goat Sim it's more like:I'm gonna walk this way, oh my goat glitched into the floor lol ok (respawns)Oh my goat  glitched and flew of to space.... I guess that's funny but now I have to walk all the way over there again.Ok I have to deliver this item to someone better grab it with my to- o it glitched, yet again..... x how much time you spend on this gamePros:+Funny for the first 30 mins+Collectibles to find across the maps+Funny references to other things+ Slow motion button  which is lovelyHalf Pros Half Cons:-/+Lots of easter eggs (too many and they get quiet repetitive)Cons:-The game is too glitchy to actually play-Tiny maps and a boring MMO map in the sense that it isn't creative in any way shape or form-Jokes that are childish-Jokes that are suppose to be funny but don't actually make sense (Played as a microave for example)-The score system can be beaten super easily so there is no point for it-If you try to knock over people they just get back up so there is no point of doing that-The ""AI"" is poop- Extremely annoying soundtrack that just loops around 3 songs-Jetpack is pointless because it just spirals out of control-30 fps cap-Ridiculous pop-inOverall 4/10 Don't buy this game just for the LOLS because you are just supporting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.""If you try to make a bad game and succeed, you've made a bad game!

It's a plane! IT'S ＧＯＡＴ ＣＥＮＡ!!!!!I really like the open-world concept in this game that you can do pretty much everything as a goat. It really gives the casual GrandTheftGoat Auto feels with no missions and storyline attached unless you're chasing for those achievements which require a bit of an effort. The ragdolls, wallclimbing and other various animations are very funny to see, although climbing ladders with your head is a bit weird. Some of the achievements, side-quests and dialogues are trolls and very meme-like. Yes, there's even achievements for crashing your game and getting stucked in a demonic chamber. The mechanics and materials of this game are very idealistic and fun to enjoy at. I beat Michael bay Turtles and now I'm happy with my life. Well... at least that's what most of us wants.I can't say this game has the best graphics I've ever played though, I ran this game at a lower resolution due to my weak graphic card and I'm unable to fully judge the graphic smoothness and quality. Based on my opinion though, I honestly think that it's good enough to prevent people from complaining. Of course, with big plays come big bugs, some model glitches still happened and thank god the devs added the respawn button for it. Overall, I'll give this game a good-to-go ratings for the graphics.Let's move up to my favourite part! The MMO mode!I mean who doesn't love MMO?!Let me tell you a stupid story, I thought it was real people chatting in the MMO mode during my first play. I even tried to talk to them kek. The MMO chats are very realistic with people saying random stuff and even sending random guild invites to you! What's even more amusing? After I lurked around the game's forum a bit the devs actually used the discussions in the forum for the fake chats! There's even some lagging players and spinning around like a beyblade or something. The mimics such as the ""connecting"" screen did a very good job on simulating the real MMO loading screen. The quests are interesting to do, there's a lot funny stuff happened in the Goat realm, and I really have to say that I love the old school British name used in the MMO! :)Therefore, I'm proudly giving this game a solid good rating for the simulation, concepts and ideas.My recommendation: Buy this during an offer and play for stress-relieving, or just buy at full price if it doesn't worth the wait lol. It's worth a shot for casual players :)for people with overflowing money"

,Not Recommended,265930,17647502,"Posted: 21 August, 2015",all,JacquesLeSauve,"This isn't going to be a very popular opinion, but I really didn't like this game. I wanted to, and I tried hard to, I really, really did. It looked fun in videos, it came highly recommended by friends and it was on sale at the time I bought it. I should have had a blast with it. But this just doesn't do anything for me.A brief history for those not in the know, courtesy of Wikipedia, arguably the best pedia on the internet. Goat Simulator started off life as a prototype born from a game jam with the aim being to help developers better learn how to use Unreal Engine. Never intended for human consumption, a posted video went viral and demand pushed the creators to release the game proper, followed several months after by two sizable, free updates adding whole new areas, objectives and gameplay mechanics. It's a great little indie success story that shows how a good idea can be enough to capture people's imagination and wallets. Plus goats. Goats helped a lot there, too. So where did it all go wrong for me? Ultimately, I just didn't have any fun with it at any point.Play as a goat and cause general havoc to several areas and their denizens with a combination of wild goat moves, poor morals and bad physics. There are objectives in each area, but they really only serve as loose signposts to gently nudge the player to experiment with the different elements of the game. It's largely a destructive sandbox where you make your own fun and craft your own little adventure through the chaos. But the joke is that just about everything is intentionally bad. The AI has all the intelligence of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ potato, the physics seems to have something of a mind of its own and nothing really makes any sense, it just exists... because. All of that is absolutely fine and I can't fault the goal they were aiming for. But it just never feels like it works for me.As strange as it sounds, the joke doesn't feel ""earned"" here. Playing a game where the punch line is ""look at how broken this is"", but seeing it in something that's broken by design, just isn't very satisfying. Like... when you're watching dragons fly backwards in Skyrim or faceless teeth and eyes having a serious, heartfelt conversation with you in Assassin's Creed, that's proper p*ss yourself funny exactly because it's not supposed to be there. But when a game is filled with these kinds of things on purpose it loses what made it funny in the first place. I heard a great quote once, which I'm about to totally butcher, that to make people laugh is easy, you just put on an old lady wig and an old lady dress and some old lady glasses and you fall over, that's enough. But to make a comedian laugh it has to be a real old lady falling. And that's what this game feels like to me, it's someone in a silly wig and glasses falling over.In fairness, the free MMO update content is much better at hitting its target as it parodies all the tired old tropes of RPGs. Having a fetch quest where the items are literally surrounding the quest-giver, or an escort mission with the slowest NPC ever committed to code, or a chat box perfectly recreating the kind of inane drivel sometimes seen from a minority of bad players that makes you damn near suicidal... all of these things really have something to say and make their point beautifully. But for me it just felt like too little too late.For all the people who do love this game, I can't tell them they're wrong. If you enjoy something then it needs no further explanation or justification, that you had fun with it is all that matters, and I wish I could be in that group. But, sadly, if anyone asked then I couldn't recommend this. Go play Just Cause or Saint's Row for your sandbox mayhem shenanigans. Or better yet, go outside and punch a real goat. Aside from the social contempt and court fines, it's absolutely free!"

It is definately a great value for the price as I have had a blast playing this game with my four year old who finds the game as hilarious and silly as I do. He quickly learned how to play the game and has been enjoying the open world aspect of it (his favorite type of games). With Steam Workshop already in place and free content already annoumced, I look forward to see what is in store for this game with great delight.When I attempted to set up the controls for this game on a Steam Controller, I did not have much success. I hope to see that changed as I know it would increase how much fun I am having with the game. Better improvement for mods would be nice as it seems a number of them on Steam Workshop require a seperate installation of the game in 64bit. Thankfully the game does have a respawn function when game breaking glitches happen and you are left stranded in objects, in the ground, or in the air. With a game this zany, I would never expect realistic but a little bit better handling on the jumping in the game would be nice.Over all, this game is definately one of the best entertainment values I have stumbled upon in recent history.

,Recommended,265930,9774303,"Posted: 9 April, 2014",all,crunchyfrog,"It's abundantly clear from the title (and the internet hype) that this game is silly, pure and unadulterated silliness. I make no apologies for saying that's enough to sell it to me. But is the game any good? What does it do? Is it worth buying (being perhaps the ultimate question)?Let's tackle what it is. Well, it says on the tin, as it were. It's a sandbox bugger-about (if that isn't a genre it damned well should be). Your goat emulates Tony Hawk in a rather straightforward (but oddly-sounding) way - you can jump, flip, headbutt, and lick - the latter which allow you to pick things up and wander around with them, flailing-weapon-like. As already stated, it's a free-for-all bugger around in a sandbox townscape. There are some collectables to find, game mode tweaks to unlock, and special tricks (usually with accompanying in-jokes) to perform; the latter being the real meat of the game.Is it any good, though? Yes and no.As before, it's patently obvious what it is, but the real downsides are that there is so little content here. The single environment is sadly very small, so you can easily find every nook and cranny therein within a couple of hours. But, somewhat worse, it does tend to tire some time before that; in other words, the chuckles wear thin fairly quickly, as they do with any joke once heard or experienced the first time. So, in such cases, you NEED something else to offer to fall back on, and sadly there just isn't enough for that.The tricks you need to perform (they are sequential, so you need to perform a given trick successfully before the next one appears) can also be romped through in short shrift, especially once you quickly work out the best places for performing them.So, the final question, is it worth buying? Well, the answer isn't really straightforward as it entirely depends on your own perspective.If you are OK with a couple of hours at best of silly entertainment, and the price is acceptable, then by all means go for it. It is what it is. The only warning I will add to this is to be prepared for some bad framerate issues - it isn't optimized at all at this point. My main desktop (a couple of years old) will potter along acceptably, if you consider drops to 30 FPS acceptable when you've busted up a few things (which means frequently). On my laptop which is above minimum recommended specs, forget it. 10 FPS is about it. That's the only real thing to beware.However, if you are a little more careful and considered with your purchases, then I would offer you a firm ""no"" for buying it - at least not yet.There's a couple of major reasons I say not yet. Firstly, the obvious one being as with all things Steam, a sale is imminent and there will be promotion soon enough. Secondly, from my experience with Coffee Stain studios, they are generally good guys. I bought Sanctum when it released, and the content was 3 (or maybe 4) maps at that time, but they added and updated repeatedly right up to the time before Sanctum2's release, so as far as money's-worth I DEFINITELY got it, as all this content was free. Their DLC was generous too, as they asked what we wanted to see as DLC and listened - so maps, in general, and they were well priced.I have no doubt they'll be adding to this game (and as of today have confirmed more free content for May), so it will improve. There is also the point that it has Steam Workshop support, and mods have been coming in pretty quick already, so I have no doubt this will be pretty well supported and will grow.So in summary, I'd urge to wait and get it in a couple of months."

,Recommended,265930,9729976,"Posted: 4 April, 2014",all,boat,"Thoroughly enjoyed Goat Simulator 2014. Goat/10.Goat Simulator 2014 gives an in-depth experience that uses a wide range of engaging stimulus and challenges to educate us humans of the agricultural environment that a goat must endure through it's life. The inspiring story of Goat overcoming his/her oppressors (the humans) creates an amazing storyline, with numerous plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat. I know what you're thinking, ""but its just a goat!"" Shut the hell up you fool, although this may be 'just a goat', this is 'just a goat' that broke through its goat expectations and stereotypes to face the world with nothing but its hyper-elastic tongue and it's oddly unnatural ability to not die. Ever. Goat Simulator 2014 expertly demonstrates how political views and actions can affect not only mankind, but also goats. It confronts the player with many terrifying situations (and can at times cause great offense). One example of this is the many rules and regulations imposed by the goverment, like what the hell? You want to keep me in this goat pen? Do you think this tower will keep me happy? This game allows you to fight the power, and essentially ""♥♥♥♥ the police"". The most controversial aspect of this game is most definitely the goat fight scene, where you must turn against your fellow goats for the pleasure of the humans. Who really wants to participate in a competitive blood bath of goats for someone else's entertainment? In my honest opinion, I would much rather prefer that to not be a part of the game. Although I may not be condoning goat on goat violence, I find mowing down the many so called 'innocent' civilians and sacrificing them to the Lord Satan gives me an enjoyable rush. This game has the potential to inspire many, whether they want to become a goat scientist, goat gymnast, goat astronaut, goat ball pitcher or whale, they will find this game absolutely enthralling. The Good Goat VS Bad Goat dynamic of Goat Simulator gives the player the ability to influence the goat's decisions, and essentially determine to be Good Goat, or Bad Goat. (I also have the sneaking suspicions that recent games such as Infamous: SECOND SUN (what does that even mean?) have copied this genius game mechanic from Goat Simulator 2014.)I recommend this game as it accurately depicts the various aspects of survival that a goat must face in it's day to life, and does so in a way that us humans can relate to and take advice from in both an entertaining and interesting way. This game forces you to think. I love it."

Just when you think it can't get any weirder, this game will blow your mind. It has references to nearly every geeky thing you can think of, from The IT Crowd to South Park to Bravest Warriors.A lot of games out there have stupid achievements. As a completionist, I feel compelled to 100% each game in my collection even though it kills me a little inside. With Goat Simulator, you can breeze through all the achievements in a few hours if that's what you want - the mutations make it super easy. But I didn't take the easy route. For all its frustrating bits, I wanted to do everything this game has to offer, and I wanted to do it legit. Aside from a few gems like Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV, not many games can do that.If you want hours upon hours of replayable, sandboxy goodness with the option of getting serious now and then, Goat Simulator is for you."

The game itself is also pretty glitchy.The joke wears thin very fast, which is the game's main selling point. I mean, there's only so many times you can watch a goat blow up.

,Recommended,265930,9882673,"Posted: 20 April, 2014",all,snot,"Alright, so this my first time reviewing a game on Steam, and I felt I had to do it because this game is really awesome. It's huge in every sense of the word - long, hard (that's what she said :P) and has a level of freedom you wouldn't expect from a game more than ten years old. You can do pretty much everything you want - sleep, grill meat, forge weapons, make potions, skin animals and take their teeth and even smoke pot and sell it for profit - and go anywhere you want in the game's world without a quest asking you to go there.The sun rises and sets, NPC sleep, wake up, work, gather to talk with each other, etc. etc.Being a simulator, the development of the character is always important in such a genre, and Goat simulator really shines in that department. You start as a poor weakling who gets beaten up by everyone and hardly can kick harmless little creatures called meatbugs. Then, as you complete quests and defeat enemies, you gain XP which can be converted in strength, dexterity and mana points. You go all the way to a badass warrior, a lethal ranger or a supreme mage - you chose how you want to play it.As for the bad parts, I just can think of one: the game is VERY buggy, and that can totally ruin your game experience if you don't know how to avoid it.A few important considerations about the game if you want to play and enjoy it:- Steam doesn't provide a game manual for Goat sim, and that truly sucks. If there are some games which you can start playing without reading the manual first - most modern games carry in-game tutorials - this is NOT one of them. The controls are a bit akward and if you don't read about them first I guarantee you won't be able to play the game at all. Just visit the Steam community page and you'll easily find a link to download the official manual in PDF.- You can and you SHOULD run the game on Windows 7. My desktop computer is a Pentium IV with Windows XP, and I thought It would be better choice for this game to avoid system compatibility issues. Well, that was a mistake. The game kept crashing anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes of gameplay, especially when facing multiple foes, not to mention some inventory items didn't even show the picture. I googled it and updated all my Nvidia and sound card drivers, but the problems aforementioned remained unchanged. I was very close to quit playing the game at all, but I thought what the heck, let me try it on my laptop which runs on W 7. It got A LOT better. It only crashed about 10% of the time (ah ah), especially during the first visit to the Sleeper's temple (be sure to save a lot there) and the inventory issue got fixed. I don't know about Vista or 8, but the game seems to like Windows 7. Oh, and make sure to disable Steam interface during gameplay, or the game might not start at all.- The game allows you to save whenever you want, so make sure you take advantage of it. I suggest this not for cheating purposes, but to avoid losing your game progress due to a crash or even worse, some bug where a gate doesn't open when it was supposed to or you end up killing NPCs vital to the plot who shouldn't be allowed to die at that point of the game.- Get a walkthrough. I suggest the one by JemyM, which you can easily find online. Again, I recommend it not for cheating (you can even skip the walkthrough part per se) but for the unvaluable information it contains regarding gameplay and common bugs and how to avoid them.- Go to a place likesteamcommunity.comand download the map pictures. Trust me, you will need them.- If you're more into action games, maybe this game is not for you. Through most part of the game (especially the first chapters), you keep running from place to place around the colony, doing chores for other people, looking for objects, etc. Sure, later you'll feel like an invencible killing machine - it felt VERY rewarding going back to the Old Camp and slaughtering all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who mugged me in the beginning :P - but it takes a while to get there. Play this game for the RPG experience and the story, and you will enjoy it."

76561198112486897,Recommended,265930,9929358,"Posted: 25 April, 2014",all,Bearing Witness,"Going through life I had always felt as though I was missing something, as if there was some unfillable hole deep within me; a need for something greater in my life. This feeling is universal to the human experience and we scurry to and fro, doing our best to mask our deep longing for something greater with loves, friendships, drugs, and a myriad of other things. They let us ignore the longing we feel, even healing parts of our fractured soul. Unfortunately it is as the night sky, hidden merely by the rays of the Sun, waiting for that shining light to cease, so that it may once more drown us in darkness. However, do not despair my friends, for there is hope and its name is Goat Simulator.It is through this game that I managed to somehow transcend the human experience and become whole. Through the eyes of a goat I was shown the amazing beauty of the world surrounding me and the exquisitely wonderful part I had to play in this great epic we call human existence.When I first began, I looked upon the humans as if they were mere animals and my brethren as little better. I declared myself their ruler and soon after their God. The world was mine to do with as I pleased and with such awesome power my very being grew corrupt. Running around I at first reveled in the chaos left in my wake.  However, as I destroyed more and more, the world around me grew more chaotic to reflect my soul, until not even I could control the spiral of destruction I had begun and the world turned black.Traumatized by the unparalleled suffering I had wrought, I decided to start anew. With the care of a mother caressing her newborn, I traversed this new world, basking in the vibrancy of life and the harmony of nature. Every artificial construct, from a mere fence to a house, had become a symbol of the desire to create within us all. Nature, from a simple blade of grass to the tallest tree, became a symbol for all of life, ever growing, persisting through every obstacle to reach as high as possible. I realized that my goat brethren each had their own dreams, aspirations, and hopes. I treated them as I would myself, understanding that I was in no way their better. And through the humans, I understood that even life outside my own species was sacred. They might have had little thought beyond their own existence, indulging in carnal desire, but I realized our intimate and undeniable connection as living beings. I then flew high above the earth and looked down upon the town I had grown to love, seeing how small it truly was. That something so tiny could hold so many beautiful things brought me to tears.It was in that moment that I felt as if I had left my earthly shell to traverse past the mortal plane and experience an awe-inspiring connection to all of creation. I had reached Nirvana. I no longer sought power and status, only peace and happiness for all. I no longer reveled in destruction but in the creation of wondrous places and joy. The deep longing I had once felt was gone and replaced with a sense of belonging and boundless love. My Sun no longer sets, its euphoric rays forever shining down upon me, brightening my life and the life of those around me.It is no single realization that achieves this state of Nirvana; it is their summation and the clarity and swiftness with which they impact. I find that at this border of mundane and ethereal, words begin to fail and experience becomes your guide. So I ask, are you ready to break through the limits that your life’s finitude has placed upon you? Are you ready to become more than what you are now? Are you ready to become a goat?"

While lacking the grand scale of other sandbox games Goat Simulator carries the senseless destruction and near-boundless freedom that you can expect from a humble game made in less than a week. It is very easy to invest hours of gameplay into Goat Simulator especially with the implementation of Steam Workshop promising more content to be released in the future.A cheap and enjoyable game with a lighthearted approach, Goat Simulator will not fail to force out a few laughs."

,Recommended,265930,9708784,"Posted: 2 April, 2014",all,toastlord,"Pac-Man Championship Edition seemed like the perfect Xbox Live Arcade game when it arrived back in 2007 -- but an even better version is now available on PlayStation Network. Somehow, gaming's oldest mascot is delivering one of the most exciting games of the year. More mazes, more modes, more ghosts...lots more ghosts, actually. This ""deluxe"" version takes everything that made Championship Edition great and adds a bunch of cool new stuff. It's like taking a great white shark and adding laser beam eyes and saw blades that shoot out of its mouth.Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is all about gunning for a high score. Games are timed, so you need to eat as many pellets, fruits, and ghosts as possible before the clock stops. You don't die as often as you did in the original Pac-Man, you earn plenty of extra lives, and you have many bombs at your disposal to get out of tight spots. (Yes, Pac-Man can now trigger bombs that send all of the ghosts back to their hideout.) Without much fear of death, you can focus on the one thing that matters: representing on the online score boards.Pac-Man now has many more ghosts to contend with. Like, a hundred more. You'll see the spirits sleeping around a maze, and as Pac-Man whizzes by they'll wake up and give chase. Hold off on eating a Power Pellet long enough and you may find dozens of ghosts trailing behind you in a long conga line. Finally grabbing that Power Pellet and devouring a hundred ghosts in a row is one of the most satisfying things I've done in a game this year. This is also a key technique in getting those high scores.While the first Championship Edition was super fun, there were only a couple of mazes and modes. DX has nine mazes, most of which are new creations that offer a lot of variety. For example, Spiral has several coils that are easy to get trapped in. Dungeon, on the other hand, has long, cramped corridors. Each maze also has many game options such as Score Attack, Time Trials, and Ghost Combos (see how many ghosts you can eat with one Power Pellet). When you first dive into Championship Edition DX, only the standard Championship II course is unlocked, but each round you play usually unlocks a new maze or mode.Like I said, it's all about the high score, and Championship Edition DX provides many friendly ways to see how you rank against the competition. You can comb through the leaderboards for extensive data on all the many maps and modes, but there are other really nice touches: your current ranking is displayed right on the title screen, the Course Select screen, and again within the menu for each maze.Pac-Man Championship Edition DX also looks and sounds great. You can select from a variety of maze skins and character designs for each game, running from the 3D Pac-Mania characters to pixilated retro sprites. The lively electronic soundtrack builds in intensity as the game timer ticks down and always gets me leaning forward in my chair.THE VERDICTPac-Man Championship Edition DX boasts simple, addictive gameplay that will have you competing for high scores on the score boards for months. Everything that made the first game a hit is still here, accompanied by a bunch of new mazes, modes, and ghosts -- all for $10. It's hard to imagine a more perfect PlayStation Network game. This is a master class in game design: you will understand it instantly, enjoy it instantly, and want to play again and again.10/10 like skyrim but with guns"

,Recommended,265930,11459227,"Posted: 28 July, 2014",all,lovinglife139,"This game is unique. Truly, truly unique. In an age where most video games do take themselves seriously (as is understandable in a world that still somehow downplays video gaming as a valid, competitive piece of the entertainment industry as a whole), it is absolutely refreshing to see a game like this come out that's not trying to be a masterpiece, or tell an in-depth story. Goat Simulator is ridiculous, colorful, somewhat pointless, hilarious, and a ton of fun.I had an argument with my best friend, who said he thought it was ridiculous this game was getting so much attention because the Meta-Critic score left much to be desired. I think he missed the whole point.Goat Simulator has glitches. The world exists for no reason other than for you to rampage through it as a goat. The people who walk through this world will literally run into things such as street posts and fall down in a pile of tangled limbs. I saw one guy walk up over a concrete guardrail and into a river, where he proceeded to float down the river without trying to swim to safety. The physics don't make sense in this game and are barely realistic. The game has a ton of technical flaws. You get stuck. You can fall through floors and fly through walls. And yes, the frame rate drops frequently, particularly when I try to jetpack my goat into space, just as I burst through the earth's atmosphere.THAT'S the point. That throughout all of its flaws, it is still a hilarious ride through a ridiculous premise of a game that is not meant to win any awards, it is meant to be FUN. It is meant to be hilarious. It is meant to be there for you when you're having a bad day and just want to launch a game for a few minutes to feel better. To be honest, half of the time glitches happen, they're hilarious. They add to the game and are not a detriment at all. Even the frame rate drops don't bother me, because...I mean, come on. My goat is going to space with a freaking jetpack. The frame rate drop feels NECESSARY with something that epic.I recommend this game to pretty much everyone. It's cheap as it is, and on sale it's a steal. At the very least, you'll have a lot of fun and laughs for a few hours in a game so ridiculous it's a miracle it exists. This is a game that exists solely for fun and entertainment value, and that is what it succeeds at."
76561198118547297,Recommended,265930,9803550,"Posted: 12 April, 2014",all,Hazwold,"Goat Simulator is the latest in hircine emulation technology by developer Coffee Stain Studios, who you may remember as the developers of the not-so-goatish Sanctum games. The game is, as far as I can tell, the premium representation of farm life, in terms of goats, and shows the perfect flow of the life-cycle of the goat itself; doing stunts off of explosive cars is just an example of such things you can experience in this third-person open-world goat-em-up.All jokes aside, Goat Simulator is a collaborative effort by the guys at Coffee Stain which takes pride in it's stupendous outrageousness, your goat can get a jetpack and fly around the packed, albeit small, map that it calls it's home, or would you rather drop peasant goats from the sky as the queen of all that is goaty? Want to imbue the powers of the Goat Devil himself into a singularity of goat *I mean ""out""* of this world proportions? You can do that. Or just interested in floppin' it up with the new-fangled ""ragdoll-key""? Why not?!  When it comes to it, Goat Simulator is a buggy mess, and it embraces that- it's advertised as a ""feature"".However, while Goat Simulator's joke is very funny (or terrible, depending on your kind of humour) it can quickly go stale, after playing for about an hour, the lack ofthings to do has been getting to me, there are modifiers you can use, but there are very limited amounts of them. Goat Sim relies on experimentation but after a while there really isn't much to experiment with.It's hard to review a game like Goat Simulator, while it's a glitch-filled, ugly, and very small world, it uses that to it's advantage, the devs would say ""It's buggy but who cares because it's meant too be like that?"" and honestly I don't know whether to applaud or condemn Coffee Stain for that. At it's best Goat Simulator is a hilarious monstrosity but at it's worst it descends into monotony. I believe that the Steam Workshop will keep this game alive, however it requires a motive for modding in the first place, and at the price it's at, I don't think it'll get much of that. Goat Simulator is £6.99 here in the UK or around $9.99 USD or €8.99 EUR. Personally, I'd wait until it came down in price if you're interested in some goat based action.I can't really reccomend this game but I can't push you away from it. If you're good with slapstick generally silly humour then this might be for you, if not then keep a watch for major price drops. I'd reccomend waiting anyway. Hazwold out."

,Not Recommended,265930,9778452,"Posted: 10 April, 2014",all,Cantavanda,"This game sucks.Yes yes, it's an april fools joke, I understand, I have some humour. But ten euros for this disaster is just overpriced and it's one of the top selling games already for a week just because youtubers play it.So, there are multiple factors that make this game an abomination.The bugs, this game is one of the buggiest games I've ever seen, when you start to play it it is so funny HAHA THAT GOAT DOES FUNNY HAHA, but after a half hour all the jokes in this game become very repetitive and plain annoying. You can't walk without tripping over anything and then you have to wait until your goat stands up again, and three seconds later he's on the ground again. Also, when you're trying to do something it happens sometimes that you fly all over to the other side of the map because of a random programmed bug. And other situations are that you're trying to get on a roof for a trophy for the achievements, but you keep falling through the roof and then you have to climb up all your way back. And don't get me started on the bug that some 3d models like cars or trampolines don't appear until you're close to them.The controls, the controls are so annoying, your goat goes most of the time for no reason in ""muscles off"" mode, and sometimes it takes time to undo that, guess why, because the controls aren't responding. The game is set for a QWERTY keyboard, mine is AZERTY, in almost all games you can edit the controls, and in all of those they stay saved, but of course, in this one, the controls don't save, you have to redo the controls all the time again and again and it gets annoying quick, and because that you get stuck a lot, you have to reset the game again and again and that obviously correlates with resetting the controls. There are also some control bugs, like when you start a new game the controls are not responding, etc.... And the worst thing is the acceleration of your goat. Since you fall so much, you have to accelerate again, and it goes from very slow to fast that you can't control your goat, and when you stop your goat while running he might fall over.The achievements, most are very easy to get, it's fun getting a lot of achievements quick and seeing funny things, but then there are the unfair ones. And I mean unfair, not challenging. For example, the achievements of Payday 2 are insanely hard, but fair, the achievements of Angry Video Game Nerd adventures are hard, it's a hard platformer, but still, fair. But the achievements are this just♥♥♥♥♥♥you off so much. Let's take the all trophies one, some trophies are very easy to get, but others are on impossible locations with such big bugs that they're impossible to get that it takes you so many tries. Like the one under the fan, there is a spinning fan on a hard to reach location, and behind that fan theres a trophy, and the fan spins fast, and if you touch it you get rocketed to the other side of the map, that means you have to walk so much and fall over a lot again, reach that hard to reach location, and then try again. And since the controls are so annoying it's almost impossible to go over the fan, it took me so long and it was so annoying, but that's only one of the multiple hard to reach and unfair trophies. The jump on the five trampolines in one jump trophy is so annoying too because you can't see the trampolines until you are close to them because of bugs. So you have to search all the map for trampolines and perfectly remember their placement and then jump the very buggy jump controls which takes ages. And then there's the worst... the horrible... flappy goat achievement.... It's like flappy bird, but on a very small screen, full of bugs and much faster. So you go in a building and there's a tv there and on it flappy goat. The screen of that tv is small so you have to look very good, and it goes fast and you flap high. Also, the worst about it is the horrible collision, your goat touches the pipes even when it's not touching it, you really have to be far away from the pipes to not touch them, this took me a hour of pure frustration to do.Well, that's about it, this game is overrated, a disaster, overpriced and annoying. 1/10 just because it made me laugh in the first half hour"

This game has a lot of fun achievements. You will need all the dlc (besides the soundtrack) to get them all.I will now do the rest of this review entirely from an achievement hunter perspective.Considering there are over 100 achievements, I can't say that this is the best game for achievement hunters looking to add to their perfect game count, but even the hardest of achievements in this game are obtainable within at most an hour of play (with the hardest being the trophy collecting tasks).Each DLC comes with a good amount of achievements, most of which involve interacting with something located somewhere in the map (each DLC has a new map), and one where you need to collect all the hidden trophies (there are steam guides for everything, so it's not too hard).So like I said before; if you are hoping to get every achievement in this game, be prepared to spend a fair bit of time. Otherwise, going after these achievements are a lot of fun, and even if you aren't an achievement collector, the achievements can give you something extra to do.If achievement collectors even exist on Steam, I hope this review helped them."

For example-1) Goat's tounges are NOT adhesive, and they do not have the strength to pull along cars or people, as this game suggests.2) There is no Goat devil or angel - goats do not have a religion.3) The goat in this game can survive falls from extreme heights, explosions, being hit by cars, and being sucked into fans. Goats in real life are NOT immortal.4) Goats cannot perform front OR backflips, nor can they 'manual' on their front paws.5) In reality, Goats are NOT able to ride on Bikes or skateboards. Goats have a poor sense of balance, due to a natural inner-ear problem evident in their species  - this is perhaps the one thing this game portrays accurately.Overall, this game was extremely dissapointing.

,Recommended,265930,9745201,"Posted: 6 April, 2014",all,oyxer,"For years my goat enthusiast friends and I have been searching for a game that fully takes advantage of the many paradigms that goats have to offer. Coffee Stain Studios had a chance to capture a niche market looking for the ultimate in goat simulation software. I had considered investing thousands in computer peripherals to enhance my simulation experience, including buying a 640 by 480 monitor to better simulate goat vision, goat food trays for my desk as well as a conversion of my gaming room into a barn.  There was a palpable desire for this game amongst us in the goat enthusiast community for many years, and this game promised to deliver with realistic physics and visuals. For the past few months since I have heard about this game, I have begun eating nothing but dried grass and water and sat next to my calendar and my computer waiting for the game to be released. This game consumed me that the only thing I could say was “I love goats” in a vacant voice. I have not moved for 3 weeks now, my room smells horrible. My wife and kids have left me, but I’m not really sure because they didn’t matter now that Goat Simulator was on the horizon. Soon I could be the goat. Soon I would be ready to receive. My body most definitely was ready.However, much to my dismay, Coffee Stain Studios merely mocked us in the goat enthusiast community. This game was an utter disappointment. I want my goat simulators designed by goat experts, who have had years in the field. Clearly these people have never met goats. I have been a connoisseur in goats for over 30 years, and this game is nothing more than contrived misinformation by governments worldwide against the goat cause. There seems to be a vendetta against goats in this society, these ‘goatists’ such as the ones at Coffee Stain Studios have  insulted the entire goat race and they should apologise. I demand a refund. This goat persecution should not be tolerated. I have reached out to many news agencies to hear my plight, and I am hoping Anita Sarkeesian will address this issue in the next goatist frequency video.Pros:-	The New Lick Feature is much appreciated – it brought many things to the gameplay I did not expect possible with our current technology. I was able to realistically simulate goat.Cons:-	I was hoping for a 24/7 live updated, real time world with weather affects and PhysX GoatTM, with live feed satellite rendering of the earth’s surface so I could realistically move my goats between all the world’s major goat farming areas and enter my goat into beauty contests.-	The sacrifice area and devil goat were unnecessary. However, if you enjoyed scarier elements of games like Farming Simulator and Chemical Spillage Simulator, this would be right up your alley9/10 would play again."

ArmA has always been one for me that has brought me deep into the world of something I enjoy and given me a true to life, realistic perspective of what it would be like to live a day in those shoes. Goat Simulator however, takes it to a whole new level.I've watched goats for a long time now, studied them profusely and would in fact go as far as to call myself a Connoisseur of Goats, and what really impressed me about Goat Simulator is the sheer depth that it has achieved in making a goats daily life something that we can all enjoy. Whether you are simply exploring or as goats are prone to do, dragging a car up a water slide with your sticky tongue, you really feel like you're in the shoes of the Goat, or in its hooves should I say, and when you look at the physical properties the game accurately portrays of a goat in free fall or its impacting upon the ground, you really get a feel for just how passionately the R&D team on Goat Simulator studied the physical attributes of goats and their effects on the world for the games portrayle.I must say that as both an officionado of Goats and Simulators I couldn't ask for much more, however I am looking forward to a version that is compatible with Occulus Rift, so that I may see the world through a goats eyes. A tip to anybody who is seeking a more authentic, goatier expiriences, play the game with cups over your hands to simulate goat hooves, you will not be dissapointed, I promise you.10/10 - Redefines Perfection"

With the golden goat trophies this game makes my day. You can become [SPOILER ALERT]a flipping sperm whale and flop around the map or even an alien from Sanctum 2 (it kinda looks like a bug giraffe thing). There are many other goats you can be if you collect enough golden goat statues. This game even has workshop support, so if you get bored of the normal goats or the original map or even just want more abilities for custom games, then you can get an item from the workshop or make your own. For such a small map, the place is flipping packed with easter eggs (such as the golden goat trophies) and, my favorite, a cool robot dude in a storage crate held up by the crane and [SPOILER ALERT]If you get certain achievments you can actually be the robot!And on the side, there are many references to other games like Coffee Stain Studio's game Sanctum 2 and Flappy bird.CONS: The fact that they are only removing bugs that crash the game means that there will always be bugs. Always. Sometimes I find myself getting stuck on a rock and glitching underground. I still would like the bugs there but some of them are just plain irritating. The game also requires a pretty good graphics card, so make sure your computer isn't a potato and the game doesn't eat your computer. I had to turn my settings all the way down and only then did most of the lag go away. Another thing is that the Flappy Bird game (Flappy Goat) is the most rage inducing thing in the ENTIRE game. To unlock the achievment for the Flappy Goat you needed to score ten and my high score is like six. And the reason it is hard is because the hitbox of the goat is bigger than the goat itself so you end up hitting something when it looks like you didn't. And with some of the goats like the space goat for example, its a lot harder to know where your headbutting because you dont hit where your head goes, you hit right in front of you so it kinda seems a bit akward, but hopefully they will fix it. The game is still in development so all the bad stuff right now will probably be fixed in the future and new stuff will be added.Overall I give this game a 11/10. Apart from the bugs which they are never going to fix (which isn't really that bad) and some akward hitboxes this game is virtual gold. Mostly because the bad and irritating things about this game don't bother me as much as it would with other people. If you are looking for a good laugh, a goat with jelly legs, and a cool game to play with your friends at home(They are planning to add local co-op)then this is the game for you!**This game is Chuck Norris approved"

However the few levels it has are very small and it gets boring EXTREMELY fast.  This is caused by the only real goal in the game, to ""get more points"" or attempt to do a different stunt.  After hitting people or doing stuff to cars there is no consequences or reactions, they just reset and continue what they were doing.  The glitches are funny, but they are too common so it gets old fast.  You may be able to have more fun playing it with a friend, but I still don't think it will be long before you both move on to a different game.What would make the game better is if you start destroying stuff, and then the people ""around you"" (not everyone) start running after you.  A consequence.  The more you people you disturb, the more people run after you.  And if you are caught, you are sent to animal control or something where the level ends.  Which can end up in true chaos and panic as you try to get away and keep your points or try to still increase them.  But instead, the people just get up, the items just reset and everything continues on its robotic paths. No chaos, no consequence, no end, no truly fun goal.If a friend bought it already, play their copy, but I don't recommend buying it yourself.If you bought this hoping for a lot of fun or constant laughs, but disappointed like I was, I'm truly sorry.

To put it simply, it's a poorly featured game overhyped by the internet. Without DLC, there's a very limited assortment of things that you can actually do. What this game expects you to do is pay a few bucks for a part of the game that makes it playable, and then immediately asks you to go get their DLC to play more than just a measly few maps. This shouldn't be the case for a game that already has so little to do other than charge into people and stand on top of vehicles. Even when I got this for a discount price, I still found it ultimately wasteful of both time and money. The only way this game is ever ""fun"" is when you see someone else killing off their wallet for Twitch viewers.

It isn't really a game its just a simple sandbox that rather than having unlimited fun, it just kind of expires and you're left with nothing. I'd give cheers to the devs for getting new content out there, but the score system isn't enough to make it a game. No one bought goat simulator because they wanted to play it and get a high score, they bought it because they have nothing better to do and on account that the whole game is just a meme. Rather than making the whole game a joke being told over and over again, the developers should try to take an approach similar to Octodad, where the game had a STORY and there was a point of you being there, unlike Goat Simulator which doesn't really have an engaging goal or any story at all. Goat simulator's concept is alright, and it could work for sure, but the execution of it makes it bland and gives it a finite amount of entertainment. If the game was given a factor that made it feel a bit more like a game rather than just a limited sandbox then I might've given the game a positive rating. I realize I'm going to get hate for this practical look at this game based on my experience, and because when people read reviews they want everyone to have the exact same opinion. In conclusion, I rate Goat Simulator a 3/10, I think it just really needs a better pull factor than the score system and the ""memes""."

Ever since my gerbil's drug addiction, i have been searching for something to rebuild me and this is just it. The story is so deep and meaningful i found myself remembering moments from my childhood and reassessing past actions i have made like my arrest back in 98'. I started up this game and it ran butter smoothe and i could edit the options for optimal graphical settings. Okay enough bragging about my pc, lets get into the game. I was astonished at the transition from the menu to the game. It was as if the game spoke to me while it transformed from just another ""game with a menu"" to a PERFECT game with a menu. The grass moved with grace and the fences were plain brown. The first thing i did was jump over a stick so gracefully, a tear let out of my eye. After breaking the fence and blowing up a gas station i was inspired to go and sign up for an anger management course to stop beating my wife. Before this game it used to be me vs the world however, now the world and i work together to become one. I have simulated my goat life for around 3 or 4 hours but i am immersed. By not being able to die in this game, i have realized suicide is not the answer. If there were one word i would use to describe this game it would be inspirational. It has been so therapeutical being able to lick crowds of people and flying jetpacks at the same time. The community for this game is just astonishing. There is a whopping 15-20 mods on the workshop! thats more than even skyrim has. Some poeple may insult this game but they have obviously not experienced the work of art that IS Goat Simulator. The gameplay is better than fallout and far exceeds my very own expectations. It was so genius making ""lick"" E and ""use"" R. I mean, that is some real thinking right there. I can bring all the loose items near me into a ball AND lick them at the same time!!! i know this seems childish but i just love licking♥♥♥♥♥♥after discovering this game. Oh and the animation for licking is just perfect. Your tounge ACTUALLY BOUNCES!!! i know it sounds crazy but i swear this is real!! Also, the sounds are just what brings this work of art together. As i hear the hooves of the goat hit the ground i listen for the birds in the distance chirping and the hippies arguing to end♥♥♥♥♥♥♥shaped snacks. When i am doing something crazy like blowing up something, it sounds like i am just there. I can sort of feel the air coming from my screen and the flames and smoke look professional. It would be hard to explain but, thats why you're reading this getting your credit card ready to buy this masterpiece. If you do not like goat simulator, it' because you have not witnessed it first hand. When you actually have the mouse in your hand it is like a peaceful high. Your mind focuses on becoming a goat and your body adapts. At school, i find myself trying to ""baaa"" to impress my aqquaintances. Everyone supports my playing of this game and they often take pictures and videos of me performing my goat screams. People are claiming that there are bugs with this game but trust me, THERE ARE NO BUGS. THE GAME IS 150% PERFECT NO LIE. Currently i am sitting down listening to tupac and ""baaaaing"" the lyrics. I am so happy, i even told my parents that i found a love in life. She is this game but i havent told them yet. This game has changed my life so much and i have learned so much. Wether i am licking basketballs and blowing up cars with it or enjoying a peaceful game of flappy goat, i am always happy. This game is picture perfect and needs literally NO patches. If you buy it you will not regret this purchase. Definently my choice for Game Of The Year/Decade/Century/Milenium. If i had to rate this i would give it a 43/10 just because of it's inspiration on MY life and the many others who have played this. I love you all and please buy this game. $10 is a small price to pay for a great lifeley experience and i would definently pay $60 if i had to!!!"

Goat Simulator is the ulitmate ""What The ♥♥♥♥"" game, it's a mixture of random, solid, and enteraining pieces of the standard game formula. It fulfills everything a sandbox game needs(including custom map support), with the next update comes Parkour and Muitiplayer.

If you're looking for actual structured goals, Goat Sim has a few, but overall very little to offer in that regard. There are trophies hidden throughout the maps, some in clever spots. There are secret areas and tasks, some of which unlock things (other characters, jetpacks etc) which give you more ways to tackle stuff.But ultimately this game is just a stupid,♥♥♥♥♥♥around, ragdoll/physics simulator. If you're okay with having your IQ damaged, give it a whirl. It'll give you a few hours of fun. I happen to like screwing around and accomplishing nothing in games, and this entire game accomplishes nothing. It's a blast.Being drunk helps.Oh, but beware: certain things, like the Demon/Jesus goat and the softball launcher (which spawn game assets) will gradually slow the game down. There is NO garbage collector. Objects do NOT despawn. If you pick up/become something that creates objects, the game will start to perform worse and worse as time goes on.

It is very interesting how you can interact with almost everything and every place you visit has things to do inside and or outside of it, something that will certainly keep you busy for a while without realizing how much fun you are having playing a… goat simulator.For a game of its kind and the time it took to be completedit is very well-made and the graphics are better than you would expect them to be,keeping in mind other simulator games.The music is a very enjoyable part of it for me, too, as it really compliments the theme and you can definitely get in the mood of destroying everything you lick (or you do not) with it casually playing in the background (always paired with the cries of helpless civilians getting sacrificed for the sake of your existence, something thatof coursecannot be dismissed).There are three main areas you can visit(excluding the DLC), all with various,quite ridiculous achievementsto hunt for andlots of different easter eggsto find. Adding to that, the variety of goat mutators you are offered to unlock and choose from makes the game ten times better; is there really anywhere you can be adouble-jumping, party-starter devil goat with a jetpack andnotbe judged?One of the things that really sold me about Goat Simulator though is itsMMO feature(free DLC paired with the game). While loading, you see a log-in screen in the style of a real MMO and then you get the option to apply one of five classes mutators to start your adventure. After spawning, you come acrossa chatin the bottom left corner, with different players talking, asking questions or inviting you to join their guild. Except from how beautiful everything looks in that area, with the medieval feel and nature elements being really strong,thatis what impressed me the most as the chat is apparentlysimulated too,so greatly made that it has confused many people, including me, of the existence of other players.If you feel like you want to play a gamepurely for fun,messing around in an open world, being a goat,then you would definitely enjoy Goat Simulator.It might not be a game everyone would enjoy as it may seem repetitive or fun for a small period of time, but I had a blast going through it, and even more together with the DLC (which I have to add, one is more detailed than the other, you can lose yourself for hours in front of the screen). Definitelynotyour ordinary simulator, but surely amust-try for simulator lovers.My reviews on the Goat Simulator DLC;• Review for“Goat Simulator: GoatZ”can be readhere.• Review for“Goat Simulator: PAYDAY”can be readhere.• Review for“Goat Simulator: Waste of Space”can be readhere."

I understand it's hard to get so much success on a big gaming trend like goat simulation but this goat simulator was by far the best. I licked a car into a fence. It exploded. The game mechanics are amazingly complex, this is next generation stuff right here. If you're a fan of hilarious comedy, then go away. This is a game to be taken deadly serious. It's all about the way of life and how to goat properly. Let's face it, we've all tried to goat at one point. Most of us fail, so this simulation game is perfect for those that are currently unable to goat correctly. This game teaches you the full goat etiquette, law and physics. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone over the age of 22 and under the age of 23. I hope you learned something from this review."

But in the time I have played this, I have found a few glitches that have halted my play, made me get stuck in walls, and fly around like a ♥♥♥♥ing bird. Let me list my experiences to you.I headbutted a human and they flailed like a ♥♥♥♥ing bird human.A human walked into me, i flew into a gas station, and flew sideways out of the map.I jumped from a crane, hit a wall, and became one with the wall.I walked against a wall and my head had a ♥♥♥♥ing sizure.I touched a firework, as expected, i flew up into the air and exploded. Upon exploading, my goat flew up into the sky, and began to spin, as he spun, nothing was happening. Then began to fall. As i watched Sr. Goat fall for 2 minutes, I expected him to hit the ground and bounce. This was not even close to what happened, Sr. Goat hit the ground and got his head stuck into the sidewalk as his body flew away bouncing like he should have.I got the jetpack. I was so excited, but then i hit a trampoline and flew out of the map, crashing my pc.I touched a tredmeal, upon toucing it though, i was not thrown backwards, instead, i was thrown into the roof with my body dangaling from my head, which had been shoved into the roof at the speed of light.This is just the start of the glitches, although if i had put them all, it would be longer than all of the reviews together. Then again, your a ♥♥♥♥ing goat, and no other game will make you laugh this much. It is so enjoyably stupid that the 10 dollar price tag does not do this game right. You must have this game, you need this game.Also, you can play as a robot, hit the roof of a car with your fist (wich is for some reason called headbutting anyways) and fly to space.10/10 would headbutt again"

Though there are minor aspects of realism sacrificed for the sake of playability, namely the third-person (third-goat?) view, the game as a whole pays stunning attention to the finer details of daily goat life.  The controls are slick and intuitive, making licking, bleating, and headbutting a straightforward matter.  Of course skill will allow you to perform more complex goat actions such as mid-air flips and other such acrobatics for which the graceful goat is so well known.  However, it is my opinion that the game's brilliance is most evident in the masterfully wrought storyline.  You begin the game as a young goat living in a peaceful neighborhood, but destiny calls you from beyond the low-lying fence of your grassy yard. From the game's outset, you have control of the story.  In true RPG fashion, you are allowed to explore the massive open-world sandbox and forge your own legacy.  Will you follow in the footsteps of the great Michael Bay?  Will you become a notorious outlaw?  Perhaps explore the upper reaches of the stratosphere for the good of goat-kind?  Will your ambitions lead you to the arena to defeat your enemies in single combat?  Maybe you will become one with the darkness and serve the Blood Goat.  Or perhaps you shall rise to prominence and power as the lord of all goats: The Goat King.  The possibilities are endless.  If you are one of the many people around the world who has yearned for a realistic and satisfying goat experience, then this game may just be the very thing that brings peace to your soul.  10/10"

The staff, disheartened but defiant, did what had to be done in order to release this simulation in it's place.They managed to pull off a substantial rewrite and upgrade on what was originally going to be just another quick-to-the-bargain-bin cookie-cutter FPS game, though with one unique twist: the alien invaders were hyper-advanced genetically engineered goats. The backstory was that their ancestors seeded this planet with goats millions of years ago in a futile attempt to supplant the human race. Now they've come back to finish the job and... well, history majors should know the rest (humanity prevails over alternate-future Nazi zombie goats).So if you want to try your hand at a game that started out as something very, very different, then buy Goat Simulator today. The goat-like alien monitoring your CIA brain implant will thank you for it."

It's also not like the really well thought out simulators, like Bus Simulator or such.It's hard to really describe Goat simulator.  You're a goat, you run around and do anything you want.  You have bad animation, but you rarely look at the goat itself.  There's even a skate board ramp at one point, only thing is you don't ""Skate"" you just ragdoll your body and throw it around, and yet it works.I don't know if I'd heavily recommend this game, because it feels unpolished at almost any angle, the animation of the goat is weak, and the ""game"" is... well I don't know if there's really a game.But it's still wicked fun to go run around the level and act like an animal.If you have a couple guys over and want to just have a blast, the local co-op actually works quite well.

This is a major disapointment as I was quite exited about being a tree and other types of plants (Yes I am a shrubery). The trailers led on that the trees are the characters and they fight for equality of trees as building materials (hence the wood houses V. concrete buildings). Also the goat will at times eat grass. This is very offensive occording to some of my grass friends who also own this game. I also believe this game is supporting bad behavior in motor transportation devices and teaching them to advance at unsafe speeds.

What makes Goat Simulator fun is it's gameplay, it requires you to play as a goat and cause alot of chaos as possible. And what makes it even more fun to cause more chaos in the game is the many mutators you can add to the goat such as, a jetpack that goes basically everywhere, devil goat which you can ball objects and people up in a demented Katamari Damacy style, the power pitcher which allows you to shoot baseballs at people, and my personal favorite deadgoa7 which you can play music and have people around you dance. This game has many endless possibilities on what to do and that is what makes it fun. I also love this games humor and I think this game is best at that.

,Recommended,265930,9950540,"Posted: 27 April, 2014",all,Blind,"Never did I think I would be able to simulate the life of a goat.  However, this game goes beyond simply head-butting people into cars causing them to explode, jumping on trampolines, flying around on a jetpack, and using your Devil-goat powers to summon goat spawn.These are all things you can do in Goat Simulator, but it is much more than that.  In the world of Goat Simulator, you are simply a goat.  You can vicariously living out life through this goat.  This goat is who I strive to be.  This goat goes beyond what man can comprehend as simply being care-free or content.  This goat is a way of life.To fully illustrate my point in saying ""Goat is love, goat is life"", I will have to go beyond simply reviewing the game and share a slice of my own life with you.  Every day I wake up in the morning and think to myself ""How can I live my life like that goat's today?"".  I, like everyone, have certain responsibilities and obligations to attend to regularly, but these things are things we have to do, correct?  Well the goat thinks otherwise.  Goat does not know silly things such as doing taxes, going to work, and showering.  Goat does not need money.  Goat needs nothing but his own will to be free and joyously frolick through fields of wheat and simply be.  The goat exists, therefore he is content.Some of you may think I am joking, but all of what I have said is true and from the heart.  Next time you feel down on life, upset you didn't get your dream job and aren't making as much money as you'd like to, haven't met a person to settle down with, or mad at the government for ridiculous laws, think ""What would goat do?"".  Goat would sprint of into the wilderness and eat a bunch of psilocybin mushrooms.  Goat does what he wants, and wants what he does.  Remember, Goat is love, Goat is life."

But I was warned and the concept and marketing alone made me take the risk. It would bring me joy to know the developers got wealthy of this game to be honest though. We need more out of the box creativity. For 2.50 or a free halflife mod, is more the present value in my opinion.The game play is smooth, but the goat moves side to side like a chess piece instead of a 3D action hero, while running forward like one.The scope is limited. For me it was a quick burst of expectation met by a sudden realization of the limited scope and disappointment presented.The best I can say is, you can jump, go limp (ragdoll), headbutt anything destructible, on a small map, where the people and objects regenerate. Its like being allowed to do a bit of something you aren't usually allowed to do, then not wanting to do it when you realize that is all you can do. It loses its fun. That said, I think its on the right path and eventually the developers will find that perfect touch."

At the bottom of the building the lift opens and let's something in.  About ten seconds later the lift opens at the top of the building and let's something out.  Who is it.  What is it.  Ah, it must be another partygoer arriving.  Actually, no.  It's a goat.  Your the goat.  It causes complete chaos head butting people smashing up the bar and jumping around like a maniac.  After causing even more damage to the party the goat jumps on to a powerful fan and it flies away to another place.  What's it going to do there.  Cause even more chaos.  Oh, you don't say!  Two minutes after the party was crashed by the goat, the partygoers notice a house with couches, tables and other strange objects flying out of the windows.  They also hear a strange baaing sound from inside the house.  It's the goat again.Goat Simulator is a great game.  There is really no aim to it apart from the explore the open world and to cause complete chaos.  There are eighty eight fun Steam achievements to unlock.  The achievements can go from dropping a massive boulder on a car that is zooming around a small dirt circuit to climbing a small tower that turns out to be the goat tower where there are many goats and they consider you royalty.  My favourite one is when a UFO comes and takes you into space.  Sorry for the spoilers but it was necessary to show off the awesomeness of Goat Simulator.  Don't worry I only mentioned three of the eighty eight achievements available.I completely recommend this game and I also recommend the three DLCs available.  For example the Goat Simulator: GoatZ DLC is amazing.  It has two new maps with a zombie survival mode and includes many extra things that your goat can do such as turning humans into zombies and making weapons out of things that are lying around.  Like a machine that shoots gum balls like a shot gun and causes the zombies to become multicoloured with the gum ball splat.  The Goat MMO Simulator is free and is great fun to play with friends.  The last DLC is the soundtrack and it is a bit weird to listen to but it's still cool.  I would rate it 89/100 because of it's awesomeness however it would be cool if the citizens would be more scared of you when you destroy their stuff.  So what are you waiting for?  Buy the game, strap yourself in and go for it.  Wait, did I say strap yourself in?  Yes I did.  You might need to as one of the goats has a jet pack.  Anyway, destroy everything in your path and cause chaos everywhere you go by head butting everything and everybody in sight."

There's tons of secrets lying about the world as well as different skins for your goat to unlock. Integration with the steam workshop virtually guarantees that maps, goat mutations and skins will be coming out long after the developers move on to another project.However, the price can be a bit much for those looking for a laugh, and if you want a deep gameplay experience with a story and characters look elsewhere. This is exactly what it looks like, a joke game, but that's not to say it isn't fun or worth your time. If you take the time to get all the achievements, collectables and goats (without looking up guides) then you're in for a good 6+ hour experience with Goat Simulator. After that it can get a bit dull as you've done everything, hopefully the developers don't totally leave the game to modders and put out more content in the future.Bottom line, if you can spare 10 bucks on a joke game, want to have a good laugh and are looking for a fun game to spend a few hours on Goat Simulator is a good choice."

Sadly after 7 hours, all the quests were completed and all the achievements unlocked. After that, the game kind of loses its appeal. Some multiplayer will definitely save it and make one put in more hours. Graphics is good, sound is fun, glitches add to the theme, controls are okay. Obviously there is no story (not an issue in this case) and only a few quests. Once those quests are complete, you have the whole Goat Simulator world to cause chaos... which is sadly a very small world. Still a good and enjoyable game though."

Most of these Simulator games are unfinished, poorly made or a kickstarter project for fast money without a real made project. They are the flavour of the month, coming after all of the survival games. In Goat Simulator you play as a goat with poorly made animations, which I assume to be part of the humour. You destroy things such as, boxes, cars and furniture. There are various challenges to be completed and the map is large and has many events to see and interact with. You receive points by destroying the enviroment in unique ways and doing tricks, such as flips, spins and more.4/10"

Much to discover.Sure, it does not really seem to run (performance-)efficiently, and the silly physics in conjunction with the level (boundaries/collision-detection) is not perfect; but getting stuck in  something etc is fun in itself in such a silly and fun atmosphere, so I can easily forgive that./Update:After the huge MMO Simulator update, I have to state a big thank you!

I have enjoyed playing it and it is fun to play when your friends come over as you can share in a few laughs. After a while though the novelty sort of wore off and it was not as funny as when I got it. I also found it more enjoyable with friends than on my own. I feel that if you play it too much for too long the glitches lose their comedic aspect.Overall I would reccommend this game because I found it entertaining and funny at the begining, however I would stress that it became a bit boring to me after a while.

Graphics are smooth and the game play is fun, though if you don't like free world exploration it won't be fun. However, if you're looking at this game in the first place you must be interested in running around as a goat and running a muck. The learning curve for moving and such is small, so having fun running around and smashing things up gets easy. However, that doesn't mean it gets old.

Hands down, easily the BEST goat-centric game I have EVER played in my entire life....All that being said, it REALLY is a lot of fun, but don't go into this thinking it is a full-fledged AAA game, or even a AA game. In fact, I don't know if I would even really call this a game, per se. It's more like a really fun distraction than a game. I heartily recommend this, BUT, please be fully aware of what you are getting. You are paying ten bucks for a fairly short, one stage distraction. While it is HELLA fun, it can grow old fairly quick. It's great when you have a couple minutes to kill, and want to have some fun, but can't commit yourself to getting into a game.As it stands now you get maybe a solid two or three hours of gameplay, after which you are only playing for the fun of being an out of control goat in a suburban neighborhood, and wreaking total havoc. It does have Workshop support, so there are already new stages and stuff available, and hopefully the developer will continue to add new levels and stuff, but I'm not holding my breath."

Mothers will often call to their young (kids) to ensure they stay close-by. Mother and kid goats recognise each other's calls soon after the mothers give birth.Kids can follow their mothers almost immediately after being born. They are very close to their mothers and are weaned after around 6 months.Goats are very intelligent and curious animals. Their inquisitive nature is exemplified in their constant desire to explore and investigate anything unfamiliar which they come across.Goats have excellent coordination. They have great balance and are thus able to survive in precarious areas such as steep mountains. They can even climb trees and some species can jump over 5 feet high."

Go play a game like Logistics SImulator. That game is so bad it made me want to toss my lunch into my own mouth. And it isn't a joke. The physics are a mess. And there are dozens of ""simulator"" programs just like it. Euro Truck Simulator is the exception that possibly created this movement to simulate seemingly boring things. I love that game because it was made with extreme care, while the genre it spawned is filled with shovelware of the worst variety.When you start ""playing"" this ""game"" you will notice that the physics are completely nuts. You couldn't get them this bad without an actual effort. See? It is all intentional. Keep playing, and you start to see that the developers actually did put a ton of content in here. There is a lot to do and see, easter eggs around every corner. The devs are not lazy nor stupid, they are pranksters.So while I cannot recommend this ""game"" I definitly recommend this ""joke."" If you are looking at the price, sure, thats a concern if you are on a limited gaming budget...go buy something else for gameplay. But if you are sick of shovelware and want to revel in a game poking a stick in their eye, BUY THIS JOKE!I am keeping this as a non-recommendation so that all the cranks in here see it.

And that it's great.Basically, you're a goat, and you go around causing mayhem. So you see how much mayhem you can cause, get points for doing so, and a series of ridiculous events can occur. The newest patch, with MMO simulator (ie a simulated MMO, I guess people were actually expecting full MMO support in a free patch for their novelty simulator game) adds new levels of ridiculousness, with classes and more hijinx.Definitely a good pickup on sale. You'll get a few hours of grand fun with it, if you are a light-hearted person with a love of ridiculousness. I know I am."

Something about jumping on a trampoline and soaring threw the skies with your tongue flapping in your ear really got to me, and now I just can't put it down!You would think that since I am playing a single-player game, I wouldn't make any friends or maybe meet a nice man who would want to take me out on a nice date and bring me flowers, yet I made many, and yes, Molle and I are very happy. A day in the world of a goat may consist of eating humans by the water, fighting against fellow goats, and spending the night hosting a Deadgoa7 party at the top of a fancy hotel. We goats take YOLO to the next level. Since we ya know, never die.Hahahaha-baaaaa-ahaha. Oh sorry, my mother was a sheep… I may have picked up a few notes.Who knew that a simple game would make me so heartbroken whenever I got called an alpaca instead of a goat! Well, all these humans must die, so why not summon the devil to come and kill them! It's so simple! They will pay for calling me an alpaca!

Whether you like it or not depends on what kind of games you like. If you love hilarious and silly game themes, and don't mind lots of bugs (some of which are also hilarious) this is definitely the game for you. If you're more focused on plots, characters, and more serious stuff, and you want a game to be bug free and smooth to play, it might not appeal to you. The basic concept of the game, as you probably already know, is that you are a goat (or a whale, ostrich, penguin, giraffe e.t.c.) and you mess everything up, or if you want to play MMO Simulator, you do that AND play an MMO simulation at the same time. Pretty cool combination in my opinion! It's really fun to try and get all the achievements for this game, and also just to let your anger out on any of the NPCs that are disgusted by your presence.  I would recommend this game to most people because of the surprising amount of hours of fun you can get from it, and also because of all the different ways you can play using different animals and different mutations."

It's a harder game to play than it seems to be though. To get maximum fun and comedy you actually have to be pretty good at the game to navigate your ""tricks"" correctly. That's easier said than done because these controls are kinda wonky. I would best describe the gameplay as similar to when you're goofing around in a Tony Hawk game trying to see what kind of silly or outrageous things you can do. It also reminds me of the Saints Row insurance fraud side missions with the ragdoll physics and destruction intention. In fact it's almost exactly like that... except..... goat. So I would say play Saints Row instead and go straight to the insurance fraud, toss yourself around and laugh, laugh, laugh if that's your thing.

It literally took me about 5 hours to get really bored of the game. And that is getting the feeling that you can no longer 'milk' the fun out of it any more.Aside from exploring the surprisingly small map, the player is still able to interact with a small amount of Easter eggs scattered around the map (I'll not spoil of course).And as i almost forgot to mention, there are a few achievements and quests in this game, and it can be pretty fun if you try to complete them all.Hopefully, the developers will add in more content in the near-future, as otherwise counting on Steam Workshop won't bring much longevity to the game.Final Verdict: 4/10 , probably the weirdest game of the year with some form of hilarity."

It is a physics / ragdoll simulator, the 'game' consists of the player freely exploring, finding easter eggs and completing challenges.It honestly feels like the game is a world with hundreds of assets thrown in randomly.  If you touch just about anything in the game, it explodes or freaks out as if it is a rubber band you have just released.  You can touch a fence and it will explode into planks that will shoot off in random directions.  You can watch the civilians and you'll see their walking / running, they don't care what's around them or in front of them, they'll walk forward into an object and crumble to the ground from touching it with their limbs flipping in all sorts of directions.  It loses it's enjoyment very quickly.The goat controls like a mass on ice, you move the controls slightly and you'll glide for a metre, you land at an odd angle and your body will freak out.  I've on many occasions landed from a large fall and had my goat stick into the groud, and get stuck unable to do anything but respawn.  There are some achievements and challenges where you have to collect small objects and take them somewhere, it you nudge the object 'slightly' it will shoot off into the distance or it can fall into the ground and be lost.For what it is it does it well, it's a game that you pick up for 10 minutes, goof around and then put down.  Or you make videos to show others, the game has no substance.  I played for an hour and a half and maybe smiled once, the rest of the time I was being annoyed by objects blocking my path, things being lost and trying to complete irritating achievements.  I've managed to do all but 1 achievement on the first stage (Flappy Goat), most of the achievements are gimmicks or references, which this game relies on heavily, everything is a reference or homage to something else.Get this game for $2 to try out with a group of friends, but don't set your expectations high."

I looked down at my keyboard where two hooves clumsily fumbled with the keys in a vain attempt to save the virtual representation of my onset mutation from exiting the skybox. It was too late. Once the goat vanished from my sight, a strange feeling washed over me. Fur. Fur was growing everywhere, with no end in sight. There was fur in places I thought impossible to be able to grow any. A sharp pain erupted from my shin as the bones within my lower leg snapped in half and transformed shape. My right leg was now bent entirely backwards, coated in fur. The excruciating process was repeated for my left leg as I felt my face elongate; coarse fur had grown here as well. My tongue swelled in my throat until I was unable to contain it behind my clenched teeth. My tongue flopped freely, like I was a panting dog; but by this point you probably know damn well that I was no dog. I too came to realize my fate; when my ears drooped, my tail formed, and horns sprouted from my skull, everything was clear. It was finally over when my neck grew out further from my stocky, quadrapedal body. Throughout my transformation I had resisted the urge to cry out for help, I had to stay strong in the face of my destiny. But now...now I had to know. Had this really happened? Could it be true? I swallowed to moisten my vocal chords as I opened my mouth to speak, ""BAA-AA-AA!""

And let me tell you why.There are plenty of positive reviews that tell us about what the funny and entertaining Goat Simulator is, that this is a masterpiece and all. Yes, this is funny and entertaining game, but the thing is it would bore you after spending 2-3 hours playing it. Even with all DLC it would bore you. If you search an entertaining game to spend a lotta time in it, I won't advise you to buy it. But if you want just to horse around a couple of hours, please do."

The controls are simple and easy to learn, and the graphics are fine as well. The soundtrack is quite fitting, and its wonkiness really adds to the humor of the game.You play as an immortal, chaos-seeking goat who would love nothing more than to see the entire map explode a thousand times over. To start off, you are placed in Goatville, a small town full of people ready to get headbutted and cars ready to get blown up. Be it the houses, trampolines, waterslides, dirt rally, or anti-gravity facility, it's quite an interesting start. Throughout the map are a number of hidden trophies, often placed in inconvenient locations in order to encourage you to fully explore your surroundings. By completing certain tasks around the map, you can gain access to several different kinds of goats, further enhancing your abilities.If you tire of the starter area, the coastal Goat City map is next on your list. Its inhabitants are similar to those in Goatville, oblivious to you until you begin rampaging through their homes, destroying everything in sight to boost that high score in the corner. Just like in Goatville, there are a number of secrets hidden around this map. Furthermore, the game gives you free access to an ""MMO,"" which isn't really online, but it's good fun all the same. Full of NPCs and side quests, it's sure to interest you for a while.While I haven't played them personally, the game also offers a number of DLCs, letting you experience zombie survival, bank robbing, and space exploration all through the lens of a psychopathic goat. Admittedly, the game does lose its charm after a couple hours, but those couple of hours are hilariously fun, and I've found that it's a fun game to return to for a short while when you're bored. Overall, great casual game, best played in short bursts now and again. I'd recommend giving it a shot, especially if you can catch it on sale."

,Not Recommended,265930,9717899,"Posted: 3 April, 2014",all,sabar,"When I first heard of Goat Simulator, I immediately knew my life was complete.  All these years I have yearned for an accurate simulation of thecapra aegagrus hircusspecies.  With glee, I rushed home from work and purchased Goat Simulator.It looks like my search for an accuratecapra aegagrus hircussimulator will continue.This simulation plays suspiciously like a ""video game"" and nothing like a sim.  The physics are far off from reality.  Your goat will be sent airborne at the slightest touch and crumples in a heap constantly.  This is clearly not a ""fainting goat"", so why does it keep falling down? The physical skill of the player-goat is greatly exaggerated, with your goat able to head-butt objects weighing thousands of kilograms and send them flying.  The weak spine of a goat could also never support the weight of a jetpack.The poor simulation does not stop with the goat however.  The humans in the simulation are unusually elastic and die if there is the slightest breeze. There is no day/night cycle or weather.  The laws of physics clearly do not exist as my player-goat has been caught inside of objects many times.  Have the developers never heard of Wolfgang Pauli and his exclusion principle?  The quantum mechanics in this game are all wrong!Although the particle physics simulation portion can be forgiven, many essential aspects of goat-dom simulation are missing in their entirety.  There is no option to choose between a buck or a doe goat.  The breed of goat is not selectable either.  There is no goat mating whatsoever and somehow, despite the abundance of random trash, you can't eat anything.  The player-goat seems to be immortal and needs no sleep.  Goat milking and butchering is totally absent, though the player-goat is capable of committing genocide against all humans.Even the basics of a goat are wrong.  The tongue of the player-goat is particularly disturbing in its inaccuracy.  It is far too long and elastic, with a bizarre tendency to stick to objects.  Even someone new to goat enthusiasm knows that this is not the case.  A goat tongue has an average extended length of 22.4 cm and a friction coefficient of 0.2, but these limits are clearly violated over and over.In the end, I cannot recommend this game at all, as it is a woefully inaccurate goat simulation.  I am glad that more people are aware ofcapra aegagrus hircussimulators in general, but like the many that have preceded this one, it is just a cheap cash-grab trying to dupe goat enthusiasts.  Consider me duped, but my search goes on.NOTE: I am currently testing whether or not the goat life expectency is accurately coded, but this is hard to test as there is no in-game clock.  I can only assume it runs in sync with real time.  I hope to update this review in 20 years with results."

He's a popular fiction writer attempting to escape the pressures of fame and creative expectation whose vacation in Bright Falls quickly turns Twin Peaks weird. His wife goes missing, and his search to find her is swiftly diverted into the realm of the paranormal, forcing him to pick up a gun and pull the trigger to stay alive. It's an adventure heavily informed by television shows like X-Files and Twilight Zone and horror fiction from Stephen King and H.P. Lovecraft. Presentation, character building, and plot twists take on just as big a role as the tightly wound action gameplay you'd expect from a Remedy title. The result is a swirling tale of fiction that's endearingly self-aware, that occasionally sputters and stumbles, but offers enough scares, laughs, and thrills to keep you hooked."" - IGN"

I haven't played Goat MMO Simulator to speak of and haven't got the newly popular GoatZ DLC but the original two maps are amazing. The achievements to this game are a challenge, but not too hard to get and are really good. A little bit buggy gameplay but that is honestly part of this game's charm and doesn't cause too many serious problems, just funny situations. The best part of the game is the different types of goats for certain purposes (e.g. Double jump goat, Angel goat [flies] or Queen goat [summons ragdoll goats]) and the way the player can combine them.Really good and downright funny game, 9.5/10. Great mess around game.EDIT : I have now easily fixed the game and have played Goat MMO Simulator. It's a great map until you get all the achievements and complete all the quests, then the regular maps are better. The magician class is so much fun, you can shoot fireballs and in tightly packed spaces these are great for points / XP. Overall Goat MMO Simulator is a good addition for a few hours of enjoyment and I'm looking forward to playing GoatZ."

You get to be a goat.2. There are lots of trophies and secret areas and lots of achivements.3. You can lick people. You can lick chairs. Ever wondered what a grill tastes like? Now you know.4. You get to be a goat.CONS:1. Limited space. I want to explore more! What's beyond the sea blue and the islands? I see mountians. I want someone to take me on a majestic sail boat to explore.2. Laggy on non-gaming computers. This is mostly my computer. It's a good computer for doing easy work, but not for a realistic game like Goat Sim. I wish I could afford a gaming computer. Maybe one day. Turning the settings down helps a little bit.3. Replayability. I want to play this more, but to me it feels like headbutt, jump, lick this, collect that, go to next place. I know there are extra features, but again with the lag.4. Price. I got this during a Steam Summer Sale, so it was the low price of 2-5$, but I can't fathom paying 10$ for this. Now, a price like 3-5$ would pull in a lot more people.My final rating for this game is a 7.6/10."

There is, now, a Goat MMO version added to the game, (which has been out for a while, by the way). And, yeah, there are many achivments in the game.Goat Sim is great for just screwing around. You can mess with the NPC's, (like Skyrim), sacrifice NPC's to the Demon Goat, or just go full out ""completionist"", and get all 106 achivments. Yes, 88. Some are easy to get, others are difficult, and others require the newly added DLC, Goat Z, (PLease, don't look that up on the internet. You have been warned....). Throughout the game, you unlock different goats by doing different things. For example: scarificing 5 NPC's will get you the demon goat. Each goat does a different thing. And you can combine goat powers. Also, there are different maps you can play on, which are Goatville, Goat City Bay. GoatMMO, and Goat Z. Goat Z is a zombie survival DLC mode, where you, the goat, are the zombie. Your goal is to infect everyone else, and start the zombie apcolypse. Then, try to survive it. You need to eat and craft weapons to survive. In the PAYDAY DLC, you get 4 different characters, each one having their own special ablity. You go around and do ""pranks"" to get money to buy more masks. The map is LARGE, and there are a lot of things to do, besides just pranks. Both of these DLC add new achivements to get.Now, let's talk about the Goat MMO, (I have a feeling that this is gonna be the longest review that I have writen so far). The GoatMMO let's you talk to other players. Now, from my exprince with the MMO, the other players are put at, I think, random spots, and cycle through a certain movement pattern. I don't think you can interact with other online players, except through chat. But, that's just what I think, from expirnce. In the MMO, everytime you: Headbutt something, lick something, sucessfully land a flip, sucessfully do a wall run, and finish missions, (which I will get to in a minute), will get you EXP to level up. The higher the level, the better your charcter is? I don't know, I don't pay attention. Now, missions. You get missions, just like in any other MMO, or RPG, from talking/interacting with NPC's. These get you EXP, enabling you to level up, and letting you do something.So, there you have it. Goat Simulator. This game does make some dirty jokes every now and then, and curses every now and then. But, overall, this is an 100%, 10 outa 10, IGN approved, fantasic game. Coffee Stain Studios, you have made another great game. keep up the good work. I recommend this to everybody. Again, keep up the brilliant work, Coffee Stain Studios."

How do you split water? I have no idea what they're saying but okay!!! Also, how did Moses not die if he was left in a basket going along the nile river, aren't there crocodiles there? or were they taking a little break.Chapter 3: The ARK, it's a space colony in Sonic Adventure 2. Sonic and his friends go there, is the bearded man called Noah actually Dr Eggman???? woaaaah.Chapter 4: Jesus Christ, he was born... like any other human being. So, doesn't matter what religion you are, Mary is still a virgin. So in Christianity there's Joseph Stalin, yet he doesn't ♥♥♥♥ her? okay... in Islam there's nobody and God just made her pregnant, that would make more sense but no, I'm reviewing the Bible! anyways, I can't believe Mary didn't go out and just suck someone off.Chapter 5: Jesus is nailed to a cross, ouchie. Why would you do that to someone? what did he ever do to you. Also Judas sounds like a nice fruit juice company.So anyways, I think the Bible is quite good and I think you should give it a tryI just realised I'm supposed to be reviewing Goat Simulator... whoops."

I rate this game 4/10 because also there was not much to do on it and it has a lot of bugs. So if  u like games with goats then get this game because u get to play as them but if not then do not get this because it might not be for u. Even though u do get to use jet packs and stuff like that u can not do that for a long time and still have fun. I hope this helped.

The physics are insanely entertaining, and the amount of secrets and achievements to hunt down is daunting.  Finally, there is a lot of community-created content easily available to enhance the game thanks to the Steam Workshop integration.Performance issues.This game is pretty fun, but it requires a pretty powerful computer to run smoothly.  I could not find any graphics options to turn down the visual effects, and the framerate lowers to about 1FPS when you explore the busy areas or blow things sky high.  I also noticed some models were simple-looking yet wanted to slow the game down for some odd reason.  I assume the models have a lot of unnecessary topology.  Some sound effects also seemed to require a brief 3-second hiccup, which was very annoying when I picked up each goat trophy.CoOp/VS is missing features.Races do not have finish lines and only one checkpoint ever shows up.  The race mode adds an annoying rider to your back that you cannot remove unless you restart the map.  There should be a way to cancel the race mode but there does not seem to be such an option.Overall opinion:  This game is fun, but you should wait and get it on sale."

You watched the viral video, you laughed, you waited until the game launched, you paid your $10 and laughed at it for 20 mins before quitting and leaving it to collect dust in your library. Like everything else that goes viral on YouTube. I mean, what happened to Rebecca Black? You probably don't even remember who she is.Therefore, there would be no point for me to review Goat Simulator as a game, or a simulator for that matter, because it was never really intended for that purpose. If I were to somehow be able to shut off the laugh factor in my head, and give a Stephen Hawking review of the game, it would look like this:Verdict:- Millions of bugs- Poorly made- No objective- Horrendous physics- Amateurish- Waste of money and time0.5/10HOWEVER, as this is a serious review of Goat Simulator as a piece of pointless junk, I'm going to overlook the (harsh) facts and change the name of the game to something more appropriate.#swagyoloGoatThere.Now, the main point of #swagyoloGoat is to be a really annoying #div to everyone in town. The map is very small, but the developers have released details of a new map to be added in May, along with multiplayer. God knows how the latter works.The game is alluringly moddable; you can also unlock Goat upgrades as you find little golden #swagyoloGoat statues around the town.You get points for absoultely everything, from licking tables to being shot into outer space dressed as a demon, due to one of the game's million bugs kept in because they are all apparently hilarious. Of course, there is no objective, other than to unlock all the game's goats and trash the possessions of people, including their own spleen, around town. The sheer fun factor though is #insane. The amount of things you have never said before will mostly be said while playing #swagyoloGoat, believe me! You can do practically anything, and try jumping using trampolines and matresses to access almost anywhere. The funny thing is it is easy to jump to places you think it wouldn't be, which gives you a goaty confidence boost. There isn't much left to say about this 'game' other than enjoy all the random funny surprises it has to offer. Get it, it is an expensive laugh at £7, but it is also a damn good one. There is even an explicit content filter... So your children can play too... If you're that #wastedVerdict:- Paragliding: 10/10- Dragging people into Low Gravity Testing Facilities: 10/10- Real resemblance to real-life Goatsteering: 1/10- ""It's because goats do that!"": 9/10- I bought some goat's cheese today: 10/10- Tightrope walking Ostriches: 1000/10- I'm off to play #swagyoloGoat again: 0/10Overall: okifffffffffrtimwuiheryhb fu rhtjeopmobirrmtpori rjuw pr g,uwr /10Happy Goatsteering"

I needed to experience my life as a goat. Goat Simulator has filled the void in my life.I knew as soon as I hit the truck with my goat that this was what I had been missing. I flew through the air in slow motion, tongue flying around, hitting the edge of the map and rebounding back, landing on (and falling through) the roof of a house. I could not get out, but that did not matter. I was treated with the ability to look down into the house beneath me, seeing the unsuspecting people casually sitting at their computers, oblivious to the sheer terror of the goat above them.Whether it was playing football with a basketball, swinging lampposts into groups of people or even doing 1080 degree flips, there was no limit to life as a goat. I didn't think it could get any better than this.I was wrong.As I jumped and screamed my way around the map, leaving a path of destruction in my wake, I happened upon a golden statue. Curiosity overtook me and I resisted the urge to grab it no longer. My life as a goat changed completely. I had a jetpack.I knew that this was meant to be, and what my mission from the Great Coffee Stain in the sky was. I was granted the supergoat power of being able to lift people and cars with my tongue. I could survive any impact. I could slow down time with mere thought. Now I could fly. It was time for world domination. Humanity had to be silenced so that the new goat overlords could reign supreme.All the humans are dead or enslaved. I have won. I am the goat, the goat is me.Go and goat this game. I kid you not, for mere bucks you can experience a sandbox like no other. Destruction, mayhem, death defying stunts. Seriously, there are more than 921 million goats in the world. Killing the humans was just part of the game. This is a SIMULATOR. Do you understand? A SIMULATOR. This can happen. There are enough goats out there to enslave us and/or kill us.It is your duty as a human to get this game, so that you may truly know your enemy. An enemy people do not take seriously, an enemy that we know nothing about. Coffee Stain studios have granted us the insight into the true terrifying reality of the impending Goatpocalypse. This is your weapon against the goats. Be prepared, for the goats are coming to get us."

,Recommended,265930,14658317,"Posted: 25 February, 2015",all,Jaded Gamer,"Goat Simulator's main fun is also its downfall.Great fun can be had in just strolling around creating havoc anywhere you go in this open sandbax type of game. No one is there telling you that you cant do this or that you just set out with jet pack strapped on into the wide world and lick and headbut everything you come across.I had a few hours of fun just seeing what I can do and what the limits are and the first tick against the game arose in the form of unseen walls . Certain areas you will go have them in head scratching areas with no indication that you will run into one and this can create some confusion as you could be flying through the air on your jet pack one moment then struggling to wrestle the camera so that you can see when it gets completely folded in upon itself because you hit an unseen wall and crumpled to its base in a garbled mess.Head butting people and objects and watching them sail through the air is great fun and the easter eggs hidden throughout the game world are amazing and unexpected .This game does not take itself or the world seriously and that is a great ... great ... thing.The greatness of this game is that it allows you to do what you want with goals and secrets strewn about the landscape for you to find . The problem arises though in the form of the actual lack of hand holding to a fault .While playing this game you will see missions in the upper right corner of the screen tasking you with one thing or another and its your civic duty to go about these tasks with aplomb . The problem though is that there is zero direction as to what one should do to complete these and although discovering them on my own was decent fun i found some of these missions deliberately vague and kind of cryptic . One such task was to sacrifice something for some reason . I looked everywhere for this and to this writing have still not discovered what it was talking about or refering to.Graphical glitches and getting stuck on scenery do happen in places but with my hjet pack i was able to trick the game into releasing me from its grip relatively easily ... without a jet pack strapped to my back i had considerably more trouble doing so to the point of frustration ,This game reminds me a bit of Katamari Damaci in its art direction and it is quite funny in parts having me chuckle audibly at times.I would reccomend this game to anyone looking to just unwind after a long day and have some fun , I certainly feel as though I had my moneys worth there .I do look forward to seeing how much further the developers take this game in the future.8 out of 10 screaming goats"

It was not very clear what the mysterious voice was saying, and at times it didn't even sound human.About a week ago, I happened upon a very friendly goat at a petting zoo with my youngest brother. This goat was affectionately given the name ""Buttercup"" by the friendly farmer overseeing the events at the carnival. He was as ordinary as a goat can be, or at least as far as I could tell with my miniscule amount of goat experience.After we had left the petting zoo, that voice in the back of my mind blurted out with such volume I flinched as though about to be struck from behind. Looking behind me, I could see Buttercup staring perfectly in my direction, and knew what had to be done. I must attain understanding of the way of the goat, so that I could one day understand that ominous voice.Upon returning home, I turned to the only idea I had at the time: to search the internet for some sort of way to become one with the goat. This is when I stumbled upon Goat Simulator by Coffee Stain Studios, and knew my life was about to be changed.Opening the game, I was greeted by a friendly, oafy-looking goat with his tongue hanging halfway out of his face. What was most shocking was his resemblance to Buttercup. I became familar with how to move around as a goat, and even learned how to jump over the fence in which I was captive. I made a turn immediately to my left after looking at a home, and saw a construction site, so decided to start my adventure as a goat.Then, disaster struck.As I timidly began walking across the street, a large truck struck the side of me, and proceeded to roll me underneath his tires without the slightest intention of slowing down. Buttercup lay motionless in the middle of the street, and I was sure a fading black screen was imminent. However, a miracle occurred as Buttercup sprung back to life within an instant, and happily trotted off the rest of the way across the street.I continued my exploration of the construction site, and noticed an achievement spring forth in my lower-right screen entitled ""Angel Goat."" Shortly after, I was again struck by the semi-truck, sent flying into a gas station, and exploded on impact. I feared not for the life of Buttercup, and instead decided to see what this achievement had earned me.Upon returning to the main menu, I noticed the ability to use different skins for my little Buttercup under ""Custom Game."" My eyes instantly met with the Angel Goat skin, and I quickly loaded the game.Buttercup had developed a majestic white coat, with glowing gold eyes and a similar halo floating atop his head. It was at this time that the voice in my head finally made sense to me. That was my purpose in life, to become the Goat Messiah. While thousands upon thousands of other goats worldwide seemed hell-bent on destruction, the essence of Buttercup and his extremely strong moral compass to bring peace to the world of goats remained true. He and I had finally, and literally, seen the light, that our mission was to bring forth an era of peace between the frail human and the mighty goat.Now I, alongside my virtual Buttercup, spread joy to the citizens of Main Goat Map, and I hope this message may compel you to do the same.10/10, would return to Earth again to save."

While there is only a nod to Mining and Tunneling Simulator (in the super-secret-tunnel), this shows only that Goat Simulator is among the best in class for the Simulator and Simulacrum game genre.Also, you can headbutt people and then use your tongue to drag them into a pentagram in order to sacrifice them to the goat god.

He had many friends and was a straight A student. But he had one smally problem in his life: he was addicted to Goat Simulator. His parents started to get worried, so they forced him to uninstall the game after 1.000 hours of playing. He first cried, but he moved on from his scars, but the memory of the Goat never left him. He went to college and studies for zooneurology and engineering which he succeeded in, made lots of money with and made him meet his first girlfriend. After 5 years, they get happily married and after another 5 years, they were a happy family with 2 kids and a dog. It all seemed fine and well until something terrible happened: his wife, kids and dog got in a car crash and none could survive it. the Boy became depressed and when he was about to pull the trigger, a computer fell down a building but survived the fall. It had a game playing on it, but what game? Goat Simulator. The Boy went to his lab and constructed a machine that could transfer his conciousness into a goat. He later stole a goat from somewhere and transferred his inner child and spirit into the goat, leaving a braindead human body and a goat that was running amok in the city, and he went to live happily ever after until an Animal Protection Agent had to put him down. The End."

I even thought of Skyrim, which includes animal rights better than any other game, since apparently killing a chicken in any town gives you death penalty along with ""assassin shaming"" from everyone around.Then, it all become pretty clear to me. There is actually a game.GOAT SIMULATORyou play as a goat.A game where I can select my human companion and drag him with me across the map while I ride a bicycle with a stack of hats in my head. A game where I can meet with the ninja turtles or even dumbledoor, the grey. A game that allows you to throw deadmau5 from the roof of a skyscraper, only to become deadgoa7. You can even 9/11 a gas station in order to obtain the Michael Bay achievement. There is so much to do, to see, to experience and feel.With that being said, I believe that this award was made for goatsim, which has a pretty solid and rich content and gives you an incomparable overwhelming experience.I rate this game 9,7/10 ; Would choose it for   ""Best Use Of A Farm Animal""  every single year ."

Crashing a party with a giant boulder is unique and funny, but only the first time around. Other then the few interesting things you can do, you can just run around and trash the world. Again, this is funny for maybe an hour or so. In short, it is a great idea but could have been executed better. If there were more content I MIGHT see the worth of my 10 dollars, but I do not.

(rarely)You only can pick 5 mutators per round.Some of the achivements are not very specific on how you get them. For example one of them is ""Don't panic"" and it's description is ""srsly."" (NOTE: that achivement will be slightly less difficult if you read the book called ""The more than complete hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and you will get the reference then. BTW I have that achivement.)Too many goat  trophies to unlock.That's all I have to say. But given the review I just made, If you look closer there are more pros then cons. So I guess i gotta say that it is just kinda worth your ten dollars to buy it. I got it on sale when it was five bucks. But don't wait for a sale (I didn't, when I first saw this it was on sale). If you have ten dollars to throw around, there isn't a better use for them then to buy this game."

At first, it was fun to blow things up, ram into a protest, get run over by a car, spring way into the air, climb the highest building, and cause general mayhem and chaos. After getting hit by my tenth car and throwing myself off the sixth building, I had gotten bored. I should show this to my friends! But I am not a Youtuber, so maybe a multiplayer option?Oh wait. There is none.Well maybe someday--oh nope. The devs gave the players a big ""f you"" for any multiplayer option.Good for Youtube fodder and about 1-2 hours of solo play. After that, it quickly loses its luster.Some people enjoy it but I think I'll stick to games that are both zany with stuff to keep me coming back."

76561198116350619,Recommended,265930,28914326,Posted: 1 January,all,hi,"Goat Simulator is a joke of a game. It’s small, deliberately unpolished and buggy, and its design is simple. So it’s a good thing it’s a really funny joke, full of great physics-powered slapstick humor, and unexpected surprises in every corner of its seemingly peaceful small-town map. There’s not much actual gameplay here beyond breaking things for points, but shooting for a high score is probably the least entertaining thing about Goat Simulator. It’s mostly about exploring the fun house and discovering the hilarious surprises at your own pace.*Verdict:Goat SImulator isn’t much of a game, but it’s a hell of a good time. The small but dense map is packed with tons of jokes and bugs that should be seen rather than talked about, and there’s at least a few hours’ worth of entertainment in goofing around with the jetpack alone. It’s a clever interactive spoof of all the broken game physics we’ve seen in open worlds – almost like a greatest hits album of all the ridiculous bugs that pop up in serious games like Skyrim or Assassin’s Creed, except embraced and celebrated in a world that’s made to be broken"

Well, that you can actually break it. Properly. You beak a lot of things in this game, but I broke the game.Otherwise, it's the usual tale of blowing up petrol stations, rudely interrupting political rallies, trashing a food shop, bouncing off some very high places, thinking about licking paragliders, and goat half-pipe.Eat my goatness!"

I know it sounds fun, and I'm sure some people like the idea of a terrible game where you don't really do anything except try to glitch the game out pretty horribly to hope something funny happens, but in the end you won't anjoy it. You'll get maximum bored of this game.What it is: Literally a glitchy goat simulation game where you do silly stuff as a goat, you could be anything, though, really. Mods and whatever. You run around like a fool as a goat making those funny goat sounds from the youtube videos (Honestly the very best part is the funny sounds). Which is fun-ishWhat it isn't: worth money. There's a sale going on at the time of this review, so it might be worth the 75% off, that's up to you. At least, I have a coupon for it. It's fun for about 20 minutes unless you're interested in hunting for sometimes funny eastereggs and comedic situations. It's really just a game for satire.Don't expect anything substantial with this game, and the game devs know it. It'll be alright for a laugh if you're tripping sack or drunk as hell, but if you're kind of a serious gamer and want to do some intense things, this is so not the game for you and it's SOOOOOOOOO not the game for me. lol."

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

The game in which a barnyard animal runs around a small mountain community smashing and hopping and making horrible animal sounds! It's a simple, tried-and-true celebrate-the-chaos formula and it's making waves all over the internet and......I don't get it.It's fun for a bit, don't get me wrong. For the first 10 minutes or so, the whole kick/headbutt/lick/destroy everything in sight game play's kind of charming. After that, I had another 30 minutes spent enjoying the interactivity of the world. Even though it was buggy as hell and I had to use the RESPAWN button multiple times to dislodge myself from a surface, it had a kind of blatant Tony Hawk Pro Skater knock-off quality that I was excited about. What weirdness is hidden up this mountain trail? What easter eggs can I find inside these houses? What does the bacon do? For a while there I was really digging the game, warts and all... And then it was over.The world was every bit as small as it had initially appeared to be, and I'd clomped my way over pretty much all of it. The only in-game objectives I had left required farming points, which is a miserable chore no matter how you look at it. The Steam achievements were pretty inane. There weren't any hard-to-reach nooks or crannies left to visit that seemed worth the effort involved. Yes, there were certainly more Easter eggs to be excavated here, but it just didn't feel worth chewing the layers of dirt in the way. The unlockable bonus modes were cute, and defective, and fun to look at for about 5 seconds, but I had no interest in playing any of them, and now I own this tiny little nubbin of crap and there's no getting around that fact.Should you play Goat Simulator? Not necessarily. If you do though, will you get some laughs out of it? Almost certainly! Just don't buy it yourself.

You can butt, kick and lick many things in the map, and you can run, jump and lay down as movements.  It has several things that you can ride also.  It is a physics sandbox map game, where you go to explore, manipulate and destroy objects.  Has Steam achievements, some easy, some hidden and some hard.  Very funny game, but has No story or dialog.  Simillar to a certain Skateboarding game, where you get score for doing tricks and destroying stuff.  Will be buggy, lots of clipping objects and getting stuck.  Has Steam workshop with mods available.  You also get the Goat MMO simulator DLC for Free which parody the fantasy MMORPGs.Buy it for a good laugh and to goof off for a few hours, but make sure you get it on Sale. I recommend the Goty Bundle on Sale, which has a DLC Soundtrack and 4 DLC that add a new themepark to play on, that parody some other popular game themes and adds reasons to play Goat sim for a couple hours each.

I think I may have been affected by the videos I watched, making me aware of practically everything in the game with no surprises left for me to discover. I also believe this game has very little replay value even with the collectible and mod support, they don't seem to add much difference to the game.Personally I believe I could have spent my money in a better way but, of course, it's too late now. If I were to give this game a rating, I would give it a 4/10. This is just my opinion and it seems I am in the minority here so I'm sure most of you will enjoy this game but I really didn't."

I mean, viewers, if you actually try to get the achievements in the game, dont even bother trying becuase its so hard just getting to the locations, let alone doing the actual action without somehow spazzing out of control. Really, the main purpose of my stupid rant is that this game was only made to make money, and that is extremely evident with the dlc, i mean, come on. You can't really expect that this game was actualy supposed to provide prolonged enjoyment? Even watching the game is boring after a while, because the same things just keep happening.

I needed to experience my life as a goat. Goat Simulator has filled the void in my life.I knew as soon as I hit the truck with my goat that this was what I had been missing. I flew through the air in slow motion, tongue flying around, hitting the edge of the map and rebounding back, landing on (and falling through) the roof of a house. I could not get out, but that did not matter. I was treated with the ability to look down into the house beneath me, seeing the unsuspecting people casually sitting at their computers, oblivious to the sheer terror of the goat above them.Whether it was playing football with a basketball, swinging lampposts into groups of people or even doing 1080 degree flips, there was no limit to life as a goat. I didn't think it could get any better than this.I was wrong.As I jumped and screamed my way around the map, leaving a path of destruction in my wake, I happened upon a golden statue. Curiosity overtook me and I resisted the urge to grab it no longer. My life as a goat changed completely. I had a jetpack.I knew that this was meant to be, and what my mission from the Great Coffee Stain in the sky was. I was granted the supergoat power of being able to lift people and cars with my tongue. I could survive any impact. I could slow down time with mere thought. Now I could fly. It was time for world domination. Humanity had to be silenced so that the new goat overlords could reign supreme.All the humans are dead or enslaved. I have won. I am the goat, the goat is me.Go and goat this game. I kid you not, for mere bucks you can experience a sandbox like no other. Destruction, mayhem, death defying stunts. Seriously, there are more than 921 million goats in the world. Killing the humans was just part of the game. This is a SIMULATOR. Do you understand? A SIMULATOR. This can happen. There are enough goats out there to enslave us and/or kill us.It is your duty as a human to get this game, so that you may truly know your enemy. An enemy people do not take seriously, an enemy that we know nothing about. Coffee Stain studios have granted us the insight into the true terrifying reality of the impending Goatpocalypse. This is your weapon against the goats. Be prepared, for the goats are coming to get us."

,Recommended,265930,13099731,"Posted: 26 November, 2014",all,Heckbear,"Some time ago, I found my life rather... lacking.  You see, I had just finished my first year of college, and found my previously declared major to be rather unsatisfying.  I made the decision that rather than waste my time in the field of engineering, it would be better for me to declare my major to be something extraordinary.Goat Enthusiasm.I finished my last few years of college, graduating head of my class and sporting a proud PhD in Goat Enthusiasm.  Diving out into the world on my own, my PhD was proudly on the top of every one of my resumes, applications, and most importantly, it was the prime subject of any conversation I had with members of the opposite sex.For whatever reason, potential employers and lovers alike were absolutely... repulsed by me.  A PhD in Goat Enthusiasm wasn't qualification enough for life in the real world, apparently.  I began to sink into the deepest pits of despair.Enter Goat Simulator, the $10 that changed my life forever.  I remember searching in the deepest darkest corners of the internet, trying, yearning, for an opportunity to put my elite education to good use.  I stumbled across a video, showcasing one of the most marvelous feats of the 21st century.Immediately, I drained my savings of the last $10 it had, downloading this heavenly game, eagerly awaiting my lifelong dream.  I had memories of my parents telling me that if I believed hard enough, I could be anything.So I became a goat.The original map had me sold.  I strutted about, proud to put my education to good use, flying off water slides, blowing up semi-trucks, and sacrificing cruel human beings to become the omnipotent Demon Goat.And then: the Goat City Bay update.Delving into that update like an infant in a ball pit, I remember latching onto roller coasters with nothing more than my tongue, riding bicycles into elevators at which point I decapitated Deadmau5, stealing his head along with his bass drops,  and then kick-boxing the Michael Bay Turdles in the sewers beneath the city.It was, in a word, ecstacy.But then... Enter Goat MMO Simulator.Eager to join members of my own kind, fellow goat enthusiasts and gamers alike, I eagerly clicked the launch button the instant it finished downloading.  I was stunned at the great variety of classes, (microwave OP), and thrilled at the expansiveness and depth of the world.  With my fellow goats I journeyed through the realm, conquering evil and adding every... and I mean every... NPC to my inventory along the way.The reason the game made such an impact with me was how realistic the world was.  State-of-the-art physics engines combined with photo-realistic graphics, and bug-free gameplay let me know just how much work the developers put into this.  I mean, until now, it was only in real life that you could headbutt a gasoline tank, fly half a mile into the air and then land, tongue lolling, your rump underground.10/10, changed my life."

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.3.Grease a cake pan. Pound cakes are best baked in deep pans, such as loaf pans or bundt pans.4. Cream the butter and sugar. Place the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat them together until the mixture is light, fluffy and creamy.5. Add the eggs and vanilla. Keep beating the mixture until the eggs are completely incorporated.6. Stir in the cake flour. Keep the hand mixer on low or use a wooden spoon to stir the flour in a bit at a time until it's just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix it.7. Pour the batter into the pan.

Well, to be honest, never did I think of playing a video game as a goat at all.Goat Simulator turned out to be a pretty fun game to play at sporadic instances, much more than I expected. I held out for a good while before getting the game, despite so many good reviews, because I was just really doubtful that it was really that good.In all honesty, I was halfway right. The game is definitely pretty random as can be, which is its entire purpose really, and thus can make you laugh at some of the stupid things you'll find in it, if it fits your style of humor. There are so many pop culture references that make it simply enjoyable if you're able to catch them as they show up.But the game is relatively short-lived. While I enjoyed bouncing around, messing with all sorts of mods that the Goat is capable of using, once you find most of the things in the levels (which is easy to do), there's not much else to keep you going. While playing the game a lot and getting achievements, of course I had fun getting massive combos and destroying as much as I can, but it doesn't make me want to keep playing much now that I've literally found every single easter egg or possible action in each of the levels that I've played.The only one I could see people continuing to play is GoatZ, if they enjoy surviving and crafting weapons, etc. And I will say that GoatZ and the MMO levels were definitely more fun and entertaining than the first two levels - but I would highly suggest you play them in their original order. Otherwise, you might not have as much fun with the earlier ones.Is the game overall something that people should play? Yes. I think many people should have lots of fun with it, but many people will also probably stop enjoying it a lot quicker than I did, and there's not much that can be done with that.I still haven't played the PAYDAY expansion to the game, so I'll buy that eventually and try that out. The expansions definitely will give more life to the game and give you reasons to come back, but as I said, once you find out everything in a given level, I don't really see the enjoyment of continuing with it."

SUCCESS!  Definately worth the Five Bucks USD I spent on it.  Absolutely insane.Playing the MMO part of it, was crazy fun, absolutely anything you could dream of doing with a goat, you can do.Had your fill as a goat?  Run around as a microwave oven with legs that can blow up cars - or get hit by them! ...  Yes, you can run around as a microwave, and when you attack the door flies open and people go reeling.  So do pizzas, in fact.  I have never seen such a demented bunch of nonsense rubbish that was so entirely entertaining.  Have a few beers or a few whatever, and sit and play this.  It's just absolutely off-the-wall.  Nothing like it in 20 years of computing experience can compare to this kind of just...  I can't describe this game.  Goat simulator...  well, it was more like running around in GTA disguised as a microwave hell bent on revenge (for the non-mmo portion, obviously).If you get stuck or escape the map, just press ESC and respawn yourself back in, easy as pizza pie!  Rather quite the entertaining bit it is.  Definately recommended for <10 bucks USD it is a great deal, even more-so for half that much.The MMO Sim portion even included a spoof of a town in DIABLO (1) and a really catchy tune to go with it that was quite reminiscent of the tune we all heard firing up DIABLO for the 1st time.  I could lose hours into this no matter how upset I might have been going in, it was all smiles coming out in the end.   Sometimes you just need absolutely positively mindless nuts entertainment to feed your starved sense of humor after a hard day at work, this will fit the bill.  It's not am FPS, it's not really a first-person anything, it's just a 3rd-person free-roam that is quite a charmer.  The MMO Sim portion will fulfill your questing-genre desires quite nicely.  I welcome anything that isn't a Call of Duty clone.Absolutely no regrets on purchase.  Thank-you STEAM, 50% off great deal."

For more information, buy my book ""The Serpent Is Among Us"". Available onwww.morejesusplease.com)which rivals the brilliant works of Mel Gibson himself.

,Not Recommended,265930,9930544,"Posted: 25 April, 2014",all,Phoenix-Senpai,"Big surprise. I don't think this game is worth the $10 dollars. I so desperatly wanted to like this game with all the praise my friends give it, but it turns out as only another tool for Let's Players to make content with. Now be warned it even says it in the product description, but this game is a joke. It's job is to take a spin on how stupid the simulator genre of games has become and knows this well. But even funny dies after a while. This game is small. Vanilla Garry's Mod offers way more content at around the same price tag. I'd go invest in that instead. Now you may be skeptical and start screaming to the heavens that ""The game is based around Steam Workshop! When a good mod comes around then you'll see its true potential."" and my response is but you're buying this to play a game. Not sit around for an add-on to finally make your purchase worth it. On top of that, maybe I'm just cynical but I can count the number of times I've laughed at this game on one hand. Not good for a game made to be funny and crazy.Now stop there. As you can see, I've barely put any time into this game where the average reviewer has given it a good 8 hours of gameplay and a solid review has come out. Mostly positive. I've played so little because I could only bear so much. The world is so small and there is so little to do that it becomes bland after about 20 mins of playing. But I loved the concept of a jokey sandbox game from an indie dev so much that I kept coming back hoping to find the glimmer of gold that these other reviewers have found. *Note: I never found it. Think about it this way, if you taste a chocolate chip cookie for the first time it comes as a surprise. Not always pleasant, not always unpleasant, but always a surprise. Now let's say this chocolate chip cookie is all that is available to you anymore. Over time, regardless of taste that cookie will become more bland, boring, and tasteless. Just like this game. Sure you can change up the reciepe you used to make the cookie, give it sprinkles in the form of Workshop content, but underneath is that same damn cookie.Just a warning, unless you're under 15 years of age (years wise or maturity wise) you won't get a kick out of this game any longer than I have. Use your money and buy GTA, Fallout 3, or Just Cause 2. Grab some mods from the internet and have a great time. A great time that you'll be able to enjoy long after Goat Simulator has died out which will most likely be soon."

Unfortunately, the shine wears off rather quickly.  The map is incredibly small, and I think in less than an hour I had accomplised most of the challenges in the entire game.  Plus, the glitches that the creators are apparently so proud of, just ruin the experience for me.  Nothing in the sandbox works like it should; the jet pack is just plain frustrating, the tongue is absolutely useless, and clipping on every damn thing in the environment is not as inherently funny as the developers would have you believe.Anyway, good for 10 minute bursts, but definently not worth $10.

It relies on cheap humour and random bugs to entertain the player however the 1 hour of fun I got out of the game does not justify the price. While the bugs are sometimes hilarious, many of them are just plain frustrating and ruin the experience. The game also runs at an extremely low fps when over 10 ragdolls appear on screen. This would be acceptable if I wasn't playing on a system worth £2000. This game really is nothing but youtuber and streamer bait but still serves it's purpose as an overpriced april fools joke.

There are fun things to look for and do in the two main levels along with the things to find are power ups for your goat but when you use the power ups they can end up ragdolling your goat sending you far up into the air and turning your goat into a monster that looks like something from Dead Spase or some sick twisted game's final boss. The two main levels are varry small and you can quickly get from on end to the other you can do that even faster if your flying from somthing and its a little disappointing of how small they are and because of that there is not a lot of things to do in one map if you dont include the mini games. I cant really review the dlc because Iv played varry little of it but from what Iv seen and played from it is its varry hard. Over all my review looks like a negitve one but the game is fun because its embracing its badness by turning the complete game into a joke by having silly and odd things going on in the two small levels and also by having really good and wonderful easter eggs. So in the end I'd give Goat Simulator 8/10 BUT I'd only recommend getting it if its on sale ^_^ thank you for reading if you made it this far!"

While it only made me laugh a few times, there were some funny moments. The achievements act as the task for the game, and they are all pretty fun to find (seriously, don't use a walkthrough), but the mechanics of the game make this very frustrating, although downloading the Workshop mods can cheat around this. However, this means you have a choice between making finding items frustrating or boring, quite the Morton's Fork. Sadly, the only reason I played the game for this long was to find all the secrets as I'm quite the completionist, and I did find this boring. I'd recommend if it's either something you know you'd enjoy or on sale, otherwise I seriously wouldn't think it's a good idea."

,Recommended,265930,31675982,Posted: 10 May,all,Humonculous1,"Do you like murdering lots of things? Do you like beautiful dark fantasy settings? Are you a fan of simple yet skillful melee combat with a variety of weapons with some guns/bows/magic thrown in to top it all off? Need a 4 player co-op game to play with your mates? Then this game may well be for you.ProsVisceral melee and ranged combat, every hit feels satisfying.A wide variety of weapons, melee and ranged, that keeps slaughtering ratmen fresh.I'll be honest, before this game I'd never even heard of Warhammer Fantasy, but this game is a gorgeous realization of it. The art style and levels are a delight to behold and there's a good amount of variety between levels.There's a respectable amount of levels in the base game and the DLC maps keep things fresh if you are craving more.On the subject of DLC, the game has received a number of significant free updates as well as paid map packs that are well worth the value in my opinion. You can't queue for the DLC maps if you don't own them, but if you have a friend that has them you can play on them and receive the map-specific weapon drops for free.The combat is skillful and has a good range of difficulties to challenge experienced players.A robust crafting system to help you improve your arsenal and a set of special hats/weapons for experienced players to show off with.Knowledge of a level pays off with items that can improve your loot and or even increase the difficulty of the map if you want a proper challenge.Charming characters and amusing party banter. Miss a bomb throw? Your companions aren't likely to let you live it down.ConsWith the game being melee-focused, a bad internet connection can lead to a bad experience, i.e. rats hitting you from far away, blocks not registering etc.Item drops at the end of missions are semi-random, so it's possible to go on dry streaks of the stuff you want. This is mitigated with the crafting system, however.The game has a somewhat small player base, so doing specific non-contract missions if you don't have a 3 or 4 man group can occasionally be difficult. This is more true on the highest difficulties. Overall though the playerbase is more than large enough to enjoy the whole game solo.The game is a very fun and satisfying experience and I highly recommend it."

,Not Recommended,265930,31543692,Posted: 4 May,all,TheColorUrple,"It's because this game came out as a joke that it seems to be impervious to any reasonable critique, as if holding it to a certain standard means the humor was somehow lost on you.This is for the people who want to know if it's actually any good.In short, it's not. Goat Simulator definitely has its moments of humor, especially towards the very beginning when the physics, animation, and astounding amount of glitches are still new to your eyes. But these ""jokes"" wear thin quickly, and after 4 expansions of the same recurring issues, they become a frustrating burden.Let me exemplify this in a quick story. The game's final (and best) DLC, Waste of Space, has a full building dedicated to being a Portal parody. It's brilliant, really. Instead of Companion Cubes, you have Companion Cows that you can drag onto buttons, which activates a giant vacuum that sucks them upwards helplessly into a tube. There are deadly-looking lasers that break into pieces if you touch them. The turrets are Robot Chihuahuas. The visual aesthetic is interesting, and they keep the gag going for 8 or 9 test chambers before the end.I was actually enjoying myself until the game broke. The very last test requires you to deposit a cow onto a slide to open a door, because. Unfortunately for me, my cow was stuck inside a wall in the previous room. It clipped into there, as objects typically do in Goat Simulator, and no amount of headbutting or licking could dislodge it. Before rebooting the game as you would typically do in these situations, I went back to the cow ramp and quickly managed to glitch through the map. I was now in the space behind the level geometry, and I had a God's view of the entire map. I simply went to the corridor behind the troublesome closed door and ragdoll glitched back through it to continue the game. Unfortunately for me, the achievement for completing the mission was triggered by opening the door so I had to restart the whole thing anyway.I could stop the review there and you would have a very good idea of what to expect from Goat Simulator. It's a silly little game with a surprising amount of creativity, and it's almost worth playing to experience this. It feels fresh! There are two open world maps in the main game, plus one for each DLC, making a total of 6 to play through. None of them are particularly large, though they do get bigger with each subsequent release. The main draw is that every corner of the world has something *unique* in it. Unlike the copy+paste feel of an Ubi open worlder for example, these maps feel fresh with every new area discovered, and there's usually some joke or parody hidden there to briefly entertain you.But technically, the game is a broken mess. As a completely goal-free sandbox, I'm sure people could find some amusement messing around for a few hours. But each map has several objectives to complete. None of them are particularly hard, but doing anything in this game requires patiently enduring all of its bugs on a very regular basis.A common problem is found when having to lick something to bring it with you, which tethers the object to your mouth via your tongue. Sure it looks funny the first few times you drag a ragdolling NPC behind you as you sprint at full speed, but the objects you are required to bring with you constantly clip through the ground, get stuck in walls and doorways, and become a hassle to handle. This glitch isn't fun. Your character will also regularly clip into walls and fall through the map, requiring a respawn. If a specific item gets lost, you have to reload the entire map and often lose progress on whatever you're working on.Perhaps most annoyingly though are the ragdoll mechanics. Basically, whenever your goat runs into anything, be it a car or NPC or just tripping over a low curb, he will ragdoll for a few seconds before requiring tapping a key to get him up. This seems innocuous but it is so prevalent that getting anywhere in the game is done through a series of regular tripping, falling, getting up, running a few feet and tripping and falling again. Even jumping down any small height turns your character into a mid-air ragdoll, and hitting the ground bounces you around a bunch of times until the physics calm down and you can finally get up again. Over and over. This can only seem funny for the first few hours of play at best.These issues are especially noticeable in the DLCs, which add more ""game"" elements to the open world and require a little bit more effort to get done. The worst offender by far is the Goatz zombie expansion, which introduces a health bar and eating mechanic. Fortunately there is a God mode to enable that makes you invulnerable, because I can't imagine anyone enjoying trying to stay alive through hordes of zombies when there are so many things that will make you fall, get stuck, or ragdoll.Goat Simulator was released as intentionally broken, but this only excuses a small fraction of its issues. The developers seem to understand this, since the latest (and probably last) DLC, Waste of Space, has several game engine improvements that reduce the amount of clipping and glitching present in the game. It's as if they finally understood that an unplayable game ultimately isn't any fun, no matter how funny it is at first. But even in this noticeably more polished DLC, I still encountered game-breaking bugs several times, and the final crash to desktop helped solidify the fact that this game is still in an unacceptable state, no matter how many people say that it's all ""part of the joke"".Had Goat Simulator been a single release sold at a dollar or two without any DLCs, this could have been an easy recommendation for its creative open world design. (I would even recommend actual professional game developers take note.) But the devs continued the bad joke for too long, selling the original for too much and then tacking on overpriced DLCs to boot, without ever addressing the game's core technical problems. There's a decent game hidden in here somewhere, and I'm sure that a more competent developer could have easily kept the wonky ragdolls and animations while correcting the more gamebreaking issues.The whole experience is like listening to a person who has a good joke to tell but takes way too long telling it, tripping up in the details and structure so that the joke ultimately falls flat. That's Goat Simulator, and it's unfortunately not worth your money."

The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects.”The ReviewThe fact that this game was released on April Fool’s day should tell you a lot about it. Goat simulator is exactly what you’d expect. You play as a goat while you run around and destroy houses, lick people, jumping on trampolines and off pool springboards and finding collectables. The physics in this game are so completely out of wack, but that’s what makes this game as enjoyable as it is. You can become a demon goat and summon goat followers to throw them in front of cars. You can climb a treehouse to become the Goat King and your subjects (goats) will bow down to you. Goat Simulator is based around free-roaming and every area has something worth doing in it. The mission goals in Goat simulator serve as optional achievements. A few examples of these are pushing buttons to hear all the goat noises, seeing how long you can remain airborne, and sacrificing your fellow goats. Goat Simulator is also multiplayer, so you can flop around the map with your friends, licking everything that you see for hours.The graphics are decent and very pleasing to the eye. The soundtrack is just as wacky as the game with added screaming in the background whenever you murder a townsperson, and has avoided seeming repetitive. There are also a ton of mods out there, so when you get bored of the vanilla gameplay (which is doubtful) you’ll have plenty more options to spice the game up with.Overall VerdictThis game is hilarious and an excellent use of time. Definitely a must-have in everyone’s steam library!If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!"

,Not Recommended,265930,9736861,"Posted: 5 April, 2014",all,GOT A VAC  ADD OTHER *******!!!,"What is Goat Simulator?Recently there has been a lot of hype revovling around this game for its randomness and such, but is it really worth it to buy and play? Better question, will this game last you a long time, or at least long enough to get maybe a decent amount of hours in before your sick of it? For I regretably found the creul truth of this game, it's just not enough fun. There isn't nearly enough fun, wacky things to do as a goat in this game to keep you occupied. Of course, just as I did, you'll have an hour or so when you'll say something like""BEST GAME EVER!"", later you'll find out it's more of a in the moment feeling. I did have a good hour or so when it felt like it was so much fun, not knowing what to screw up as a goat next, but then very soon it was evident, the game got boring. (THE GAME LIVES OFF THE FACT OF YOU BEING A GOAT TOO MUCH!!!)What do you do in the game?The game consists of you, a goat, being well, a goat. You basically terrorize a small(and I mean SMALL) town and do what ever you really feel like whether it's ruin a family's dinner or grab a big boulder with your tounge and hurt stuff(kind of fun). Your main things you can do are move around with the W,A,S,D keys(duh), run with the shift key, use the E key to grab to stuff with your tounge and take it somewhere(maybe out for dinner?) and of course jump with the SPACE BAR. Also as you do more things in the game more small abilities unlock like the GOATBORN, which is basically you being able to Fus Ro Da as a goat, which I admit, can be fun.Should I Buy This Game?Really I don't know if I can tell you the answer completly, but I may be able to push a little towards my idea of the situation.    This game is is fun for only how long you let it be fun. By that I mean it's fun only if you sort of have an imagination or like just messing around with no real incentives, or goals. Personally, when I play a game I feel I need some sort of goal to push towards and acheive because well that's sort of what makes a lot of games fun. Now there are a few small ""goals"" you can do, but nothing really worth going into depth like doing a backflip, but earning nothing in return, horay. So if you want to spend 10$ on this game go ahead, just remember, the game in a nutshell dosen't have much substance to it so it won't last long if you don't like just messing around.NOTE: Also just like to note that there isn't any multiplayer, but there is a workshop kind of thing where you can doownload  other people's maps, which could grant a few more hours of play.VERDICT: 7/10 It's OkProYour a goatGives you a good laughOnly 10$(Could also be a con couldn't though?)Good if your bored one afternoon and have nothing to doConCausing destruction and such gets old after a whileGraphics glitch out(I realize that it's suppose to be in the game, but can be annoying)No goals or at least anything really worth striving to doCosts 10$"

In the process, the man-bear steals the head of the person playing in the concert, and gains the power to play loud music through his head.  Afterwards, man-bear attaches a rocket to his back and flies into a sewer, gaining repulsive abilities, allowing him to repel objects touching him at high enough speeds to break the sound barrier.  The man-bear is soon bored, and decides to take a trip to the fair.  He attempts to play a game, but in the process a normal man phases into the man-bear's body, and in an attempt to dance to man-bear's music, the man's arms grow to unproportionally long sizes and begin flailing about.

I can run games like bioshock infinite at 45 fps with ultra 1920 x 1080. I can run the witcher 3. But I can't run this game properly. There were so many bugs too. I remember hearing the developer said something like ""I kept the bugs in because it is hilarious."" No. No it isn't. Me getting stuck in a wall isn't hilarious. It just gets streamers to talk about it and gets them more views and in turn, you get more sales.So no. I can't recommend this product. It is silly but it is definitely not worth the price."

,Not Recommended,265930,24224899,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,Ass Cracula™,"Approximately thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker, the last known surviving Jedi Master, has disappeared. Both the First Order, a successor to the fallen Galactic Empire, and the Resistance, a military force backed by the New Republic and led by Luke's twin sister, General Leia Organa, scour the galaxy in an attempt to find him. Leia sends Resistance pilot Poe Dameron on a secret mission to the village of Tuanul on the desert planet Jakku, to meet with village elder Lor San Tekka, who has obtained a star-chart to Luke Skywalker's location. During the meeting, First Order stormtroopers under the command of Kylo Ren and Captain Phasma attack the village. Poe and his astromech droid BB-8 attempt to flee in their X-wing starfighter, but a pair of stormtroopers disable the engines with their blasters. With no alternative, Poe gives the star-chart to BB-8 and orders the BB unit to flee. Poe remains behind to cover BB-8's escape. After stormtrooper FN-2187 is deployed, FN-2003 is hit with blaster fire by Poe. FN-2187 goes to help his squadmate, but FN-2003's wound proves fatal, and in his final moments, FN-2003 smears his blood on FN-2187's helmet before dying, deeply affecting FN-2187. After securing the area, the remaining villagers are herded into the town square. Tekka is captured and brought before Kylo Ren, who demands to know where the star-chart leading to Luke is. Tekka responds that he knows who Ren used to be, and chides Ren that he cannot escape his real identity. Growing impatient, Ren kills Tekka by striking him down with his lightsaber. Poe takes a shot at Ren from cover, but Ren casually stops the blaster bolt in mid-air with the Force. Poe is captured, and Ren decides to interrogate him further back on their ship. Before leaving, Phasma asks what to do with the crowd of captive villagers, and Ren orders them all slaughtered. Stormtrooper FN-2187 is horrified as the massacre plays out in front of him, remaining motionless and not firing his weapon.Returning to the Finalizer, FN-2187 is overwhelmed with emotions because of the death of his squadmate and the massacre of the villagers. He ducks inside an empty shuttle to take his helmet off, breathing heavily, but Phasma notices him and tells him to submit his blaster for inspection, having earlier noticed that he did not fire a shot. Knowing he would be punished and re-evaluated for not firing on the villagers, and with his faith in the First Order severely shaken, he decides to desert. Meanwhile, after failed attempts of torturing Poe for vital information about the star-chart of Luke Skywalker's location, Ren uses his mind probe Force power to pry the information from Poe's mind. Ren learns that the star-charts are located within a BB series droid that fled the village, and informs General Hux of the new information.Elsewhere on Jakku, a scavenger named Rey traverses the corridors of a downed Star Destroyer at the Graveyard of Giants. Scavenging through the Star Destroyer, she finds a valuable piece of salvage and drops it in her satchel. Rey heads to Niima Outpost, and hauls the sack of salvage throughout the town. She then goes to Unkar Plutt to exchange her scraps for foodstuff, and he offers her a quarter portion for her salvage. After taking the foodstuff, Rey heads to her home, a downed AT-AT, and prepares a meal for herself. After finishing her meal, she watches a starship depart from the planet and then notices a distant sound. She immediately runs off with her quarterstaff to investigate. There, she encounters BB-8 struggling against being captured by a green-skinned humanoid scavenger named Teedo. She frees the droid and gives it directions to Niima Outpost and sends it on its way, but BB-8 insists on traveling with her. Rey goes to Unkar Plutt to again exchange her salvage for foodstuff, and the Crolute offers to buy BB-8 for sixty food portions; while tempted, Rey declines the offer. Plutt then sends two thugs to steal BB-8.Needing a pilot to escape, FN-2187 frees the captured Poe Dameron from his cell, and the two steal a Special Forces TIE fighter. FN-2187 mans the guns, killing several of his former comrades in the hangar, and then disables the Finalizer's turbolasers on the outside of the vessel. During the escape, Dameron asks the stormtrooper his name, to which he explains that he has been raised from birth to be a stormtrooper, and the serial number ""FN-2187"" is the only designation he has ever had. Not content with calling a man a number, Dameron names the trooper ""Finn"", from the FN in his name. Finn likes the name, and goes on to use it. Dameron also tells him that the map vital to the Resistance was located within his astromech droid. Before they can continue their conversation and escape, the TIE is hit by a missile fired from the Finalizer, sending it spiraling towards the planet below. Phasma reveals to Hux that this was FN-2187's first offense of non-conformity. A technician then informs Hux that the TIE fighter was projected to crash on Goazon Badlands, a canyon zone on Jakku. Realizing that Poe and Finn were going after BB-8, Hux sends out a squadron of search teams to the area.Finn and Dameron eject from the TIE shortly before it crashes, each landing separately some distance from the wreckage. Making his way to the crash, Finn finds Poe's jacket, but no other sign of the man, and the fighter sinks into the sand. Believing Dameron to be dead, Finn begins wandering through the desert, discarding his stormtrooper armor along the way and eventually arriving at the nearest settlement, thirsting for water. While Finn staggers to an animal trough to desperately slake his thirst, he notices thugs attempting to steal a BB unit droid, which Finn recognizes as BB-8, from a woman, Rey, but she fends them off with her staff. BB-8 notices Finn, wearing his master Dameron's jacket, prompting Rey to chase after him. Rey attacks Finn, believing him to be a thief. Finn explains that he had met and helped Poe escape the Finalizer, but that Dameron had apparently perished during their crash. The First Order tracks Finn to the settlement, and launches an airstrike in attempt to search for BB-8 and the map. Rey, Finn, and BB-8 attempt to flee towards a Quadjumper but TIEs destroy it. With only one option left, the trio manages to escape in the Millennium Falcon. Rey flies it through the Graveyard of Giants, while Finn fires on and destroys the pursuing TIE fighters. With the TIE fighters destroyed, they escape into space. Back aboard the Finalizer, Lieutenant Dopheld Mitaka informs Kylo Ren that the droid escaped on a stolen freighter and that it was aided by the deserter FN-2187. Ren activates his lightsaber and lashes out in a rage-fueled tantrum, slashing at an instrument panel uncontrollably. Mitaka tells Ren that they also appear to have been helped by a local scavenger girl. Kylo grows even more livid, using the Force to pull the officer by his throat across the room in order to choke him with his bare hands, and asking him what girl it was. While Finn and Rey celebrate their escape from Jakku, the Millennium Falcon breaks down. The ship is in major need of repairs, so Finn, Rey and BB-8 begin working to fix it. While they are working on repairs, the ship is caught in a tractor beam by a freighter. Although they initially believe themselves to be captured by the First Order, they soon meet their real captors: Han Solo and Chewbacca, the former owners of the ship. Upon boarding their old vessel, Han and Chewie go about inspecting their ship and find the two stowaways, Rey and Finn, who he assumes were the thieves that had stolen the Falcon. When Rey and Finn explain that they were going to take a droid named BB-8 to the Resistance because it has a map that would reveal Luke's location, Han and Chewie agree to help them. Unfortunately, Han's freighter, the Eravana is been boarded"

Everyone was exited for Goat Simulator ""Multiplayer"" MMO, But they trolled us. Even in that chat people complain about cod, If you haven't noticed already if you have the game, No one freaking answears you're questions in chat. First they put up a game with a lot of funny glitches you can rag doll go to space jump on whales headbutt a lady get free hats! Oh how fun that was. But once they ♥♥♥♥ing released  Goat Simulator MMO ""Multiplayer"" boy was I exited hop on the game realized it was a ♥♥♥♥ing troll.. I don't like the game anymore. If they tried to not troll us Im sure they would get a lot more people buying the game and they would make more money, Now there losing money that they could have made because a lot of people who wanted to get the game now know this is bs. Lets get on with this.GraphicsGraphics are pretty decent not gona lie.DisclaimerGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.Gameplay WiseGoat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! Or you could just give Steam Workshop a spin and create your own goats, levels, missions, and more! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.Dont know a titleI could see this being and enjoyable 1 hour of fun for $1 and then everyone forgetting about it however to spite all logic and common sense this game exploded with popularity and coverage when it came out, everyday i would hear someone say to their friend ""Hey have you heard about goat simulator...dude, the devs kept all the bugs in LOL"" this word of mouth affect was definitely the most obnoxious part of this game but i suppose i should actually talk about the ""Game-play""Goats...Jetpack goat- Even less control and enjoyment then normally playingQueen goat- Spawns more goats, Just in case your frame rate was too highMinecraft goat- Sigh...This game is $10. That’s $10 to hear the same joke over and over again, $10 that could be spent on a KFC lunch which is much more enjoyable and probably won’t make you hate the gaming community. If you want a random glitchee experiment that won’t cost you money just wait till YouTube changes their layout.PersonallyI had felt bored with the game after an hour of playing, which didn't feel to be worth the money I had spent on it. Though the game uses the excuse of ""It's meant to be bad!"" I do not feel that it should excluded from being treated as a normal game would, and that games should not follow its trend of purposeful irony. Though you may also use the excuse of graphics not being all to a game I say that there is no reason they could have not designed this game much better, especially with the engine and resources they were given to do such. In my final opinion, I would not recommend to buy this game unless you have money to burn, which I and most others certainly do not.OverallI dont recommend this game I would give it 3/10.Thanks for taking you're time to read my reveiw!"

Goat Simulator doesn't take itself seriously and doesn't need to; if you were a goat, would you?Plus, the recent Goat MMO Simulator expansion adds a ton of new content, classes, secrets, maps, and goatiness and is completely free!But please, don't take my word for it. Below is the testimony of a plethra of real, live goats (I interviewed them myself) that speak to the truth of my statements:""10/10 The story is what I really liked; it really goats to you."" - Goatinator2000""goat/10 I was goated into playing this game, but after playing it a while, I was forced to admit it was pretty goat."" - GoatRack""0/10 not enough goat"" - 1337.Goatz""goat/goat Pull up your chairs, hang up your goats, and prepare yourselves for a wild ride, cuz baby, you're gonna goat it."" - Goatimus Prime""0/10 too much goat"" - 1337.Goatz""9001/10 just enough goat"" - Not1337.Goatz"

They were upset since they confirmed wasting money on a game that was pointless. I heard the title and decided to check it out. I decided to buy the game, which was titled Goat Simulator. It seemed amusing so I purchased it to see why the children hated it. Once I began to play my eyes fell from my eye sockets and urged into my mouth, they ripped my vocal cords out played a solid game of jump rope with them. I also smelled the tangy richness of dung that fell from my butt crack and released all over my bedsheets. I began hearing loud explosive words fill my head as I pictured horrifying drawings of Bill Cosby naked and the illuminati all around my wall.

Believe me, it has it's moments. But that's coming from a CoD loving, constantly swearing, easily impressed 12-Year old who thinks he's tough because he knows how to dos/ddos. I understand that the whole point of the funny glitches in this can be funny, and that's true, they are. but i haven't been playing this game for ages and ages, even though Garry's Mod has a similar premise.The game runs like crap, i can't for the life of me get it over 30 FPS. I dare say, it's to the level of Chivalry. and worse. highest is around 30 FPS, and that's on a 2009 HP Touchsmart. I have to look slightly lower than the middle for anything NEAR 30  FPS. on MINIMUM graphics. So that's something Garry's Mod does better.The jokes wear off quickly. And this game doesn't have that much besides ""LOOK!

Just from the trailer, you can see how much time and effort they put into this.First, let's start with each part of the game (that I have currently played).Levels: Very expansive, very roomy for a goat, and extremely active. Let's say, you want to go into a store. You can do that! You can even leave with a bag of Doritos, if you really wanted to! Or, maybe, you want to interact with other goats. Well, what if I told you that you can achieve to be the official queen of all goats? You can do all this, and much more, on just the very first level.Goat MMO Simulator: Very hyper chat, with a not-too-hard leveling system. From the very second you start up Goat MMO Simulator, you'll be greeted with a flourishing chat box. I'm not saying this is bad, as you, too, can enter in your own messages. The quests in Goat MMO Simulator range from easy to hard, but gaining experience to level up isn't such a worry! All-in-all for Goat MMO Simulator - I was impressed by the level of thoroughness of this update.Wait... microwave? Yes, you can pretend to be a microwave as a goat. You can be many other things, but I do not want to give out any spoilers to anyone who hasn't yet played the fulfilling storyline you just may get out of it! The only way to get more ""costumes"" is through playing the game itself, collecting various things, exploring the map, etc.. It's a very nice touch that they added.Final verdict: I give this game a shining 11/10. It exceeded most of my expectations of gameplay and replay value.Tl;dr - Large levels, quite a MMO, and microwaves. 11/10."

I sold my USP Guardian Factory New StatTrack for this....So you can figure out for yourselves that I would make this sacrifice for a .... well stupid and absolute useless game.I first got this game a few months back, I played a demo, and loved it, but yeah $14 for this... well ... ""stupid and absolute useless game""  jyst seemed too much. So I waited, and waited, and then I recieved an email. ""Item on your wishlist is on sale"". I started crying. Because I sould my USP for this. But 12/10 would sell my USP again.OK so now the actual review and not my self pitty:DAY1:spawn for the first time ever, walk out of my goat tower thingy, saw grass. Goat instincs takes over and licked grass. Tungue was too long, licked a garbage bin. Garbage bin fell over and got hit by a car. I went flying and ended up in the woods. 12/10 would lick grass again.DAY2:I woke up in the woods, I hear som Hillbillies racing, i would through the grass, get it by a car, 13/10 would go to Hillbillies again.DAY3:I woke up next to a baseball net course tingy, I enter and experience weird intercource with the ball shooter. I am a goat ball cannon now. Someone up in the heavens above gave me this power to do good and save the world from pure evil. Shot a little kid in the face, baseball bounced off his face, hit a gas tank, it exploded, i land in the road, got hit by a car. 15/10 would have intercource with a baseball cannon and use it for pure evil.DAY4:woke up in the road, stood up, got it by a car. 20/10 still beter spawning system than CODDAY5:I decide to go home for the night, enter my goat tower. Goat tower is actually a portal to the goat Nirvana and I become the new ruler of goats and messed up Taylor swift youdtube video edits. 15/10 would sit on throne again.DAY6 (Day 1 as ruler):I leave my quaters to walk my home lands, look and take in the beautiful view of my kingdom.As in Lion King, I see the shadowy areas, and run there immedeatly. Found a weird sign on the ground, licked 10 guys, used my new power as king to become goat demon. 666/10 would go to shadowy areas again.DAY7:With my rign over this lands, I rain goats everywhere. Like legit I press spacebar and it rains goats LOL. 13/10 would rain/rign as King againThis game is very funny, and great entertainment if you have a friend over, and you dont want him to destroy your K/D on your favourite game. Yeah it gets repetitive, but then you play GoatZ or MMO. Buy it, you will love it, and it is cheap entertainment!Dont listen to these other reviews that justs down votes the game, this game isnt GTAV or Witcher, it didnt cost you $50 it is $14 or even $3 on a sale.

If you're a human, it has a wide variety of things to do... but as a goat. Regardless of whether or not you are a goat, you are playing as a goat and will do goat things. You can do anything from learning dragon shouts to practicing Satanic Occultism and being blessed, or cursed, with Satanic Goat powers. At some point, you might even smell like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Everything that would concern a goat. It even has that horribly annoying, incredibly catchy Sims 2 music.In half an hour, I scaled a skyscraper via mattress springs, and assassinated Deadmau5 by headbutting him off the skyscraper. I sacrificed people to the Goat of Mendes (Baphomet) in exchange for satanic powers, learned a dragon shout, summoned several minions, swung bombs into a truck, sending it towards a gas station, causing the station to Michael Bay. I then pranced through the explosion in slow motion, in a very 80s-action movie vibe. I headbutted a tank of fuel and went crashing into a construction site. I catapulted into the ocean, landed on a whale, and got catapulted back up to the catapult.I know that sounds absolutely absurd but it's far too absurd and descriptive for me to have made up. As a man once said, ""You can't make this♥♥♥♥♥♥up.""And you can't. When you have goat simulator, there is no such thing as boredom. Sure, there are plenty of better games out there, but if you ever get bored, there's always Goat Simulator. And it's a LOT more constructive than going into Sims 2 when you're bored and killing your sims by setting an oven fire or drowning them in a pool."

It's not for everyone, but it definitely has a place in some people's steam libraries.There's no story to speak of, the world itself feels rather empty at times, and the actual gameplay basically revolves around the strangeness of the physics engine. If you end up playing for more than an hour or so, and you've gotten over the novelty of ""lol, goats,"" the game basically boils down to getting achievements. There are a decent number of achievements (both in-game as well as steam achievements) to keep you busy exploring the world and attempting crazier and stranger things with your goat. That's basically the closest thing that this game has to a ""goal.""I put several hours into the game, and eventually moved on to other games, but this was a nice reminder that not every game needs to be a perfectly polished triple-A gem or a deeply meaningful indie title or whatever. Sometimes games can be about goats and broken ragdoll physics and silly in-jokes."

Well I'll tell ya why...After about 22.9 hours of gameplay (Might as well be 40 hours at this point, because I am about to go play it when I'm done with this review.), I realized that this is the best game like ever! Gravity does not exist in this game as people will tell you time and time again, you play as an annoying goat, you can swim (kind of), headbutting is a necessity for those turds who walk in front of you without saying excuse me (RUDE >:/ ), and there are different goats (and even weirder things/mammals/objects) that you can unlock for more fun. It's even funnier when you headbutt a person so hard that they look like that rubber chicken thing that you get from the store, one of the best things to look forward to in this game!! Did I mention that I almost fell out when my goat turned into Deadmau and the citizens of the town had no choice but to dance? Im not going to spoil everything for you, but this game is really hilarious!

It's spawned spinoffs, screaming youtubers, silly mods, and has really become a mini cultural phenomenon considering it started as a joke. On the surface it may seem like a total gimick; but thanks to suprisingly detailed maps, character unlocks, a great sense of humour, workshop support, dlcs and more, there's actually a lot to find here if you don't take it too seriously. On sale this game is a complete steal. But if you're starting to feel like there's nothing more to this game then licking people and ragdolling, really try to explore the maps. Look up guides if you must; I really think there's enough wit in this game to keep everyone entertained. Whether it be it's grotesque glitches, self-aware ridiculousness, light hearted parodies of other games (goat mmo, goatz, etc.), or it's mods, I think that if you overcome the initial impulse of calling this game a glitch filled mess, you'll really have a good time, at LEAST for a good 4 or 5 hours.Seriously, live a little and buy the freaking game."

Fun? Cool? Original? Creative? Whatever it may be, don't push this game away just yet. It may be for you. But this is what I thought of it.When I first heard of the game I was little curious to see what it had in stock for me. I looked through the trailers and a little bit of gameplay and it seemed pretty cool at first. I was especially curious to see what the PAYDAY 2 mod had in stock for me. So, when the time came for it to go on to sale I snagged it for $2.49 along with $1.24 for the PAYDAY 2 mod.This is basically what I got out of it....Pros:*Graphics are actually alot better than I thought they would be for an indie game... 7.5/10*Soundtracks and sound effects are on par for this game.... 8/10*Several different charactersCons:*Small worlds with only 2 maps and MMO map in the base game, if you want more maps you have to buy the DLCs (DLC maps have add ons, such as characters, larger maps, cool new features (drivable cars-cant drive cars in base game)*Annoying controls (overly sensitive mouse view with no ability to add and use a controller)*No tutorials - a bit pointless in this game but can teach you how to do simple and cool tricks and stuff*Overall pointless gamplay - this is basically the heart of the game, if you like flying around with a goat strapped with rockets, attacking civilians, or ramming cops then this is your type of game. However, if you want some sort of direction in what to do then I really can't recommend it.Final thoughts...Overall, like I said before, this is a game you might like if your interested in doing completely pointless stuff, hanging out with friends, or just trying to kill the time. If your looking into some sort of minigame, storyline, or objective then this is definently not your type of game. For me, or people who are interested in some sort of direction, I really can't recommend this. But if your into an arcadish waste of time game then this may be for you. Don't excpect to stay attentive on this game for more than 10 hours even if you are into it.Final scores...Graphics.............7.5/10Sound.................8/10Lasting Appeal....2.5/10Gameplay...........5/10Overall...............5.8/10Hope this review helped you make a choice on this game and you have a nice day.P.S.

The game has a bundle of laughs and a number of comical jokes. The major problem the game has; is that the fun does not last outside the short few hours that you learn the game. This game is just a dead end made to kill a couple hours of time. Outside of the level editor, it has no real replay value. This game is simply best played with friends or it quickly becomes boring."

Though there maybe glitchy Physics they are hillarious to watch as if it was an EA game at launch(Sorry EA!)! What's even funnier than that is an achivement for the game crashing LOL, and the game devs being in the game( or the building at least). Done with Goatville? Go to Goat Coastal Bay. A bigger map with tons of more stuff like: a Dam, a UFO, a Whale, a amusement park, a Helicopter, a obsitcle course, a hat shop(find money in-game to buy a hat) ,and a Deadmau5 party! Goat SImulator has huge Mod support but the only problem I have is that mods must be updated to the current version by the creators but you can have tons of fun with them. Goat Mutators are fun too which you can combind to extend gameplay. P.S. some muators must be unlocked.

,Recommended,265930,12747524,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,Ryxus,"EDIT: My original review for this is down below. Let me restate my claim for this game.This game is an open-world sandbox game that allows you to go between two gigantic places. It has a free DLC called Goat MMO Simulator, and just released a DLC called GOATZ, which is obviously making fun of DayZ. It has so many references to other things it isn't even funny. I'll tell you, it is well worth your money. 8/10This game...where do I begin? It's basically an open-world sandbox game where you play as a goat. In a town, full of humans and some other goats. I give it a 6/10."

Basically a massive playground with  multiple ways to cause the destruction you always wanted to do.... AS A GOAT!!! Steam achievements are easy to get and the bugs I encountered are more expected than a glitch. It just adds to the humour when something does bug out. Found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. Climb buildings, headbutt things. Casue as much havoc as you can. Can also evolve into different goats dependant on achievement unlocked. Blast for 5 mins or an hour long session (which I found myself doing at 1am in the morning!) For the price, well worth it!"

You never run out of things to do; nothing is static, and everything is open for your exploration (and destruction).

Just ask any goat or your 'local ladies' in your city.A game based around a ragdolling goat - you can break almost everything and gain points for a bigger combo score using physics and Micheal Bay explosions.So I bought this game ages ago after seeing it being played on Youtube; I only just reinstalled it again after a long break from it; now I remember why I uninstalled it...Yes, it may be fun at first although it wears off very quickly (even with the workshop addons). The repeated actions of smashing things, delivering things and ragdolling around and off things grows old quickly. With the lack of an actual story  plot and more of a goal based system - nothing really can be advanced on it.Cool idea with all the physics, but boring in the long run with no replay value.5/10 Stars"

For once, I made the right purchase decision and have had a GREAT TIME in the one hour I've played today! I do with the maps were a bit bigger, but with all the stuff you can destroy and all the humans to walk, it makes up for it instantly.Although this game is great, I must ell you ONLY BUY WHEN IT IS ON SALE. It's not worth the $10 they are asking, but it is worth like $6-7. I will also say that the controls by default are a bit.. weird. Prees 1 to BAAA. Right click to flip over. E to lick(aka pick everything up and drag it). The default controls are OK, but if you're not used to playing with a keyboard, you'll probably want to change the key bindings a bit.In the end, do I reccommend this game? HELL YEAH.

If you are not like me, then you might like this game.I enjoy mechanics, exploring, and occasionally story.  So why did I get Goat Simulator?  A friend told me of the MMO aspect of the game, which is a faux MMO of sorts or a parody of it.  I loved the concept.  And when I played it I thoroughly enjoyed it for 10-20 minutes.  I then left it alone, uninstalled it, and then reinstalled it after awhile.  I then played the MMO part again and the base game and found it temporarily enjoyable.  I liked exploring a bit, but that joy ended quickly (not much to explore in the base game), and the MMO part lost the funny appeal part to me.Basically, I got this game because I explored it fairly easily, the mechanics were...goat-like I guess?  And obviously it has no serious story.  I wasn't expecting any of that to a degree, but from the MMO aspect I was expecting more parody like elements that actually worked in some way without it just being similar absurd mechanics across the spectrum.  My friend found something in it that I didn't see after playing it for awhile.So let me put it this way, if you enjoy almost absolute absurdity, then this game is for you.  I'm still glad I bought the game though."

Yes, that is right it takes me 1 HOUR TO GET INTO THE GAME. But 1 hour just to get into goatville 1 1/2 to get into any other map. Not to mention when I get into the game I have a tiny lag spikes every 10 seconds  that brings me down to 5 fps or a giant lag spike every 20 that brings me down to 1 fps or 0 and almost crashed the game and the computer.

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

,Not Recommended,265930,10508035,"Posted: 17 June, 2014",all,Chad Kensington C-137,"PREVIOUS REVIEW FROM ABOUT TWO YEARS BACK:Awesome goat madness. Can it get any better? Yes. There are workshop addons!NEW REVIEWIf there's any better way to waste your money on a game that you will easily get bored of playing after an hour, then this game is for you!Do you want 3 $5 DLCs that are a complete waste of money? Two words for you, pal! GOAT. SIMULATOR.Do you also want frustrating controls and an unpolished game? Goat Simulator!I cannot believe I spent 46 hours on this game. Too bad it's past it's refund eligibility, I suppose.I cannot reccomend this game. I don't know if it's the awful attempts at slapstick humor, the pointless money leeching DLC, or the overall boring gameplay.Pros-Play as a goat-Reasonable amount of workshop itemsCons-Terrible slapstick humor-Bad controls-God awful music that sounds like a 5-year old's first original song on his Little Tikes keyboard-Ugly low texture quality on human characters-Pointless DLC that adds one new mechanic (or none at all)-Frustrating quests that aren't even worth it in the end-References to old internet memes-Desecrating the names of many funny movies/games by referencing them-Developers don't even care about their silly ""harmless"" bugs that can sometimes glitch you out of the map or crash the game-Freezes. A LOT.-If you don't have a moderate PC, the game looks and runs like crap. Even then. the game still looks like crap. Even on the highest graphics setting.-Did I mention the ear-bleedingly terrible music?-Made me loose my will to liveOverall, 2/10.TL;DR: Goat Simulator is not a good game and you should not waste $10 (or an extra $22.96 CAD if you want the DLC and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soundtrack with it) on it."

See falling whales, be a falling whale, ride a skateboard, explode more stuff, go into space, headbutt goats, kick goats, lick goats, fly, win a soccer game, step in poop, try to do anything to kill yourself and fail, do the impossible (except play a better game), ride a rollercoaster, catapult people out to sea, being a penguin, breaking glass, breaking everything else, break the game, try to kill people to fail and see them get up and resume a normal day again, eat copywritten junk food, spit burgers, spit bombs, BAA!, run on walls, rage that your failing to run on walls, buy a hat, lose your hat, have a person ride you, bounce in a bounce house, get catapulted into a castle to disturb a T-rex eating a steak, find true love with a tire to have 'Your beloved' despawn.And Much MUCH MORE!

The gameplay is the bare minimum here, and honestly wasn't fun in the slightest.While Goat Simulator tries to satirize many questionable game decisions/trends, it doesn't do so very well. Ultimately, the humour featured throughout is very low brow and immature. If you consider yourself relatively intelligent, chances are you won't be laughing with this game.Don't waste your money on this title."

The entire premise of goat simulator is rather straightforward, rag doll physics and goat.  That's it.  There isnt a real goal.  There is stuff to do but you just end up doing it as a matter of exploring and not with a real purpose in mind.Goat Simulator is a novelty gag.  There isnt anything to it beyond that.  It is a game that you pick up for an hour and then never play again until you've completely forgotten what it was about a year later so you pick it up for an hour then.It's fun and goofy with what it does, but those good qualities are so fleeting before it all becomes pointless.  I'd like to like this game, but there is no substance here.Addendum: I realize the ammount of time it says.  I didn't play this game that long-- not even close.

The only way I can describe this game is comparing it to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, except instead of Tony Hawk, you're a goat.  There are quite a few glitchy moments to be had, but I'll let those slide because after all, this game doesn't take itself seriously in any way.  You're a GOAT!  The custom game option is where Goat Simulator really shines.  There are a number of collectables and mutators to unlock in your adventures, such as playing as an Ostrich or flying with a jetpack, which gives the game a ton of replay value.  Also, there are many mods you can download for the game to endlessly add to the fun.  Here is where the game gets really fun...you can play in local co-op with up to four players!!!  And in case you lost count along the way...that's four goats wreaking havoc on the population.  There is explicit content in the game in the form of foul language, but if that's not your cup of tea, it can be turned off from the main menu (Apparently the Goats were big fans of N.W.A.).  Found around the maps are mini-games, such as Capture the Flag and Timed Trials, just to name a few, and they can be played with up to four of your friends.  So whether you are goating it alone, or playing with your friends, there is fun to be had for everyone!  I'm giving Goat Simulator...8 out of 10."

,Recommended,265930,30324629,Posted: 4 March,all,Uncle Cornpone,"Taz Mania is a 2D side-scrolling platform/adventure video game developed by Recreational Brainware and published by Sega on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1992. The game is based loosely on the Taz-Mania cartoon series. Similar but alternative versions of the game were also developed by NuFX and released on the Sega Game Gear and by Technical Wave on the Sega Master System. Other different Taz-Mania games were also published by Sunsoft and released on the SNES and 2 games on the Game Boy were made too. One from David A. Palmer Productions and published by Sunsoft and another from Beam Software and published by THQ.PlotThe plot of the game was actually a twist on the usual ""Save the World"" story setting for many platform/adventure games. One evening, Hugh Tazmanian Devil was telling his three children (Taz, his sister Molly and his brother Jake) an intriguing tale: Once there were huge giant seabirds that laid giant eggs which could feed a family of Tazmanian devils for over a year. There are also legends that somewhere along the island of Tasmania, there is a Lost Valley, where the giant seabirds still nest. Taz becomes fascinated by the prospect of the potentially large omelet and leaves in search for one of those giant eggs. Thus, the player must direct Taz across various stages in search for the Lost Valley and its Giant Bird.GameplayPlayers control Taz as he searches for the giant egg. Taz is able to jump, spin into a tornado and eat various objects. Spinning into a tornado allows Taz to defeat most enemies, as well as gain extra jump distance, knock away items and get past certain obstacles unharmed. Taz has the ability to eat most, if not all items throughout the level, such as health recovering food items, extra lives and continues. Eating some chilli peppers allows Taz to breathe fire in order to defeat stronger enemies, while eating a star grants Taz temporary invincibility. Other items, such as bombs and weed killer can be thrown at enemies, but will damage Taz if he eats them.DevelopmentRecreational Brainware was led by 2 programmers – Burt Sloane and Jonathan Miller and was based in San Francisco. A semi-sequel to this game in design and concept but unrelated to the Taz-Mania cartoon series was also developed and released by Sega on the same platforms in between 1994 and 1996, entitled Taz in Escape from Mars.ReceptionReview scoresPublication	ScoreMegaTech	82%[1]Sega Power	89%[2]The Mega Drive version was a bestseller in the UK for 2 months.[3] Mega placed the game at #19 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.[4]"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

It has a fantastic background with a non-linear gamestyle, allowing you and your character to create their own adventure. Choose from five goats, one level, loads of powerups and alternating battle cries. Assert your dominance in the harsh lands of the average white american town, become queen and even sacrifice your kind to the demon lord Bob Ross. You will be entirely immersed by the realistic physics and graphics. I think this game should win GOTY 2014,- A satisfied, and now lifeless, customer."

What is important is that they have done this in an entertaining and fun way.System compatibility is good, the game is playable on modern systems with a surprisingly robust set of graphics options (although there is always room for improvement).Obviously as what is largely a ""joke"" game, there's limited long term playability and the developers have admitted they don't mind some of the bugs, which is problematic, but they've developed the game in such a way that the quality is still generally high, and not insulting to gamers."

These were these weird creatures known as goats and they walked on four legs, exhibiting an unrealistically long tongue and strange neck physics.  Not a single boxing glove in sight and no grand arenas such as Madison Square Garden, 20th of May Stadium, and the Areneta Coliseum.  Instead, there's this non-descript town that has no boxing ring.  How could the developers deceive boxing fans who wanted a true simulation of the legendary boxer that fought in legendary fights  against Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier, and George Foreman?  A true insult to boxing fans everywhere!"

Like in a normal serious game (like Dishonored, for example) when you hit someone and they ping off into space, it's funny because it's not supposed to happen. It's unexpected. In this game it is supposed to happen, and it just gets old. Also, the new DLC ""Goat Simulator: Waste Of Space"" is a ""Waste of Space"" on your hard drive. Don't buy it.

The title kind of says it all: it was a sort of sudden fad, and it was never meant to be taken seriously. In all terms, it's a joke. It's funny for the first maybe half hour or so, probably less, until you get bored with the ""game"". The map is rather small and pretty repetitive, there's nothing very exciting or remarkable I can think of when I imagine it. The gameplay, is, well, wacky and silly, but it's also buggy and sometimes just flat out boring. You can headbutt things, drag things around with your tongue, toggle slowmotion and ragdolling, and doing flips. Based on this, you'd imagine there'd be quite a lot of interesting things to do, but not really. Eventually things sort of blend together into a grey, dull mess. There are achievements in game, but the core gameplay isn't really inticing enough to make getting them feel rewarding.With the recent MMO update which I haven't played, I felt compelled to write some things about this ""game"". Really, it's not a game. It's a ten dollar joke and the punchline kind of sucks. TotalBiscuit's review covers my thoughts of this title completely. With things like this getting actual praise and the way the gaming industry has changed in the last 10, 15 years, I sometimes get a little depressed about the whole situation, and this is a shining example of why. Goat Simulator has lots of potential, but I doubt it's going to reach any of it. In a way, I see it as just a cash grab. The advertising was large, the product was mediocre, and they got away with it."

,Recommended,265930,16810077,"Posted: 30 June, 2015",all,Aoi Blue,"Goat simulator is a very simple physics sandbox game.   You're a goat that is lose in an area populated by humans.   You have a sticky tounge that can grab stuff and you can kick, headbutt and run into things, and they react in the physics engine.There are achievements, easter eggs and collectables, and Goat MMO simulator adds an area with quests, but what you will most likely do in the game is just goof off.They didn't bother attempting to reduce the commonly known physics bugs, but instead let you play with them like the geek you are always wants to.  (I suspect they even intentionally tried to make a few worse.)  In the worst case you simply get stuck and have to respawn.Unlike most other intentionally broken simulator games, you don't have to wrestle with the controls.I know what you are thinking, how can such a stupidly simple game be fun.   It just is.To put it simply, this game throws you in an unreal silly world as a goat and lets you, and encourages you to wreak havok.   It somehow appeals to the innate human desires for and fastination with destructive testing.Mind you, this game is not perfect, and there are still some problematic bugs, most of them platform specific.  However, the developers do a good job of trying to keep on top of them, and rarely any of them are really so bad that they make the game unplayable.  If you look at the patch history you will see how much well the developer has done with bug squashing.Also, it runs nicely on Linux minus a few known bugs.To sum it upPros:You get to destroy the world as a Goat!One of the best Super Silly fun games out there!Actively worked on by Developers!Full Linux and Mac Support!Dev kit to create mods and maps!Steam Workshop with Mods and maps!Did I say you get to destroy stuff?I can't stress this enough:  smashing stuff is just fun!Option to toggle any offensive content to make game kid friendly.  (Mostly removes/replaces crude humor.)Cons:Some graphics glitches on Linux AMD Proprietary driver.No Dev kit for Linux.Poor current selection of community made maps.Who would like it:Anyone who loves to goof off.Anyone who loves sandbox games.Anyone who sometimes just loves to smash stuff.Who wouldn't like it:FPS players with no sense of humor who insist on blood and gore in every game.Other people with no sense of humor.People who lack the creativity to enjoy a sandbox game."

The MMO support is amazing, it really is. And with the release of the newest DLC, I can't wait to see what other epic idiocy they have added.  The game is rife with bugs, but really, that's what makes it what it is.

(Chicago bars require a time-investment, especially the old man bars, which are the best bars)I can't quite give it to the game over stopping by at a proper Chicago liquor store and throwing down a few more bucks for some damned excellent beer, however. Sidekick is like Sierra Nevada without the mistakes. Okay, that's an exaggeration. Sierra is like the Car's Greatest Hits album of beers but Sidekick is exceptional and very yummy.But seriously it's 5 bucks. You get an hour, maybe two, starting with  occasional laughs and fading to smiles and then maybe wondering a little bit if you should'na, yet somehow satisfied with the fact that at least The Question was answered. That is totally worth five bucks.This game is a cheap dirty thrill and advertised quite thoroughly as such. Absolutely a thumbs up unless you're one of those people who gets mad at obviously low budget Android games for not being Mass Effect 2."

Was talkin to some old wino about the state of gaming today and how its important to realise what makes a game good. He wasnt realy paying attention. He did mention the crop of odd sims that have been comming out in the past few years. I said ""yeah I hear farm sim is comming out with a mushroom content update"" jokingly. ""Haha well atleast there givin the people what they want"" the wino burped.We had a few more rounds. Tagged a few more  bars. I rambled on  about how a good story is not an excuse to put gameplay on the backburner. Came across some cool folks where our conversation reguarding odd sims grew new legs. Garry  and Will were game devs. They loved sims and silly sandbox games. They were talkin about this new game thats a parody of both.  ""Its called Goat Simulator"" Will said. ""Haha. Thats funny. Ill have to check it out when i get home"" and head towards the bathroomI walk in to the john and there was this wild chick in there wearing a pink boa, fishnets, and a red mohawk. ""The little girls room is out of order. Just had to powder my nose' she smiles. ""Wanna bump"" *sniff* as she finger nials a healthy healpng of white powder and points it at me.The next day or two were a mess. Time was a spiral of chaos. What happend? A deep feeling of dread overcame me.  Nightmares of past failures ""Did I realy beat Rambo the Video game?"" Why would I ever buy Bientôt l'été?!""  ""Gotta calm down""I thought. ""Maybe have a drink."" Got up out of this strange punk girls bed. There is blood on my clothes on the floor. Its not my blood. Whos blood is it?! I gotta get out of here!Her room was strange. Marron walls. Dark. Weird dolls with pearcings on dim lit shelves. Reminded me of the spider baby from Toy Story. Shes still asleep, bottle of wiskey open lying on the floor inches from her hanging  arm. I scramble to get my things. I take a cab back home. Offered to give the driver 50 bucks if he woldnt tell anyone about my bloody clothes. He knew the score.Im home. Oh Its so nice to be home! I throw my clothes in the trash and step into the shower. As I stand under the water I cant help but feel bothered by something, but what is it? I get out. Get dressed. Make some coffee. Sit down at my computer. Log in. Start browsing Steam.""Oh hey its that Goat Simulator game Will was talking about"". Watched trailer. ""Haha that looks silly"". ""10 bucks? I dont know about that"". ""Wait WTF?!'You already own Goat Simulator*Disclaimer*Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.In that moment it came back to me. All the nighmares, the dread, the deep regret, the rage, the madness, it all started with Goat Simulator. In my intoxicated state I bought a game that goes against everything that I stand for as a lover of video games. Someone might be dead because of my actions. I cant undo what I did that day but I can warn people of the risks there taking when they buy Goat Simulator.*Edit*This review is ment to parody the crazyness this game has caused in the  community over the past few days. I thought it was pretty clear but some folks have taken it the wrong way...somehow."

I get its just a fun game, but there are glitches everywhere, and not much to do. In my two hours of playtime, I have completed almost all the achievements and found all of the easter eggs. This game is short but fun. I would only get it if you plan to play in half an hour chunks."

The workshop items don't help at all, too. Also, this is way overpriced. I mean WAY... 10 FREAKING BUCKS? It should  be about 0.99-2.49 for the short gameplay. All I'm saying is that you are wasting money if you buy this. Please, PLEASE listen to my advice, and spend/save your money up for something good... like StarBound... or Garry's Mod... or even ( Ecleast it's better than this ) Crysis 2. Ok, never mind, forget that. Never buy Crysis 2 either, its fun for 20 minutes until you meet aliens, then they're too OP and impossible to kill. But my point is, is that everyone who says "" OMGZ SO LOL LOL LOL FLY GOAT OMG PEWDS PLAYED IT!!!!111 HAZ TOO B3 GOOD,"" are people that either (A : Just watched Pewds play it (or Markiplier) (B : Haven't actually played it but bought it, or (C Have a dumb sense of humor. If you look at most helful reviews, the people who ""Thumbs Up'd for Helpfulness"" Haven't even played the game yet, and they think it's good because Pewds played it. (BTW Wanna see how that cycle works? Check out Gametheory, they made an episode of how GS [Goat Simulator] became so popular and other stuff)Just press the button ""Only Negative"" in the review section, and then you'll change your mind. Trust me, its good for 12 minutes, then its boring. Its just ""BL0W UPZ GOAT, WUTCH POODEEPIE, BUY GAME, WUTCH POODIEPIE, PLAY GAME, CRY THAT YOU WASTED MONEY"". Thats the cycle of GS. Thank you for your time, and please do not buy this game. Thank you.And remember this for other games, so-called ""Bro's"", (BTW I dont hate pewdiepie, Im a bro too, but just not a stupid one) just because Pewds played, or any other youtuber played it, and they made you laugh, doesn't mean the game is funny. It just means the Youtuber is funny. So sure, hate on this review because of the ""OMFG DIS GUIY STOOPID, HE HATEZ PEWDIEPIE, I HATE HIM, DISLIKE 4EVAR BEETCH!!!!"", just dont buy the game. Maybe if It ever goes on sale for 2.49, but not for 10, not even 4.99. So please, get Hitman Absolution when it's on sale instead of GS, or get Sleeping Dogs, or Tomb Raider, or even Rust. But, I have some final notes for games you SHOULD BUY.Shouldn't:Turbo Dismount |OMFGGZ PWED PLAYZ IT, I LUVZ IT!!!Crysis 2 | Please God, I'd rather kill myself.|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Should:Any indie game, you may think it's stupid or unpopular, or not Pewd's worthy, but Sleeping Dogs was amazing. And I mean AMAZING.Broforce |One of the few games Pewds played that was good, not much gameplay, but awesomely fun, with all the updates.|Tomb Raider |Main Story is ok, but Multiplayer is awesome.Hitman Absolution |Lots of game play if you're a determined gamer to get acheivements, with awesome Campaign|Good bye everyone. Please vote yes on ""Helpful"", so I can spread the message."

Goat Simulator is fantastic proof that a game can be a masterpiece with only a goat and some clumsy physics to its name. It manages to be fun, engaging, and easy to pick up.It doesn't have a great amount of vanilla content, but what it does right is be a hilarious but brief distraction from those trivial real-world pressures of economic depression, global climate change, and the general total social breakdown of the modern world.I would rate it 75.5 goats up out of 13.

Would it be fun? Does it involve Will Smith? Does it have a story? When I first played it, I realized the answer to my questions: IT DOESN'T MATTER! The game was amazing, beautiful, and emotional. The setting was so undescribable, that to believe it, you would have to see it yourself. The character development was tear jerking, seeing the goat do things like [SPOILERS!] perform sacrifices, retrieve jetpacks, and ruin parties. The music was a masterpiece, and it sounded like it was made by Mozart. I had the freedom to do whatever I want, and there was nothing telling me I couldn't. After exiting the game to take a break, I burst into tears because of that goat. This game has a special place in my heart.also you can lick cars11 / 10"

Someone worked hard on a game to try and make it a quality product, and they were paid to make sure that glitches don't happen, but glitches happened anyway. That's why when a ragdoll gets stuck in a wall, or you randomly fall through the map, you can at least get a good chuckle out of it. It's like watching a professional racing pit crew forget to but gas in the car; It's funny because that sorta thing isn't supposed to happen, which means that someone messed up their job.You know what makes Goat Simulator's glitchesnotfunny? Because they were left there on purpose. Nobody eventriedto stop it. Hell, theyencouragedit. They left the glitches in because they're supposed to be'hysterical', but they're not funny because they'resupposedto be there.Sure they're adding new content, bringing more depth to the game, and there are actually parts of the game with good humor that can give you a smile, and parts of the game can even befun, I still have problems with the game. The biggest problems with the game are major bugs that even the devs want toactually fix. Bugs such as the game crashing, the game not exiting properly when you quit, causing it to run in the background, and the game deleting all of my progress I had for gathering collectibles.

The gameplay makes you want to squeeze every single ounce of fun out of the game each time you play it, and only to come back for more later. This game makes for either a fantastic time killer, for when you have no idea what game to play, or you are just generally bored.The Ragdoll physics almost make you want to burst out laughing at whatever occurs out of them, the random powers players can nab only adds to the hilarity [and again, so do the associated glitches the developers refused to resolve for a reason that is utterly clear to me].There are very few actual problems with this game which do slightly hinder it. The map, once you get past a certain point and especially with mutators on, seems uncomfortably small. The game would enjoy a lot more replayability if the standard map was expanded even by just an extra half of it's size. Of course, the game also has plenty more disastrous things that could be added to it, especially in the natural disasters department, particularly caused by goats.While there are plenty of things to play as or that modify your 'goat' [called mutators in the game], and while they each give the game a whole new perspective, the game seems to just scream for more. Chupacabras, parodies of actual characters, [Goat vader springs to mind as an example], the list goes on, but i have a good feeling the fan base of this game will be cutting some of that kind of work out for the developers.As for the origin of the game, and why Coffee Stain created it, these are not exactly clear to me, but this game is so addictive I just dont care. This is arguably the best 10 dollars I have ever spent. Just goes to show a game does not have to be expensive in order to be good."

,Not Recommended,265930,10041537,"Posted: 6 May, 2014",all,The Pseudo King,"I'm really not happy with this game.  I went in to this hoping to find an open world game with stupid physics, weird effects and just silly stuff in general.  While I did find all that I can't say it was enough to justify the $10 I spent on the game.The world in Goat Simulator is full of interesting stuff (""zero gravity"" chamber, a goat fight club and a place to sacrafice things to Satan, all hail the infernals name) but none of it held my attention for more that a second or two unless it was directly tied to getting an achievment.  Now, I'm not the type who achievment hunts just for bragging rights, no, I spent a good 40 minutes running around and trying to decide what to do when I realized I'd seen it all and gotten bored.  With nothing else to do I figured out how to get all the statues and where to jump from to catch the hang-glider and I still had barely 2 and a half hours of gameplay.  Not only was that not very long, but beyond the first half hour it wasn't even very fun.  Many of the achievments simply dont register, seemingly at random, and some of the harder ones require precise timing and jumping skill which the game can't offer.  One of the biggest problems with this game is how poorly its made, and I'm not talking about how unrealistic the physics are or calling the graphics bad, those were both features that charmed me.  I'm talking about the frame rate.  My computer can run most any modern game (Bioshock Inifinite, Skyrim, etc.) at 50 fps or higher without having to lower the graphics.  With Goat Sim I had to run it on the lowest graphical settings possible and I still couldn't get more than 30 fps when I was standing still, running around or interacting with anything often made it drop below 10.  So not only was I not having much fun, but my lack of fun wasn't even running well.  The two tracks in the game (at least I think there are two, its hard to tell) are actually completely tolerable even after listening to them for hours at a time which isn't to say they're good, they just don't make me verbally angry after listening to them more than once.All in all I can't say that this is worth getting, now I only have it for the novelty of saying, ""Yeah, I've got Goat Sim, wanna try it?"" and then watching someone play it for 15 minutes before they get bored, ask me why my computer can't handle something so simple and we move on to something better.  The game gets boring after a few minutes, it doesn't run well and asking $10 for it is as much a crime as highway robery.3/10  I flung my goat into a moving car while a woman was stuck to my tounge and our models fused into one, strangely sexual, goat-woman before my computer made a sad computer sound, crashed and gave me an achievment.  And that was my happiest moment"

And thats where I think this game delivers value for money, wait for it to drop on sale. Then move your computer out to the living room and pass a controller around with the katamari devil goat.

I finaly had found my nirvana to my neverending regrets and hell for me being into goats since I was 8. No therapist, clinic, or perscription could help me learn self respect and realization for my love in goats. I have now gone back into a univerity and am planning to get my masters degree in computer science all thanks to this game. It cleansed all of my thoughs of the kids beating me with a bag full of rocks in the stall, calling me goat boy. I now stand up proud with my hooves straight, for I will use my degree in computer science to work at Coffee Stain Studios and be as close to our allmighty goat god. So would I recommend this game? Yes. If you want to be cleaned of your past, if you want to have a daily escape from a living hell, and if you want to breathe again; buy this holy grail of games. Goat simulator saved my life."

The map includes a great many things for you to ♥♥♥♥ around with, including a castle with goat followers in it, a dried up pool with trampolines in it, a group of protesters, a goat version of Fight Club, a satanic ritual, a Zero Gravity Simulation area, a construction site, and even includes the office (which is actually just in a house) of the developers.

I could speak endlessly on the 1 to 1, next-gen of next-gen design.  Goat simulations so realistic you will feel compelled to eat every other goat simulator you own, and then post the resulting fecal deposits on Facebook.But no….what I want to touch on is the expert story.A touching plot that starts simple, as most do, but ends in such a tear jerking plot twist that you will go watch Lassie to calm down.  A tale so well woven than I actually forgot I was not a goat.  Sure my wife left me and all my furniture has bite marks in it, but that is the price.Without giving too much away it is the story of a goat in a small town.  Yes, it starts with the same story you have seen hundreds of times before in every pathetic goat game of the past.  Soon though you are thrust into a “Game of Thrones” like struggle for the crown and the undying acceptance from your peers.  Life and Death seem to swirl around the goat until he meet the love of his life only to find our SHE IS A RO….I am sorry…the tears……I can no longer see what I am typing.

Sometimes I just want to wreck house... as a farm animal. Goat Simulator is not a bad choice to fill that gap for cheap. In my eyes it’s a video game pallet cleanser- something silly and fun to play between intense games/sessions. Treat it as such and it'll serve you well. Go in with desire to 103% it or whatever and you'll leave empty, thinking you could have tossed that 10 USD (or equivalent) at another game."

However, I had already spent my money and was determined get its worth. As I continued to play, I found myself more and more immersed in the role. I soon realized that the life of a goat is not so clean and even. After all, one can't expect a creature whose primary means of interacting with the world is headbutting to be so constantly composed. I found the surface details easy to ignore once I'd managed to reach the top of the tallest structure from which I could look down on all the known world. While the contents of an entire house swirled around me as I headbutted, kicked, and licked, I had forgotten those vulgarities completely. Then that flurry somehow flung me out of the house and into the clouds. At that moment, I was the goat and it was ecstasy."

Well, it's certainly an improvement on Goat Simulator 2013 but is it ENOUGH of an improvement to warrant the iteration?--------------------------------------Okay, so this is in the vein of comedicly difficult to control games (I've only played Surgery Simulator of that genre). This has less challenge but also less rage since when you screw up (if you can really consider anything screwing up here) nothing bad happens. You are immortal and the whole thing is a goof. But it's funny with plenty of bits of little content hiding around. I think the sweet spot for price will be around $5 but I'm not sorry I bought it at $10 because I like to support some games like this with heart and a quirky sense of humor. Just read their description to get an idea of what that sense of humor is like BEFORE you buy the game.I think it's funny how if you look at metacritic you'll have a big split between those who see the game as brilliant and others who see it as crap. I'd say it's in between. It's nothing really new, nor is it particularly well executed, but it is a silly and funny game. Since it's not attempting to be anything different, I see no problem in that. I do agree that it doesn't have quite the amount of fun playtime as some other games in the area."

But I guess overall, I have to say no.It's meh. You get two hours of enjoyment out of it pretty much. I guess if you are absolutely bored and have nothing to do, it can pass some time since it doesn't really have a goal and you won't get sucked into it like other games, but can occupy you.Most of it's charm comes from it's references. Those are pretty much where all the humor comes from. Sure the physics may be silly, but it feels like there isn't enough to play around with to get enough laughs.The map is actually surprisingly small. I initially thought it would have more to do. You see a city in the backbround, but unfortunately, you can't got to it. That would have been a fun enviroment to play in, but unfortunately, it's just not part of the one map. Also, the developers put in houses that you CAN'T enter. There are only two houses you can enter: The one you spawn in front of, and the Coffee Stain Studios one. I just find it kind of stupid how you have a small map, and make it a tiny bit smaller by having useless un-enterable buildings.It's also sucks how the civilians are pretty much another object. In a game like GTA, it's fun to wreck havoc because there is a whole bunch of people and you can go on a blood thirsty rampage and watch the civilians flee. Then cops show up and try to kill you and you then have even more people and things to blow up. The civilians here are kind of few, and they just don't do much. They may make screams, but they don't really run away all that much.It also seems like it is a hog when it comes to CPU power. Unfortunately, I can't really say much on this, since I don't have a super expensive gaming rig, but apparently some people say they have a good gaming rig and they don't get as much framerate as they normally do. But still, I feel that hardly matters, since it seems like it's still playable even on my laptop, albeit it's on low settings.I do like how the developers capitalize on the fact that it endorses bugs. That is funny to see at first, but when you get down to it, it kind of ruins the gameplay a bit. If you see a funny stretchy body bug in something like Fallout or Halo or Gears of War, or most other games, it's funny too see because that is an unintended result, and things are funny to us when we don't expect it. But, when you get those spazzy body physics in this game, you know that's what the game intends and it just isn't that funny.It feels like this game is not worth 10$. Maybe more like 5$. But still, who knows. This game does have workshop, so maybe enough people can make fun and amusing maps to play on or some fun functions and features, and that can save this game. But of course, that is assuming that the people who are devent at making maps and what not don't get bored of this game to the point where they don't want to work on it anymore. But still, it doesn't matter so much to the developers. They already made a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money from this. It was advertised well and a lot of people boarded the hype train. I was one of the passengers. Now I am in a place I don't want to be and can't get my money back.TL;DR It's only worth half it's price, and it seems to be lacking in a lot of areas. Meh physics.   It sold well because of good advertising and hype. Can provide two hours of fun, and can possibly pass a short amount of time every so often if you need something to do or waiting for something."

Oops, horse pun.  Horses are not goats.Now for the serious review:  This game is very poorly optimized, so even with a good system there's no guarantee stuff will run well.  Half the objects in the world only appear when I'm about a centimeter in front of them.  That being said, if you can sort that out, it's fun for a bit.HOWEVER.  After about 20 minutes or so, you quickly run out of interesting things to do, and all the funny broken stuff ceases to be funny and just broken.  After all was said and done, I felt like the game was overpriced considering it's a broken ""parody.""Like a lot of people are saying, this seems to be have created with the purpose of baiting Youtubers for lolsy glitchiness, which doesn't really last."

A couple of days ago, and today, I tried to get on the game but couldn't. It says ""Preparing to launch Goat Simulator"" and then it never launches. I have a good computer (4 gigs of RAM, AMD Dual Core Processor E2-3000, and, according to Google®, my video card far surpassed the requirements) but it just stopped working. I am quite sad, however, because i've had this game for awhile and I payed $10 of hard-earned cash. I've tried going to the Steam forums and everything, but it just won't work. I'm very distraught over it. :("

76561197998825270,Not Recommended,265930,11917499,"Posted: 29 August, 2014",all,The Dorf,"I think there are pretty much two camps of people as it pertains to Goat Simulator. Those who think it's absolutely hilarious and those who get bored quickly while playing it and are slightly confused by the relative popularity of this game. I believe I fall in the latter camp. Just go watch some gameplay videos of Goat Simulator and you'll pretty much already know which camp you belong to without even having to play the game. I understand the humor though, and I get why people like the game. But the more I play Goat Simulator, the more I'm sure that I'm not this game's target audience.Goat Simulator was a product of an internal game jam at Coffee Stain Studios. Some early footage of a demo of Goat Simulator was released on YouTube and the demand for a full game to be produced was very high. Because, you know, it's the internet. A full version of Goat Simulator was then launched on Steam earlier this year on April 1st. No really, it was. It's kind of an interesting game. It's maybe one of the truest sandbox games ever made. There's absolutely no objective. The entire gameplay of Goat Simulator relies on creating emergent humor through its admittedly broken physics engine. Have you ever been killed by a giant in Skyrim and seen this? Or seen the bizarre physics glitches in the FIFA or GTA games? The developers intentionally left these kinds of glitches in the Goat Simulator physics engine for comedic effect. And that's pretty much the game, just messing around with the physics engine in the game world. There is a scoring system similar to ones found in the old Tony Hawk skating games where points are awarded for doing various skating tricks. There's also some mini-missions and subquests, but it's pretty much just Messing Around: The VideogameThe aforementioned physics glitches in the Elder Scrolls, FIFA or GTA games are funny because they are unexpected and bizarre variations on our expectations of how the game should behave. In all of those games, there is (arguably) some semblance of realism or at least the attempt to make physics objects behave as they would in the real world. That's not really the case with Goat Simulator. I feel that the intentionally programmed physics bugs in Goat Simulator lose some of their comedic value because, while they still look ridiculous, they are completely expected by the player. You're not really expecting to headbutt a human NPC and have him just fall over. You expecting him to skyrocket unrealistically off into the horizon. And always having this constant expectation of humor somewhat diminished the comedic impact for me. I was almost disappointed when crazy stuff didn't always constantly happen while I was galavanting around in the game world.If you're looking for an open ended, goofy sandbox game with ludicrous physics, Goat Simulator is your game. I didn't really enjoy it, but I'm also aware that this kind of game is not for me. It's obviously loved by its fans though, as it has tons of gameplay videos of ridiculous stuff on YouTube. I think a recent patch for the game added a couch co-op mode, which is cool. This is definitely the kind of game you'd want to share with friends.For more game reviews, check outhttp://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/"

I mean, there is very little to do and the appeal of playing as a goat wore off quickly. Everything tries too hard to be funny and it just doesn't work for me. The shock factor wears off from one gag to the next. The physics glitches happen way too often and they're not funny in the slightest. The complete lack of ability to set things up and see what happens ruined this game for me. Something I enjoy is seeing the outcomes of what I do remain and affect the things around me without being reset after 15 seconds.This game doesn't mock bad simulators, it IS a bad simulator."

Whilst it’s far from the bug laden, glitch filled adventure that many touted it as the core game mechanics are still fun with the added benefit of a whacky physics engine just adding to the mix. It’s a short lived adventure however as whilst it’s fun to rack up a high score there’s nothing really to keep you interested once the achievements are gone and you’ve played with all the powers. If the idea piqued your interest then I definitely recommend grabbing it but otherwise you’re not really missing out on anything if you decide not to play it.Read my full review here:http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/04/11/goat-simulator-prepare-for-my-bleaty-wrath/"
