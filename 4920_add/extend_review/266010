,Recommended,266010,9513244,"Posted: 17 March, 2014",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"Puzzle games in my eyes need a few things to be entertaining, addicting tests of your wits. They should be easy to pick up, with basic rules that don’t require lengthy tutorials or wordy instructions to understand. They ought to be dynamic, built on a framework that can be easily reworked into a continual stream of interesting puzzles that don’t become repetitive despite being similar if not identical in design. And lastly I prefer them to be easy to pick up and put down, like a coffee table book that you can spend a few minutes or hours passing the time with, then set it back down for an unknown amount of time and still find it just as enjoyable the next time you look at it.LYNE seems to have unknowingly looked into my head and designed itself around these ideals, forming into a simple but exemplary brain teaser that I fell in love with from the very first screen. It’s a relaxing yet engrossing experience that excels at putting you in a zen like state as you clear puzzles and feel especially clever each and every time you do.In essence, LYNE can best be thought of as a nonlinear connect-the-dots. You’re given two points that you must connect, while going through all of the requisite points between them, but the order in which you do so is entirely up to you. There isn’t necessarily only one way to solve a puzzle, and this freedom is but one reason I find LYNE hugely refreshing compared to so many other puzzle games. As you progress you begin to deal with multiple colors, points you must repeatedly run through, and more complex designs that have you connecting lines like a mad cartographer, which from the outside looking on would seem highly complex and difficult.But, it never feels that way when you’re playing. The fundamentals are so basic that it feels almost innate, like you’ve already been doing this for years. Something about LYNE clicked with me instantly, allowing me to breeze through level after level without an abundance of difficulty but leaving that satisfying feeling of accomplishment when you flex your frontal lobe and solve a problem. The soothing ambient sounds and mellow colors do well to elicit a calm mindset, making this an ideal way to let loose of your tension and unwind as you focus on the problem at hand.In a similar way that many treat Sudoku and crossword puzzles, LYNE has something of a habitual quality; something you can go back to every day to help keep you sharp and relax after the more trying events of a day. The structure is tailor made for this style of play, with puzzles grouped into sets that are just long enough to be rewarding but not fatiguing. Random daily puzzles (though you’d never know that do to them being just as well designed as the base sets) provide consistent new content, at which point I can think of little more I could ask for.Brilliant, Thomas Wowker, brilliant.You can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

Well it was that and puzzle games tend to be more miss than hit with me.  It went on sale (today actually) for 89 cents and I decided there was nothing to lose.Right away I noticed this game suits me well.  It is very relaxing and easy to jump in and out of.  The puzzles, while they can be tough, are not brain burners, so you can play them after an exhausting day at work and just zone out.  There's also enough to keep you busy for a while.  There are 26 sets with 25 puzzles in each set, which comes out to 650 puzzles to solve.  Not to mention 2 more sets of daily puzzles.  I am almost at three hours in and I already solved 6 sets and today's 2 dailys.  I've noticed that the further in you get, the harder they become.  Still I haven't found myself getting close to frustrated at all and that is a huge plus for me.For these reasons I recommend this game.  I am going to jump back in and get back to the fun."

Something to waste time clicking along. Oh wow was I wrong! Yes it is casual in so far that there is no urgency to finish the level but it's not simply a time waster. At one point I can swear I was one with the game seeing the combinations appearing in front of my all by themselves. (no I do not use experience enhancing substances - some chocolate and that's it). Great music and very addictive game play. I am so glad I bought this little gem of a game. I have friends who like puzzles. Dudes buy this! Like now.

Apart from the multi-nodes, it's always the same idea, and there's no new mechanic involved further on.Sure, there's a lot of hand-crafted levels, which is usually a good point in puzzle games, but for LYNE, it felt like it was a bittoomuch. It seems like you're always trying to solve the same level over and over on the long run, and I even noticed some of them being exactly the same, except rotated in a different manner.Now, I'm not saying LYNE isn't worth it. If you're just looking for a puzzle game to kill some time, without being afraid of the ""assembly-line work"" feeling of it, then just go ! The minimalistic art style is fantastic, and you can even chose your colour palette, which I appreciated a lot.If I was to be honnest, I don't think that game is that interesting on a computer, you might prefer playing LYNE on your phone/tablet whenever you feel like it.If you expect diversity, this might not be for you, but it remains a nice little puzzler overall !"

,Recommended,266010,10063137,"Posted: 9 May, 2014",all,♫Quilly Shiba,"This game is simple. So simple, that the answer for every puzzle is right there even if I was unable to see it. There's no hidden mechanics, no tricks. It's brutally honest, beautifully so. When I couldn't figure something out, I left it for a bit, then came back after a day - sometimes it would just pop out right at me then.This game is so relaxing, I think I did learn a thing or two about myself along the way. In higher levels they sure get complex, and it was still relaxing! When you draw the lynes it felt like doodling, albeit very symmetrically, in all the game's stark simplicity.I love this game, I could not put it down. I think it's definitely worth getting if you're interested in puzzle games that you can play on and off, without giving you pressure (while becoming increasingly difficult). The ending almost made me tear up a bit. If you've finished all the level sets, there are new, randomly generated levels of varying difficulty every day so it's endless.I should try getting into the ciphers I've been hearing about too."

,Recommended,266010,9936495,"Posted: 25 April, 2014",all,Aussiedroid,"The concept of LYNE is so simple that you will learn it watching the store page video or playing for first few puzzles, yet as you progress through the tier sets (which contain a massive 650 puzzles!), this simple concept turns into some very complex puzzle scenarios. Larger game grids, more colours/lines to connect or three-way instead of two-way blocks are some modifiers used throughout to increase the difficulty each set. Once you get into the second half of the game there are some real challenging levels that will leave you scratching your head for a long time (& occasionally swearing at your monitor)!To give you an example, here is some unedited footage of me trying to solve a more challenging level (mistakes and all!):http://youtu.be/7FUkr6AqzlQGraphics are clear, mouse controls are intuitive, achievements & cards, and also has daily set challenges of randomly generated puzzles to test you further. The daily sets, plus the 650 standard puzzles is a huge amount of content for such a small price tag.There really isn't any negatives to this great little puzzle game, although if I was to be picky some of the colour pallette sets are abit hard on the eyes:) Thankfully, not a big deal as you can set it to your liking once you unlock pallettes through game progression.If you like games that challenge your mind (& sometimes your sanity!) then LYNE is well worth checking out.If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"

I mean or you'd just be disregarding my entire review, which is fine too.Exactly what is this game?Puzzle game, you draw lines, you learn the patterns you play challenges and you just unlock new themes, there are hundreds of levels and probably thousands because of the daily challenges which are selected from a pool of a... lot.The dimensions of this game involve drawing lines through points that require up to 4 entries in order to be activated and moving 3 different lines through every point on the board to the other side.It is a lot more difficult than one might think at first and has an amazingly good learning curve, like it felt like I was naturally moving through the game at a very nice pace, and I was learning the best ways to complete puzzles, which do have multiple answers.So now the standard game rating:Story: 0/10(Simply put there is none, but it's a puzzle game, not every one is equipped with a cheesy story to go along with why you're figuring out puzzles.)Gameplay: 10/10 + 📱(addictive, smooth, aesthetic, and highly mobile are ways to describe it, I would suggest getting this on a phone though.)Presentation: 10/10(A minimalist design with a changing theme, and it's always smooth, the game just looks and feels great.)Soundtrack: 7/10(by no means is it a bad sound to the game, however there is no soundtrack and you get a hovering highlight sound everytime you connect a line, but thats all, it's still very smooth and relaxing though and it doesn't get annoying.)Replayability: 10/10(Perfect on the go puzzle game.)"

Each day there'll be one to three different sets of twenty-five levels to solve. This unique set can be unlocked only after the second set of alphabet is completed.

There are plenty of color pallets to chose from but they needed to be unlock first.There thirty-three achievement for this game.

The music score is soothing. The game concept is based on connecting the dots except that it also features color based strokes/ paths and a single stroke is needed to fill each color. The strokes cannot overlap or cross each other. You need to find a path to connect all the boxes of each of the color codes.This is definitely a challenging puzzle otherwise it would have been dull and boring. It's hard but worry not because the pace and learning curve builds up smoothly as you easily navigate few levels in each 'set'. There are as many sets as there are alphabets in the English language.

The game also includes Daily sets which are randomly generated but need to be completed for the particular day.You gain skill points as you progress through the sets.

,Recommended,266010,17826794,"Posted: 1 September, 2015",all,Jadarma,"OverviewLYNEis a simplistic, minimalist puzzle game in which you must draw lines in order to conect the colored dots in each level, passing through each a defined number of time and not crossing other lines. The concept is simple, and the execution elegant and the final product represents a great casual game for the bored.The Pros:Loads of Levels!- There are close to 1000 levels to be completed - a set of 25 levels for each letter of the alphabet. Each set has it's theme, such as number of colors, number of nodes and the size of the matrix.Great Design- Vectorised graphics, bright colors, ability to unlock and apply color themes, seamless transitions through levels and an intuitive menu. This game looks and feel gorgeous.Relaxing- This is a great casual timekiller that you can pop in every now and then. The music is calming, the gameplay smooth and nobody rushes you.Random Daily Sets!- Finished the game and feeling you need more levels? Don't worry! Every day you get a randomly generated pair of sets for you to complete!The Price- Without discount, you can get this game for the modest price of 2,99Euros, which is great considering the ammount of levels you can get out of this thing.Achievements- Just as a bonus, the achievements unlock as you complete sets, and are each a letter. If you have an achievement showcase, you can write words with your acomplishments and it seems to be really popular among LYNE owners.The Cons:Repetitive- The game runs out of new game mechanics early, as it presents them to you in the first sets, and then it's just a combination of those in the rest of the game. Which isn't a bad thing, but it means that this game is best enjoyed in small sessions, as doing many levels at once can prove to become boring.Conclusion:If you enjoy a good puzzle game and a casual experience that looks and feels like a quality program, don't hesitate to grab this one off the ""shelf"", especially considering the small price tag.

The levels difficulty range from very simple to very challenging and there are 650 pre-made levels plus 25-75 daily levels - and that's a lot. There is no timer or any hidden distractions - you can focus on just solving the puzzle.The visuals and audio are quite nice. Large objects with contrasting colors, no music and simple sound effects. It looks pretty simple, but you realize it's all very well designed with focus on a relaxing experience.This is obviously not an AAA title nor a game you would play for many hours straight. But as a relaxing, casual game LYNE is a masterpiece on par with Windows Solitaire ;)"

And I can say for a fact that I’m addicted to this game. LYNE just became my favorite puzzle game because of the addicting test it presents to you. The objective of LYNE is simple but very challenging, especially as you progress deeper into the levels. Connecting three different shapes using patterns and color coding seems simple right? So, why not give it a try. The price is very fair and worth the time to give it a try. Plus as an added bonus, the game releases daily puzzles which are awesome once you complete the game and still have the desire play more."

The dailies are randomly generated each day, giving you access to two to three sets (that's 50 to 75 puzzles) on top of the others.

On a game with 95% review score?Well, as nice as this game may be, there are a few problems that make me not recommend it to others.1. Lack of varietySure, it has 500 levels. But after 50 or so, you've seen everything. Sure, there may be nodes witheven moreconnections, but it's more of the same, really. The level set names are also quite un-inspired, and the achievements maybe even more so. Also, the unlockable themes are not that much of a novelty either.2. Not learnableThe gameplay itself has a problem too though. It's not learnable. There's not really a way to ""become good"" at this game. Solving levels is merely a case of trying many combinations until you hit the right one. There's a lot of trial and error. Trial and error is usually bad, and I don't see why it's good here.3. Lack of sense of fulfillmentThe third problem is the level solutions themselves. They're too abstract, and don't resemble anything, and after a while, all levels look the same at first glance. Solving a level just doesn't give me that feeling of accomplishment that other puzzles can. When you solve a nonogram, at least you end up with a nice pixel art picture. Here it's just connected shapes - for all levels. It's all a bit too similar.Also, someone could probably write an algorithm to solve these puzzles. :)The game sure has its positives though. I like the minimalist look-and-feel, and I think the font choice and color usage are brilliant. Also it's easy to pick-up and play; it hardly requires a tutorial. It's also a nice original idea to toy around with. It's not a bad game. Certainly not! It's just, well, ...not much more than meets the eye?And it's not overpriced. For 3 dollars it's hard to be disappointed. So sure, pick it up if you think you like it. Just don't expect miracles :)"

,Not Recommended,266010,32400028,Posted: 13 June,all,changarid,"Lyne is a puzzle game inspired by the Nine-dot problem. The game introduces multiple lines  with separate sets of target dots distinguished by different colors. As anothre addition, there are vertices at which the lines are allowed to cross. While the original puzzle is a nice demonstration of insight problem-solving and out-of-box thinking, solution of Lyne puzzles does not involve either of these. Rather the solution is achieved by an exhaustive and often random exploration of the tree of all possible states. The difficulty is increased by asking the player to solve puzzles with deeper and wider trees.The controls are lacking: It is possible to modify the line that has been drawn only at its end. If you want to modify a segment of line at where it started, you need to redraw the entire line. That's not a big deal with small puzzles but it can get annoying with more longer lines.The game is intended for screens with portrait rotation - i.e. screens with height>width. Such choice is awkward since most displays are intended for landscape viewing and, for instance, it's not feasable to physically rotate laptop screen or a projector display.  As a consequence some slim puzzles will occupy 1/8 of the width of your screen when viewed in landscape mode and it can get really tricky to accurately draw the desired line.It appears that the game partly gets its current overwhelming rating due to the attractivity of its achievements. Achievements aside, I don't think the game deserves such rating. I don't recommend it."

The first few sets will teach you how to play, then the ever-increasing difficulty and complexity will provide a nice challenge for you to tackle at your own pace. Solving the more advanced sets is extremely satisfying, as you will often be required to experiment, think outside the box and come up with new solutions that you hadn't envisioned before. The 26 base sets are nicely complemented by daily challenges of varying difficulty, perfect for a break between harder puzzles or just to keep enjoying the game after you've finished it.

This is an intriguing puzzle game, with actual puzzles, you don't walk around and move objects to opens doors and stuff like other puzzlers, in this one it is like a simulation with nifty graphics. The aim of the game is to connect all objects together, and you can't leave any untouched.The game consists of 26 levels, each letter of the english alphabet is a level. Each level consists of 25 puzzles. All up you will end up completeing 650 different puzzles. But thats not it, there are also daily challanges with can have from 1 to 3 puzzles, some are harder than others.The game may seem easy at first, but as you get to higher level letters it can get rather challanging. As you get to higher levels you will get harder puzzles, this means you will get more variety of different colours, different grey ones requering more numbers, and a bigger amount of shapes. It can get rather challanging at the higher levels.You can finish the game anywhere from 10-15 hours, but of course it all depends on how good you are at this game. The achievments in this game are quite unique, everytime you finish a letter you will get an achievment which is that letter, so you can spell words and stuff on your profile in the achievment tab things, its pretty cool.This game is pretty cool, its challanging, cheap... what more could you want, my final verdict is a 9/10"

So I bought it (at the moment 1,99€ at Steam)The gameplay is easy, you click & hold at the first main symbol (these with border & filling) and lead the way to the other main symbol of the same kind. Done. You can not cross a way twice. Thats the main idea, kind of like the old game most of you played in school ""Dots & Boxes"". As probably every game in this world, it get's harder and harder from level to level. After 25 Levels you gain a triangle and finished the sets just to unlock another one.If you unlocked all sets, don't worry, after set B you unlock the ability to play daily sets. Every day you will get new sets with random difficulties to play and win.ReviewDesign:I love the design. It is simple and clean, very interesting and smooth to watch. Sadly this game does not support HD/Full-HD on PC, so that some of the athmosphere gets lost. Also it's kind of unsharp in the fonts sometimes7/10Music & Audio:The music theme of the game at all is awesome and relaxing. The sounds when you finish a level are great and make you happy, so you get addicted in unlocking more levels. The variety of the music is sadly pretty small and the sound of the symbols when you pass them sound like if someone is blowing into a bottle of Coca Cola and gets annoying after a while.6/10Gameplay & Addiction:Clearly it is a very great gameplay if you love that kind of ""strategy"" games. It combines oldschool elements with some new interesting features. Also the veriety of levels and the daily feature is great. Sometimes the balance of the levels is pretty uneven, as example Level B18 was super hard while the next few levels where pretty easy. Fix the balance a little bit ande this would be amazing9/10Cost-Benefit Equation & resumé:If you plan to play this game on the computer I can just highly recommend you this game. But!: Be aware, if you look for some super sexy time killer, you will just get pleased in the time killer part, 'cause the fact that this game is not HD/Full-HD is very sad, 'cause the pretty design gets lost in unrendered and unsharp fonts. Still every little design element is perfectly planned through and don't hurt your eyes at all.For the cheap price of 2.99€ (1.99€ in sale at the moment!) you get more than you can ask. Sell some of your useless DotA2/TF2/CS:GO stuff and buy this game.Thank you! If you like this review, you can feel free to add me on Steam"

It becomes pretty frustrating when you can’t figure something out and you just want it to end. It presents itself nicely and allows you the option to change the pallet of the game, customizing it to how you like the visuals. This can make it easier on the eyes at points especially if you are playing at night.I feel like if I had played this differently I would give this a better score. The problem I think this game has it that it is overly long. If it had been only about 10 stages long, I think it would be better. The puzzles are just repetitive and you really end up hating it. The colour pallets are terrible (Despite what I said above) and add nothing to the game at all. It just overstays its welcome. 4/10."
,Recommended,266010,22081178,"Posted: 27 March, 2016",all,Proxykon,"LYNE is an abstract, challenging puzzle game. Connect different shapes from start to finish in order to complete a level.Design & ArtThe design of the game is kept simplistic, basic shapes and a background. Overall the visuals are appealing for a puzzle game, kept basic on intention, because a puzzle game does not really need good graphics.Animations feel fitting and even help you out in some cases (see ""gameplay"" for more info).ControlsLYNE is controlled by mouse. The game gives your an understandable introduction tutorial on how to complete the puzzles.Sound & MusicA soundtrack does not actually exist. It is more like a shallow and eerie electronic synth playing some notes in the background. The soundeffects are nice, but could get repetitive if you play this game for too long. The option to turn the sounds off is available.GameplaySimply put, LYNE is a game consisting of 27 sets á 25 puzzles waiting to be completed. While you start fairly easy, it will get very difficult in later sets. The goal for every puzzle is the same: Connect both of the same shapes with each other by drawing a line between them. You drag the shapes in order to draw the connection. But it is not that easy: Later on, you will need to connect additional shapes with the same line or even multiple shapes at the same time. Another rule is that the connecting lines cannot cross each other. A little animation will hint you, if you try to make that mistake.Besides the alphabetical sets, there is a daily rotation of random puzzles. The rotation starts on easy on mondays and will get progressively higher in difficulty throughout the week. The weekend will use mixed difficulties.An option to change the colors of the game is available, if you gather enough triangles scores for solving sets or daily puzzle sets.WeakpointsWhile LYNE has an actual learning curve, some of the puzzles seem really hard, sometimes trail-and-error was the last resort for me. I rather enjoy games that can be completely solved either through process of elimination or through finding creative solutions, hence I had some times where I put the game down for some time.Also, be aware that this is a puzzle game and thus does not have much additional content. After you completed the main sets, there isn't much left to do besides fulfilling the daily tasks.There only exist certain color schemes, a complete color modification would be much nicer in my opinion.Also, while playing this on different machines, I noticed that your progress and score is saved locally, meaning if you have a laptop and download this game on said laptop while you already played LYNE on your home PC, then your score and progress in the alphabetical sets will NOT transfer.Concluding ThoughtsLYNE is a little but nice, time consuming, challenging but fair puzzle game. The visuals are intentionally kept basic, in order to conform with the gameplay, which is clearly in the foreground here. While the game can look boring and bland, do not let yourself get fooled, this game is one of the teeth-gnashingly types. I can safely recommend this game for yours truly puzzle solver out there. Happy solving!"

Each stage is like an abstract representation of a sensitive social topic, which you, the candidate had to satisfy and solve. By navigating the treacherous waters of political intricacy, you have to meet the demands of various interest groups, whether they are reasonable or not, while avoiding to contradict yourself in logic.Once you have completed the first leg of your tour, fulfilling the easy ball questions, you will advance gradually to the national theatre. Now, not only are there more interest groups per subject, but their demands ever more outrageous than the last. You will have to employ every deceitful tactic to advance, double talking to your audience, introducing false equivalency into every debate to confuse the masses, making sure your support base are all too occupied with double think to see your wacky logic. All eyes on you as the media broadcast your every road trip and every “achievement”.When you have sneaked and snided your way to presidency, gaining the support of 26 states (chapters) and obtaing the votes of 650 territorial delegates (stages), you will have the pleasure of tackling the day to day operation of the country, taxing your mind evermore with the daily happenings of the world (daily puzzles).Such a campaign by the political veterans should take around 10 hours to complete, though if you are willing to cheat like a real politician, it can take as little as 2 hours.

I will still reccomend it, though, it is a really good game that is not too expensive even when it's not on sale.So what's the good things besides the achievements? The simple concept of connecting shapes, or dots if you want over all the letters in the alphabet  plus extra levels that changes every day (Daily), and a nice bonus that you can change the colour pallette of the background and the shapes. 25 levels per letter set will keep you entertained(or frustrated) throughout the hours, days, week... depending on how fast you complete. There are excellent guides however should you get stuck somewhere. Also, a huge plus for the silence; no annoying music, just the occasional sounds when you connect lines and makes it to the next level.The only downside is the later letter sets when you get the same colour and shapes on every level, sometimes it gets a bit monotonous to do a lot at once. It's getting better once you are closer to the end, though.Looking at both sides of the games, it is a really good one and well worth its price so get it whether it's on sale or not. Not much bad aside from above, either and if those would have had a bit more variety I would probably make huge shoutouts about getting it. Do get it however."

The letter achievements are worth the time spent completing the game (there are lots of guides on level completion) as they open up so many new customization possibilities on your profile's achievements showcase.

There's not a whole lot to say about this game other than it is very comparable to the phone game ""Flow"", but with way more advanced mechanics than Flow.But the thing is, such a simple puzzle game is just a cover up for an insane cryptography puzzle the developer put in the game as a bonus.

Especially after you look to see how many you have left, finish an entire letter's set, only to see the next letter's set has just as many. ;-;I personally don't think this game works well for pc, it's better as an app for mobile devices. Its length and casual play style is perfect for when you've got a couple of minutes to spare. The visuals of the game also led to a boring feeling, as it's just a couple of shapes. Otherwise the settings were great, the game allowed me to play in windowed mode. So I could more or less multitask while playing this game. There's even a daily challenge sort of mode that, if I'm understanding correctly, unlocks sets of letters at random. So you wouldn't have to play through all of the letters in order.So to reiterate, I don't recommend playing this game on pc unless you're an:*achievement hunter that wants to make words out of the achievement letters.*or a gamer heavily into ""difficult"" puzzles.But I do recommend this game as an app. These are actually the types of time wasters I look for on my ipod."

Although it’s quite restricted in its gameplay, the combination of the polished, intuitive interface, conciliating, dynamic audio and simple concept makes this one of the best casual games available on Steam.As you progress further into the game, the puzzles increase in difficulty and complexity, thus, players will ultimately resort to the drawing board on several puzzles. However, even though it’s very limited in terms of its variety, the game never felt tedious or mundane and I was able to appreciate the challenging, yet addictive nature of LYNE, whilst simultaneously solving the ingeniously designed puzzles.Even after completing all the achievements and unlocking all the colour palettes there isn’t really anything to stop you from playing this puzzler. With the addition of 50+ daily puzzles, this game also serves as a pleasurable mental exercise and I would be lying if I said my analytical thinking skills haven’t improved since experiencing LYNE.

There are 650 premade levels (26 ""chapters"" with 25 levels each) but almost all of them feel more or less the same. If you're waiting for a movie to download, then it's a pretty good game to get a level or two in, but it's definitely not a game that you sit down and play for hours, or even 30 minutes, before you're feeling bored.I would've glady traded 500 of those 650 levels for some new gameplay mechanics over time. The existing mechanics are fine, but variety is the spice of life and this game got bland real quick.BreakdownProsBang-for-your-buck: You get a huge amount of levels to play, and you technically get infinite replayability since there are daily new levels.ConsSSDD: The game really doesn't get more interesting time.Score: 4/10 — Would only really recommend picking it up on sale."

Graphics are just lines and soft, solid colors, which works well here, as do the equally soft and minimal musical sound effects.

You click on the beginning block of a certain color, and drag a path to the finishing block.

I only got a couple hours of fun out of it since it's incredibly redundant, but if you're bored or want to exercise your brain a little bit, LYNE isn't a bad place to start. It has a very simplistic and sleek design, which isn't hard on the eyes."
,Recommended,266010,18210666,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,JacquesLeSauve,"Now THIS is how you make a puzzle game! Both elegant in its simplicity and devious in its complexity, LYNE is a beautiful blend of pick-up-and-play accessibility and fair, reasonable challenge that pretty much never punishes and only rewards. I'm not sure of the exact terminology of every element of the game, so I'm just going to have to wing it and hope it all makes sense...The easiest way to probably explain it is to say it's a game of join the dots. There are three main coloured shapes, or nodes, scattered across a gridded board, green triangles, red squares and blue diamonds (at least by default, the colour palette can be unlocked and changed throughout the game), with a start and end point for each shape. The object being to drag a line that joins each point whilst also passing through all the faded out nodes of the same shape. So the green line can only pass through the faded green nodes, and so on. There are also neutral nodes that any line can pass through which act as intersections for the different coloured lines. With the exception of these neutral nodes, each node can only be passed through once, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, and a line can never cross through another line. So, basically, connect each start and end point, and fill in the board along the way. As with most puzzle games, it can sound way more complicated in writing than it really is, but within thirty seconds of actual play you'll perfectly understand exactly how the whole thing works.The game's first triumph is in teaching itself to the player. With the way it introduces each element of play, the only actions you'll be able to perform are the ones it wants you to learn, further reinforced by brief phases of repetition and minor variation. It won't take long for the series of light bulbs to come on over your head with each new method of covering the board that you learn and you'll soon find yourself steamrolling your way through the opening few stages.There are 26 sets of puzzles corrosponding to each letter of the alphabet, with each set containing 25 individual puzzles for a total of 650... yeah, you read that right, 650 puzzles. On top of that there are also random daily sets, but unless I'm mistaken, they at least appeared to me to be a mix of various puzzles from the main sets. It's hard to say how long it takes to complete, given that each player will spend a vastly different amount of time depending on their personal skill level, but I reckon about 30 hours would be a reasonable guess, give or take a few hours.What I really love about this game is how success or failure rests solely in the hands of the player's own determination. With no time limit and no way to technically lose (you either finish a puzzle or you walk away from it), the game is a test of perseverance more than anything. There are a few tricks you can learn to criss-cross your way around a board, but really you'll have to poke and prod at everything and experiment with different routes before honing in on the solution. But rarely will the game leave you hanging, and it'll usually hint as to where you should at least start before working your way out, and from there on it's a gradual process of elimination. It also helps that many puzzles will have multiple methods to solve them, so there is some flexibility in play.Topping everything off is a slick, clean aesthetic that's minimalist but still appealing. I wasn't a massive fan of the audio as the pinging chimes gradually grated against me and I instead opted to play my own music in the background the entire time, but that's a very minor gripe given how it doesn't really serve any fuctional role in the game play and you can easily live without it. But what I was a massive fan off was the price which is the sweet little cherry on top that should be the final nudge to any fence-sitters still not entirely sure whether or not they should pick this up. Protip, you should."

I have to be TOTALLY honest with you: At first... JUST AT FIRST, I bought this game so I could spell out something on the acheivement showcase, but then, I found out this game is very fun, and its one of those semi-educational games that amuses you just as much as an RTS or a FPS. Once you first buy it, it may seem very ""the same"" each time, but hey, Angry Birds got millions, didn't they? This is very different to Angry Birds so don't get offput or overexcited by that statement, this is a simple, lovable puzzle game, not a jigsaw puzzle game or a Strategy Puzzle Game like Tropico or anything, just a well made, simple little game that you can get stuck into for ages, to be honest I haven't, at least right now, while I'm writing this review I've so far only played for about 22 minutes, but I can tell you, I will play for much longer.

It is a feat rooted in simple and intuitive design, a form which conjures the thought that, surely, someone must have had the idea already.Thomas Bowker's LYNE does exactly this. And, no matter how hard we wrack our brains, we can't think of another game that does what it does. Or, at least, none that do it as well.As the name suggests, the simple goal of LYNE is to draw a continuous line that links shapes of the same type together.The basic grid pattern upon which the puzzles play of allow for movement along the eight ordinal directions. To complete each stage, you simply trace the desired line between each point. The only initial complication is that you can't visit the same shape twice, or allow lines to overlap.The game's minimalist visual design, and panpipe soundtrack, provide a meditative feel to these early puzzles. But it doesn't take long for LYNE to completely destroy this illusion of calm"

The game is surprisingly challenging. During my average play session I was usually able to clear 6-7 puzzles before I got stuck and had to take a break. It was satisfying to get stuck on a puzzle and then come back to it the next day and solve it immediately. Like most video games, LYNE gets more difficult as it goes on, and the final set of boards is a real challenge. I usually played in the morning, listening to podcasts instead of the game sound.

The aim is to link figures of the same colour drawing an unique line that can't cross the lines that belong to other colors. Design is simple, but absolutely cool, based on geometry and soft colors. As for the music, I didn't like it this much. You can complete it within 8-10h maybe. Once you get the first levels, you ""learn"" the way it works and it's pretty much the same from one level to the next one. This makes the game a bit repetitive, so playing it all at once could get boring. For me, it looked like one of those games for your smartphone brought to the computer. Anyway, it's a good deal if you get it with a discount. May entertain you sometimes for playing without Internet, design is good, you can replay it as much as you want and it gives you gorgeous letters in the achievements that you can use to customize your Steam profile."

It's tremendously relaxing but never to the point of putting you to sleep, which some other minimalism inspired puzzlers have been guilty of in the past. Instead, it launches new rules at you through obvious steps, expecting you to flow along with them and disregard the difficulty ramp which climbs higher after each 'set' of puzzles completed. Not to ruin the experience, but you won't notice the change in pace. You'll grow with the game and find your skill improving as the game evolves through mechanics.With that said, it boasts a set of 25 levels for each letter of the alphabet and rewards you with new skins to play the game in... and it's enough. Finally a puzzle game that doesn't feel the need to bombard you with needless 'powerups' for completing level 57 in under a certain time. No, LYNE does something much better and allows you the freedom to explore the puzzles, learn the bits and pieces and relax all at the same time. If you like puzzle games, this is fantastic. If your interests lie with more expansive games that take a good 400+ hours to complete, then LYNE is certainly a great way to wind down at the end of the day.Simple gaming, just like the good ol' days - 9/10"

When describing the game, by saying that you're trying to connect two end points and travel through nodes a particular amount of times, it sounds like it would be boring. The game is designed in such a way that it's so polished and plays so smooth, that it makes that simple idea fulfilling.It's a great way to waste 15 minutes here and there, and there are 550 levels (25*26), and they can be completed in less than 10 seconds, or stump you for a while. You are fortunately able to work on any of the 25 levels at a time, based on what stage (letter of the alphabet) you've gotten to, so that you aren't necessarily going to be stuck on 1 level with nothing else to play. The downside is that you have to wait to beat stage A to get to B, B to get to C, and so forth.The game did go a bit downhill after taking a little too long to boost the difficulty up, and it did feel like it went from medium to hard in a single jump from stage S to stage T (at least in my opinion). I'm now working on stage V and the puzzles tend to take >1 minutes each. I feel like stage T onwards are where this game shines, and it's a shame you have to beat a fair amount of easy puzzles to get there, but that wouldn't stop me from recommending the game."

Graphics are pretty much just lines and abstract shapes. Even achievements are nothing but letters :D This is not a bad thing, everything works and this game really doesn't need more. It is very nice to see this kind of simple games also in Steam.Playing is easy, first levels gives the idea of the game quickly and rules stay same through the game. But some of the levels are really tricky, and this game definitely gives a lot of levels to solve. Apparently daily levels are randomly generated so playing never ends.Like in any good puzzle game, sometimes you solve levels easily, sometimes you get stuck for a good while and level seems even impossible. Until next day you solve that level without problems. But usually it is quite easy to get forward in good pace and you do not need to play all levels in order.I really like this game, it is easy to play just few levels or sometimes an hour passes easily.

Indeed, the style of game is incredibly simple and doesn't innovate too much (you draw lines between nodes, activating all of them the necessary number of times with a specific or non-specific colour), but it stretches the use of this mechanic to its full extent and doesn't leave you feeling like there's untapped potential. The style is charming and minimalist, and as you progress, you can change the colour palette to always keep the style familiar, but slightly more exciting - and changing the colour palette whenever a new one unlocks DOES make the game feel fresh.A unique part of this game is the addition of Daily puzzles, and while I first approached it with some skepticism, thinking it would simply repeat puzzles from the main sets, it truly does bring in new challenges each day that keeps the mind active and sharp.Overall, It's great for people interested in working their brains without taking them out onto the verandah and beating them with a cricket bat."

This isn't Rubik's Cube, but some of the levels can be downright diabolically devious to overcome. There's never a time limit, you can work on each level as long as you'd like. It's also one of those games that you can pick up, play five minutes, and put away. Unfortunately, it has a very strong ""Just one more level"" factor to counterbalance. The graphics are simple and elegant, very smooth, and very very effective at teaching the game to players without resorting to any language. Seriously, this game's look and feel teaches players how to play so effeciently that you find yourself automatically doing what it's asking without thinking about it. The learning curve isn't very steep, but the complexity mounts tremendously, moving from easy trial and error solutions to thought requirements then some trial and error. There's no scoring, just how many levels you've beaten. It's simple, beautiful, and a joy to work with. It's also available for Android, and I've already snapped it up for my phone and tablet.

The nature of this puzzle game means you cannot make partial progress in levels: you have to solve the whole thing at once. Solving levels is a process of trying a layout, finding the spot it doesn't work, and redoing everything with that problem in mind. This makes the more challenging levels surprisingly taxing as you have to keep a mental grasp on the entire puzzle throughout.Note: The smaller levels end up feeling samey and repetitive over time, especially the daily challenges, but the larger levels make up for this."

It's a nice little bit of brain training with both fixed levels to work through and daily levels.   The base levels unlock in sets as you complete them as well as do the first two days of daily puzzles.  There are 25 puzzles per set, with 650 puzzles total in the fixed puzzles.   That may sound like a lot, but some puzzles will take seconds to complete while others could take a minute or more so it won't take more than a couple days of regular play to get through them all.  But the daily puzzles tend to add up to another 350 puzzles per week if you play them all.   So even if you blow through the main puzzles in a couple days, there's plenty to come back to.  In addition to all of this there's a sort of meta game of collecting triangles as you play.  Each set is ranked by difficulty with 1 to 5 triangles and if you complete all the puzzles in the set you get those number of triangles added to a master score.   It's not a big thing, but I'm curious to find out what happens at 999 triangles earned out of 999.  I'm about a 120 away from there on the iOS version (so maybe a week and a half more worth of daily puzzles).  It'll take a lot longer on this version since I started it only recently.In any event this game is excellent.  Not many puzzle games get me coming back to them... which makes this a pretty special game.  Plus I don't review games if I don't feel they are worth my time.

As the puzzles progress, different variations in the puzzles create new scenarios, and thus increase the complexity of each puzzle. By completing the puzzle, you progress onward to the next, and so on and so forth. There is no losing in LYNE. There is no time limit, either. You can take as long as you would like to solve each puzzle, and there is no penalty for simply coming back to that puzzle later.In the game, there are 26 levels, ranging from letters A to Z. Each level has sub-levels of 25. This equivalates to 650 puzzles just in the regular game mode alone. However! After completing set A and B (I believe), the player is then allowed access to daily sets. These daily puzzles consist of a version A and B, both having 25 sublevels in them. That's another 50 new puzzles per day. These puzzles range in difficulty and are completely random. With a staggering number of 700+ puzzles in just a week, there is plenty to do on LYNE.Not only is there no pressure for you to whiz by the game, but there is also a very calming and entracing soundtrack that accompanies you as you play. With each movement of the puzzle pieces, there are tones that mix together and with the soundtrack to create some really beautiful, relaxing music. Not only is this music a nice stress-reliever, but there is an actual science behind it. The ambient noises actually promote brainwave activity, thus amplifying a better mood, problem-solving, cognition, and much more. But, hey, who doesn't like to just hear something nice playing in the background?All in all, LYNE is a fantastic game that can be played by any one of any age. Not too mention it is affordable at only $2.99 (about $0.75 with a coupon). It's a great way to relax after a long day at work, decompress after some stressful online match, or just to simply pass the time. If you haven't played it already, I strongly recommend that you do. It is really a gem that will have you hooked!10/10"

On the surface LYNE is simple, and straight forward. But as you progress it becomes incresingly more dificult, but not to the point of contemplating whether or not chucking your mouse across the room is worth it. Each puzzle is easily beatable if you just think for a sec, and not once have I felt as if I was never meant to solve it at all.

These were questions that kept popping into my head, and in the end, I always found the answer.Some puzzles you'll have one attempt and get it right, while others you'll have 30 attempts and say ""this level has no answer, it's broken"", but then you realize ""nah, I'm dumb"" when you figure it out. And then you'll play the next level and repeat this cycle.Overall, like the description of the game says, it is ""deceptively simple"" and ""infinitely complex"", but don't let that detour you, it is a challenging and quite fun game if you're into puzzle games.

The game, effectively, is to find a route through all the nodes on a grid, such that ""router"" nodes are used the stipulated number of times.   Colourful, relaxing, and very very satisfying.Most levels have multiple solutions, which grants a very rewarding gameplay.  Most of the levels can be solved with about 10 seconds of observation, and about 5 seconds of swiping.  There are some, however, which require far more consideration.  The longest I spent was about half an hour trying and re-trying paths through the level, until I ended up giving up and cheating, using a hint online.    Other than that one slip, the rest of the game was quite solvable with patience.Perfectly suited to casual gaming, I left the game minimized, until my tea breaks, when I'd do a level or two.

The fact that the mechanics are very self-explanatory and easy to expand on make for great gameplay as you are constantly facing surprisingly difficult challeneges. For example, I was playing one of the daily challenges, which features 25 generated puzzles that are completely new, and for the first half, I thought ""This is really easy"". After that though, I was spending a good 15 - 20 minutes on each level. This game goes from real easy to really challenging very quickly, but for whatever reason, the way it is done doesn't make you feel stupid. You still feel like you are progressing.Basically, this game is worth the purchase. It has nice sounds and the game is easy to get into. I certainly recommend this game as a very good, if not fantastic puzzle game.(Plus, there's at least 650 puzzles, plus all the daily puzzles, so you will have more than enough gameplay)"

To begin you're giving one different colour and you're tasked to get it to connect to the other end piece while lighting up all of the same colours similtainiously, sounds easy right? Well it gets far more complicated, they begin to introduce blocks which need to be activated a certain amount of times and different colours which can't be crossed over, the puzzels get quite challenging later on.  It's somewhat addictive, I personally either found myself breezing through some levels or getting suck figuring out how to get that damn fith diamond lit up.  Either way, if you're plowing through levels like a bat out of hell or stuck figuring out how to finish a puzzel correctly the sense of satifaction you get from completeing a level, is quite thrilling.  The implimentation of daily levels for people who just can't get their fill of making lines is quite cute.  Not to mention the ambient music makes it all the more calming an experience. And the graphical makes it much easier to recognize what it is you should be focusing on. Reccomened for anyone who needs a few hours to just chill out, it's relatively inexpensive and it'll get the job done and then some, although it may not be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're some sort of action junkie I can't see you getting much of a thrill out of connecting lines."

Cool mechanic, interesting puzzles, lots of little twists on it, an enormous amount of content (though a good deal of that content is repetitions of simple concepts to make sure you understand a new twist).

It doesn't try and dress itself up in a story, like some other puzzle games i've seen, which is definitely a plus. You just start it up and play.The basic premise is to fill the ""board"", drawing lines between nodes and switches, except you can't cross the lines. It's kind of like sewing buttons, but on a digital canvas. Complete a set of 25 to earn points. It is fairly simple to play, but as levels increase the solutions become much more complex, and like most puzzles, take breaks. Otherwise things can get very frustrating.This game is mouse controlled, but I've found streaming it to a mobile device to be quite a fun experience as well.The graphics in this game are very minimal and simplistic, and you can unlock new backgrounds as you earn points. This is good, as it helps set the focus on the puzzle. Similarly, the sound design in this game is very simplistic, but well done.There is pretty much no limit to this game (at least none that I have found). There are new ""daily puzzles"" that are generated, well, daily to keep you playing as well as a mysterious ""???"" puzzle that you can start to decode after you earn enough points.This is a very good game if you like puzzles, just be sure to pace yourself."

There are hundreds of levels, with daily generated levels to continue indefinitely. Levels can become repetitive and mechanical after some time, so it gets tiresome at times. The difficulty curve is fair, slowly introducing new elements. The price is very fair, so if you get tired of waiting for people to make moves in Hearthstone, here's a cheap option to keep your brain active while waiting on other games."

Evidently he was a chieftain, for in certain marching formations among the green men a chieftain brings up the extreme rear of the column.

,Recommended,266010,10732484,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,Gett Numbers,"LYNE is something I haven't found in a while; a simple puzzle game with a casual element to it. I've always loved casual puzzle games but I've never been able to find many, especially in recent times. I love the concept for being such a simple yet malleable one. All you do is connect lines. That's it, but, adding more simple ideas, such as different colors and looping lines through themselves, gives this game a great variety and suprising difficulty.And it's not short either. There's 26 sets with 25 puzzles for each one and a steady increase in difficulty, introducing harder mechanics throughout every 1 or 2 sets. But what happens when you get through all of those? Where do I go now? Well, there's a wonderful daily system in place that randomly generates 1-3 sets, each with a varying degree of difficulty. Each day, you can come back and play a new daily set of sets, giving this simple game a huge replayability.However, there are some minor, minor problems. One of which is the difficulty spikes. One puzzle in a set usually has me there for at least 5 minutes whereas the rest of them are around a minute or less. Now that's too bad, as getting stuck helps me get better at thinking in different ways; looking at things in a different perspective. Although, it is slightly annoying to be stuck on a puzzle for so long. Also, some people may complain about the ""lack of tutorial"" when introducing new things, but that's what makes this game unique and stylized. That's what makes it so rewarding to solve a puzzle that you've been on for 5 minutes or longer.But the best thing by far in the game is the atmosphere. The sounds and the ability to change palette really sold me on this game. I thoroughly enjoy just clicking on the shapes and listening to the sounds ping off, and then connecting makes shapes gives me a little reward. When you complete a puzzle, a simple ambient sound resonates through into the next level and the screen goes white, knowing that I solved the puzzle and that this is my reward. When I don't complete a puzzle, it tells me what things I need to connect and flashes at me in red to help me guide my way into solving the puzzle.All in all, this game is great at what it does and took a very simple concept and expanded it greatly. With it's wonderful sound and level design, it did great to suck me and it seems like a game I would play for years. Basically, purchase it now. It's cheap enough to not pick up. Buy it now!"

,Recommended,266010,22473365,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,TheWorstAmy,"This game is everything written on the box.  It's a puzzler with a concept that sounds relatively simple at first - just connect a line of shapes from beginning to end - but the more you play, the more the game throws at you, the more shapes you have to connect, and the more crossroads you're given, until this once simple game curiously grows difficult enough for you to have to wrack your brain around everything you know just to solve a single puzzle.  It's an eventually infuriating but ultimately satisfying experience to be able to complete.The music, as stated, is also intentionally calming.  The background pads drone as each connection is audibly accentuated with a soft syntheized pop.  It's minimal, but that's the point, and it's destressing enough to make up for those moments where you can't seem to make the right connection.  Think of the game Flow Free turned up to eleven and a soundtrack turned down to ""chill out"" and you have a game I would recommend to any fan of puzzle games."

,Recommended,266010,13662118,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,interFaZer,"SCOREGameplay ★★★☆☆Graphics ★★★☆☆Soundtrack ★★★☆☆PROSChallenging, but not frustratingThis game is all about solving puzzles that go from *this is so easy it solves itself* to *is this even possible to solve?*. You can be a man and squeeze your brain to solve the puzzles or be a pansy and find the solutions on YouTube. It’s not like I did that or anything... a friend told me.Relaxing casual funAnd I don’t say it sarcastically. Lyne is perfect for those who are looking for a quick challenge without too much commitment. The sounds and different color palettes make the game a constantly-fresh experience."
,Recommended,266010,18345827,"Posted: 5 October, 2015",all,ErickaUnlimited,"OverviewLyne is a simple, yet intuitive indie puzzle game that revolves around creating ""pathways"" that link matching shapes together without crossing paths of other color variants. Honestly, that is the goal of every puzzle in the game, but what I enjoyed about Lyne was the variety in which you could complete such a simple task. The game takes you through the letters of the alphabet and, as you'd probably guess, the further along you go, the harder and more complex the puzzles become. You start out with two colors and a simple solution is often identified quickly, allowing you to seamlessly glide through the first set of puzzles. As you progress, the game adds sort of ""gateways"" in which a set number of lines, or lynes if you will, can pass through without conflicting with one another; think of it as a sort of intersection.As time progresses , the game adds more shapes to match and gateways to fill and it can become quite complicated, but never frustratingly so, in my opinion. What I enjoyed about the difficulty is it never really spiked; the game gradually increased the challenge as you progressed. I never felt annoyed or frustrated at puzzles I could not figure out and that is what I loved about Lyne.The game's simple, yet soothing atmosphere makes it a pleasure, even when you can't, for the life of it all, figure out the solution. Aside from all that, what I enjoy most about Lyne are the daily puzzles. These are randomly generated each day and vary in difficulty - from easy to extreme. This added feature gives the game replay-ability when you feel like sitting down and cracking out a few puzzles to unwind, or for a mental challenge. If you like puzzle games, I'd suggest Lyne.ProsChallenge - Lyne can be tough, but gentle. It never seems unfair just for the sake of challenging you.Replay-ability - With daily puzzles to try, even after you beat the game there is still always something to try.Visuals - Lyne is simple, yet nice to look at and to listen to. You may also unlock new color modes to select what works best for your eyesight and ascetic tastes.ConsCons - It is hard to say. I like to think every game can improve itself, but it's hard to find something in Lyne I didn't enjoy. I suppose it would be nice to have more puzzles each day if you complete the daily ones; perhaps an option to randomly generate some based on your desired difficulty setting.Overall, I enjoyed Lyne. I originally bought it for the achievements to use in my profile, but found I got a lot more for my money than just virtual achievements and I was very pleased. If you enjoy puzzle games and are looking for something new, I suggest checking Lyne out."

,Recommended,266010,12215309,"Posted: 24 September, 2014",all,regi.,"LYNE is a simple, yet challenging puzzle game, made by Aussie developer Thomas Bowker, this game very easily shows off the creativity of today.LYNE has you staring at your computer for hours on end, trying to figure out how to connect those final lines. The game starts off easy, only having one colour and an easy path to go over, but quickly develops in difficulty. By about set 'F', the game has multiple colours, all needing to go somewhere. The simplicity of the graphics and music is done excellently. The whole game is about connecting and drawing lines, but at the same time, covering the entire board and not hitting any other colour. When you finally see the answer, you will realise that it's been staring you in the face the entire time. On some levels, there are these overlapping type squares that allow you to put multiple colours through it at once, although, this is not always useful, seeing as you need to fill that completely as well before the level is finished.This game is PERFECT for casual gamers and people who like to spend time on things. LYNE has no time limit so you can spend all day trying to figure out how to bring that red line to the other red area... By the time you finish one set, there's another one. Each set has 25 levels. There are 26 level sets, all have their own names. If you could call a single letter a name. So, 25 times (*) 26 = a whopping 650 words, all for a small price of $3 (to be more precise, $2.99) and during the sales, you can get this game for an even smaller price of $0.49, which is a massive bargain. I mean, 49 cents for a game that will leave you addicted for hours on end, and that's what LYNE is all about, a simple, yet almost perfect puzzle game.If all of that hasn't persuaded you to buy this game yet, there's trading cards and steam achievements as well.PROS:- Addictive- Fun- Annoying- Cheap- Has trading cards- Over 649 levels- Made by an Australian- Has achievementsCONS:- Annoying- Addictive- Not very many people know about it and they may ask questions about what you're playing"

I've noticed for a few months that a few users spell out a word or phrase on their Steam profile using the images of the achievements unlockable in the game. I decided to humor the idea of seeing what kind of game this would be, and I've been left nothing short of amazed.The concept is rather simple: Create lines between like shapes, and don't intersect others. It's a bit more complicated than that later on, but that's the jist of it. The lack of a soundtrack, only accompanied by chimes and soft sounds, is beautiful. The basic color scheme, and calm graphical design, create an immediately calming presense. The level design is something else. While some are incredibly easy, others will almost certainly impede your progress, but without leaving the bitter taste of a poor puzzle. I found that each harder puzzle was only one or two mouse clicks away from being correct, and completing such a puzzle leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Not to mention the seductive chime that plays after every completed level.I haven't played terribly far into the game, but I've realized just how clever, how beautiful it really is. I tend to find solace in video games after a long day, and lately, my only interest has been to complete more puzzles here! This is a fantastic game, a great stress reliever, and for whatever reason is incredibly useful in spelling words on your Steam wall!"

,Recommended,266010,20194768,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,Sellyme,"A surprisingly intuitive and easy to pick up puzzle game that introduces devilish complexity and a frankly staggeringly large number of levels (I'm an hour and a half in and I've only completed 75 out of 650 puzzles), coupled with the fact that at the time of review LYNE is on sale for just $0.89 means that it's an unbeatable buy. I have purchased several hundred games and LYNE is hands down bar none the best value for money.With a pleasant simplistic design that lets you get straight into the puzzle solving (which can take anywhere between half a second and half an hour per puzzle, depending on the difficulty), it's something that I wish we saw more of in modern video games. One of my largest gripes with puzzle games is when you're forced to sit through a several minute tutorial with mandatory wait times or - even worse! - having to watch the game do it for you at an antagonisingly slow pace. LYNE has no such tutorial. Instead, you learn the mechanics of the game through a series of a slowly ramping difficulty curve, and if the puzzles are too easy at the start (which they probably will be for anyone who's played similar games before), they take less than a second to complete and the next one loads rapidly, with no gimmicky ""congratulations!' screen or long celebration animations. You complete it, it slides off screen, and the next one slides in.All in all, LYNE is a solid 9.5/10 puzzle game. It's good for someone who just wants to fiddle around with a game for 10 minutes on a lunch break, or for someone who wants to spend hours if not days meticulously completing every single one of the 650 levels. I would highly recommend it, and at the current price, you'd be stupid not to buy it."

I only bought this game to get the achievements for my profile so I didn't try to have fun, I just tried to do it as fast as possible. I can see why it may be enjoyable because it is a unique and well put together puzzle game. Although it can get repetitive and boring after the first ten sets or so.

You'll get stuck on a puzzle and have to restart but solving a hard puzzle is very gratifying.Such a great game if you love solving puzzles or just want to pass the time. It's such a relaxing game. This is the type of game that you'll play with music or play while listening to a podcast or watch a video.There are just so many thoughts I have about this game that I can't even write them all down.

At least, not in the sense of making logical deductions. Intuition and trial & error is generally much more effective in solving the levels. After the main gimmicks are introduced in the first few levels, there isn't much more to it than simply bigger levels with a few more colours. The whole thing feels computer generated, in a bad way. Worse still is the number of puzzles with multiple solutions, which combined with the trial and error makes me feel more like guessing the puzzle instead of solving the puzzle."
,Recommended,266010,25931786,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,PF-67,"With the achievements being what they are, this game was somewhat an ingenious money grab. All the steam profile enthusiasts (myself included) rushed to buy this game as a result of them.The game presents itself as a game that focuses on the puzzle genre – a goal which it accomplishes as intended. If one were to use guides, the game would still take upwards of several hours and on a normal play-through this game can offer tens of hours of pushing your mind to the limits, just so that you can get that sweet sense of satisfaction of getting the word ‘DAB’ to show on your profile. (Dab is dead now anyway)Steam achievements aside, as one would somewhat expect, the music and sound effects are fitting for the puzzle genre. The game's aesthetic side is flawless with the art being very abstract and the animation being smooth, especially when a puzzle is completed. Seeing the tiles rotate, fade white and slowly move away gives one a sense of satisfaction. The colours sometimes compliment and sometimes contradict each other, but, in turn, they are effective in focusing your attention on some things and not on others – something that can be useful in a puzzle game.With such a game, the requirements to play it are obviously low and the game runs smoothly, and there are no apparent bugs that appear unless you have an issue such as broken drivers. As an abstract artistic expression, the game exceeds many other puzzle games that attempt to accomplish the same thing, and along with the amount of popularity gained from other factors, allowed this game to rise to some small form of prominence.Overall, to me at least, one of the biggest selling points of this game is the small price. Compared to games that may give you a few hours for $60/£40, the genre of puzzle games in general far supersedes this. For less than $5/£3 the game successfully manages to deliver several hours of enjoyment to the player, and is excellent as a sort of brain-teaser.The only things I would say this game fails in are: the lack of variety - you might expect some more puzzling elements to be introduced later on, but in general, it keeps getting harder. Additionally, there is little to no replay value, which can be a big factor to some people.Overall, I would give this game an 8/10."

I guess you could use them to spell out words like one of the people in the featured reviews said. There's also a daily level set unlocked once you beat the two first level sets, so even if you finish the game, you have more to do if you're bored.For the cheap price it's at, I guess it's worth it. The first levels are pretty easy, but on Level Set C it starts going up way higher.If you like having that ""Ahaaaa...!"" moment when you finally realize what you did wrong, get the game.If you hate effort, and love hacking in FPS games to feel like you're the best, ♥♥♥♥ off and go back to your Call of Duty."

WAY too long. ""You unlocked a skin."" ...Wow thanks... just... something for me to do to not get so bored with the same stuff I've been doing for the past several levels... The main reason I rate this down is because there's 26 levels or ""areas"" (one for each letter of the alphabet) and in each of those, there's about 30--THIRTY--sublevels. After level ""C"" you already are introduced to all the game's mechanics and all the new challenging obstacles. After that it's over 350 levels of just the same stuff. I remember sitting here for nearly 8 hours playing just to get to ""S"". It's so monotonous and boring you'll want to kill yourself like me. I understand it's supposed to be ""peaceful"" or ""serene"" but after the first 5 letters, I just got bored and looked up a walkthrough to speedrun the game. It almost got even more annoying at that point just because you had to wait for the end of the letter level and just... ugh.RATING REASON:Come on, thirty levels in each letter? I mean, that's perfectly fine. Nice amount of content, I suppose. But you HAVE to introduce new mechanics. You just HAVE to. You are introduced to the last game mechanic in the third letter level. You just can't repeat the same mechanics for 690 levels. (Yes I did the math. 30 x 23). Don't waste your time unless you honestly have the patience.Seven hundred and eighty levels of the same damn thing... Good god..."

Later levels have intersections thatmustbe used a specific number of times for a successful completion.LYNE quickly gets pretty fiendish & you'll be back-tracking as you try to (ornotto) cross lines in the right/wrong places. It's a fairly simple task to reset your line though - or even to just remove a 'bad link'.Accompanied by a chilled-out soundtrack, the in-game bleeps & bloops merge with the music to form a soothing audio experience.At a wallet-friendly £1.99 (& currently £1.33 on promotion), LYNE is an absolutemust-havefor any fan of the genre!10/10"

I wanted to write things out in my achievement showcase though, and I didn't want to just use Steam Achievement Manager or look up a guide.  That would more or less make the game a waste of money.After around six hours of this game over the course of two sessions, I started to get a severe case of the Tetris Effect.  Every time I closed my eyes, I would start connecting shapes together.  In the days that followed, my dreams consisted entirely of connecting shapes together and solving puzzles.I started to become frustrated with everyday life.  Why couldn't I connect shapes together in real life?  Why didn't connecting shapes together in my head solve my real world problems?That was a month and a half ago.  I have since picked the game up again, but I'm using a guide this time.  It's a compromise between having no fun and the shape-infested hell I was living in when I first started playing.  There are also randomly generated puzzles that are just as good as the normal ones, so if I start seeing shapes again, I can always just cheat all of the achievements and play the random levels afterward.Let it be known that I beat sets A-F and got partway through G before losing my mind.  I urge that if you want to play this game legitimately...at least pace yourself.  Otherwise, you could end up like me.Edit:  Today, scared of returning to shape-infested hell, I cheated the achievements."

I've not invested the time that other reviewers have, but I can imagine from what I've seen that the mechanics of this game don't get any more complex as you progress. Each level set does become more difficult between its beginning and its end, but because there are so many level sets, it feels like playing the same game over and over again.There is no ambient soundtrack, which is for me an essential part of a minimalist puzzle game (although on the flip side, you can listen to your own music over it instead).There is no real logic to be applied to the solution process -- yes, there is a little bit of reasoning involved (this node has this number of empty slots, so this many paths will go through it; that color tile can only be accessed that way), but nothing engaging or stimulating. Any given puzzle often has multiple solutions, which is . . . nice, I guess, and uninteresting.There is, basically, nothing to DO. And with 26 sets of 25 levels each, plus new daily sets, there's a whole lot of nothing to do. I take another crack at this game every other evening to see if I just wasn't in the right frame of mind last time I played it, and every time I close it after a level or two, more bored than when I started. If it's on sale for less than $1, sure, buy it, get some achievements to make a funny message in your showcase. But if you're looking for a puzzle game that makes you really feel the blood flowing in your brain, play Hexcells.Really, play Hexcells anyway. It's a fantastic game."

Free daily challenge levels are available to play so you'll never run out of levels, even if you manage to complete the built-in level set!Admittedly, however, since I obtained a mobile version of LYNE I have been playing that a lot more. I think I may have gotten farther in the Steam/PC version than I ddi in the mobile version, but it's great on mobile and good on a PC with Steam, and the background sound/tones/rumble/etc. is really great with PC speakers and a subwoofer.Quality headphones probably help on mobile, but they give me a rather large side-to-side dent in my thick hair which provokes uncontrollable laughter from others even when they have been warned. That's not the end of the world, because I enjoy making others laugh and enjoy laughing with them.Half the time my hair is shaped like a bike helmet anyway—much less often than 50% of the time during the season known as Winter—but that's easier to remedy than the horizontal headphone hair... woe is me? No, woe is not me. Laughter is the best medicine ;-)AND....LYNE is a good game if you enjoy puzzlers."

Yes, it's a game where you connect shapes with single lines, but it goes so astronomically far beyond that. I can't even properly explain how the problem solving ends up working on each level; it's that fluid and intuitive. You just... start with one color and then try other colors until it works, and there's process of elimination and trial and error and each level completed is a soothing, peaceful little tidbit of satisfaction. The very early levels provide a good example of this game's whole vibe, with gameplay hints disguised in three or four words that you have to look at in relation to the current level and what you need to do. That's hard to explain too, I'm not doing it well. Lyne is calming and focusing at the same time, and I would have gladly paid full price for it. Heck, I would've happily paid like ten bucks for it if it was that price and I had a chance to try it out first. Do yourself a favor, even if you're not a huge fan of puzzle games, and buy this game.

The puzzle mechanic in itself is interesting and carries the game, which is a balanced combination out of trail & error and arranging the lines. But that's kinda all there is. The learning curve is what was bothering me towards the end, it went up and down and up and down. It's as if they threw just a bunch of levels into the game and went out for a coffee after that. But maybe that's just how modern puzzle games work. It lacks depth, not in the puzzle, but everything else. Would still recommend."

76561198081554978,Recommended,266010,13338237,"Posted: 12 December, 2014",all,The Government,"★★★⋆☆ (3.5/5 - Decent)(WARNING: This review contains mild spoilers)LYNE is one of those clever minimalistic games that focuses on providing simple but entertaining casual gameplay. Your aim in LYNE is to connect nodes of the same shape and colour in order to create one single line between them. Lines can travel between nodes and shapes in eight possible directions. Although this may seem like a simple procedure, there are certain elements in the game that can provide challenging and thought-provoking problems for the player.LYNE only requires the mouse to fully utilise the game, this along with simple gameplay makes LYNE very easy to pick up and play. You create lines by dragging between two nodes, to delete a node you simply reverse the process and drag back to the previous node. Occasionally clicking in the wrong location can also remove linked lines but this is rarely a problem and most players will only have this happen to them a couple of times so long as they're careful. The gameplay is smooth and menu and level transitions are practically flawless.When you begin the game you have access to a simple yet informative tutorial and getting your bearings on the game and understanding it is painless, within minutes you'll be clearing LYNE boards like there is no tomorrow.The graphics and effects in LYNE are minimal (hence the reason the game is classified as a minimalist game) but the effects and use of colours is relaxing and a high level of detail is definitely still present. Palettes help to excel the game and provide interesting colour and pattern combinations. The graphics all appear to be vector images and this makes the game clean and enhances its sense of tranquility further.The music of LYNE is probably the most important and most effective part of the game. The game prides itself as being a  ""relaxing puzzle game"". The music and sound effects is what makes this claim so abundantly true. The music itself is a relaxing blend of trance and drone-style ambience. Every time you join a line between nodes a soft calming note plays. Although simple, the gentle qualities of the notes and sounds used within the game easily ties it together as a whole.I would consider only playing this game in short periods to recieve the full effect of the game, playing it in long sessions can destroy the game for some people who see it as repetitive and boring. The game is fairly repetitive with each level set getting gradually more and more difficult, but if you play it in short bursts you should still find it fresh and enjoyable.This brings me to my next comment - replay value. The game as many have said can get boring after a while, but daily random levels of differing difficulty can help to provide more entertainment between the regular level sets. Also, as you complete level sets, both daily sets and the regular ones, you will recieve strange codebits known as ""Cipher"" which help you to unlock new colour palettes and other interesting content.The difficulty is almost spot on and rarely will you get stumped on levels that cannot be solved with 10 - 15 minutes. The amount of Cipher you earn in any given set correlates to the difficulty of the puzzle (e.g. 1 = easy set, 5 = very challenging etc.).Overall I would highly recommend LYNE to anyone who likes puzzle games or any casual gamers that are looking for a relaxing and fun game to ease their mind after a troubling day. Basically anyone can pick this game up and I encourage those interested to do so, I almost guarantee you will not be disappointed!Rating:Story = N / AGameplay & Controls = 4/5Graphics = 3.5/5Audio = 4/5Replay Value = 3/5Difficulty = 3.5/5"

Things start out simply enough; but with each set you unlock, the puzzles slowly and steadily become more complex. The puzzles themselves aren't terribly ""big"" per se, but you do run into some head-scratchers here and there that might take you longer than some of the others in the same set to figure out. Luckily each set has plenty of puzzles, so if you get stuck on one you can just leave it be, try another and come back to it later.All I can say is, the way they've come up with so many combinations of lines connecting panels to color-coded diamonds, squares and triangles is somewhat baffling and maddening. I will recommend LYNE because I do enjoy it, but I'll also recommend you play it in small doses. I do a set or two at a time and then I need to move on to something else. Because although the puzzles are well done, after playing for so long it can start to feel quite repetitive and you may strain your patience muscle. The puzzles are very uniform but therefore also predictable and doing too many will make the game feel monotonous, which is really not fair to it, because again, it can be very enjoyable.What else to say? It's peaceful, it's relaxing, it's simple and visually-pleasing and even comes with multiple unlockable color palettes... and with over 600 individual puzzles - not including the daily puzzles - LYNE is not exactly in any rush to be finished (so don't peek at solutions!). Grabbed this on sale but I think I'd pay the full three bucks for it. I'm not sure what the replay value will be like after I've completed everything, but for now I'm having a lot of fun with it."

No in-game purchases.  Relaxing visual layout and sound effects.  It's one of the best kinds of puzzle games in which you figure out how to play in minutes (thanks to a simple tutorial set), and can find yourself playing for hours to get just one more level completed.  All you do is create lines to connect like-colored shapes together.  The challenge involves passing through various hubs and not crossing over any lines you've already drawn.  If you need to start over, you just click on any shape to erase any lines previously drawn from that point.  For those who like Steam achievements, you get one for every set of 25 puzzles you complete, plus there are random daily sets.  Lyne is a highly addictive and satisfying mental workout."

You try to connect multiple colored points together through ""connector"" points. Each connector point has a certain amount of times you can drag a line through it. You need to connect all the reds, blue, or yellow points together, while filling up the number of times you can pass through the connector points. It is not difficult and difficult at the same time. Give it a try.Also, it comes with 20 cent worth cards and each achievement looks like a letter, so you can spell something out on your achievement showcase."

It seems simple, but like most puzzle games, the more you advance, the harder it gets. I love LYNE. Why is that? Well, I like the way it's simple, but at the same time intelligent. The game is addictive and you will find yourself coming back to challenge your brain. The art is simplistic, but it fits the game just right. You can change it as you advance with smooth combinations of colors. It's simple and intelligent just like the game. There is not much music, when you interact with the levels, sound comes out of your interactions. Sometimes it can create an appeasing melody. The goal is just to relax your mind, while at the same time working it.In LYNE, you have two options, to play the pre-built levels which go from A to Z with 25 levels in each (650 levels, if you feel lazy) or do the dailies which are levels generated everyday for you to play. You guessed right, the longevity of the game isn't bad. While LYNE is a mobile port, it is a good one. Both are the same things, except for the Steam features (achievements and cards).I highly recommend LYNE for everyone who would like a game that chills your mind, but exercises it at the same time."

A video or even image will make much clearer sense than a text descrpiton will but basically there is at least 1 shape on each level. There is a start point, and an end point, and you have to draw lines from one to the other and make sure to connect every corresponding shape along the way. At the same time you can't overlap any lines, there's normally more than one shape, and each non shape on the board (junctions basically) have to have the correct number of lines travelling through them.There's good levels of difficulty, very easy to very hard, and a good number of puzzles. There's also at least 1 daily puzzle for you to complete, so you can invest plenty of time into it, as my hours on record suggest. Easily worth the money on sale or at full price."

You'll encounter puzzles that are morecomplex than the other and may require you some time to figure out how to solve it.Another reason why it's outstanding is the challenge is very rewarding. There are times when you might find surprising yourself. (Those are the moments when it seems like your eyes and hands coordinate without you knowing and the puzzle gets solved instantly. I don't know why or how, but it usually happens when my thoughts are lost on other things. LOL.)I, generally, recommend this game to those who love and are into puzzle games.

Sure, it gives you achievements that are letters so you can write your name on your profile.

It's fun, it's simple, it's addicting, and it genuinely challenges your brain regardless of how simple it seems. At the beginning of the game, it's very simple. It just gets harder and harder from there.Pros- Simple gameplay- Tough puzzles- Very casual, easy to kick back and play- Challeges your brain real good- Infinite puzzles, since there are new level packs literally every day, not to mention the 650 built in levels (26 packs, 25 levels each). At $2.99, that's 217 levels per dollar, which is irrelevant if you do the daily puzzle packs which just keep coming.- Even for full price, it's a really good deal for any puzzle fan- Beautiful art styleCons- If you don't like puzzles it will be painful for you- Boolean volume control. If you want to turn the game volume down, either turn it off or go to the volume mixer.I would definitely recommend it if you have a bit of extra cash.

If you are a fan of logic/puzzle games, I’d recommend not missing this gem.1) Minutes to learn, long time to master: LYNE’s gameplay is incredibly simple. You connect a beginning shape to an ending shape by drawing a line through similar shapes. That’s it—that’s the entire game. And yet, once puzzles start increasing in size and complexity, there’s a lot of challenge and a lot of satisfaction to be had from meeting the challenge.2) Colour and atmosphere: Progressing through level sets allows you to unlock different colour schemes, giving you 12 different palettes to chose from. The soundtrack is player generated: each move made in the puzzle sounds a harmonic chime, while finishing a puzzle rewards you with a sustained note that blends beautifully with the sounds of the next puzzle.3) It never ends: With 26 level sets containing 25 puzzles each, there are 650 levels for your enjoyment/frustration. Plus there’s an infinite set of random puzzles generated daily, moving up in complexity as the week progresses, to let you get a daily fix of twisted brain (if you’re into that sort of thing).4) Bletchley Park 2: Buried in the game is a hidden cipher (for the not-so-amateur codebreaker) which reveals parts of itself as you play, and spells out a personal message from the developer. Whether you want to try to crack it yourself, or just read through the Steam discussion thread and marvel at the dedication and cleverness of the community that solved it, it’s a neat touch that makes a great game just a little bit more personal."

The puzzles are simple and can be completed very quickly if you can see the solution, but as you press on, some of them turn into real stumpers. It's probably best that I don't try to explain how the puzzles work here, so check out the video on the store page.There is plenty of content here. There are 26 sets of 25 puzzles each, (as far as I know - I'm still only about halfway through the alphabet!) that makes 650 puzzles in the core game. On top of that, there are new randomly generated sets avaliable every day, so even when you've completed the core sets you can continue playing new puzzles at various difficulties. New color schemes gradually unlock as you complete sets. Given the game's price, it's a worthwhile game even if you don't have the dedication to plow through the entire thing. There's also some sort of ARG going on, which isn't really my thing, but seems cool enough.Definitely recommended if you enjoy puzzle/logic games or spelling out profanity on your profile with the achievement showcase."

If you consider bang for your buck I would say that this game has a great mechanic that is seemingly easy, but can still stump you!"

Even not on sale, I would say $3 is well worth it.  There's no interface, no timers, no score...just the satisfaction of bending your brain to look at things with a different perspective.  It's easy to pick up, solve a few and go do something else....or spend a few hours working your way through the 500+ levels to unlock.  It does pick up difficulty as you go on, and while I've only made it into the first few groups of puzzles and things still seem somewhat basic, I have not gotten so frustrated as I don't want to go back to it.  The reward is completing each one.  Try it out, if it's on sale, you -can't- go wrong for less than a buck.8/10"

,Recommended,266010,21721821,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Redbeard,"I wasn't expecting much from LYNE, as it is a simple-looking affair.However, it turns out that it is quite a good puzzle game, with various brain teasers.I sailed through a lot of them in the A and B sets, and was thinking ""This is too easy"", but then there were two in the B set that I had to puzzle over for a while.When you finish the A and B sets, you unlock the daily challenges - and some of those can be complex to figure out.Am yet to start the C-Z sets.If they get progressively harder, then I might be in trouble.Good exercise for the brain.Update:Have now completed the G series. It does get a bit harder, but I have found that if I get stuck on one, if I come back to it later I can often finish it within a minute (which goes to show what a fresh look at a problem will do).However, after solving the first few hundred puzzles, it does get a bit boring.Therefore, it is probably best to play the game every few days or so, rather than try to do it all in sequential days."
