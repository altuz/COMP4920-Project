Crap like Blood on the Sand, Deadly Premonition or that one where the President of the USA pilots a mech? Yeah, this is nothing like it.It's complete garbage. It's Cry of Fear with a vaguely racist Eastern European sense of humour. If you're as dumb as me to drop ten bucks on this then you want your head looking at. Are you thinking of buying it and making funny videos laughing over it? Don't bother, pick a game that isn't painful to play. If you want to experience it just wait until Lowtax or slowbeef put it on YouTube.I wouldn't even recommend this try-hard crap to someone I hated."

It's not. Let's start with the voice actiing... Oh god, the voice acting. Not only is it obvious the actors recorded their lines over a cheap microphone setup, but you also don't understand what they're saying half the time. Sometimes their accents become too thick to decypher (the main character's especially) or for some baffling reason the volume drops to a whisper. And why must my character freeze in place every time he starts talking with a person? Must he devote all his intellectual and physical prowess just to hold a simple conversation?The AI isn't bad so much as very simple. Enemies just come running at you, spawning in from out of nowhere. (Think Aliens: Colonial Marines... better yet, don't) A few bright spots is that the gun play is all right, if nothing new, and the price isn't outrageous, although I'm probably not going to finish this game.Buyer beware. The makers of this game try to hide the flaws in their work under a paper-thin veneer of poor humor and an 'Oh, you're not meant to take it so seriously' frontage. Do not expect much from this product. Don't even expect an options menu (cause there is none, seriously)."

I was super excited about this game because it sounded like it was tailor-made for someone like me. That much is true for the content of the game (at least the half hour or so that I saw of it). The problem is that the game is almost unplayable. The sound quality is ridiculous; it sounds like the voices were recorded in one day over Skype. The soundtrack consists of one Midnight Syndicate track on a loop and a never-ending shuffle of footsteps, regardless of whether or not you're moving. There is no way to adjust settings in-game; you have to edit a file in order to re-map controls and the like. Most of the puzzles are solved by pressing up against random objects in the room until you pick up the one you're looking for. Overall, the mechanics foiled what was probably otherwise a funny, kitschy game."

Like B-Movies, some B-Tier games come in a couple of flavours - The first is a product made with heart. It's flawed, but you have fun because it's a pleasure to watch. The second is a cash in piece of nonsense, made by people who take one look at a genre of horror and want a piece of that pie.This game falls into the second catagory. Oh, how we chuckled as an image of a developer told me 'read the f***ing manual'. Oh, we giggled as I had to change any settings within the .ini file. Oh, how quickly I uninstalled the game as I tired of trying to navigate pitch black rooms with little to no sense as to where I was going.And Christ, the voice acting is so poorly recorded (Do these people not google 'Microphones' before hand), it's offensive.Avoid like the Plague."

The game, when it works, plays like a very hastily and poorly modded fps from saaaaaaaaaaaaay ten years ago? Twenty? I dunno. It's bad. But they have my money as well as the cash of all the poor peeps above and below me on the review list. So, at least someone somewhere is happy because of this game.Pros:-Short download time?-You always hear your footsteps. This may not seem like a pro, but I list it here because the game a) doesn't have many/any pros and b) because I would like to attribute the never ending clunking boot on wood floor sound to the protagonist constantly dancing in place off screen. I'm choosing to imagine that this is the case rather than that it is just another example of horrible programming. Because I'm a glass half full kinda guy. And I have a massive imagination.-Maybe the creator's finished off a house payment cause bought their game? Maybe they had a nice lunch? For two if they're supes a' dupes frugal? Maybe that cheapo twofer lunch turned in to a fruitful, marital relationship for them? Maybe you would have gotten into a car wreck or died horribly if you'd gone out and tried to do something worthwhile instead of taking the time to buy and download this game. That's right. It's a possiblity. If that was the case, this turd sandwich just saved your balogna grubbin' life. Totally plausible.  I'm going to imagine that's the case so I can sleep at night with this still residing in my Steam library, mocking me with its existence, a constant reminder that I paid for it.Cons:-After purchasing it, you have to get someone else to buy it too or you'll die in seven days. Luckily, for you at least, this game has sucked out my will to live.-Suuuuuuuupah buggy. And not in a funny or enjoyable way with craptacular renderings, objects comically going through walls due to poodoo collision, and other crazy visual effects that you can document and laugh at so much as an, ""Oh, there's my desktop and an error message. Again."" kinda way.-Some settings require adjusting an .ini and the game tells you as much. Lollios in a box of lols, true believers.-You pay for it. Like, this would be an okay game that somebody pops out for free as a means of getting their career up n' runnin' but ten daru is pricey for what plays like a buggy mod of 007: Goldeneye with improved graphics. Feel free to put quotation marks on ""improved"" if you're feelin' picky.-Think of a con. Flip a coin. If it's heads, it has it. And my money. It totes has my monies regardless of which side of the coin you see.-You feel like a failure after buying this game. A rube and a failure. With ten fewer dollars in your bank account. That you'll never have back. You coulda got a value meal at Wendy's, large and with all the fixin's, but nay. NAY! You fell for paltry advertising, you skimmed over descriptions, and totally failed to look up the background of an unknown game. You instead went all Fry meme style and said, ""Take my money!"" And they took it. Oh, they took it. And now you feel ashamed everytime you see this game listed in your library. Mocking you with it's lame achievements. You don't want your Steam friends to know you have it. Heck, you can't even complete the game just to feel like you used what you bought because it's a crashtacular crashmo with extra crash gravy on the side and crunchy crash chips on top. So, instead, you describe your failure in a review, putting your own purchasing experience in the third person so you don't have to consciously own what ya did.-You waste, like, five minutes writing the game a bad review because it totes took ten dollars from you that you'll never get back and you're all butthurt over it."

,Recommended,266050,29310607,Posted: 16 January,all,The Wrayn Man,"To be honest, I don't WANT to recommend this game, I will, mostly due to pride, but I really don't wanna. It's not worth the price tag, it's not that great. As a fellow FPSC developer, I loved the idea that a game made in my engine got some manner of ""success"" on steam. It's really funny, and really kitschy and indie, but that's about all this game has going for it. The graphics are bad in comparison to most other games (even most games in the price range), and the gameplay is nothing special besides a few semi-interesting puzzles. I recommend this only for those looking to see the technical limits of the FPSC engine in the ""graphical"" sense.@the developer: You can be proud of squeezing so much out of such an underpowered rag, and creating a believable, well thought out tale, but when it comes to the artistic side of things (aesthetics of scenery, custom non-model pack media), or the actual ""funness"" of the game (number of moments where I'm smiling, unconcerned that I am playing a video game), it's nowhere near worth the price tag. Had this game been free, it would have been compared to all the other free games i've played, and I would've loved it, but being a 7$ game, It gets compared to other AWESOME games that I've payed 7$ for like chaser or E.Y.E. or Hover: Revolt of Gamers, thus shining a bad light on this game.tl;dr: ok game, technically amazing for the game engine you used, but I would have preferred it to be free, even if it meant it was 1/4 the length. you could've definitely squeezed just as much humour and told the same story."

76561198049313249,Not Recommended,266050,15614600,"Posted: 29 April, 2015",all,nerevarine,"I can appreciate the class of games out there that are soooo bad they are good. A great example of this is Rat Hunter (FPS) or Harvester (old point and click with FMV). I heard a lot of people say Into the Dark was a buggy pile of poop but was over the top, outrageous, and entertaining. I can put up with poorly made buggy games, but this game is in the class of:So Bad, that is really is Bad.The game is terribly frustraiting, with a lot of senseless, extremely poorly executed puzzles that are game stopping.Often, you will find yourself referencing a walkthru or reloading because you die so easily in the same room for any random reason. In FPS games, IT HAPPENS, but the load times are long for an old looking game like this (looks 15 years old).Nothing is explained well, you pretty much run around a series of rooms trying to figure out how to advance to the next room/rooms. This makes progression extremely slow and cumbersome. There are a lot of other features, situations, humor, etc., but you can never appreciate or enjoy them because you are too busy trapped in some place because there is no clear way to get out. I don't expect hand holding but the game is very vague and the mechanics are so poor they do not marry to what you need to do to progress.A lot of times, any in-game speech or text alludes to what you must do, but the game level doesn't match up with what they are talking about. ""Put the bomb in the hole under the door"". There are lots of doors and none have a hole - for example. The mechanics are extremely inconsistent with the game engine so prepare to screw up a lot.In fact, the puzzles are so bad, there are pictures of the game developer in the game giving you hints.In the level I mentioned, the other problem was just learning that you have to make a bomb. In a prior level, you could shoot an explosive ""cube"" from a distance to blast through. In another level, you find a cube, but it doesn't explode if you shoot it. So the rules change for that level without the player being told. You see some explosive gas tanks but they kill you regardless of distance. Once you get the bomb making materials, you have to put in on a lab table, but you are not told that, or which one. You just have to use the walkthru.If this was some game where you are told there is a way to craft things, and these are the hotkeys, then that would make sense. But this is designed to operate as a simple FPS, so YEAH, the puzzle solutions totally do not marry well.The generic monster enemies charge you and pound you to death.There is no way to sneak around them and if you blow your ammo, you are screwed.That's fine, but sometimes, you can die in 5 hits or 1 hit. It's pretty random.Same with the enemies, one monster took 3 hits to die, another took 8.Headshots, heartshots, stuff like that don't even matter. So it's all random.This means, even if you conserve ammo, you can still use up your ammo, and still not bring the enemy down.They can also randomly spawn.If you want a very challenging PUZZLE game, give it a try, and don't use the walkthrus (even with, still challenging). If you want a run and gun FPS, pass. It's not that kind of game.It's too bad, if the game didn't have so many puzzles slowing it down, it would be much more enjoyable as a horror FPS.What's GOOD though: the dark grittiness, the cheapo-creepy atmosphere; I even enjoyed the bad voice acting.I surmise the obstacles were designed to MAKE THE GAME FEEL LONGER.After playing the ""Into the Woods"" free ""game"" that came with it,  the flaws of Into the Dark start to make sense. Into the Woods: you wake up in a forest and aren't told anything. No problem with that. You explore some ruins, find some ammo, a key, then bad guys spawn to kill you. Each small area is gated so you must find the key to get to the next one. It can be anywhere, laying in the grass, in one of many ruins, etc.When you finally get to a certain area, the game ends. EXTREMELY short.Now, imagine that indoors in cramped rooms, hallways, and puzzles mismatching with the FPS mechanics to SLOW PROGRESSION DOWN, instead of the outdoor distances you have to run to find a key laying in the grass somewhere.Add to it: they're very small glitchy levels with puzzles you often don't even know exist.Previously, this game was put out as a horror FPS. I noticed they now say it's an Adventure/FPS. LOL.Also, look at the description 11 levels but 67 puzzles.That's a lot of puzzles for such a small game with small ""levels"" (again, more like a collection of connected rooms).Thumbs down primarily due to:-Long Load Times-Puzzles that you didn't know were puzzles and that couldn't even be solved the way they need to, the way described, in a limited FPS game environment-Never got to see the much touted boobies and hookers!"

The voice acting is great to hear because of its authentic natural sound instead of something that feels too polished and scripted. Kind of like the difference between raw VHS and shiny clean BLU-RAY quality.Music grabbed me by the throat and has not let go as soon as I heard the first notes at the intro scene.The amount of interaction with the environment was a welcomed unexpected surprise. Love the amount of detail of use with the health kits :DThank you for INTO THE DARK and looking forward to your future work. Paying this little for something so great is a bit guilt inducing ha ha.

I did enjoy myself, but I don't think this game will be for everyone.

And they're justified in hating it, because it's not a product with alot of overall quality for the general consumer.It's a niche game, for niche gamers, who have niche tastes in humor and don't mind being shot through walls on occasion*, who like to just stop playing and watch an easter egg (not about to spoil it) out of the blue and can enjoy a developer who actually cares about his game, to the point where he's offered save files to people on the community who complain about bugs and other issues.*( I mean make no mistake, the game is functional and stable for the overwhleming majority.
