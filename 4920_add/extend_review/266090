It's a little-known fact that, during the development of Starlite: Astronaut Rescue, highly intelligent individuals who once helped put man on the moon were forced to simulate having no scientific education. The result is a game with physics that are all wrong and only 20 minutes of plodding, unrealistic content—all they could manage to create under these conditions before giving up. A real eye-opener, and a future none of us want to live in."

It's an interesting educational tool that should be flushed out much more fully.  The really is one task - determine the wavelength of a radio signal.  The description makes it sound like there are more of these types of puzzles, but there aren't.Even the surrounding terrain, which is supposed to be from Curiosity, is very low-res and could easily be improved upon.All told, this looks like a 3D game kit's demo rather than a true game - even educational."

When you were younger did you put on a tin foil helmet, tie a sheet around your neck, and climb piles of dirty clothes pretending you were walking on Mars...  If so you were probably super stoked for this game...   I never did these things though .....  (shifting my eyes from side to side to hide the fact I'm not being honest)...I figured for less than a dollar I'd grab this game, try it out for the 20 or so minutes that people claimed I'd get from it, pat myself on the back for taking a trip to the red planet and feel joy.Unfortunately that didn't happen, this game glitches like crazy..... the first glitch was the work bench, it wouldn't let me combine the items....  After trying about 1000 different directions I decided to check on line to see what I was doing wrong.... I did nothing wrong the game just didn't want to register that I was crafting....So I finally get past this glitch and nearly immediately afterward I'm hit with a puzzle.... awesome...  I solved the puzzle using the calculator.....  sigh... again the game glitches up.It's not the worst thing in the world, but gets kind of annoying that you need to continually restart from the beginning after every glitch..   I can't recommend this game at all, even for .89 cent.  It's far too short and bug ridden to be worth a purchase at all.Save your money for something else.  The only saving grace is the fact that buying the game will allow you to get it's 1 achievement fairly easily...  Is that enough to purchase the game.... well ask yourself if the extention of your e-peen is worth whatever price the game is selling for...  I don't personally think it is."

However, it was a long and painful 20 minutes, with graphical and interface glitches and unexplained slowdown. The graphics are horrendous and looked like something from 10 or 15 years ago. There really isn't much of a game here. You move from point A to point B several times, and have to solve a few math problems. Except with the poor calculator functionality, I opened up the Windows calculator instead. A waste of time, even if you're really into NASA and space exploration."

Thiscoughgamecoughis what you'd expect from one of those 100 Games on 1 Disc compilations for Windows 95. It's truly awful, but luckily it lasts only 15 minutes.My single positive for this title is that I encountered zero bugs/issues with my short experience. But, bugs/glitches are directly proportional to content, and so this is expected.In your short experience you'll control a rover and a human character. The looking action is awful, and movement is just as bad thanks to really terrible mouse acceleration. It feels as if the player is on ice. This problem is disguised as 'realistic physics'. It's annoying, plain and simple. Jumping and staying in the air for 2 seconds longer, and walking with longer strides is realistic physics. Not releasing the W key and waiting 2 more seconds for your character to come to a halt. Eugh.The story is a generic rescue mission, which is outlined in the title of the game. Going along as usual, someone had an accident, you have to find them by completing abstract tasks and finally you're rewarded by landing back at square one. There are a grand total ofthree6th grade maths problems that need to be solved, a 30 seconds crafting bit (with a cluttered interface) and then a short driving and positioning part with a rover.

Sometimes trying a diffrent approach to others can end up being bad in the end. You must also remember this is not NASA's first attempt at trying to create an educational game. Their first project Moonbase Alpha was a free to play game and I'm guessing it was a test to see the appeal of Space Simulation games. Due to the amount of downloads I assume their went ahead with the Starlite game. What they have to remeber is Moonbase Alpha was free, Starlight is a paid game and they should have considered that. Although Starlite does try diffrent things to moonbase. Even thought it is short every task is diffrent to the last and that's nice considering how repetetive Moonbase Alpha was, so atleast they tried to change up the gameplay this time.

There is no depth, the crafting and problem solving in the description refer to dragging a wire onto a radio twice and to dividing two numbers together using an in game calculator, and the fact that the developers chose to call this an 'RPG' or 'Simulation' is flabbergasting. The 'game' is too short and simple to be interesting, and the controls are too awkward to be fun.If this release was meant to get people excited about the eventual release of a real Starlite game, then it has failed miserably.

It's obviously geared toward younger kids, which seems typical of NASA public outreach stuff, as if adults have no interest in space exploration.   People have complained about the mushy controls, but it states that it's supposed to be a realistic Mars gravity simulation, so the awkwardness is probably just what you'd encounter with the real thing.

This is a horribly produced educational game disguised as an adventure whose sole purpose seems to be getting you to solve 3 rather simplistic division exercises. Its meant to teach the basics of triangulation as well I suppose but the interface is so horrible that getting anything to work is more luck than judgement so I would be suprised if many happy teens take that lesson home from playschool.The interface may work on a tablet or other touchscreen device I cant comment as I played the Linux version. On my version you can turn about 20 degrees left or right before your mouse pointer comes to the edge of the window and you stop turning. This leaves you walking backwards to most places as you cant turn around.In summary nice graphics shame about the game.

If you're an adult who wants to play with rovers on Mars, I'd reccomend 'Take On Mars' from the early access section.And if you're looking for more fun with text to speech?

The game is rough in a lot of ways. Graphically it's sub-par, flat textures, stiff and/or missing animations, very low-poly models; this may make the game run better on a wider variety of hardware, but it makes it look rough, even for an indie game. The controls are floaty and slow, though that may be by design given the lighter gravity of Mars. The gameplay consists mostly of ""walk here and press E/LMB"", so it's not the most intense or involved game, and although you're on a resuce mission to save a pilot running out of oxygen... there is never a real sense of urgency.Still, all that said, it's somehow charming. And it's cool to see a non-violent, science-based video game, even if it's just a rough-edged 20 minute sampler of what the developers have planned. If it were more expensive, I might judge it more harshley, but for the price, I think it's still worth it even given all the issues mentioned above.

When the game starts, turn to your right.  You will be stuck looking in this direction for the next 5 minutes or so until you complete the first part of the game.  You see, when you move the mouse to the right in a normal game to turn, you turn to the right continuously.  This is a special game, in which turning the mouse to the left stops when the mouse hits the ride side of the screen.  This means that you can only turn slightly to the left or right, and not at all behind you.  Think about it, this game was made with NASA's help, when through development and testing, and nobody thought it strange that you couldn't turn around.  Even if you could turn around this game would go from a -1 / 10 to a 1/10.  The game has you move to about 3 different areas and press a button.  You then solve some math problems, and move to about 2 more areas, and the game is over.
