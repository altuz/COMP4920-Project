Specifically, my virus protection read some file as a threat. It had never done that before, so I panicked and posted something angry because I am a hotheaded jerk on the internet. Well, the developer was on top of it in a flash...literally. My post was up for about 5 minutes before s/he calmly informed me of the obvious, which is that it was a false positive, evident by the fact that I was the only one reporting it. (I run a tight ship on my PC, but I do use a weird virus program...never had a problem before now.) S/he walked me through some steps, even sending me a replacement for the single file causing the trouble.Anyway, the game is great. But in our days of kickstarters and early access, it is a common sight to see developers and the communities at each others throats. I gotta support a team or individual who realizes that today, maybe unfortunately, game development includes a service aspect. And I was the irrate and unreasonable customer.10/10 Would buy from again."

The game was designed to be playable by multiple audiences, speedrunners, casuals, etc can all find enjoyment out of the game. It's designed to be a game you play while on a lunch break or between other playthroughs, and it really, truly is (which is fairly uncommon in my opinion). Great game. Stop reading. Buy it."
,Recommended,266110,16753410,"Posted: 27 June, 2015",all,Mean Mr. Mustard,"Tower of Guns is the best FPS / Procedural Death Labyrinth I've played.There is no hitscan, every weapon requires you to lead your moving targets, and every projectile can be dodged. You are very mobile, and upgrades you find in the tower will allow you to become even faster and stay airborne longer, if you're really lucky you'll be zipping around and rarely touching the ground.With each new run you'll chose a weapon and perk to start with. Weapon mods found in the tower will allow you to change how your weapon operates, such as giving it a shotgun spread or causing your projectiles to seek or bounce. These, in addition to the reusable items you'll find and various stat increases like health, speed, or jumps, give each run a unique feel, even when you start with the same build. If you're lucky you may even find new, unique weapons in the tower that operate unlike anything else you can start with.The tower is partly procedurally generated. Each floor you visit has a theme and you'll fight through a random assortment of rooms in that theme before fighting a boss. While the content of each room is random, the rooms themselves are handmade with a better sense of level design than you get with most procedural games, including secret areas and easter eggs.If you're like me and scour the levels for hidden items, a successful run will take about 35 minutes. You cannot save in the middle of the game so you'll need to finish it in a single run. Thankfully each run is fairly short and can lead to a very addictive one-more-try game session.Check this game out if you like old-school fast-paced shooters."

You've got an FPS game that actually has gunsnotmodeled off real-life weaponry, but instead over-the-top creative concepts. You not only have the ability to jump without needing to press your knees against a wall and vault over, but you can jump to your wildest dreams. No stop-and-pop cover-hugging here, get your♥♥♥♥♥out there soldier. Or grandmother. Or 80's gamer. Because even the storyline is randomly generated.I normally try to be fair and critical in my reviews, but I can't help but rave here. A little indie game took me in its arms and told me that FPS was still alive and circle-strafe-bunnyhopping in the clouds, and I didn't have to wait for it to come back down. I could pick up 3 jump height boosts and reach it in 7 jumps. It's taken me longer than planned to write this review, beacuse it was hard to pull away.Alright, minor rants. Some areas are too dark to easily spot enemies, but there's still more color variety than Borderlands. Twerp bots can be annoyingly hard to hit. I want to hold more than one gun. Some area generation can have bugs.Screw this, I'm back to playing it. I'd recommend it at full price for anyone that enjoyed Quake or Unreal games. Yes, Doom didn't have jumping, and I grew up on that game. But we had to learn to walk before we could centuple-jump. Enter the Tower already..."

The game moves fast and smooth, a necessity for this style of run-and-shoot twitch shooter, and plays equally well with KB+M or controller. Love the cel shaded artwork and the weird ""alien factory"" type design of the game world. There's also a good sense of humor that is thankfully never overdone. I had no idea what to expect in this one and it has turned out to be one of my favorite 2014 games to date, a half hour at a time adrenalin rush that I've kept installed on all my computers since the game was released."

On the surface, it looks like a sloppy college project of a game. The rooms are relatively simple, not much enemy diversity, low res textures, and only very little randomization to each run. HOWEVER. Pay attention to the dialogue (turn it on if you have it off), and trust me on this - Try and break the game. Just do it. Try and break out of rooms, try and explore beyond what the game wants you to. The developer actually wants you to do this - and has snuck messages outside the boundaries of various levels you can escape from telling you... Well, I don't want to spoil it. My point is, the developer knows the game is a tad sloppy, and has at least tried to make up for it with hilarious messages if you manage to break the game. Bonuses, even! It's encouraged!Also the game has a very PS1-era feel to it, which may turn more modern gamers away, but if your expectations are more geared for those low-poly, simpler games from days gone by, this hits all the sweet spots. Oh, and the music is goddamn fantastic. Catchy, will get stuck in your head, but not in a bad way. Also lots of lore if you really look into the dialogue as well, although each run has randomized ""stories"" which explain why the tower is there and why you're going through it, but the amount of depth in each one is amazing. Oh, and at random times the developer will step in and help you. For example, when starting your 5th run ever, you'll be transported to some extra-dimensional location and get some bonuses before you actually start the legit run, and a message by the developer saying thanks for sticking around this long.You can tell that there weren't many people who worked on the game, BUT you can also tell that those who did put every little ounce of character and love into crafting this thing. It's so easy to tell, and I've only had this game for a day. Can't imagine why anyone would not recommend this. $15 may be a little high, I'd shoot for $10 honestly, but I wouldn't say that's enough to say the game's bad. Cost doesn't determine how fun a game is... It just changes your expectations, I guess. I know it sounds harsh, but don't go in to this game with high expectations. Not that it's bad, but it's not revolutionary. Also, if you do, you might enjoy it more when the game surprises you and exceeds those expectations!"

He enlisted the help of another man to create one of the most kickass soundtracks in a game to date.I cannot stress enough that this is the work of one developer and one musician.  Is it because I'm about to say, ""Oh, this is pretty good for a small team.""?No.  This is not good for a small team.  This is nigh on black magic level for a single man and his brother-in-law.  If a full fledged STUDIO released this, I'd be giving it as much praise as I am now.  I can only imagine a sort of Faustian pact that enabled this game to be created.Enough gushing.  Let me elucidate a little bit on the mechanics that make this game so gosh darn fun.1.  Roguelike elements.  Permadeath, restart, randomly put together levels, perk unlocks and new guns to create a fresh feeling each playthrough.  The rooms in each level are handcrafted, and oh how lovingly handcrafted they are!  There are literally dozens upon dozens of secrets in each playthrough and they are DEVIOUS.2.  Shooting is fun - Guns?  Yeah, this game has some guns.  It's got your pistols, machine guns, shotguns, Mini-large hadron colliders, and guns that shoot bouncing spikey balls and glowing discs of death.  Wait.  What?3.  Weapon mods - Hey.  You have a rocket launcher.  What's this weapon mod do?  Oh.  It turns it into a machine gun rocket launcher.  That's pretty cool.  I like that.4.  Fast, Quake/Unreal style gameplay - It starts off a little slow, plinking away with your little basic gun of choice.  Then you start picking up badges (powerups), weapon mods, and items.  Pretty soon you're jumping fifteen feet in the air with only ONE of your jumps.  I've personally gotten up to six jumps in one game.  Double jump?  Pfft.  Triple, quadruple, and quintuple jumps are where it's at.  You'll be gliding around a massive, beautiful arena, firing your glowing, machine gun razor blade shooting pizza launcher at dozens of robots trying to murder you.5.  Boss Fights - Good lord.  Yeah, you got your Mama Spinbots, just bullet hell spinny robot death throwers that try to murder you through sheer brute force.  Then you've got the Egg Scrambler, the Gumball Machine, and Mr. Turret.  I cannot emphasize how cool the boss fights are.  The Egg Scrambler is one of my favorite boss fights in any FPS ever.  EVER.6.  It's ten dollars right now, fifteen at full price.  Come on.  If you liked old school shooters, you will want to make a sweet, sweet baby with Tower of Guns.Also, it's hilarious."

This game is a first person bullet hell, which is a difficult combination to find nowadays. It also incorporates some rouge-like elements, allowing you to collect and purchase loot in the form of upgrades and stat boosts. This in itself is fun, but one of the more enjoyable features of this game is the literal ton of secrets that can be found. Every room has a secret or two to unlock, and because of the randomized nature of the game i'm constantly finding new things on every playthrough. But whats all this mean without the gunplay. Shooting in tower of guns is chaotic and exaggerated. It doesn't take long for your screen to be swamped with bullets, missiles, and bombs. The downside to this is that your first five or so runs are mostly likely going to end in a quick death, as the game doesn't start you with very good weapons. Unlocking new guns should be your first priority, as progression past the first boss is almost impossible without it. The game lets you choose between dashing past enemies to the exit, or fighting it out in the search for power ups and loot. These sort of decisions become very important later in a run, as arming yourself is key to preparing for the next boss fight.Overall this game has a special charm to it. Being hand crafted as a co-op project between two brothers, you can see the love that has been pored into it. If you are a fan of bullet hell shooters, or simply want to try something different and don't mind a challenge, then you should defiantly check this game out."
,Recommended,266110,13173512,"Posted: 30 November, 2014",all,Chef Excellence,"Tower of Guns is a semi-procedurally generated ""lunch break"" FPS that's condensed the shooter genre to its utmost essence. Run, jump, strafe, shoot, try like hell to not die. That's really it. No game saves, no quickload, no plot beyond ""here's a tower full of murderous automatons, you want to be at the top."" And when you die your game is over and you must start a fresh run, which googling tells me is a genre called ""roguelike"".Not being familiar with roguelikes I can't speak to how good an entry it is in the genre, but my formative gaming experiences as a kid mostly consisted of plugging quarter after precious quarter into sadistically difficult arcade machines, hoping to unlock their secrets—or at least eke more than a few seconds' entertainment out of *this* playthrough before the inevitable failure because damn those machines were brutal. Tower of Guns definitely hearkens back to that philosophy, minus the quarters of course. It is punishingly difficult, requiring super-twitchy reflexes and an almost zen-like ability to strategize on the fly as a shload of happy projectiles come shrieking your way to give you a great big hug with nuclear arms. It's also therefore intensely rewarding when you do manage to reach the other side of an insane battle with your organs intact.If this sounds a bit grim and violent, well...it isn't. The cartoonish art design, lack of blood or gore (none at all to my recollection), and frequently black sense of humor running throughout encourage players to not take any of this seriously—even as the ever-increasing difficulty keeps the tension ratcheted up to 11.Seriously, I'm in love with this game. You can get it way cheap (> $5) during sales, but it's also well worth the purchase at full price."

You'll be going through dungeon to dungeon, shooting a bunch of stuff while avoiding ridiculously giant sized bullets and bombs.Tower of Guns feature a very interesting illustrative look when it comes to it's texture and overall style. If you've played the Borderlands series, it'll be very familiar to you. Visually the game scream with style and it'll probably be one of the more memorable elements to the game.My only complaints is that the button prompts are made for consoles, so when using keyboard and mouse in the PC, it's hard to tell what button you should push to activate the prompt. Also some of the audio feedback from your bullets connecting to enemies seem a underwhelming in comparison to the exaggerated and highly stylized explosion that it produces.Overall Tower of Guns is a pretty interesting take on the FPS genre. If you're into Quake or Unreal Tournament, but want a twitch based FPS with some roguelike flavors, then Tower of Guns should fullfill that need.Pros:- Wonderfully stylized aesthetic- Very replayable- Easy to understand and get into- Very twitchy and fast pacedCons:- Button Prompts set up for consoles and not PC- Some audio sound effects underwhelming"

The gameplay is fairly simple; shoot enemies, get their loot (money, item-energy, and occasionally upgrades), buy upgrades and new gear, fight a boss, rinse, and repeat.Many may find an issue with the game's admittedly limited level-generation. After enough attempts each run will quickly blur together, but even after 20 hours I was still finding new and substantial secrets within the game.ToG also has some of the most insane movement and weapon-capabilites out of any FPS i've played.

There is some small variation in level order, with each level made up of a series of several distinct rooms or 'chambers', which are again randomly selected from a pool. However, many of these rooms are similar and it will not take you long to become familiar with all of them.2) The game must be relatively shortI've reached the 5th level so far and, although this may be close to the end for all I know, it is still too far in to feel entirely happy about starting again from the beginning.3) The difficulty must be reasonable and consistent throughout.Now here is where the game utterly FAILS. For most of any particular playthrough of TOG, the difficulty is ridiculously easy. All you have to do is make sure you keep moving while keeping your finger on the fire button. Most of the 'enemies' in the game are in fact static turrets, that fire a bazillion intimidating-looking missiles in your direction, but at an unfeasably slow pace and with no sense of movement anticipation. Once you have the targets in your sights it is actually a pretty dull experience.However, due to to a certain portion of the enemies (turrets) spawning in random positions, there is often a moment of frenetic insanity when you first enter a room where you are bombarded from what seems like all directions. In most cases it just takes a split second to figure out where the barrages are coming from, find something to hide behind or which direction to move in to dodge the bullets, and it's a dull cakewalk again. But in that split second, if you find your view blocked by the ostensibly quaint, but actually quite obnoxious and distracting 2D smoke and explosion effects, and happen to run in the wrong direction, you are liable to recieve a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of damage all in the one moment and DIE. And start again. From the beginning. When it really isn't even your fault.The game has some quirky humour, plenty of easter eggs to find and a generally appealing steampunk-esque look and feel. But there is no point in this game where you feel your reflexes and cunning have helped you survive. Rather, it alternates between dumb luck when you enter a room and routine clean-up operations once you know where the guns are.I'd give it about 2-3 hours of gameplay before the novelty gives way to irritation, so not a very good deal."

So it's great even if you don't have much time to spare.The music is nice and suits the game very well but can be repetitve after a while.The gunplay is a bit boring due to the fact that you only use one gun (the secondary gun pickups are very rare) and the progression system is a bit too simple (only a few types of upgrades and 5 levels of gun power) compared to other randomly generated survival games (or rogue-lite). The weapon mods are fun (even if you are limited to one at the time...).The equipeble items got the largest variety and fun factor but they all seem weak and recharge very slow.While the graphics are not a huge priority for me in a game, the lack of colors is dull sometimes.

Beginning to think i'm one of the few people that would love to see something like this incorporated as an alternate mode in a lot of roguelike games.The main issue that i encounter with this game has to do with the upgrades, none of them feel significantly too particular, the vast majority of them are going to give more health, or more armor, or more damage, but there's none that change the game significantly, even the ones that you get for your weapon only, that change how your weapon behaves, while being cool, they're really hard to get, so you can get one that makes your bullets massive, combining the five bullets that your gun might fire, into a uniform shining amass of them, but again none of them really show up that often, and when they do you have to only choose one of them, i would have much rather prefer them to stack up creating strange combinations, something like that. The active items also tend to be really unbalanced, and poorly incorporated, you can have something like an item which makes you jump up high until you reach the ceiling without no control over yourself, something that was strangely useful later into the game, besides that the rest of them are only variatons of one, and other, you have one that shoots missiles, other one that shoots a very big, very slow, missile, or another one which protects you from damage while spawning cats around you.It's a shame that the power ups feel so random, and uninspired considering how good the gunplay actually feels, and frankly all things considered, for the ammount of people that actually design this game it's kind of impressive that it turn out as well as it did, despite all my complaints something happened yesterday as i was going to bed, i was about to fall asleep when all of the sudden i got the strange sensation, almost attraction, of playing this game, i just wanted to play it, i know it sounds weird, but it was just one of those things, i haven't felt about a game, any game for that matter, since a very long time, that sort of feeling that you get when you're reminicent about something you experience in the game, so you remember some of the game images, and all of the sudden it hits you, that old feeling, asking you to play it.This is that.A game that requires tweaks, as well as more upgrades that are actually significant, and fun, while at the same time retaining the same passion, art style, and gameplay of this one, i can only hope to see something like that for the next Tower of Guns, until now, i think this game has kept me busy long enough for me to be thankful of it's existence, as well as of me getting it in the first place."

It's always fun, very rarely frustrating, and offers a great level of replay. There are some unpolished bits, but nothing game breaking at all, and really nothing that detracts from the enjoyment of it. The controls are tight and responsive, the gameplay pacing has a good variation and buildup to it. Starts off a bit slow, but before long the screen is filled with fast-moving bullets. The weapons all feel different enough that none of them are redundant, though sometimes certain weapons feel a lot less useful. The randomization is great. It's different enough every time to be fresh, but has enough of the same that you can generally know what to expect. Even after around 20 hours of play I still come across rooms I've not seen before.The game is really simple. Pick up and play at it's finest. Can rush a playthrough in 20 minutes, or hang around and shoot everything and it'll take around 40-45. The most complex thing you'll find here is figuring out all the items and figuring out how to get some of the secrets. The dialogue is hilariously goofy and changes every playthrough.Really the only complaint I have about this game is having a dry spell of bad drops, or having it put an extra-jump badge just out of reach, like it's just sitting there taunting me.I definintely recommend the game. Tower of Guns is always enjoyable, gives a decent challenge, and has a unique charm to it I've not found anywhere else."

No run-through is the same and each time offers new challenges. Its a great testament to retro gaming of the 90s-2000s where storyline didn't matter and the challenge was what kept you playing. Though saying that, the storyline dialogues are funny and quite charming, if unconnected to the game.Overall 9/10.

You also can't save and come back later to finish the 'story'.Fun quake-style combat with lots of crazy power-ups, just leaves a little to be desired. If it had some more persistance, and better load-out options(maybe more RPG-ish) it would be worth the 15$ pricetag.

While a it does feel a bit floaty, it's easy to control what's going on at all times, and dodging bullets is made as simple as it can be in a game like this. The gun-leveling system keeps you on your toes and the fact that most of the enemies in the game are stationary or prefer to be in front of you means that it's unlikely you'll get overwhelmed from behind during all the mahem.The enemies and levels, while interesting and fun, are limited. And in a game with a rogue-like style of gameplay, this means that it falls a little short in the area of replayability. Not that the game doesn't have a fair amount of aspects making you want to come back for more, just in that you will reach a point where you've seen all there is to see.In summary, Tower of Guns is a game that took an interesting idea and made it not only playable, but legitimately fun, and easy enough to look at.

It has a relatively simple concept: you are in a tower which is filled with robots and turrets, and you need to fight through them to reach the top of the tower.There is permadeath, so if you die, you have to start again from the beginning, but this isn't as harsh as it sounds because a successful run will only last around 30 minutes. The difficulty is challenging, mostly because of the high number of enemies, avoiding them and their projectiles almost feels like a bullet-hell shmup. But FPS veterans should be able to handle it, especially after finding a loadout that suits your playing style. I only tend to die on the end of level bosses. They don't do much tactically, they just have a long health bar and do a ton of damage.At the start of each attempt you can choose one weapon and one perk. You can't change them without starting a new game, but you can collect powerups that change your weapon's abilities, for example spread shots or homing bullets. You can also find items that have a wide range of actions such as cancelling enemy bullets, or surrounding you with mines. And you can collect passive buffs for health, weapon damage, movement speed.There are around ten different weapons and perks, most of which are unlocked by performing actions in game like ""reach level x"" or ""kill x number of this enemy"". I unlocked most of them within the first 5 hours.Level design consists of pre-built rooms that are placed in a random order. You won't see every room on every playthrough, but after a few games you will start to see repeats. Progression from room to room is entirely linear.There is a much greater focus on gameplay than story. Each time you start a new game, you get a randomly selected storyline, they are amusing the first time you encounter each one, but they are all very basic and really just a fancy way of saying ""get to the top"".Graphics have a cartoonish style similar to Borderlands, and the music is pretty good. Controls work fine with mouse and keyboard. I haven't noticed any significant bugs. I like that there is a ""tilt"" function, where if you get stuck on a wall, you can hold a key for a few seconds to respawn, but I haven't needed to use it yet.Overall I like Tower of Guns. It doesn't do alot, but what it does, is enjoyable. However, at the moment I don't feel like there is a great deal of replayability. Some other short games that I've played, drew me back for another go by giving me some kind of goal, for example leaderboards. There is an endless mode, but its just more of the same. It looks like the developer is working on adding achievements, so hopefully that will help address this point.For now, I would recommend to pick up, but perhaps wait for a 50% off sale."

Without a speed up, theres a good chance itll curve around and flank you, therefore you must cause it to collide with an enemy or the terrain. With the speed up you can outrun it if you stay mobile.-The gun mods give each weapon great replayability. While you might not like the slow firing but powerful crossbow, the rapid fire or spreadshot mods could change the weapon to fit your playstyle.- Pickup Items are very varied and show up often enough that you're bound to find one you like on each playthrough.- This game has A really high replayability value. Once you beat the game, get all the guns, and get the perks you can activate endless mode to fight increasingly difficult floors. If you get tired of that, then activate RTD mode, where each floor has a different modifier that could help or hurt you. There could even be a secret boss if you look hard enough.- The weapon selection you get covers every time of gun from machine gun to shotgun. But there are also guns you can get randomly throughout playing. My favorite gun really motivates me.-Level design really makes use of the momemtum of the game, and the same room layout doesn't always have the same secrets( with the exception of one filled with love).  this gives an added feeling of satisfaction when exploring a room.- the music and the artsyle of this game really compliment each other very well.Cons:-While I do enjoy the feel of the guns they are energy weapons. therefore instead of a BANG the shotgun makes a mixture of a puff and air and a BZZT. This is a pretty nitpicky con and only applies to a personal level, but I prefer the sound of bullets and shells over engery cells.I wholeheartedly recommend this game."

76561198170220230,Recommended,266110,28695965,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Winston,"For the most part, the gameplay is like a first person bullet hell shooter mixed with a classic fps gameplay (e.g. Doom, Quake). However, people just looking for that classic FPS gameplay may be dissapointed. The game has roguelike elements like permadeath and progression that carries through all of your runs in the form of unlocking new guns and perks to use. Also, for a majority of runs, you will only be able to attack by firing your only gun, which you pick before each run with infinite ammo and no alternate attacks.There is also no keycard hunting like in first person shooters from the 90s and the structure of the levels is similar to other roguelikes like The Binding of Isaac Rebirth or Enter the Gungeon. Where there is a floor made up of procedurally generated rooms and the floor boss room which must be beaten to proceede to the next floor.Your equipment is also similar to roguelikes. You start out with your one attack (in this case a gun) and a perk that you pick before each run that will affect the gameplay. For example, one perk will give you immunity to fall damage, while another will give you the ability to triple jump. You can also pick up an activatable item which will also affect gameplay and you can pick up perks for your gun that will change it. For example, one gun perk can make your gun fire at a extremely fast rate and another can make your gun fire a spread of bullets like a shotgun. These items can be bought in the rooms within a level or can be obtained after defeating the floor's boss.Levelling your stats and trying to find a good mix of equipment is essentially to a good run. You can find several stat upgrades in each floor that increase your max health, number of jumps, jump height, and more.With this all said, Tower of Guns does retain some core game mechanics that make it feel like a classic fps. There is no health regen, cover mechanics, or a story that interrupts your gameplay. However, there are secrets and secret levels and cheat codes and you can upgrade to the point where you have like 67 jumps and move ridiculously fast. You can also obtain other guns in game but not that often.I love this game because it combines old school fps gameplay with roguelike elements and is also a first person bullet hell shooter. I love that there are so many different game modes you can play. And most of all, I love that after over 200 hours of play and 100 percenting the game-- I still haven't found all of the secrets in the game."

Completely worth it for any FPS fan.Tower of guns is a procedural/roguelike game where your goal is simple: fight your way to the top of a tower loaded with robotic armaments and dangerous environments.  It's an FPS game you can play in an hour or less, much less when you get killed, and delivers a purity of gameplay that's extremely well done.  In short, it's a giant shooty 3D FPS obstacle course creator, that's all it does, and it does it well.Different unlockable weapons and play modifiers ensure you can try different loadouts, while the randomized order of rooms, enemies, drops, items, weapon mods, stores, and even bosses makes sure the game is fresh.  On top of that many rooms have secrets you can try and find, and some of them are pretty well hidden to judge by my low find rate and embarassingly fruitless wall-bumping searches.Also, on top of the value, the game delivers an extra level of parody - the plot is randomized as well.  So one time you're a secret agent dog, another time you're a waitress on the run from zombies, or you may even be the developer and his brother chatting.  The humor is quite witty and is the finishing polish to a great gameThere's few issues, mostly a bit of clipping now and then.  Nothing to complain about.Tower of guns is a bargain - randomized, fun, funny, and challenging FPS action you can play over and over.  Completely worth the money."

Despite my personal misgivings about the various videos I've seen of this game, I thought I'd give it a try due to the amount of positive reviews it has. I understand this was only made by two people, but to me that isn't a good enough excuse for making such a lazy, uncreative game. Many solo projects have been amazing (Braid, Dust, etc.). The comparisons made to Binding of Isaac and Doom are utterly ridiculous. I haven't played much of Isaac, but it has that undeniable style of Team Meat and a recognisable personality. Doom had incredibly satisfying weapons and varied enemies with cool death animations, as well as a haunting atmosphere (at least for the time). This game has none of that. The guns are♥♥♥♥♥♥poor in terms of 'feel' and lack that punch which can make or break an FPS. Sound design goes a long way in this regard, which this game is also terrible at. The gun sounds are muted and flaccid, and the music goes horribly crackly and distorted at certain times. When enemies die, they all explode in the exact same fashion, regardless of their size, in a shower of stock UDK particle effects and sounds. There is no personality in the game either. The textures are all a horrible poor-man's Borderlandsy style and the 'humour' in the game just falls incredibly flat (HUGBOTS??? LOL LOL THE CAKE IS A LIE). I cannot for the life of me figure out how this got so many positive reviews - perhaps people simply feel the need to support small indie teams? The only other reason I can think of is that the reviewers had been chained in a dark basement for 20 years and this was their first stimulus after emerging."

Amazing concept right?As sarcastic as that last sentence sounded, this is actually a pretty good concept and a well executed one! Tower of Guns is a game where you play an unnamed male character (judging from grunts and what not) who enters ""The Tower of Guns"". It's that over sized tower with all the guns on it y'know it totally isn't the pinnacle of the entire game or anything.ANYWAY this unnamed male character enters the Tower and fights through 5 randomly generated stages to complete one of the random storylines designated to you, unless you turned the silly stories off you sad sad person. Entering the tower you get the decision between a weapon you've unlocked and a perk, the starting weapons and perks are effective so don't be shunned by the unlock system!Gameplay wise ToG (Tower of Guns) plays out like a typical quake shooter, you move fast, you shoot a gun at mounted guns or mobile guns depending on your luck on enemy spawns (Dang twerp bots...) and you progress through the levels, levelling your gun up, defeated bosses and collecting power ups and possibly more guns and secrets...if you look hard enough.Overall the concept of Tower of Guns is relatively simple and despite the hard to imagine concept is performed successfully.

Tower of guns is a fantastic fast paced shooter, and is a serious test of reflexes. The sheer number of enemies trying to shoot at you at once can very quickly become overwhelming if you fail to react. The levels are, while mostly indoors, incredibly spacious and provide a good area to explore (as well as containing a massive amount of hidden rooms, mazes, and in some cases whole levels!)My one criticism for ToG is a lack of content. While trying to find 100% of the secrets will keep you searching forever, the number of gouns your character can start with is somewhat limited. It should be noted that you are intended to find more guns as the game progresses, however these are very rare and most of the time you will have to complete the game with the gun you start with (although by that point it will be heavily upgraded from all the pickups.)While it may not last you as long as some other games, I feel ToG is well worth trying for a very enjoyable FPS."

Then get ready for the ride of your life!Tower of Guns is an indie made game that was recently published earlier this March after a year in being developed. In it, your only objective is to make your way through 15 floors to the top of the tower. Sounds easy? Well it would be, if it wasnt for all the guns trying to mow you over. Each floor is randomized, giving you the element of surprise and wonder as bullets, saw blades plasma, spikes, cannons and a whole lotta other stuff tries to kill you. At the end of each floor, you face down a boss, which is also randomized. Hopefully you dont take death too seriously, because not only will it happen, but you are tallied for it to boot. Its not like death is important or anything, right? :DThis doesnt mean you are entirely weak. Items and powerups you may find from beaten bosses, enemies, or capsules you cant open without enough money (also beaten from enemies) will offer a variety of upgrades to you or your weapon, which are also randomized. Sometimes you might score a good one, sometimes you wont, and sometimes you wont find any. The more you play, the more you can unlock. Collect all the different gun abilities, achieve perks and guns depending on what you do, level up your gun by collecting the blue orbs and stay alive by collecting the red orbs from fallen enemies, and get to the top of that tower!Tower of Guns is a thrilling rush for its worth. I highly recommend taking it for a spin, because if the whole ""Tower of Guns"" thing doesnt appeal to you, you really are missing out dear viewer. Just remember to never be a sitting duck and keep your eyes open for anything. Theres a lot of flashing and a lot of bullets coming your way, so be ready for the biggest barrage from all sides coming your way! Also, be creative; You arent given any sort of instructions on ""how to play"", so if you see something interesting, follow up on it, it might take you to a secret, and there are a lot of secrets on each floor.So go buy it. Do it! Do it now!"

It's a rogue like, randomized levels, enemy spawns, loot, and gets crazy difficult at any moment. But instead of being a top down shooter or a Diablo esque RPG, Tower of Guns is a fully fledged first person shooter, with the game mechanics geared towards the more retro side of things. Basically, It's Serious Sam meets Binding of Isaac. And this lovebaby is one heck of a rockstar.The visual presentation is unique and varied, the cel shaded effect is quite nice and makes the incredible amount of things you'll be seeing on screen a lot easier to process. Every enemy is unmistakable in design, even if their textures are a little drab for my taste (request to developers, Fruity Textures Mode plz) The sound is zesty, guns sound intentionally weak at first, but sound awesome the more they level up.Level design is linear but not confined or simple. Multiple elevated areas, loads of secrets and various ways to cross chasms. They are even comparable to levels from Portal. Typically there are 3 to 4 rooms then a boss room. It's quite intuitive and allows you to gauge how hard the level will be.My only complaint with the game so far is the physics are wonky. Some of the platforming objects just do not work correctly. For example, the cog wheels with the platforms, Sometimes it lets you jump off them, sometimes it doesn't. Some objects like pipes and such end up being phased through a lot, which can make reaching some secret and high up areas impossible if the game doesn't like you that run.Weapon designs are unique and varied. They all level up to be more powerful, and they all suit different styles of play and preference.I rate the game so far an 8/10. I've yet to unlock Endless Mode, which is sure to be a treat."

But I'll just stick to the pros and Cons.Pros:+UT2k4-ish movement and controls. High air control, double jumping, etc.+Risk-of-Rain-esque difficulty scaling. Basically, don't kill hugbots, get difficulty-- when possible, make life easier on yourself. It'll get crazy hard eventually.+Great feeling Guns (eventually, not your initial 2, but the following ones are quick to get)+Acheivements/statistics - You know how you did, and you know what you're going for.+Weapon modifiers are fantastic!+Bonus levels for major achievements with significant power ups--- Some go crazy.+Randomly selected storylines are pretty funny, and they are per 'run' and have internal continuity.Meh:Music is Ok, and gets the job done. Some music is great and fits the mood darn near perfectly (Hugbot Alley) but others just suffice/At times, too chaotic. 50 spike balls flicking everywhere can be stressful. But its also a pro in that you need to change your approach, and either get the hell out of dodge and blitz through ignoring enemies (you don't have to kill any to proceed) or take it slowCons:-Some balancing issues? Some items don't feel useful. Others seem unclear in how they will help you.-Some repetitive enemies, There is only 1 mobile ground based non-boss enemy (that i have seen)-It is unclear if there are any benefits to high difficultyOverall? So far, 5/5, @ 50% 'total' completion with 5 hours played, I have beaten the game once.The gameplay matters, and this game delivers.

Items you have to activate you can hold 1 at a time and when you hold 1 and pick up another, the old one falls onto the floor and can be picked up again and the new one has a full charge, so you can try the new one and if you don't like it, you can switch back to the old one. Making the game much more forgiving towards people that don't know what all the items do.  It also allows you to choose your favorite weapon and perk off at the beginning so it feels like you have a little more control of your character then other rogue likes.The game is quite good looking for an indie game, looks fairly modern, pleasing to the eye imo. Also, the options menu provides a decent array of options, maybe a little lacking in mouse sensitivity settings. Although the options menu cant be accessed in the middle of a game and you can only move the option in 1 direction, so if you want to go backwards you have to move in a circle.The Bad:Something like 20 deaths and i've beaten level 5 boss twice. (final boss unless you play in endless mode). When i played past level 5 in endless mode, the level 6 boss seemed unfair. Giant lava pit that you need to jump across, if you don't have enough jumps, you're dead. It is hard to call the game too easy because there are certainly perks and guns that it would be more difficult to do well in. The problem is there is no incentive i know of to push me to use more difficult settings unlike something like binding of isaac where you had to use the weaker characters to unlock certain things.You can only have 1 weapon mod active at a time so you don't see insane combos like you do in other rogue likes. Just 1 weapon mod, then everything else is just a straight up passive health, speed, jump, or damage buff."

""Where's my roguelike shooter, ""Bob""?  My roguelike racer?  My roguelike rollercoaster sim!""  Maybe a week after I made that joke, this came out (or at least to my attention) and then every genre got rogue-ified.This is almost exactly what you think it is: a respectable mashup of a first-person arena shooter, bullet hell, and roguelike.  Pewpew or dakkadakka endless amounts of turrets and robots for hundreds of menial upgrades, which quickly add up to a decent upgrade.  In terms of humor, it doesn't take itself very seriously, which is light-hearted and fun.  Your randomly generated ""storylines"" reveal that swiftly.  The gameplay and levels themselves show that they are seriously well-crafted however.  Personally, it's one of those games you can pick up for half an hour or so every once in a while and romp through some scrap metal with the gun and perks of your choosing, though if you are more interested in a deeper experience, there are things like endless mode and self-imposed handicaps.  If you're an FPS player this game will feel right at home right away, you just have to acclimate to what kind of items, skills, and guns you like.All in all the game feels nice and definitely has love put into it.  The graphics and environments vary a little, and usually it's simple and clean.  It's a bit reminiscent of Borderlands' style (that intentionally scrappy and ""junk"" look).  It's hard to go into detail about anything else because much of it is preference or spoilery - what kind of upgrades and guns are good for example.

I have maxed out my max health, maxed out all of my weapons, of which I keep getting more of, and I have at least $1700 in random coins. I tote a shotgun that always crits, a pan flute-shaped machine gun, a little ""Rubber Band Gun"" that lets me pull myself in any direction as far as I want, and a fast firing, ricochet-ing, quad laser, always critting, book-with-straws-sticking-out-of-the-pages looking thingie with massive ""Uber"" projectiles, and a little device that at least triples my firing speed. Did I mention that I hit like a small truck and the difficulty has to be in the thousands now, and enemies move super fast, hit hard, have fast bullets and fire often, but it doesn't matter since I can spam forever and not have to worry about it, since my loot magnetism brings all the health and xp pickups to make up for almost any mistake, and that this is a run-on sentence?Who am I? Well, according to the in-game story, I'm playing as a confused, presumably middle-aged man who got lost on a trip to his wife's aunt's place and is taking a ""short cut"" because they need to be there soon for some reason.I couldn't have made all of this up if you gave me a whole week to do so.Silliness aside, I will warn you, the game is basically a rouge-like Quake, with ten times the verticality, and it isn't perfect, you will get bounced around uncontrollably sometimes thanks to certain projectiles having collision similar to that of the rooms themselves. Also, it's really unforgiving, and doesn't really work as a game that you can binge on for the next month and a half, treat it as something to occupy you on your lunch break, if you can even get it to work on anything short of a modest gaming PC. My laptop is rather beefy for laptop standards (it's not the best, but it runs the games I play well), and I still drop frames occasionally, due to the sheer amount of bullets, spikey balls, bombs, spinbots, misiles and, mines that are everywhere in the later levels."

You run around really fast and shoot things and dodge tons of projectiles and collect power-ups to make yourself better, and when you die you can alter your loadout and start all over again. It's a good formula, and though it has some hiccups, there are a lot of fun elements.The gameplay feels nice. It's quite floaty and weightless, but that fits with the large, expansive levels and movement required to avoid all the enemy attacks. A lot of the powerups are dedicated to increasing the time the player spends in the air, including speed, jump height, and a seemingly unlimited number of possible midair jumps.The art style is very hand-drawn-y, which I personally don't like all that much, but not enough to get really annoyed by it.There're infinite enemies, but you have infinite ammo, so there's no problem.The game has a very goofy sense of humor, which mostly comes across in the variety of possible randomly selected stories each game can have. They don't really change anything, but they recontextualize the gameplay in funny ways. You can be a young woman trying to claim her inheritance, a goo monster trying to escape a laboratory, a thinly disguised Terminator pastiche, or an old couple with an astonishingly faulty GPS. It's charming, and I'm glad it was implemented.There's a really pleasant piano soundtrack that escalates with gameplay wonderfully.The spikey ball launchers can ♥♥♥♥ right off, as can the Egg Scrambler boss.The game crashed or froze a lot for me, which was goddamn annoying when it interrupted gameplay. I'm not sure if this is an issue for anyone else, though, so take that with a grain of salt.Overall, Tower of Guns is a lot of fun. The gameplay's engaging, it's charming and funny, and apparently one guy made just about all of it by himself, which is always good to see. I recommend it."
