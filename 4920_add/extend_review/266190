I couldn't click on  anything and had to kill the game in Task Manager.2nd Game:Got past the character creation, but game locked up on loading. Had to kill it in TM again.4th, 5th, 6th, 7th games:Spawned below the earth each time, couldn't move, couldn't do anything, but fall. Even though I was in window mode, cursor was locked to screen. Hit crtl-esc, tried to close the window, cursor got locked back to screen again. Had to kill it in TM.Also each time I went back into the game , I had to redo my settings, since nothing got saved.9th Game:Took atleast 5 minutes to create the world. Once again I spawned under the world and couldn't do anything. Also learned that once you pull up the help menu you can't close it, and then you can't do anything but exit out of the game.10th game:Same problem as 1st game.11th game:Was able to play, but no sound. Was unable to havest any resources what so ever.Gave up at this point and requested a refundThis game is way too EA to even be on Steam! It's just unplayable.Added Note:You're selling your game here on Steam. Therefore you get rated on how it currently is, not how you think it will be.Update: I was happy to get this game refunded. I had a lot of gammer mistakes, I was extremely annoyed at buying this game and finding it in this sorry state. Also removed my foul language."

I have a good gaming system, but the framerate will never go higher than 8-10 pfs. this makes the gameplay choppy and irritating, even with the settings at the lowest they can be.  with 3.1 ghz quad core processor, 12 gigs of ram, and a new nvidia, i should not have a problem on the lowest setting.  Some work on the speed and this will be a really fun game. :-)"

Doesnt seem to be any requirement for ingredients yet.The blocks all look really nice.Otherwise it seems to still be in alpha stage.  It crashes frequently.  Laggy as hell.I built a pond with the terra forming tools, it was pretty cool."

I like some of the building and RPG features but the game still lacks in the content area. Some controls are pretty standard while others take some time getting used to. There is a little tip UI on the tools so that helped. Get it on sale if interested, probably not enough game here for the full $15 but $10 might be fair. I wish they would take some of the mechanics from Creativerse - if they could make the control more smooth and add more content I think that would be good. I like the look of the game, hopefully they can spend some more time on the mechanics."

This edit is just a personal opinion, but if you are wondering if this project is worth some of your money... I'm sure it isn't by now./end edit and rantOnly buy if you really want to support the devs,to me the game is not playable, controls are very unintuitive at the moment(mostly the terraforming).Equipping a shovel you can only dig down, so making a cave requires terraforming.Sometimes I can't place a farm, not sure what the conditions are.Sometimes my char gets stuck in chopping corn animation, requiring quitting the game.The physics are very unrealistic. Trees fall down when you harvest them a couple times,would prefer a savage lands approach where you chop them, they fall,and then you chop them up. Same for animals, they die, corpse dissolves into resources.Would be nice if the corpse would remain a bit, and you could choose to skin / gut it.In my opinion, I don't know how big their team is,but I fear 1 year from now this game will only be early access,not a finished product, but (hopefully) I might be wrong.Still I don't recommend it at this stage,I'd wait at least for a full procedural world generation.My bad, after restarting my map terrain generation seems to have picked up a bit,it's still unresponsive at times though, letting you reach the end of the world.So I'll change my comment to : wait for better optimization,or a faster pc 2-3 years from now."

It might be a bit rough around the edges at the moment, but the core gameplay is there. Terraforming the environment is especially a great mechanic.

Controls are bit off for my taste and would love to rebind my movement keys. I like the fantasy setting and went to read about lore of the game.

,Recommended,266190,23596531,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,firebloom,"I really bad want to like this game, but everything is so ""fussy"" right now.My first game was with the ""too far away"" bug and spent 20 minutes trying to figure that out.I'm finding it hard to hit rock or a tree and then have to hunt around for the dropped objects. It would be better if the objects simply went in your pack.  You need a lot of mats, but can't get many from each resource.  And stuff only seems to stack to 60.The same music over and over is slightly irritating. I think the music should have different flavors depending on what you're doing; fighting music vs. exploring music and there should be more of it.Moving is just funny.  The animations are very stiff.  Apparently only the WASD keys move you.  The mouse turns you so I wind up doing 3 stooges type circles before moving forward - every time I want to move forward.I killed 3 large angry people, 2 dogs, and 1 deer.  Lost all the loot on one of the angry people because he died on a steep slope.  One of the dog things exploded and I never found that loot. Fighting just needs it's own chapter of overhauls.  You CAN kill things with your one spell and I saw a little stone sword in the crafting but didn't bother making one.  The spell works.  Hit whatever it is while you're backing up and spamming the spell.I like the sound the water makes, but I can't see the water.  I really love the map too, even the glitchy stuff makes things more interesting.I'm stuck on the blacksmithy because I can't find coal. Yet.  When we're digging, wouldn't we find coal?Digging is odd. Rather than taking out a chunk from the surface you're clicking on, it digs directly down beneath you.I got to the ""edge"" of the map and the new area won't appear. I'm hoping that coming out and  going back in will make it draw in the missing parts.I think this game has a lot of potential and I like it overal. It just needs a whole lot of tweaking.Would I buy the game knowing what I know now?  I would, but if you're a person who needs everything to work right off the bat, you might want to check back in 6 months."
,Not Recommended,266190,27990923,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,janarah_caine,"This game starts out with some very fine graphics, though, that may be where all of the good things end.The controls for this game, especially in reguards to creation/editing are very much a pain to mess with. It seems more like the creator of this game decided to let the players have a go at the actual game engine/creation mechanics, instead of actually finishing the game and all of it's mechanics.The basic crafting seems to be difficult to get a handle on, to the point that there are no real tutorials in game or explination of how to do anything. It's basically trial and error.The combat system is juvinile at best, with the favor being in the enemies hands it seems. I can recall old 80's nes games which had a more advanced and balanced combat system over this one's pick something and hope it fires/works/or even selects during combat.Building buildings, I can't say much about this since I coudl only ever manage to get some corners made and even then it was increasingly difficult to place/stack them. The construction system of this game is. . .for lack of better words, crap.The creation menu, well, if I wanted to build a game world from scratch and were using a game editor interface then this would be fine. But, I doubt anyone enters into a game/game world and expects to have to actually make roads, cities, etc all on their own because the creators didn't take the time to set anything up.The conversation/store/npc system is. . .severely lacking. You can't tell friend from foe, and typically when trying to talk to an npc you simply just swing at them.As for money, well, no idea how you come across that. So, buying the over priced things at the one or two npc's I managed to find were impossible. They would sell you things but would buy nothing, so, you can get the idea out of your head that there is any real economy with in this game.Movement and navigation is choppy at best, controls aren't set up for any sort of easy navigation, and camera views are more of a pain to adjust than moving."

I'm all for indie developers putting their stuff out into the world, but you guys may have bitten off a bit more than you can chew.The controls are just... bad. Slow, confusing, and poorly designed - they need optimization, as does the rest of the game. I mean, you have to go back into your inventory to reassign a tool to a hotkey after you use it? Are you... are you serious with that?The visuals are early 2000s, which is fine, you know, whatever... Minecraft and Shovel Knight have primitive looking visuals, and are both fun and charming. This is... neither. The cahracters look straight out of Asheron's Call, and that's not a compliment. Visual design needs either a proper cohesive theme, or it needs a complete redesign - either way, I'm on board.That's the thing with Astral Terra - I can see what the devs are shooting for, and the view is pretty neat... but there's just not enough here yet.And, yeah - I know I only have a few minutes in game. It doesn't take very long to get turned off by poorly done controls and stale visuals. I'm still reccomending this one, though, because I think it might be really neat... someday. Just not today."

Granted, it's an alpha right now, so there's going to be some things about the game that needs to change.My suggestions would be...Fullscreen Windowed option. Most games have it, and it'd be an utter shame if this game didn't. Trust me, your players will love you for the option! (It's always the first thing I look for to make sure it's on.)Cancel button on Settings Configuration, just in case we screwed something up and don't want to face the ultimatum of ""Quit Game"" or ""Apply"".Camera speed option, and perhaps an option to keep it regulated so that it doesn't start off as a slow crawl to a sudden lurching, motion-sickness inducing whizzing across the screen, haha.Hotkey reconfiguration. This is important in that it allows for players to fall into hotkeys and habits they're familiar and comfortable with. Most importantly, it allows for players who are brand new to the game to peruse the hotkeys and see what the default hotkeys are in game. (For example, I never would have guessed that Q, normally a Strafe Left movement button would be the Descend function.)Allow for players to zoom out of first person if they so wish in Build Mode. Being forced to first person is very disorienting and doesn't allow for the player to gage scaling.Allow players to adjust volume of various things, not just master volume. I must shamefully admit I'm not a fan of the music, but I'd still want to hear the environmental sounds; there's no option for this, however. It's all or nothing right now. Similarly, breaking down the settings to multiple categories would be advised for organizational purposes.Speed up the scrolling speed of Build Mode's texture selection. I'm not sure if the developers have tested this particular function, but it's ridiculously slow, borderline frustrating.Have the movement keys (WASD) move the camera as well. Having to hold down the right mouse button to figure out we're unintentionally running our character's off a cliff isn't a good thing!Character customization! Is there any at the character creation screen? I'm not too certain, but I believe not. It's a little disheartening, but I assume this will become a later feature. If there is indeed character customization in this build, it's very well hidden.Have Stamina be a bit more reasonable. Within four minutes of standing around figuring out controls and settings, my Stamina was entirely depleted. Seems rather silly having it go away so soon, perhaps extend it to over the course of an hour? I'm not certain what purpose it holds, but if its anything important, this game would be unplayable.Warning before deleting/throwing away objects by dragging off the window. Hooo boy.That's all I can think of off the top of my head. Looking back on it, wow I piled 'em up. Keep up the fantastic work. I might update this later with more suggestions, but these are the most prominent that surface to mind. Unfortunately, as of this review's current state (November 2016) I would not recommend this game until all of these factors have been improved upon."
