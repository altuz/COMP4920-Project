,Recommended,266250,9311663,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,Aussiedroid,"Not sure when Shoot 'Em Ups became Shmups (sounds more like 'Schmucks' to me), but anyways perhaps the brevity is more appropriate for Procyon since it is very short at only 5 levels. For veteran Shoot 'Em Up players out there you might find Procyon less challenging than some of the brutal contenders currently on the market, but that's not to say that it is not an enjoyable experience.Graphically, it looks sharp with high def effects & backdrops (no 8-bit look here) with sound effects & soundtrack holding strong too. Comes together very well. Controls are intuitive, allowing you to switch between your standard wide bullets to your concentrated beam weapon in an instant. The weapon & shield system implementation was one of the strong points for me. The weapons are linked into your shields and when combined offers a power-up damage to clear your path ahead. Beam weapon also arcs & bends which is a nice effect and allows you to still move around somewhat without loosing out on damaging your target.For those that don't skip through the mini-story cutscenes there is also some humour to be had (worth watching through at least once).On the negative side, I did find the boss fights a bit average; not bad but not really exciting either. Also an online co-op mode would have been awesome so I could play with friends around the world. With the duality in the weapons I could see online co-op being a lot of fun! Also, as I said earlier the game is very short. The 5 levels took me about 30 mins to complete first time through (and that was watching the cut-scenes!). Thankfully there is replayablity with higher difficulty levels in Attrition (5 lives + 1 per level completed) & Survival (1 life only!) to conquer.For the price, overall quality & fun factor of this little title, this still gets a 'Thumbs Up' from me.If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"

I played the game for quite a while, but today I saw that it has just come out on Steam, so I bought it instantly. Procyon is a very nicely polished game, with pretty visuals and some really nice gameplay, especially on higher difficulty levels. The story is also quite entertaining, as you will figure out just after watching the first scene. In Procyon there is a wide variety of different enemies, all with their very own way of attacking you, aswell as a boss at the end of every level. Of course the boss is also different depending on the level, so gameplay is not repetitive and the pretty nice soundtrack adds a good layer of extra polishment to the game. I do definitely recommend it, at least to everybody who either likes this genre, or to people who just really enjoy funny cutscenes. :)"

The amazing orchestral soundtrack uses one characteristic and short motive in all stages.Even the hilarious background story is thought provoking and really well written: "" We are humans, we're REMARKABLY GOOD at fighting and we fought back / Unfortunately, we're humans. We are REMARKABLY BAD at ressource management!""This game for this ridiculous low price deserves your attention. It's deeply accessible, features easy / hard modes and therefore it will please casual players and even veterans.I can't praise enough the hard work of Josh Jersild, the developer of this little gem.This guy did all the programming, the hilarious voiceovers, the great score and the modeling / texturing ON HIS OWN in his spare time but this game that easily stands out from the rest doesn't feel like homebrew.Just check the other reviews on the store page! This tasty, delicious cake can hardly be a lie!!"

76561197995603740,Recommended,266250,25699433,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,staticrodent,"This is a very short game, only 5 levels. At 1 hour I finished each stage on normal difficulty. The art is also somewhat lackluster, the ship is downright boring which is a cardinal sin for a space shooter. The game is saved, however, by interesting mechanics and a hilarious satirical narrative between missions. I picked up this game for half-price at $2 and consider it worth the investment.The mechanics are pretty fun. Use your shield to block all enemy attacks (but not enemies themselves), but you must meter your usage so you don't run out when you need it. Using your shield also powers up your attack, so there's parts when you'll want to use some of your shield power to take out extra enemies (assuming you're going for a high score). The shields go up at the same time you power your attack, so there's not a trade-off between using your power for shield or using your power to power-up your attacks, which may have been more interesting.There are three types of attacks, a spread shot (for lots of small enemies), which will spread more when powered up, a tracer beam (for larger enemies and bosses), which will do more damage when powered up, and a lightning attack that will do massive damage but has a separate gague that needs to be filled by killing enemies.More game time can be had by playing on higher difficulties and chasing a high score for the leaderboards."

It took about 5 hours to beat. For $4, you can keep a game that would probably cost about $4 worth of quarters to play through one time at the arcade.Pros: Good music, nice graphics, hilarious dialogueCons: Hard game. Not casual whatsoever. Fairly short."

,Recommended,266250,9350768,"Posted: 5 March, 2014",all,Radical CJ,"(STRONGLY RECOMMEND)For me, the “side-scrolling spaceship shooter” is a game genre that invokes an ambiguous response.In one hand it offers addictive simplicity and nostalgia. In the other an absolute lack of narrative and gameplay conventions so well entrenched that it is almost impossible to distinguish any two examples of the genre from one another… also often little room for developing a strategy beyond mashing the attack button.While obviously “retro” in many respects, Procyon is not a slavish tribute to early scrolling shooter games. Rather, the conventions have been bent for the players benefit.The various modes and three tier difficulty setting allows the player as much, or as little, challenge as they desire. A ‘Practice Mode’, for example, allows a level to be played with unlimited lives, although this does not unlock the next level.The graphics are also nice and 3D looking rather than “ironically” pixelated.Lots of explosions and a large variety of alien spacecraft, all with different flight patterns and attacks.The controls are simple and intuitive and the spaceship is highly mobile allowing you to dodge enemy attacks and move quickly around all over the screen. The weapon/shielding compromise system also gives you something to think about as expending your energy on supercharging your weapons leaves you unable to deflect attacks. Different enemies are also more or less vulnerable to the players two (or three if you count the lightening) weapons, so button mashing is not rewarded, “use ya noggin”.What I particularly enjoyed were the cut scenes establishing a satire narrative between the levels.It’s a short game (5 levels only), but it’s highly replay-able and considering that it only costs $3.00 or something its very good value for money."

Everything is responsive and smooth, the essential ingredients for a shooter.  It is essentially a game where you swap weapons and time your shield.   Visuals are excellent and the audio is typical shooter style music.  The cheesy narration by your commander is a bonus.  Highly recommended for quick fix shooter fans."

First off it works perfectly on my stereoscopic 3D rig using Tridef Ignition, second it's got a really clever sense of humor and mostly the gameplay is exciting, by parts riveting, and provides a very high level of challenge while not discouraging the player from trying again.The visuals are incredibly appealing, especially in stereo 3D; stereo will normally help player's situational awareness and despite the ""2D-ness"" of this title, the 3D brings the exact same quality - the separation between foreground and background helps keep you aware of all objects on the gameplay's plane/layer. It makes it look even purdier, too! :-)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWDFLzADAeQ* Warning: Steam though it would be a good idea to break all stereoscopic videos. Head to YT to watch it, make sure you are using Flash, not HTML5."
