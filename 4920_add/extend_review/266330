Clear time, fragments collected, and pauses used.- 3 worlds with many stages. The game is hard enough to make you spend a lot of time trying to beat it.(I spent an hour on a stage once...)- Lots of replayability for every stage due to built-in challenges for low clear time, fragments collected, minimal pauses used and leaderboards.- Physics are well done. Momentum needs to be manipulated as well. Tons of possibilities.- Multiple ways to complete stages.- In-game art/graphics are decent.- Animations are smooth.- Quick restarts, instant respawns.- Controller support(though I prefer KB/M on this game)- Sound effects are decent 3/5. They don't bother me.- Music never got annoying, I never felt like I had to turn off the music, even after many hours of playing.- Steam Card drops.- Has achievements(better than none)- No RNG. This is great news for speedrunners.(This would be an entertaining game to see speedruns of, it's like Super Meat Boy)- No bugs from what I've seen so far.(Aside from a tiny one with the restart dialogue popping up continuously if you spam the confirm button on keyboard or controller)- Some stages have cheese hidden in hard to reach places.Cons:- Story is lacking, but is not absent.- The opening cutscene to a new game is not very good.- The game can't be minimized in windowed mode.- Configuration limited to resolution, VSync, fullscreen/windowed, and FXAA on/off. But you would likely not benefit from any more options than these on this game anyway.Not many cons, you see. Try it out."

Good combination of jump and run skill with riddles.Didn´t crash even once and couldn´t spot any bugs so far. Only thing that would be cool is an exit to windows button ingame.If you quit a game you return to the main screen, have to press enter and then you can exit to windows.No biggie, just wanted to point it out. :)"

This game has charm and excitement,  and each level is interesting and challenging. Unfortunately, its good points are horribly overshadowed by the difficulty and requirement for split-second timing. To say that this game suffers from being too finicky, is an understatement.Do not play this game unless you have either the reaction time of a fighter jet pilot, or more patience than Ghandi."

If you want to buy this game remember only like 30% of the time will be about solving puzzles.If you are looking for something that will challenge your intelligence and let you think about a brilliant solution (like I was expecting buying this game) this is not worth your time and money."

As far as puzzles go, you can freeze time and rearrange some parts of the area you are in, but it is not too hard to figure out what you need to do and when you need to do it. The platformer part, on the other hand, is frustratingly hard, and you can't make it easier by being smart with the puzzles. After the first couple of levels, I can't even get from checkpoint to checkpoint without dying a million times, which simply prevents me from enjoying this game at all.On the whole, I don't recommend the game for it's original price, especially if you'd buy it for the puzzles. If you like difficult platformers, you might like it though."
,Recommended,266330,29007540,Posted: 4 January,all,pezpimp,"Another one of those puzzle platformers where you can alter time to help you solve puzzles as you navigate a side scrolling level. I'm a big fan of these as I like platformers and puzzle games and this one was quite good although really frustrating at points. Some levels make you start from the beginning of complex sections each time you die, which can be often as you have to precisely jump between blades or dodge obstacles. The jumping levels are especially annoying as you always restart the whole level, while bosses force you to complete them in one go and you have to rewatch the cut scene over and over. When in pause mode you move blocks around and often need to place them precisely which can also be frustrating with a controller.However this is still a great game with excellent level design, some cool levels in a ship and excellent puzzles that really make you think. Well worth a purchase."
,Not Recommended,266330,17954822,"Posted: 9 September, 2015",all,Zincoshine,The producers of this game like to compare their game to super meat boy and braid...the reality is that the only resemblance this game has to braid is the ability to pause time if you have a token and solve a puzzle. the only resemblance the game has to super meat boy is the speedrun thing. This game is a platformer with puzzle elements. The graphics are great and the sound is OK but the execution is a disaster and that together with bad level design make this one game to avoid.

The time freeze thing as a mechanic is good, but I'm not sure if it really saves Ethan Meteor Hunter. The vidoes are idemonstraive of the gameplay, so if you like what you see there then get the game. If you like puzzles and platformers, then get the game.If you're on the fence, then this is basically just another puzzle platformer. Get ready to basically do the tutorial over and over."
,Not Recommended,266330,14139082,"Posted: 23 January, 2015",all,Cyril,"When I first started playing this game, I found it to be just kind of mediocre, not that bad but not anything special and not worth recommending. But the cracks really started to show after extensive play... not 100% done with the game yet but I'm annoyed enough to write a negative review right now so woo~Hmm what problem should I address first.How about the slippery edges and dropped jumps? Yeah, any edge of a platform seems to not count as part of the platform for jumping's sake, so often you'll end up not jumping when you wanted to and, presumably, dying. This doesn't feel like my fault. It feels like an error in the game engine. Dropped jumps are even more noticeable on downhill slopes, where there always seems to be a high chance of jumping not working if you aren't sliding (which you don't always want to be doing).Another major problem is the homing cannons, since, well, that's already a bad idea to begin with. Bad game. Bad, bad game. Often they're shoehorned into sections that don't need them, though, and the homing power is waaaaay way way too strong, leading to it often coming down to luck whether or not you can survive a section.There's also a lot of slooow autoscrolling sections that go on way too long, yet require a few tight, easy-to-mess-up jumps such that you can get all the way to the end of the section, screw up, and have to restart it. And some sections go on waaay too long. A lot of the levels are good about keeping decent checkpoint placement and level length but there are also plenty of exceptions.The physics also seem somewhat inconsistent, to the point where there are more than a few cases where a puzzle solution working correctly comes down mostly to luck. Not horribly inconsistent, and there aren't a lot of puzzles that have this issue; mostly any puzzles involving rolling objects.The overall pacing of the game is a bit wonky too. The higher-speed platforming doesn't mix with the puzzles well so the end result is a platformer that occasionally slows gameplay to a halt with a sliding block puzzle or a tedious autoscroll puzzle. The puzzle and platformer elements often exist in entirely separate universes, mostly. It's not a blend of the two genres, it just does them both at diferent times. There are instances of high-speed puzzle platforming that tends to be the more enjoyable parts of the game, but they're infrequent compared to the slower puzzles.The bosses (that I've seen so far) are also mostly trial and error, which is... not fun. When you know what to do, they're utterly simple and nonthreatening but when you don't they're frustrating to try and figure out; the second boss is simplified once you know his full pattern but a bit tricky until you do... and notably this boss is one of those instances of SUDDENLY PUZZLE in the middle of a platforming section.I probably shoulddn't comment that the music is bland and the character designs/general visual style is ugly, but I will, because why not.I can't find a lot to like about this game. I can be clever or interesting at times, but it does nothing to really stand out from the many better platformers available for the same price or less. Pass on this one unless you're really desperate, I'd say."
