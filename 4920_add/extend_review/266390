The reason I bought this game was because I was going through one of those ""I have hundreds of games but nothing to play"" phases on my day off. It honestly took me by surprise, and I quickly got addicted.Farm for your Life seems to have been put together by ideas from other games.-You have the farming aspect which is similar to that of Harvest moon and runic frontier. The farming is the bread and butter of the game, as you can imagine by taking a look at the title.  You have some land, you clear it, plow it, barter for seeds, sow them, water them, and occassionally sprinkle some fertilizer to keep the plants from dying.-You have your restaurant, which is really the feature that caught me. You serve dishes made with your produce at the restaurant. Instead of getting paid in game currency or something, you barter with your clients and can actually choose what you want from their inventory (which is pretty awesome when you desperately need more of a specific supply). As you expand your farm, you can upgrade your restaurant to accommodate more people and expand the range of dishes you serve. Also, to learn any dish, you must first purchase it from the peddler, go to the oven, and play fruit ninja with the ingredients. The better you do, the faster you can cook that particular dish.-You then have zombies. When night falls, zombies pop out from paths at the edge of the map and walk ever slowly towards your farm and restaurant to destroy it. Like Plants vs Zombies, you will end up using your crops to kill them by throwing it at them. You can also use items you bartered for in your restaurant to create defensive turrets like a corn cannon to cover one side of the map while you fight in the other.This all seems like a lot to do, and it is, specially when your farm and restaurant are heavily upgraded. But you recieve NPC help in exchange for shelter and a daily meal. They pop up as you expand.The story overall was decent, but not much different than endless. It could use a few more tweeks.I would give the game a 9/10. With a little more indepth story and some more content, it would be perfect."

It does get really tedious but shows lots of potential. Unfortunately I doubt the devs gonna constantly update this game. About a few hours in, you'll reach or feel like you've reached end game already.So if you're curious about this game but don't want to pay the price for it, get it on sale.Not recommending it due to the lack of content.

Zombies. Not only do you get to farm, you protect your home by attacking zombies with vegetables and can provide the locals with a restaurant.The only bad I have found so far is the flying vegetables when creating food does not always register you've clicked them, and the tutorial doesn't realize you've completed it and will have an annoying green patch glowing for a while. Otherwise, a cute quick game to play.Edit: With more hours of the game going by, I can see why many people on Big Fish find it annoying. 1. You REALLY cannot go back 1 star for meals. 2. When in the woods trying to chop wood, you will never defeat the zombie so you will always lose 1/2 the supplies you have already gathered."

But then the issues start cropping up.First off it's very buggy. The NPC's pathing is terrible and they can get stuck indefinitely making them literally useless. Often they just stand there and pick up and put down items continuously. Gathering resources from the forest is just frustrating and not fun at all; there's just too many zombies and they seem to always know where you are but you can only see them when they're close. They move slowly, but a lot of times you'll lose everything you collected in unfair ways. The controls are a bit clunkly as well.The game doesn't explain things very well. It feels random when the NPCs come by and it takes too long for them to show up as if they were just trying to pad the game knowing the actual content is very minimal. Yet despite this, it uses up more resources on your computer than you would think for a game like this.It's not exactly a bad game, though. If the problems above did not exist, it would be significantly more enjoyable."

,Recommended,266390,10521345,"Posted: 18 June, 2014",all,Fox,"Fantastic little game for what I paid for it.I completed the entire story mode in roughly 10 hours. I definitely feel like i can cut that time in half now that I know what to do and how to do it all in the game. Very little in the game is explained unfortunately, but it doesn't ruin too much of the experience as you can always google some of the answers. More than half of the achievements don't get unlocked for some reason, but who cares about that. There are some very minor detailing issues which could have been fixed but instead were overlooked, again, nothing worth complaining about though. Character customization feels a little bit weak and everything available in the customization minus hats and glasses, you see in the game on NPCs, but at least you have some customizing options which is nice. The game is much better played using the keyboard to move the map around cuz side scrolling gets irritating as the GUI prevents the scrolling. The some of the recipes training is annoyingly difficult to get 3 stars (fastest cook time) but at least once you get the stars, it's permanent unless you get even more stars, and 1 star is simple and easy to get... just take your time and get it done. The helpers do a pretty good job with the restaurant and farm, but there are still things they cannot do, like cut grass, milk the cows, make the deal with the customers, and they sometimes glitch in an annoying way where they pick up and drop something about a dozen times while they wait for more work, they also put the basket down in weird places making you have to search for them every time you want to use them. Since I muted the music cuz I tend to play for many hours at a time and music usually becomes repetitive and annoying (no idea if this one's any good though), the game ends up really lacking in sound effects... like when I throw the potion at zombies, no sound, you never hear birds and wild life in the background, etc... still not game breaking though. In this game, there is always too much to do and never enough time to do it which really keeps your mind sucked into the game trying to rush into everything and you can easily spend several hours into the game without even realizing it. The ending of the game was a little disappointing and too simplified as you basically cure the old man and he thanks you in a bubble text and the end credits appear. Also, the game froze after the end credits during loading (at 86%), probably bringing me back to game menu? Other than that, the game is very stable, plays fine on my gaming rig without having to hack the game apart in order to force it to work like some EA and Rockstar games out there...I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is into farming and time consuming games. Zombies are optional as you can disable them. Endless mode is also available if you prefer to play without an ending. I didn't play the game for the story and neither will you, but the gameplay by itself is definitely worth the money. I would suggest waiting for a sale though as I doubt those minor issues mentioned will ever be fixed and the way I see it, ""why hand a developer 100% of the money when he only delivered 90% of the game?"""
,Not Recommended,266390,10687304,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,Emily T. Awesome,"It's a pretty fun game but still rather buggy.  The zombies sometimes walk right through the fence even though there's no opening. People sometimes get stuck at the tables even after they've been served and never leave. Taking up a spot. And the part where you learn the recipes.  The food zips over a pot and you have to chop it and have it land in the pot.  It rarely does and it flies by really fast.  I love fruit ninja and I can hardly complete most of the recipes to get the food into the pot.Also you can assign workers to work in the kitchen.  They get stuck running in place.  At one point all three of them wandered off to the corner of the map and were stuck running in place against the river.  I couldn't figure out how to get them to stop.Conceptually it's really fun, if it didn't have all the dang bugs I'd recommend it. Hopefully they'll fix them."

,Not Recommended,266390,30425747,Posted: 10 March,all,UnknownDestiny,"Farm for your Life feels like a combination of several different facebook games.I was able to get a few hours out of it, but once cleared, I felt like I wasted the day and don't plan to pick it up again. There are other games on steam that do a better job than Farm for your Life.The farming aspect seems too basic with only a hand full of crops; the fighting/defence system doesn't pose any challenge after the first night (or two); and the cooking is a fruit ninja minigame, but each time the fruit(vegetables) come out in the same order, so it's more of a memory game. The only thing they did ok(ish) in is the crafting recipe’s prerequisites, requiring you to craft the basics before more complex items are unlocked.Length wise, it took me 10 hours to complete the game at a slow pace (with lots of AFK) so most people can complete this in 3-5 hours, considering the price, this game is not worth it.In my opinion, this game seems to target children and wouldn’t find any place in most people’s library. If reading other reviews has convinced you otherwise, remember, there are better farming (with fighting) games out there.(It’s my first time reviewing, so give me a break if this is done poorly, and as everyone says, this is only my opinion and may not match your opinion, look at gameplays and other reviews and consult your specialist to see if this is right for you.)"

Upgrading with materials is also a large part of the story mode and game.It's a cute game and worth a shot.It would not be on the same level of Recettear or any shop simulation game though.My only regret is that it's not too long of a game, but it's got an endless mode so it's all right.I'd rate it 7/10 probably."

Not great due to some bugs that make it fail to load so make sure you save before you talk to a quest NPC or before you go into the woods or your home. It autosaves when you learn to cook so no problem there. There was only one spelling mistake through the whole game but it obviously did not ruin the experiance.Now for the good. Great, cute graphics and its soooooo addictive! I was on my laptop for however long i said i logged and never left it except to work and sleep which was only once cos I completed it in a day! The whole just one more game day...just one more upgrade kept me going and it was great. The farming can be a tiny bit fiddly but it still rocks and the whole beating zombies with veg is kinda great. Building catapults and seeing them defend your farm is a great feeling. The resteraunt is really good and very frantic so always have a helper when you get more than one, The AI helpers are great two except when you have to feed them, its repetitive and time consuming why cant they just come over to you? Other than that I give it an 8/10 and a high reccomendation."

I would classify this game as non violent because when the zombies ""attack"" you, you just get into a slapfight and are left dizzy at the end (and depending on whether you are in the forest or not as to whether your gathered resources halve). On the farm zombies, go for your crops, not the people and are capable of destrying a farm pretty quickly if you don't fend them off. On the whole they're more annoying than they are threatening, I turned them off after a few nights because I was getting bored of throwing my vegetables at them or building resource chewing defences to throw at them. The meat of the game is in the restaraunt part of the game, you barter meals and goods for parts and seeds and feed the people, once a deal is made, they won't leave until they are fed, so you won't have to worry about them getting mad or anything.TLDR: Addictive, very shallow, pick it up cheap in a sale."

However, the game manages to combine two things i like to do the most in survival games (Minecraft, 7D2D, ...), namely: Harvest resources and take care of other survivors by providing food and shelter. The trade aspect in this game was rather surprising and the cooking minigame is fun the few times it appears. If you want a perfect playthrough you can expect about 10 hours total; A fast playthrough can easily be done in under 5 hours. Overall i was surprised that when i started this game for the first time and after a while checked the clock, several hours had passed - so i can only recommend this if you get it for under 5$ and want to hit zombies with corn cobs while feeding people in your restaurant and getting the next upgrade for your farm from that greedy merchant whilst running around to make sure your plants don't dry up. Also, your farm hands expect bed & (warm) breakfast.

However, this game I feel people should know something about before they buy it. The game has a great concept, its the integration of several casual games into one game. Its fun in the beginning but then it gets tedious fast. Balancing out produce for the restaurant and for your ammo as well keeping your hired help fed, well it's tiresome, it's not that it's hard but it's tedious (the opposite of casual). There are some AI glitches with watering cans and other items as time goes by, it would be almost easier to do it yourself if you had time to do it all on your own. The day/night cycle moves fast enough you really need to rely on your bugged/incompetent helpers to one degree or another. I think it has possibilities if the developer would fix some of the bugs as well as balance issues.  If you really want to buy this game wait till it's at least 50% off."

After that it's just a boring mess though.TL;DR:+ Character customisation is very basic and quite limited but there's a couple of interesting options to make.+ The art style for the game is interesting and it's quite well done. It doesn't interest me personally, though.+ Nice concept for a game.+ Fruit ninja style minigame is fairly fun because of the physics but it's also quite pointless.- Has quite a lot of game breaking glitches.- Expensive at full price (or anything less than a heavy discount) for the amount of content that's here.- Very repetitive and slow gameplay which has you standing around a lot doing nothing for a lot of the time.- The trading system in the game is unbalanced. Items such as seeds that you need at the start are so expensive that it takes around half an hour just to buy one seed.- The english in the game is atrocious. It's obviously not the developers' first language so it's acceptable, but hardly one sentence in the game is spelt or worded correctly.-  The single music track in the game isn't anything special and is quite repetitive.The first time I played the game, the first 20 minutes went alright, i'd finished the tutorial and I got onto the main game. Then I exited the game and came back to it, and my save file had somehow become corrupted and the game had saved me at the last section of the tutorial but some of the main characters were invisible so I couldn't actually progress.After I started the game a second time, I got onto the actual main part of the game and honestly, it's just boring.There's 3 ""sections"" to the game; Collect ingredients (apparently mostly by farming), restraunt simulator where you serve customers, and then a fruit ninja minigame.The fruit ninja game from what I could tell was alright but completely pointless and too difficult because the recipes required you to chop so many ingredients in 10 seconds which didn't even appear on time for you to chop them up, nevermind to add them into the bowl as well. You get a star rating but if you had anything more than 10 seconds (which was impossible to get anyway), you only got 1 star for the dish, and it seemed to have no impact on the dish.Unless i'm missing something, the game is ridiculously slow. There's not really any sense of direction in the game after you start serving customers in the restraunt, You ""trade"" with customers and they give you an order of what they want to eat, and then sit at the tables eternally. I had a customer sitting at the restraunt taking up space for 3 days because I had to wait for the ingredients to grow for what she wanted to eat.The controls are awkward. I don't think there's a way to actually drop items from your basket without actually using them up or adding them into your chest.  Double clicking seemed to be involved a lot and it didn't seem to always work.""combat"" is horrible. I'm not sure why it was included because it doesn't actually fit in with the game and the zombies don't even really pose as a threat. It's just annoying to have to find something to throw at the zombies when they appear, and for the first hour of the game it seemed to be only one zombie a night that would appear.There's a trading system in place which allows you to barter for items. But the items that you have to actually buy are so costly that I found myself giving away pretty much all of what I had just to be able to aquire a single seed.Also, the customers at the restraunt will ask you to cook them things that you haven't even unlocked yet, and if you accept you'll have to have them wait until you've actually unlocked it, and then wait even longer so that you actually have the ingredients to cook it.There looked to be some sort of exploration aspect to the game but I haven't gotten that far because the game hasn't actually asked me to explore for any reason yet."

No procedurally generated world, which makes replays seem all alike.A few bugs here an there, nothing major though:Customers sitting on each others' laps, dishes occasionally getting stuck and being hard to remove. Not a big deal, most of these are self-clearing when the restaurant runs out of customers during nights. Saving and re-loading the game cleared all these issues too.Mob pathfinding sometimes ignoring fences. Re-building fences ""in one go"" solved that for me though. Might also be related to mobs being ""locked out"" and thus destroying fences because they find no other way.Issues I've seen in other people's reviews that I havenotencountered:Performance issues: None for me, and I'm on an outdated Windows7 platform. Not exactly a super gaming PC, and the game runs just fine - even in later ""freeplay"" stages.Crash issues: None for me. Have played the game for about 20 hours now, and not a single crash.Bottom line:Fun game.Bought it on sale for 4€, and would do that again."

It's a bit too easy (it took me very little time to beat it - less than 10 hrs).Not bad for a short-term time waster, and it's even kind of cute, but honestly I'd recommend playing something else as the playability is short-lived and the replay value just really doesn't exist.It's kind of like Farmville meets Diner Dash; plant a crop once, harvest that square repeatedly over time to get the ingredients for your restaurant, occasionally fertilize, don't forget to buy sprinklers.  You throw crops at the zombies to make them disappear, occasionally you venture into the ""forest"" to get some needed tool, and the money you make from your restaurant gets used to buy more ""farming"" items (seeds, cows, chickens, etc).  That's pretty much all there is to it, in a nutshell."

I hope to be proven wrong in time and would give this game another shot if I saw improvement."
,Recommended,266390,30085500,Posted: 21 February,all,Apoc,"It is a fun game that get a bit repetitive but the game is short. A mix of a basic farm sim, restaurant sim and tower defense with a Fruit Ninja minigame and a simple zombie storyline. What you get in about 30 minutes of gameplay is pretty much all there is. You unlock a new crop and recipe around each 30 minutes until you finish the Story Mode in about 6 or 8 hours if you don't waste time. Then there is endless mode and a few pretty vague achievements left for about a 10 hours game so the game's price seems about right and it's a good purchase on sale.An interesting addition but also a flaw to the farm life are the helpers that you need to feed each morning and they will help you on your farm or restaurant. They are very helpful and even a little too much because you will be left with almost nothing to do as soon as you have 2. In story mode you can have 3 and an overkill 4 in endless mode while 1 alone is enough for the restaurant and it require a lot of crops for more than 1 not being enough on the farm. They also won't cut grass or milk cows and the only other thing left for you to do is to barter with the visitors to allow them to enter the restaurant and get their meal.You can and have to enter the forest to get wood and stone a few times for some upgrades but you can't attack those annoying zombies and they will make you drop your resources. Since helpers won't gather those and the few on the farm won't respawn, you are forced to navigate around those zombies and return multiple times. I'm not sure if it's totally a good or bad thing but time stop in the forest so you can't go there while your helpers work to spend some time while they do everything else.The tower defense minigame is actually optional (When starting a new game.) and it's a good thing because it's not that good and actually make you waste some of those crops in the beginning by throwing them at the zombies by hand or with towers. Zombies will steal your crops and break your fences to get there and will give you nothing in return. So they steal your stuff, towers cost some precious resources that could be spent on sprinkler instead and make you waste your hard earned vegetables. It is required for at least an achievement otherwise I would suggest always playing without them.Overall it is a good game with not that many flaws but there are also better games for all types this game try to include."

But because when I saved my game first, and loaded it, I got a blue loading screen and could only access the lower buttons. This is a known issue since 2014 (!); not resolved yet as it seems. I found a solution via google, this time I could load my game but half of my things were missing. I thought it was a one time-thing and started another game. I was cleverer this time: played for five minutes, saved, quit the game, reloaded - worked fine. I did this four or five times during my next two hours of farming and saved in different slots just to be sure. Then I quit the game, shut down my computer, went to sleep and today loaded the game again. AND: ALL SAVEGAMES ARE GONE but the first one from when I had only played five minutes. This is ridiculous. I tried to get a refund, but know what?! I can't, because I have played more than two hours. HOW ON EARTH should I have known savegames are only saved by... pure luck?

Good for people who want a chill game as well since they can enable peaceful mode and avoid zombies attacking your farm entirely (with the exception of having to go to the forest to get materials).

Then 2 more.It combines Fruit Ninja, Cooking mama, Don't starve and farm sim all together.  It blends nicely with all of themHowever, there is some things that need to be changed.....1) Wood. People that come to eat your food should have wood as one of the things in their inventory. If you are able to feed them, you shouldn't have to risk your life in the woods to get 3 wood and run before zombies eat your face.2) EVERYTHING should be worth something. You start out with a watering can. You can't sell it, even after you upgrade it to the red one (Holds twice as much water). So you are stuck with it or give it away.3) Coins should be common. Common currency. I can see scrap metal being some sort of currency, but why have the player start out with some for story, then it never to be seen again?4) You should be able to attack zombies in the woods. You have an axe, sythe, shovel and hammer! But yet you get into slap fights that end up with half the things you gathered on the floor.5) There should be one or two more available spots for helpers. 3 is great, but eventually you need a lot more help on the farm and resturant...6) Helpers should be able to go into the woods and get wood. Would help out with #17) It would be nice to be able to destroy a fully grown plant to get the seeds back but no yeild. That way you can rebuild after learning new things, but instead you lose it all...All together, its a fun little game. Best to get it on sale.7/10."

You start out the game with a handful of seeds and tools and start farming away, periodically defending from zombies and serving food from your farm to refugees in exchange for resources. Over time you can unlock better recipes, crops, and farm equipment.The concept of the game is actually cool, but it's pretty clearly designed for mobile and the controls suck on a PC. For instance, the cooking mini game is basically fruit ninja, which you have to play with a mouse. Farm / restaurant management is all micro (go here, pick vegetable, put in box, repeat until all plants are harvested) which gets to be a tad tedious.This game has some charm, but it's a miss as a PC title."

It's a lot of fun, and strangely compelling despite its bugs and lack of storyline (the storyline mode is at best a thin sprinkling of plot and really isn't much different to endless mode). The bad news is that, for what basically amounts to a casual sim game with unlockables, the game is woefully short. The story mode is at best 10 hours of play. Endless mode isn't much better, and whilst you can theoretically go on forever, you'll find that you have everything unlocked and nothing to do but hoard very quickly. The achievements are also bugged - several are impossible to get due to not being awarded despite completion in-game (such as the golden scythe). The audio is also irritatingly bugged if your character commits actions (such as chopping wood) off screen, and the A.I. helpers leave something to be desired. I recommend trying this game if you manage to pick it up in a sale, but be forewarned that there's only about 10-20 hours of gameplay in it before there's nothing left to do, and the game has a lot of bugs."

The game is fun in its core concept but it is SOOO buggy.  I can\'t quit out without having to ctrl-alt-delt.  There is constant issues with zombies running past your fences and completly ignoring defenses.  a lot of the achievements are very unclear or completly bugged out.  The game was fun and the only way id recommend it is get it on sale like i did otherwise it\'s not even worth its $10 price tag.It was fun for a few hours and could have been a really awesome game if the developers had actually fixed its bugginess. 7/10 gameplay4/10 overall because of all the bugs"

It does tend to crash quite a bit and has a couple of odd features, such as the cooking system and characters standing so their faces are merged. Overall, its not a bad game, just would probably be better suited to an Iphone with a touch screen."

However, the zombies are complete pushovers. With the undead posing no threat, Farm for your Life ends up being just another farming sim, and games like Stardew Valley and World's Dawn make much better alternatives."

Although only get this game on sale I got about 2-3 hours on the Story Time, and going to be playing this game from time-to-time.  So overall very fun short game but had a blast with it :)"

It's fast paced during the nighttime, but relaxing and repetitive during the day to balance you out. Also then it has strategy management, so taxes your skills evenly!Cute story, good length, nice visually, fun ideas - well worth it!The only thing I was diasppointed at was the complexity and depth of the world outside :( it could have been more complex!"

It is definitely worth $10.Cons:It seems incomplete, and unfinished.Needs more time, and love to grow into the beautiful game it could be.This is more like an Alpha, or Beta version.Recommendation to Author:Keep working on this game and growing it. Make more challenges and expand!"
