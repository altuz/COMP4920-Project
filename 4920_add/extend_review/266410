,Recommended,266410,14116324,"Posted: 22 January, 2015",all,Fiatsu,"Motorsport isn't for everyone, when i was younger i only liked fast cars because i thought they were sexy.Now after years of watching various Motorsport series' and Sim Racing along the way my perspective has changed.iRacing requires a change of perspective, you cannot come in as a fan of race cars and expect excitment.You have to be a fan- no, a follower of Motorsport. Someone who holds that passion at heart for Great racing.The more you love Motorsport the better iRacing will fit into your life and becomes a Hobby that trandsend general gaming in terms of long term enjoyment.In the beginning for me the buisness model was very odd, after buying stuff like rFactor, Race07-Evo etc then playing those over time it was the weirdest thing to pop up and i was one of the decenters. ""WTF is this- etc""Then after a few months things became shockingly clear, rFactor, Race07 etc weren't updated.... iRacing was.Simply as that my mind changed as i realized they were in it for the long haul, every season iRacers get an update, Big or small it either adds content after months of development or more functionality with tweaks etc.Every $ i've spent in iRacing has been worth it, over the years we got pieces of content bit by bit and with so much more to come the list is getting bigger. To look at iRacing now with fresh eyes the money added up must be daunting, for me i waited impatiently for months and years in some cases for a Track/ Car to the point that the $12 i payed for them over the course of months was nothing. Anyway.iRacing at its core is a Motorsport Simulator, so excitment comes in spikes just like watching F1 these days.The first few laps are crazy and exciting then things settle down a bit with some sparatic fighting with a decent climax at the end.When you are the one in the car this dynamic is the same but there is an added challenge, getting er done.You're responsable for the outcome of your race, if you make a mistake you suffer the consiquences, if you're slow it's up to you to learn more and improve.Everything is up to and on you.As a result overall it's a fantastic challenge, to start from the very bottom and make your way up that ladder, from fighting scrubs to meeting people on your level then above. Over time iRacing becomes less and less of a gaming dynamic and more of a forum for personal improvement.Either way in the end as a fan of motorsport, facing the same challenge as the drivers i watch on track has added a fantastic dynamic to my life. To watch F1 then run a race with 35 people from all over the world at the very top is superb.Challenging, Exciting and Fulfilling."

I'm going to break it down.Fun: YES! The level of courtesy and professionalism of drivers in this community is unparalelled.  It makes for very fun, competitive, and thrilling racing.  Even in the Rookie leagues, the number of drivers that care about the safety rating system is absolutely untouchable by any internet racing community.  AC is good, but not this good.Inexpensive: ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Talk about a money pit.  It's not only a monthly/yearly subscription, it's also a LITERAL F*CKTON OF DLC.  Once you have ascended from the Rookie ranks in this game, the cost increases dramatically.   As of yesterday, the total for all content in Rookie Class and Class D is $580.61 (including a $193.54 multi-purchase discount).  Class A, B, and C continue to add to the DLC money pit, but I'm going to skip the calculation.    Granted, there are a few cars and a few tracks that come with the subscription.  However, the price of each track or car is between $12 and $15.  For instance, the 2007 version of Daytona Intl Speedway is included with subscription, but the 2011(?) version is not. Nurbergring Nordschleife and the Grand Prix Strecke are separate $15 purchases.  But remember, it's only $99.99/yr, which is more than some racing sims without subscription fees and all DLC combined.  For that amount of money, they better have something better than the terribly clunky and slow web UI they currently implement (Read: it launches sessions from a website and it's terrible sometimes).  The fact it's based on a game from 2003, which has been continuously modified, doesn't justify the cost of building models and the level of physics/particles. Also, if you want to race against your friends - for fun - you need to rent server time from them, or just hope you get matched in the same race.  Absolutely no fun for those who want to race with friends.Easy:  No.  Just no.  Winning is not easy.  Driving is not easy.  Proper car setup (not done in Rookie class) is not easy.  The tracks and drivers are challenging.  VERY challenging.  With that challenge comes reward, if you do well.Race fan, Sim racer, and Gamer alike:  I don't recommend playing this game with anything but a proper racing wheel.  Not for the gamer who just wants to create spectacular crashes.  This game is for the serious racers and the community reflects that.  If you're into just watching, they have a youtube channel that broadcasts the races, and they could really use some of those sale profits to increase production quality there.  It sounds like 12-15 y/o kids trying to sound like overly professional and dry race announcers - except one is in the studio and the other is voice chatting over skype.  You watch the races from the same cameras and jerkyness that comes from the instant replay cameras that you get in game (like a single person is just operating it to watch the race).  They desparately need someone who has worked in broadcast to help ramp up the production value.  Words cannot describe how terribly boring and unprofessional these really are.Overall:  2/5.  The community and safety rating system are the only things holding this game together, imho.  Besides them just now (March 2016) updating to DX11, the cost of DLC, terrible web interface/sever load, being based on a game from 2003, bad broadcast production quality, inablity to race with friends, and subscription costs are enough for me to hate the game.  I got a yearly subscription on sale for $30-something, will not buy any DLC due to cost, and own a racing wheel.  The only reason I ever come back is to race with people who aren't starting wrecks like bored children.Edit: Added costs. Emphasized sh*tty server load/webUI. Added comments on (not) playing with friends.  Lowered overall score.  I also recently purchased an HTC Vive - it seems that iRacing has completely removed their VR support (even oculus), so that is yet another deal breaker for me.  Technically no racing sim supports the Vive, but that's not to say I don't have some of them working.Edit 2: They've finally re-enabled VR support...  For Oculus.  There are many trying to get it work on the Vive with ReVive injector, to no avail.  For those wondering: Assetto Corsa (with ReVive), Live for Speed (native), and Project Cars (native) are all working with the Vive at this point.  All are much cheaper ways to race.Edit 3: (late) Now with Vive support.  Looks great, is very optimized, and is even fun.  Still, after forgetting to cancel my subscription, I'm currently trying to justify the $99 I just spent -- I just can't."

Thats not to say there arent some issues, as there are, like a dated graphics engine, in game purchases for expanding tracks and drivable vehicles as well as having a limited pool of cars to drive. But all in all, an excellent Simulation that doesn't pretend to be anything its not. You just have to give it some time and love and it will give back.50 hours in: Had a number of issues purchasing iRacing content through Steam. iRacing support very helpful. Steam support completely lackluster. Been running the Global Challenge series in the Cadillac. Looking at working back through the Skip Barber series and on up to the Star Mazda series. Also, to get the most from this game, you ""have"" to use a steering wheel and pedals. Controllers just dont cut it!Original review included for posterity, ""Pretty average game.

I believe that the monthly subscription cost is overpriced... Not only that,  then you have to pay for subsequent cars and tracks as well which for me kills it stone dead. Buy this sim only if you've got money to burn. There are plenty of other sims out there, all with equally decent aspects that don't rip you off, so go for one of those instead."

The sim is well done and plays well, but it is very expensive to play, involving and initial software purchase, monthly membership and exessive expensive in-game purchases, if you wish to advance beyond the initial cars and tracks included in the membership.  Completing a series race will cost you for several $14.95 add on tracks in order to compete.  This would all be fine except that after they take your money, they don't police the drivers, and apparently, they have allowed the local zoo to experiment with letting chimpanzees drive at least one car every race.   When an out of control driver doing donuts during the pace lap hits you, you are penalized.  I spent WAY too much on this game before I discovered it nearly unplayable up to class B due to driver incompetence."
,Recommended,266410,31478937,Posted: 30 April,all,RodRacing,"This is the real deal when it comes to sim racing. Yes it has a subscription fee and the cars and tracks all add up to an expensive package. But if you play your cards right and level yourself through the licences the way they want you to (nice and slowly so you learn your race craft at a lower level with slower cars) you will eventually start earning iRacing credits which allow you to buy tracks and cars just by participating in official races in every official race week.So basically it pays itself back after an initial investment into the game. Once you clear the Rookie licence and head into the D, C, B A and eventually PRO/WC licence classes, that's where the real competition begins. The racing is always extremely competitive, although accidents do happen, which is inevitable, we're humans after all! Just have to drive defensively and have lightning reflexes, trust me I'm a pro at dodging people and get myself stuck in a tyre barrier :)So overall, if you're serious about sim racing and have a wheel setup, give this a try, you will not be disappointed, even if you dont want to splash the cash on a lot of cars and tracks."

Profesional drivers use iRacing, to LEARN a race track that they may have never been to in real life yet, weeks in advance of traveling there in real life! Dale Earnhardt Jr. is one of those professional Drivers who has Attested to having done exactly that! iRacing is so accurate to real life, that the same Cracks, Bumps and Grooves that are in the pavement that you can see on T.V.  and see in the famous Indianapolis Raceway, Are there in iRacing IN EXACT DETAIL down to the MILIMETER! They use Laser Scanning to make an IDENTICAL COPY of the real track! So tracks that maybe have small Banking on a 90 degree turn in real life, you might race that same track in Forza or Asseto Corsa, and be forced to take that turn WAY SLOWER than in real life thus negatively affecting your lap times, and you cannot compare your lap times in whatever car you just drove on that track to the professionals who drive that track in that identical car in real life!  Whereas with iRacing you can take a lap time at say Daytona Speedway in an Actual GEN-6 NASCAR RaceCar or Indy Car, and then Compare it to ANY Real Nascar or INDY driver's REAL Qualifying TIME on that track in that same car in real life to see how you stack up! NO OTHER RACING GAME HERE ON STEAM CAN MAKE THAT CLAIM and truely back it up, time after time...on track after track!So i say again, Dont go thinking this is a ""GAME"" because this.... if anything, is a way for you to develop real life skills that you could take into a real life race car and start a racing career with. (if you dont believe it, look up iRacings World champions, Many of them have done exactly that, and used iRacing as a launchng point for their real life racing career's!So basically, if you like Arcade style racing games but dont like watching competitive MotorSports in real life, Wishing you could be the guy or girl driving that car at 200 plus miles an hour,.....Then iRacing may not be for you. And the reason i say this is, in iRacing there is no Rewinding time if you hit a wall or something, theres no buying PARTS UPGRADES, theres no cheat codes or ""TURBO BOOST BUTTON"", And if you dont have a steering wheel and aren't prepared to race the way a REAL driver would race, then you will seriously be having a hard time with it when you rise out of your Rookie License's in both Road and Oval Racing! (Although every once in a while people on X-Box controlers can do QUITE decently, BUT, it takes A LOT LONGER to get good at mastering an X-box's Joystick to get through a particular turn's ""Apex"" without missing a beat, And to be comepletely honest here....Most of the people i've talked to who started out on X-Box Controllers like that, IMMEDIATELY went and bought a steering wheel and pedals!Which despite being a bit of an Investment, you need to remember you're investing in Real Life skills you can use Every day to drive safer, OR Even take these skills into a real Race car in real life! So is that worth a few hundred dollars?...You BET IT IS!)One thing i learned EARLY ON in my still very young iRacing Career, which was something SO OBVIOUS, i completely ""FACEPALMED"" myself once i truely REALIZED that i was so Naive' to believe it!....And this was how i've been SubConciously TRAINED over the years without realizing it, that all these Movies and ""arcade style"" racing games make you think that you can just FLOOR the gas pedal through a wreck, and things like touching a wall with the front fender does no damage to the car, or, driving alongside another car and you bump his Left Rear Fender, and nothing happens whereas in real life the wreck that you would cause Could be catastrophic to ALL cars involved!, And in those games and movies you catch the competition pretty fast if you fall behind because they have ""catch up speed"" toggle-able! Or if theres a wreck up ahead you can just Floor the gas pedal and push the other cars out of your way!....And in iracing NONE OF THAT IS TRUE! This is REAL DEAL, REAL LIFE RACING AGAINST REAL DRIVERS (Some of whom Race on weekends at their Local Track in Real life, and have Years of Training over your skills!) And you must Drive as competitively as you can WITHOUT  making contact with other cars & walls as best you can! Touch a wall and spin out and cause  damage to your car? If that happens you can't just expect to pull a manuever like when playing  ""NEED FOR SPEED"" and pull back out, onto the track and race right back up to first place!Your damage has REAL AFFECTS on your engine performance, Wheel alignment, and Aerodynamics! If all of that car isn't in pristine condition, you are SEVERELY HINDERING yourself! And in most cases a pit-in or Towing all the way back into the pits is necessary, and just be prepared that in ""ROOKIES"" you will see it happen multiple times per race where someone will spin, cause a wreck with another car, and then get back and keep going, not realizing that the now damaged car they are driving is slower and now a danger to others as they try to pass that damaged car at high speed!Now as for Pricing: There are those who complain about the price, but the prices they charge AREN'T to line their pockets with money like these $60 dollar a game, Arcade Style Racing games! When iracing Charges you THE MINIMUM PRICE THAT THEY CAN, Give you A BUNCH OF FREE CONTENT WITH YOUR FIRST PURCHASE of the service, And EVEN Allow your Races to contribute to your ""Store Credit""!! They do all of that, Just so after you pay about $40. Dollars to get started with iRacing, you have pretty much all the tracks and Cars you need to compete for a few months without having to pay anything else! But when iRacing charges me. $11.95 for a car that i want to race that season $14.95 for a track, i HAPPILY pay that because iRacing is setup to charge each driver the MINIMUM it can in order for our purchases of those cars and tracks to fund the development of FUTURE TRACKS AND CARS!So imagine Like me you live on a Disability income and since like me you live near Laguna Seca (Or whatever Real life track near you, that you wished you could've Competed at!), you've wished your whole life you could get into Racing Profesionally, But Like me, Despite your parents WANTING to get you into the sport, couldn't afford it for you when you were young...Now picture for Roughly $40 bucks and the Price of a Decent Steering wheel and pedal setup, i can take a Porsche out on that track and finally LIVE THAT DREAM! And finally, for MUCH CHEAPER than it costs to drive a REAL RaceCar, i can Learn, and study from Professional Drivers! I can even Race AGAINST REAL PRO's IF  I KEEP practicing and get good enough! About a year ago a 17yr old Kid who won the Iracing Championship NASCAR series is now Announced plans to get into racing in Real life! And he's only been Racing in iRacing for 5 or 6 years! And it shows that this isnt some ""GAME"" to go play to unwind, This is a severely competitive Adrenaline rush inducing Simulation of the REAL THING!In Closing, the rule of thumb you can apply to both real life racing and iRacing is that much like Real life Racing the Competitive level is REAL! NO OTHER RACING GAME OR ANY VIDEO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED, has EVER truely given me ""BUTTERFLIES"" just from the level of sheer excitement you get in a rolling start before that green flag drops!  Especially since you are being given the  opportunity to drive against people who are just as fast, or if not faster than you are!No other Racing Game or Even Regular Computer Game has EVER been able to TRUELY provide that ""BUTTERFLIES IN THE STOMACH"" Feeling to drivers and gamers alike! Not in the way that iRacing does! And i can attest to it, having nearly 200 steam Games, that Despite it being a bold statement it is 100% TRUE!"

76561197976030327,Recommended,266410,17420456,"Posted: 6 August, 2015",all,Flag1944,"This is one of the best sims available. Decent graphics, great FFB, great physics, laser scanned tracks, amazing multiplayer (nothing comes close to the online experience).I played this title for a while on and off steam, and while I was active it was great. Problem is you need to have plenty of free time (which sadly I no longer have) in order to justify the cost of playing this title. If you have the time for hardcore play then this title is more than worth it. If you are the casual player and cannot adhear to scheduling beyond your control then I would recommend checking it out for a month or two to see how it blends with your real life schedule.I have nothing negative to say about this title. As many reviewers complain about the costs - it really is not any more expensive than you want it to be. You are not forced to join season championships. But if you are inclined to join such events then you must buy the cars and tracks in order to compete. But in the long run after you bought those you own them even after the events are over.  The quality of these products are of the highest calliber and are quite cheap for what you are getting.Whether you are the hardcore or casual sim racer I recommend you at least try Iracing - as it is a sim experience like no other."

,Recommended,266410,16846307,"Posted: 2 July, 2015",all,Aceu,"I've given iRacing some time over the past 4 months of my subscription. It's finally time I give it a solid review. First things first, iRacing is NOT your average pick-up-and-play racing game. If you think this you are WRONG. It's a racing simulator, so you need to have the proper equipment.Essentials for iRacing:USB Steering Wheel and Pedals (Usually bundled together)Working HeadsetShifter (Unless your Wheel comes with Paddle or Gear Shifters)A comfortable stationary chair. (There are a lot of races where you are going to be sitting for a while)It's possible to see some iRacers on youtube telling you that you need something ludicrous like a triple-screen monitor, or a Force FeedBack Racing Chair system. You Don't. All you need is mentioned above and you'll be ready to race in no time.So, now comes the gameplay. How does it fair to the rest?Racing is very enjoyable in iRacing. The Staff at iRacing really worked hard on making the best and most realistic simulator out there. For example, since iRacing laser scans each track, you'll be able to feel every bump and groove from the actual track. Each car has it's own driving style and you really do have to practice if you want to win races... I know that I've clocked at least 5 hours into this game just practicing Cornering and Turn exiting.How's the variety of cars?There are plenty of cars for each road and oval courses. Road courses do have more of a selection, but I am very content with Oval's selection. I have raced in both Road and Ovals and the cars relatively drive smoothly. I do tend to lean more towards the Ovals however, coming from a NR2003 Season Background. In total, there is a good enough selection of cars to choose from.Which leads me to my final topic, Price.How expensive will iRacing get?In short, VERY Expensive. Cars cost $11.95 for a one-time fee. Tracks range from $11.95 to $14.95, also one-time fee.If you want everything in the game, (Tracks and Cars (Road and Oval)) This will easily cost somewhere in the thousands for the game alone. But don't be alarmed. iRacing gives you a starter pack with around 5-6 cars. and 10 tracks (Don't Quote me on that but I'm pretty sure those are the numbers.) to start with for your Rookie/D-class stages. You don't have to buy everything in one series to play in that series. For example, Let's say you can buy 1 of the 3 different cars, and 1 track. Whenever the schedule changes to that track, you can then race in that series without buying the whole series itself.Conclusion/TL;DRiRacing is an excellent simulator experience. If you want to race side-by-side against other racers, this is absolutely the game for you. Just keep in mind of the price tag. Be ready to throw down some serious cash if you want to be racing continously in the later stages."

Most the of community is fair and friendly...if you stay away from oval racing... :-)I would highly reccomend to any sim racers out there. I do have some issues with the game, after playing a few more simulator games, I tend to find that the handeling on this game is out dated. Another issue I have is the inability to create a party with a friend and to join a sheduled race with them."

Now i have your attention......This is easily my favorite racing Simulator by far. i've played around with all the latest road racing titles, but nothing compares to its driving physics or the feel of the tracks. I am in awe at the skill and racecraft shown by the majority of the iRacing members. The Community is awesome. Active members can view the exclusive forums flooded with everything SIM you could ask about.This is Not a game so much. If you would rather a plethora of concept cars or fanatasy tracks, occasionally playing on weekends, maybe this is not for you.Pros-In my opinion second to none.-Supremely Realistic physics.-Strong accurate Force feedback.-Great PC apps available -iSpeed/trading paints for e.g.-Exciting youtube channel featuring live professional races with commentry. It's more exiting than most real world races-Ghost mode during an official  race. See how fast/slow you go with out getting in the way.-Can drive extremely drunk / don't need seatbelt.-License system encourages safety to progress. Regularly bans trolls or people basically crashing into everyone.-V8 Holden Commodore  + Mount Panorama. (Huge Pro if your Aussie).Cons-No Nudity or A.I.-Time Sink. You'll need to practice to be competitive. Your GF may get a tad lonely. Your dog will miss a walk or two.-Get a basic set of cars and tracks. You're eventually forced into buying more content just to be eligable to enter races.-You may be tempted to try out your new found sim skills in your car.(Hope your insured).-Don't expect to race immediately. You may/should spend a week mucking around with settings and finding your feet.-Some 12 year old drivers will beat you... with ease.-No Wheel ......no deal. Xbox 360 controller won't cut it. If it does than this is definately not the game for you.-Requires a subscription and internet connection to use (Just like my GF)"

The multiplayer system works by having a few different factors, you have your iRating which is a scoring system you can build up (or down) depending on where you come in races, bluntly explained as ""How good you are"", this will match you against the closet drivers who share a similar iRating, the second system is your Licence, this is dependent on how clean you race, the cleaner you are (not hitting other people, keeping between the white lines and not going off-track) the higher you will progress towards your next licence, you start off with a rookie licence then D, C, B, then A, as you progress your licence you will get access to newer racing series such as Formula Renault, Blancpain GT Series, IMSA and so on.Now some negatives, the force feedback and the physics aren't quite as good as rFactor 2 or Assetto corsa, it is much more difficult to feel the limits of the car in iRacing but quite easy in both AC and rF2, also the engine is based off an old Nascar game from 2003 so physics aren't 100% totally up to par and neither are the graphics.Now lets move on to the bigger con, its stupidly expensive, first of all you have to pay monthly for a subscription which is $13, this price can be lowered depending on whether you buy a months subscription of 12 months, the per monthly cost will go down to $9 and on top of that you'll have to buy the cars which are about $13 each and then on top of that you'll have to buy tracks which cost $15 each. Its expensive for what you are getting, from getting a few tracks or cars you could be getting and full on new Triple A game or Assetto Corsa with all of its content. But, if you are a racing simulation fan it is a must buy, even if you only try it for a month.If you got this far use coupon code PR-GRIPTV for 3 months and the Ford GT for $13."

While it was definitely a quality product and fun, and certainly unique I wouldnt say the prices justify the content. Fair would be removing one of the pay walls i.e. just paying for cars and tracks or just paying subscription and receiving all content. Good for rich people. Wouldn't recomend for people who dont have a lot of money to spend. If you're on a tight budget I would recomend looking into assetto corsa or rfactor 2 or even rfactor 1 for that matter. Anyway onto the review.Iracing requires an internet connection to be used, despite the files being on your hard disk. This is because there are no AI. All races with other vehicles are online with real players meaning you need a good and constant internet connection to properly enjoy the title. Unfortunately there are otherpeople with sub optimal internet connections who decide to race anyways and when you lag in this sim your car disapears to all other drivers but it maintains its physical presence there (essentialy becoming invisible), which tend to lead to crashes since other drivers are no longer aware of the vehicles position which is very unfortunate for anyone that makes contact with the vehicle and/or wrecks which leads me to my next point.In order to keep the trolls and♥♥♥♥♥♥drivers racing with other♥♥♥♥♥♥drivers, the sim uses a ranking system based on 2 factors (safety rating, and irating). The SR or safety rating is a scale of how well you can keep from getting into incidents. For the sake of convenience from this point on I shall be refereing to safety rating as SR. Incidents include going off track, making contact with other vehicles, making contact with any walls, and loosing control (spining out). Each incident varies depending on the incident or magnitude if applicable. Per race you have a maximum of 17 incidents before you are disqualified. Incidents vary from 0 being the lowest to 4 being the highest. At the end of the race depending on how many incidents you got your SR will change acordingly. The sim has a license system that ranges as follows: rookie, D, C, B, and A. The license you have will determine what races you can enter, i.e having a higher license means you can enter higher profile events. Besides the license types there are two license classes. These are: oval, and circuit. You begin with both at 2.5 SR in rookie license. Practice does not affect your SR however time trial events, Qualifying, and Races affect it to different extents. Racing has the highest impact then time trials and qualifying are about the same. After each race your SR changes either to a higher or lower value, depending on the amount of incidents you got will determine how much it will change. To progress to a higher license you need to fullfil certain listed requirements. Such requirements can be found on your profile page and consist of a minimum SR to be attained and a minimum performance requirement (races that must be entered) that must be completed to get promoted. You will be promoted at the end of each season however you may be promoted before then if you complete the fast track requirements which is usualy a hightened SR requirement (usually 4.0 as opposed to the normal 3.0 requirement). MPR is a minimum amount of events in a certain category of competition you must enter in in order to fullfil the requirement i.e  2 races or 4 time trials. It must be noted however that all events with the exception of practice sessions count towards SR but not MPR. After you get promoted past your rookie license to D class only certain events will count towards your MPR, unfortunately, this is where it gets expensive almost all events that count towards your MPR after rookie either require a paid track and/or a paid car. You will then need to purchase a car from an event series that counts towards your MPR to fullfil it. Irating is a numerical measurement similar to SR except it measures how fast you are as a driver. 7000 for example is a very high irating while 1000 is a rookie level irating. Event races are divided into splits. The split you will be put in is determined by your irating. A higher rating gets you into a higher split with faster drivers in order to maintain racing competitive and enjoyable.Now onto the racing. You have different race categories for different license classes as mentioned above. Higher licenses gets you into higher profile races with usualy faster, better performing vehicles. It should be noted most vehicles in the higher profile races have to be purchased in order to compete in said races, along with the tracks. Vehicles tend to be $11.99 USD and tracks vary from $4.99 USD to $14.99 USD. In order to purchase all vehicles and tracks you would need to spend upwards of $800 USD. Now if you want to do that its your choise. Anyways back on topic, as mentioned each category of racing has set cars that can be used i.e mazda mx5 cup only uses the miata, meanwhile in group a oval uses sprint cars only. Tracks are cycled aproximately every week and there is a set schedule that is easily accesible to the end user at any time to know what track the series will be using in the upcoming weeks and or months. Races ocur in intervals varying from 1 hour to 6 hours depending on the series, and some extremely high profile series only happen on certain dates during the year and can only be entered by select individuals deemed worthy, such as the sprint cup peak antifreze series. This series is the equivalent of the nextel cup for iracing and only the top oval racers can enter.Now would i recomend sim the is a very good question. Quality and content wise its by far one of the best around and the system for racing they have implemented is certainly one of a kind however I can't bring myself to recomend it to anyone who isnt raking in half a million a year as the money you would need to spend to get to the top is a waste of it. That is not to say the sim isn't well made as each car and track require weeks of practice to get reasonably competitive with and much more to master however from a financial standpoint its certainly not worth spending all the money as you would be better off buying a car and taking it to track days, and that is this titles achilies heel. I hope whoever reads this can now make an informed decision or purchase. If you have any questions feel free to comment on my review."
