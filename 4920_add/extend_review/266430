Then the game has glitches in the menus, and a 25 minute download. I wasn't even able to get to the space. Menus, menus, menus. Long startup. BEFORE I EVEN GOT IN."

,Recommended,266430,29893657,Posted: 12 February,all,Barney Rubble,"Of the three hours I played the game, I did enjoy it.I personally enjoy lore and reading about backstory/origins and this game has a fair amount of it, so I'd highly suggest buying this if you enjoy a mix of story and survival.It is still early access at this moment so there is a few bugs, I can name one off the top of my head being that text will sometimes overlap in places however this doesn't impact on reading to much as the pieces of backstory you can find are saved to a section in the main menu to what you've unlocked. If I had one complaint it would be that there is not enough lights in some places. Such as bedrooms,basements,attics,closets as well as there not being time to react to a monster. If I had to score it gets 5 out of a complete 4. it's good pick a copy up for your pal and synch into the coop! Tons of hours of repeatability with it."

I guess, I could grind through the forums to get help and updated visuals, but the program crashes so often, I couldn't even decide that the bare concept even interests me or not. Thank god, it's free, so it's a painless pass."

,Recommended,266430,30044525,Posted: 19 February,all,Deskilln,This is a game which you can watch videos and play games and I wish you could play anarchy arcade. Everyone should try it. You can't go wrong with a free game.

I love the actual game. But this one fact (And how hard it is to get emulators to work ingame >.<) kinda ruins it. If they changed this one thing, I'd be pretty damned happy with this game!"

,Recommended,266430,30010911,Posted: 18 February,all,Press J Productions,"It's ok. It's kinda fun but it has some problems.Eg: Random floating heads.I also think that, if the game had some pre-build assets like chairs and tables to put in your arcade, it would be better (instead of exploring the workshop to try and find the things you need).Consequently, the game is a really good way to store your Steam games even if you can only get items from the workshop and your library.It's really fun to make rooms specifically for your games. I made a Fallout room for Fallout 4 and had posters on the wall ext. It's really cool how you can do things like this."
