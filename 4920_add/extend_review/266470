I have found playing just a short while that I can see some potential in this game. Being in an Australian timezone I feel it will be a long time before I can play online with the dedicated servers due to ping and player numbers, so I am restricted to Single player. However the beauty of this game is if I can get enough friends interested, I can run my own dedicated server.The fact this game even has that mode is GREAT, it adds much more variety & options then the drudgery that is playing MWO, or Hawken.""SO FAR"" the devs are showing interest in the community feedback so far which is great, if they can keep that up, that will help them a long way.The graphics aren't phenomal, though respectable, the gameplay mechanics work, though do need a lot of work, and the devs are stated that is part of their plan which is good. The overall Vision the developers have for this game is very good, its just a matter of whether they are able to get there.If you just consider this a Speccie stock purchase, and play a bit now and then and provide feedback it will hopefully help the Devs get this game to where they want."

But i reject MWO because there is no singleplayer game.After many searched, i decided to buy this game.I really hope the developer put more effort into it.The price is should be worth more than what is the content now.There are few thing i suggest to be ready first:-Optimise graphic setting, really lagging during full screen-Simple tutorial for battle controling.-Texture improvement-Sound improvementI recommend buying if you're fan of MechWarrior.

However I was only there for the mechs, and the game did have a few mechs for you to play with.  Basically there's 4 default mechs that fall into the light to heavy catergories, then you have the option to build your own mech.  Now I know at this point you're probably drooling, but the options are limited.  Basically you pick a chasis, and you;ll be using the same chasis as one of the defualts, so there isn't a lot of variety there.  4 chasis, which you can customize the paint, camo, stickers, and logos on, then you get to add some weapons to your mech's hardpoints.  Each chasis has its own base armor rating as well as speed, and point level.  So everything you add onto your mech costs points, and adding extra armor will take points and reduce your overall speed.Weapon types are very vanilla, gatling guns, lasers, rockets, flamethrowers, nothing out of the ordinary or jaw dropping for that matter.  However you can still customize quite a bit, trying to create that perfect battle mech.  I go with low overload weapons, usually gatling guns, gatling lazers, and maybe a rocket pod so I can spam my opponet.  Most players I saw were using the railguns and after a few shots would overload their weapons then stand around like an idiot while they waited for their weapons to cool down.Your mech has several hit locations on them, each with its own raiting.  So your opponent, or you, can prioritize certain parts.  For me and my mech Tiny Savage, I circle my opponet and target the legs, once the legs go you'll have a hard time being able to turn effectively, then I just keep running circles and blast away.  Or you could knock out a certain weapon system, or just shoot at whatever part of the mech you feel like.  Just note that once your cockpits health gets low, you'll start to seem some distortion going on, and you'll have a hard time seeing things.  If this happens, or your mech has taken a beating, just find your nearest repair center which will have combat ready in no time.I will say that the AI is dumb, like dumb as a bag of rocks.  Often times they will just run to a location and stand there the entire game.  Other times they'll take a certain amount of damage and immediately stop fighting and run back to their base to try and repair themselves.  Matches can take a while to complete, especially attrition, because somehow those ticket counters never seem to go down fast enough.Overall I would suggest that you check this game out, especially if you're a fan of mechanized combat, but I'd wait and see if this thing goes on sale, because the $19.99/$14.99 I spent was a bit much for an early access game that doesn't have a whole lot of content in it. All things considered though, its a good game, and its fun, I put 76 minutes into without even realizing it. So 7/10 mostly for the lack of mech types available, and the terrible AI, however I expect all of that to be fixed once this game launches fully."

It's a great alternative to MWO, minus the grind. Granted, the game is still buggy, and not many people play it, so the multiplayer section is kinda bleak, but the game has amazing potential. The graphics are a lot better than MWO, and the gameplay is a lot smoother, IMO of course. I highly recommend this game if you want a smaller alternative to MWO, but you have to remember, this game is still in early access, so it's not going to be AAA quality. Yet. The developers are constantly communicating with the customers, and are extremely helpful. So, if you want a Mechwarrior style game, but also want awesome developer help that actually LISTENS to it's customers, this is the game for you!"

No tutorial that I could find, and although there is a bot option in Instant Action, other players do join pretty quick.  I guess just check the key bindings and figure it out.  It's not too bad of a learning curve.The game plays pretty good.  The lightmechs are real fast, the heavy mechs slow, though with 3rd person view only (for now - develepers stated working on cockpit view) and crazy jump jets it sometimes feels like you're piloting a figurine on a tabletop not a multi ton mech.  It has some large, wide open levels and I've had some pretty intense battles.There is a decent selection of pre made Mechs, some you'll even reckognize form Battletech or Mechwarrior.  They all have different capabilities and the developrs have done a good job making some feel and handle very different, some refinement is needed.The graphics are right now fairly rough but I expect texture updates eventually.All in all, if you're looking for arcade type combat in mechs try it out, I  imagine after some updates the controls might turn a bit more.....realisitic?  Is that possible in a fictional game?  Anyway, hopefully you get what I'm trying to say.If you love giant mech games and know what buying early aceess can mean and the risks involved (such as games never being finished or taking radical turns and not being the same game you bought) then I recommend it, as it's on sale (or was) and 5$ is decent to support the developrs.If not a huge fun but a moderate fan, or missed the sale, it might be worth waiting to see the game in a more polished state before decding to support it or not, and you might get another sale in the meantime.6.5/10 at full price, 7.5/10 on sale........for the time beingMaybe I'll see you on the battlefield!"

Maybe you will not like the alpha because of it's lack of content and tutorials, but it's only going to be getting better.Update: Newest update fixed the issue I was having with finding lazers :D Safe to say that the game is much better already and I can't wait to see what the next update will add!"

New contract missions give something for players looking for Single Player missions to do.Early Access so there's obviously some bugs still. Considering that, this game is still pretty strong and well done. Especially at this early alpha phase. I'm a huge fan of the game so far and can't wait to get into more battles. There are maps both big and small to allow quick brutal mech matches as well as more drawn out conflicts. I personally prefer the small maps.Learning the weapons so far is the trickiest bit, and building your own loadouts. As this game develops it's definitely one to keep an eye on if you like mech games.The new update for Faction Wars is looking great too.NOTE: This review was written BEFORE I started helping out with the game."

Totally worth it. Best mech game I have seen since Mechwarrior 4:Mercs and it's still in EA!Owned about a dozen or more mech games over the years. Being a fan of mech games especially the Mechwarrior series. I longed for a good mech game like this one.I saw a lot of potential in this game when I discovered it just over a month ago. I liked the rpg elements, the different types of mechs, weapons, maps, etc. It was small and needed work but not a lot to complain about. It was the best thing out there and I wanted to see where it was headed.As soon as I opened the beta release it reminded me of the training levels of the good old days of Mechwarrior. Everything looked better than I could have ever imagined it.Been waiting many years for something like this. $14.99 is nothing.  I would easily pay double for an hd version of Mechwarrior 3 Gold if it were released on Steam.These are the types of Early Access that get you really excited. Seeing a good product become a whole lot better. Become something exceptional. All the improvements in this new beta release 4/10/2017 are a milestone. Everything looks just fantastic.Another plus with the update is now I can use my Ferrari Racing Wheel to pilot my mech. Believe it or not racing wheels are an absolute blast to use as a controller on mech games. Had some annoying issues with the controller setup but once I got through it no problem. Seemed to be the axis pulling one way every time I set up a new button. Hopefully this gets resolved soon."

,Recommended,266470,11791004,"Posted: 20 August, 2014",all,solarPULSAR | SteaмLadder.com,"Mech games in general are very niche these days. There are a ton of dev sponsored events but they usually have quite a few players and the one i was able to make it to was extremely fun. Expecting ea games that are niche to have large playerbases is a false perception that is probably influenced by ea titles like dayz or rust that have very large playerbases skewing the fact most ea games just dont draw that many people no matter how good they are. these are mostly indie devs without large marketing budgets.This game has the framework to be great. There are, in my opinion, certain mechanics missing that would make the game more dynamic and fun, i.e. rocketjumping on the ground, so like ac3 being able to boost for a short time to gain some speed and be a dodging mechanic all in one. The sniper rifles and long range weapons are a great start to make this game go in the direction the devs seem to want (from my experience so far) as a more militaristic, average pased mech game relying on positioning, aim, and teamwork.Not to mention, the devs on this game, unlike many many ea titles, actually listen to and respond to the playerbase. I mean the real intention of ea is to help developers develop and finish the game youre purchasing....right? Ive mentioned a few ideas to the devs so far, and i wont say I had anything to do with them adding it in, but for example the long range weapons i suggested a few months ago, well guess what? They put it in the game! And its a really great addition. In my opinion this factor alone makes this game well worth a measly fifteen dollars.This game will grow over time, with the cockpit views, more and more weapons and mech types, more customization of the mechs themselves, better ai, better graphics (already looking really sharp with the shader changes), and of course, the soon to be redmund favorite of faction wars. I havent been this excited for the future of an ea title in a long time.Sure there arent many people in servers very often, but I mean Im not sure what youd expect from an ea game like this. Plus the devs come from a background of writing backends for netcode of games with other studios (i might be wrong on the terminology) gives me great confidence that MP play will be stable and lag/choke free in the future, especially when your faction might lose their last territory from a missle lagging and winning someone a match.10/10 must buy for mech lovers."

The best part about it is building and trying out the mechs. Some of the problem is that no one is playing so you have to play by yourself and the bots are not very smart, or maybe too smart they go hide in the ocean. Every once in a while you have a great game against the bots, but not on every board.I would like to see a board where you have unlimited ammo.The bots would not have to be strong but they need to attack and spawn more of them. I love shooting at them. Missiles are great but you don’t have enough of them need a way to reload on the spot. Long way back to the base to reload waste to much time.Look at some of the games like the Day of Defense on their zombie mode it has wave of bots attacking you. Old game still a lot of people playing. Make a map similar to them. But have them mech bots attackingOn a lot of your boards you have no way to reload after you run out of ammo. This is just sad because some of these are good maps the bots attack.I really hope you all do something for this game fast its dyeing.More weapons. More ammo. Attacking bots.  Different maps. Unlimited ammo. This game could be greatSince this game came out I’ve enjoyed it enough that I’ve bought a few more Mech games and played them, they’re fun, but I keep coming back to this one. I really would love to see you all make it. But I think you need a few more game designers to come up with something different to make it playable.I have the most kills on this game and possibly the most hours.

I really have a hard time telling anyone to buy this game please do something that will change that.I will say this if you like building mechs. and trying them out. somewhat of a slow game buy it.
