,Recommended,266840,32608868,Posted: 20 June,all,SnareBear,"It's a great game. Not sure exactly what the HD remaster brought to the table since the game feels and looks exactly like I remember it 15+ years ago, or whenever it came out. If you miss the game then it's probably worth buying.Cons:Atlantians:OPNorse:OPRanked:Only works in quickmatch mode now. You can't host a game and set it to ranked anymore. This kind of sucks because some races are better than others at certain maps and in quickmatch the maps are randomized. Also you could have a 1600 rating and get paired against someone who's rating is like 348232321434332. You will get wrecked a lot.When you queue for ranked youre either going to get paired against someone incredible or someone terrible. This is because there are very few active players and things are pretty much split into three categories: ""Veterines"" (who will wreck you), ""noobs"" who are just happy to be playing a game that their gateway or macbook can can actually manage to run on integrated graphics, and ""veterine noobs"" who used to play the game when they were kids but used cheat codes and never got good. Me? I'm somewhere in the middle.Also people will pause the game in ranked, expecting you to back out of the game out of frustration once you give up trying to figure out how to unpause it. Here's a tip: just hit the pause button on your keyboard. You need to know that to play ranked."
,Not Recommended,266840,20833166,"Posted: 29 January, 2016",all,John,"Ordinarily, I don't write reviews - but I've always been pretty invested in the Ensemble Studios games and seeing what Microsoft and Skybox have done with one of their all-time legends has pushed me into comment.Age of Mythology: Extended Edition. Ordinarily, to extend something means to prolong it or make it bigger somehow but if you're hoping for new content, this game does not have any. It's just the same game you played back in 2003 - but that's not so bad, because that game was great. This however, isn't - and there's some vital reasons as to why:1 - The Multiplayer.The most important aspect of any Real Time Strategy game is its multiplayer community and Age of Mythology has always had a creative and thriving one. This Extended Edition would too - if the multiplayer actually worked. You don't need me to tell you, just go check out the Support forum for this game. The game suffers from consistent crashes, desync, stuttering, framedrops and lag when attempting an online game. The developers blame ""ancient bugs"" left over from the original game despite the fact that none of these bugs were actually present in the 2003 release and accusing the now defunct Ensemble Studios (thanks Microsoft) for being responsible for your own mistakes is downright cowardly. disrespectful and lazy especially seeing as you're now flogging their product to an unaware market.2 - The Single Player.The AI during Single Player matches is bizarre, eclectic and at often times completely incomprehensible. Prone to suddenly stopping all activity halfway through a match for completely banal reasons (there was no food in their line of sight, you spawned too close to them etc) every Random Match is essentially a roll-of-the-dice of whether or not the AI feels like playing along this time. This problem has only been made worse by the addition of the new, COMPULSORY DLC which has 'updated' the AI to coincide with the introduction of a new civilization. Unfortunately, those who don't purchase the DLC are still obligated to download the patch, meaning they suffer from all of the bugs whilst receiving none of the reward.3 - The DLC.Most likely what drew you to this Steam page in the first place seeing as this game hasn't seen a real increase in playerbase in almost a year. I followed the development of the DLC for a good few months and have been heavily invested in it. The attitude of the developers and their 'effort' as far as producing quality content goes is detestable. Aside from the rather invested and community-involved attitude from those at ForgottenEmpires (a small team of fans), comment and involvement from the lead developers (Skybox) has consisted of grade-1♥♥♥♥♥♥all. They spent a good few months assuring us the DLC would contain strictly new, fresh content without any reskinning, repackaging or rebranding of existing content and that turned out to be a complete lie. They also lied about having playtested the game for balance - admitting during a public streaming of the game (you can find it on Youtube) that they purposefully left the DLC broken and unbalanced as a means of making people have to play it. The DLC itsels is incredibly broken as of writing this (again, check the Support forum), with half the playerbase unable to access the DLC at all and the other half jokingly trying to laugh off the regret of their purchase.One of the developers admitted on the Subreddit that they are currently ""using the public to beta test the game"" - meaning that if you buy this DLC you are not getting content, you are buying into the opportunity to test unfinished content. This coupled with the fact that the developers openly laughed at the idea of fixing the Multiplayer (again, check the stream) tells me that we aren't dealing with incompetent developers - we're dealing with scam artists.I don't like having to write this sort of stuff about any Ensemble Studios IP because it sucks seeing their legacy♥♥♥♥♥♥on by untalented coat-tail riders, but if it means discouraging people from wasting their money on what is essentially a gigantic bug test, then it feels somewhat worthwhile. Only buy this if you absolutely *must* play Age of Mythology again and don't want to go through the effort of pirating the old copy and getting it to work - but know that this is not the Age of Mythology you played ten years ago and it certainly is not a well-supported or active game."
,Recommended,266840,12978226,"Posted: 16 November, 2014",all,Raysh,"Age of Mythology is the classic, mythology based spinoff of Age of Empires, and boy was it fun. But does Age of Mythology  Extended Edition live up to the original? In many ways, very much so, though the price tag might dissaude you unless you're a huge fan, (like I am).If you've played Age of Mythology before, you know exactly how this game works. If not, here a basic gist of it. It plays much like Age of Empires 2; you have to collect resources, specifically food, wood and gold, in order to fund your armies, economies, technologies and advancement. sounds basic enough, and all the races work similarly in regards to these resources. The difference comes in the fourth resource: Favour. Favour is generated differently depending on which race you are playing. For instance, the greeks generate favour through worship, the egyptians through building monuments, the norse through heroes and fighting, and the atlanteans through having more settlements.Favour is the special resource, which ties into the major mechanic of Age of Mythology: Gods and God Powers. There are 12 major gods, 3 for each of the races, and these determine starting bonuses for you when you start the game. the gods also have minor gods to choose each time you advance an age, with a total of 36 minor gods, each offering different bonuses and god powers. For instance Hades gives you the Sentinel God Power, that creates stone sentinels to watch over your town centre, but in the second age, you can choose Athena, who allows you to train minotaurs and the Restoration God power which can heal your units.Aside from the new favour mechanic, for the major part it plays like the age of empires games. Build Army, upgrade, and take care of your population cap and economy. Rock paper scissors, for basic units, (cavalry beats archers who beat infantry), but add heroes and myth units which can turn the tide of battle. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer are fun, and with the new release, there is a rebirth in the multiplayer, though not as big as the heyday of AoM.As being essentially a remake (a la Age of Empires 2 HD Edition), AoM:EE is actually fairly bug free, and while it definitely shows its age, the added subtle lighting effects, water and shadows do help to make look better. It is definitely very playable, and for fans of the original, it shouldn't even be a bother.The campaign is just as memeroable as always, a hunt through Greece, Egypt, Scandinavia and finally Atlantis in order to stop a power hungry cyclops from releasing Kronos, King of the Titans; followed by A New Atlantis, set a number of years later,where you are tricked into releasing the Titans, and must stop them at all costs.Overall, Age of Mythology: Extended Editon is fun, unique and offers up plenty of value, with 50 singleplayer missions, skrimishes, and now revived multiplayer, though for those who still have a copy of Age of Mythology and The Titans expansion, it might not add a great deal. Definitely recommend everyone else (who's a fan of older RTSes)."

76561198080275701,Recommended,266840,12316473,"Posted: 1 October, 2014",all,Trench Dog,"I wrote a review for this a while back, and I can say with confidence many issues have been sorted out, but some are still persistent.If you have never played this game, I am going to say right now to buy this game and play it. The campaign and its storyline is great, the factions are unique and well fleshed out and balance, for the most part, is achieved with some minor discrepencies/exploits which with experience can be learned to be countered.I will say that the game is not in its glory days anymore as this IS a re-release of a fairly old title. But the multiplayer is also active enough to have a competitive community and there is a revival in the scenario community to experience a taste of the legacy of AoM mapmakers, I suggest looking onhttp://aom.heavengames.com/downloads/for more or the Steam workshop downloads provided.But lets start with the actual meat of the game for anyone reading for determining whether to buy this:The Extended Edition brings many new improvements over old Age of Mythology and the Titans expansion included, water and other graphics are overhauled and improved significantly. Graphics in general have been improved over the original and the game looks much more vibrant and detailed. This makes playing the singleplayer campaign, which is still one of the better campaigns of an RTS I have played, much more enjoyable.A new online server is also available for multiplayer gameplay and while its nowhere even close to the glory days of ESO in terms of activity and the amount of scenario makers, some old faces are there both in competitive gameplay and with old mapmakers, and some newer map makers such as myself have been sprouting up. In terms of connection these days it really depends on whose actually in the game but as long as you're computer isn't a toaster your connection and running of this game should go forward without a hitch.However there is still some bugs that are highly irritating that remain. Desync errors still happen too frequently for my tastes and this wouldn't be so much a problem if it didn't lower the rating of those involved in ranked matches. When someone is on the verge of victory and then a desync error occurs to make them lose rating... its understandable someone would be angry.There is also more visible lag and connection issues between players then there was on the old AoM in certain instances, such as on certain scenarios or with people with very bad connection to begin with. And the Extended Edition is notable in how it actually lags your computer- some of us may remember we could browse the internet with Age of Mythology running in windowed mode or running other programs while we wait for a game; while this isn't prevented and is still possible the speed of which you do so is stifling and I would not recommend it at all now. (Nor would I recommend it in matches even back then, but if you're in lobby just idling, waiting for your friend to host that game...)I suggest if you are buying this, do not play on your toaster or similar dinosaur computer, this is an updated version of Age of Mythology meant to be played on semi modern machines.And as for scenario editors who wish to return to making maps for this game: The online multiplayer community is in desperate need of scenario revival. There is scenarios still being played from time to time but the newer population of competitive players is either unaware of most of the maps or simply do not host them, mostly the former. As for the editor itself, for all intents and purposes its more or less the same as what we know, but there is some notable differences now.The differences boil down to some old trigger techniques not working, and now causing horrible lag. The old trick of looping Move Army To to move your spawned units to a location, looping it within the trigger editor now causes horrible lag and no longer just simply makes them keep moving there. It acts as if the computer stops their units and tells them to move there, acting as if the loop was just restarting and stopping the order instead of merely continuing it as it did in the past.There is also UI changes to the editor, and while the function is largely the same it takes a bit getting used to. I can say with confidence though the editor is still fairly user friendly and easy to learn, though trying to find experienced mappers to help you with your project is a little difficult in terms of looking on the lobby- you'll have to consult various forums like AoM heaven or pitch it on the steam forums for this game somewhere. I myself can help with things too, and even old legends like Nottud are still around if you look...So it boggles down to this, overall: Should you buy this game if you are new, and should you buy this game if you already have age of mythology, the original and its expansion, to relive your nolstalgia?If you are new, refer to the top. Yes.If you are an old and musty returning player like me, Yes, but don't expect it to be total brass and shine throughout the entire game. There is some grime to be worked out with this still but I can say with confidence there has been legitimate work and attention on this game to improve it and fix bugs.(p.s Potato, if you review my review im going to shoot you and feed you to a chimera, not only was your review pointless, it was awful in its critique and if anything uninformative. No one cares about grammar to that extent, it's all about presentation, and the clarity of my review was fine. That is all :D )"

They knew there were going to be problems with this game upon release, it is disgusting to think that any company would release a product which is not up to scratch especially since the game was already released. I didn't pay the already expensive price to play a beta of a game that already exists. They have not delivered in my opinion, the AI is still terrible, the Multiplayer is lagging (reason I bought this game) and the frame rate is questionable for a game like this, the lighting effects are nothing special if not distracting and the menus are different (compared to the originals) but either way, re-mastered or not, the menus fulfilled their purpose, to be menus. I don't see how this warrants at £20 price tag. To make matters worse me and my friends are encountering problems with the steam overlay which is hindering our multiplayer experience. The steam workshop is also not working.I do not recommend buying this until the price drops and the problems with it are fixed, I will not trust this company again I thought AOE2 should have been a good indication of how they handle projects like these, I feel silly to have used the benefit of the doubt.Age of Mythology (when it is working) however is an excellent strategy game for competitive play, the multiplayer is excellent and the different civilizations are unique in terms of units, technologies and strategies that can be applied, it makes for a fresh experience on an age old formula, If only they continued after Age of Empires 3."

That said, if you are interested in single player or have amazing internet connection, go right ahead.In Short - There is a compounded latency issue. Animation quality is directly proportional to connection quality. One player with a bad connection (Or a large number of players) will slow your game. And when it slows down your game, it slows down everything causing animations to lag and glitch. They’ve updated the server client code in the Extended Edition, where they didn't need to (causing terrible bugs).In Long: Instead of a dedicated server setup. AOM now uses a peer to peer connection. The Pros are that you don't need to create servers, or port forward. But the downside is that the next iteration of the game cannot continue until every player has received information from every other player.This means that with more players, more information is required to be sent before a game iteration occurs. Additionally, with one player with a high latency, that latency affects every single player within the game. Currently with this problem, AOM game speed slows down, affecting EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF GAMEPLAY. This includes MODEL ANIMATION (Imagine bad connection = laggy and glitchy character models).However, this game would have been fine it they either:When the game speed is slowed down, change the timings of the model animations to match the new game speed (Just play on lightning speed to compensate).…Or just kept the old dedicated server engine for AOM.It saddens me that I cannot play this game reasonably with my friends, and I don’t want others to be disappointed.

As a game, it's wonderful and has stood the test of time. You have a wide array of very different strategies and tactics you can use, the different races all feel substantially unique from one another, and you can pick various major and minor deities to worship which each tweak your play style to suit your individual preferences better!The units are fairly unique from one another, there's lots of interesting mythological things like giants, pegasi, sphinxes and so on, and the economic aspects are rather enjoyable as well, which is rare for a strategy game. For an example of the economic stuff, look to the egyptians who can have their pharoah empower a building to make it build faster or boost the resources given to it, or that the atlanteans carry carts with them so they don't have to wander all the way back to town to drop off resources.There's always sort of a rock/paper/scissors thing going on, and no one unit is overpowered... buuuuut. Ah, yeah, there's always a but isn't there? It's a big fat butt in this case. Several of them.Well, some of what I just mentioned isn't super accurate. A lot of the units are very, very similar with little difference at all other than their stats - special abilities are pretty much reserved for mythological units and the god powers can only be invoked once per game instead of on a cooldown so they're not that impressive most of the time. Generally speaking, your units may look different and be better tasks, but one soldier is pretty much the same as any other soldier, other than what they do bonus damage against.That's another issue... the ""balance"" of the game, if you can call it that, is kind of wonky. If you look to other strategy games, such as the blizzard games of warcraft 3 or starcraft 1 or 2, the difference between being ""good"" against another unit or ""bad"" is generally 150% normal damage vs 50% normal damage in return. It's a significant difference and makes it possible for masses of units to fight things they're not that good against so long as you severely outnumber them. In AoM... well, you get things like a x15 damage multiplier... it's kind of absurd. If you aren't fighting something you deal bonus damage to, you may as well not be fighting at all.This balance also has the problem that the ""rock, paper scissors"" moteif that AoM has going for it kind of breaks down with mythological units. Oh, you like your sphinxes? Too bad. Sure, they look big and strong, with much higher stats than normal infantry... but if the enemy has even a single hero, the bonus damage from heroes to myth units is so absurd that you may as well never bother making myth units. Especially against the greeks who have some of the most powerful and cheapest heroes which take forever to kill since nothing does bonus damage against heroes. The game claims normal infantry are the counter to heroes, but they really aren't.The AI and mechanics make turtling not an overly useful strategy as well - all, literally all defensive structures deal piercing damage, and siege weapons usually have 80-99% resistance to piercing. Walls are easily destroyed, and the AI just sends wave after wave after wave of the same small units over and over so you'll probably never be able to rebuild a wall once it's damaged, even with the silly fast building speed in the game. So if you like to turtle and just tech up for long periods of time, you're going to find it's a nuisance - not difficult, just annoying, especially since the AI tends to ignore military units to attack peasants mindlessly. You can work around those things, but it's irritating instead of fun.Still, the game is fun as a whole. There's no denying that. As strategy games go, even for the minor nuisances it has, it's still one of the best, and by far the best of the age of empires series by leaps and bounds over any other. Yeah, the game balance is a bit wonky, but it sorta kinda works still. Really, it's fun in a way that more serious games like starcraft aren't. Starcraft II has by far a better campaign mode, but honestly I'd say the skirmishes in AoM are vastly superior to the skirmishes in SC2 surprisingly enough, and I have a platinum rating on SC2 so make of that what you will.So if the game's still very fun after so many years... what's wrong with it? Why the downvote?Well... this version... sucks, to put it mildly.Example: do you have a computer that can run Evolve at 120FPS? Well expect to have dips below 10FPS on AoM.The ""new features"" are things that honestly have no real impact on the game. A tiny little mini campaign is kinda... nice I guess? But let's be honest, the vast bulk of a strategy game's lifespan and value comes from its skirmish mode which this doesn't change in the slightest. The day night cycle is... negligible, as is much of everything else.The glitches that are brought, such as crashes, freezing, framerate drops, and actually a significantly reduced AI kind of diminish the game. The original was better because it actually worked. This version... you've got a 50/50 chance of finishing a mission without it being finished for you by a glitch of some sort or another. These bugs have been around for over a year now, so don't expect them to ever get patched.The price point is also a major issue - I was annoyed enough as it was that AoM was still trying to charge $20 when it was a decade old. Then they came out with the ""extended"" version... and now they want over $35 for it. Yeaaaaaaaaaaahno. Get it on sale, but that's it.Actually, you know what? Buy AoM: extended edition on sale... and then download a hacked copy of the original after you've paid for this one, and play the hacked one instead because it's flat out going to play better than this. That's right, I just told you to pay for the game but play a hacked one. That should tell you something about the quality of the game - the game itself is fine, but this version isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Oh, it's a computer title. It's not printed on paper. Yeaaaah it's worth less than $0 as it is.Oh well.But I didn't get the chance to pay for AoM when it first came out years ago, and honestly, AoM as a game is worth paying for to encourage further development of games such as this. Seriously, support AoM:EE simply because if enough people do, maybe they'll make a sequel. Yeah, the extended edition sucks, yeah, it doesn't deserve your money, and yeah, a hacked version of the original is simply the better game... but AoM itself deserves a reward for existing, even if they dropped the ball on this one. Into the sewer. Sorry, I don't have hip waders, I'm not going to go dig it out of the slime and sewage.If you do, however, have the hip waders? It's a magnificient game beneath a veneer of crap, so if you can wash it off, it's well worth it. I just can't recommend this release is all. Even at -75% off."

I am Odin, and my thunder god son had the audacity to attack me during the opening 30 minutes of this random map skirmish.The ludicrousness of this scenario, as mythical creatures of various origins trundle in over peaceful farmland to murder everyone in sight, was Mythology's strength over Ensemble's Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings when it was released in 2002. Mythology's colourful range of high-level fantasy creatures make the final act of any skirmish much more exciting than units of historical repute did in Age of Kings. Kraken trouble the seas, dragon-like nidhoggs circle the skies and hydra grow a head for every enemy they slay.Age of Mythology does feel antiquated, but it is still a lot of fun. It wasn't a notably innovative RTS at release, mostly built on '90s ideas, but it did take Ensemble's blend of Civ-style city management and more conventional military RTS ideas to its creative peak, as well as making the series fully 3D for the first time.The upgraded effects of the Extended Edition, most noticeably the shiny-looking water, help contemporise Mythology, but the character models are the strongest signs that this is a decade-old game. AI is a bit of an issue, too. On a moderate difficulty, the enemies attack predictably in medium-sized waves while rarely putting up an overwhelming defence of their own territories.I don't hold that against Mythology, though, because it is still cathartic to steamroll the AI on random maps. The online multiplayer, too, means you won't be short on smarter opponents, and it seems to be running well, even if the process of finding a game you can join feels a bit arduous.The Extended Edition isn't short on single-player content, either. Collected here are the Titans expansion and the shorter Golden Gift DLC campaign, in addition to the original's mammoth story mode.Each campaign level is prefaced by in-engine cutscenes of hilariously low production values. Voice acting sounds like the product of three almost-drunk friends being handed the keys to a recording studio for an afternoon. This shortfall is probably another sign of its age and the industry standard of the time, but otherwise I think this is one of the better RTS campaigns of its day in the variety of the mission structure.You rarely feel like you're doing the exact same thing twice, and the parameters can change from survival to deathmatches and surprise ambushes. The impressively in-depth Scenario Editor helps to extend the singleplayer's lifespan, and with Workshop support, there's no fear of running dry of stuff to do.Age of Mythology still has a lot of value beyond nostalgia.This isn't a total remake, so don't go in expecting one. The Extended Edition is still a really well-paced and entertaining RTS, one that revels in over-the-top imagery and remains a one-off in subject matter within the oeuvre of the sadly departed Ensemble."

As a kid I grew up playing this game, it was by far the most iconic game of my childhood, which is why I was fine paying the outrageous price. While I'm not refunding the game nor am I disappointed enough to regret the purchase, I cannot praise anyone for somehow making the graphics worse than they use to be, now in 2017.  I'm not sure what they were going for here, but these retextures are beyond trash, the original unit look was much better, genuinely don't know how they managed make it look worse years latter. Other complaints are perhaps less reasonable, yet still worth mentioning for newcomers.  This is something I was hoping they would fix, the difficulty settings and how the AI behaves is extremely annoying... Easy mode is a cake walk, you wont even have fun, but you will have more fun than dealing with the constant spam of units from moderate+ difficulty. I suppose if you're a fan of games like startcraft this wont bother you as much, I enjoy a slower pace of gamplay for games like these and changing the AI stances to ""protectors"" or ""builder"" doesn't seem to change the fact that they will spam units to attack you constantly, to the point it ruins the relaxing aspect of games like these and turns it in to a spam fest.  Are there ways to deal with it? Sure, It's just really annoying. What I end up doing is barricading my cities with 2-3 layers of walls that have watch towers in between, it helps deal a but with the enemy constantly spamming troops to harass your farmers and such, but even then, it doesn't always do the trick. Unfortunately not a game to have a beer with and relax because of this, it's not that it makes the game to hard, it makes it spammy and annoying. The rest of the game is great just like it use to be, my other copy of the game cost me 6$ though, I lost it and this cost me 30$ which needless to say is ridiculous pricing aiming to exploit your nostalgia for the game, that they couldn't even keep the same textures for or make some basic tweaks/improvements to justify the cost."

76561198341105488,Not Recommended,266840,28612237,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,voldemort,"I got this game on 12/22/2016. After reading the numerous reviews about how I should not buy this game and play aom on voobly instead, I decided to go ahead and buy it anyway since I love aom (1800 rr back in 07' ;) ). I suppose I just was not satisfied because the reviews did not actually go into detail about anything that I thought was important. I am going to do my best, though, to give you the details of how terribly disappointing this game has been for me for the past couple days, even though I don't tend to give bad reviews because I don't like hurting other people's businesses, However, I consider this game a scam.I'm going to start with the China campaign, since that's where I started. The first issue arose when I restarted the first scenario, since I was kinda screwing around with looking at the new units and the AI got ahead of me. When I restarted, I was astonished to find that I was in the Archaic Age, rather than the Classical Age, like I had been in the game before. In addition, once I collected 400 food and built my first temple, I could not even advance to the Classical Age. Therefore, I was stuck trying to fight the AI with immortals from my town center, which was basically impossible once they started sending in human units. I restarted again and again, but could not resolve the issue. I decided to finally restart the whole game and wait out the cinematic all the way through again, and I finally got the game to start in the Classical Age. I can't say for sure that this bug exists within the game or if there is an issue with my computer. However, I reinstalled a fresh version of windows 8.1 about a week ago and there's basically nothing on my computer, so if it's a problem with my computer, then that's really a problem with poor compatability caused by the developers. The other possibility is it could be an issue caused by the Ekanta user interface mod that I dowloaded for, and I actually haven't tested that yet. However, Ekanta is a popular UI and I would be surprised if no one figured that out yet. After beating the first and the second scenarios, I got to the third, when I discovered that I once again could not advance to the classical age, despite having a temple and 400 food. I thought that this possibly could be like the original AOM campaign, which don't let you advance (although the option doesn't even show up for those), but was once again flooded by human units and forced to fight with the only unit I could make, which were immortals from my town center. This time I restarted and restarted and no matter what could not begin in whatever age i was supposed to, or resolve whatever the issue was this time. However, i couldn't advance, and did the only thing I could which was build my TC and either THRILL OF VICTORY, or spam O CANADA bears (recommend the O CANADA's if you run into this issue). I can't remember the order of the campaign past this because I just wanted to get it over with. Another one of the scenarios (there are only like 9 of these but they are almost all terrible) has you fight off an army. This time, when I restarted I discovered that my troops went from having heavy upgrades to having no upgrades. This bug has an easy fix, though, If you just restart and wait for part of the cinematic to finish before skipping; then your troops will once again be heavily armored. The final bug with the campaign that I ran into so far was once again that I could not age on another scenario, this time after building an armory since I actually started in the Classical Age. I was eventually able to beat the AI's champion, fully upgraded units with my clasical units after mixing in some monkey king myth units. So that ends most of what I want to say about the campaign. The final issue I want to bring up comes from watching a streamer play as thor against a chinese player in a 1v1. Once he got to the mythic age, he discovered that he mentioned that he had no units that could counter cataphract, which are Chinese counter-infantry cavalry, without also being countered by the cataphract themselves. Norse does not have an archer or a cavalry unit which counters cavalry, which would be the only two options, unless using myth units. Thanks for reading and please don't buy this game!"

Some of the new mods really breathe life, even into the look of the game. Heck, I use three I've subscribed to, just for the menu changes. That's just the smallest details for Workshop support. Many are even better than that as far as altering gameplay, textures, UI, etc..... Then there's the price of 29.99. It's steep, even with the Titans expansion with it.

I will be honest that I don't know the source of this lag, but I can conclude and deduce that it isn't Steam and it definitely isn't on my end (isp/pc/graphics). For someone that is re-purchasing this game because I already know it's great, it's sad that this issue isn't already fixed on a game that is so old. The main audience you that is thrilled to play this would be that such as myself, returning for the glory days of this game when it was one of the best. Get yourself together.

Picking and sticking to an 'overpowered god' from the start is not really possible, as gods are very much rock-paper-scissors with each other. You can pick a certain god that counters the Norse (Gaia, for example) which would be destroyed by the Greek. You do get the feeling as you go along that certain Gods have better abilities than others, although I feel this is largely down to personal perference. Loki for example, has the ability for his Hersirs to randomly spawn Myth units into the battle, which maybe considered 'OP' by those who are in a militaristic war against them. BUT, Hersirs are very weak to arrows. Gather a few archers and you're back in the game. But then they can build calvary. But then you can build spearmen, and it continues.In terms of units, there isn't that much variety however it is not necessarily the units that you pick, but how you build the groups. When playing as the Greeks, two horseman, two archers and two infantry will survive longer than six archers.I played this game many years ago and am happy to see it make a HD relaunch, however honestly there really isn't much difference. My main 'pet peeve' with this game is the online play which, to be brutally honest, frustrates me to no end. There are three aspects which irritate me, those being;1) Sync errors. You can be 40 minutes into a game and you will suddenly get a pop up saying 'Saving: Sync Error' which is an 'oh ****' moment. Your 40 minutes is now worthless, as you will now be back at the Main Menu screen. What a waste of time. They offer no explanation, no 'just kick the out-synced player', EVERYONE is put back to the Main Menu with nothing to show for the last 40 minutes. Oh, and did I mention that some players use programs to force sync errors if they are losing? Yeah.2) There's no option to vote-kick players midgame. The only option you have to kick a player is when they're about to disconnect, at which point the ENTIRE game comes to a halt for 30 seconds while you all vote. The voting, by the way, is pointless. Regardless of which option you pick (Continue or Wait) you will be forced to wait the full 30 seconds, even if the vote in unanimous.3) The program itself. The program itself can randomly just shut down. You can be destroying the entire map and then your game will just suddenly shut down with no warning as if you've pressed Alt + F4.Besides the above GLARING technical errors that I am in absolute disbelief haven't been fixed after x years since the game's release, the gameplay is actually very good. This is one of the most played, soon to be the most played game in my library. I would recommend, but I wish they'd sort out the gaping holes in their ship."

The original Age of Mythology is getting quite old now and would definitely show its age by today's standards. Although, even that would not keep me from enjoying it just the same. The visuals are beautiful and vibrant for the time paired with some relaxing music at the leisure of building your empire and fierce battle music when fighting with some of mythology's best creatures. The user interface is similar to most such as Age of Empires or War Craft III. The game controls and runs smoothly with very few bugs and glitches. The gods that are available are well known ones from a few different pantheons from around the world; Greek, Egyptian, Atlantean, Norse, and Chinese. Now the differences between the games is this: improved graphics, more stable and support for higher resolutions and other graphical enhancements, video streaming support, achievements, and an expansion. With this version, I remembered the days of the best RTS games I had ever played and thoroughly enjoyed them again. I would recommend this game to fans of RTS games or even fans of mythology in general."

I was overly hyped to see that Steam was picking up AOM considering I lost the disk some time ago. Let's go over the game, shall we?(This will be solely based off of Age of Mythology itself, rather than any updates or such done by the Extended Edition.)Campaign32 levels, 3 different factions, interesting heroes and a compelling story. Barely any levels are the same, with each being unique and exciting. While a few (and I mean a very few) are a tad bland, that should be no reason to turn someone away from it. Not to mention the Atlantis campaign, which adds 12 more levels to play on with another new story and heroes tying to the first campaign in many ways.SkirmishWhen playing skirmish, the game provides a fun and (admittedly slightly repetative) experience to better oneself before possibly attempting multiplayer or the campaign on a harder difficulty. The player can choose any of the factions and their respective gods, giving a nice plethora of play styles. I do recommend keeping away from the ""Titan"" difficulty, however, as the AI gains a lot of handicaps.MultiplayerOh boy, multiplayer. I've seen a lot of great things from it. New maps, game mods, (usually) differing play styles from other players. It offers a good zone for both new players and pros, but I do recommend avoiding many ranked matches unless you're at the top of your game, because trust me, the other player almost always is. It's a great way to spice things up if you've beaten the campaign and are tired of the AI in skirmishes.Extended Edition + China DLCThe extended edition and China DLC are honestly... Disappointing. I'd say avoid the China DLC unless you're dying for new content so badly you'd do anything for it (which I'd even recommend the workshop before the DLC). The Chinese army is very gimmicky, and everything feels reused, with little, if anything, being brand new. It's also rather buggy. I, myself, haven't even beat the campaign yet, it's just bland and boring. The Extended edition tried to amp up textures and such, but it makes some things ugly and unappealing, and I highly recommend getting a mod or two to fix these up.All in all, I say buy this game, be it the disc or the Steam version, avoid the China DLC and game on.

For it's time and even now its storyline, gameplay and graphics are still quite good. What it definitely gets right is it doesn't just take the basics of mythology and used the same tired old tropes. It uses all manner of characters, creatures and phenomena from the 3 Civilizations and even for me some that I weren't even aware existed. You can tell alot of research and alot of thought went into this game.- Pros -- Relatively good graphics considering how old the game is.- Nice music- Good storyline- wide variety of characters and creatures- Creative ""god powers""- many hours of play time (is not a short game)- really, really good tools for making your own map/scenario- Each Civilization has their own unique way of generating favour with the gods- Cons -- You can for the most part train a bunch of myth units that are more effective than most regular units to fight with and win- Enemy AI seemingly uses the same tactic almost every time, using small harassing skirmishes of 8-10 units at a time (at least on easy difficulty)- Seemingly the best way to give yourself a chance at winning is build as many walls and towers as you can and order your troops into defensive stance so they dont split up chasing every enemy unit they see all around the map and then dying.All in all though this game is fantasic and if you had any kind of love of Mythology before this can do nothing but rekindle it and maybe even make you want to do some reading on your favourite characters/creatures. I highly recommend this game. :)8.5/10Also a nice comedic bonus is watching a Cyclops use the special attack of picking up a humanunit and throwing it (probably) to it's death is pretty damn amusing as well. :)"

However the review system on steam is ""Do you recommend this game?"" And there I say no. But do I recommend it to previous Age Of Mythology and Titans expansion players? Yes.This game is great fun especially if you play a lot of scenario maps, classics like escape are always good fun or tower defence. I barely ever play the base game my self I always play user generated game modes and while they are VERY good they are subject to the same bugs and crashes and flaws as the rest of the game. The desync bug seems very rare now for several months I havent had it but maybe thats just my luck. That said random crash to desktops can happen upon starting a match online. Some people report issues with running the game, even when they have a good hardware setup. It has been fine for me. I actually play in 1440p maxed capping my self at 60fps it seems to never drop without good reason.Most of the time I play without these crashes but when it does happen it is extremely frustrating as you can wait some times half an hour to fill a lobby with people. (online is not dead but its a small and close community.)So the run down is fans of the original, especially scenario players, will be happy with being able to play all of the new scenarios which are being developed by the same people who did all those years ago on AOM Heaven.Fans who played the original and mostly played supremacy and the occasional scenario like world map are still catered for but will not see much difference apart from the new OP chinese gods (they are the new atlantis). Though desyncs dont really happen now you may still get random crashes on launching a match.Those who never played before well it's a good rts even its base game supremacy mode which im still just as bad at is pretty fun and there are a lot of new players who play supremacy so you wont be alone. But you learn how buggy the game can be. Not so much in gameplay but stability. You may be better off with the original game using some third party software for online. Though if you do that the people you will play are going to be experienced players.Either way I think if you're going to buy this wait until there is a sale. It drops all the time during every major sale to quite a low price. And during those times instead of seeing 20-50 people in the general lobby during peak times you will see over 100 because of all the noobs. So its a good time to start and will save you some money.Don't buy this at full price."

Making it so that I can't select random for any options when playing against the computer since it crashes after searching for and selecteing dlc that I never purchased. The update was also designed so that all of the starting menus remind you that you don't have the dlc by showing gray boxes everywhere.

Being on Steam and the perks that it brings with it (intergrated online community, workshop, future updates) with all the content is the easiest way to play today. However, even after a some time, the multiplayer issues are still noticable, in fact for some it may even be a deal breaker. Speaking of which, despite my overall praise, the game is not updated all that much making the 20+ price tag for most regions outright steep so even if like me you are a long time fan, a sale being your best option. Thankfully that does come regularly.Overall the package is worth a buy for the right lower price by your own standard and the developers do have plans to update the game beyond simply another expansion (visuals, balance, servers), I myself will update this review a period following the release of the expansion as some of these issue are very important and should have been ironed out sonner, in the case of online.

,Recommended,266840,21095624,"Posted: 9 February, 2016",all,LukeDIP,"Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is an RTS that has in my opinion stood the test of time.  First and foremost this game is related almost directly to the Age of Empires collection. The big difference is the injection of Mythology and Gods instead of historical civilizations like in Age of Empires. A few different things have been changed but you will see about the same formulas being practiced.When I first started playing this game it was almost ten years ago. I had very slow internet but thankfully found this solid game on disk. I was amazed with the quality and the single player replayability. One of my favorite things is the simple and fun editor where you can make your own maps or your own challenges. I would mostly roleplay in which I would make up different battles and very own campaign. It was very satisfying when I could put time into my own ideas.I have always liked the resource race in this game as well where you start by hunting then move up to farming or knowing when to get that next woodcutting or mining upgrade. Managing your economy with your military plays a very large part too. There are many small things in this game that make it feel very well done, as an example when your units are upgraded it updates the armor and weapon textures. Little things like that have always appealed to me while playing because it makes me feel like the developers really cared about this game. I read about how the developers argued for days over the god powers to make sure they were balanced. I believe that's called making a good game to were you care so much about the fairness you push yourself and others that hard.Skybox is another story. I enjoy the fact steamworks is now into the game and instant modifications can be applied that enhance the way I play the game but they have done an ""ok"" job. The price is a little to much for a game that is this old. Right now is a sale for around $7 and I would recommend you buy it at a time like this but $30 on the other hand is just too much when the disk has been in the bargin bin for half a decade. I could go on about the desync issues but in the end I will recommend this game in its current state.Honestly I am just really happy this is on Steam. I have met so many of die hard fans that I would have never met playing offline so very long ago. It really makes me glad that the community still cares and likes to have a good time with this awesome relic.Thanks for reading."

With the new water, you can barely see fish through it, or units hiding in the water on the shore, the bloom is bad quality (even if you have a GTX Titan), the models (which haven't been HD'd) just don't suit the new lighting, they look all bubbly/oversmoothed and horrible, and the dynamic shadows look bad. I'm usually a graphics nut but I had to turn it all off and it's still ugly / hard to read.

Then, there are the abominable graphical glitches which can, at times, make the game unplayable necessitating a reset. At times the map won't load.

It will reset in the middle of a game, the entire game will close, the graphics will disintigrate, and all other assortments of frustrations.

,Not Recommended,266840,20945098,"Posted: 3 February, 2016",all,Charlie (voice-chat off),"Summary - The Chinese expansion is rushed, copy-pasted from existing things, and glitchy. The people who profit from this are not the ones who made the original Age of Mythology.Icons for Chinese buildings are re-used existing ones.Chinese god powers and soldiers are like copies of existing ones, just changed a little bit. For example, the chinese monk is the egyptian priest with a different model, texture, icon and description, and instead of converting animals he converts enemies. He waves his arms and makes the exact same chant, and the cursor turns into an Egyprian Ankh when you mouse-over enemies.Incorrect descriptions - The two Chinese heroes we start with are given Arkantos's description of special powers.Poor story-telling - Unlike the original campaign, the beginning of the Chinese campaign has very little story-telling. You are not introduced to the gods, and you just start already in the second age. We only have a brief introduction to the heroes.At the beginning of the campaign.../(SPOILER)\The heroes have to travel across China because when they realise there's evil afoot, a random peasant tells them to cross china, and so they do with no questions asked.\(SPOILER)/Graphic glitches on my new-ish computer - You can see flames if the ground is behind them, but not if the sky if behind them. When placing walls. the wall segment that is behind another is drawn in front of what is actually in front of it.Glitched first scenario in the Chinese campaign - You start in the Second age, but if you restart you are in the first age.It runs slowly.You can drag a box to select four soldiers and it will tell you you've selected only two, or the ""bamboo tree"" nearby.My fortified wall upgraded to an earthen wall.I got a steam card of Thor with a really bad picture on it, with the description ""The Norse god of lightning"". Thor is the god of thunder.This is my review after only getting to the second scenario in the Chinese campaign, because waiting to finish it to write the review would make it too late for the review to be helpful, because it's only just been released. Perhaps it's not their fault that the Chinese are so similar to the other ones, because there are only so many possibilities, and the three original races have already taken a share of the possibilities, but the lacking story-telling and the obviously reused artwork and code make it seem like the people who made it rushed it, or did not enjoy maknig it, or something like that. If it was released as a free mod then it would probably be well recieved, but it's been named an official expansion."

I just finished playing all three, and I can't get over how they overlooked the idea of having 3 distinct player races have separate strengths and weaknesses that accomodate most playstyles to an RTS. Of course, its ""easy"" campaign option makes the campaign a rewarding experience as you play through all three classes in 48 scenarios. I haven't really dug into the multiplayer yet, but if I did I would feel more than prepared after such an engaging campaign.If you were thinking about getting into franchises or RTS in general, this is the one in the series to get. AoE 2 is much too difficult for me to recommend right away, and the story in the third is far too bland and uninteresting. If you're struggling or you find it boring, play it on Twitch.

I have no interest in the multiplayer but from what I hear it's broken - thus defeating the purpose of its revival. The only hope is improved graphics which it does NOT offer AT ALL.

When I was a kid I had this game for the ds, only difference was it was turn based and it didnt really ruin the game for me... but it made a whole new experience. HOWEVER when I came to this, it kinda ruined it I guess cause it was rts? (ikr? ) but also im sort of a casual player when it comes to ensembles aoe games and i like to face bots that prove a challenge but that I can still beat. In this game, when I play a skirmish, because of the rts and the god powers it makes it a lot harder to do things. The sad thing to me is that you can only use god powers one time in a game. I feel like some god powers should be a cool down thing such as the one lightning bolt , sure it may take like 1 min to cooldown and perhaps a certain amount of favor but maybe that would be a better system.the big pros (and not all of them probably):- Different cultures, they add a lot of diversity to the game.- Titans are awesome and badass, you're screwed though if one's heading towards your base.BIG CONS (and not all of them... maybe?)- Thank god I got this on sale, no way I would pay 30$ for this not even or aoe 1.

At first I didn't have that problem, I was even able to play a few levels of the Chinese storymode, NOW IT'S DOING IT FOR NOT JUST THE STORYMODE BUT NOW FOR EVERY FACTION AND EVERY RANDOM MAP I TRY TO PLAY!!! WTF!!Let me be clear that I love Age of Empires. It's the best real time strategy game of all time, but compared to earlier entries like Age of Empires 2, AoMythology feels like it's lacking. The growth and movements are a lot slower than I remember them to be, and despite the game being remastered with better graphics of the environment and buildings they are still really poor in terms of units (they're basically a few crude shapes with arms). the system of heroes and myth units put a difficult wrench into the mix of unit advantages, and it seems no matter how much you upgrade they die very quickly unless you have an overwhelming force. The buildings compared to AoE2 are also much weaker. Whereas in AoE2 castles and towers could protect you from all sorts of forces, the defenses in Age of Mythology are practically made of cardboard. It almost makes artillery pointless because so long as you're willing to lose a couple of cheap units you can stab whole fortresses to death in a matter of moments, something you and the enemy could rarely do in Age of Empires 2.There is one thing Age of Mythology has that is better than other titles and that's the learning element. It won't teach much history, but when you click on unit icons it opens up a short description of the unit's stories in mythology for myth units or if it's a human unit it will have a small explanation of that unit's weapons or place in ancient history. Even clicking on a wild animal will bring up it's scientific name and other facts about it. For learning purposes, this is the best part of the game.All in all, I bought this game for the nostalgia and the new Chinese faction dlc, but feel it was not worth buying again. I much more recommend Age of Empires 2 because it is faster paced, more balanced, slightly cheaper, and has a lot more cultures to choose from."

I really like Age of Mythology, it's a classic RTS game with a lot of fun gameplay to offer however my negative review is regarding the terrible handling of this updated edition.Somehow a team of devs have managed to update an old♥♥♥♥♥game, add their own DLC to it and break it in the process, I can't even access the launcher now and after several attempts to fix I'm nowhere closer to being able to play it. The worst part of all this is that I have played over 2 hours before the update ruined everything so Steam will not refund me for this purchase. While I applaud Steams concept of a 2 hour refund on any game purchase what has happened here gets around that standard practice by the dev patching the game into a buggy and non working state after the fact.Don't give your money to this company, they have made no solid effort to fix the games problems and post the most generic of solutions on the forums which don't even fix the issue.

There is much to despair over multiplayer and this is very unfortunate.My reasons Extended Edition should not be bought:-Lag across the board in multiplayer, regardless of how beefy your computer is, online or LAN-God Powers can desync Online games and make it easy to abuse ranking-Conversion of old maps is made incredibly difficult due to the addition of some stupid 'Alfred' unit-There is no report button anywhere, so if you're getting trolled/bashed, you have to cope or stop playing online-Single Player shows it's problems in cutscenes. Wrong Angles or complete terrain obscurity.-HD simply means, you can't find the fish while trying to fish.

The Workshop grants great accessibility to Mods and the recent Updates, the Ranking system, the events and the loads of achievements guarantee long-term playability.The big question: Is it worth the money?If you enjoy real-time strategy and haven't played Age of Mythology before, I would highly recommend buying AoM:EE. It is THE classic real-time strategy game, which is, in my eyes, even better than Age of Empires and the EE with all its features is pretty cheap for a brand new strategy game for you, comparing it to other strategy games on the market.If you have already played AoM, I would not recommend buying it at its current price.

,Recommended,266840,19443233,"Posted: 2 December, 2015",all,<LDS> AngelHunter,"This is an honest review on Age of Mythology: Extended Edition.First off, a couple sentences about me so you know who this review is comming from.I started this game when I was 3 and my dad was playing it and he got me into it (it was escpecially fun because I am Greek and this helped me out in Mythology so when I went to 3rd grade in the Mythology class I literally knew everything even if some things arent 100% accurate to real mythology). I started the original version that came out in, I believe, 2001. Fast-forward a couple of years and I got theTitansversion of the game bringing a whole newfaction (I will get into factions later). I lost the game when my old 9 year old laptop broke and I got it back some time ago when it went on a steam sale for 7 Euros. If the non-steam versions of the game tracked my hours aswell, I would easily have more than 1500.The main idea of the gameThe game is anRTS(Real time strategy), you get to command your villagers to gather resources, make your town, your army and even your navy and fight to the death with your enemies!You can choose in between 5 factions (Greek, Egyptian, Norse, Atlantean and Chinese)Every faction has 3 different ""Main gods"" (ex. Greeks have Zeus, Poseidon and Hades)Every faction and main god has a few different upsides and downsides. (ex. Hades has very good archers)There are 4 types of resources used to upgrade units,buildings and much more,Wood, Food, Gold and Favor(Favor is used to create mythical units like Minotaurs or get some God-Specific upgrades)You can also advance to different ages if you have the right resources( Archaic -> Classic -> etc (I typed this because I dont remember the names lol)When advancing to a new age you can select some ""sub-gods"" like Aphrodite or Hermes which all give different upgrades and myth units (ex. Athena gives Minotaurs) and ofcourse a god-power that is 1-use on most factions (ex. Ares gives the ""pest"" power which is used on enemy ""unit-producing"" buildings will make them unable to produce units for a short time.Those were the gameplay basicsThe current state of the game/communityThe game was created in 2001 as I said before. It was pretty succesful and a very fun RTS game.A few years later the ""Titans"" update came out (I believe this was around 2006).The titans update added some cool new features and a whole new faction, the Atlanteans!And after that. The game basically died. The developers company disbanded and the game and community was left in avery bad spot. Then at 2014 ""Extended edition"" came out on steam. It had its upsides and downsides. The majority of the community sticked to titans. That remained this way until 2015 where a new update came out. It added the Chinese faction and a whole new campaign with like 15 levels.The campaign was overall bad and all the myth units/gods felt really rushed and overpowered. The new designs for some myth units were litteraly other myth units recolored with a dragon head which spitted fire that could destroy any building in like 2 seconds. Very overpowered and not fun.That was for the ""updates"" part of the game. Now we will talk about the community which is basically dead. If you are on the game you will see that there are only like 25 people online at all times so its nearly impossible to get an online game unless you like to wait for like 3 hours or can convince some of your friends to get this game.The ratingsGraphics:6.5 (For a very old game the graphics arent bad, but the bad graphics also have an upside of some sort since even lower end PC's can run it.)Campaign:8/10 (The campaign is amazing to say the least. Personally for me it gave me nostalgia after playing it again after 8 years but if you are an RTS player you will definetly like the campaign)Community:6/10 (The community at its current state isnt very good. The easiest way and probably the only way to play online currently is with friends,(The offline isnt very bad either tho, the bots especially on higher difficulties can  show a big challenge))Gamemodes:8/10 (I would have combined gamemodes with the community but AoM is the type of game that you can literally make anything out of, a few examples: Roleplay, Settlers, a map of litterally THE WHOLE WORLD YOU CAN PLAY ON and much more)OVERALL RATING FOR AOM:EE :7.5/10ConclusionIf you are an old player who played the titans version and possibly even the original you should give this game a try but maybe when its on a sale when its usually on 7 Euros.For new players seeing this game for the first time: If you are interested on this game you can read some more reviews or watch some youtube videos of it to get you to try it out, or if you have friends who are also interested in this game, get it on a sale if you have the money to spare and enjoy the game with your friends for guaranteed hours of fun!

The original developers really put a lot of thought into the economy, dynamics of civilizations, war play tactics, and ensuring that its consumers have the ability to run away with their imaginations in their map making sandbox.Many people tend to look over the small details that makes this game great, which is unfortunate.This game offers not only a  variety of extremely dynamic civilizations with varying god powers, strengths, and both passive/active procs such as priest that convert wild animals, buildings that when razed spawn militia, sky passages, andetc.But, it also provides great depth in the everyday game play.For example, ranged units generally have percent based accuricies that generally drop when against a moving target (which allows for great micro management in battles and a depth of skill and dynamic to warfare), cetain units have differents strengths and weaknesses, myth units come with a great varity of abilities that range from healing, to freezing, to acids spit, and the ability to eat trees or gold mines to heal oneself.There is also dynamic source of resources that vary with which the speed one can gather them and the amount they come in.And as I mentioned before, u have access to a map making sandboxes, and many players have created all types of scenerios such asSettlersZeldaNeo mutationBlood CastleRole Playing  MapsEscapeZonesand much more for different playing styles/modes.Now I have only touched the Iceburg, but I hope u get the chance to see the potential in the game, and the communities within it."

I never had the Titans expansion so that's why I bought this remake/Extended Edition/whatyouwannacallit. Visuals are great and music is still memorable. Campaign keeps you well occupied but the objectives are just repetitive sometimes. You usually start with a few villagers and your task is to destroy enemys camp. Repeat that and repeat it again. Still I keep coming back because the story is very good for a strategy game, as you could expect from AoE series. Maps in classic skirmish and campaign modes are also often very detailed and so it encourages you to scout every black spot to find hidden relics which can help you with your mission.The myth units bring a nice new twist to the old RTS formula but matches dont become a Minotaur spamfest as myth units are usually much more expensive than regular human units. Famous folklore heroes like Hercules and Achilles are also there and they take mythic beasts down like the bosses they are. Everything is pretty nice and balanced like a rock-paper-scissors game.Gods from old greek, egyptian and nordic mythologies play a major part in game. Every civilization has 3 main gods and they all have six minor gods who give you different kind of god powers like meteorite rain, ability to mind control monkeys or making your villages to gather food faster (lame!). A well used god power can turn a game upside down but they can be used only once so when and where to use them is critical.If you already own AoM and it's expansions don't bother buying this as theres very little new to offer for oldtimers. But if you don't have AoM what are you waiting for? This game is accessible for newcomers and offers a fair challenge for hardened strategy veterans. Buy it and love it!"

In this remade version... well I don't really see any changes from the original, except for stuff like Steam support, being able to run on modern OS', and the usual stuff you see when an old game is remade for the present day. All important, of course, but for those who have already played AoM, there isn't really anything new here.As usual, I stuck to single-player since I'm a terrible online RTS player. The main campaign here drags on a bit long, but it is still plenty good and worthy of the Age RTS series. The expansions' campaigns, which I had never played until now, were also pretty neat in their own way. I still prefer AoE II's campaigns, but... nothing really beats those in my book. I am biased. XDUltimately, it's just good old RTS fun, except this time you can literally storm your enemies with Hydras, Anubites, or Valkyries instead of the usual hordes of spearmen, archers, and cavalry.

The so called 'Extended edition', however, is a mess. The new chinese cultures bring nothing new to the game, and are completely bleak compared to the original three/four. The thing that bothers me the most, however, is the port itself. The extended edition was supposed to have improved graphics, but you can hardly spot it. The only thing that tweaks in the game's engine have caused is the unbelievable lag and stuttering even on machines that can run most of the contemporary games. Honestly, for a port of a 2002 game this is unacceptable. I haven't really tried to play the game online, but since the experience in the single player mode was already so cringy, I don't really expect the game to be playable online at all - I've read some of the other reviews, and apparently that's exactly the case. Overall, I'd only suggest you to buy the game if you find it on sale and just in case you cannot possibly find the original game anywhere. As said before, the graphical 'improvements' are barely noticable and the lag they cause ruins the whole experience. The chinese cultures don't bring anything significant to the game, so the game is definetely not worth the whole price."

While an old game now I still have fun jumping on it here and there and having a few games with friends of against the AI. For people who have yet to play this game, don't be put off by the mythological theme. This is still a great game that will give you the same satisfaction that you have gotten from the other titles.The campaign is fun and quite a lengthy investment. The expansion added campaign following the original is fantastic as well. You can live without the dwarves focused one, while it has some fun ideas for maps it's short, easy and lacks any real depth . The main problem I had with these in the newest steam version was that the graphical quality seems to have been dramatically reduced. I played the old version less than six months ago on a ten year old laptop and it looked better than this version on my new $3k rig.The day and night cycle is over rated and really serves no point, if anything I found it broke the game up more and turned it off.Multiplayer is fun but expect to play against strong players.Random AI matches are the same as before but with two new game types. They can be fun but I've always been a conquest or occasionally supremacy fan.Overall it's basically the same game that it was in the past. The steam community seems to have produced a nice array of new mods to enjoy and I've had fun revisiting this game once again. If you are considering repurchasing this game, wait for a sale and pick it up cheap, it's the same game. If you are looking at this game for the first time and enjoy similar games in the ""age of"" series you should enjoy this title and get your money's worth from it but it may seem a little dated at first. 7/10"

,Not Recommended,266840,19774109,"Posted: 18 December, 2015",all,Kerma,"EDIT: I literally just finished writing this review and then saw the RPS link that they're announcing a new expansion on chinese mythology. At the moment I still hold my stance on the game, But I will re-pick it up when the expansion comes out and change my review accordingly.As a long time fan of both Age of Empires and Age of Mythology, I'm going to say that unless you have an extreme attachment to Age of Mythology, go with the HD Remake of Age of Empires II for now. I'm writing this on the 2015/2016 christmas season, so maybe in the future this review will become outdated, but at the time of writing there is little support for this game compared to the other HD Remake of the same series.Firstly, Age of Empires has gotten 2 DLC packs that are both great. Expansions and improvements to a 15+ year old game. Rebalances and slight tweaks all the way to adding brand new techs to change the viability of certain kinds of play. I'm not expecting Age of Mythology to get anywhere near adding new expansions to the game as Age of Mythology is a much more advanced and complicated game with more going on, which takes quite a lot more time and materials to get it running- but the fact of the matter is that Age of Mythology EX hasn't gotten nearly any updates that mean anything since it has come out, in both gameplay aspects and technical aspects. Age of Empires II HD was extremely laggy in online and broken in multiple ways when it first came out, and so was Age of Mythology EX. The difference is that Age of Empires II HD actually fixed most of it's problems through patches, while Age of Mythology EX still chugs on some systems by managing to run worse than the original game even with lower graphical settings and online is still a buggy mess. There are apparently memory leaks within the game too, which make it slowly stutter as the game goes on, especially when the unit cap increases too.This isn't really an offensively bad port, otherwise. I can't really say I am downright angry with this upgrade to steam, actually I'm kind of glad it happened so I can at least play half of a match (before it randomly disconnects) with friends again without having to go through confusing game channels. The game is still the same as before, nothing awful has changed... If you don't like the Day/Night cycles you can turn them off as far as I remember, and the updated water gets turned back closer to what it was like in the original if you have you graphics turned down low enough (at least from my testing). Overall, I am still going to play this game and enjoy it, and if you're a huge fan of this game you will enjoy it too- but if you're just considering this or another Age of XXXX game, AoE2HD is a much, much better upgrade currently and will not eviscerate your system if you're running something mildly old."

Now, the key difference between this and the other ones is the size. Your army and base is in general smaller. There is also a focus on favor from the gods. This makes the game slightly unfair. See, Favor is a resource that every team obtain differently. Egyptians build statues, Greeks make people pray and the vikings must fight. So when everyone else can defend and build their base the vikings are have to diminish their army to be able to build a better one. I do love the vikings though and it does force some action upon the game. I just wish that, like in battle realms, this was forced upon all. There is also a clear favoring to the hero count on the Greek side. I know they are the ones with the most famous ones but why not take famous viking & Egyptian fighters? We could have people like red beard and blue tooth…. Shame.If you want a solid RTS with friends then this is definitely the one to play. There is also tons of mods for those who likes that. Ir you want a RTS to play alone I would tell you to look at more options. This is good against AI too but the other “age of” games are better for that I think.If you wonder about the extended part then all I can say is: It's more. Also the titans are NOT that fun but gives variation.PS: Doesn't work on LINUX.  :("

Even though the graphics look old, outdated and haven't been improved much at all, the game is ok to play.I find the game mostly enjoyable to play even though it is an ugly game with graphics from 2000. And with AOM  Extended Edition, doesn't seem like much  has been added or changed/improved. It says improved graphics, but it doesn't look like it, all that seems to have improved is a bit of water texture, shadow and some lighting and it's still ugly old outdated textures.I like how there is a mythological aspect to the game, it makes it more interesting for me, to choose a god and have various powers you can evoke, though rather limited, powers such as call down a bolt of lightning to instant kill a enemy. And a devastating meteor that will destroy a small area. These powers are very limited though, only being able to use once per map, so should be used wisely.I also like that there are heroes and myth units, creatures like minotaurs and hydra that become stronger and grow another head after a kill.I get bored playing too much, usually after a couple of hours, as all it is, is fighting and nothing much else. And I feel happy when I complete a campaign scenario and then feel disapointed that there's another one to complete. So I probably don't like the campaign game much as it drags on and on.The campaign takes way too long to complete, usually I like lengthy games, but not when the story involved is rather boring and the scenario missions don't differ much as every one is mostly just build your base up, build army, attack and defeat. I just want it to hurry up and be over already. The campaign should be 15 to 20 scenarios at most, not 32. I prefer to play just random maps in short bursts.And it's frustrating when you get halfway through a scenario, only to have the game crash and you try and reload a recent save but the save file is stuffed and wont load so have to start the scenario from the begining again.I liked the game over all and say it's worth getting and playing at a discounted price for $10 or less, but not for full price as it's just an old rehashed game which has outdated graphics and not many improvements. Nothing that modernises or makes it feel worthy of the so called Extended title.6/10 ok."

I first played this one many years ago and still continue to play it today.If you played the AOE series or any other RTS on the market, then you know that formula is the same. You build up a town for resource collection, eventually building up defenses and finally an army to destroy the opposition, rinse and repeat. But wait, That's not all. Some missions give you an army and a goal in the very beginning where you must use only that army to overcome your obstacles. You also work with three different Mythologies. Greek, Egyptian, and Norse Mythologies are represented well. Once you reach the requirements to reach the next ""age"" you can choose between two specific gods and their powers to enhance your army or buildings.A very lengthy campaign will keep you busy for hours and the varied gameplay will keep you interested....recommended?

For those unfamiliar with the game, it is essentially a Real Time Strategy game, much like Age of Empires - but with heroes and mythical units too. While their are only four main factions to choose from (greek, egyptian, norse, atlanteans), each faction has numerous gods to choose from, and the diversity of not only the mythical units, but the standard human units as well, is impressive.The single player campaign is very well designed, with good level design throughout, and you will want to play it through more than once. While the Multiplayer is where the true fun lies, the single player is still worthy as a stand-alone game. Do not be afraid of trying out multiplayer though. Sure - there will be some very good people playing online, but do not be disheartened. Soon you will be (and I'm sure many of us have already experienced this) spending countless hours trying different game modes and developing new strategies to crush the heathan(s) opposing you. Also if you can get some mates together to play then all the merrier!Even though there appear to be some technical issues with the steam edition, let us just hope that they work out similar to those that were present in the Age of Empires Steam edition (which have since been fixed).If you have not experienced Age of Mythology, then I would whole-heartedly recommend it. If you have already played it then you may be a bit sceptical about handing out money for something you already own. What you are really paying for is the steam support for multiplayer. Finding games to play will be much simpler, because I can assure you that there will be a lot of people playing this game. A great game with an active and passionate community should not be simply passed by.9/10 would nostalgia again."

Therefore, it was only natural for me to want to get AoM:EE. However, if you don't have that nostalgia factor going for you, I'm not entirely sure that it's necessarily worth getting. It's not a bad game, and the campaigns alone will keep you busy for a while. Furthermore, the storyline, and thematic aspects of the game are pretty great. But despite these positive points, it's simply a very old RTS at this point, and as a result, its actual gameplay is simply not as good as what other games can offer nowadays.If, on the other hand, you also have the nostalgia factor going for you, then I would still hesitate before getting this. The DLC and patches only ruin the experience. Honestly, being unable to play the Chinese without paying (way too much for what you're getting) and then being matched up online against someone playing the Chinese is downright ridiculous.tl;drI loved AoM when I was younger. But I honestly don't think it's worth it at full price, considering what you're getting. I don't regret buying it, but I also wouldn't recommend it for most people."

The units have the worst pathfinding across maps that I've seen in 30 years of gaming, frequently getting caught on hillsides, in trees, or against walls. I seem to spend 20% of my time unhooking trade carts from blades of grass that are apparently insurmountable objects in this version. I'm truly stunned that the game was released in this state.Another utterly infuriating change that has made the game considerably worse - once teams have surrendered, their units, including Titans, will continue not only to attack you, but to chase you all over the map! If you're out, you should cease to have ANY role in the game. The game should delete all units and offensive buildings to free up RAM and processor resources and should get lost! I don't expect defeated players to continue obstructing me!Add to that, occasional crashes as the game becomes too busy, and multiplayer file sizes that I still find incredible, and you could think that this game is not worth buying and at full price you'd be absolutely right. I bought it in the sale for under £10 and I guess it's not so bad for that price.Positives? New races, new missions, great new map types, decent network and online support with a surprisingly large and active community, and the fact that the game exists at all in 2017, let alone on steam with new graphics.This is my favourite of the Age series, and it's as enjoyable as I remember, with epic 2-4 hour games passing in the blink of an eye! It's much more frustrating thanks to all the new flaws. Nevertheless, this is in some ways an advance over the Microsoft version, albeit a horrifically flawed and bugged version.Love the game, hate the lazy programming. No way I can give this an honest thumbs up. I'm sure nostalgia has earned many of its good reviews, whilst others were written before people discovered its many major shortfalls."

I loved the game as a child and the gameplay hasn't really changed much, even if you include the Steam expansions to it.

I can't praise this game enough and I am truly grateful that I can play this game without any issues or hiccups as well as having a fresh aspect in achievment which make you want to play even more and adds even more replay value to this already extraordinary game. I highly recommend, especially if you're a fan of Age of Empires II. Rise of nations is also a game that comes to mind although the mechanics are different. This game is much more like Age of Empires II."

Having never played AoM way back when, I decided to try it out when the HD pack released due to my enjoyment of the HD AoEII. Four unique and interesting armies all four of which having a variety of strengths and weaknesses. All I can say is Atlantean Master Race, as nothing is better then warping around a house for 80 wood every 90 seconds and annoying your allies on Skype.Unlike the AoEII HD pack, AoM HD holds up against even modern RTSes, with far better unit control and AI. However it still does come up a tad short in a variety of ways. Still and enjoyable game over all, but nothing to write home about though it may have been back in the day.Overall Rating: 8/10."

Well, that's where Age of Mythology comes in.One has to admit that 9 out of 10 purchases of this Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is made purely for nostalgic reasons. Most buyers remember this game from the past, or from their childhood, and are glad it's got a reboot, escpecially after Microsoft completely removed the ESO (online Multiplayer) support for Age of Mythology, making the game only playable through LAN and VPNs. For those people it's more than obvious that the game's a viable purchase.Mind that Age of Mythology is highly educational. It's an RTS that uses 4 different kinds of mythological cultures as factions to fight each other. You can choose Norse, Greek, Egyptian and ""Atlantean"" gods to worship, in which the atlanteans tend to worship Greek titans rather than gods. The upgrades, units, myth creatures and buildings are extremely and surprisingly accurate to what is described in their respective mythologies, and the game even has a built-in encyclopedia full of lore behind each entity and upgrade within the game. Before actually having proper mythological history classes, Age of Mythology was my base mythological knowledge and by the dragons, it gave me a huge advantage. Age of Mythology is definitely an entertaining way to learn about ancient culture and old religions.Are you looking for something shiny and revolutionary? Look elsewhere. This game is quite old and despite the updates, it hasn't got the fancy graphics and mechanics you'd get in strategy games nowadays. Are you into retro-ish games with stable mechanics and decent online gameplay? Yes, this will work out fine.There's some issues I have with this game, though. First of all, the game is expensive, considering that the only real addition to the classic game that is truly significant is the reboot of the online game mode. The game has the same old bugs and the game's connection online is worse than it's been in the old days. But... I guess it works, which is quite an improvement. The issue is more or less that it is very much questionable whether matches of the day, online support, achievements and minor tweaks (which are mostly imported scripts that one could've just downloaded from AoM Heaven or whatever Age of Mythology fan website) such as changing of seasons and ""updated graphics"" (which are barely notable) are actually worth the money.If you're extremely interested in and devoted to the comeback of random PvP online gameplay within Age of Mythology, then yes, consider getting this. If you're up for amazing new features and fixes to the game other than ranked online modes, I do NOT recommend this, for the new features are barely notable and not worth your money.Why do I recommend this game? Because I'm rating Age of Mythology here, and not the extended edition per se. The game is not bad, the game is actually quite fantastic. It's the extended edition updates that's just not worth the effort in my opinion.In conclusion, Age of Mythology is an all-time classic and must-have for those who enjoyed Age of Empires and other relatively old RTS games. The rules of thumb for purchasing this game are:- IF you're extremely interested in random PvP online Age of Mythology gaming, buy the extended edition. Note that the connection is bad and you will experience a lot of lag.- IF you are a fan of Age of Mythology and want to support the reboot, regardless of the additions being underwhelming, buy the extended edition.- IF you're here for revolutionary RTS experiences and shiny new mechanics, move along.- IF you're not interested in history and mythology, move along.- IF you don't care about the online mode and/or find the additions not impressive, get an old copy of Age of Mythology + the Titans expansion at your game store or online. You can get these old copies for about $2 and they run perfectly fine on ANY XP or higher Windows OS without trouble, and the LAN feature will work fine, so if you want to play with some known friends you can just use a VPN client like Hamachi or Evolve."

This iconic game was fun many, many years ago and is still fun today, with this HD remake in Steam and intergrated Twitch support. The only single thing I did not like about this game, is that the AI can be frustrating at times, but that is to be expected from an old game and definitely not something that warrants missing out on this grand RTS experience. I've also heard many people say this remake introduced new problems to the game, such as increased lag and a higher probability of timing out in a multiplayer match, but I myself did not run into said problems and I'm sure they will be patched, if they hadn't been already.Also, Tale of the Dragon, a new expansion now available and made just for this HD remake, brings Chinese gods, mythology and civilizations to the mix, which were tested closely and extensively by players and fans of the series to make sure everything was balanced as best as possible.Do you like RTS?

It's gotten so much publicity that it's even got a new expansion coming out after over a decade of silence.From the same minds that produced Age of Empires, Age of Mythology puts you in charge of ancient warriors and pantheons in a struggle to conquer the map. Gather food, wood, gold and Favor from your Gods in order to expand, conquer and acquire. New to the format are Myth Units and God Powers: use your accumulated favor to obtain unique improvements and powerful creatures from legends. Call upon your Gods to create food from nothing, plagues of locusts or rain fire from the skies on your enemies.In the game's 13 years of existence, it has seen 2 expansions: The Titans, and more recently Tale of the Dragon. The Extended Edition comes with The Titans expansion, which grants access to the Atlantean Civilization, an offshoot of the Greeks who have been abandoned by the traditional Gods and choose to worship the precursors to the Olympians, the Titans. As well, the Extended Edition has new online support, allowing you to play games with people from across the world and upload to Twitch immediately."

The story has a verygood plot, with indepth detail and historical references (Helen of Troy.)- Steam Workshop added (I know hardcore fans prefererd AoM heaven over Steam Workshop, however I much prefer the ease of Steam Workshop)-Multiplayer battles with friends-Wide Screen HD (Finally)-It is on steam (No more remembering that 16 digit code on the instruction booklet you were fairly sure you threw away.)Negatives:- Online battles agaisnt strangers, and rankings (This is one of the most BROKEN online multiplayer I have ever seen. The online games will disconnect whenever they feel. The rankings can just loose data every now and then for no apparent reason.)- Over a year of no bug patches (Fix the online system!)-The Price. This is a big one, now I bought this on sale for £6.99, which is an acceptable price, but at full price for £23?! It is too much (Note you can buy an Old Disk copy of AoM for about £2-£6 online.) I would be happy to pay that much if there was a constant dev team adding and fixing content, but for a simple bog standard re-release, it is too much.-Loading times. I remember the Titans Expansion pack had long loading times, but some of the campaign loading times are ridiculous.Overall I would reccomend this game for anybody who wants to feel the nostalgia of the game, but ONLY when it goes on sale. The game at full price is not worth the money, but at sale I could say it is well worth it. The campaigns story is very good in itself, but if you finish the story line you can always turn to mods."

So going back to it after all these years would be great right?Well...no. Unfortunately the game hasn't aged all that well. At all. Gameplay is far slower and clunkier than I remember it being, which is strange since it feels slower than Age of Empires 2 (Which has aged far better than this game).The graphics arn't stylistic enough to still look good, it looks more like Nintendo 64 level than anything that was the standard at the time. While the environments and buildings tend to look pretty good, the units just look fairly lackluster. Gameplay is just so god damned slowed, even the battles feel so slow and clunky you would think you were running it at the slowest speed possible. In concept units all have counters for one another, some units are better are killing certain units than others, but unless you're an expert at micromanaging in practice it just proves completely worthless.Even when I tried micromanaging my units according to their counters, combat was still slower than molasses and just felt overall unsatisfying. Defenses feel almost worthless in this game as well, no matter how well constructed your base defenses are simple infantry can just break through it in no time. The myth units are still overpowered as ever, even if you counter them with heroes.Also the new expansion doesn't add anything particularly worthwhile. The idea is awesome! Ancient chinese units and myths all integrated into a new faction! In practice, it's nothing special at all. It feels like Greek-Lite more than anything. The campaign it adds is just so bland and uninteresting as well. Speaking of, the main campaign of the story is bland and uninteresting overall, with only a few levels that really rise up to being great (Arkantos' Dream being the most prominent). All of it boils down to ""Build up base, take down X."" with very little variation or story bits in the middle.While this would normally be nothing to really complain about (since that's the core of an RTS afterall), the slow and uninteresting gameplay piled on top of that makes the Campaign feel like a complete and utter grind.The concept is still fantastic, but in practice it's really just not all that great a game. I've went back and played quite a few older RTS' and sadly AOM just doesn't hold up like its brothers and sisters of the time. I loved this game once, but going back and playing it? I can't really remember why I loved it."

Buy it if it's on sale. have to say it's worth the 7 dollars i payed.If you havent played these games yet and this one caught your eye, keep a few things in mind. The campaign really isn't anything spectacular, and it lacks the depth that many other RTS have that are available for a competitive price. There's no real negotiating trades or territories or treaties. Diplomacy is clicking to go to war.Nation-building is insanely straightforward. Laborers gather each supply, and theres very few to keep track of. Food, gold, wood, favor, population. You dont have to keep them happy or worry about maintaining them (save from your enemies wrathful armies)Combat isn't anything flashy, little units slash at eachother. There are a few little tactical things you can make them do but nothing compared to some of the other RTS games you might have played.Tl;drFun and simple RTS for all skill groups, great mythology and skirmish play. Campaign lacks luster and the ""Extended Edition"" just feels like Titans with added teasers for the Dragon Expansion. Worth a couple bucks if it's on sale(I got mine for seven dollars and that seems like a fair price).BoogaBooga."

There is also still a bug present that allows you to build a Wonder in one of the campaign missions, even though youre not supposed to be able to do that.From what I have read, the ""dev team"" behind this ""update"" is just a bunch of modders that asked Microsoft for permission to work on the game.

And that's exactly why you should wait a bit(or in the case of AoEII HD, two to three months) until they get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together.AoM at its core is a fantastic game. Featuring stunning music, a unique artstyle, campaigns that are long and don't get old, unique and fun factions. The problem with the extended edition, is that it hardly adds any content. Which should be expected if you were aware of AoEII HD. This extended edition just adds some neat effects like a night and day cycle, ehanced lighting, and other graphical effects while including the base game, some downloadable content, and the expansion.Yet this extended edition feels lazy. AoEII HD was, you know, HD. It had updated sprites and all for the game. Giving it a clean look with a HUD that doesn't take up 25% of your screen. AoM EE doesn't even feature improved graphics. All the models are exactly the same from the base game, they look good as long as you don't zoom in; if you zoom in even slightly, your eyes get overloaded by pixels.One of AoM's main problems is the lack of maps or truly randomized maps. The maps are fun in themselves, yet frequently give a feel of ""you've played one, you played them all"". The developers could of easily added in a few maps, yet didn't.When AoM the Titans came around, one of the biggest problems is that you couldn't turn off Titans. Each faction gets a titan, which if you reach that far into the game, completely destroys all forms of logic and tactics. The Titan is, as the name suggests, OP as♥♥♥♥♥♥ When you get a good game going, it'll eventually become a Titan rush. Limiting truly interesting and long games. AoM EE still doesn't fix this issue since the Titan expansion pack is automatically apart of the package.I don't know what the hell they did with the options. Half the graphics options feel completely useless. The game has some bad jaggies, and turning on FXAA does nothing.Just like AoEII HD, multiplayer is completely ♥♥♥♥ed until we get some patches along the line. Everyone lags like hell, the host will be the only one doing anything resembling playing a game. Multiplayer is completely unplayable.But hey, who cares about the multiplayer right? AoM has one of the best campaigns in an RTS. Don't worry though, the patch they brought up on today, completely screwed up the game for many. The game now freezes every three seconds, making the game unplayable for both by yourself and with your friends.On release, the game had some issues. Random FPS drops, turning on FXAA makes everything look like mud and the water became horribly pixelly. But is was completely playable and enjoyable, now with this new patch, the game has become unplayable for quite a lot of people including myself.The game has some stupid launcher that is directly linked to showing AoM tweets. When a game is available on Steam, and steam only, developed entirely for steamworks; a game shouldn't have a stupid launcher like this.There's also this strange new art that they keep shoving in your face. Not the original art from the original team, this brand new art that looks bad and completely pales in comparsion.They removed the awesome intro videos of the original game instead just shoving developer splash screens.Main menu is stuck on the Titans theme instead of cycling between the original AoM theme and the Titans theme.tl;dr AoM EE at its core is a fantastic game. I myself bought the game just because I love AoM. I half expected the multiplayer to be ♥♥♥♥ed, I didn't mind. I didn't expect the entire game to be ♥♥♥♥ed because of some horrible patch choices.Wait until the summer sale, check up to see if the game has been fixed."

For instance, with my favorite faction, the norse break from the standard rts as the basic fighters for the norse are also the one building the structures.The great feature of this game is to select the faction then in game pick the gods from your pantheon you want to follow, each on having different traits. This way you can select which gameplay to follow by selecting an upgrade path every ages (or level  1-4) that will give you specific troops and powers.AI games are good to try the combinations and will keep you playing for many hours.

Now, I am one of the fortunate people that didn't encounter any problems launching or playing the game. There are multiple issues I have with this game.The first issue isn't really game breaking, its just notable FPS drops in multiplayer. While internet connections between players no doubt is an important factor in this, but like many others who are experiencing it (Development team admitted this is an issue with coding in the patch notes), its not only the internet connections that is casuing the issue, like I said, its not game breaking.The second problem certianly is game breaking for me, it's the poor or almost non-existent ""Attack Move"" button in this game. I have played many other RTS games, I have never seen such a badly implemented ""Attack Move"" function in an RTS game. It happened to me and my friend multiple times, if you use the ""Attack Move"" function, the units would often ignore all the enemy/hostile units in the way, the units would not attack untill they reach the location or being stopped in the pathway. That is not how an ""Attack Move"" function should work. I believe this is also to do with the poor pathfinding in this game. Units would often get stuck between various objects in the map (Trees, mines, buildings, etc.).The third problem, while this is a minor one, but it is still noticable and affect the gaming experience. There are certain areas on the maps that you cannot build buildings on, again,  it's another bug, it gets rather frustrating when you are trying to build a wall, but the game won't allow you.To have more of an idea the number of issues this game current has, please check out AoM:EE Issues for the Competitive Community by DragonQ. It has highlighted many other issues I didn't address in this review. I don't think this game deserves the 30 dollar price tag at its current state. I welcome these ""HD Editions"" or ""Extended Editions"" of classic RTS games, only if it is done properly."

The graphics are almost the same as the original which is from 2002 and yet it cannot run on lower end computers. If you want to see what the graphics look like, just go to google images and you will see why it should be able to run on almost any computer that's less than 12 years old. What is even worse though, is the lag you get while playing online. I played this with my brother several weeks ago, we were on the same network, and the lag is unbearable. It was unplayable. I got this game for my 13th birthday in 2014, I was extremely excited, but then I found out my dads computer couldn't even run it because it's so badly optimized. Now three years later, I have a good computer and I can't play it online because the lag is so bad. Our internet is 60 megabits a second, it's pretty good, however, the game is unplayable online. So unless you're using the fastest internet in the world, I think you're going to have problems. This game has been out for three years, they've had time to fix it, yet they haven't and I doubt they every will. If you want to play age of mythology, you should just stick with the old one or if you don't have it, buy it on amazon for 10 dollars. This game is so broken and such a dissapointment. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT, buy this game. You will regret it."

I didn't complain right away because it wasn't terrible and the basics still worked which is good enough to kill some free time. But it got worse with performance, it became incompatible with mods and crashed even without mods more often, and it just got worse with every update. At this point I would just recommend you go buy the disc version for 10$ or less because this game is now♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't even play it anymore and when it does load, the text won't load so all there are is a menu with empty buttons.

Major can impact everything from your units, your god powers and your economy. For example, the Norse have 3 major gods: Loki, Thor and Odin. Loki focuses more on military, Thor focuses more on economy and technology, and Odin is a balance of both.

What's more, day and night cycles actually changed the shadow effects and lighting. All good and, to be honest is expected from a re-release...Steam Multiplayer, get in!

The new graphics and multiplayer are pretty good and the new day/night cycle is fun.Now what if you buy this expansion and you dont have the chinese expansion and you want to play multiplayer. Holy @@@@ wtf. The matches are found really quickly and are fun to play against the old civs. THE OLD CIVS. I wont talk about the chinese campaign because other people already destroyed it so lets talk about the new civ :If you play against the chinese and you have one of the old civ, you will get destroyed no matter how good you are. ALL of the new myth units are completely overpowered at a level where a ragnarok army will lose to pure chinese myth units. They dont cost enough money and can be produced at an stupidly fast rate. im not saying their design is bad or they are unimaginative, i actually think they are pretty cool. They are just @@@@@@ up.Alright, now the myth units are out of the way... lets talk about their stupidly overpowered (wow again) human soldiers. The archers, cavalry and infantry are mostly re-skins. the only cool soldiers are the general which is basically arkantos but comes at a great price and their foot soldier siege units, which fire from too far away and deal too much damage. The heroes are cool except the priests shouldnt be able to hit because converting units is already pretty op considering they are the only civ to be able to do it.Their economy you say? overpowered, again. Their gardens , which generate ressources out of nothing are too cheap, produce too fast and the Chinese players can build too many of them. This makes the chinese economy completely unbeatable and unfair to play against.To conclude, this game remains fun and the multiplayer could be better ( although the developpers say that leagues and ""badges"" will come soon which is nice). Everything in this game seems nice until it comes to the Chinese where everything almost needs to be fixed. I still recommend this game even though there are so many necessary fixes a whole 300 pages book would not be enough to describe them. It feels as if there wasn't much love when making the game than age of empires 2 for exemple, which has seen excellent expansions and isnt overflowing with bugs.Sad pepe is sad"

All these people are, in their own words, 'long time age of mythology fan' and they all say you should just buy the original instead. As someone who's played both games then and now, I 100% disagree.WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS EXTENDED EDITION INSTEAD OF THE OLD ONE- The old version DOES NOT WORK on modern PC""s. And if you do get it to work, expect it to work poorly.- Fans of the original might love their old graphics, but they simply don't look good in this day and age. People who say the HD remake is no huge difference are terrible liars as the screenshots already show the difference, and the sole reason of being able to play this widesceen properly already makes it superior. And that's not even counting the improvements in animation! (Water looks fantastic)- If you really want to go multiplayer, good luck because the old game has no casual or new players, just riddled with pro veterans who do nothing but the same tactics over and over again. ""GG NO RE"" It's the reason why I don't care for multiplayer in my RTS's anymore; because it's pointless.- Steam mod support is fantastic and has a lot of potential to grow for this extended edition.So buy this game! If you love single-player RTS then there is definetly everything you want to find here. People's complaints about multiplayer might be valid but the rest is total purist horsedung. It looks great. It plays great. I haven't had a single crash and the achievements are fun to get. The story mode is interesting and it's a bunch of fun trying out all the different Gods and their followers.It's not perfect and has some flaws and quirks that can annoy you more then me, but this is overall a good game for someone who's never played AoM before."

76561198082895965,Recommended,266840,28607790,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,RhastaSenpai,"Disclaimer: Bought the game along with the DLC, and no launch problems whatsoever, not even on multiplayer, the only problems I had was with the game itself having bugs, but never game crashing bugs.Been an Age of Mythology fan for years on, when I saw this game on steam, with ""enhanced graphics"" and all, I was really excited to buy it, and relive the memories I had when I was a little kid, playing this amazing game, it is a shame that the original developer studios Ensemble, have disbanded a long time ago, with that in mind, we can see that this version is made by another studio, on top of the work of the previous developers, the graphics are neat (with some exceptions in models and textures), as well as some minor improvements over the gameplay, but I can see now, as playing the dlc as well, that this was rushed, or if not rushed, this was a lazy attempt to make a remastered edition, the campaign from ""Tale of the Dragon"" doesn't have the magic the original campaigns had, the chinese units are cool, and the lore is okay, but the campaign has bugs, as well as poor writing also the plot at times looses its meaning, (and somehow the main campaigns have presented bugs that oiriginally weren't in the original game). Looking at the perspective of the dlc single player campaign: Doesn't live up to the legacy the original Game and The Titans expansion; even the Golden Gift campaign left. Not by one bit, if you want to buy it, wait for a sale, I did that, and for less than 9$ this is worth it, the multiplayer community is not very active, but there is people to play with.The multiplayer experience is quite different, and I gotta say playing as the Chinese, is really fun, the new maps, and remastered maps look amazing, and gladly the multiplayer doesn't have bugs that sometimes get to gamebreaking levels, the civilizations are well balanced, and as an rts this game stands great at with, with opportunities for different playstyles and strategic decisions that make a match challenging and fun. This remastered edition is okay at best, as some added features thanks to steam, it has something charming that could be amazing if it was implemented in the right way. With nothing more to say, for nostalgic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that probably learned more about mythology with this game than all those years in school like myself, you should probably get this.Long live the ""Age of"" games!"

76561198071689614,Not Recommended,266840,16516387,"Posted: 18 June, 2015",all,Mystic Exarch,"The main problem with this game is that the enemy AI is poorly coded. They're not fun to play against because they build up tons of defense and an army. But they don't ever leave their base with their army. They use it to defend while they build a wonder. Once you build a wonder, you win the game in 10 minutes. So the AI strategy is to just rush a wonder while defending.Also there is a system in which you have 4 ages. Each age is comparable to a tier in other RTS games...it unlocks new technology and units. The way the game is balanced, advancing your ages faster is a massive advantage. So therefore the game is a rush to the final age and then the game actually starts for real.You can't really be agressive in this game because your army will get stomped by you opponent's towers and base, which have arrow attacks. You need siege weapons to damage buildings, but you don't get them until later on.So the gameplay basically becomes, focus on economy and building up resources for an hour while advancing through the ages as fast as you can. Rush a wonder, or build up an epic army and have one battle at the end of the game. It's very repetitive and doesn't inspire creativity, which is something integral to the RPG genre.Also this game is missing a HUGE feature. The ""a move"". Without it it's a huge pain to manage your units.This is compunded by the fact that the units are so tiny and there are oftentimes hundreds on the screen at once. I simply can't tell what's going on or if I am winning or not. You have to order your men to attack one unit at atime, which messes everything up because they get all gummed up trying to attack the same unit. But there's really nothing else you can do.I bought this game for real cheap on the summer sale. I can't reccomend it for the full price, though, which is why it gets a downvote."
,Not Recommended,266840,16455537,"Posted: 16 June, 2015",all,Blood Tears,"Age of Mythology. My childhood. The first RTS I ever played, and one of the first video games I sunk hours of my life into. This was a great game! But chancces are, if you're reading this review, you do not have nostalgia to fall back on. For me, seeing this game on sale was a no-brainer - I had to get it and replay it and recapture the magic.So after about 11 years, what is my impression? Well... if you've already played this game, and love it, go for it. But it definitely doesn't stand the test of time, for me. What was fun and groundbreaking and challenging 11 years ago has been repeated many times since in better games. So rather than posting a tired meme or ""PROSTAGOMA 10/10 LOL,"" here is a list of pros and cons for those who have never tried the game and actually want something substiantial to go on.Pros:*One of the only RTSes out there with a focus on ancient culture and the mythology that surrounds them. While other RTSes focus on realism or space exploration, AOM treats the myths of the acient Greeks, the Egyptians, the Norse, and the Atlanteans as if they were real. As a teenager playing this game, I learned a lot about these ancient cultures from this game. Oh, and there's the Atlanteans, because yeah.*Campaign does a decent job of going through all the civilizations and leading you on an adventure.* Mythical creatues will fight for you and destroy things.*God powers will destroy things.Cons:*Even remastered, the graphics are still not great. Which is fine, because it's old.* There are only four different cultures to play as. This is in opposition to pretty much every other RTS I've played, which have 10 at a minimum. It gets pretty boring after a while having to play the same cultures over and over. It would have been nice to add some from Asian or South America - there are tons of options they could have gone with.* It's honestly a step down from Age of Empires 2. It's like it took all the features in that game, and then cut out a bunch of stuff from each feature and then dumbed it down. Fewer cultures, fewer types of buildings, limits on how many buildings you can build so that your camps all end up looking the same. Even the maps are much more boring with less varied terrain. You can't convert enemy units or buildings, your farms stay there forever (which grantes is less annoying, but it still feels dumbed down). Fishing boats stay in place forever as well.* Because of this, there just isn't a lot to do. AI operates in the same way every time, there are only a few different buildings to build or units to create. Since you don't have a lot to build, every city looks the same.* Which is why most people used to focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game. Unfortunately, well, it's been 12 years. Everyone moved on. You can find better multiplayer communities elsewhere.* The campaign is, well, tedious. Rather than focusing on history, they focus on a bunch of stupid characters who barely have a personality. You don't really get a lot of time to build up encampments, and when you do it all goes away moving on to the next campaign, when you've suddenly forgotten all of the technology you learned.* Arkantos' piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥son. I hate that kid. He was the first video game character I ever wanted to see die.Anyway, if you like RTS games, there are a lot better ones you can buy. Age of Empires 2 came out 4 years before this one and yet still has more features. I haven't gotten to AoE III yet, but I'm guessing that would be even better. And this isn't counting the games like Civilization whose complexity blows this game out of the water. Basically, if you think that Age of Empires is just way too difficult and complicated, give this one a try. But having things to do is what makes these games fun. If you played this 12 years ago and are feeling nostalgic or just want to yell at Arkantos's son one more time, go for it. But I don't recommend it for new players."

,Recommended,266840,28687862,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Aritude,"This is largely the same game you might remember from 2002. However, the Extended Edition and the Tale of the Dragon (Chinese) DLC does add a few new things into the mix.AoM is a game that my friends and I have never really stopped playing. It strikes a sweet spot for multiplayer games, and the original and Titans campaigns are quite masterfully crafted, telling a story that weaves together the mythologies of three very different civilizations. The Chinese campaign is noticeably lower quality, reusing textures and models from other civs instead of using its own. In some places one can ""cheat"" the Chinese campaign AI due to blatant programming oversights. I encountered several AI glitches in the final scenario wherein many enemy units were unresponsive and would just stand there to be obliterated. Nevertheless, it is a fun addition to a very old game.On the multiplayer side, network issues are common, but not as crippling as they were with the original game. In the event that a player is disconnected, the game can usually be saved and reloaded from the same point at which the connection was interrupted. The Tale of the Dragon DLC injects a new life into the multiplayer experience, revitalizing an old game by offering opportunites for new strategies.If you have a group of friends (or even just one friend) who would play with you, this game is a great investment that you'll be coming back to for years to come. It's not perfect, but it is a unique experience that nothing else comes close to."

,Recommended,266840,14413266,"Posted: 9 February, 2015",all,[BrB] Comrade!,"While their previous titles, Age of Empires I and II, focused on history, Ensemble Studios opted to create a fantastical setting where three factions, the Norse, Ancient Egyptians, and Ancient Greeks collided. Player factions were further divided into three major deities, such as Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades for Greece. Following the footsteps of Starcraft, the three factions were asymmetrical in their playstyles, with the Norse favoring aggressive strategies, the Egyptians favoring late-game power, and the Greeks being middle-of-the-road. Technology paths were further divided by players choosing between two sub-deities at each level of the tech tree. Players could still train historical units like hoplites and pharaohs, but these would be alongside such mythical beasts as chimeras and valkyries. They could even evoke ""God powers,"" with some bringing economic or combat support advantages, while others such as meteor strikes or earthquakes functioning as the game's version of the superweapons of RTS titles from the Command and Conquer series.Like many classic RTS titles, Age of Mythology features multiplayer and singleplayer skirmish modes with various rules as well as a full campaign, which follows the saga of the Atlantean hero, Arkantos. The campaign is actually quite good for an RTS, serving as both tutorial for players as well as providing a classic story of good vs evil, with many familiar figures from all three mythologies along the way. Multiplayer can be done vs other players or even AIs. The Extended Edition also includes content from the original game's Titans expansion, including a 4th faction, the Atlanteans, as well as the campaign. Most importantly a new mechanic, the Titans was introduced for all 4 factions, essentially each faction to construct a super-unit (the eponymous titan) capable of massive destruction.Age of Mythology first came about in the early aughts, alongside such RTS classics as Warcraft III (yes, Warcraft was not always a MMORPG!) and and Rise of Nations. While many later RTS titles would opt for ""real-time tactics"" gameplay as pioneered by the likes of Relic Entertainment's Dawn of War and Company of Heroes titles and Eugen Studios' ""Wargame"" series, Age of Mythology stands as a reminder of the classic RTS formula of ""harvest / build / destroy."""

,Recommended,266840,14962530,"Posted: 19 March, 2015",all,Griffon Tempest,"Age of Mythology has always been one of - no, definitely my favourite game of all time. The campaign, though dull at times with storytelling, always had a great feel to it. Yes, sometimes, there were some things left unexplained, but it was still a good campaign. But where the game stood out was the Random Map gamemode - the game would generate a random map seed every time you played, so every time it was a little different. You could have massive free for all games involving 12 people fighting for their survival, or have a good old fashion 2v2 team battle (My personal preference).Unfortunately, I lost the disc for the Titans Expansion a while back, and have been unable to play with Titans... until now!Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is a great remake of the original AoM, with only very few differences:- Updated Graphics- A new campaign- A new multiplayer service (The original AoM lost multiplayer in 2012 I believe)- A few new random map selections (I think, they may have been in the Titans version though).- A new ""Treaty"" gamemode, and new AI types.But, what they didn't change was the gameplay, which was definitely the best part of the original game. And that means a lot to someone who loved AoM, because now, I can play on steam with my friends in the same way I would play alone against the computers.I'd say this game only has a few flaws:- Campaign can be dull at times- I often experience a lag spike for the first 5 seconds or so after starting a game.- A note on that, my CPU is 2.7 GHz dual core, and my GPU is the AMD Radeon HD 7520G (Not a very good graphics card)- Often in team games of random map, the enemy computers will gang up and want to destroy you right off the bat (Not that this wouldn't happen in a real game, but it seems it happens in Random Map games more often than not).- And, of course, its pricetag. At $30, it's a bit pricey, but still worth it in my opinion.Honestly, if this game ever goes on sale for any discount greater than 10%, get it, it's amazing for any RTS or Mythology lover."

Why aren't the Celts, or Native Americans, or Eastern European mythologies in the game?

The main reason I prefer it to the other ensemble RTS Age games (and I've played them all) is the autoque feature for automatically building villagers at the TC. I dont want to have to remember every 60 seconds or whatever it is to select the TC and create another villager. I dont have the type of brain that is able to remember to do that. As such, I am able to remain competitive in this game moreso than the other games, and thusly have more fun online because I have a chance of winning at least.I also bought five copies of this during a sale and gave them to my friends and we had a BLAST relearning and playing this game together, until the players eventually fell apart due to personal issues (not related to the game). The people online might be a bit too skilled, so you might want to consider rounding up some friends to play, if you can do that you'll have lots of fun and its well worth the time and effort for everyone to learn it. (Offer to give your friends free copies of the game via steams gifting system in exchange for their promise to learn and play the game with you).Im really looking forward to the expansion that is rumored to be in development too!!! There really is no game that can match this in terms of multiplayer replay value, and there are still plenty of strategy guides left over from 10 years ago, all of which are still valid (thank  goodness) because the game balance was wisely left untouched by the people who brought this game to steam."

This game has a special place in my heart for it was one of a few games that I could play with all three of my brothers. It has classic graphics that were redone pretty well in the remaster. The gameplay mechanics are as amazing as I remember and I love the different maps that you can play. The online mode is pretty underwhelming the last time I played this game, but I played the game in it's peak where you would find well over 1000 matches and maps going on at a time. I would highly suggest this game to those looking for a RTS and love Greek Mythology."

All cultures seem to be fairly well balanced when it comes to gameplay.  I have played this game when it came out and am really pleased to see Steam greenlight this project.  If you don't know much about mythology, it has plenty of information to read when it comes to learning about the ancient beliefs and the units you play.  I rank this above all the Age of Empires for its gameplay mostly, and not just a fondness of mythology.  Good luck, have fun."

,Recommended,266840,20986881,"Posted: 5 February, 2016",all,Elk479,"Troubled sleep,This is a game that I always come back to, time and time again. In fact, besides age of empires gold edition this was my first game I ever owned on a PC. I could not get enough of this game back in the day. I clocked soo many hours into it the timer would say ""damn"" Now before I go into detail on why I should reccomend this game I should talk about the problems I ran into1. The visuals.Maybe it is just me but the new grass textures just destroys my eyes. I actually got a headache playing my first match on Islands. The textures are not bad but they seem too grainy but hey its age of mythology.2. GlitchesI ran into this problem alot trying to face multiple enemies one would not even appear on the map and the other would just sit there and do literally nothing. Also, I ran into problems with icons for certain units not appearing for instance the anti-foreign soldiers of egyptians would just be a blank icon.3. DLC glitchesthis is only for the people that bought the game and not its expansion alot of times when trying to load a random map with a random enemy for some reason the dlc somehow glitches itself into the game crashing it and forcing me back to the main menu....4. Sill has that AI jumpThis is a problem for alot of beginners, when you first play on aom its more than likely on easy and the enemy will basically stand stil until very late in the game, well lets play moderate and you are chugging along and all of a sudden at about 7:31 you see a sizeable force of random soldiers slaughtering all of your villagers... If I ask for a patch it is this... FIX the AI difficulty curve it is wayy to steep and it could poetentially break a sale away from the company.,(please note that these are the things I saw in the game and your experiance will more than likely vary.)On to the reccomendationsThe visuals,While not major I got a good glimpse at the incrase of quality that was transferred over from its 2000's counterpart. Alot of the edges of buildings are alot smoother and a AI animations and textures run ALOT smoother. This provides the user with a more stable and smoother running game than sometimes before.Slight AI improvementI found this out while fighting certain enemies I could not exploit mechanics like I used to be able to. I saw that the AI had more flexablility than what it used to be. Now this does have a problem. The AI is still STUPID, military units still have that dumb short range of sight and wont hesitate to move if you destroy everything AROUND that circle of sight.What I likeSoo I touched on more bad things than I did good, dont get me wrong. I love this game it brings back alot of memories and what I touched on in my review is the differences that I saw ( or none there of). This game is still a really great and balanced RTS game even to this day. Its simplicity and yet it complex structure is what makes me always come back to it."

However dont let that discourage you, the people who are online are generally willing to play a game or two with you. There is also a massive abundance of different game modes and custom maps that other players have created and brought to the online.The single player story line is rather linear, but it is yet an epic quest that is waiting for you to take on. The single player features many of the playable gods and is rather challenging when playing on the harder difficulties.The replayability is unrivaled as there are 12 different gods to play as and each having 6 minor gods to worship as you advance through the ages. Each minor gods also has its own specific units and upgrades to go along with it. Even on a random map its still fun to play alone with different combination of teammates and enemies to face off against.The graphics are a little outdated but it is an older game being 13 years old. However the lovely people who brought this game to steam have revamped some of the graphics and added a day and night cycle to which you can have on or off depending on your preference.There is one HUGE downside to the online play however. Im not sure what causes it but the servers tend to be a little unstable. Meaning while playing a game online a message will pop up saying server has become unsynched, and will immediately end the game you're in and bring you to the main menu. Unfortunetly you will also have to close out of the game completely and reboot the game on steam to be able to get back into the online menu otherwise it wont let you back in.But other than that id say this game is amazing, and dont let my hrs played fool you ive owned this game since a few months after it came out and id say i have well over 2,000hrs into this game. Every day id come home from school and play this game until i went to bed.Extremely Addicting and fun as all hell! 9.5/10!"

If you can get the original game + expansion for less than steam wants then you're probably not missing much.Good things include: both the original campaign and The Titans expansion campaign both having a slew of different objectives instead of ""build a base, go here and kill these"" of course you usually need some slight variation of that since this is an RTS after all. Factions sometimes with wildly different playstyles, for example the norse workers can only build farms, all other buildings require infantry troops. God powers which can allow you to do anything from summoning a rock which huntable animals flock around to having an earthquake ravage an enemy base (or yours if you're not careful).Bad things include: I'm not sure how balanced the game is, the atlantean faction being the big one: most their god powers can be used multiple times and their (quite expensive) workers don't need to drop off the resources gatherered anywhere. The difficulty settings need some work, on easy the ai will just sit there and wait to be destroyed, most harass you will encounter can be a ship or two assaulting your harbor now and then, while on moderate the ai will sent small squads almost to no end to harass and there's nothing in between those."

That being said, this game is definitely worth getting if you like RTS games, its a classic that will provide a lot of fun and frustration as you conquer your enemies or build up your settlements. Is-volee!"

I think your money can be spent on better games to be honest. If it's on sale then yes get it."

It’s AoE with a legendary twist and some cool new features to go along with it. By far, my favorite thing about this game is the Vikings. Well…and the Kraken, but I’m biased there.God Powers were, I feel, a really cool addition to the game. Is your opponent stealing your resources and/or just being an asshat? Boom! Lightning Bolt! That’s right sucker. But, really, the God Powers are awesome and, depending on which pantheon you choose for your civilization you get different powers. Not all of them are offense oriented, however. There are some that can attract more animals to your town so that you can get more food.Myth Units were another great addition. Sending a horde of Einherjar or Anubites after your opponent is always a good time and a half.The BadAs with Age of Empires II: HD Edition, my complaint for AoM:EE is the non-updated unit graphics. It’s been a long time since this masterpiece was unleashed upon us mere mortals and very little seems to have been done to dress it up.The MehThe price tag is rather steep for as old a game as this.Verdict: YeaAge of Mythology: Extended Edition is a must have for fans of the AoE franchise and lovers of mythology alike. It’s a great, solid RTS to add to your collection. The next time you see it pop up on sale, I’d jump on it. As always, thanks for reading."

Never, in the entire history of my life, have I played a game I enjoyed more than this one. Everything about it is wonderful, or at least in my opinion they are.First off, the amount of mythology that's in the game is, for the most part, a dream come true for me. I've always been a fan of the mythology from Greek and Norse times, so a game based around that sort of thing is pure awesome.The gameplay itself is stellar for an RTS game. More or less standard stuff, you build a base, build an army, kill everyone. However, it is so smooth and so rewarding seeing your accomplishments once you've done this. It also does some other things to help seperate it from other RTS's, including using a God Power system where you can benefit yourself through various powers.The graphics are pretty darn good for a game from 2001 or earlier. The models themselves are dated, but everything else is perfectly fine by my standards.The game also has a damn good story, and an expansion pack inside it as well. Plenty of content.It also has multiplayer, which appears to have been fixed, seeing as I don't get much lag from playing it.10/10, play the ♥♥♥♥ing game already."

Giving each civ a different learning curve was fun too; Greeks well suit those who want to build up huge armies, Egyptians suit those who like a more economic approach and Norse suit those who like early game rushes.

All I can say is till this day, it is still the best RTS I've played. The graphics have been overhauled in the Extended Edition. With the older format, it would not display correctly on 1080p or higher screens.About the game itself, the game is fast faced, great variety and depth and there's a hardcore community that regularly plays online (the most hardcore veterans play on Voobly, but you can always find games to join here on Steam). There was an expansion pack for Chinese Civilization, that needs some patching and it more or less looks like the devs are only focused on AoE2. The last patch for this game was nearly a year ago.Is this game worth the price? In my opinion, there is not a better medieval/high fantasy RTS out there. So if you like RTS or games focused on Greek/Egyptian/Norse mythologies, then yes - its worth every penny."

,Recommended,266840,13924590,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,BadassFreeman,"Picked this up long ago in a sale, when the price finally went down to a decent price. Do I regret buying it? Is it worth picking up? As usual I'll get the bad parts out of the way first, and believe it or not, there are a few here:First and foremost, the price. There's no excuse for this, we're talking about a game that's arround 13 years old (it came out in 2002), and they expect EVERYONE to pay ALMOST 30€!?The f#ck is wrong with you, Microsoft!?I paid arround 6€, and I would pay 10€ MAX. Asking almost 30 for a port is down-right thievery and scamming. Specially when so little effort was put into it...Because yeah, like it or not, this port is lazy. They added Steam Cards, some lazy achievements, and it's Steamworks (or whatever it's called), but that's not enough to put this price on the game. For that price I would expect it to be fully remaked, with new music, textures, models, voices, and more than just one sh#tty new story that was in the official page for ages, and that they didn't even bother to fully translate in all languages. How about A WHOLE NEW RACE, FOR EXAMPLE!? Nah, ♥♥♥♥ that, that would mean put effort into it. I apologize if someone gets offended by this, but Microsoft has been known for being lazy for years and years to come, and things like this won't fix it.Another problem I find with the game are the bugs. I still have the retail version of the game somewhere in my house, with the expansion and all, and I know for a fact that the game had a few bugs... But this? This is near EA-Ubisoft levels. I had my game set on Spanish, mainly for the nostalgia. And you know what the game does? It randomly changes the language of the sounds. Yeah, so fun to be hearing the narrator in Russian when I don't even understand such language. The lighs? They do crazy stuff too! If you look to a hill, the lighs of the lower parts of the map suddenly get so bright, you almost think the sun just exploded. The units? They glitch at times too, getting stuck in weird places, or when being affected by powers, the effects change colors for no reason. For example, Set's summoned units at times change their weird ""Green"" aura when there are too many of them together, and suddenly become pink. I have no idea how is it possible to port an old game that just had a few glitches and make it so it's a Glitch-fest, but they did it.The last problem I had it's not really their fault NOW, but rather when the game was released years ago: The game is insanely easy. I had to put the Hardest difficulty to make the AI haveANY CHANCEduring the original story, to the point that it got boring, and that's an issue that for some reason, it's on a lot of Microsoft games, like Dust; An Elysian Tail. Of course, you wouldn't notice such things when you're arround 8 years old and playing the game for the first time, but come on! Couldn't they fix the difficulty and AI? Their main problem is that, even if they're way more powerful than you, they're scared and won't fight unless they can DESTROY THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF YOU WITHOUT EFFORT. I have even tested it, alone vs 11 other bots. It took them arround 20 minutes to destroy me. I REPEAT, ALONE AGAINST 11 BOTS. That's just pathetic.All of that being said, does the game have good stuff? You bet your #ss! The game is quite well-balanced (Well, the Expansion race might be a bit too powerful on my opinion), with each race working in complete different ways (in contrast with Age of Empires, where it's hard to spot that many differences from one race to another): The Greek are the ""balanced"" race, having expensive but powerful troops, the Egyptians being more focused in economy and defense while also being able to swarm with cheap troops, the Nords being the most offensive race with little defensive stuff and building with the soldiers, and the Atlanteans, who can turn any of their troops into heroes, and can use their powers more than once. Each race also has their own Titans, but they act exactly the same, and that's kind of a let-down.Multiplayer is where this game shines, like it happend with Age of Empires. Matches feel fair, there are quite a lot of maps to play, with also randomly generated ones. The map editor? I've already seen some beautiful stuff on it, though I haven't personally tried any map with friends yet. Matches sure as hell can take too long at times if the players are too passive (you know, the classic p#ssy that only focuses on the economy for like, 30 minutes until he Steam-rolls everyone), but fairly enough that's why the Nords exist, they attack other players fast and can even hold their own in Late-game with sick powers like the Ragnarok. The only part about this that I don't like, are maps with water. Dunno if it's just me, but I hate fighting with ships, it's just boring.The story-mode, even while extremely easy, can be entertaining. The story line has some clichés but it's both decent ANDEDUCATIONAL! HOLY MOTHER OF F#CK, you learn a lot of Mythology with this game! Back when I played this in 2002-2003, I was really interested in the old times, and that's one of the reason why I liked this game: It's just like those dumbf#cks of the old times though the real world was: With weird messed up creatures everywhere, Gods among men and all that crap. You can even pause the game to check the Lore of each unit on the game, something that can be fun if you're actually interested in story, like me.Is the game worth it? Yeah. But not at this crazy price. Wait for a good sale, and if possible, have a friend to play with. I'd say the game is worth picking at arround 10€, NOT MORE. If it goes even lower, then you should probably Wololo your own balls and commit sudoku.Oh and, please: If you even play online, don't be one of those Casuals who just focus on the Economy for half an hour. If you do so, don't just ragequit when the nords blow you up, FIGHT LIKE IF YOU HAD ANY BALLS, DAMN IT!"

The original game came out when I was 7 years old, and it didn't take a long time for me to play this with a friend. He lend it to me for quite a while, I played quickly through all of the campaigns and countless of matches against the AI. There sure were months where I didn't play this, but I've always played this game. At some point I just bought a copy for myself, continued to play custom matches and then discovered the glorious multiplayer. Oh ESO, R.I.P. in peace. I played through almost all maps/modes in existence it feels and even got up to create a Mythodea map myself, meaning I had to learn a ♥♥♥♥♥on of triggers and neat tricks for mapdesign. At some point ESO (Ensemle Studios Online) was shut down, so when I came back to the game, I surely was surprised. But that didn't keep me from playing AoM online. I found GameRanger and Voobly, programms that allow you to play your favorite games online, even after the official server shutdown! Huge thanks to them for keeping awesome games alive. And then, this appeared. I immediatly got it with a friend at release, but we quickly stuck to the old version, as this EE was laggy as ♥♥♥♥. We checked over the course of time and at some point the lag was fixed. Now this is just a masterpiece of a game, revived.+ You have a ♥♥♥♥♥on of gods, meaning a game does never play the same, as there are tons of options for every player to chose from+ The developers give a good look into mythology, having lore texts backed up for almost all units/gods+ The two campaigns are really good+ The graphics aged well, and the EE just gives it a nice new look+ Mother♥♥♥♥ing mythical units everywhere, stomping, throwing, spitting fire and♥♥♥♥♥♥+ Fairly balanced between factions+ Up to 12 players in a game+ Modding/mapping tools+ Mappers like Nottud returned and are now making fun maps for this version of the game+ Skepan, Jegweg, Prostagma- Player base is not that big- All old maps/mods cannot be used with this version- If you play with many people/bots for quite a while, graphical bugs can appear. These can take forms of missing texture, missing minimap and stuck effects.If you are into RTS games and liked the Age of Empires series, or even played the old Age of Mythology, I 100% suggest you have a look into this.

It's incredibly satisfying to smite your opponent with Zeus' lightning bolt, or rain meteors down upon their city, or summon a mighty Titan to smash through their battle lines. Worshiping different gods provides different god powers, allowing for plenty of variety in play style. The single-player campaign is solid, and there's plenty of variety in maps and game modes to play stand-alone matches. This game needed a sequel. It's great."

I can say that while this does polish up the graphics thats about all it does (unless you are interested in multiplayer it has that too).The single player is exactly what you remember if you played the original and the tale of the dragon is well, if you ever downloaded one of those custom campaigns for the original that was clearly made by kids, its allot like that. Chinese myth units look out of place and while the human units look okay they don't add much.The multiplayer works I guess, but I have allot of fun on it and it's what I spend most my time on because when it doesnt desynch it's allot of fun, not many toxic player either which is always a plus.It also has map editor which is actually pretty good, if you like making maps I think you'll like this feature because its very deep and allows whatever you want in terms of control, you can place every unit change a single or multiple units stats, make cutscenes scenarios even mini games like tower defence or rpgs.Overall this is a good game but age of mythology was always a good game.

Big TimeNow that we have that out of the way, this game is awesomeif you and your friends love multiplayer. At one time, the new Chinese Faction was a problem but its mostly been balanced now. It certainlylooks better than the old AoM. There are may balances, units that should be stronger are stronger.Compered to Titans, the changes can be listed off as:1. Better Atlaneans. Their units got Armor boost.2. Norse have Archers, and so aren't completely outmatched(I'm not sure if its good, my friend plays Norse and I hate this).3. Some upgrades are cheaper and somemore expensive, and it works out well.4. Lightning Storm does damage expected from a 4th age God Power.There are may more. This game shines best when played with other people.

Maybe it's some nostalgia at play as well, but for those looking for a fun RTS-game this is worth checking out.

I attempted to create about 5 random games and each time it chose only from the new DLC for the opponents.  At least 2 games had all 3 AI opponents using the same DLC major god.  Since I do not have the new expansion it would generate the game, load it in, and then immediately force me to quit back to the menu because the AIs were using things from the DLC that I am not yet able to buy.It was extremely frustrating so I am likely just going to put this game on the backburner for a few months and maybe come back to it later."

Now, after some serious patchwork, this game is the revived experience that I have been looking for! With enhanced graphical features that add more definition to the environment that you are playing in as well as the added feature of adding day and night cycle lighting, the world of Age of Mythology is made more stunning than the original release. New maps have also been added through preceding updates that also tests players to try new styles of play.Simply put, for those who have nostalgic memories of playing this game or would like to play a classic made by Ensemble Studios (and a game enhanced by SkyBox Labs), Age of Mthology: Extended Edition is a game that I would recommend.(I should mention, however, that you should probably select the properties of the game in your library and under ""BETAS"" you should select the beta titled ""Preview Patch Beta"" before you initiate gameplay in Age of Mythology: Extended Edition.)"

The campaign is quite enjoyable and many players are sufficiently satisfied with the single player experience to not have the majority of the issues bother them(most issues are regarding civ balancing and online play).The game has 4(or 5 if you get the DLC) civilizations with 3 major gods per civilization that each have their own minor god paths. These builds influence a variety of things including gathering, armies, myth units and mighty godpowers that can level buildings or temporarily summon an undead army(there's many more!).Generally the game has an accepted view on the gods and which ones are more powerful than others but for the average player everything goes and you'll never really have to worry about the limitations of your gods. Unfortunately the latest DLC that included the chinese gods did a poor job of balancing the civilization and the consensus is that they are much too powerful as things stand which may lead to people requesting not to play them.Another unfortunate part of the game is networking. Age of Mythology is a peer-to-peer game instead of hosted by a server. This means that games are prone to lag if players live far apart which may very well be the case since there is no filter for regions.Word has it there are still patches in the works to fix the networking to be more stable and to balance out the chinese civilization but the game is undeniably riddled with various bugs and balancing issues that have not seen any attention for many years. This won't bother the beginners or noob players so if you intend to play the game casually you shouldn't be too worried about the nuances of balancing civilizations and the likes.The verdict:It's a great game really. It's a lot more slow paced than games like Starcraft and the units are unique. There's plenty of players to play 1v1's, 2v2's and 3v3's but anything beyond that is very prone to lag. There's custom maps for the people who like that and a campain to give you that old-school vibe strategy games used to give. The veteran players will inevitably bash this game because their demands have grown over time but if you love strategy games the cost can very well be justified."

Minimal voice acting, the missions are a bit boring, glitchy special effects during cutscenes, the new devs haven't had much experience so the stuff they put together for the cutscenes feels super flat and the ""new"" units seem familiar... I'd bet money on animations being reused and only small assets like weapons and armour being changed (Or simply modified in many cases it appears). Even the Heroes from the main campaign look surprisingly similar to Arkantos and his son Kastor, while their abilities are reused from Ajax... And then you get the myth units which really do look like reskins - I was quite skeptical of all the reviews complaining about the DLC until I played the first 3 missions myself. Everything they say is true.If you're worried about all the negative reviews saying that this crashes constantly, it'd be worth noting that people are more likely to post a negative review than a positive one. Take it with a pinch of salt. Everybody has a different system, and it is fairly likely that the game will work just fine for you if you have a average system.I want to give credit where credit is due - Skybox have done a great job in 'purtyfying' the game, and they had really large shoes to fill when it came to adding more content. Hopefully they don't abandon this game and come back for another try.As it stands, I'd recommend buying both the main game and Tale of the Dragon during a fairly steep sale (60%+ off). £23 is wayyyyyy too much for the main game. I don't know what Microsoft was smoking when they set the prices for this, but whatever it was I want some since clearly it's potent♥♥♥♥♥♥"

I'm therefore turning my recommendation to a thumbs down. The original has worked just fine, but there's some bug that's developed in the new system. I'll change it once fixed.Of course I'd recommend this game. For a 10 year old RTS, it's still one of the best out there, and I'm very grateful it has become available on Steam. If you haven't played it, I can't recommend it enough! HOWEVER, the new Extended Edition is really just Steams way of repackaging old content. The graphics look a little better, and there are some minor additional features (from sort-of-cool, to annoying). There's really no reason I'd recommend this over the $10 version you've been able to find on the discount game rack at Staples. The additional content is NOT worth the $20 extra they charge on steam.

The Extended Edition has added quite a bit of features to an already unforgettable computer game from the Windows XP era. Outside of support for newer operating systems such as Windows 8.1, the team behind the new revamped line of classic PC games for Steam audiences added stuff like TwitchTV, steam friend invites in the multiplayer lobby, new graphical effects (mostly with lighting and the new water textures), new native resolutions for widescreen monitors, and other visual tweaks mostly...but have the left the fun gameplay largely intact (for those not wanting a tainted AOM). All the great single player campaign and multiplayer content from the original AOM is here, as well as the included content from the Titans expansion pack. Probably a bit too pricey at its suggested retail price ($29.99) for a title that has recieved numerous reprints via jewel case release, but a MUST BUY if you catch this particular version on a Steam sale (especially for someone running a new monitor/GPU/OS)."

Each race having a unique play style keeps the game really interesting. Fun to customize playing strategy using different god abilitys from advancing through ages in addition to main god choice in beginning.

The game's writers do a brilliant job of making these seemingly disparate elements fit together and work, with a surprisingly engaging story campaign, entertaining characters, iconic heroes and monsters, and a huge amount of detail that demonstrates a real passion for the source material. The game serves up fun, humour and personality in spades, and features unique ""god power"" mechanics that set it apart from similar titles and introduce a whole new level of strategy (and wanton destruction) to an already solid gameplay structure, which is both satisfyingly complex and easily accessible to new players. Whilst the Extended Edition does very little to change or improve upon the original game (not that such alterations are necessary) it nonetheless makes this cult classic available on modern systems, provides an updated community platform and features new, higher-resolution graphics and textures that make this already beautiful game even better to look at. In summary, Age of Mythology is a unique, effortlessly enjoyable strategy game, and the Extended Edition is well worth your time and money."

It is, instead, part of the Age of Empires series, which I've sadly never got on with. I find AoE either too relentless and fast-paced as a strategy war game (with too many areas spread out and too many units to manage so the scope of what you need to keep an eye on overwhelms me), or too slow and uninteresting as a sandbox.Age of Mythology has none of the elements that I enjoy in city sims, so I can't recommend it.

I remember seeing this new edition in the steam store a few years back and feeling the nostalgia. The original game was PERFECT. Unfortunately Microsoft has ruined this game with garbage updates and a Chinese expansion that is completely irrelevant to the game. To make it even worse, the Chinese expansion is unbalanced and pay to play. Even the graphics optimization is trash. I can run games like Siege past 60fps with no drops, but for this game I have to tweak the settings just to play. The multiplayer is also dying and most games are laggy because I'm playing with people halfway across the world. I can tell this edition was rushed as a quick money grabber and the dev team does not care about it at all. If you can, buy the original AOMT and use voobly."

I bought it on sale in July for about $6.00. I am disabled, crippled by my afflictions, and on a very limited budget. I find myself hospitalized...a lot. I tried the game for about 20 minutes, loving the nastalgia and the feel of new from the updated visuals as I did my usual test run to verify my new purchase worked. I soon became afflicted by my conditions, and lost my ability to use my pc for a while.I tried earlier this week to get on it, and on my Windows 10 Anniversary edition 64 bit platform where it once worked perfectly, it draws a line that covers about 3/4 of the screen (after clicking start game on the launcher which runs fine, if you want a BS effect only!) with a black box before crashing, often causing a BS kind of freeze that requires restart (won't alt tab or otherwise vanish, even if you pull maintenance up and tell it to terminate) just to get back to desktop! I tried all the different tricks, making it run in compat modes and the like. Windows reports it as a broken and defective product. My system has not changed from what it was when I first purchased the game.So, I contact STEAM support...twice. Both times I was denied any kind of assistance or refund, even though I have spent thousands here and never once asked for anything in my entire 7+ years as a member! I am made to eat a broken game that will not work. I am reporting it as a theft and breach of contract, and a misuse of my Federally provided disability funds to try and seek remedy, and have since stopped giving STEAM any of my money. They have lost my trust, as have the devs of this game.So, I'd give it all negatives if I could, because my system hasn't changed, I can't seem to roll back the install once updated, and even opting into betas doesn't work for me. The problem isn't on my end. All my stuff is up and current, and nothing else has issues. This game ran fine upon purchase, where I got 20 minutes total to play the game before it magically was updated to stop working between then and this week, the only other time I have tried it since the purchase date. Shame, it was a good game. I still have the classic, and it runs fine in compat mode, and doesn't pay any dividends to those who would release a defective product! Shameful devs! Shameful STEAM. This is why I distrust digital, and why you all should resist the digital age movement. They will only get worse if you let them. Don't support this kind of garbage.UPDATE: As of 1/2/2017, without the help of any devs and only limited help from the community, I myself was able to hunt down a fix after many failed attempts, but only if they do not do another game breaking update. For those who suffer with this issue, see my post in the support thread for this game here on Steam for a play by play on how to get your copy working. Takes a lot of steps, but should work if you try it, providing you have no other install or hardware issues that I do not have. The key is the 20!5 C++ x64 and x86 runtimes. Dimwits had to have changed some internal coded references to those packages, breaking the damned thing."

Age of Empire's camaign was appauling both on a story level and on a gameplay level. The plot was weak, its strands were all over the place, pacing was non-existant thanks to you spending time trying to complete the same objective for 3 or 4 mission, the dialogue was cheesey and full of cliches and the characters were so one-dimentional. The only characters that get even a basic backstory are the gods through the myths and legends that they are based on. As for the gameplay, despite the rare unique scenario (Tug of War being one of them), gameplay became rather samey and stale by the third mission and continue to disapoint me. I couldn't be asked to play a mission asking me basically to build up a base and attack an enemy target so I started using cheats to turns two or three hours of boring gameplay into 30 minutes of chuckles and laser bears or puple flying hippoes annihaled the enemies defences, Whenever I did overwelm an oposition's forces with or without cheats, no matter how strong my offencive, it seems that the oposition is too strong for eighty archers or two-hundred flying purple hippoes so the protagnists, being the womderful stratergists pull their forces back, where does that leave me as a player? I feel that I have been punished for completing one objctive only to find that the characters couldn't hold the objective.Now, multiplayer was far more fine. It moves along at a steady pace whether you rush, build or mess around and the post-game stats option is quite an interesting feature. I like how each 'Set' of gods have their own unique abilities and each god has something unique about them. I like the building, the way they look the way they all seem uniquue and iconic to make to you can look at one building to fnd your armoury or to find your tow centre and I like how the buildings change as you age up. Comunity, I haven't met them yet, but I've heard most lobbies tend to rush. I'm not a fan of rushing. That style of gameplay is too short. You might find that the game is over before it has even begun and that can get inreadibly repetive and boring after a while in my books. As a member of the oposition I could always defend from a rush, but ussually, that would result  in a long and pointless struggle as my oposition will always be two steps ahead of me if they're good or I could learn how to fight fire with fire and rush them but that would only result in a strenuous base race. I love playing long games when it comes to RTS' against players with my equivilant skill. It means that both sides, no matter who wins will enjoy themselves fighting off oponents for a long time with no player able to overpower the other without a great struggle. A kind of tug of war gameplay with no clear victor makes for a very long and very fun game.The campaign is the worst campaign that I have ever played and despite the playstyle of the majority of the comunity, I like the multiplayer"

The PC port works perfectly fine and it is great to have this addition onto Steam. Why do I not recommend this title is because the game has only been slightly enhanced and does not feel they put time and effort making this game play better and rework the graphics which are just shoehorned from its original release. It's Age of Mythology for ♥♥♥♥ sake I know a lot of you loved this game growing up and playing it as a kid and would love to see it on Steam, but to see it getting some rework into it just to show appreciation to the fans. Do we get that... NoTo say this game is 'extended' is just a lie because if the expansion was not added in it would feel silly to do a Updated AOM 10 years after and not to add the content made by the devs that was a expansion ten years ago. What really lets me down about this new port of AOM is that the graphics are subpar for modern PC's, so they could have spent time reworking models, sprites and maps to make the game have some aesthetic quality to it. The controls response is slow and this is a bad thing for a RTS were response needs to be fast and precise so you can move units with ease. AI is bad, from the pc comp and so is your ai when they go into combat mode. My units do not attack on command even when I set them on Attack mode. This could just be a bug, but I don't think it is. It is fustrating to see your units not behaving like they want to fight and being all laise faire. In game icons are ♥♥♥♥ing ugly why haven't they reworked simple textures to make them look more attractive and it's a shame they just cut copy paste that from the orignal game ten years ago; where is the love?For 30 bucks here in AUS it is not worth it. Wait for the game to price drop to get your money's worth. Yeah it's sad to see devs to go for the workshop get out of jail free card and let the people who respect the franchise to make enhancements. No offense if I was a developer and I was getting out done by some guy who does a mod for free, I would feel pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about myself because I get paid to make a video game. I think a lot of you will disagree with me, but when you are charging 30 bucks for a revamp and it turns out to be crap, it deserves to get a lot of criticism. Just wait for the game to drop to 10 bucks and get your moneys worth then."

I have at least 100 hours dedicated to this game and for it to come back just makes me jump for joy. Besides being a SOLID RTS and utilizing a great counter balance system with units, the game has unique features to it as well. The fact that you can choose the gods you worship that tie in different units and tech trees gives the game a unique feel to it almost every time. Every civilization is completely different in how it obtains resources and trains units. I must say, my absolute favortite part of this game has to do with how much map editing one can do. The online games were GREAT for delving into custom maps that were a combination of campaign style with almost an RPG feel with map triggers all over. I never played anything like it at the time. The players of this game really make it go the extra mile and show how much you really can do with the games mechanics. I'll never forget the Seige of Troy custom map that a player created and it was complete with cinematics and waves of troops.... it was incredible! Definitely recommend this game to anybody that enjoyed any of the  Age of Empires games or any RTS for that matter!"

The story is well done, and has a ton of ineresting maps and scenarios put into it. When you finally get through the story mode, you can still find alot of gameplay through multiplayer and creating your own/playing on custom maps.A big thing for this release is the mods. Even with the initially small community, their is still a good deal of great content including texture changes, new models, new custom maps and some UI overhauls as well. Even better than the mods was the introduction of the much better and polished multiplayer system as opposed to the less refined version of the original.A truly epic game, and a must buy for anyone who had previously found any fun in the Age of Empires series.

Especially when in order to play at god-tier level, you must micromanage to the last unit. When I was younger, all I did was build good looking cities and when I got bored, destroyed the rest. Right now I still can't play past intermediate, as the AI still runs me over with their superior micromanaging and seemingly infinite economy.Do I enjoy it anyway? HELL yes. I'm just really bad at it is all.Even if you're horrible at RTS, Age of Mythology, along with pretty much any Age of Empires game, is a good pick up. It will at the very least teach you the basics of RTS, and even when you're done learning the basics, it still has a pretty high skill cap that you can further explore online against other players. There's really no such thing as the game being too easy or too hard, because you can play as you grow.Besides, nothing beats cheating in an army of 100 flying purple hippos."

There are even a number of maps off the original AOM community website I have yet to try or play.  The map editor itself is a fantastic tool, once you've learned how to handle the event editor within it, of course.  The game as a whole is even such that I can look past how horrible I am at real time stratedgy, I just have fun playing it no matter what mode it is I play in.This game being on steam makes it so much easier to play it when I can't bring the original's disks around with me.

Just from one of the two vanilla stories, it's worth it's price tag, and there are 2 whole stories to it, a level editor, multiplayer.There are problems with this version that weren't there in the previous versions.For one, they took out the cheat codes, even in the vanilla story mode. I personally have fond memories of giant canadian caped flying bears who would shoot laser beams to take out the strongest of enemies, of running over building with giant 4 wheelers, and so forth, which actually takes away from the enjoyment heavily.That being said, this game is still strong without the wackiness, it's a good way to get you interested in Greek Mythology like it did to me as a kid, and it's a solid rts game with decent balance and variances between the different religions/civilizations.In reality, I would rank it as one of the better rts games to my knowledge, which is extremely dated and probably took place from 14 or so years ago up to around 7 years ago. I consider this game only second to the Battle for Middle Earth series and it's deeply ingrained into my childhood.The characters are never really all that fleshed out even though you're supposed to have an attachment to the characters, especially the villains who seem like named canon fodder hero enemies, but the troops are all fairly unique to each other, even though you'll almost never be using human troops even fully upgraded in later ages (progression system in specific matches)Overall it's a solid game that's worth trying out, but the enhanced edition doesn't actually enhance anything but the water and day and night cycle when it would have been interesting to have myth troops. If you're a completionist, you'll enjoy the achievements, if you want a solid rts with an interesting theme and fun dynamics to different cultures, this is a good buy. If you're a psychopath like me, you'll also enjoy level editor where you'll talk like you're the characters and make your own story.7/10Masterpiece when viewed with nostalgia."

My old laptop had a bit of trouble running this game but my new computer has no problems. I think my biggest disappointment is the fact that they didn't update any of the unit models and the UI wasn't altered at all, in other words the UI is designed for  4:3 screen when most screens today are at 16:9.The campaign in this game is better than any other in an RTS game I have played and would buy this game just to play the two full length campaigns.

Now however, they release the first real update for the game and charge loyal players twice the price for a tiny bit of content than what they charge new players. 10 USD more for something which is otherwise available for 5USD that should have just been included in the game."

It's one of my favourite games of all time with an amazing campaign. If I was judging on gameplay alone I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a solid RTS game. However, this is the 'Extended Edition' which is meant refresh the game to make it ready for Steam.I purchase this during a Steam sale so I was satisfied with the price. However, the standard price appears to be $35.99, which is insane for what you're actually getting.The game looks great, no doubt about it, especially with the updated water, shadows etc. Despite this, when I first fired up the game I was immediately disappointed by the interface. During startup the old Kronos title screen has been replaced with an out of place loading bar on top of an incorrectly sized background. All of the menus have buttons that look out of place. I noticed that some of the backgrounds to the loading screens are merely stretchted instead of properly scaled up. What happened to the lovely glowing green/blue coloured loading bars, which fitted into the overall scheme?In game the interface appears to have just been centered on the screen instead of fitting to the full width. It seems a bit picky that I'm complaining about the user interface after the work that must have gone into refreshing the game, but the interface is a big part of the experience of this game for me and it's left me a bit disappointed.In summary, the great gameplay is intact, but I have some gripes about how they decided to approach the refit of the UI elements."

Age of Mythology Extended lets you choose 4 different civilizations, because the Titans expansion is included. Of each of these civs you can choose 3 different greater gods, which each have different lesses gods. This allows you to choose different unit upgrades which will give you that notch to win from your opponent.Fun online multiplayer games are Chasing the Turkey and Team Trojan Wall.The AI is challenging, but not very advanced in their pathfinding to your base, they will generally attack the same area over and over.Overall, not tournament stuff but a fun game, really recommend it to people who like RTS, the AoE series or people interested in Mythology!"

You still skate, but on different boards, then all of the sudden, youre told that you can get that old skateboard back with the same designs, wheels, trucks, and all of the goodies that it had, just fresher, newer, nicer.You go to get that new skateboard, only to open the box and realize that it is your old skateboard, with a fancy new sticker on it, calling it ""new"".Same old graphics, maybe a little updated, i did not notice a difference.

Simple enough for kids to pick up and play and just about complex enough for RTS veterans to enjoy weaving intricate strategies and balancing resource spending.The campaigns are a nice little feature, so far as pre-set RTS scenarios go, they're enjoyable enough. (Though you'll probably only play through them once, admittedly.) The main meat of the game comes in online multiplayer and offline 'random maps' (which actually aren't that random. You can choose the map, your opponents and just about everything else.) where you're pitted against another player or a (surprisingly decent) AI to fight in a number of gamemodes. The variety in gamemodes is only about five choices, and these gamemodes pretty much all boil down to ""Destroy the enemy!"" but they're fun nonetheless, and the wide selection of maps (enhanced even further by Steam workshop integration) and gods to choose from make for a much more varied and replayable game than may appear at first glance.Be aware though, players of the original AoM in particular. The amount of HD'ing and upscaling means this game takes more to run than you might be expecting. Early glitches and issues are being resolved quickly, and I've personally seen my game performance improve over the past few weeks thanks to patches from the devs.If I'm honest, I can't truly say that I'd be willing to pay £23 for this. It IS a fun game with all its expansions, but it's an old and comparatively simple one and £23 just seems too much to me.However, if you're like me and loved it as a kid, the £23 price tag isn't too much for the nostalgia hit.Everyone else, if it drops to around £15 or lower, I'd highly recommend buying it."

There are still minor bugs being fixed, but nothing too game breaking.I know a lot of that is negative but this really is a fantastic game, and it brings back a lot of good memories from when I was younger. If you like Age of Empires: 2/3 then you will have a rough draft of how the game works. I personally feel it is a little bit more complicated but much more enjoyable.

AOM was also ruined by the Titans expansion pack but in game play and adding more bugs especially when trying to play maps created in AOM.    not impressed with this ""remastering"" of AOM or ""AOT""i really like this game, but all the problems it has makes it nearly unplayable."

The game is worth the full price of 30 dollars, but if you are a bit tight on cash or a bit of a Eugene Krabs you could wait for a sale to pop out and reap that. I am a new player to the Age Series but when I booted up the game, I instantly loved it. One thing I absolutely love about the game is that unlike Civilization or other titles it is all real time, no waiting on your opponents/friends to make their moves, just you and your villagers. Another thing I like about this game is that it is a low-spec requiring game; no hassle over if you or your friends can run it. Multiplayer is incredibly fun with friends but alas the game is not perfect. The game is not pleasing to the eyes but you can download some texture packs to slightly remedy the problem, but really if the game is fun you shouldn't worry about how the game looks. The animation (including movement) in the game aren't so good either, at first it seemed that my game was laggy but really it was just the animations. The networking sometimes is a drag as well, when a multiplayer game is lost due to loss of connection it is difficult to get that map back and running. The campaign is good as well as the map editor. Oh, and mods. Mods are nice. tl;dr Get the game.TL;DRGet the gamePros:-Low spec game-Fun multiplayer-Real time (No waiting like Civilization games)-Steam Workshop integration-Map EditorCons:-Outdated graphics-Strange animations-Networking sometimes can be a drag-Vectoring is not that great."

When it was first released on Steam, this revamp was unplayable and a disgrace to the beauty that was AoM.I would like to recant that review. I recently came back to it to try it again to see if it had been improved. The issues many had in the early days have been nearly perfectly restored. I had a very slight issue on a rare occassion with a main hero completely disappearing from my map (I can specifically remember it happening on on of my Atlantean missions) but other than that, I can recall absolutely no issues playing through both the full campaign as well as the extended content and custom matches. Well done to team working on this to listen to the complaints of the players.All-in-all, I would personally change my original 2 star rating to a 5 out of 5.

The graphics were good for a game of its time, but what really satisfied me was the mechanics; it's simple to learn, hard to master. The original and Titans expansion campaigns are well-made and could easily last you over 20 hours, depending on your playstyle and difficulty. Freeplay with bots is good, with AI being fairly strong at higher levels, but not understanding how to cross water very well. There is a scenario editor which I seldom use, but the potential is there to create a custom level/scene.Now for the extended edition. Multiplayer servers are far from stellar in responsiveness, but they're free, and multiplayer is great fun with friends. The devs added hilarious cheats that are a blast to try out, would highly recommend it. The graphics are enhanced, but it's nothing to go crazy over. I found this had a much better feel than AOE II, but was still similar (if that's your kind of game). I would recommend this game on sale."

,Recommended,266840,28907436,Posted: 1 January,all,Carebear,If you are downloading this it most likely same reason most of us have. The most honoest review I can give is this is a double edged sword.What does this game give you?If you played the original back in the day the game allows you to go back and enjoy for what was a fantastic game. The game has been slightly upgraded visually but overall the core of this game is still there. All the campaign is playable and you able to play both titan and non titan edition.What it takes from you?If you loved this game in the past you may purchase this to a slight horror that it has not treated well by these new developers. First the game performs okay but can troubles depending on your CPU core setup. Second as you notice new dlc content has been added to the game which in fairness is OPTIONAL. However this is obivously a gimmick to make money and the DLC is poorly made and unbalanced and not taken any strategy or even looked at adding the meta of this game.This remaster is a double edged sword in terms of purchase. I recommend buying for those who want to re visit a great time in gaming but do not purchase the DLC. If this game is on sale I would say purchase for your collection.

We have put so many hours into that game, playing the campaign over and over again, annihilating countless AI enemies in Supremacy rounds, learning all of the cheatcodes by heart (L33T SUPA H4X0R is the best of them all).When we heard that The Titans expansion came out, we were thrilled. New gods, new maps, new campaign. It has it all. Many hours went in that also.Over the years, my interest into the game dropped off. I got spoiled by Steam Sales and Humble Bundles.But then the announcement came: Age of Mythology would have a Steam release, with all of the expansions (even one I have never heard of).

When I booted up the game I scouted the main menu and stumbled upon all mythology tutorials as well as 4 campaigns in total, two of which I had not seen before. I have played new Chinese side and have come to a conclusion on all five religions. Greeks are best for beginners, well rounded and easiest to use. Egyptians are harder to use but are the beat for seige and guerilla warfare tactics. The Norse are for the more barbarian natures, but are no less fun. Best for hiding and annoying others with hit and run tactics. The atlantean armies have the most heroes, and their armies are the hardest to use. Until the Chinese came. They use the most confusing mix of units but for someone who underatands them they can be a force to be feared.Anyone who wants to play, buy the game with a group of friends and let them know what you are made of."

SkyBox came along and remastered it, adding a few bits here and there to make it work better on modern machines. And it is awesome!PROS:+Like many of the Age of Empires games, this one is easy to learn, but difficult to master. There's a lot of potential for nearly any kind of RTS strategy.+Each of the four different factions has its own unique playstyle. The Greeks are a comprehensive, vanilla faction for understanding the games' more complex mechanics, the Norse are better-suited to rushers and highly combative players, the Egyptians are excellent at defensive gameplay, and the Atlanteans are very noob-friendly, easy to learn for first-time visitors to the RTS genre.+The game has a number of combat triangles, from the Infantry/Cavalry/Archers to the Human/Myth Unit/Hero to the Arrow Ship/Hammer Ship/Siege Ship.+There are a number of resources to manage collection, especially for building different types of armies (ie prodominantly cavalry).+Game introduces God Powers, similar to abilities in MOBAS. These can change the game at a critical moment by various means (ie burning down a forest the enemy was using as part of their wall, earthquaking their fortresses, or forcing a caesefire for a minute).+Game introduces myth units and heroes, each of which have their own different special abilities to give them an edge over their enemies.+Instead of researching new ages of technology, you pick new gods to worship, each giving their own unique units, god powers, and bonuses to compliment your playstyle.+Multiple different ways to play, from rushing to turtling to building a wonder. Each is viable in its own way.+Surprisingly good soundtrack, and decent enough sound effects.+Main campaign (Fall of the Trident) is surprisingly fun to play through.+Mods!+Map editor! (Impressively comprehensive and can be used to make some seriously cool things).+Audio taunts!+Extended Edition remasters the graphics to look far better than they once did, including the option for a day/night cycle, AA, shadows, and improved water.+Extended Edition also offers Achievements, Trading Cards, and Twitch Integration.+Extended Edition offers a few new maps and a new option to disable Titans (wheras before, the normal strategy for winning games was rushing to build a titan before your opponent).+Access to online play again, including ranked play!CONS-Second and third campaigns (Atlantis Reborn and The Golden Gift) are very lacking The former appears to only exist to showcase the new faction while the latter feels like a fanmade project thrown up after a few days' work.-Audiotaunt spam (especially 999 taunt) can get annoying.-Frequent lag when playing with friends (for me, this only exists for about 2-3 minutes before going away).-I've heard of many people being unable to launch the game. I've never had this issue.By itself, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is a great game to play. If you don't have it (or the original), or love the RTS genre, I'd strongly recommend it. If you do have the original, I'd more cautiously recommend it, mainly if it was on sale. While there are a number of improvements, they aren't substantial enough to warrant purchase for their own sake."

So the nostalgia was also a great addition to the already enjoyable game. The only thing I could see people deterring from the game would be the graphics. Honestly, after playing it for awhile it's really not that bad and you can read and distinguish items/units easily. It's a game about intelligence once you get on a harder level. The multiplayer and AI battles really add more after the campaign. I'm 21 hours into the game and I still haven't completed the campaign.

It's the game I remember playing. Good fun, good strategy game. The soundtrack to the game is great as well.There are some problems with the game however:The biggest problem with the campaigns is that moderate, hard (never played Titan mode) seem to be inconsistent in the gameplay. I'll play moderate in a few campaigns which gave me a challenge but then the next game played at moderate level will feel like hard or Titan. The NPC just throws units at me in a way that wouldn't be possible playing a real person. In some sense, although I know the levels add difficulty purposely, I wish that all the campaign games at moderate level FELT like they were set up/played at moderate level.There seems to be a bug with the walls you build, occasionally. I'll build a wall but enemy units will pass through regardless. At first I thought it was a break in the wall but no, it's happened several times with walls that I knew had no breaks. Just something to watch for.Also, multiplayer is just about dead. Tried to get on again with only four games going and was dropped three times due to game hosts being fickle or unrealistic about number of people in game so probably won't even bother with multiplayer. There haven't been any events run, perhaps only one or two when the game was re-released on Steam but other than that, nothing so if you do purchase, purchase for the solo play, not multiplayer. It's a shame. Seemed promising."

The mechanics and graphics may even be worse than AoE, but it's still playable for days on end, especially with new advanced ai mods.

As if that wasn't bad enough, they made a DLC for Age of Mythology (which, in my opinion, works much less effectively than Age of Empires II, as AoM's civilizations are *drastically* different, although in AoE2 they all use the same base).And God, was it♥♥♥♥♥♥Age of Mythology: Tale of the Dragon adds the Chinese to the game. Not only are they completely broken and overpowered, but they caused many, many bugs. The campaign coming along with the package is so bad, I bet that a passionate person could cook up a better scenario. It just feels like the ""developers"" ♥♥♥♥ed around with the editor and♥♥♥♥♥♥out this mediocre thing (which they probably did, now that I think of it).Despite all of these flaws, I have to point out that Age of Mythology is far more accessible and casual than its more competitive cousin, Age of Empires II. Age of Mythology's engine is also more dynamic and in full 3D, which might be a huge point for some people.All in all, I recommend that you grab Age of Mythology: Extended Edition on sale, if you fill one (or both) of these critera:-You want to (re)play the campaign and experience a game that is part of the greatest of RTS series.-You want to play online with your friends (trust me, finding a good game and having it stable is a nightmare).Despite the people behind this reedition being absolutely incompetent, you can recognize the good work of now-dead Ensemble Studios, and it well worth your time."

He talked it up a lot, so going in back then I had quite high expectations... and they were met and then some!It's a really good game. Of course it has aged a bit, but it's a great classic. It's a mix of interesting complex gameplay and whacky diverse powerful myth creatures and god powers! A simple, yet very loveable RTS game.

I don't regret it one bit.I'm gonna be honest, the ""extended edition"" didn't add all that much to the game, so I guess currently, since it's an old game, it wouldn't be ""worth"" it's current full price, but if you can get it on sale and you're an RTS fan, this is definitely a good purchase."

I'm sick and tired of losing my games because of it happening on a nearly regular basis. My laptop runs it just fine in single and mutiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer the games lag is irratating sometimes to the point where its unplayable...The PROS- I'm happy that it was revived here on Steam because I lost the disc version a while back but never was able to find it again so I thought hey I wonder if Age of Mythology is available to play?? The gameplay is still as it was 19 years or so ago. That was unchanged, the graphics improved enough but stil kept the nostalgic feel.
