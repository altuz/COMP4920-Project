76561198024972696,Not Recommended,266940,16903950,"Posted: 5 July, 2015",all,DALCOhstangultion,"Unfortunately, I'm not recommending ""Alex Hunter - Lord of the Mind Platinum Edition.""  The game's got acceptable graphics for what it is.  But, it has enough gameplay issues that I just can't recommend it.  To wit:- This is supposedly a Hidden Object Game (HOG).   In a HOG, the non-HOG puzzles should be perception-based with some mild logic puzzles of putting together the pieces you have.  There are certainly HOGs in this game.  But, in general, the non-HOG puzzles are mostly what appear to be heavy logic puzzles.  In reality, they're really just brute force puzzles.  With a logic puzzle, you examine the situation, figure out the rules, and determine that the answer is X.  In these brute force puzzles, you can't do that.  The best you can do is look at the situation, figure out the rules, and optimize your moves to try to minimize the combinations you have to try before stumbling upon the answer that works.  Very frustrating in a HOG-type game.- The game will randomly re-activate HOGs you've already done, but give you no game-based reason to go back to that area and see that a HOG has re-activated.  The only way you figure it out is when you're stuck and either look at the map to see an old area now has something for you to do there, or wander back through all the accessible areas to see.- The story is even more filled with holes than the story in other HOGs.Yes.  I got about 8 hours of play out of the game.  But, the game is just not good enough to recommend.  I suppose if you can find it for a couple of dollars or in a heavily discounted bundle, you could try it.  Just be aware of the situation."

There is a variety of puzzles and Hidden Object parts so the game keeps moving at a nice pace like a book its a good page turner.  Some of the puzzles take ALOT of time to solve and many are very, very, very, difficult.  These difficult games can just be skipped, there are hints if you get stuck, and a guide.  A good game that you can stop playing anytime and come back to since the map screen has exclamation marks showing which areas have something to investigate.The visual look of the game is impressive, the scenes never feel dead, their alive with animals moving, instead of just a static image like other games.  The music is awesome, and this edition has a bonus feature that lets you rock out detective style.Rating:  9/10  Value:  $7.99"

Fortunately this game has nothing to do with the 'Maltese Falcon' or 'The Shadow' beyond that ""noire"" flare.  Takes place in the late 1800's, I estimate, from the crazy inventions and steam powered ""science"" which inspires today's steam punk.  (I really love the elevator.) Action/adventure/mystery all rolled into one.  Damsel in distress, rescue her father, stop the crazy ""mad"" scientist and save the world, what more could one ask for?Well executed linear storyline with just a place or two that feels ""padded"".  Mostly point and click, but enough hidden object scenes to still be an actual hidden object game.  Puzzles of various types and not all of them in the neat little game puzzle boxes.  Some of the more puzzling aspects of this game is simply trying to figure out how to do something, or just where an item is.  I must point out that I really liked the fact that if the player thinks they need a screwdriver, they really do need a screwdriver and not a coin or bobby pin or some other obsure, does not quite make sense item to solve something.  It simply becomes a matter of where is the screwdriver.  As far as actual designated puzzles I only remember one as being a down right frustration.  Since there is no penalty for skipping a single puzzle, I skipped after about 10 minutes of game time.  After I skipped I remembered there was a walkthrough and I could have looked up the solution. C'est la vive.I hope this becomes a series because I really like the character Alex Hunter.  He reminds me of Humphrey Bogart for some reason, that cynical, rather jaded overlook on life probably, or could just be the voice acting in the introduction.  Regardless I really would like to go through those previous cases involving fraud, theft, bribery, and murder.  Sounds like a good adventure to me.This game has those hidden/ghost/shape shifting objects so do not miss them, since the previous chapters lock so there is no going back.  There is a bonus chapter after finishing the main storyline, in game achievements, and accesible extras (wallpapers, production sketches).  Steam also has achievements and trading cards.All in all an excellent game, and I personally like the pregame music."
,Recommended,266940,15741470,"Posted: 8 May, 2015",all,Erika {C²},"I usually don't play these 'hidden object' games, but this one was a very relaxing and also a bit exciting.The storyline makes sense, some of the puzzle games were bit harder.There is also a bonus chapter. A bit longer than i expected, that's a very plus to this game.You can also use hint which takes you to place you need, to solve puzzle or find a hidden object.Moving around through the map is easy, so you just click the room where is point of interest and you don't have to walk through another 4 or 5 places.Finding hidden symbols is bit challenging :)If you are looking for a relax - don't hesitate to buy this game and solve the case, detective!"
,Recommended,266940,12229175,"Posted: 24 September, 2014",all,Mad Scientist,"I want to give this game 5 stars, intellectually.  It had the good HINTs/STRATEGY GUIDE (bundled).  It had a MAP feature to speed travel and show you were the next actionable locations were.  It had the JOURNAL system that auto recorded all the clues you had seen elsewhere in the game.  It had BONUS CONTENT (i.e. ""Secret Room"", Wallpapers, Audio Tracks) which unlocked when you found enough of the secret mysterious symbols throughout the game.  It had a reasonable plot (for a Hidden Objs genre game), good atmosphere/feel, and the Hidden Objects puzzles threw a few Aha moments at me.However, it felt like just before it hit excellence in most of those areas, it would fall slightly short, again and again.  It had a LOT of sliding piece puzzles, which I find personally annoying.  The plot didn't go far enough for me to get personally invested in it.  The arcade puzzles were interesting, but sloppily implimented ... so I'd have to replay because it was sometimes scoring hits as misses (shooting gallery), etc.  Overall it felt like things were being added from a master ""to do list"" of what games should have, instead of being organically grown out of the game itself.Missing/Broken Feature(s):* Achievements in Game (But no Steam Achievements)* I wish it had Steam collectible Cards, too.* Soundtracks in Extra Content section:  Only 1 of the tracks would play music (with LONG delay)Overall Rating:  4/5 Stars (even with all the bonus features)"
,Recommended,266940,10935569,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Flying Omelette,"So long as you limit yourself when it comes to hints and skipping puzzles, this is one of the best Hidden Object Games I've ever played. It certainly took me longer to finish than any of the Midnight Mysteries, Samantha Swift, or Clockwork Man games. My only caveat is that I'm not personally a huge fan of sliding tile puzzles and this game has several - some of which I managed to solve on my own and some of which I used the in-game hint book or the Skip button to pass. But if you like that sort of thing and like finding hidden objects and solving point-and-click puzzles, then this game is for you, especially if it's on sale. No Steam achievements, but the in-game achievements also give it a little replay value since you're not likely to get them all on your first try.Rating: 4/5"

My only real complaint is that even on the novice setting, the mini games/puzzles that you have to solve seem extremely hard. I like these games because you have to think a bit but it's usually nothing that I have to stress over and I rarely find myself having to skip the puzzles but with this one, for my own sanity, I skipped several of them. They seemed to be more guessing games than any real strategies and there were to many options to ever be able to guess correctly. Wasn't a fan of getting so frustrated to the point of not following through on the game entirely.But the storline and hidden object scenes and clue finding was entertaining enough that I kept going and plan on completing the game. It isn't worth $6.99 but as a $.49 or $.99 hidden object game, it was fun."

Some of the puzzles I just could not figure out and finally gave up and skipped it. I went back and played it again and was able to figure out a couple more. In order to not use the map to figure out what you need to do next, you have to really remember every place you've been. What is really nice is the bonus chapter is as involved as the regular game. It takes quite a bit of time to solve the bonus chapter; not a quick run through like some other games. If you play the game in the expert mode, you have to really search for all the secret signs in order to unlock the secret chamber. I've played it twice, once on regular mode and once in expert mode. I could not find all the signs in expert mode so couldn't unlock the secret room. I would hghly recommend this game. It is challenging. The graphics are great, and the music fades into the background as you play it. It is not jarring like some music."

,Recommended,266940,13564913,"Posted: 24 December, 2014",all,talgaby,"Short version: 77%Alex Hunter is a surprisingly long hidden object game with little story, decent puzzles and a nice soundtrack. Although it never really surpasses the mediocre level, the sheer length alone makes it stand out of similar games.Long version:Alex Hunter: Lord of the Mind is an average hidden object title in all aspects, except one: unlike most similar games it has a male protagonist.Not that it really matters, since the story– a missing person investigation leading into a James Bond-like “stop the evil genius from taking over the world” scenario– takes up about 5-10 minutes of game time. It is nothing more than an excuse to use a Victorian visual theme, a very carefully designed and implemented, excellent visual theme.The game is exceptionally long, thanks to the quite lengthy (although not particularly difficult) puzzles, the balanced hidden object scenes, and just the sheer number of places you can visit. It can easily clock over six hours even if one uses the map all the time to avoid the constant backtracking, making it an excellent choice if you want to have some game length for your money."

I play these sorts of games for the puzzles and consider the hidden object and inventory management as parts I just have to suffer through to get to the puzzles.  There is a fair variety in the types of puzzles, from jigsaw to sliders to logic, but some of them are less about thinking and more about making you try all the combinations until it works.There will be several rooms open at any given time and you will have to keep going between them to complete the objectives.  At first this was very confusing because there might be 10 things in the rooms that you need to do and you might have 10 things in your inventory, but none of those objects helps with the immediate tasks.  There is little to no direction in the ""story"" to tell you what you should be working on solving next and which things you don't have the objects for yet.  Then, I realized the map always shows which rooms have activities that can be completed.  It's a cop-out to use the map like this instead of having a better written game where it would make sense what you are supposed to do next.Along with not knowing what to do next, quite often a hidden object scene that you had previously completed will re-activate and have new things for you to find.  However, the game does not indicate in any way, except for the map, that you need to backtrack to that area.If you can get it on sale, it can be some fun for the puzzles, but overall it is a poorly done game."

There are a lot of mechanical short comings, and the story is hanging by a thread.Listen I would give this game a 6/10, but I have to give it a thumbs down here, because it is way over rated, and people like me who are fan of real puzzles are going to buy it expecting great things.

While nothing new or groundbreaking, and certainly suffering from the usual shortcomings (thinly justified story, awkward dialogue, etc.), Alex Hunter is polished, low on bugs, and keen to give both casual and hardcore players a good experience without resorting to different play parameters. Environments are generic but nice, HO segments are run-of-the-mill but light on confusing clue names, and the puzzles, mostly the usual mix, include a few fresh but accessible offerings. Environmental interactions also tend to be logical and context-driven, which many games don't enforce. After allowing for the earlier list, the game has only two major flaws. One is simply that there is almost no practical difference between the difficulty settings - for the higher, hints and skips take longer and all ""secret symbols"" must be found to unlock the Bonus Room (the symbols are spoon-fed and the BR is kind of a joke anyway) - but serious players can simply ignore the included map and spurn hints and skips to increase the challenge. The other is that, whether finding hidden objects or scouring an environment, cursor placement to activate objects and interactions (inluding the usual hand and magnifying glass indicators) must be so exact that even pixel-scouring tactics failed to reveal them on a couple of occasions, forcing the use of the hint button. But overall this is a perfectly good and enjoyable adventure game."

Interesting art style, 3D cutscenes, good puzzle variety, and two ways to play (casual and expert) plus a bonus chapter. It's a few hours of fun. I only wish there was a third difficulty option that removed the ""hint"" button so you're not tempted to use it every 1-2 minutes, or use it to solve any puzzle."

I actually had to skip four or five puzzles cause I ran out of patience and they were really annoying. It took me nearly 8hrs including the bonus chapter. I also used the map to jump around which cost me an achievement but I hate going back and forth without it.Hidden puzzles are also challenging, definitely worth the money."

,Recommended,266940,33664781,Posted: 19 July,all,Impracticalmagic,"This game is well-worth adding to any HOG/casual adventure collection.  It had good length, nice art, an interesting setting (especially for fans of old-style mysteries), and reasonably well-balanced puzzles.   A solid 8/10 for me."
