In some levels, you just point at the first orb thing and the game plays itself. However, in other levels, it takes you ten hours to find the exactly perfect position. Fun mechanic and graphics ruined by terrible level design."

That being said, I still regret this purchase. It isn't even worth a quarter.Some say it's like Angry Birds Space. It's not. It's far, far worse. I love Angry Birds, and this game is nothing like it. You can't destroy anything. The whole point of the game is to grab three coin star things, then get to the warp hole/exit. It's not really an enjoyable process either. Many of the levels you can get immediately, because they're so easy. Some others are so annoyingly hard to find the sweet spot. It's basically just tweaking your shot, little bit little, trying to find that one sweet spot where you win the level. It's barely even a game really. More like a meticulous painful process of guess work.The camera is annoying. It starts zoomed in, and as you pull the mouse back to launch, if you tough the edge of the screen, it zooms out more. Most levels require zooming out, and every time you restart, it zooms back in. This means you have to use the annoying edge zoom EVERY time you try again. It's aggrivating.It DESPERATELY needs a restart button, like the ""R"" key or something. You do get three lives, but it's pointless, because you obviously want to get three stars. So you end up clicking pause, then reset, then resetting the annoying camera again... over, and over, and over, and over... until you find that one sweet spot where it works.On top of all that, it's a physics gravity type game, and the physics don't even really make too much sense. Sometimes a planet will do a lot, sometimes barely anything. The size appears to be important at times, and totally irrelevant other times.I've played the game about an hour as of now (to get all the badges... not because it's good). I'm about half way through the game. There's a badge where you have to play the game 10 hours... there's no way this is a ten hour game. I'm just going to be leaving it on while I do other things, for the sake of getting that badge.If I were you, the only way I would get this game is if it were free, so that I could get the trading cards and sell them."

NOT worth the full $5.4/10The game has a cute look and feel with anthropomorphic badgers flying around in space suits.Music is good and fitting for the setting of space flight.The game falls apart in the gameplay:- When levels aren't stupifyingly simple (aim at the nearest star at max power and instantly win with 3 stars), it's being mindlessly tedious (knowing what to do to win, but trying to find the perfect sweet spot to get 3 stars on first try. This takes no thought or strategy and is mostly just memorizing your last move and using trial and error at its most pointless).- Unlocking new characters is fun, but they all do the same thing. This is a missed opportunity for puzzle solving: Give each badger an ability like boosting in mid flight, igonring a certain color planet's gravity, or can fly through asteroids, etc.- I've got nothing against Angry Birds, but when you launch a bird in that game the terrain changes, making you adjust for your next shot. With this game, if you know where the winning sweet spot is, you win instantly. This kills replayability and makes the game more of a guessing-chore and less of a game."

,Not Recommended,267060,10953677,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Kreegath,"Gravity Badgers is your typical mobile game ported to PC. It's riddled with questionable game design choices, graphical glitches and gameplay bugs, making the overall experience playing it lacking at best. There are only two situations where I would give a luke warm recommendation that you pick this one up, both hinging on it being on sale for 50% or more: Either because you *really* enjoy these types of games, or you want a quick and easy way to hunt for achievements.Concerning the aforementioned game design decisions, you will be pixel hunting every level in order to get the pathing of your badgers the way you want. This might sound like stating the obvious intention of the game, but let me assure you that in actuality this will become an exercise in frustration and nothing else. You will almost always directly see precisely what you need to do, but will be unable to get your badger to actually fly the way it should. So the game quickly devolves into picking a pixel in the background as a landmark, then moving your pointer a pixel at a time in relation to it until you hit the exactly right spot. It's not fun, basically.Also, the developer put little to no effort into ramping up the difficulty or pacing it throughout the game. Instead, you have one or two roadblocks per chapter, with ridiculously easy levels inbetween. I'm literally talking ""Shoot max speed straight ahead""-level difficulty for the majority of the game. It makes the experience very uneven.Finally, the camera ruins more attempts than anything else. What I mean is that the camera will automatically scroll out when you hold to increase acceleration on your badger, in theory, but it doesn't work like that in practice. Sometimes you have to jerk the mouse pointer back and forward from the game window to scroll out in increments, sometimes you scroll out when you don't want to even if you're almost in the middle of the screen, and sometimes you have to jerk the mouse pointer towards every corner of the window to find the one spot the game deem to be the right for scrolling out. This might sound like a really insignificant point against ""Gravity Badgers"", but remember that you use the background stars and nebulas for reference, so you'd either want to scroll out as much as you can or not at all. Once you've discovered the correct spot and acceleration to finish the level, you will still need to start every attempt moving your mouse over the window back and forth, which, as you can imagine, gets old in a hurry.In regards to the graphical glitches and bugs, you'll sometimes think you're aiming one way at a certain acceleration, but once you let your badger fly he'll go in a completely different direction or at a different speed. You will also notice on the boss levels, how sometimes the boss will shoot more often or more seldom than it should, not as an intended thing and not in any way consistent. Moving platforms will also cause problems, as their hitboxes will vary widely for no apparent reason. You'll brush one platform at one time and pass right through it, and another time you'll be visibly separate from it and still get sucked in. Again, with no consistency.Also, you can abuse the pause button for great effect, as projectiles will still move in the background. Missed a platform on a boss? No problem, just pause and wait for the next one to move into you so you can unpause and continue as if nothing had happened.""Gravity Badgers"" feels like either a quickly put together Flash game, or a mobile game port. It's not worth its price or your time, unless of course you buy it on a sale for the easy achievements. It takes *at most* 15 hours to finish."
