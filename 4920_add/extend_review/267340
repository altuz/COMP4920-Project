This toilets cabin makes him so alive, and yet we never see the guy ! Now, imagine that all the 'towers' you put in the fields are alive too... Man, this ambiance is soooo fun ! It's actually a part of the machine, but it's also its eyes. It's a vent, but it's also its mouth. Just love the design of these characters/machines ! Mobs have suits, costumes, cohesive animations, and their abilities are related to their appearance. You could guess what it can or cannot do by just looking at them. It's very pleasant and made me feel like I was watching a good old cartoon from Tex Avery/Hanna Barbera. So alive !Then came the game... I really don't like Tower Defense game type. BPE is the first one I DO want to complete ! God, I felt entertained all time long ! The first levels were clearly designed as tutorials. That's why all the people who got used to play TDs may be bored, but I think their experience will allow them to complete these levels very fast, to finally get to...... THE ZAPPER !Here is how you can turn a simple TD into a frenetic game experience : developpers managed to give you this intense feeling of being overwhelmed, without simply adding mobs, and mobs, and a new wave of mobs... The ZAPPER ! They also played on mobs' resistance, and finally managed to balance mobs' speed, defense, zapper's power, machines' utility and player's actions so that you have a lot of things to setup, manage and use... but in a very effective way ! Everything is damn simple to understand and use, and provides a lot of fun ! Don't... forget... to use... the ZAPPER ! It's your best ally all game long !And finally, a new dimension came to my attention: mobs' transformations ! You think you killed it, it turns into something else ! Hard Rockers turn into ""Berserk Hard Rockers"", Zombies turn into graves, where new smaller zombies emerge, ... but I won't spoil everything ^_^ I found these game mechanics very inventive !A lot of TDs should take example on this game. It's simple, yet effective and terribly addictive, fun and easy to play, and includes a very well balanced challenge.I should have given feedback on the 'charismatic' fields, or on the growing number of aliens' spawn points as you progress in the game, or maybe on the evolutive environment (mushrooms and their spores, ice forming on your machines during winter and the zapper's utility at this moment of the game,...), and maybe I should have told you about the bosses, the drill, the gears or the cow bell... but I really have nothing to say about it, because everything was part of the fun, and very well thought !Play this game, it really worths its price !"

Well on earth, tehcnically xDDon't be fooled by all those colours: there is actually quite a bit of depth poured into the gameplay, and the zapper makes sure you basically never sit idle (on the contrary, you must constantly decide if/what to boost or explode), and that's where it differs from many other TD's (and from PvZ, specifically): apart from building towers and picking up ressources, you are always active with what is basically a multi-tool, there's not much waiting involved.Veteran mode is also quite handy, and I'd recommand tower denfense... veterans ^^ to actually enable it. I'd even say it's worth to turn it on from start. You won't get to make many mistakes and get away with it, but the difficulty isn't offputting either, and as long as your strategy is sound, you shouldn't get stuck wondering what went wrong. ""Normal"" difficulty I didn't try so I can't really comment, but it sounds nice to be able to play with less focus, or to enable less-hardcore players to fully enjoy the game I guess. Plus, you can always switch between Normal/Vet with the flick of a button apparently.There's a whole bunch of animations, graphics, easter eggs, you name it. You get everything from ninjas, to secret agents reading news papers unsuspectingly, to Martian ladies filing their nails and cleaning up the alleys :DGameplay wise, there's something I found rather odd at first for a TD: compared to mostly every other TD I ever played, the maps are rather small, and towers have very limited range (basically just 3 squares). I was afraid of that at first, but it turns out that it just makes you think about placement and synergy even more, instead of just spamming long ranged OP towers everywhere like in some other TDs. Speaking of which : the game starts slow, but it's kind of a tutorial even though it doesn't officially says so. You gotta hang in there for the first 4 or 5 levels, but after that you get the zapper and get to occupy yourself with it, and start seeing more diversity towers-wise.All in all, much more fun that some random movie, at the price of a movie theater ticket ;p"
,Recommended,267340,9798218,"Posted: 12 April, 2014",all,Cabi,"At first the game starts pretty slow, but the pace really cranks up a notch after the ""tutorial"" levels. Everything's explained in great detail (maybe too much for some people?), but after those explanations, the fun really begins and boy does it get hectic at times!The main originality is the ""zapper"" (a raygun you get at level 6 I think), and it's used pretty much everywhere: you can shoot down creeps with it (although it's quite weak compared to your actual towers and traps, and it breaks down if it overheats, so you have to manage that too), and you have lots of interactions. For example, quite early in the game, you have G-men like martians that your towers can't detect until you blow his cover with the raygun. You can also zap away the forcefields the mad scientists cast around other martians.It really adds a great deal of action to the game, it's unlike any other tower defense game I've played so far (in which you basically deploy your towers and wait for them to do the job until you get enough money to put some more).The graphics are cute and really fun and the music is cool too. It look like PopCap's ""Plants versus Zombies"" and is every bit as good (although quite different when you get far enough in the game).The demo is good but don't be fooled: the learning/difficulty curve is actually smoother in the game (although the beginning is still quite slow). Oh also, you have two difficulty modes: normal and veteran. Normal is pretty easy, Veteran is the opposite and will have you yell at your computer, only to come back for more right away :p"

It will appeal to casual players who want to see cute / funny things on the screen (think plants vs zombies crowd) and also to the players who want depth of strategy (think defence grid players). I have finally found a game that will appeal to both me and the girlfriend. Easy buy after playing the demo. Try it. I bet you'll like it.And don't let the laser gun turn you off, like it did me at first. I thought it was just a tedious laser to shoot stuff with while trying to build defences etc. But it actually adds a layer of strategy, as it doesn't just damage the bad guys, it does things like lower shields and other status changes, and supercharges particular towers."

And in the end this game was not for me.I get the fact that people are trying to reinvent the TD genre, but honestly, isn't designing a solid TD hard enough? Usually, when features are added the towers are left behind. Beware planet earth is a good example of this. Towers are lackluster and their range is minute. If you like frantically clicking in a TD then this game is definately for you. If you are an oldschool TD player, who likes to sit back at the end of a level and see waves pulverized by a well designed tower setup, you might want to pass on this game."

Cows!This is totally not my type of game, but the demo was so entertaining that I just had to put it on my wishlist, and then get it when I saw it on sale for 1.99 euro. It's well worth more than that (and I'm stingy). The graphics and humour hits the right spot for me.It was great fun until I tried to get those stupid achievements, then it turned into frustrating no fun on the Veteran play through of Winter level 5. After far too many attempts on the previous levels each time until I got lucky, too. (Achievements only ever get in the way of enjoying a game for me, and this game was where I finally decided to say 'screw them all'. I'd really like a button in Steam to turn them all off.)Back to just playing for the fun (screw veteran), it's entertaining me still, replaying the levels in order and the challenge and bonus ones I like.There are plenty of levels, hours upon hours of play time! The progression is good, starts easy and gets slowly more difficult.There are some different types of challenge levels throughout the Story mode, where I would like to just skip the one that I find no fun at all (Maid Raid), and get more of the one I like best (Back to Basics). They each unlock a few more levels of the same type once you've beaten the one in the Story mode, which is nice. There are also bonus levels where the aliens and playing area look different, and some have somewhat different special abilities (with no way that I know to read up details about them, unfortunately).I'd have liked a way to re-check the aliens while playing in a normal level, too. My memory isn't the best anymore.And I'd have liked a way to go to the next level in a second play through, rather than having to go back to the main menu and pick a previously played level just to get to the one after the one I just played.And I'd much prefer the game to remember that I unticked Fullscreen, rather than having to do it again every time I launch it.But overall, great fun. Try the free demo, it has 7 or so levels from different spots in the story mode, so you get to see easy and somewhat tougher levels in shorter time, giving you a good idea of what to expect in the full version."

Towers are overall very boring, the first 5 you get (compared to Plants vs Zombies): Sunflower, Incredibly Weak PeaShooter, Frozen Pea Shooter, and then you get the two worst, a Bomb and a Landmine. I keep waiting to unlock good towers but the only ones I've gotten are an Ember-shooting Grill and a Fire Hose. Everything else makes me want to wait till the next good thing comes along.

I will at least give it a shot.My low expectations were blown out of the water after playing the demo. I grabbed the game at full price, which is something I very rarely do, and have now beaten it and all the bonus levels. If Plants versus Zombies and Defense Grid had a love child, this is that game. Do not let the cute graphics fool you, the aliens will hand you your butt on a platter if you do not plan carefully. I have played and beaten a variety of tower defense games, but this one still challenged me.On top of actually requiring you to use deft strategy, you are never left sitting and watching the screen as your towers do everything for you. Early in the game, you are given a zapper gun that you must use to help fight off the aliens. If you do no use it, the aliens WILL beat you. Unlike other tower defense games you have to actively participate the in the action every second of the stages. The aliens can disable your towers, get rid of your traps, and even destroy your defenses if you do not use the zapper wisely to counter their offensive.The only thing that holds the game back from getting a perfect score from me is that there are a slew of game closing bugs during the extra missions.  There are also a couple of sections (particularly with the Maid challenge they throw at you) that take the game from being challenged to downright frustrating since you have to feel out the strategy that the developers want you to use through trial and error rather than make one of your own.I have to give this game 4.5 out of 5."

The first 10 levels or so are fun and enjoyable, just like the first 10 beers at a party. And then something happens and the game just stops being fun and becomes annoying, just like the 12th-20th beer at a party. Then you hit that wall and just wonder what's the point, like trying to consume that 30th beer so you do not have a lone survivor to haul home and be lonely in your fridge.Not saying to buy it, but not saying don't buy it. It is fun at first and then it changes, like the devil herself is in control."

A bit too much of a click fest for me, but that's probably because I'm not that good at that part of the game.Certainly challenging enough, after the first approximately ten levels I had to adjust the difficulty from veteran to normal.Well worth the money, lots of levels and some fun bonus levels."

,Not Recommended,267340,10056485,"Posted: 8 May, 2014",all,Yiasmat,"(07/10) - Nicely ExecutedIt is a great TD, tho my standarts for that genre are sky-high, as it´s one of my favourite.It has brilliant ideas of how to mix things up a little, looks very nice and has good designs meaning you can´t rely on building the same tower against every enemy and sit back.For everyone not being a super-fan of this genre: stop reading here and buy this game if you are interested in TD´s. For everyone else:The reason why i can´t recommend it is it´s difficulty. There are two modes: non-veteran and veteran.I played on veteran ofcourse, as i think TD´s are usually way too easy and still have no problems in them while most people scream out loud that they can´t beat it.Well, my part i guess...I´m not saying it´s unbeatable, but it is so rediciulously hard to save all the cows (lives), i´ve never seen anything like it.After (only!!!) 1/4 of the story, it get´s from having-to-play-a-level-twice-to-save-all-cows to impossible. I tried the same level over 100 times, using all strategies i could imagine with the towers i unlocked till then and i didn´t even come close to my goal.As i said, it´s a really nice TD, but if you´re not looking for antoher pre-patch inferno of diablo 3, i´d advice to play another TD..."

More than once.As Tower D goes, there are worse games.The cartoony style is actually amusing for longer than one level.Cons:Couldn't play it more than once.As Tower D goes, there are many better games.The gameplay philosophy seems to be they enjoyed that, let's give them more of it. Also, we have nothing else.No distinguishing features, no real story-telling, but if you need to kill an hour or so... you could do better with ten bucks."

There was a point towards then end of story mode where I was a bit sick of the new types of martians and ""towers"" but it's hard to fault a game for having more content.  It does feel longer than it needed to be and a little drawn out"
