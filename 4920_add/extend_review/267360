Yes it does! The HUD looks just like it was ripped from a DOS-Jump'n'Run. The sound is just like in the DOS-era. And the graphics and the overall look remind me of games like DUKE NUKEM and COMMANDER KEEN. But is the game any good? It'S a blast. A lot of secrets and weapons want to be found and the level design is really good. If you're looking for a game that puts you right back in the DOS-era this is the perfect game for you.

This one nails the look and feel of those games, combining the color schemes of CGA and EGA graphics (with perhaps some subtle liberties taken).  There's no save feature, but the game is pretty short and you can pick which episode to start from anyway.  No music aside from the title screen, either, but we can let this slide.  Good one to pick up on sale."

Good level design, nice feel to the combat, varied enemies. The audio design is meh (doesn't have any music either) and I find the lack of online integration for leaderboards to be a strange decision, seeing how it would've helped grow the community and given the game more replay value, but it's nothing too bad.As someone who's too young to get a huge nostalgia stiffy out of this one: Best 40 cents I've spent in a while.

This goes beyond simply the pixel art craze, it's spot on in art style, sound effects, color palette, gameplay, hidden areas, even the menus and episode selection.The gameplay is immediately familiar and nostalgic for those who grew up on these games. Strongly inspired by and reminiscent of games like Commander Keen, Crystal Caves, Duke Nukem I and II, Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure, Monster Bash, etc.Highly recommended if you enjoy the genre and have any fondness for games of that period."

Unfortunately, once that's over there's no reason to go back - no achievements, no custom levels, no community features such as leaderboards.If you can get it during a sale or in a bundle, by all means go for it - buying it at full price, though, is something you might want to think twice about.EDITED: All right, so it turns out I've missed two things: there is one additional secret area with a hint regarding a bonus boss, and the boss itself - not so much difficult to beat as difficult to get to. If you're a completionist, that's an extra 1-2 hours of gameplay on highest difficulty."

There just weren't that many options in the 16-color EGA era; Apogee and id Games, primarily. Still, the four-directional (if a bit clunky) scrolling and rich diorama-like scenery provided an experience unlike the console platformers of the time.MURI captures the feeling of that era without its missteps; Daniel Remar puts all his skill at well-designed levels full of secrets and gigantic boss battles here. The player character's slowness and limited set of movements doesn't feel unfair, and the enemies are challenging despite their own constraints.The game is definitely short, about an hour from start to finish. Like most Remar games, the true replay value is in trying to get the highest score at the highest difficulties, a challenge once again relevant in the Let's Play decade."

The game is a side scrolling platformer with awesome platforming controls a rarity on PC.  Works fine on a controller with awesome retro sound effects.  I thought the game was old, but its very clever, its a new game made to look like an old game and it does this 100% awesome.  While not long its a good ride with simple controls that work making it easy to pick up and play anytime.  This game is made more awesome by having lingonberries in it if you ""Activate Sweden"".

,Recommended,267360,8000032,"Posted: 10 December, 2013",all,Magnetick,"My thoughts on MURI are pretty mixed. It's a fun platformer, but it's so short. I like how a game wouldn't want to over stay it's welcome or anything, but it can be beaten in under an hour. The game feels like Duke Nukem 1 (A 2D platformer) with less flaws. The problem is, is that it sticks too close to the same type of gameplay the whole game. You are never really surprised the whole game. It always plays it safe and never really deviates from the base structure. The game has some level design, but it's all a bit generic. If you are a fan of 90's PC games like Duke Nukem 1 or even Commander Keen and Duke Nukem 2, you should buy this. The games biggest flaw is that it feels too much like a 90's game, you could tell someone it's ""The lost Apogee game"" and they would believe it, there isn't much replay value (aside from tougher difficulties), and there isn't much variety. There aren't many modern features, I mean, there isn't any coop or anything. The graphics are alright, it looks like I could be running an old DOS game, and is pretty nice by those standards.Well, overall, I may of sounded a bit disparaging on this, and I may of spent a lot of text talking about MURI's flaws, but it is a fun game which I really enjoyed while it lasted. I'm sure I'll buy the next game the dev makes, the dev has some talent. MURI is not the perfect game, but if you are a platformer fan who has three bucks to spare... Why not give it a shot? You know what, 7.5 out of 10 stars. I'd recommend it.EDIT: Changed score from 6.5 since it didn't seem too fair. I'm playing it again and it's definately a 7.5. It's very enjoyable even with it's simplicity."

It's been released with very little fanfare, but I would recommend this to just about anyone who likes action games."
76561198123412640,Recommended,267360,12783660,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,Sam Lilly,"MURI is a pretty fun little game. It's short, simple, and to the point. 2D platforming and shooting. This game replicates old DOS games. I never really played anything on DOS when I was younger, but I've played NES games and retroactively played a few select DOS titles. So as long as you're into retro style games, you'll probably enjoy this.This game controls pretty well. You only have a few functions, but it's pretty easy and smooth... and I even played on the choppy authentic settings. You jump, duck, and shoot your way through the levels collecting items for points. The game is even nice enough to tell you once you've got all the items in an area, so you'll know for sure if you found all the secret spots or not. Also, it's worh mentioning that your jump is actually responsive to how long you hold the jump button and the rate of ascent and descent is the same. It might not sound like much, but it makes the game very easy to control compared to some stiffer titles of the past. Also, you can get a small variet of cool weapons, each one stronger than the last. There are four episodes and five levels per episode, making the game 20 levels long. It took me about two hours to beat the whole thing 100% the first time I played.The retro style is done very well in this game. Where some games blend different retro references for nostalgia, MURI really sticks to a fully classic experience. Gameplay, music, sounds, visuals... the works. It's all done in a way that makes you believe it really could be an old DOS game. I love it. The classic feel AND mentality are in tact.As much as I enjoyed the game, there are a few issues, as with every game. One of them is that... well... it's short. The content that's there is good so I can't complain too much, but a lot of people will be offput by the brevity. The next two things I'm lumping together and you'll see why. No saving and no switching weapons. Both of these things would be very easy to put in. The thing is... they are a choice. Obviouly a game that came out in 2013 COULD have a button for saving and a button to change weapons, but it doesn't. These choices were made to give meaning to the extra lives and weapons you find. Sure, saving after every level would be convenient, but it would defeat the purpose of getting extra lives by reloading every level if you mess up. Plus, the episodes are pretty short, only took me roughly 30 minutes each and it was my first time playing... got 100% score on them all... you'll have plenty of time to beat an episode and each episode starts you with nothing anyway so it's the same as having a save between episodes really. Switching weapons would make you stock up on ammo to beat tough bosses and enemies rather than conserve your ammo and take careful shots with the guns you acquire. These choices are not only for a retro feel, but they also make sense for the game's difficulty. They're design choices... so I can't be too upset about them.Overall, it's a pretty fun little game akin to the first two Duke Nukem games. If you like retro style games of the 2D platformer shooter genre, check it out. Is it worth the $6 asking price? $4 isn't too bad. It could be a little cheaper, and you can always wait for a sale, but if you're up for trying out the difficulties and replaying it a few times after you've bought it rather than making it just a one time deal, then it's a fair price. I got it on sale for 40 cents so it was well worth it for me. Maybe wait for it to go on sale if you're skeptical, but just don't forget about it. It's a decent little title without all the frills of achievements to intimidate you along the way. I like it."

She is one of the creators of the MURI suit which is like a suit made to absorb life forms. After a failed missions it's up to us to restore balance in the world. So how is MURI ? All i can say this is a must play for any DOS game fans. This feels a lot more polished than the classic DOS games like Duke Nukem. The game is a platformer in which you start at point A and you need to get to point B.  MURI has outstanding level design and it's overall a really well made game. The game is also quite short only around an hour long. Overall there's not a lot to say about this game. It's a really fun and a well made game. The only gripes i have with the game is that it's too short. I would have loved more levels. But overall MURI is a must play and with the price tag it's a must buy. I give MURI a 7.5/10

Specifically, it looks and plays a lot like the original Duke Nukem from 1991, but it has a lot of cool features of its own.If you haven't played the original Duke, you're given about 16 decently sized levels you're free to wander around and explore in, grabbing stuff for points, getting better firepower, and looking around for secrets.The game's pretty short, but each episode comes with a boss fight that gets tougher and more interesting the harder the difficulty you play it on. There's also always the drive to improve your score by looking for more of the secrets and getting better times, too, which is cool if you're into score attacking.Personally, I like this game just for how authentic it is. Nothing in the game uses 16 colors, and even the sound effects come right out of the PC speaker. For some people, it might be a little tough to look at, but for somebody who grew up with DOS, it's a lot of extra effort that I feel makes the game really special. Not many games at all have ever used this kind of style, compared to how many NES-style games are out there, so I really, really appreciate it. Here's hoping for DLC, or better yet, a sequel."
,Recommended,267360,7973136,"Posted: 8 December, 2013",all,DCT,"This game, this game is just so amazing. So many times when you see ""retro"" style games they are usually either throwbacks to old NES/SNES/Megadrive(Genesis) era games or a lazy excuse for weak graphics since they may look like a old game graphiclly but they don't often play like them. This game on the other hand looks and plays like a old dos era EGA platformer, most notably Duke Nukem 1 so much so I half expected to see the Apogee logo and a shareware registration page which sadly it doesn't have but it does have a quit to DOS option(no seriously, but sadly no Simulated DOS prompt pops up when exiting) and it even uses old PC speaker style sound and music(title screen), so when I say looks and feels like I do mean it, the scrolling is a bit chunky since back in the day smooth scrolling effects were done on the PC through moving 8x8 blocks to simulated smooth movement like arcade and NES games had.Only downside it's a bit short since each episode is only 5 levels long and they could tweak the controlls a bit since if your shooting and then push back you don't turn but rather just move back unlike other games from the era it's emulating where you will always face the direction you press shooting or not. Prehapes this is intentional but it's still feels weird at least to me also there are no saves but since each episoded(4 in total) are only 5 levels long it's not a big deal.So if you have fond memories of old shareware EGA side-scrollers from the 90's like Duke Nukem, Commander Keen, Bio Menece, Dangerous Dave and the haunted mansion and others then by all means give this a go."

It's also the name of the highest difficulty setting in the game. But it's not one of those ultra-hard platformers. Instead, it's just a small and well made package.There are 4 episodes of 5 levels each. I couldn't tell you the story because I skipped through it.What I enjoyedNon-linear levels that encourage exploring everywhere for pickups and secrets.Simple, useful weapon upgrades.Good difficulty curve.The player character is a reluctant middle-aged, slightly overweight woman in a power suit. Sure, why not?Boss battles that aren't annoying.EGA look with some modern options for convenience. Make sure to set for graphics upscaling and smooth 32-bit scrolling.Oooh it does this thing where if you're facing left/right and you shoot in that direction and while shooting you move in the other direction, you walk backwards while maintaining your aim. Very handy!What I didn't likeMy biggest gripe is not being able to change keyboard controls. It comes with several schemes, but none suit me.Can't save. You can select which episode to play, but you'll have to repeat the levels if you'd previously stopped in the middle of it.

Remar has created something special here and I was nothing to short of being blown away. MURI is a side scrolling run and gun in the guise of an MS DOS aesthetic (seriously, as soon as I saw that DOS style HUD, I knew I was in for a treat) with plenty of things to shoot, plenty of power ups, plenty of levels, a ton of secrets and a phenomenal storyline. MURI is divided into four chapters and does a brilliant job of combining Sci-Fi elements into it's own unique telling, it's simply not enough to explain it here, I alone can do this game no justice. MURI is a special game, that does everything right, the MS DOS feel and aesthetic is beyond perfect, the story is original, the sound effects and what little music there is, is spot on. The game starts off easy, but it really does start getting brutal as it goes on... And theres a hard mode option, if you're feeling brave enough.MURI gets zero complaints from me, it's an outstanding game that caught me completely off guard, and it's an experience I would happily share with anyone who is interested. To anyone who  is into the DOS scene, to anyone who misses the unique feel of these types of games, you have to try this. Great game, if all my fingers were thumbs, they would be up, but they're not.

You could list out dozens of classic DOS games that Muri is like but it bares the strongest resembalence to the original Duke Nukum even to the point of having nearly identical assets at times.Where Muri fails at its emulaiton of Duke is its lack of puzzles to progress, most levels can just be run through without fighting enemies (if you dodge their attacks) and rarely do you ever encounter anything more than a few tricky platforming sections. The Challenge of Muri comes from its unforgiving combat and sheer number of enemies. I don't particularly care for that aspect of the game so I played on an easier difficulty and just enjoyed the nostalgic gameplay.Where Muri wins majorly is its secrets, it has TONS of hidden areas and secret items throughout the levels which  allow you access to special weapons at the boss fights.

Very much recommended even with it's short length. Addendum: LIKE SO MANY OTHER OLD DOS GAMES IT HAS A CHRISTMAS MODE THAT ACTIVATES AROUND CHRISTMAS BEST GAME EVER!!!"

I also really liked some weapons.The last stage is harder than the rest though, and you'll want to play it cautiously, since it is actually really easy to not lose a life in the first three stages.But it has some trading cards and, if you buy it in a promo, the cards will pretty much cover the game's price, so there's also that."

Minimalist and spartan it creates atmosphere with empty space, both visually and aurally, and succeeds in crafting a smooth dificulty curve through deliberate level design and the sequential introduction of new challenges and power-ups. The cherry on top is the surprisingly touching story told through tight dialogue scenes that don't overstay their welcome and explore themes of motherhood and sacrifice.It's a short game, approximately an hour and a half long, but once you start it, it's hard to put it down, and if you have fond memories of shareware and floppy disks its presentation will absolutely satisfy. Game design has matured over the decades and it avoids the pitfalls that its forebears often succumbed to, and I would argue that it succeeds as an engrossing experience even without being viewed through the lens of nostalgia."

The lack of a save point can be annoying to some modern players and the game could of benefited with some music to add a little more atmosphere, but overall this is a little great gameSo you grew up in the '90s, right? Played a lot of Commander Keen, Biomenace, Duke Nukem (the first two) and all sorts of other two-dimensional platformers? Or at least you're hip and nerdy enough to honestly appreciate those kind of games?Well, here's your chance to relive that particular place in time and space with a new adventure! Play MURI for ten seconds and you'll be thrown back immediately (actually you don't even need those ten seconds - just look at the intro screen and listen to the theme music), and ever now and then you get surprised by some more modern contraptions. The level design is fun and does the one thing right that so many games do wrong nowadays: you can fully backtrack every part of the level at your own pace and leisure to get all those hidden secrets and goodies. Yet the enemies are the most interesting part of this short little hommage to the oldschool platforming era. They're quite original in design and behaviour and they fit the weird SciFi storyline perfectly imho. Get this game (especially when it's on sale, it can get as low as €0.39) and enjoy your one or two hours of well executed retro fun. I know for sure I did."

However, if hunting for collectable floppy disks and super weapons behind false walls in a robot bunny suit sounds like your idea of a non-productive Saturday afternoon, you can do worse than this game.Breaking up the action is a series of incomprehensible story segments with all the narrative finesse of an Iji, or a... you know what, I don't think I've found a video game story quite as ham-handed and inconsequential as Iji's. But MURI's certainly tries, in spite of its greatly reduced length. You may also find some replay value in the more crippling difficulty levels or gunning for the optimal score per level with a system that rewards both complete enemy destruction and minimum time elapsed. Because that's a point of pride among connisseurs of budget-priced, niche-retro-era-styled, other-gratuitously-hypenated-descriptors downloadable games.

I expect replay value to be somewhat low overall.There's a decent variety of enemies you encounter and slay along the way and the boss fights, while not particularly challenging or extraordinary, are still frantic and fun to blast through. There is also a variety of weapon upgrades and power-ups you may encounter, ranging from rapid-fire to lazer blasts that ricochet off the walls.The levels are not linear however they are still easy to navigate through and they're designed quite well, though they all kind of feel the same.

Four episodes, with four levels (plus a boss level) in each, and I did it in around 2 hours. For the price, though, I'm not going to complain, because it plays very well.It's EXTREMELY reminiscent of the first Duke Nukem game. Fortunately, I like that game, so I like this too. The main difference with Duke Nukem is the addition of weapons, but other than that, the engine is almost identical (it could almost be a sequel to Duke Nukem, although that already exists). If you take Duke Nukem, mix in some Metroid style, and lowered your character's gravity so you can jump really high, that's this game.The design is excellent: the weapons are varied, and you can't select them freely so you never feel like relying on any one weapon. On Normal mode, I felt that just as my health was getting low, a health pack would appear, so the levels have been designed well there. I also like the secret rooms to find, and a challenge to get 100% on the level. The addition of cells that open doors to power-ups on the boss level is a nice touch: you can ignore them, but the final battle will be harder, so it keeps you searching.There are only a couple of negatives I can think of: there is no save function, which is odd for a game like this, but since each episode is done in around 20 minutes, it doesn't really bother me much. Second, I know the graphics and sound are supposed to be like an EGA game with PC speaker, but the music is just a rather dull theme song, then nothing. And the final negative? Not enough levels!

MURI has many differences that make it its own game.First, the protagonist is a chubby Martian chick. Second, you can't save, although the episodes aren't very long so it's not a big deal. Finally, the controls don't feel nearly as solid as good ol' Duke: jumping is very weird and takes some getting used to, since you have to hold the key to reach maximum height. It feels more like a limited flight, and if MURI had a jetpack it would make sense. But I guess on Mars you can somehow jump around corners. However once you get used to it, it works pretty well.Overall it doesn't feel nearly as sold as the original Duke Nukem, which is a little disappointing.

This is a game that emulates the style almost perfectly, right down to score collectibles, stage layouts, and even an optional 16 frames per-second gameplay mode. It's a simple little run and gunner with 20 stages that you'll probably end up blasting through in a relatively short amount of time (since the stages are in no way as labyrinthine or exhausting as some of those older games could get), but you'll either appreciate the call back to those gems of the past or understand the earlier days of PC gaming just a bit more.If the game does have one standout feature, it's that its story, simple as it is, has a bit more structure and presence than older games, and even has a fairly satisfying conclusion.It's hard to really not recommend MURI. It's a great little one-sitting action platformer that hits all the right notes and doesn't really outstay its welcome, nor does it feel like a chore to play with its slavish emulation of games from a time when technology was a lot more limited."

76561197983662248,Recommended,267360,11322224,"Posted: 19 July, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often times made the reviews a bit too long, I've left it on my Backloggery page. Even though I don't think that'll be an issue for this game, I feel compelled to point that out anyways. Besides, it's worked fine so far.Gameplay: If you've never played a DOS-style shooter before, think something like the original Contra but with more maze-y levels. If you have played a DOS-style shooter, this is pretty much par for the course. The stages are labyrinthean with plenty of secrets; some of which are pretty easy to spot while others require you to dig deeper into the level for something like a switch that activates something at the beginning of the level. I got an average of 95% of the points for each of the levels, with the exception of the boss levels, but that's just because of how the game scores points. There's four episodes which consist of five levels a piece; four stages and a boss stage. Hidden somewhere in the first four stages of each episode are items called cells which allow you to get some extra powerups before the boss of that stage. They're not essential, but they certainly do help.Bosses in this game are actually really good; certainly a lot better than some of the bosses you'd see in the Commander Keen series. I only played through the game on Normal, but even on that difficulty they were a bit of a handful. The final boss was just plain excellent and a great way to end the game. As for the weapons, you have your standard pea shooter, a rapid shot, a five-way spread, a laser that splits and bounces off of walls, a homing explosive shot, and Chaos which just does things and kills enemies sometimes.Apart from that, that's pretty much your lot for this game. It took me just over an hour and a half to beat the game on normal with a fair bit of exploration of the stages, but that's a pretty good length for a DOS-style game. It definitely has replay value, especially with higher difficulties and 100% playthroughs, so if you're into that kind of thing, this game will certainly be worth the $4. It's simple and compact, and there really isn't a thing Id change about it. 10/10.Story: Unlike a lot of DOS-shooters, this game actually has a pretty good story. It's a bit hard to follow, but it's a fairly high-level Sci-FI storyline about the creation of life. Surprisingly interesting and a not half bad delivery of what could be perceived as a dramatic ending. 8/10.Graphics: Fortunately, the game doesn't launch in CGA resolution; that would be annoying. Rather, it fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without a hassle, so that's all good. As for the art direction, it's quite good, even if the MURI suits look a bit like Robo-Bunnies. Apart from that, the world designs are good, the enemy designs can be absolutely fantastic, with the boss of Stage 3 being the big standout. I can't quite speak for whether or not it rigidly conforms to the EGA palette or not, but it looks DOS-y and it looks good. 5/5.Sound: This is something that I don't think I've done in the year or so since I started reviewing games (three months since I started publishing Steam reviews): I'm not gonna rate sound. I really can't, since the game itself goes for yet another factor of the DOS design in that there is no music - save for the title track - and all of the sounds are blips. So yeah, it feels a bit weird to do that, but that's what's happening.Overall scores are: 10/8/5/0; 9.2/10. A very solid little shooter that's well worth the money. I'll definitely play it again in the future."

Although a fairly short game, it offers a lot of replay value in the form of exploration and many difficulty settings. While experienced platformer fans will more or less breeze through it on Normal, try it on Hard or.. MURI difficulty! The difficulties also seem well balanced. All in all, it is probably a better game than Duke 1, with levels that are less maze-like and more logically laid-out. Though, that's not to say they are linear. Hell, for four bucks, grab it. If you liked those old Apogee games or stuff like Thexder, I think you will dig this one. I hope they produce a sequel some day."

Or at least you're hip and nerdy enough to honestly appreciate those kind of games?Well, here's your chance to relive that particular place in time and space with a new adventure! Play MURI for ten seconds and you'll be thrown back immediately (actually you don't even need those ten seconds - just look at the intro screen and listen to the theme music), and ever now and then you get surprised by some more modern contraptions.The controls are fine and work perfectly. Don't be put off by the lack of save game or map options, the levels aren't that big and the game isn't that long. You'll manage. The only thing I thing that should have been included is the option for the player to choose their own weapon type instead of automatic assignment. Not exactly sure why the devs choose to do otherwise, but oh well.The level design is fun and does the one thing right that so many games do wrong nowadays: you can fully backtrack every part of the level at your own pace and leisure to get all those hidden secrets and goodies.The enemies are the most interesting part of this short little hommage to the oldschool platforming era. They're quite original in design and behaviour and they fit the weird SciFi storyline perfectly imho. Can't say much more about it without spoiling it though, you'll need to experience that yourself.Get this game (especially when it's on sale, at the time of writing it's as low as €0.39)  and enjoy your one or two hours of well executed retro fun.
