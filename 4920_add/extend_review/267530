The levels are alot shorter than most of the other lego games so you move through it very fast but you can go back and free play and explore and get everything. Which is fun even after compeleting the level. There is a lego charm about this game that i dont think iv ever seen from any of the others, its fun just being in the game itfeels like your playing in a real lego world. I would recommend thisd to anyone who like video games. Id give 9/10"

Most of the characters are useless, a lot of bugs inside the game (some can make your savefile unable to complete the game 100%), boring sidequests and very short in length compared to other LEGO games.By no means is this game bad, but it isn't among the best either."

Both have spent tons of time on this game and it seems like it never gets old to them. Very good buy. I should also add that this game runs very well on low end systems. Have yet to get a complaint from them on any bugs or annoyances.
,Recommended,267530,16430173,"Posted: 15 June, 2015",all,Serieus,"Traveler's Tales again offers a fun game for all ages.  This game offers 15 levels that span the movie's storyline.  The levels are filled with collectables that give you construction manuals so you can move the level forward or give you other collectibles that help you get extra abilities or special construction manuals that you can only use in the final hub of the game.Overall, this game plays like most other movie related games like Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  However, not everyone like the Lego Movie, so this may not be as attractive for some as it would be for others.  My kids loved this more than me, yet I enjoyed the Star Wars and Indiana Jones games more.  However, the game and graphics are just as good, just as fun, and just as long.I did find a few glitches here in this game that I had not found in other games.  Though, reloading a level or a hub easily fixed my issue.Definitely a fun game that I'd recommend to you, especially if you have kids that play with you."

,Recommended,267530,12872164,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,Kailen,"Well, even a mediocre Lego game is still above average overall. This one's short. It's got some bugs, but most Lego games do.  Honestly? This game is OK. It follows the movie fairly well, but there are points of divergence. And more than just ""makes for a better video game"". There are parts that honestly felt like it was an earlier draft of the movie. Which wouldn't surprise me. The game was released the same day the movie hit theaters. That strikes me as a bad idea. You haven't given the movie time to build interest in the game, and the parallel development means that if a change is made for the movie, the game lags behind. This was most noticeable with the cut scenes. They were taken from the movie, but the music is wrong - when it exists at all. Music is added fairly late in the film, and it's entirely possible that the scenes were sent to the game before the music was complete. The music that does exist smacks of ""temp tracks"". It's just not good, doesn't fit. One scene in particular, taken from the movie, references a specific song.. that's not in the game. Which makes that cut-scene particularly awkward.It has an interesting mechanic in the swapping of pants. You can unlock pants that give you an effect in game. There's only a couple effects that actually make any real difference. And it's more ""good idea, bad execution"" than anything else. The fact that some of the pants are only available via codes found with the Lego sets for the movie troubles me. Not that the codes are hard to find. I'm sure they were online the day the sets were released, if not sooner. I don't really mind it for something like the alternate character model that the DVD/Blu-Ray comes with a code for, since that's purely cosmetic (though it does give access to a character and thus its abilities sooner). The pants, on the other hand, do have an effect on the game. Again, only one has any major impact, and there's a similar - but not exact - pair in the game you can unlock. Maybe I'm just being a curmudgeon here, I have nothing really against cross promotion in general. As long as it's cosmetic.Overall? Well, the game was on sale, so it's not like I paid anywhere near full price for it. And I certainly got my 'money's worth' out of it. But, on sale is really the only time I would recommend this particular game. Especially given the quality of others in the series, such as Lego Star Wars III and Lego Marvel Superheroes.  Still, if you are looking for more Lego games to feed your addiction, this one can fill the gap nicely."

That aside, it's a good game, there is some new things that gives a bit of variety inside this whole franchise (Like the dancing or the building with guide) and I did enjoy it a lot.

It never dipped below 60 even in prolong use. What really surprised me about this game is that is features all the original voice actors of the movie like: Will Ferrell, Chris Pratt, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Charlie Day, Elizabeth Banks, etc. They are all here with new lines just for the video game. That really impressed me. The gameplay does get repetitive at times but it's all fun. My only complaint is that their is not much to do after you beat the game unless you want to go for achievements. Also the game plays a bit wonky with keyboard/mouse. I highly recommend playing this game with a gamepad instead. It's a 7.5/10 for me."

Also visually the choice to use actual movie footage as opposed to recreating the movie scenes with real-time animations as they have done in EVERY other lego games led to a disparity between the cut scenes and the real time play which I found quite jarring - it generally made the game look even worse every time you jumped back in..Anyway that's my rant. If you're buying this for a kid they probably won't notice or care about the things that annoy me, but think twice if you're buying it expecting a top notch lego game."

I love the added features like the Building Instructions and the Pacman-style hacking mini-game which are both really fun and break up the casual gameplay which can get boring after a while. I also really like the level design which means the game is not too difficult but easy enough that I can keep on playing and is the only Lego game I\'ve played so far that I literally couldn\'t put down. I\'m also not a big fan of the massively open-world Lego games as I can easily get lost and I won\'t know where to go but this game shows where to go easily.The only criticism I would give is that the setting menu is lacking, especially for PC users but this is present throughout all of the Lego games. The default keys are also lacking but I also have my own setup which works for me as well as a controller which I sometimes use. I also couldn\'t find the resolution settings in game which I think should be more obvious as I ended up playing in the wrong one for half of the game. I also came across a few bugs but they weren\'t game breaking and didn\'t require me to restart the level (like Uni-kitty getting stuck in places, but this was easily fixed by just jumping out, even thought it took a while).Overall I do recommend this game to people who like Lego games as it does offer a slightly different formula to the original games we all know and love and I would love to see this same formula reused again (perhaps using the same characters but with a new story?)"

,Recommended,267530,10387077,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,VirtuaroidPilot,"BitzComms Reviews: The Lego Movie Video Game(This review covers the PC - Your experience may differ from platform to platform)I have to be honest with you - The Lego Movie came to me by complete surprise. For all the time I spend on YouTube, no word was spoken of the movie (at least that I saw) until I first saw the trailer for it on TV...But then I was surprised even more when a video game was announced for it - It wasn't even a full year after Lego Marvel Super Heroes came out, and Traveller's Tales came out with a new game already?It was more surprising that the game was coming to all major platforms, INCLUDING next gen platforms like the PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, in addition to the PC, Xbox 360 and PS3... Yikes.The short development period between this and Marvel seemed like a sign that this game was going to blow HARD... But then I played it, and it is probably my favorite Traveller's Tales Lego game of all time.STORY:The game follows the story of the movie down pat... Which might turn off those who haven't seen it yet. I suggest you see the movie before you play the game, but even if you don't, the game doesn't feature EVERY scene from the movie... Some of the scenes that are in the game have parts that were cut from the movie, most likely to keep from spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it. I won't explain the story itself, because we have a movie for that, and I wouldn't want to spoil anything.PRESENTATION:The Lego games that have been developed by Traveller's Tales over the years have had a reputation of exceptional presentation, and this one is no different. The game is fully voiced, and either they got the celebrity voices from the movie to do the game, or they just got really, really good sound-alikes. If it's the latter, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference because the acting in this game is so damn good. As I said before, the story is presented through scenes from the movie, and while that may sound kind of cheap, you have to keep in mind the short period between the release of this and Marvel. Plus, the scenes look so good already that you won't mind at all. It kind of harkens back to the days of movie tie-ins on the Playstation, which generally used scenes from the movie for the cutscenes of the game. Anyone remember Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue? (also developed by Traveller's Tales) The game also makes use of a new animation style - The characters actually move like actual lego... No more bendy, stretchy lego limbs. This is probably done to stay true to the stop-motion style of the movie.GRAPHICS:The game looks amazing, as everything is made of Lego this time around. The game also runs really well on low-end machines like mine, and that's always a plus.SOUND:Everything is Awesome!GAMEPLAY:Here's where things get pretty iffy - The game itself is a mixed bag. While this is my favorite TT Lego title so far, I can't deny this game has some serious problems. Let's first talk about the character selection - There are over NINETY characters... NINETY CHARACTERS. Don't get too excited though, as most of the characters are either clones of existing characters, or very minor characters that no one cares about. Most of the characters are different suits for Emmet. Wild Style or Unikitty. There are some good ones in this game, such as Lord Business, Metalbeard, Batman, Super Man, The Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and even the Green Ninja from Lego Ninjago.Emmet himself is a pretty boring character as well. For the majority of the game, all he can really do is use instruction builds. He can't use master builds, and he doesn't have any interesting attacks or gimmicks. Most of the time, you'll be playing as Wild Style, Batman and Unikitty, switching to Emmet only when you need to use an instruction build. Eventually Emmet gets the ability to use Master Builds, but that's very late in the game.Next, let's talk about the gameplay. The game follows the same basic formula as any other TT Lego title before it - Go through the levels, collecting studs and accomplishing objectives with preset characters, then go back and play those levels as any character to find hidden unlockables - Only this time it's mixed with free-roaming hub worlds, and my GOD these are underwhelming. Compared to Lego City: Undercover and especially Lego Marvel Super Heroes, these free-roaming segments seem to be just an after-thought. They are very small and contained. Not very much fun.Next, let's talk about the levels for a minute. The levels are probably the best part of the game, with only a few stinkers here and there. The only problem is that many of them are very long, and when there's a bad level, there's a REALLY bad level. Each level is quite interesting, with its own gimmick and setpieces. There's an entire level that takes place on an under-constuction submarine that's careening down an ablaze Cloud Cuckoo Land. Many of the level designs are very inspired and smart, but they are quite long, and if you don't have a lot of time for one session, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. There are checkpoints placed around the levels that allow you to save your progress, but some of them are placed in areas where you really wouldn't notice them... oops.THE VERDICT:As a whole, however, The Lego Movie Video Game is quite solid, considering the short development period. There's a lot of content in here, and most of the levels are fun, if not a bit too long. I'm giving this game a 7.0 out of 10."

This is as close as you can come to it.It's different from the other lego games, mainly because the entire world is lego and because it isn't based off an entire trilogy. The story is short and kind of pointless..you have seen the movie right? There isn't much to work with and the movie is already in lego, so there goes that angle. They have done a terrific job with what they had.The game is mostly smashing stuff and finding stuff, with a couple of awesome mini-games thrown in. You have to complete small tasks and usually build something. It doesn't play like all of the other lego games. This one is fun and different. All of the NPCs are funny - I laughed anyway :)I'm thinking that kids might not ""get"" this game...there's a lot of dad jokes and sly humour. This is easily my favourite lego game. Star Wars rates second.The graphics are massively improved from previous efforts. Don't be fooled by the default setting(which is an eyesore) - you have to actually start a game before you can change the graphics settings. Yeah, it's a terrible idea, get over it.Everything in the game is lego. There is a lot of detail. Very pretty.Awesome game."

One more thing about the game is when your in a level its not like the other lego games and all you hear is the music.

I played every single one to 100% up until LoTR and have played a smattering to 100% since then.Lego games are a blast. They're super formulaic. Destroy, build, run around collecting stuff and find hidden things. I love the cutesy sense of humor that these games bring to the table. Before the days when the Lego games included voice acting, there was such a great charm in the way the characters moved around to convey the mood. Despite voice acting, that is still there. This game is no different. They took a great movie and turned it into a full length lego game.The HUB world is huge, but this game followed the LoTR and Harry Potter style of adding ghost coins to follow in order to know where to go. The vehicles handle beautifully. The character purchasing is done from a menu in this game instead of running around on a wild goose chase.Now the bad: This IS a Lego-ey Lego game. Which means it will feel that no one ever beta tested it. When I played Lego Potter (1-4), I had a game breaking glitch. I restarted the game. I had a completely different game breaking glitch. Same That's the only Lego game I have ever played and not played to 100%. The bad news: While playing this, I have hit almost a dozen glitches and I have not even finished story mode yet. Cut scenes won't load, areas don't register so I can't enter them, it will show I have to kill enemies but none will spawn. Worst of all, when I save and exit the level, it doesn't remember my progress. The good news is these aren't game breaking problems (yet). Each time I find these issues, I quit out and the bug is gone the next time I play.I recommend this game as a Lego game. It does exactly what you would expect from this style of game. It's light hearted, fun, charming and addictive. It is also incredibly glitchy, like most Lego games. Play this at your own risk!"

Second, the gameplay, I haven't gotten stuck once or found ONE glitch in the game yet for playing for over 2-3 hours! The combat system is very fun ripping through blocky lego people, and the building aspect is not alot like the other ones while they introduce the part finding system which makes it easy for kids.

Here are some thoughts.StoryI like Lego Movie and game sticks to movie plot. But you know all of the cutscenes are cut from the film and it looks really cheap.GraphicsI rarely talk about graphics but here I'll say something. Here's the thing it looks so bright and kinda blurred. Everybody looks like gummy bears. In some levels gamma and filters are so bad that i can't get into atmosphere. Lego Lotr had even better graphics and design and this is older game.Map/WorldThere are 4 locations and they are pretty small. 6 missons are located in first zone. These worlds are connected by a teleport so there is no traveling experience. Also there is nothing interesting in locations they've removed huge quests from npc. Usually objective is close to npc. You dont need to find characters anymore you can unlock them in selection menu. So there is no point to investigate world anymore just for the red bricks.CharactersThere are a lot of them. The problem is you dont need them all. In other Lego games you encountered around 90 % of all characters during the game which made some interest in finding and playing those guys. Here you will face less than a 50% of all characters. Most of them are same and some are really powerfull  what makes the majority of figures useless.GameplaySame old Lego platformer. Exept fighting and mission content is really poor. Its just boring. Its hard to explain why. Maybe cuz you are playing same characters till the end. And I dont like this feature with building stuff its kinda boring also.CollectablesPants, gold manuals and gold bricks i dont know what they do really. Pants give you powerups like more speed and ... i really equiped only 1 pants so they are like forging items from Lego Lotr. And golden manuals allow you to build some vehicles in bonus room. Again i find it bad idea. Ive completed bonus room with the Superman and he has more functions that those vehicles. Its a good move to finally use minikits for something but not for the bonus level where they are also unnecessary.MusicYou know it doesnt give you a proper drive and some compositions are really annoying. Especially ones which are repeated. It seems voice acting was done in a hurry, it sounds really cheap and unemotional.ConclusionLike I prevoisly said it seems that this game was made in a great hurry. I didnt really like it ive completed it only because of achievements. Id like to mention some bugs. Sometimes scripts dont work and some folks cant get red bricks because some stuff is just floating in the air that spoils game. 4/10"

There was something simple and charming about those games that will always appeal to me more than the quagmire that a few of the later games sunk into, in my opinion. I felt later games disappeared into a hole of fiddly complexity regarding character abilities and level design that sucked the fun out of playing.In saying that, The Lego Movie: The Game rises above a lot of the others I've played, giving you multiple open-world hubs to play around in, as well as some entertaining levels that expand competently upon the movie's premise and retain the sense of fun and variety that Lego embodies as a product.The voice acting is very good considering that the actors are mimicking the original stars, and it's rare that you feel like you're not ACTUALLY listening to the movie's actors.My only sizable criticism comes from that point when you realise that there isn't actually much gameplay in these games, and it mostly relies on your compulsive desire to keep collecting studs to keep you entertained. At that point I found myself wondering whether I was either playing a cheap cash-in, or whether I was playing a decent Lego game and it was just that the series is designed in such a way that, by exploited our completionist desires, they can squeeze the most amount of fun out of the least amount of effort. If it's the former, it's hard to tell, and if it's the latter, I feel like I have to applaud the developers for their ingenuity.Either way, I had fun while I was doing it, alhough I probably won't feel any reason to come back to this particular game after I've finished, as opposed to the Original Trilogy games, as my attachment to the Lego Movie was not great enough to make that a specific draw for me.One last criticism is that I found the music to be annoying as ♥♥♥♥. I'm not a fan of the ethereal electronic soundtrack, and in the film the Everything is Awesome song is supposed to be a satirical take on bland, emotionless, corporate-built pop that is intended to be an ear-worm in the most annoying possible way. So when the developers decided to slap it all over the place in this game and have it haunt the dreams of everyone who plays it, they either missed the point of the film entirely in that regard, or they're ♥♥♥♥ing with us.7/10"

The game follows the movie, duh, and unfortunately while the movie is brought forth in this really cool 90 minute flick, the game is a bit more like a boring chore. For a number of reasons. Firstly, if you saw the movie - this game is ALMOST the same thing. Even if you were a huge fan of the film, this might not exactly be worth your while; here is why I personally didn't enjoy this game as much as I should have.The scenes in the film which took like 2 minutes take like 30 minutes here, they just made the levels really drawn out and boring. I loved some missions, but overall it is a very mixed bag.It is pretty boring. While it is common knowledge that LEGO games are for kids, developer TT has shown us that they are capable of making an experience good for all ages. But this game has incredibly obvious puzzles, combat that sometimes doesn't even require you to do anything other than mash a button, and rather unpleasant graphics. I mean, it looks decent, but I think I've seen better. The game is about 7 to 8 hours long. Some missions are actually decent fun, and the cast and movie scenes are good and all, but it just isn't fun enough and won't last you long. I would say don't get it OR watch a great amount of gameplay on YouTube before making the purchase. Even at a really heavy discount I can't recommend this game, and especially over the movie. Get some of the other LEGO games if you feel like experiencing those. My personal recommendation would be any LEGO Star Wars game."

The movie humour is present and very enjoyable but does not become tedious. There has been a lot of improvement in gameplay mechanics: the camera was great, the level length was just right, the free play areas were enjoyable and there were no frustrating 'jump just right' challenges. The graphics are a whole level above the graphics of other games because of the way they incorporated Lego scenery, and it's fantastic. The building minigame was too fast for me but was infrequent (unlike Lego Hobbit) and there were fewer collectibles of all sorts. Each level had 5 gold instruction manuals and one pair of pants (Honey, where are my pants?!). Gold bricks are not collected but represent your overall completion (there were 70, while Lego Marvel had 250). The variety of collectible characters is spot-on, there are relatively few, but they are all fun to play and can be unlocked easily (once you complete the appropriate level). The music within levels and in free play areas was never odious. Doing each level was fun - Lego games are often criticised for having no challenge to them, i.e., break stuff until you complete the level - but this game has the most variety (and least repetition) yet.In short, this is a really fun game to play. There is a lot of variety and humour; the game is colourful, the graphics are great and the levels are balanced. It's a lot shorter than other Lego games, and I have thus been able to completely finish it while still enjoying it.I'd say it's 'as good' as Lego Marvel, but there is a lot less of it.

This was one of the best things about Lego Batman 2 and particularly Lego Marvel Heroes- going from a walking character and seeing all the tantalizing skyscrapers to finally being able to fly to the top and all around them.Hitting all the invisible walls as Superman in Lego Movie was disappointing, to say the least.So in the end, a good game, but it still doesn't top Lego Marvel Heroes."

I feel, however, that this videogame is possibly the weakest entry in the series.It seems that it has been delegated to a ""B"" team - TT Fusion and it shows. Gone are delightful interactions, varied builds and awesome cutscenes. Instead - you get parts of the movie (with Star Wars characters blurred out) and repetitive gameplay.In most LEGO games you are required to mix a variety of ""skills"" and solve puzzles. In here, the element has been vastly simplified in favor of multiple ""setpieces"" where master builders build amazing huge things from 3 random elements on the screen. It is boring and happens over and over.Similarly, many characters always build the same thing (unikity builds the same ugly springboard 90% of the time she jumps into action).The game is also rather difficult to complete on free play mode as the way level triggers are set up tends to break if you have a character that allows you to bypass several story steps.If you are crazy for LEGO games and played all the others - give it a shot, but if you have other options - play those first. Personally I'd recommend LEGO Batman 3."

There's lots of similarities to some of the newest LEGO games as well as the older ones, such as high-jumping female characters, character selection wheels, and of course, buildable portions of levelsHowever, there are some major issues I have with the LEGO Movies' video-game partner:Firstly, the graphics. It seriously seems like LEGO thinks that the graphics for LEGO Worlds is the greatest thing in the whole world. In reality, it makes it look plain awful for a company well-known for making their games look and feel like you're actually in the world that the game is set in. It looks like the older LSW (LEGO Star Wars) games. It looks incredibly childish and doesn't do the LEGO video-game franchise anything.Second, a pre-determined story that is incredibly predictable when you've seen the movie itself. I get that LEGO wanted to incorporate the movie into the game, but a different storyline would have given it more ""oomph"", as they say.Third, I found the levels to be rather long. There's a certain length that the first LEGO Batman: The Video-game had for it's levels, and the last chapter in each of the three campaigns was always the longest and most action-packed parts, Plus about every level had a boss fight, with the exception of a few where the would-be boss had already been captured and taken back to Arkham Asylum during the villains' side of the story.I'm not saying that it's all-around bad,'but there's a lot to be desired with it. I highly encourage you to play this game yourself and decide whether it's worth it or not."

Personally, I preferred when Lego didnt have people talking and just had squeaks and grunts for ""voice acting"", but besides personal predjudice, it sounds like the actors aren't even trying. They sound like really badly done robots, until the part where they're supposed to be robots, and then they sound like even worse robots. It feels like the actors put all their energy into making the movie and did the game while they were half-asleep. Not only that, not keeping all the same voice actors from the movie has really damaged it, especially since they actually PUT IN SCENES FROM THE MOVIE. They voiced over the scenes again? Really?On top of that, the game was obviously designed for console first, with very little effort put into porting it to the computer. Evidence? On many occasions there are minigames. These minigames are insanely difficult with the mouse of keyboard, because you have to be very fast and make as few mistakes as possible, whereas if you had a controller you can use the 8 directional movement of a stick with ease. There's also a dancing minigame that doesnt even use keyboard keys; it says ABXY for directions, and if you don't own a controller for your computer and you don't know the key layout of a console controller by heart, it's incredibly difficult.With most lego games, when they add areas and things, it's really fun, seeing possible parts of the storyline the movies don't go into; with this, it feels cheap and dull, mostly. It's not necessarily a bad game, but falls far, far short of my expectations and hopes, and far from the movie and other Lego games."

It lacks the charm of both the movie and the other games.  The building with instructions has some rather finnicky controls.  It's just not worth spending your money on this.
,Not Recommended,267530,11104796,"Posted: 6 July, 2014",all,CJ,"In short:I do not recommend this game. Not even if you liked the actual movie. This feels like an utter and complete cash cow. I completed the story in less than 6 hours (no cutscenes were skipped), but didn't play it to 100%.In long:The game itself is as bad as usual - barely any practical options (not even fullscreen), a LOT of bugs, and like with the LEGO games from other franchises, if you don't know the franchise itself - in this case the story of the actual movie - you will most likely have trouble following all the way through. Oh, and it still changes the Windows 7 color scheme to the basic color scheme, for whatever reason. Seems familiar? This shouldn't even be an issue!The cutscenes were taken from the movie. While they were nice in the movie theater, it's rubbish in this game. Come on, you guys had the models from the game and even the sounds, would it have been too much to ask to animate it with proper 3D models and ""full"" framerate (as full as it gets in the recent LEGO games) instead of using the stop motion movie scenes? It doesn't fit in with the rest of the game! Aside from that, Milhouse was blurred out in one of the cutscenes. There is so much wrong with that!The gameplay is as repetitive and enjoyable as always. Contentwise this is barely a competition to other LEGO games. They don't even have the full skill wheel filled with skills!If this goes down to 10€/10$/something like that, get it, otherwise this probably won't satisfy you. Do not expect anything good, it's the old LEGO game formula reskinned, and nothing else. The minigames have been swapped for a pacman-like one, and a stupid reaction game, disguised as ""building by instruction"". You just pick the necessary part out of a list of 8 parts. much fun. wow.That being said: if I were a LEGO figure, I'd go for Lucy. So hot. <3"

Why? cause the cut scens are taken directly from the film.  Now that's true for all the other movie based Lego movie games, but this mone more so mainly you are dasically playing the movie. The core game play is the same run around building or destroying objects. for some people that gets a little boring. But for fans of Lego the fun just never stops. All the voice actors from the movie reprise their rolls. Just like in the movie you get the pop culture references and charatures from other lego games like Batman Superman and Wonder Woman. Just like in every Lego game there is a lot of backtracking through the stages with different characters just to fully complete it. That means there is a lot of replay value.MY VERDICT:iIf you're not a fan of Lego or the games  or the repeatitive game play or backtracking then this isnt ment for you. for the rest of you  i cannot recommend it enough.

They tried changing the game mechanics for the better, which is fine once in a while, but it just doesn't feel like a lego game. I'm switching to another character every 10 seconds so I can progress in the level. The worst part is the machines only robots can use. It's this small minigame where you hop around as a block on this puzzle and get to a battery while dodging the skull blocks, and they make you do this minigame way too much in the game. Some mechanics are good, like bigger hubs with cars and the ability to have like 8 people to pick from at once, also I like the bonus room. But overall, a lego game should not feel the way this game did. I've played so many lego games when I was younger, but this game was just irritating. The humor isn't witty like the old games. In the old games there were bonus rooms you looked forward to going to because there were special activies you could do, but in this game it almost feels like a drag to go to them because you have to constantly switch to different characters for their abilities...Overall Rating 7/10"

For example, in Free Play after one of the game's end missions you have to escape a construction site but half the objects don't generate for several minutes making it barely playable. Your AI friendos don't even make an attempt to attack the enemy and instead just stand around and die. Meanwhile the enemy AI either swarms you and does nothing or swarms your team AI and dies.In terms of optimization this thing was terrible too. It took a while before this thing was even playable - It was locked at 1280x768 for crying out loud and you couldn't change it. And that isn't the only issue with the game's graphics, you have to make some major tweaks to make sure this game doesn't look blurry and fuzzy. Oh, and you can't access video options without actually starting the game.Character balancing is all over the place. Unikitty would be the only worthwhile character to play as if it weren't for the fact that the feline can't activate switches or climb certain ""girl sections"" such as jump walls and climbing walls. Metalbeard is extremely overpowered too. You really don't need to use anyone else after you find him because he kills everything, but if you want to move faster then your other option is Bad Cop who is nearly game-breaking. His laser straight-up instakills everything it touches making him extremely deadly. The gameplay is weird too, every now and then you get these puzzle sections which are just broken or badly thought out. For example, the enemy AI on the hacking game is TERRIBLE. They never accurately predict where to move and end up moving from one end of the map to the other. There is a ""brick matching"" minigame which requires ninja-esque reaction time to complete without losing studs and even then you will probably still lose some due to how unresponsive the game is. Lastly, there's the useless dancing sections. They are BROKEN. Broken, broken, broken. The opening one set in a construction site is barely responsive and the second, and last one is completely broken - You can't do anything but lose the game. They still haven't fixed that after quite a long time either.Lastly, this is a HUGE spoiler for The Lego Movie. It literally uses entire major scenes from The Lego Movie instead of real cutscenes and they're presented in a crappy aspect ratio which makes them barely watchable and therefore useless.Play it with your kids, they'll like it. It's long enough for them to be able to enjoy it but it's easy, has bad balancing, terrible optimization and bad puzzle design to match."

I've gotten many adults and kids to watch it with me and it never gets old. The Lego Movie is my favorite movie and the game was well... let me explain why I dislike the game. First some elements of the story just weren't there and others were just completely extended to where you're wondering 'this isn't the movie' and also other things were added to extend the game(like the stupid sub level). The game itself is a standard Lego game and that makes it perfectly fine. It's as good as say Lego Batman The Video Game. So for that reason you should get it. But things like not being able to use your mouse or funky menu layout is kind of frustrating. You can't access the graphics settings unless you go into a level. Also like most other movie tie-ins The Lego Movie Game used lots of scenes from the Lego Movie itself (but both were made out of bricks so I think that's why they did it). The main reason I don't recommend it is that, The Lego Movie was great and I'm not saying the game isn't, I'm saying it's not as good. And really The Lego Movie Video Game is just a Lego Game.^|(Honestly this doesn't matter because this is just personal opinion, also if you haven't watch the movie before you play the game. If you don't the game will ruin the movie.)"

At first I was skeptical of actually getting out of my house and doing something other than play video games, but this girl really reached out for me. We went to our local movie theatre and watched The Notebook. We cuddled the whole time and shared all the happy and sad tears together. She was the most beautiful thing in the world. After that we went everywhere together from our houses to restaurants and the library. Everything in life was great. Every thought I had of suicide before I met this girl, seemed utterly stupid and rash. Every movie we watched together was just 10 times better than watching it alone. Everything was awesome. I said to myself. ""Everything is cool when you're part of a team."" Until one day I started to notice something. My items of value started to disappear. The first thing I noticed was my special fleshlight that I always kept in my secret shoebox and used whenever a girl would say hi to me at school. Of course I used it after and not during school because that would just be weird. Then my collection of Hentai magazines were gone and I thought I had misplaced them until I saw my girlfriend run across my yard with something suspicious rustling in her bag. I put on my 1000$ antique ninja suit and pursued her throughout out city. Using my superb cardio skills and gainz from the gym, I beat her to her house. I waited patiently in her bushes like I used to when I watched her change before school. As she arrived to her doorstep I leaped out of the bushes and clung onto her like an angry primeape and took off her bag and looked inside. Not only were my sexy kawaii anime figures and magazines in there, but something even more unforgivable. My 8th grade lego set my mother gave to me on my 13th birthday. She tried to explain, but my eyes were blurred with blood, rage, and tears; and a little bit of horniness. I unsheathed my 400$ mock Zanpakutō and stabbed her in the heart. After 5 minutes I had realized what I had done and collapsed to the ground. I awoke to the sound of an ER machine beeping. I was in a hospital with the doctor leaned over me with his rock hard♥♥♥♥♥♥ He spoke to mean and said, ""Sam i'm sorry to have to tell you this but you have been in a coma for 40 years. It's not all bad you still have Half of your Life left. It is when I heard that that I knew I had to play Lego® Movie the Videogame the videogame drama classic the videogame game movie game. video"

This time the game is based on the ""Lego Movie"". It has the story line filled with humor that we know from the lego games. A lott of charakters from the ""Lego Movie' buatifull decorations, funny quests and tasks. But there ist still something wrong with this game.I very like to play the ""lego"" video games, it all started with ""lego star wars"" from 2005, since that passed a lot of time and a lot hase changed to the positiv side. The game have ""evolved"". But in this game they decided to remove a lot of things that made the lego game much comfotable, -and thats pretty sadly. This is a list of things that could be better.- There is no map for the openworld. So discovering everything in the world is very anoying, the locations are pretty large and you will need the help of internet to orient on it some times.-The background music, they used ""everything is awesome"" made different style covers from it. And thats all. so in the open world and in the most time of the missions you will just lissten to the same song... and if you want to play the whole game trhow and discover everyting it ist realy anoying after 10 hours of gameplay,-The game isnt so difficult as the games before, usualy you needed about 25-35 hours to discvoer everythin (lego lord of the rings, lego marvel super heroes) in this cause you will need no more tham 13-15 hours.I think its about 1-1,5 years since i played the game.

Maybe if you are younger than 12 and you liked the film, but for anyone older, definetly not the game to get. In this verison of  the LEGO movie, you aren't getting the good voices from the  film, but slightly similar voices. It does ad new building features, which are typically not included, yet they are better than most. Anyway, I have to say in the end it is pretty boring and felt more like a chore than a game.

76561198060219701,Recommended,267530,18230354,"Posted: 27 September, 2015",all,lostcraft,"The LEGO games follow a strict formula: Take a franchise/movie, recreate it in the most amazingly silly way possible, and make the audience replay memorable scenes in beautifully designed set-pieces. Star Wars, Middle Earth, Batman, you name it- in each LEGO game you get what could best be described as an affectionate parody, with MiniFigs and an awful lot of brick.-smashing. And The LEGO Movie Videogame is just the same, with all the good and the bad this brings.The LMV follows the basic plot of the movie: Normal everyday construction worker Emmet is pulled into an ancient prophecy that claims him to be the only one to save the world from a doomsday weapon called ""The Kragle"". Despite being utterly unqualified for the job he does his best, and hilarity ensues.If you know the movie (and you should) you'll find it hard not to smile a few minutes into the game. The complete cast is there, the setpieces are amazing and occasionally outshine the movie, the voice acting is pitch perfect and the undiluted charme of giant scenery build out of LEGO is as ever-present as ever. The game looks amazing and pulls a lot of awesome scenes together to form a narrative that is pretty close to the movie.As per usual, you control a growing cast of characters, each with their own ability set. Emmet can build sturdy objects with the proper instructions, and can smash through special bricks with his drill. Wyldstyle has some extra agility and can jump and climb on certain ledges, Batman gets his ever-useful Batarangs and grappling ropes, and so on. Using and combining these abilities make the bulk of the level's challenge, and the game does a good job of adding layers to the formula as the cast expands.Controls, also as usual, are nice and tight enough. The keyboard is a bit inferior to a good gamepad, but both work in a pinch. Switching characters and pulling off their moves is easily learned, and the game goes the extra mile to pop up tooltips if you keep missing a hint. Despite the cheerful toy aesthetic children will probably be overwhelmed by the action. There is always somethign going on, there is always something to do, and while death is cheap (you only lose a couple of studs, which are the in-game currency for everything) there is a certain difficulty here, a tad bit too easy for older, experienced players and a tad bit too hard for someone who's just learning the ropes.With a ton of unlockable characters, mission and freeplay game modes, and downright over-the-top-awesomeness, the LMV should be easy to recommend: It is an awesome game and filled to the brim with charme and action.Still, I need to stress that this game makes not exactly much sense if you do not know the movie. And even IF you know the movie, you'll have a hard time following events, so much that the levels stop being a string of related missions and instead become little self-contained bits connected with (occasionally edited) movie footage.And this is odd, because the game clearly knows what it is doing. The movie has a bike chase, which is awesome. The game stretches this chase over a whole level, and adds to it, and makes it just twice as awesome because this time, it's you playing that scene. I would have loved to see the team make their own plot, with in-game rendered cutscenes, and maybe explore the LEGO world a bit more.Still, this is nitpicking. The fun is there, and chasing down all achievements and unlockables will take a while- and this is a game where you abseil into a LEGO chicken, get encased in a rainbow eggshell, have a unicorn-cat smash that eggshell and build a toy-mouse car out of the bricks, which you can then ride, as Batman, all the while grumbling how rainbows are soo corny.Need I say more?"

Even characters who never showed up in the film have great lines.

My daughter plays this as her go-to game, and not inherrently because she likes LEGO more than anything else, but mainly because it's just fun. And it is, it's exactly that. It's easy to control, it provides cut-sceens from the movie that give you setups for the game level so you know what's going on, and other than the scripted scenes, it allows you to go and do whatever you want.You can chose who you want to play as for the open-world scenes, and for the missions you have a roster of characters that can peform certain abilities nessesary to progress the story. There is also a section where you can construct your own character and add them to your character set to use in-game.I would say that the game is designed with a certain balance that is very clever. My daughter (4) could do certain parts of the game easily and without prompt, however other areas she saw herself as completely stuck and required my help. Now as annoying as that might seem to some, it provided a nice family-game-night experience for us both. I would reccomend the game on that alone.Studs, you cannot collect them all. Fact."

It seems a lot more childish than the past games, I know a lot of 'lego' is aimed at younger children but the other games and a lot of lego products themselves are usualyl bought by older audiences.The fact that the cutscenes are from the movie kind of annoys me, I feel like the game was made very quickly without much testing or overlooking at all, I'm on level 2 and I have found a lot of bugs already. I've also found that the controls for this game are extremely annoying, mainly because I am used to being able to change them to be able to use the left click for the action button, sadly I am unable to do that in this game.Although most of this review has been 'bad', I would suggest buying this game for a younger audience other than an older audience like most of the other games. If they were to fix some bugs and allow me to change the 'action' button to left mouse click that would also make me very happy.I plan to play through the entire game, so this review may change in the future, but for now, this is my thoughts on the game."

,Recommended,267530,11477869,"Posted: 30 July, 2014",all,PinkPony,"The Lego Movie Game is, sadly, one of the worst Lego games to have come out for a while, on par with some of the first to be released. This game is first and foremost a movie tie-in, make no mistake. There is no original story, movie clips are used instead of in-game cutscenes, and don't expect any inivation beyond two bland mini-games.I've loved all the Lego games so far, and I got this one with the express purpose to play as Unikitty, and on that it delivered. What it didn't deliver is that scope that we've come to expect from modern Lego games, such as sprawling open worlds, a large cast of characters, and a host of special skills that are drip-fed to you throughout. Let's look at these in more detail:The character select screen may seem healthy, boasting 90-odd characters, but take a moment to consider who these characters are. Most are generic citizens who got mere seconds of screen time, or the mini-figured you find in the blind bags: Panda Man, Taco Tuesday Guy, and Larry the Barista are among the memorable characters you can play as, who only differ in apperance and the object they throw. The main character Emmet has not one, not three, but thirteen variations, all seperate (unlike most Lego games that stack variations of the same character on one spot) and all exactly the same, with two exceptions. Also, only the main characters have facial animations, and not even they get lip-synching when they talk.The world is divided into four areas and a bonus zone; Bricksburg, The Old West, Cloud Coocooland and the Octan Tower. These areas consist of more or less two rooms, with missions scattered around, with no central 'hub' to begin them. Characters are bought from the character select screen, as with the newer games, but the mini-figures can also be found scattered around to buy in-person, which is completely redundant. Within 10-hours of gameplay, taking my time, I have already finished the game, bought all the characters, and bought all the red blocks, making this the shortest Lego game I've ever played (and I've played most).The unique skills in this game are nothing mind-blowing: silver needs explosives, gold needs a laser, only construction-workers can repair, only women can be acrobatic (that's right, Batman cannot climb walls or jump around), only Master Builders can make objects, only Unikitty can use rainbow blocks, etc. etc. All very standard and mostly things we've seen before, too. Aside from Lord Buisness, who you get at the end of the game, most bonus obstacles can be cleared by the half-way point, let's say 6-hours in. It's a Lego game, so obviously you'll be going back and playing it all a second time in Free Play mode to unlock everything, but this certainly won't take anywhere near as long as the comparative colossus, Lego Batman 2.~In summation: This is a game for people who loved the movie. You'll get to see it all again and play with characters you probably won't otherwise get to, such as Unikitty. The gameplay is exactly as you'd expect, nothing breaks the formula, and anything new is few and far between. And you'd best hope you like the soundtrack, because you'll be hearing three particular songs an awful lot. In short: It's silly, short fun, but don't expect much more for you money beyond a playable advertisment. I recommend it because it is exactly what it is: It's not great, but it's not bad either, but it most certainly IS a movie tie-in game, and should be treated as such."

This one is by far is my favorite though.  If you're a fan of the movie you can appreciate the intertwining of the LEGO game world and the movie (cut scene) inclusion.The game play is as great as any other Lego game but the incorporation of the movie immerses you into the story which you fell in love with.If there's one Lego game that is a must buy this is the one.  It'll give you hours of great fun whether it's being played with or without the kids :).

I have heard a lot of negative reviews for some of the LEGO games and this one really knocked it out of the park, in my opinion. The levels are fun and the collectables make it worth replaying. If you are a fan of the movie this game is for you for sure. It is funny at times with some gags, for older players and fun and easy-to-play for younger gamers. Some of the mini-games can be frustrating such as the building mini-game, due to the number of times you will have to complete them during the game. All-in-all it was an enjoyable experience, and I would recommend to those who enjoy these kinds of games."

It basically follows the movie, scene by scene and adds more content through gameplay.I will say some of the instructions were lost on me until the very end.  Like how unikitty, when enraged can destroy gold blocks with her fire attack.Batman, can I say more?  Also you will find yourself using batman all the time.  His long range attack will destroy any item and send the bits directly to your collection, saving on collection time.Also unikitty's long range attack can be used to cheat a bit, since she will ""jump"" to the target, so if there is a destroyable item over a chasm, you can use her to reach it.The menus are not very informative, except maybe a few will say (laser) or some other attribute, but unless you know ""Ice Cream Jo"" can put out fires, you don't know why to ever use her.It's simple to play and dying isn't a problem.  Your characters can get destroyed all day long and nothing bad will happen."

Much. FUN.PROS:* It's funny as a spoof of the hero quests commonly found in fantasy games and novels;* Most of the dialogue is amusing, if not downright hilarious;* The co-op ""puzzles"" are superbly done and have a smooth complexity curve so you don't lose interest but aren't out of your depth;* It has plenty of minigames, including a few car(t) chases that are all unique enough to keep your interest;* The voice acting is amusing in and of itself: Morgan Freeman plays a very sarcastic blind/is-he-really-blind man, and I'm fairly convinced that Liam Neeson plays Bad/Good-but-kinda-crazy Cop. Whoever does the voice of Batman plays up his angst in well-timed and often hilarious over-dramatisation;* It's generally entertaining. It's wacky, weird and wonderful. I spent most of the time grinning because the characters (and plot) are all so ridiculously charming and funny.CONS:* There's no tutorial to teach you the controls. You get hints pop up from time to time, but they're kind of random and very location-specific: if you're not standing right on an activation circle, you'll miss the tooltip telling you which key to press to save the day. I did think this was a problem with the demo (since I've only ever played demos before and they've all had the same lack of tutorial), but the full game doesn't make any real attempt at teaching you how to move or which keys do what. I restarted the game a few times because I couldn't figure out how to ""Continue"" out of the summary screen and thought it had frozen up;* You can't reset the controls to suit you, and the default map just isn't that intuitive. In some instances, you skip cut-scenes or intro screens with U, but in others it's F2. Sometimes, you can exit with ESC, other times you need BACKSPACE. To ""continue"" out of a summary screen, you need to press J. Some attacks are interchangable with interactions (eg. Batman can use HorK to grapple some things, even though H is generally for attack and K generally for interaction)... The controls are already hard to remember because they're not intuitive (or commonly used), but when you add this interchangability, it becomes even more confusing.I may add more as I continue playing, but the pros so far outweigh the cons and I would recommend this game for anyone who wants to have a laugh while playing a game that doesn't take itself seriously. :D"

I'm not sure how much of this game is accurate to the actual movie, but it seems to be the entire movie.The gameplay is basically like any other LEGO game, but this one definitely seems to be geared more towards little kids compared to other LEGO games (I imagine it's because of the movie).If you're buying this for your kids, they'll definitely have a good time. The gameplay is easy, It's got plenty of characters, it's got all the strange cutesy things that kids are into nowadays. And the music will probably make you want to off yourself because your kids will play it on repeat for the next 5 months.If you're buying it for yourself as a 16+ year old, you'll probably enjoy going through the campaign, and netting yourself a few achievements along the way. You might even get a kick out of the music.If you're like me and buying it because you're a LEGO completionist. Do yourself a favor. Buy this game on sale, %100 it in a few hours. Shelf it. And never look at it again.Now we all know that LEGO games can be tedious, but this game for some reason seems like they cranked the tedium up to about 13. (I imagine to keep kids occupied).Getting %100 in this game was probably the worst experience I've ever had with a LEGO game. Just the mixture of the music, the cutesyness, and the overall fact that this particular LEGO game oozes the fact it's madespecificallyfor little kids made me hate every second that I was playing for the %100.So in summary, if you have kids this game will be great for them.If you're a grown adult, unless youreallywant the %100, buy one of the other LEGO games and save yourself some sanity."

An invigorating new title featuring an exceptional cast including Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Will Ferrell and more!As a prophecy fore-told of an individuals arrival, who of which is basically the most talented and most awesome person in the universe who will fall into the hands of the antagonist and save the day, an average joe known as Emmet was out of place when he fell into a circumstance. Emmet is a victim of this circumstance, seeking out his own curiosity where he takes on as much as an average joe can plus more. His quest begins when he meets Wyldstyle and falls out of line in what he's supposed to do and becomes a freelance side-kick.There's no doubt there's some similarities in political nature in this title between it and other games including Wolfenstein: The New Order and Abe's Oddysee among others. In this lego universe, it's enforced what an individual shoudl be doing, and for those that don't there's a system of control and elimination. The themes once put into perspective are quite dark, but it's told in such a way it's a good thing for a child to play, as it would enforce individualism and the benefits of being an individual. All is revealed in a very Matrix way when Emmet can see the whole universe and his maker, and he is transformed to a truly awesome individual.The game makes a lot of use of the third dimension and plays a lot with camera angled and it even features some 2D platforming areas. It is fantastic fun! Though I loved the entire game including the marvelous characters and story, I must gripe on the graphics rendering engine which feels stretched, rushed and cheap. Luckily it got significantly better after the prologue - as when playing this short segment it just didn't feel up to scratch. After the prologue though you wouldn't even notice this."

Liked this one a little better, not only because the of added movie clips, but the additional voices that exist throughout the game as well. Was better than the constant shrugging and mumbling of the other games. The addition of achievements was cool as well. As you opened up more characters, you opened up mkore sections to play in. Just found this more fun than the others as it seemed to not only  have more things to do but many more ways to do it. Was funny and addicting and very nice to look at.These games get better and better with each new addition. Hope that trend continues."

It's not a bad game but its not a great game either.  On first the run through  it follows the plot well, has the usual things you expect. The usual odd glitch is there (there really is no excuse for this anymore) but nothing you can not work around.However, once you run into freemode (with an intention to 100% the game) it becomes painfully obvious that the game was rushed to be released with the movie. In free mode all challenges are removed, especially once you unlock a flying character (which happens once you run through the game). There is no collection of mini kits like other lego games but rather 5 golden blueprints and a pair of pants (which serve no real purpose) each level. Where as other lego games take a lot to unlock red bricks and characters this game has no real depth in that area and 100%ing the game is fast and easy.This is exactly what let the game down for me more than anything. I like a bit of challenge in getting to that !00% mark and in this lego game there was none at all...but to be fair, I also feel like this lego game is geared towards the much younger players, where as other titles are fun for any age group.So, in closing, if you can pick the game up for £10 or under then by all means, its worth it, above that, it's overpriced."

If you didn't watch the movie, you'd only understand bits of the story that made the film good. If you watched the movie, which you should, that's less of a problem, but a little bugging nonetheless.Speaking of 'bugging', this game is the worst in terms of bugs that I've seen in the series so far.Went an unexpected way with a character? Restart level. Event simply doesn't trigger? Restart level. Stuff doesn't happen? Hack around in a way that shouldn't be necessary in order to not have to restart the level.But all the bad things aside, the Lego games by Traveller's Tales never really disappoint. Relaxed play through the story and an hour or two of fun studs grinding in the end... that's 15 hours until 100% with all achievements here.So if you watched the movie and liked it, you can't really go wrong when this game is on sale for seven bucks."

Even more fun if you have purchased a Lego Movie set that has a code inside to unlock secret characters. I have Emmet's Construct-O-Mech, which came with a code for unlocking Angry Kitty. Very fun to play as, especially when you consider that she gives early access to ""rainbow brick"" builds. (And the way she walks is simply adorable.)The only real problem I faced with this game is that it CRASHES MY ENTIRE COMPUTER EVERY TIME I ATTEMPT TO COMPLETE THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IN THE FIRST STAGE. The tutorial stage with Vitruvius, Cleopatra, and Shakespeare works fine, and I haven't run into any issues in the Bricksburg hub yet, even when playing as Angry Kitty, but in the stage ""Bricksburg Construction"" my screen turns pink and staticy every time I fix the ""delivery tube"" (or sometimes when I just get too close to it), which is literally the first objective in that stage. I am unable to switch programs or bring up a task manager when this happens, and attempting to wait it out results in my monitor becoming disconnected.In summary, great game with lots of fun characters and voice acting, if you don't mind not actually being able to play it.Edit: I managed to work around the bug, sort of. By maxing out the graphics options, I have moved the bug from a static location to random intervals. I can progress, but only a little bit at at time before the bug pops up and crashes my computer. What I have managed to play was fun, but I still can't recommend buying this bug-fest at full price."

This is obviously one of the weaker games in the LEGO Games franchise but still there is a ton of fun to be had.Pros:- Play with characters from the movie- A wide range of unique characters (Gandalf, Wonder Woman, Superman, Batman, Witch, Lord Vampyre, Swamp Creature, Robo Cowboy etc.)- A couple of hub worlds which are fun to play in- Fun gameplayCons:- As i said if you haven't watched the LEGO Movie before, watch it before playing this.

A ton of the LEGO Movies scenes were skimmed and some of the jokes are cut out.- There are a army of useless characters for some reason, Emmett has many variants that take up almost all of the top row in the character roster, even the Emmett that has a wheel on his head or a trashcan on his head.- As i said this is the weaker of the LEGO Games as there is not really much to find after you complete the main story, all the characters are found on the roster all you have to do it buy them, there is sidequests but they're mostly a little boring. The hubworlds are surprisingly small which is weird considering before this game was LEGO MARVEL Superheroes which is a wonderful game.My Rating: 7/10"

,Recommended,267530,31230196,Posted: 18 April,all,LegoGreenNinja12,"So I give this game a 7 to 8 ratings. Reasons are there are way to many damn glitches, some that gave me a ""heart attack"" a.k.a those damn cats. Anyways, most gltiches were easy to get rid of. Now the second reason is that it was VERY SHORT for a lego game, Other games has like 100 to 300 gold bricks..... this has 70 GOLD BRICKS!!!!!??? That surprised me. Final reason is the ""the depth lvl"", first time playing it with no red bricks to help you is really tedious of sort. after that is ok, anyways tht is my review"

The tutorials arent clear, sometimes you have to search for that one thing in the whole level, which is boring. The game is entertaining for small children, I guess. Anyway, if you're going to play it I recommend you watch the movie before you play it, at least you're gonna know whats going on. Not worth buying, in my opinion."

Took me about 24 hours to complete and get all achievements. I enjoyed the game but like the Jurassic World and Hobbit games better. I would recommend getting this if you like the lego series.If this is your first lego game, the controls do not use the mouse but instead use A, S, D, W and H, J, K, U to control the one character. I'm not sure the controls for two characters on the PC as I only play one character and then switch when I need to. Overall a good, fun game.If anyone's game is like mine to get the 'No Way, This is My Jam' achievement controls are from the console, which made it very difficult on the PC. To help the controls are A=J, Y=U, and X=H."
