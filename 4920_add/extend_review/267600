,Not Recommended,267600,8118211,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,[82DK] rhite,"Airport Simulator might be the most tedious and boring game ever released. Heres what you do in this game:1. Select gate for plane to taxi to.2. Extend tunnel.If its a passenger plane:1. Drive stairs to gate.2. Drive bus to gate.3. Drive luggage wagon to gate.4. Drive interior cleaning to gate.5. Drive exterior cleaning to gate.If its a cargo plane:1. Drive cargo wagon to gate.2. Drive exterior cleaning to gate.Wait 5-10 minutes1. Drive everything back to the garage.Thats literallyy it. Theres no management, there is no way to lose you just get money for every task you do. You start with 8 gates even though youre probably never going to use more than half of them at a time. You can hire ""helpers"" that drive the vehicles for you. The game is over once everything got an ""helper"". The graphics are bad but you cant really expect good graphics from a 15€ game.While playing it I got the feeling that devs were never even close to an airport. On what airport do they use tunnels and stairs/buses on the same plane? On what airport does the luggage go to end of the airport and the passangers to the other?The game is also riddled with bugs. When you save the game all textures and models unload and all you see is the skybox for about 3 minutes. The Tunnels jiggle all the time and get stuck inside the terminal. When i tried to taxi a plane back to the runway the game just crashed.Not only is this game awful it is also falsly advertised: It clearly says in the description that there are ""Many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways"" which there are none. Not a single one. It also says its available in german, french and italian which isnt the case either. Steam finally has to hire someone that plays every game for at least an hour before it is made available on the store.TL;DR Do not under any circumstances buy this game, dont even accept it as a gift."

And I like weird games, but this is just very strange. Going to play it a bit more and see what happens. If I understood the tutorial correctly I believe I have to earn money completing the driving tasks to pay other people to do the driving tasks for me. But the driving is the only thing you do in the game anyway? I guess if you like driving around airport vehices with poor physics and no damage model (that time I bounced off the passenger walkway with a bus full of people going to the terminal was a little scary, but I received no negative feedback), then this is the game for you.

Driving a few service vehicles aroung from garages to airpot gates and back. Once you have automated all but one task (for some reason loading cargo cannot be automated) you merely sit and watch the same things repeat over and over again. Your involvement is now over. The claim of countless missions is a lie and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves. There is one mission. It just repeats over and over again. Steam should remove this game from the option to buy if they are a responsible retailer. It really is that bad!!!

Sound only works if you adjust it to 2001 standards (so it matches the graphics). It's slow and boring. No way to speed up time.  All you do is drive around in excruciatingly slow airport support vehicles to a predetermined location and move on to the next vehicle. This must be done in a certain amount of time or else you start losing money. If you manage to actually make money, you can use it to ""upgrade"" each service, which simply automates it. So I guess the goal of the game is to upgrade everything to the point that it plays itself...  lame.Graphics and physics are waaay buggy.

I will happily play a game that most other people would call boring for HOURS.This game is too boring even for me.Based on the description, I was hoping things would pick up as I progressed in the game... getting to manage more functions of the airport, expand and grow it, improve it...  but what everyone else says about this game being primarily about driving exceptionally slow vehicles from point A to point B is absolutely true.  Really disappointed.I actually put my laptop on the coffee table and read a book while I waited for my next task to be ready.  Hooray, I can drive my fuel truck to the far end of the airport and park it!  Yay!"
,Not Recommended,267600,17112651,"Posted: 18 July, 2015",all,Tremelo,"This is a frustratingly uneven game. It starts off painstakingly slow: An aircraft comes in and you, apparently being the only person at the airport with a driver’s license, have to drive various vehicles to and from the plane: a passenger bus, a rolling staircase, a fuel truck, two types of cleaning trucks, a luggage trolley, etc.  It’s very tedious, but eventually multiple planes start arriving and you have to juggle various tasks among them. The plane at gate 5 is fueling now, the plane at gate 6 wants fuel next. A plane that just landed is waiting for a parking spot and you’re trying to push back a plane at gate 3 to make room for it. At this point the game isn’t exactly *fun*, but it’s at least involving. Get those tasks done to get the planes off the ground!But then you earn money and hire help and once you hire enough employees to handle every vehicle at every gate the game becomes nothing more than a slightly interactive screen saver: A plane lands, you assign it a gate and everything is taken care of. You just sit there and wait for it to take off again.There is one maddening exception: The pallet loader for cargo aircraft. You can’t hire anyone to drive this. It’s all you, and it's buggy and annoying. For starters, only one cargo plane can be serviced at a time. If you have 3 cargo planes parked at gates you'll only get loading/unloading instructions for one of them. You can entirely finish loading up the first plane but you won't be able to start loading and unloading the second plane until the first plane is on its way to the runway. It can sometimes take 10-20 minutes between the plane being loaded up and actually pushing back, during which time your pallet loader gathers dust and other cargo planes take up gate space waiting to unload. Additionally if you make the mistake of parking a cargo plane at gate 6, 7 or 8 you need to make ridiculous round trips back and forth across the tarmac between unloading a pallet on the south end, going to a parking spot on the north end, and returning to the cargo area on the south end again to pick the next pallet up (for gates 1-5 the parking spot is thankfully right next door to the cargo area so moving the pallet loader from the cargo area to the parking spot takes about 5 seconds).There are other frustrations too:+ Wonky physics that allow you to flip a plane nearly upside down with a nudge from a luggage cart+ Tasks that appear and disappear from your task list+ A non-intuitive interface+ An inability to move vehicles to a gate prior to a plane being assigned to it+ Awkward vehicle/gate rules. An aircraft can't push back until all of the vehicles servicing it have returned to their parking spots. It's not enough to simply clear the gate area. This makes multitasking difficult. For instance, say you're fueling a plane at gate 1 and when finished drive the fuel truck to gate 2 to service that aircraft. Even though the fuel truck is no longer at gate 1, that aircraft won't push back until the fuel truck has actually parked in the fuel truck area.For that small percentage of people who *really* like airports, there are bits and pieces of this game that are slightly interesting, but the bugs & game logic & freakin’ pallet loader make it nearly impossible to recommend."

,Not Recommended,267600,8507260,"Posted: 2 January, 2014",all,Griefix,"What seems to be another classic title from UIG - nice idea, poorly thought out, poorly implemented, not finished, a number of bugs impacting gameplay, and value for money is questionable at best.As a complete synopsis/walkthrough basically a plane lands, you allocate it to one of eight gates, and the plane is then serviced by a number of different vehicles.  Initially, you have to do all the driving, but you earn money for completing each vehicle task and receive larger cash injections when planes take off.  As you earn money, you can upgrade each of the vehicle tasks to automate the work three times, the only difference seems to be the speed in which the AI vehicles move.  Once you have upgraded all of the vehicle tasks once, everything is automated except for unloading/loading of cargo from/to cargo planes - which cannot be automated.  Once you have upgraded everything as far as it goes, the game ends, which took me about 18 hours, almost all of it waiting and watching.The description for this product is also misleading - super jumbos, there are none; coordinating air traffic controllers and technical staff, not in the game; organizing perfect catering, nothing beyond driving the vehicle from point A to point B; detailed and comprehensive simulation of events at an international airport, only if you think the only thing that happens is people driving vehicles; many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways, not in the game; and countless missions and tasks the player has to fulfill, only one ""mission"" which happens to be the objective of the game (to upgrade all automation tasks) and then the game ends.Overall the game barely held my attention, and only then because I assumed there must be something more to the game once the gate upgrades were done.  I was wrong, now I want my 18 hours back.  Might be worth it if the price drops to a couple of dollars, otherwise you're just wasting money."

Again, I was wrong. As you go on, the only way to get by is to automate the airport functions by hiring helpers. At first, they are desperately slow (you have to pay more to make them go faster) which frustrates you into upgrading everything as fast as possible. The problem is, you are effectively upgrading yourself out of the gameplay! There are perhaps 2 functions left that you have to do manually, and that's allocate a gate, and load/unload cargo. The latter is probably one of the more redeeming features of this game, in that the cargo lifter requires a little bit of effort as you have to line it up fairly precisely, and that it has some legitimate animation! If they had extended these features to more of the equipment, so you actually connected and sealed the stairs and the skybridges etc, I might have been inclined to stick around a bit longer.In summary, a bit tedious and a bit limited. Save your money...For the sake of constructive feedback to any of the development team who might see this (unlikely I know):Fix the bugs with the AI- they get close to their goal on some tasks and then just abandon it altogetherGive an option to take over automated tasks- In case of the above, I had no way to step in!Please extend the animations a bit!- Connecting the walkways, and seeing people in the buses can't be that hard to do if you can do containers in and out of a cargo hold!Find some form of expandability for once a player has automated the terminal.- Maybe designing and building a new terminal? Extending the current one? Upgrading equipment? Replacing old equipment with newer kit?!?There was a fair bit of potential for this game but it just fell short of my expectations, even for this price. Deep down inside I hoped it was going to be like 'Air Mogul' with the customisation of the buildings as well as the operation of the equipment, and i'd definitely come back to it if these things were patched in at some point, but for now, I bid you adieu, Airport Simulator 2014..."

If you however want to do something then this isn't that game for you, even if you want to browse the web or play something else while your waiting you can't because when you alt-tab or click outside the windowed version the time stops.The graphics aren't to bad and the gameplay is okay, its not overly buggy besides from some animations and things getting stuck when automated, but....It's very boring, very repetative and quickly loses  its charm.3/10"

,Not Recommended,267600,8150597,"Posted: 20 December, 2013",all,tty,"Terrible game. Basically, all you get to do is drive around various airport vehicles (stairs, buses, luggage carts...) and assign planes to gates. However, it doesn't really matter which gate you assign a plane to, and there's not much you can do wrong with driving the vehicles around. The ""management"" part of the game has you paying money for upgrades of the various vehicles, where the first upgrade automates a vehicle (you no longer need to drive it yourself, but you also can't take control if you want to), and subsequent upgrades speed up those vehicles.Automated vehicles are slower than manually driven vehicles (which are also pretty slow), so you might think you'd cleverly automate only some vehicles or some gates or what have you and do the rest by hand. However, as soon as you're using more than one gate, you run into a problem with manually driving the vehicles: you only get one of each type. So if you need, say, a passenger bus on gate two while it's already loading or unloading passengers on gate one, you're out of luck. But as you have a time limit for getting any vehicle in place, you'll probably end up driving the bus from plane one to plane two, then back so that unloading can continue - once an activity is started, there is no deadline, but they only continue if the vehicle is present. Except stairs. You can remove stairs and the passengers will continue loading from the bus into the plane.The strangest part about this ""game"" is that the aim of it is to make yourself mostly useless, as you're supposed to get all gates fully automated at upgrade level three. Obviously, just watching the game take care of the planes for ten to fifteen minutes at a time before you get to assign a plane to a gate (one click), then watch again, isn't really that much fun. Apparently even the developers realised this, so they gave us cargo planes. Unloading and loading cargo planes is the one thing you can't automate, so you have to drive the cargo lift yourself. It's a shame though that the game is only capable of keeping track of the loading state of one cargo plane at a time - if you have more than one cargo plane at a gate, the second (and third etc.) planes will have to wait until the first one leaves.The only thing you can do ""wrong"" in the game is be too slow getting a vehicle in place, which will result in money being subtracted from your account - one Euro per second until you get it done. Actually managing to be that slow is almost impossible though. One might think that as the frequency of landing planes increases, a penalty for not getting rid of planes fast enough will occur - not so. They will simply queue up on the taxiway until it is full if you don't assign them to a gate, and once it is full planes will stop landing.All in all, the only thing this ""Simulator"" simulates is a horrible attempt at making a game, but it simulates that very well."

This game is so slow that you can grow a beard that is 2 feet long before you complete the first challenge. I mean what else is there to say its so BORING! I have done household chores that are more fun than this game FOR REAL! Another thing is that they are charging $10 for this abomination of what they call a game.

I honestly can't think of anything positive to say about this game and most games that I end up getting that are bad I have at least one positive to them, but not this one. So why did I buy this then? Well have you ever looked for the worst possible game to play just becasue it is bad? I thought that I would get this game because it is literly the worst rated game on steam, its true just how many games are there on steam that have a overwhelmingly negative overall user score  almost none. So I bought it expecting that it would be a good laugh, but enjoyable for being so bad like the Tommy Wiseau's The Room is, instead I was crying and wishing that I had never spent my money on this garbage. I bought this before the steam refund ever existed so I was basically stuck with this thing. Overall don't buy this garbage of a game even if it is on sale you will just waste your money and if you think that it would be funny to send to a friend as a gag gift you would be a terrible person because it will basically give them cancer. There are SO many better games that you can get for $10 and even less.

I never post reviews when I should but if this review helps just one person save there money then I hope I accomplish that.Okay at first, I am a big fan of simulation games, and upon seeing this game released on sale I decided t give it a try. Upon opening it, I was brought to the main menu game was running smooth at this point no problems. I clicked on new game, and was brought to a cheap tutorial screen that did not explain anything outside of the fact ill win when i accumlate enough money to hire 3 star assisants.I was left to my own will to figure it out, so i decided i would give it a go. The world loaded, graphics are mediocre at best, I have seen worse. The first plane landed I was ready to go, I had to pick a gate for the plane to park in, I picked gate #7. The plane eventually made its way over to the gate and parked. A task list then popped up, this is where it takes a turn for the worst. My first task was to drive the gate tunnel to the plane. The controls for this are horrible and theres no explanation for it at all. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to line the tunnell up with the plane. Ok got that done, my next task was to drive the stairs over. I switched to the stairs, which were all the way on the other side of the airport. I started to drive over to the plane, in the slow slow vehicle. obviously i dont expect ferarri type speeds but it took me at least 3 minutes to get it over there. At this point im thinking okay, i hope it gets more interesting. Nope, my next task is to drive the bus over. Again its half way across the map. I drive it over park it. My next task is guess what? Drive the  mechanic van over. I did it.. My next task was? You guessed it.. I had to drive the luggage truck over.. With horrible vehicle controls on it, i made it over after almost flipping the vehicle about 19 times.. I was hoping i was done.. Nope, my next task? Drive the cleaning van over. I drove it over..My next task youll never guess. Nope not driving, It was waiting! I watched a timer count down from 8 minutes to 0 minutes to do guess what, Drive the bus over to the terminal. After doing that, guess what? I had to drive the stairs back, then the gate, then the luggage truck, then the mechanics truck and then finally i drove the cleaning van back.So long story short, if your looking for a annoying horrible physics less than ideal driving simulator that does not explain anything about game mechanincs then buy this. If your looking for an airport simulator look elsewhere.Pros:Sort of cheap price with the saleCons:BoringNo explanations of game mechanicsMediocre graphicsHorrible music something like elevator music."

Very cut and dry simulation.The UI in the game is clumsy at best, and is easily bogged down. There is very little instruction on what exactly needs to be done, and the ""goals"" in the game aren't explicitly clear. They also don't follow a linear progression of difficulty, because the first goal I recieved took a very long time to achieve, but the second was done within ten minutes.It is also not clear in any facet, how you are accumulating money. You just see random influxes of cash when certain tasks are completed, and other times when there is nothing to be done.Also, as much as I appreciate the fact that the larger automobiles in the game drive a lot clumsier than the smaller ones, it is totally unnecessary because the game is programmed that each vehicle has the same predetermined speed based on your skill with that task, and that only applies when you have a gate guy driving.On the whole, I find this game needs some work, and there needs to be more things to simulate. Like actually running the airport, inviting businesses in and take up real estate to pay you rent, getting other airlines into your airport, managing your monthly expenses, gas, fuel, workers salaries, etc...If it combined the data/financial savvy of a game like SimCity, with the easy playability of Airline Tycoon, and added some additional features like growth and expansion from a small airport to an International one, then this game would be golden.As it stands, I do not recommend this game."

Some tasks take 9 minutes to complete. That's 9 minutes in REAL TIME that you literally have to sit there and wait.

But it has to return to its parking lot first, otherwise plane 1 can not lift of. That itself would not be a great problem if all of the vehicles weren't THAT incredibly slow. So I drive across the airport for like an eternity to park my bus, just to make sure my plane 1 can start, and THEN drive back again to plane 2, that stands RIGHT BESIDES PLANE 1. Sigh...- Last part before starting a plane is to pull it from terminal to starting lane. So that's a great idea. Unfortunately the puller-car doesn't pull the plane at all. I parked it right where the game told me to, then drove of to the destination point... and the plane remained, where it was. Well... I tried, what I could do about that. And I ended up with pushing the plane all the way across the airport. Yet it has not arrived in its destination, but my car got stuck under the engine. Sigh...- You can buy employees to operate the vehicles. One at a time, three speeds each. I was happy to see the first vehicle operate by itself. It started its mission, drove off to the plane... and kept on driving... and driving... and driving... DAMMIT, these cars are SO DAMN SLOW! It might get faster, the better you upgrade them. But one step one it's another thing that takes forever. Did I mention, that the vehicles drive ultimately slow? Sigh...- Oh, and I accidently parked the car you can use to explore the airport somewhere wrong. On a road. It was wrong because the AI wasn't able to navigate around it. When it met my car, they had a quick ""bump"" and then the AI stopped. It didn't even try to drive around. OR EVEN PUSH IT AWAY! It just stood there and looked unsatisfied. But didn't even notice me about that problem. Wonder what happened if I didn't look after that one... Sigh...But well... in fact you can play it. If you get it started. And it doesn't stop while playing. And you don't get stuck. And there are no bugs that keep you from winning. And if you really enjoy to see planes leaping across the airport, right after you pushed them with your luggage-car. That was fun to see. But in fact it was a bit... disappointing, regarding to where the plane was intended to be. Sigh..."

A simulator would likely allow you to get inside the vehicles you drive, or even go inside the buildings. This dosent do much. Certain aspects are broken. Like taking the plane taxi and moving the plane in place for takeoff. On my first try I flipped the plane several times. In order to move the plane you have to ram the wheels. Yes ram a airplane full of passengers which can cause a flip. If it was real life there would be no survivors. Another thing is when you first get in its very confusing and you get lost in certain aspects pretty quick. A simulator is expected to be like the real world. This dosent even come close. You technically dont hire people at all. You make upgrades which actually are helpers which actually do all the driving for you. Once you get to a certain point, the game literally plays itself. You dont have to do anything except tell the planes what gate to go. What would make a airplane simulator fun would allow you to build buildings, put in shops and organize how your main buildings process new custormers, buy airplanes, hire employees for various jobs, and even design your airstrips. This game has none of that and cannot be recommended. Out of 5 I give this game a 1.5.  It earned a .5 for not being 100% broken."
,Recommended,267600,17645297,"Posted: 21 August, 2015",all,RolanDecoy,"Though somewhat outdated (even at the moment it was launched) I must admit it is strangely addictive. Maybe it is because of the mindless tasks you need to fullfill or the soothing music, but one of the game producers is called Insomnia, which should give some hint to how much it will demand from the gamer.The graphics are rather good and the music is excellent, though very repetative since it's only 1 or 2 tracks. You are in charge of the loading, unloading, fueling, repairing and pushing back airplanes at an airport. This is easier than it sounds, since all you have to do is drive vehicles to their marked parking spots next to the airplane, at their (un)loading docks or garage. With the exception of the cargo loader for cargo planes and the taxi used to push an airplane from the gate to the taxi strip, the occasional upgrading of vehicles so that not you but an NPC gets to those jobs and assigning a recently landed aircraft to a gate there really isn't all that much you can do.I found it addictive though, and with a little program called Voice Attack I don't even have to touch my mouse / keyboard unless I assigned an airplane to a gate which has no NPC's. Ow yes, almost forgot, the cargo loader for cargo airplanes cannot be automated, so at least you can do that manually.It still has a lot of potential and a future version 2015 or 2016 I wouldn't mind playing. I recommend this only because I have fallen slave to it, but I think most people would rather play something where you actually have to DO something."

You repeat the same tasks over and over to service planes, and once you upgrade all the gate equipment, its mostly all automated so there is really nothing to do.  There is no management and business options for the expansions of terminals and runways as promised by the developer.  There is only one possible airport to ""manage"" and there is no ability to build or run any of it except for basic gate operations.I played for a while because it sort of was a stress reducer and easy game, but then I encoutered bugs that prevented my from going forward such as poor vehicle physics and concurrent cargo planes that got stuck at the gates and would not let me unload them.  The game gives you one mission, which is to upgrade all the equipment at all eight gates to level 3 using money you earn from servicing planes.  There are no challenges, no random events, no real strategy, and no tutorial for just starting out.  Additionally, the graphics are crude and there are no people ever visible in the entire airport except for the drivers of vehicles.I really think an airport simulator could be a great game if it could be done right.  Managing gates, terminals, shops, parking, traffic, runways, security, and air traffic control could present a truly emmersive real-time strategy game.  This game shows little to no effort to attempt to capture such a strategy.

Also, the aim of the game is to hire ai controlled assistants to complete tasks for you, but for me they just glitched all over the place.

After purchasing Airport Simulator 2014 and sinking about 23 hours in it, I felt highly disappointed for the following reasons:- There is only ONE airport that you can play with, it has 8 gates and when those are filled there's a nice queue of 5 aircraft so you'll never run out. They never start moaning about the waiting times either, keep that in mind for the next point.- You can drive 12 vehicles around the apron. You only get one of each and many aircraft need the same vehicles at a time. This could get a bit hectic, if it wasn't for the patience of the waiting pilots. Just drive your vehicle from gate 1 to gate 2, and maybe to 3 and 4 as well, just to make your time deadlines, then get back over at gate 1 and do the actual work etc.- This all gains you small bits of ""money"", and a good sum when a processed aircraft takes off, which you can then use to hire drivers for 11 of the vehicles, for each gate specific. Funny, as these drivers come with their own vehicles, so gates don't have to share a single vehicle anymore. Drivers come in three skill levels, you start with the slow ones and go up to the faster ones. (Yet the vehicles still drive at the same pace!) The 12th vehicle is a cargo container loading platform, there is no driver available for that so you have to keep doing this until the end of times.- After earning enough ""money"" to upgrade all your drivers, you get a ""Well done!"" message, saying that your drivers are now fully automated and you can either return to the main menu or keep playing to load/unload cargo planes.- There is no way of expanding your terminals (you only have one, and it disappears after a while!) or extending your runways. It is however advertized as such in the game description in the Steam store. False advertizing!Conclusion: think I am going to make a couple of screenshots and then use the false advertising as reason to ask for a refund. I strongly suggest you do not buy this game."

I honestly feel like an idiot for paying anything, let alone $15 for this.The main issue that has made me throw up my hands and say ""I'm done."" is the bugs. It came to a point where I literally could not continue playing the game because of a bug with the Tunnels, or Aerobridges as they're probably better know as. Upon looking at the community hub this is a widespread issue with the only fix being crashing another vehicle into the bugged tunnel and hoping to dislodge it.In terms of gameplay the vast majority is literally driving aircraft service vehicles (eg. Catering Trucks, Tugs, etc.) from point A to point B, leaving them there for several minutes then driving them back to point A. While the coordination of this to get planes in the air again as quickly as possible did get me to use my head at times, the lack of variation and visible rewards really kill any prospect of this being a game you'll ever touch again after a day or two.Pricewise I'd say if you were -absolutely- desperate to experience the badness of this game, do not pay a cent more than $5 and thats probably being way too generous.While I am legitimately interested in the goings-on of airports and really would absolutely love to see a simulation game that can truly reflect the experience, this is not it.

,Not Recommended,267600,29773255,Posted: 7 February,all,Scythan,"Plays more like someone figuring out how to use Google SketchUp than any kind of entertainment experience at all. Truly a squandered opportunity that should, in all earnestness, be removed from Steam for sheer inane ""gamelessness"". There are bugs, but beyond that there's no real content. No simulating of an airport, I spek truth when I say that I have played iOS games that do a better job of simulating airline management than this title. If I had bought it after the 'two week refund' I would have given this back in a heartbeat. The only title absolutely hidden off my list. I cannot discourage enough. Perhaps the real pain is that there is so much potential in the setting. Whatever potential, it was squanderd."

You just drive around the airport cars and trucks then wait for about 6 REAL TIME mins before you get to do anything.Overall... waste of money, not even worth the $7.49 I paid on sale."

I have always been a huge fan of everything aircraft related, I even worked at an airport for a time.  This ""game"" was more tedious than any day I ever worked.  Very slow pace, very boring gameplay.  Laughable controls as you move each service vehicle to and from the aircraft, one...at...a...........time.And as I was almost finished servicing the first aircraft, I thought to myself, ""I think I will cheat some cash to automate this crap.""  Yep, thinking about cheating to automate a game in less than one hour because it was so boring.  Not a good sign.Controlling the different vehicles is a matter of using the up arrows.  Everything moves at the same slow pace, turning is unrealistic, no damage models, of course.The gameplay is simply telling the plane where to park.  Then you move the ramp to the plane.  Move the stairs, move the bus, move the cleanign crew, move the maintenance crew, move the caterer, move each one back on at a time.  Repeat on the next plane....and the next...and the next...Was it worth the $7.49 I paid?  Hell to the no.  This would have worked better as a free-to-play with a 99 cent option to automate the trucks."
