The chainsaw gives you the most money per tree, everything else earns you less so there is no point in buying machinery. You also move the fastest while on foot, when strafing, the vehicles are super slow. Oh and you also fall through the terrain constantly, there is even a button for resetting your vehicle when it happens so it's not like the developers didn't know about it.Update: Still bad."

You wonder who you are and how you got there, and why you are standing next to three recycle bins. You see a tree and you decide you want to cut it down. You run up to it in super lag at 1fps and try to stick the chainsaw which you don’t know how you got into the tree. You try to start the chainsaw but it says you are holding the chainsaw in the wrong position. So you give up and decide to explore. But then, all of the sudden, you feel the need that you need to cut down some trees. You have no way of getting this information, you just know in your mind that you must cut down three trees. So you decide to cut down these trees and you realize that you can run faster sideways than you can forwards. You don’t know why, you just do. In your head you visualize a map. You have no way of getting this map, you just picture it (in the top-right corner of your screen). You run to this place where you feel the trees are and you magically stop. You have reached the end of the world. Small world right? Then you turn around and you see a hideous, very scary sight. You see…a mountain that is literally covered in trees!!! Then you see a crane and decide to jump in it so that you don’t have to look at that hideous mountain anymore. You don’t know how you got in it or what you pressed, but you’re magically in the crane. You can’t get out. You’re stuck. The game is over.Second In-Game Adventure: You start out as a random guy with a chainsaw standing in front of a house and you see that you are next to four recycling bins. You once again wonder who you are and how you got there, and why there are now four recycling bins. Maybe the garbage man came and dropped off another one? These questions remain in your head leaving you in confusion. You see a tree once again and you decide you want to cut it down. You think that maybe this time the chainsaw will actually start…You thought wrong. Once again the chainsaw doesn’t move. You decide that maybe this tree just has problems and doesn’t like you so you decide to run away from this tree that doesn’t seem to like you and you run up a hill. You then remember that you can run faster sideways than you can forwards. You don’t know why, you just do. So you awkwardly run sideways until you come to another tree. You think that this one looks more friendly and will want to be your friend so you can cut it down…You thought wrong. As soon as you get up to the tree and raise your chainsaw, the tree pulls you into it. You don’t know how, since you were standing about 5 ft. away from the tree. How can this be? You are stuck with these puzzling questions waiting to be answered. Anyway, the tree pulls you into it and you go into the tree. You don’t know how, all you know is that you are now inside the tree. But then, things get much more scary. You then fall out of the tree and start falling into a world of whiteness. You look up and you can see that you have fallen out of the world. You can see the bottom of the world fading as you fall farther and farther into the world of whiteness. You look down into the whiteness. It looks very…white. But then, as you start to think that things can’t get any worse…You thought wrong. Black and white lines cover up your screen. Everything fades. The game crashes. You are back at your desktop. Worst simulator game ever…"

,Not Recommended,267610,8117222,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,jungle.james,"Woodcutter Simulator 2013's environment is very pastoral and eerily serene. Set in a presumably German valley, the player can hear a constant and unyielding cacophony of chirping of birds in the distance.With regard to the presentation of violence against trees, you're limited to accepting a contract with specifically designated markers. In order to fulfill this, the player walks towards the tree, checks the radar on the bottom right, and begins to rip into that deciduous flesh. Upon felling the great beasts with the chainsaw you'll hear their moaning creaks and be treated to a third person perspective of the tree collapsing.Unfortunately the engine does not model physics too well and you're not free to hack away at trees. The act of cutting down a tree is simply a matter of pressing a button and watching an animation. So with all of this in mind I'd say that only simulation devotees and people like myself who enjoy investigating the curios of Steam should pick up this title."

Its true that I have not progressed very far however I feel the game lacks polish. It was glitchy and crashes anytime i plug in the power cord while running on battery. I also wound up walking on top of trees after finding I was unable to climb up a hill trying to get to my objective. The game and interface are not very intuitive. Figuring out where to go on the tiny minimap is confusing (the tutorial is no help being simply a series of 20 second text overlay videos pointing out UI elements), and once you do reach an area figuring out how to use the chainsaw is frustrating. Once you do it simply turns out to be finding the right spot to stand and pressing the action button, no skill or planning involved. The game would certainly be a lot better if it had a more open world sandbox feel. If I were Stihl I would be dissapointed that customers were having this experience with the starting chainsaw being prominently branded. I hope it gets better as I am able to purchase higher end equipment."

Trees fall after being murdered cut down by our hero. He is a magic hero, after the tree cut is finished he vanishes and then uses his magical powers to make all of the limbs off the tree, at times spending the trunk rolling across the map.However, he is a simple man. I started the game expecting a machine like in the movie Fern Gully that let me just drive around and collect some wonderful trees. The game said no to my dreams, handed me a chain saw and hyperflexible arms and told me to get to work. After cutting down three trees and using explosive magic to remove the limbs, I was told to go clear some underbrush.Waiting for Rain Forest Destory 2014, but Woodcutter Simulator 2013 meets my tree killing needs for now."

I bought this game with childish glee, and literally could not wait to rev up my chainsaw and get to some cuttin'. My enthusiasm, however, was quickly curbed when I got into the game ""proper"". Words fall short when trying to explain this atrocity, invisible walls are everywhere, the chainsaw is considered a ""vehicle"", and the player strafes faster than a bullet train.It even managed to remove any aspect that makes woodcutting so interesting to begin with, even felling a tree is just an animation that you have no control over. This game truly is the ""Big Rigs"" of the simulator genre, albeit blotted of any conceived notion of entertainment. Buying this, even as a joke, is nowhere near worth it."

Although my Intel HD 4000 card is quite adequate to play Portal and Demolition simulator at full resolution. For Woodcutter you need a high end card.* You have no control over the tree chopping process which is automatic once you have lined yourself up in front of the tree. At this point you may wish to have a tablet or book to hand to entertain yourself while the tree is being felled. Each tree takes 2 or 3 mins to fell.* If you buy the tractor chainsaw you might think you would be able to chop trees down more quickly to accelerate advancement though the game, but no, it actually makes tree felling slower.  This is because it takes much longer to line yourself up by the tree and the felling process is more or less the same. Just going into reverse takes a few seconds to achieve.* After felling many trees you finally have the chance to own a logging truck and the prospect of doing something else besides watching the chainsaw on autopilot. This you are promised in the manual. YES!. But wait, the assignments are exactly the same as before. I tried a few. I contacted support about this and they assured me the assignments would change after a while. 5 or 6 assignments later, and still I only get trees to chop down. Sorry I am completely bored out of my skull and can no longer bear to play your stupid game.* UIG support is slow to respond and not very helpful."

Amirite?But when I loaded up this ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" little woodcutting game I immediately felt like Judas was to Jesus. How could I hate and laugh at something so beautiful? The main menu is sublime, the quaint melody and the beautiful scenery made me feel like a child again. I shed a tear, called my family into the room and offered them the greatest pleasure of viewing this masterpiece alongside me. Of course, while initially sceptical they accepted.Upon choosing the single player option you can choose to play either a tutorial or go straight into the main campaign. As I didn't want to keep my audience waiting I chose to jump right into the fray. It was nothing like I expected, there was no waking up, grabbing a cup of tea and calling the wife before setting out to chop wood. Your one and only goal was to chop wood meaning in a dark souls-esque style you wouldn't be able to prepare for the oncoming mission beforehand due to it's open world nature. I was beginning to feel foolish in front of my family for not choosing the tutorial but to my surprise it was all explained in game anyway! After being issued a mission ""Kill 4 trees"" a picture of a tree on the minimap directed me to my goal and I ventured to it on foot.*30 minutes later*After reaching the tree marker I was instantly admist a sea of trees larger than those seen during my adventure to the goal. This was the place, the place of do or die. Walking to my first cuttable tree (you can only cut trees with bands around, showing the care for enviornmental safety this game has - a vital feature to stop people imitating the game on any random tree) I pulled out my chainsaw and felt a thrill. This was my first kill. Watching the gruesome yet wonderful animation (lasting approximately 7 minutes) the tree had fell and disappeared but regardless of reasons my objective of killing four trees was marked ""1/4"". A wry smile and a strange bloodlust filled me as I continued towards the other trees. ""2/4"", ""3/4"", ""4/4"" and I was done.I felt like a god returning to base. I held the fate of those marked trees and I could sense the fear within them. I killed a few more to make an example to those who would dare rebel, keeping my people (trees) safe from those anarchists. At that point I decided to turn off the simulator, for if I strike the wood too often my people would live in fear.The true addiction to this God Simulator lies in the multiplayer. Will the kind, foolish god win the support of the people or will the more assured, logical god win the rise to power? Of course I already know the answer.I don't want to rate this game as I no longer consider it a game. But to all who purchase it be warned for I am God in this world. Fear me. Loathe me. Envy me."

I hope not, because once you set the cardinal direction you are looking with the mouse, you're locked on.""Wanna go for a walk?""A more accurate title may have been, ""Walk around with a chainsaw simulator"" you will spend more time wandering around the map getting to the objectives than actually performing them.  Your walking speed is painfully slow, your sprinting speed is rediculously fast.  Really, why would I buy a van to deliver myself and supplies to the jobsite when I can run there faster and my legs never need repairs?Safety last!The game makes an utter mockery of safety.  You are felling trees, what would you wear?  At least stick with the stereotype and give me a flannel shirt!  I get the impression you are out felling trees in a t-shirt and shorts, hell, you might even be wearing flip-flops (you can't see your feet, which is probably for the best) As you cut the tree, the cutter keeps the bar only half-engaged in the wood, just asking for a nasty kick-back, and hey, what are wedges? who need one of those? If you are going to simplify gameplay to the point of being no-fun at all, at least be safe and accurate!Booooring!You know what the most exciting part of felling trees is?  It's the art and science of cutting the tree, getting it to fall with the lay of the rest of your cut logs, gaging the wind, slope, and making precise cuts to guide the tree onto your targeted bit of ground.  They took all this skillful operation of an exciting bit of equipment, and pared it down to a cutscene.  Not a particularly good cutscene.  If I didn't have practical experience, I'd be led to believe that Stihl makes giant red markers, because that's obviously not a kerf you're leaving on the tree! In the height of opposite-land, while it takes you a painfully long 30 seconds to make your face cut and back cut, limbing the tree (the longest and most boring part in real life) and makes it the part you look forward to, because it means you again have control, and can walk up to a tree and push a button... wait, you won't look forward to that.Graphics, does anyone have any graphics?The max resolution is well below my standard screen resolution, and with all the graphics cranked to max, well, it's lackluster.  You'd think a chainsaw would call for some visible particle effects, but I guess they wanted to reinforce the idea that you're just drawing red lines on the tree.Heavy EquipmentYeah! heavy equipment, maybe they skimped on the chain saw parts to emphasize equipment operation, right?  WRONG! the heavy equipment is as irritatingly over-simplified as the rest of the process, and as boring to use.I've owned this game for half an hour, and I already have buyer's remorse... did I mention I got it on sale? If this game was free to play, it would be over-priced.  You should be paid to play it.  Save your $5, if you want to waste time, there are many actual games that can waste it more enjoyably."

It's not the right way... it does have the concept but you will hurt yourself and or someone or even a building. I'm certified by the US Federal Service chain saw and I'm Giving you a Warning!! I dis Aprrove that they show because the angle is to deep and you DO NOT cut threw the ridge. What happened to using the GUNNING SIGHT? UGH This games a fail...... Also why cant you use a wedge and a felling axe to Aid your felling. Just take the UBAN FORESTRY class and CHAIN SAW CERT and then think about felling a tree. Thx

,Recommended,267610,9671205,"Posted: 29 March, 2014",all,the1observant,"WARNING: If you're looking for an easy out-of-box type of experience, then stay away from this Sim.Do I recommend this game?... 50% Yes, and 50% No. If Steam used a Star Rating, I would give it 2.5 of 5 Stars. It's a love / hate relationship. I love the idea of this Sim, the creativity it involves, the scenery, the sounds of nature, and the sounds of machinery. It has free play value, or you can create your own strategy of how to complete a task.But, I do hate the technical difficulties the Sim dishes out and you have to waste time fixing them. It's sad you have to do such things on something you paid for. On the other hand, recovering from an object collision detection error has a challenging element of it's own. Some errors you can fix within seconds, others may take minutes.After ironing out the graphical errors and finding the right settings that work best, it's a pretty fun Sim. However, I'm a ""chill out"" type of Sim person to begin with and I have patience with editing game files. I'm a hobby programmer, so I have an unfair advantage other gamers don't have.I would also like to point out I've discovered there are 2 different sub-versions of Woodcutter Sim 2013 that both say they are version 1.0.0.6. One version does not include the Flatbed Truck, but the Steam version does. For some people that might not be saying a whole lot, considering it was a last minute add-on that wasn't planned out very well. For one thing, the engine tune sound does not change while driving the Flatbed. Another thing, the trailer has Drive Wheels instead of Free Wheels, which tend to push the tractor over in both slow and fast turns. However, this does amount to combined horse power so you can climb hills faster while transporting the Feller. On the other hand, it's hard to drive the Flatbed around tight corners in reverse because the 2 Drive Chains work against each other. So, there's advantages and disadvantages to work with there. You have to compromise with strategy and learn the terrain.The PhysX for the Sim was not coded for entire realism, but you do get the ""jest"" of things while operating the machinery. You will not find proper weight and mass PhysX in Woodcutter, nor any of the previous Sims released by UIEG. The collison detection still needs lots of work, because you should not be able to fold a tractor parallel to the trailer, that's just absurd. You also should not be able to drive a Utility Van into a Feller at ground level and cause the Feller to fall over, but I guess I'm just nick-picking now... lol.Speaking of those Collision Detection errors... If you play Woodcutter using the default settings, then there's a high probability you will experience gradual degrading functionality. Especially with the logs, trees, and vehicle tires. Sure, everything starts out great, but eventually the game engine is going to ""burp"" and you'll find yourself fighting with the Self-Loader Truck while attempting to pick up ""ghost"" trees or logs. The crane clamps will begin to pass completely through the objects for no apparent reason. Sometimes shutting down the Sim and restarting it fixes the glitch, but it's not always going to work like that. The same is true for vehicle tires when they find an invisible hole in the pavement to fall through or get stuck in (restarting the game might work, might not). Paying for vehicle assistance sometimes proves to be a failure as well and you'll still find yourself restarting the game to fix it. You might find yourself dropping trees straight through the ground, or see a tree bobbing around in the grass like a fishing cork. You might even discover an invisible object in a place where it wouldn't usually be as you slam into it while moving around in the forest and it causes you to dump your load. Sawmill logs might magically vibrate themselves straight out the end of the trailer and you'll have to gather them back up. If you put trees in the yellow log truck, they might slip backwards as if they are sitting on grease (what happened to tie downs?). You can press the ""1"" key to jump out of the Self-Loader Truck and your shoulder can tap the tractor and cause it to flip over on it's side, then you have to work the crane again and push the tractor back over. Luckily the trailer is more durable and allows the tractor tires to pass straight through the front-end... LOL... but don't count on it, you can still lose your load in the process. I could go on and on over the crazy things I've seen in this Sim, but the point is to be careful and be aware these things can happen. Save your game often and name them so you'll know where to start over at, if you have to.There is something you can do to help avoid the glitches more often. Search the WoodCutter discussion threads on Steam for the file ""device.icom"" (notice the period) and you'll find instructions. Basically you have to turn down the graphics and increase the refresh rate.You can also use cheat codes to help you get out of a jam, so also search for ""cheating.login"" (notice the period) and you'll find instructions for that too.What is this Sim worth? As it stands now, probably $2.49 and lot's of patience. At least you get material to work with, but you have to figure out how to make it run better."
