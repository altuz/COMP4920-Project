For me, this game is a masterclass in focussed design.  It doesn't try to be clever, with lots of gimmicks that are only there for their own sake.  It just gives you good, solid, arcade-style action, and it does it extremely well.  Your mech isn't loaded with three dozen special features that you completely forget about in the heat of the action.  It does a limited number of things, but those are the only things you need it to do, and they all feel relevant.  Running, strafing, transforming, boosting, barrel-rolling to dodge fire, and all the while firing, firing, firing on the enemy.Yes, it does betray it's Xbox origins in the slightly awkward mouse control and limited graphics options, but honestly, once you dive in and get blasting, it all feels very natural.  The barrel-rolling to dodge in jet mode feels particularly intuitive, as it's on the keys you use for strafing in mech mode (A and D by defaut as you'd expect).  And you can always plug a control pad in if you find the mouse control a bit too hazy.As far as I'm aware there's only one voice in the game, the guy who gives you orders, and he puts in a good performance.  Maybe not award-winning, but solid, with simple dialogue, no ridiculous cringe-inducing histrionics, and status updates and encouragements as you progress through each mission.  It's nice to actually be told you're doing well instead of being berated for something or other all the time! =PIn closing, if you want some simple, straightforward action with just enough depth to be engaging without being overwhelming, Gun Metal is for you."

Bought it on the premise of being a mech and fighter jet.  Not disappointed, at all.It's short, with about 4 hours of gameplay but it delivers solid fun.  It's not overly complicated and does not try to be so and it's honesty is laudable.Trust me, get it.  Good arcady action that you'll lose yourself into and now it has Steam cards, for all those Steam aficionados like me.Addendum: For those other reviews mentioning the control scheme, it's better to use mouse and keyboard than controller plug-in.  With M+KB you can aim with more precision, they aiming reticule is not locked to nose only (you can shoot in 30-45 degress to the sides, up and down while flying forward)."

This game is far more action-heavy in it's content, and it's controls are far better than the Robotech games on the consoles by a long shot.Piloting a morphing mech is always a trip, but doing it in such style is glorious. Yes, I know that this game was very poorly optimized for the timeframe (og. Xbox optimized), but there's no excuse not to pick this up and give it a whirl if you have a fairly modern system (eg. 2007 or newer, runs well on my laptop with integrated).Combat is tight and well thought out, there's plenty of challenge, and the variety in the missions is fairly done. And it's graphics are quite nice for the age of the game, to say the least.If you're a mecha fan, and have a love for this style of gameplay, drop the money on this, you won't be disappointed."
,Recommended,267920,17718268,"Posted: 25 August, 2015",all,Marco Antonio II.,"I never played this game on the original console so my opinions are about the PC port alone and I've never played it before until recently.The game has a very straightforward concept where you pilot a giant robot that can also transform into a jet. While the concept is simplistic the execution is good enough to make the game entertaining and quite unique. In all missions you are introduced right into the action (After a quick mission briefing) and you’ll have to destroy enemy buildings as well as their vehicles using a variety of weapons you’ll unlock as you play. If you’re satisfied by this simple concept, you won’t be disappointed. The game doesn’t have much of a plot other than having you defend your base and destroying the enemy, and sadly the game isn’t very long being a 4-6 hour experience, but it allows you to replay the missions as you unlock them, most of the missions being quite open to different alternatives to go through them due the transforming mechanic, the weapon variety and the size of the maps.The controls might be very clunky on the start (Especially the mouse controls) and I won’t judge the people saying it felt unplayable, it takes some time and effort getting used to it but it’s worth it and doesn’t take long to get used to the controls on both the giant robot and the jet, both which control differently and have their ups and downs on their gameplay. Customizing the controls is not hard either, and it didn’t took me long to find the most comfortable settings to play the game with, and I used a keyboard all this time. Give it some time and you’ll blast enemies with accuracy soon enough.There’s no difficulty setting in this game, but the game’s only difficulty felt fair, challenging but not frustrating. The enemies are a bit bullet spongy, but as you unlock better weapons it becomes easier to get rid of them as well destroying everything around you. Some weapons felt a bit lame, but it also counts with many satisfying weapons that makes you feel like you’re in a Michael Bay film because of all the explosions and destruction you’ll be causing around you, and this game has plenty of destructible environments.It’s a solid experience for those fans of action games and giant robots but it’s not flawless. Some weird experiences I had with it is that the mouse doesn’t work during the steam overlay, and any key you press during the overlay that triggers an action in the game will still work, so you can still play with the overlay open which can be annoying if you need to send a message.All in all, I’d recommend buying it during a sale considering its limited length and some of its simplicity, but it was a great throwback to simpler times and I am extremely satisfied with the game."

It isn't on par with, say, the Mechwarrior series as far as mecha games go. It is fun though, and imo it's one of the better mecha shmups.

No quality control here? Not even the wizards from the modding community. Game isn't popular enough. Firstly, run GunMetal.exe on compatibility mode with XP and run as administrator. The ""joystick problem"" also has some workaround, go to options and If you're on a joystick and if you want to use your analog buttons, you Just hold the desired trigger by half (like a soft push) before the button assigment until the option detects it. You release the trigger slowly when ready. If holding by half doesn't work during the assigment, just press it down fully again, before prompting, and release it when ready and it might detect your analog trigger as a common button.Now are you reviewing this thing man?There is moreVortexfor the old Snes in here thanMetal Headfor Genesis 32x...Okay enough with this oldschool talkThe gameplay is original. I never saw a fast paced mechanic like that before, high on coffee. - Gun down couple of tanks *switch to a ship, go Dalton* - Back to Optimus Prime mode, protect the target, fly back again, switch again, land again... You save the world just to be locked on the asylum later.Music is techno but not ravey or silly, it's fast paced like the game is. People complain that it is too hard, go play Super Mario Bros. Game will punish you. If you don't like to work under pressure yousissibetter forget Gun Metal. Like when you go to some boot camp and quit coward because you can't concentrate with a maniac officer shouting at your ear. The challenge is awesome.

Which makes it even more fun, in my books!Of course this is an older title, so dont expect cutting edge tech on the graphics front, having said that this more than stands the test of time, and going from uber speedy jet to walking tank of doom is very satisfying.You almost definetly wont be happy with the standard control setup, but just play with the sensitivity settings in game and you can make it feal right very easily.Storyline isnt Oscar winning material but is more than fine and does help to set up some sense of urgency on certain missions.Overall, damn good fun and after clocking it is still one of those ""load in for 10mins, blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, log off"" kinda of games."

It took round three hours to complete Gun Metal, but during these I had a lot of fun. The only thing that you do in Gun Metal is destroying your enemies with more and more powerfull weapons. From dual machine pistols to rocket launchers about a variety of energy based weapons and air to ground missiles you have a very big veariety of weaponsto choose from. Although you can pretty clearly see that Havoc Suit focusses more on ""classic"" weapons like the machine pistols or grenade launcher the Jet mode has more missiles and air to ground weapons at his disposal. Sometimes I felt that there even are to less weapons suited for air combat, but then again you can also use air to ground weapons to bomb bigger enemy ships in mid air, which is pretty effective. Alternatively you can land on them as well. The missions in the agme are not very hard, just at the end they became a bit tricky, because you have multiple things happening at once.  But even so when this sounds negative the game is pretty fun. Easy but fun. I wouldn't buy it for 10 euro though. But during a sale for 5€/$ it's pretty nice."

,Recommended,267920,30495213,Posted: 13 March,all,Dirk Dickbutt,"Gun Metal is pretty cool, I guess.Set in the distance future of 2002, Gun Metal came out during this weird time when Xbox games were surprisingly experimental.You play as a pilot of the Havoc suit, a mech that can change between a humanoid form and a jet form, and totally isn't like the Valkyrie from Macross. The game has an actual story, but I had to dig up a wikipedia article on the game to actually get it outside of mission to mission stuff.Humanity has sent out ships to colonize a new world, but these ships were tailed by an enemy alien fleet hellbent on destroying the new colony. So it's up to you piloting the Havoc suit to protect the colonists and defeat a tireless enemy that fires red lasers while you fire blue lasers.Transforming the havoc suit is as easy as pressing a button, with both forms having their own set of weapons. While it's implied that ground form is used to fight land units while flight form is used to fight air units, there's a surprising amount of options given to you.You unlock more weapon to choose from as the game progresses with both forms having four or five weapons each. It's just as easy to carpet bomb an area of enemy tanks as it is to transform mid air, land on an enemy ship, and just aim down and fire.Which I do, all the time. Because it's radical.Aiming and shooting takes a few moments to get accustomed to. And much like my violent alcaholism, you just need need to get used to it. Your crosshairs move around the screen, and the mech doesn't turn until the crosshairs reach the edge of the screen. It's kind of reminiscent  of other games from the same genre, but just how wonky is feels at first could throw you off.Luckily, it doesn't take long to get use to and you even kind of appreciate it being there. It means you can keep your eye on all of your targeted enemies instead of having to look away and hoping your missile still meets its mark. Like eating a sandwich in front of a pack of hungry racoons, you just know the second you take your eyes off them they'll attack.Gun Metal actually reminds me of another game that came out around the same time, a game kind of lost to time known as ""Battle Engine Aquila."" or something along those lines.Looking deeper into Gun Metal and the time it was released I was actually surprised to find out that some graphics cards at the time actually released packed with Gun Metal and BEA together.Now isn't that neato burrito.But should you play Shoot Copper?It's a neat little gem, thats to be sure. It crashed on me a total of one time and then never again. The bloom from the sun on this game is absolutely brutal though, so you may want to turn it off. I didn't because I'm a big strong man.The maps are actually fairly impressive, even though they reuse them a bunch. It reminds me of other games like Giants: Citizen Kabuto by just how big they are. Luckily, the Havoc suit is fast and nimble and it doesn't take long to get anywhere.If you want a solid, classic mecha shooter, then I don't see how you can do wrong with Gun Metal, especially since it usually goes on sale for about a dollar every now and then. I'd also suggest Battle Engine Aquila if you can find it.Pew Pew Bronze gets 16 ""Three animes butchered into making Robotech"" out of 12.About half of all Americans are on a diet on any given day.The curator:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation"

I have always been a firm believer that a game has to grab you within the first few minutes of gameplay to come to conclusion if you will continue playing. Same with girls choosing within 5 minutes if they will sleep with you. This game brings forth great awesomeness. It brings me back to the old school Afterburner Arcady games mixed in with over the top MECH Warrior action. The graphics are a bit meh, but it pays homage to so many games. I actually enjoy the fact that the developers paid more attention to gameplay than graphics. Love this game, the controllers are amazing, honestly better than most Triple A titles. The action is intest as well. Sorry this review is all over the place, I am far too excited for this game. Buy this game, do not hesitate, stop reading this crappy review and BUY THIS GAME.

If your a fan of old school Mech Anime or just love shooting stuff - this game is for you.Pros: Cheap price, fun gameplay and it has decent graphics/sound effects for a game within it's price range too.Drawback: no in-depth story but hey, this game is all about the gameplay anyways. Missions are kinda short but you get a new weapon after the first 5 or 6 so that is still not such a bad thing. $9.99 full price seems kind of expensive but once a sale hits it's well worth buying.In conclusion: IT'S FUN. I said that, right? Full price is a little much for what you get but it's $0.99 right now so why not pick it up? Such fun. It makes me feel like a kid again, pretending I was a Mech pilot and fighting for the people/land I hold dear with awesome weapons.

The controls are alright, the sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired but you can get around it. You're going ot want to play flying most of the time because it's much more fun. However it's safer as a humanoid mech and higher damage output actually on target. As a jet you have to get good at strafing accuratley. As a mech you can just shoot and don't take a lot of damage a lot of the time compared to flying (the wrong way round in my opinion but meh)7/10 good game for a bit of fun and flying around is ♥♥♥♥ as f**k"

Shooting durring gameplay is mouse though.Because it's an older game, it will run on almost any computer  and get a respectable framerate.My only complaint about this game is there's a bit of an aggressive difficulty curve, but you'll adapt (I mean, this is no Mafia 1 difficulty curve here)This may be the most underapreciated game on steam in my opinion.DEFINATELY 8/10"
