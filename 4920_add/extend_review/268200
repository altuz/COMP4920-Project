,Not Recommended,268200,10758573,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,Tripas,"While the game is cheap and can kind of fun at times, it inevitably gets dragged down by its major flaw: it gets boring pretty fast.See, this is a port of an iPad game that featured microtransactions. And, although they're no longer present in the PC port, you can still see their influence in the design of the game, because you either grind your way through the same missions over and over again just so you can afford the upgrades to beat the harder levels or... well, with no microtransactions at all there's not even an alternative, you either grind those upgrades or you're not going anywhere.So, if you want a good turn-based strategy game, try something else. Preferably something that was actually built as being an actual PC game."
,Recommended,268200,9194728,"Posted: 20 February, 2014",all,Pige0n,"NOTE: Review is complete now. Played through the game in its entirety. Additions are in italics.First things first, the price is right. Regardless of quality, you can seldom go wrong when you see a price like this. The art style of the game is fantastic. It's not something I'd expect from a game with a price tag this low.The second thing I noticed is the music. I spent some time sitting at the main menu eating my lunch before I got into playing, just listening to the music. Many people don't realize it, but music is a very important aspect to both film and games, and it helps set the mood. XCOM, for example. in the height of combat, features a pounding bassline. Depending on your preference, Antisquad one-ups it, opting for a full symphony orchestra, to accomplish the same thing and more.Third, the game sets you off with an optional tutorial, making it easy for players new to the genre to pickup the game and get playing. Many of the old games in the genre don't do much in the way of training, and instead require you to read through enormous manuals (think X-com UFO Defense and Jagged Alliance 2),Alright, first off, this game utlizes the Action Point system, like Jagged Alliance and X-Com: UFO Def, it does not use movement style of XCOM:EU/EW, which makes perfect sense, certain classes would be hilariously over/underpowered otherwise. Speaking of classes, there are eight characters to choose from, making up five different classes (the classes that double-up have unique abilities which make them different than the character who shares its class), and all of them have their place. Squad size is limited to three, as a result, different character combinations will all yield extremely different styles of play.As for general play itself, there is no hit/miss system, nor cover system. So when it comes to tactical elements, your options are to just skirt outside enemy sight range, and to kite the enemy. You have vision overentiremap, which allows you to set a plan of attack, and a plan is definitely needed. Enemies, as far as I can tell, have comparable stats, the only advantages you have are your unique character abilities, and the ability to revive your fallen allies. Needless to say, these advantages are absolutely critical to mission success, due to the fact that on the hardest difficulty, hell, you are hilariously outnumbered and outgunned.As for character progression, you earn gold with the completion of each mission and for each enemy you kill. (Be warned, if you fail a mission you may actually lose gold, so avoid biting off more than you can chew, and keep to the lower difficulties at first if you just want to progress through the game). With you gold you can upgrade your characters' weapons, armor, as well as individual stats, such as health, number of actions points, etc. It can also be used to purchase consumables such as health packs, temporary stat boosts, etc.ComplaintsOne of my minor complaints with the game thus far, is the inability to alter the control scheme in-game. The game currently offers a launcher in which you can adjust video quality, resolution, and your controls, but nothing the actual game has been launched.Another problem I have is that you can get gold by posting on twitter and facebook. The game doesn't go out of its way to shove twitter and facebook integration down your throat, it just mentions it casually, but I tend to dislike games that provide advantages by using social media. (Though I can't blame the developers wanting to get the word out about their game!)After progressing through the game, the quality of dialogue has deteriorated immensely. Some games I play for the story, others for the gameplay, some for both. This game falls more in the middle of those three categories, so it's not an end-all. The gametriesto have a story, and it's not too difficult to make sense of, it's just not put together very well in that regard, though it can very easily be fixed in later patches.Having beaten the game on ""Hell"" difficulty (the hardest difficulty), there needs to be an additional difficulty unlocked once you've beaten all missions on ""Hell"", it's just too easy once your squad is upgraded. Every single mission is effortless, with the exception ofone, Losing Control. That mission is absurdly difficult, even with afullyupgraded squad. If every mission were around that level of difficulty on the next difficulty setting, the game would be incredibly challenging.Lastly, there are bugs here and there, which is to expected in beta. I haven't encountered any bugs in actual gameplay, only in the menus, which is great, as it hasn't impeded my gameplay. The bug: skills and stats can be upgraded. Action points can be upgraded 8 times, +5 each time. I believe I was only able to upgrade it 7 times on one character, yet it yielded +10 on one upgrade, so technically the end result was the same, just getting there was just quicker.I have encountered another bug which does effect character stats: if you have a soldier with an upgraded weapon and/or armor, and they drop into a bleedout, upon revival they lose the stats from the items for the remainer of the mission (though this makes perfect sense and is fair were it intended).tl;drAll in all, it's a fun game, with lots of replayability. If you're even the slightest bit interested in the genre, you can't go wrong with picking this up, especially for the price. Hell, I've already spent 20 hours on the game, a 1:5 dollars spent:hours played ratio. I definitely got my moneys worth, even if I am mostly done playing the game until the next update."

But the game can be very long actually because if you want to finish it you need some good gear.To reach this, you need a lot of money and when i say a lot, i think a huge amount of monney. Only one way to get it, redo and redo again the same missions. Count like 10 times each (just a guess, from how much upgrades cost in shop and how much you gain from one mission)I cant see a cheapest way to make a game ""long"".Anyway i gave up after 4 hours of grinding on the same exact mission again and again. It wasnt fun.But if you think 5 euros is fair for a couple hours of original gameplay, you can try it."

The wave of crappy mobile ports on Steam needs to end.The misspells, poor dialogue etc. I can overlook.The gameplay itself is fine, enjoyable, but the obvious porting makes it a pain to play.Adapt UI for a desktop PC, zoom the game out a bit, remove (or shrink) ""Share"" buttons.

I really tried over and over to play this game, but there is no reason. All your guys are pretty much 2 hit kills, most of the characters are useless. The two scouts get killed almost instantly and since enemies almost always counterattack, they always get merced right away. The two snipers are immobile as well as the heavy guys. The two usefull characters, the main guy and the french sapper, are both boring to begin with, and it just makes gameplay slow, repetetive, and boring. Like I said, it has potential, fun soundtrack, fun characters (Except those two), could be fun gameplay. The problem is balance. There is none. Unless you wanna grind mission one 500 times to get enough gold to upgrade one characters one base stat. I am a pretty big fan of the turn base genre, and this game just isn't fun.

The price point is kinda scary, I immediately expected micro transactions and upcomming dlc spam when I saw it. However, the devs already said in the forum that neither will happen. No buying coins and no paid dlc. So the pricepoint actually makes the game a steal and it is way deeper than I expected from a ""phone game"". Combat is fun with lots of strategies, graphics are pretty good and more than enough for this type of game.

It's clunky with mouse and keyboard and I spent most of my time fighting with the interface rather than enemies. There's also a huge amount of interface lag. I play on a 144hz monitor and this game feels like I'm playing in a layer of glue. Scrolling is slow. Menus and options are terrible. The interface ""select"" or ""affirmative"" sound effect makes me want to punch someone in the face. It's that awful ""bubble pop"" sound effect that you hear when some tween on 'Pretty Little Liars' gets a text mesage. I guess that makes me think of gangsters with guns? Also, why do I have to click on enemies I've already killed to get the reward from them? With the same button that makes me move? Hire an interface and UI designer already.So far, this game is crappy to play on pc and probably on anything. Tooltips and mouseovers have been around for 10+ years. But since this game is designed for touch, how would it know where your mouse pointer is to overlay a tooltip? Who even knows!The good?It's not finished yet and my complaints are all fixable!Animations and graphics are passable.In-game sound effects are good.

Upgrades are too expensive, resources too hard to come by, enemy loadouts are vast.

But as you level up your characters the tactical options do open up and you can play each mission to suite you.I believe the mobile version of this game is a pay to win game. I can confirm that these version is not a pay to win game. There is an in game currency which is used to level up you characters. There are a lot of stats to upgrade and many types of health packs to buy for your individual characters. It can be a little bit of a grind at times to earn enough money to upgrade the stats of you characters. This is because you need to repeat the same few missions to earn enough money to upgrade. However the game is fun to play and there are many characters to choose from. Because of its repetitious nature I can play the missions only so many time before I do get bored. There is an addictive element to the game but even that runs out after a while.I do recommend this game. It is great value for money and fun to play.

I hope it will help with those making a decision to purchase.In Antisquad, you will be in-charge of a group of mercenaries who basically fight for good.  You will start with about 5 or 6 and you can add another 3-4 to the team via purchase.  The game is turn-based and attacks always hit, there is no random chance to hitting something with an attack.  It is your attacks, skills, and special attacks versus the enemies.   In that regard it plays a bit like chess or Stratego or a board game without random chance.  The most important thing is to choose you moves and actions carefully, in the right order, and to consider what the consequences are before hand.Gameplay itself is sort of a mix of chess and XCOM EU.  The setting is much like Jagged Alliance 2 or similar tactical strategy games.  There is banter between the characters.  Each character has unique skills and attacks, but are mostly of one class.  Classes include a scout, assault, demolitions, so on.  But each character within a class has some different special abilities.  Characters not only can upgrade their attacks and skill, but attributes,  personal weapon and outfit (armor) (which is  only useable by that character), and additional items that are useable by anyone such as medkits, stims, grenades, and armor power ups.The game advances through missions.  Each mission is part of a series of missions that make up a chapter, I suppose.  I'll have to check on their lingo a bit later.  I believe only some of the chapters are advancing the story, others may be selected as you wish.  To her experience and gold to purchase things, you can replay these missions over and over, at any difficulty you choose, once it is available.  Or just proceed to the next mission as you wish.The game was first made for tablets, is very colorful, the AI is good, the game is entertaining and makes you think.  But you finish each individual mission in a chapter at easy or normal difficulty, in about 15 mins to an hour.  However this is early in the game in the first three chapters at easy and normal.  It gets more involved later.  The point is that you don't have to plan a whole evening around playing it.The game on the pc is user friendly.  While on the Title screen tips will come up, you can click on these pop-up boxes daily and receive some gold, a nice touch.  You can equip items in your personal backpack of each character depending on the outfits pockets, you can even have them airdrop some items from the store during a mission but for extra cost.  There does seem to be a character with a personal item that if purchased reduces these airdrop costs also.  Fantastic!The key concepts to remember for newer players are:1) All attacks and skills hit.  2) If you kill it during the action, the enemy cannot counter-attack  3)Read the help and learn from the tutorials and tips.  It is all accessible in-game as you play.  3) There is an icon that explains if someone can counter-attack or not.  See the help etc   4) The mission will have drops that can benefit you, both placed and as enemies die.  5) Learning when a unit can counter-attack or not is important in the game.  You need to have enough enery, enough range, a trait, or a power-up or other bonus that overrides the lack of stamina or action points.The game is well polished, looks great, runs on an Intel HD 2500 gpu smoothly.  It runs on Win7-64 bit no issues.  I recommend the game as long as you don't see it as a fully fleshed out Fallout, XCOM, or Jagged Alliance type game.  It is more like Chess meets XCOM-EU missions.   It's like Stratego or a bit like Sid Meier's Ace Patrol, it's not a simulation or full RPG like Arma or Jane's Fighters would be in comparison to those.I think that will do for now as a review."

So, I was going in as a noob, with only a basic grasp of the gameplay style.  Unlike some other early access titles I'm sampling, this one requires little to no previous experience.  So you can pick this up, click play, and you're ready to go!The GUI is very very user friendly as well, it reminds me of a facebook game's UI.  Don't let that phrase scare you, that would be the only common ground between this and a facebook game.  From the buttons, to the icons, to the fonts, and HUD.  The GUI adds to the experience.  I only mention this, because strategy games can get a little cumbersome with the UI.Gameplay is really really smooth, the animations are fluid, and the mobs are very well drawn.  It ranks high in all of these points, so much so that I am surprised this is being called early access.  If you're hunting for bugs, I doubt you'll find many.  After 9 hours of play/test time, I've run into none.Gameplay itself is pretty standard for a RPG theme.  (I know this is strategy, but I don't have as much experience there!) From your clothing (all one piece) to weapons (restricted to character types) it has some moderate perks/upgrades.  All of which are based on in game currency, which you get from a plethora of tasks.  You can share your progress on Twitter or Facebook to earn coins, or just kill the baddies.  You also recieve a hefty ransom on completion of levels, and as a random win from ""crates"".  (These also drop from mobs, though more rare than moola.)So far, replayablity is high.  Each level has 3 (4 if you count easy) difficulty levels, which doesn't just ""up"" mobs, it switches them out for more mobs, or takes the ""upping"" route.Overall personal rating would be 8/10.  If they add more levels, characters, and upgrade/perks it will bump it up to a 9 (then 10 if they add all 3!)"

It does offer some unique features and graphics but it is still very similar to games like Xcomm.Not alot of units, but each comes with a nice set of skills. I would say that this game is simple, however... amidst all that simplicity lays a challenging game, with space for different playstyles, customization and tough decisions.Definetly recommen this game for tactical strat lovers. However... i would suggest playing Xcomm first before trying this 1 for those who are new to the genre."

Oh, and NOTHING is Pay 2 Win in this game, believe me when I say this, NOTHING is Pay 2 Win, everything requires you to ghet duh gold to upgrade/unlock your characters, and it is pretty fun too. You might think; ""This game is $3.99, screw this and it looks like a piece of crap with poor graphics based on the images I look at."" Well, you probably have like $20/$50 to spare in your account, or just enough (I sold a Spec Killstreak Pomson 6000 from tf2 in the market for $4 to ghet this game btw), so buy this and see for yourself.

It's lighthearted but the challenge is definitely there. I got my team wiped on 'normal' difficulty because I'm terribad so I'm sure veteran strategy players will get their fill on the 'hard' or 'hell' difficulties.You have different characters with different abilities. You can upgrade them, adjust their loadouts...just about anything you could want from a turn-based combat game.Most of all this game is FUN and at the current price its an absolute steal. I really hope the developers get the sales deserve."

The look is fantastic, the use of color is beautiful, and the humor is amusing. The combat system takes a little bit getting used to and can at times seem a bit unforgiving, especially if your used to turn based team combat games such as Xcom, and Wasteland. Lets face it in some of those games your guys can take a hailstorm of bullets before they drop. Not so much in Antisquad, at least at the beginning, once you have made some money you can upgrade your team members to withstand more damage. So if your starting out and either getting shot down, or are just barely making it through, don't fret, your guys will get stronger pretty quickly if you spend your money right.Also I was only compairing Antisquad to Wasteland and Xcom as they are all turn based strategy games, but really the simularies all end there. I could pick it all apart and say where Antisquad excells and where it fell short, but that would serve no real purpose. If your reading this, your wondering if this game is right for you. A few simple questions will answer that for you.1) Do you enjoy turn based strategy games? (If yes, then this is a good match for you)2) Do you prefer your games to have a sense of humor to them or do you prefer them to be more serious? (If you like a bit of humor then this game is a good match for you.)3) Do you want your games to have good soild graphics, or do you think the graphics don't matter as much in a strategy title? (If you like graphics and want your games to ""look good"" then this game is a good match for you.)"

It may be great for some people but it is not at all the kind of ""strategy"" game I enjoy.  No ""cover"" to speak of but it does have a sort of overwatch system.  Sight lines are way too short, weapon ranges are unrealistic, smoke bomb makes you immune to being shot instead of giving you concealment only, delivery of ""items"" for ""coins"" in mid-battle (such as an energy drink that instantly makes running HUGE distances easy) is - well it's silly.
