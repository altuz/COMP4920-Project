It did not disappoint.Its essentially a twin stick shooter. With an extremely addictive gameplay loop. Unfortunately the reasons it becomes addictive is that its set up almost exactly like a free to play game. The good aspect of this once you buy it, no more actual money is needed to play. There are multiple resources in order to level your character, weapons and gear up.There are coins, chips and skill points as well as other requirements to unlock new gear which will allow for different styles of play. However mostly its a mixture of fast moving character builds or tank builds or some concoction of assorted gear designed to min/max coin drops or XP gain. There is even some gear that requires the renowned 'prestige' mode to unlock. Another aspect of the free to play model breaking through is that enemies occasionally drop mystery boxes which are opened individually at the end of a mission and yes, some of them are empty.Another aspect I rather enjoy is that there is drop in drop out co-op up to 4 players and the more players there are an instance or mission, stronger and more enemies are spawned with more XP to be gained for all. It borrows from Diablo in the way the loot on screen is only grabbable by yourself. So there is no fighting over coin and chip drops.If your looking for something mildly mindless but enjoyable and like games 'where the numbers go up' this is sure to deliver.Follow my curation for more"

,Recommended,268220,19288923,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,Wildt,"Meltdown is a really solid indie RPG twin stick shooter in a futuristic setting devoid of any story.Some of the main features are VR support (the reason behind my purchase), 4 player co-op, and semi-randomly generated levels.There are 3 resource types: XP which unlocks skills in a 3-branch tree,  money and upgrade chips (weapon/equipment purchases/upgrades).You can only carry 2 firearms and 1 melee weapon.The gameplay is solid, and the controls are tight using an x360 controller.I quite enjoyed the energetic music as well - fits the game well.There is generally really nothing wrong with this game, but there is absolutely nothing new under the sun either. And there is too little visual variation in the maps. Some more enemy types, attack/movement options might prevent the 30 ""campaign"" levels from feeling as repetetive as they did.The VR support for Oculus rift (DK2) is really solid, with large easily readable menu texts, and while it doesn't really immerse you (or attempts to), it definately heightens the sense of involvement and intensity. Only complaint is the zoom effect when someone levels up - it's too much in VR.If you're just looking for a non-VR twinstick shooter, try the Halo Spartan Assault/Strike games instead which are similarly priced. But if RPG or VR ticks your boxes, then this is a no-brainer at the price.73%"

Actually it's set on a space station that seems to have gone mad and is intent on ending your life by sending all of it's robots after you. Using an isometric perspective the game seems to give a nod to gaming of yesteryear.You will have to fight wave after wave of them, but you can bring some friends along with you as the game has a neat multiplayer mode. You can play online of locally if you prefer, but the more players you have the tougher the enemies become. There are plenty of objects to hide behind making the game a sort of cover based shooter. Every few levels feature a boss which makes for some great multiplayer action, but can seem a little daunting when you're on your own.If there's one small complaint it is that most of it looks the same, but this doesn't really matter when you're busy blasting the hell out of those metal nut cases."

Upgrades are simple and dont require a lot of tough decisions.The bad: You can get stuck on a level without having any 1ups left (this allows you to continue where you died without restarting the whole level). And Ive been stuck on the same level since the day I bought this months ago. I cant even go back and beat other levels to try and earn more spec points for upgrades. For some reason I cant make it through the levels I already beat with only one life. So Im totally stuck. Had I known I could get stuck I wouldve not wasted these precious 1-ups on earlier levels. I thought they were more abundant.

That I was so excited I knew I could confidentally offer a very favorable review for Meltdown!First & Foremost - The game is ready for Xbox 360 Game Pads out of the box but the developers thought waaaay ahead of most others as they also allow you to map your game pad in options. Logitechs set to X-Input still can not switch the trigger buttons over to Digital from Analogue but with the option to map it totally circumvented those frustrations us Logitech fans have had with a portion of past releases.Secondly - Meltdown is a highly focused and minimalist approach to Run & Gun\Wave Attack\Schmups. Unlockable modes? Check! Unlockable weapons and skills? Check! You can even opt between three different soldier specialities which determine which skills are available in your skill tree.Thirdly - Polish. The game looks finished already! 'nuff said.And Finally - More to come. Before choosing mission (both static or randomly generated) I could easily option for online co-op with the press of the ""Y"" button and 33 players were online playing already at the time of this writing.

Some interesting upgrades, and not very difficult to obtain.Character movement is nicely fluid, however I feel that bullets don't go strictly where you aim which was really annoying at the start, once you get used to it it's not that big of a deal tho.The difficulty of the gameplay increased rather rapidly like on mobile games that are ""free"" when they want you to purchase virtual currency to proceed.. That gameplay mechanic is quite obvious when you die, if you have obtained 1up's you can use them when you die in a level to proceed, otherwise you have to restart the level, losing progress & things you have obtained during the level.This type of gameplay mechanic is frequently used in mobile games with micro-transactions.

Surprisingly good for a mobile port to the PC, the gameplay is good for what it is and the graphics are stylized and work well.Combat appears simple, though it requires thought and strategy. Sometimes taking cover and shooting works well, other times running and gunning (with rolling and dodging) is best. It all depends on what's shooting or throwing grenades at you, or self destructs (scary). Different weapons (and armor) for different situations, which are unlocked for purchase by meeting various criteria. You can carry up to two weapons at once and switch on the fly. Various upgrades are also available for purchase once sufficient funds and upgrade chips are collected.Upgrade your skills as you level up. There are three branches: Specialist, Soldier and Medic. Each one has features and bonuses appropriate for it's type. Choose which ones you want first to fit your play style or adapt it as you see fit (you get all of them eventually). Skills can be reset for the right price. Weapon upgrades can also be reset, you get nine points to allocate amongst two sequential branches and are a bit more limited. With weapons, resetting is free (at the time of this writing).Mystery boxes (bonus items) which appear to be randomly dropped as loot, contain assorted items such as Extra Credits, Extra Experience, Upgrade Chips, One Ups (extra lives/continues) and the dreaded...Nothing! These boxes are opened after level completion, if you survive. Add in looted powerups such as Double Damage (a brief damage spree) and Nuke 'Em (damages all nearby enemies on pick-up) for extra fun and mayhem. Replay levels to improve your rating (up to three stars). Steam achievements (collect 'em all) and trading cards included.__Notes: This review is based on the reviewer's single player experience (finished level 30 in a bit over 10 hours).

I love it, my friend Twitchy loves it and he's the one that told me to get the game so.. Thanks to him!The game takes place on a sci-fi setting, where the systems have been hijacked and all the robots are now going mad and are now evil. You have to blast through 30 stages with big bosses upgrading and buying new weapons along your journey to maintain peace. It has up to 4 player co-op and an arena mode at level 30!

A rare gem that has full controller support, shared-screen co-op, as well as online co-op that's balanced on its own, and is different enough from the regular game mode to make it worth the play through, not just ""oh here's the same game but with two people now."" Good fast-paced arcade-y action that's a lot of fun to play.The game mechanics are pretty easy to pick up, it's challenging enough to keep you frustrated at times but with strategy and upgrades you work out the best strategy to beat every type of enemy. That's probably the game's strongest part, that almost every enemy (or combination of enemies) no matter how weak it might seem, has the ability to ♥♥♥♥ up your day. What might seem like a nuisance at the start of the game becomes a swarm of holy♥♥♥♥♥♥by level 30. The game devs have definitely done their jobs doing playthroughs and testing to make sure it's got a good balance between easy-enough-to-not♥♥♥♥♥♥you-off and hard-enough-to-make-beating-a-boss-feel-rewarding.Levels are great, there are random props and mood that sets the backdrop and gives a decent immersion. Randomly-generated keeps it pretty new every time, and each third of the game has a slightly different style which is nice and keeps things fresh. The music is also fantastic, plenty of dubs and wubs that match the sci-fi action feel of the game, and was an awesome way to pump you up while playing. Cycles through different sets of tracks for different levels, great addition to play.The only thing keeping this game from being ""THE BEST EVER"" is a larger story that kind of ties the game together...there's a bit of lip-service to the robots on a space station malfunctioning and you having to clear them out, blah blah blah...it's all the game *needs* but to make it a best-of contender it would be cool to know more about Zed.

If you want a game with fast paced action and a wide variety of things to do, Meltdown is the game for you. The game itself is fairly new so it only has a campaign mode, which you can play online. The game is definitely already a work of art, and still has so much potential. If the developers could add a sandbox mode, where players could build their own maps, that could lead to PVP multiplayer. The game can already generate random maps, but those are only like the ones we have. With the addition of sandbox, developers could add different types of terrain, different elevations, and even vehicles. Vehicles like tanks and military jeeps could maybe seat about 3 people, but I'm getting off topic. The game so far has not had any bugs (to my experience), and runs really smoothly. So, if you are thinking of buying this game, what are you waiting for? The graphics are amazing, the gameplay's great, the multiplayer's great, and the price is low. Amazing game!"

The gameplay is tight, the co-op is a blast, and the AI is surprisingly good. I actually really enjoy everything this game does. My ONLY complaint, and I mean only, is that the 1up's system is a little annoying because you have limited checkpoints. Other than that, this game is a must buy if you enjoyed Bastion or any other arcade type game with slick mechanics. The control system is surprisingly good on keyboard, considering I only liked to play Bastion with a gamepad. I still play this with a gamepad, but both systems work well.Anyways, BUY THIS GAME!

Enemies just randomly spawn in front of you, so you have no time to plan an approach. Only two weapons and basically nothing else to do. No grenades, no powers, no flanking, no combos, no strategy, no nothing. Most shots don't really hit multiple enemies, exploding enemies don't damage each other, etc... so positioning is of very little importance. Just avoid their damage zones and shoot. Cover is not 'tactical' enough, it's mostly a gimmick. Ironically enough, you will find more 'tactical' gameplay in the hardcore action twinstick competitors this tries to differentiate itself from.- Too slow paced to be an action twin stick shooter. 2-3 enemies on screen at a time is just boring for an action game.- EXTREMELY repetitive levels. Basically all the maps are linear and predesigned with the same 10 or so areas (that are made with some generic assets to begin with). No PCG maps and no variety in level design.- Bad design in general, like inconsistent pacing (most of the game is boring while bosses are extremely hard), game breaking (life regen) or useless upgrades, you simply run out of ammo during boss battles because see point below. Enemies can stunlock you at full health and you die without any chance of retaliation- Bosses are just regular enemies with more HP.The ugly:- The unlock system is designed as a F2P game for mobile and is a chore as expected. While there are no paid microtransactions here, the difficulty ramps up horribly, forcing you to grind earlier levels so you can get good enough gear for later levels. But hey, levels are all the same anyway, so you probably can't even tell the difference between level 5 and level 10. Oh, and after you unlock stuff in single player/online, have fun doing basically the same thing AGAIN for local coop. Having fun yet?So maybe after a 10 hour grind you could have enough variety in this game for it to actually be entertaining for once, but by then you'd have uninstalled it."

The soundtrack is fairly good but can grind a little after a few hours it does change a little through the levels. If you love grinding for armour / guns etc this game will really appeal to you and whilst the enemies aren't easy to defeat they never feel extremely overpowered.The gameplay is excellent in fact more expensive titles have a lot to learn from this game, It's extremely smooth and responsive.

This topdown twinstick shooter is a lot of fun, and the VR support in the Oculus Rift is exemplary. I'd even go as far as saying the melee kill cams really aren't so jarring - the only problem I'd have with them is just prior to the mele kill scene, the cut makes me think I just died or did something I wasn't supposed to. After a while this subsides as you get used to the cut.At my first attempt I thought I had encountered a UI bug but go figure, it was just my mouse button that was giving out. :-DAll in all a satisfying purchase.PS: A lot of folks report a center-drift issue with the game. Rather the problem is it's resetting the tracker at each secene load. Word of advice, when you finish a level and click to go to the next, or click to start your game, don't steer your head until the next scene has actually loaded.

I mean, what is the point of upgrading your weapons and completing missions just to have it all reset when you prestige? I can understand resetting the skill tree (that's the point of prestige), but this is just blatant padding. Besides, what do you get from prestige? A whopping +5 health and +5 shield and the ability to upgrade your weapons one level higher! Oh, and a golden nickname of course, because everybody wants to be special!And you have to do it three effing times, btw.Enemies. They lack in variety and some of them are just a pain in the аss, like the bot that will chase you down and if you ever stop mashing the spacebar or run into something, you get immobilized, and then the other bots come and rip you into shreds.Game mechanics. I get that only humans can trigger the mines, but why explosions don't affect the bots? Your grenade launcher damages them and the mines don't. Also the bot that throws literally the same grenades at you and nobody takes damage (except you, that is).Oh, and about mashing the spacebar. If you don't care about drops, you can complete some of the levels just by infinitely dodging the enemies straight to the end.Overall, don't bother buying it if you don't have a group of friends that can play with you and contain your frustration."

Its boring, levels are all the same.Playability is low - plenty of bad designed concepts, like weird upgrade system, useless items, bad aiming mechanics (aiming on the ground where enemy stands), weird auto-guarding mechanics (why not a key to duck?). Melee kills are taking too long time making a hero kill plenty of times like being hit by rocket or body blocked by exploding+stunning enemy: 2 of them is certain death no matter how high level your hero is.Graphics and music are cool, but at the same time it gives you misleading feeling that the game gonna be cool, full of action and shooting - its not.The idea of oblique floor annoys you very quickly as it takes 2 keys instead of 1 to walk straight + you will be pressing ""roll"" key all the time to avoid being hit and just to move faster - btw. you can just roll the whole level ignoring all enemies up to final-battle. The final-battle itself is annoyingly hard compared to rest of the level - you are locked in small space being attacked by spawning all the time enemies.Double Damage boost lasts only few seconds - being dropped by last killed enemy its almost over when you meet another on your way.In addition UI is badly designed, using menu and scrolling with a mouse is a pain - why keyboard is disabled for anvigation?No info on future Upgrades (until you reach them) is making you guess what direction you are leveling up your hero/weapons.Bottom line: audio and graphics are cool, but playability is low."

A Bastion clone it is not.While there are a variety of enemies and guns, I felt the core gameplay to be fickle and problematic:1) The aiming does not feel precise.  Often times you will end up shooting next to a foe when you are clicking right on them - use of a controller makes this actually even worse.  The game is meant to be played with auto-aim and this often takes the satisfaction out of a game like this.2) The biggest problem in the game is that it feels like you are fighting the controls.  You are locked into an animation once you start it which is significantly more cumbersome than it is challenging.  For example, you cannot go from melee to shooting or rolling to anything in a reasonable time frame -- you will have to wait for your character to finish said action, delay and then start your new action.3) The game relies on grind rather than content.  Making an area too difficult to complete so you have to re-do previous areas is not a good stand in for content -- it just shows you purposely undertune the starting options.  What necessarily comes with this is an inverse difficulty curve - easy at the end and hard at the outset.The core issue comes down to gameplay.  At its heart the game feels unresponsive and slow -- you will not die because you couldn't react in time, but because the game locks you into animation lag. And this is coming from a Monster Hunter veteran, I am no stranger to animation lag and meaningful gameplay."

,Recommended,268220,14445984,"Posted: 13 February, 2015",all,Digitalhead,"This is a nice compromise for me with most of the features I would want in a game like this. It has genuinely fun gameplay, nice graphics, and even basic multiplayer.Where it wins:The short missions make it perfect when I'm just killing some time. I can pick a mission based on anticipated time to complete if I have something I need to do soon. It's also nice to see that the Steam version is a complete game, unlike the mobile version. The gamepad setup is nice, and the aim assist makes it easy to work with. Multiplayer is fun to play as well. Well worth the $1.74 I paid when it was on sale.Where it fails:It is made for mobile and there are some nonfunctional remnants left over from that, namely the leaderboard buttons. The multiplayer doesn't let a set or group of players to follow eachother through missions. It also said that if you are having trouble on a level, play multiplayer to make it easier, but when additional players are in a mission, there are more bots that can take much more damage, making it more than twice as difficult, so it more than negates the concept of getting help. The aim assist, while being handy, can also hinder your play. It automatically targets things for you. When there are power nodes, it's difficult to get back on target with bots, or the bots you actually want to target.Overall, it's worth playing, if you catch it while it's on sale, but I sure hope the devs are planning on making some improvements, especially with the aim assist, multiplayer, and benifits of being Prestige 3 Level 55. I'd also kind of like to see a good way to reset the data to restart from scratch."

The mechanics are pretty usual, of which you can shoot, melee, run, and cover under a things. There are two things that make me like this game at the first time I played it:The tree development is massive! Your character has three skill trees. Additionally, each of your character's weapon also has two skill trees. The good thing (at least for me) is that you can edit/respec your skill easily with a cost of some of your money (similar to Borderlands).I was not expecting any good multiplayer experience within this game. It turned our that the multiplayer is so responsive! I played this game, started at the beginning of a level, and then some people started to join my game. It was so fun to do mission together with other people!Definetely a hidden gem! I am not sure whether I would buy this game if there was no discount, although I think it is worth to get this game at its full price."

My first impression of this game was that it was a dual-stick shooter full of microtransaction incentivising you to buy better gear to be less pathetic. I later came to realise there isn't any kind of paid transaction and that this game was simply a grind-fest.Meltdown is a fun shooter where you go down a randomly generated level and fill robots of different shapes and sizes into smoldering piles of medal. You do this with a selection of weapons that don't win points for originality but are adequate while protecting yourself with different armor pieces and upgrades. It also incorparates quick and easy multiplayer making company welcome and later in the game, kind of nessacary (coming from a guy who deliberitly avoids online interactions). The music is like a mild wubfest, not my cup of tea, but it 's as easy as turning of music and playing some 2SFH in it's place.After about an hour and a half I was able to ""prestige"" reseting all my stuff while letting me unlock more armor (you still have to pay for) and upgrading weapons one more level than they could previously. ""Cool,"" I thought but you reset EVERYTHING, including your weapon upgrades and expensive armor pieces. You keep you're money but nothing else, it was then I realised I wasn't the badass in thugged out armor and weapons assisting weak characters, I was the sucker wasting his time and money until he prestiged for the first time, unknowlingy shooting himself in the foot. Unless you don't want the locked armors, you have to grind, and grind, and grind. Then you still have to grind for the money to afford the items and having to have enough chips to upgrade selected items. You also can't get the good weapons until you FULLY upgrade the subpar ones and if you are going to prestige you're going to be stuck as an armorless, smg-toting weakling for a few hours, adding to the difficulty. I IMPLORE YOU, IF YOU GET MELTDOWN, IF YOU READ THIS, SAVE YOUR GOLD SHOULD YOU WANT THE GEWD STUFF, DON'T ADD ANYMORE TO THE GRIND THAN THERE ALREADY IS. IF YOU DO AT LEAST GET TO LVL 3 PRESTIGE THE JUMP OUT THE NEAREST WINDOW.But I digress, if you don't mind a bit of a grind, it is a fun distraction. I got it on sale but I think it's cheap regardless."

Developing you character is well implemented, game is well balanced. Only minus is lack of variety of boards- I can live with that, but still I would be very thankful if developers add some new boards with more diversity. Game is addictive, convenient to play and compared to other Oculus games I think ratio of price and entertainment is very good. Highly recommended for Oculus owners."
