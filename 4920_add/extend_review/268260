,Not Recommended,268260,9090606,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Zoé,"[Edit] I bought this game on release back in mid February, since then there was one update, I didn't notice if it even did anything.  Back in February people asked when more songs would be added, and they mentioned upcoming DLC packs, which have never come out.  So if you're a cautious buyer assume the game has been abandoned for better prospects. It's currently on sale for $7.50, maybe not a bad price for an hour of entertainment for you. That said, none of my complaints have been touched and the game never really received any real update.  End edit.I will preface this by saying, I enjoy the game, I sing, and I'm well versed in the genre in my opinion.Unfortunately this game is fairly questionable.  The pitch detection tends to be all over the place as it's picked up my non-vocalised coughing as a part of a song. On top of that the intros, and subsequently exits, for a lot of the lyrics could be greatly improved, in a lot of songs it can be from .2 to .5 seconds ahead where the actual music is.  There is a distinct lack of quality here in comparison to console karaoke games like SingStar.Minor complaints:-A handful of songs have non-sung parts that you still have to speak.-The song menu has questionable UI, you have to click every song and you can't scroll or use arrow keys by default.-Playing random songs in the pause menu is rather distracting and annoying, you tend to pause for a reason and putting a completely different song in someones head is not a good idea in a karoake game.-The track list has a lot of good, but many terrible songs to sing, this is not a judgement of whether the song is good or bad but whether the song is good or bad to sing.  If the track list were, lets say, 100 songs this would be less of a problem, but the track list length isn't one of my complaints.Overall I'd give it a 5/10, completely enjoyable but definitely not good, with it's glaring flaws, minor annoyances, and the fact things like Karaokeparty already exist online for the pc and things like singstar exist on consoles.  This is just a weak entry to the genre of karaoke games, and while it may be the 'PC's first' it's probably going to be end up being known as the PC's worst."

,Not Recommended,268260,9211798,"Posted: 21 February, 2014",all,JaffaCaffa,"It's not terrible, but it's definitely not great either. Unfortunately with a lot of the songs it's a second delayed so you have to either sing before the words pop up on the screen or just extend the words to make sure you get the bar filled in time (ie: ""have a good timeeeeeee..come on"". This makes it much more difficult for songs you don't know the words to already, because you're guessing ahead to a beat/song you have no clue how it goes, therefore automatically getting punished. The pitches also seem to be off with some songs, where the singer clearly goes higher yet the game says it doesn't. I've found I have a difficult time with low-pitched songs, it always says I'm off? Even if it's a talking bit and I talk with it. Yet if I sing in a high-pitched voice it's perfectly fine. I am a girl who was always a soprano in choir so it's not a huge problem, but I'm not sure how well it would work with guys/people with deeper voices so just a warning!TLDR: If you like singing and have the extra money to splurge go ahead and buy it, otherwise I honestly wouldn't waste the money (especially if it's not on sale)."

,Recommended,268260,9094108,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Nefarious Neck Romancer Neo,"So welcome to what I know as the first Karaoke type game on Steam.  Wonderfully enough, it's better than a good amount of games that had singing thrown in, I'm looking at you Guitar Hero franchise, yes, hang your head in shame.Where it is no Rockband it's enough to tie you over if you don't have it.  There is quite a selection of songs to fit the pop menu with some old, some new, and just guilty pleasures.  You can have two people sing at once, which I have not tried out yet but my headset seems to pick up sounds just fine.  I don't think you'll be investing in a fancy USB mic for this one.The negatives aren't -that- bad.  The pitch detection is a little wonky and can leave you a bit frustrated at times.  The lyrics seemed to go by too fast.  The interface is frustrating too.  Keyboard selecting is not an option so you have to fumble around with the mouse, trying to select songs that seem like they are trying to escape you.  No really, they try to deselect themselves if you aren't EXACTLY hovering in the middle.It also wants you to upload your face, your singing face, to facebook.  So you, too, can look as confused as I do when I sing.In the end, it's a singing game, it let's you sing.  Have fun with it."

Now with all games when first released, there wil be some bugs that need to be fixed. That's understandable. So I don't mind if the game crashes once every other time we play with it. ME and my friends still enjoy singing through the songs. Some may claim it is too easy, but I think thats what you need with a game like this. So it can include everyone in the family, even the tone deaf ones.With 40 songs to choose from and promise of DLC packs in the future. I think this is a great game for the price you are paying for. :)"

But as much as I enhoyed the ten songs I know for what I paid I expected more songs.. And some of the bars didnt match what they were singing and pretty sure I saw a couple of typo's in the wording too.. Overall its fun for a laugh not worth what I paid tho.

,Recommended,268260,9084686,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Cpt. Rico Chet,"This game is in the same vain as just about every other karaoke game out there. It's very similar to Sing Star, and it's much more forgiving than Rock Band is. I used to be one of the top Rock Band ""vocalist"" back during the height of the rhythm game genre. I found the game fun for what it is, and there are a good selection of songs for just about everyone. I would really recommend this for someone that enjoys singing, and if you were into the games mentioned previously."
,Recommended,268260,11268968,"Posted: 16 July, 2014",all,Alex.,"It's alright, same as the karaoke games on the consoles, for the price it's lacking quantity of songs.  I can see them trying to sell DLCs to milk us for money. Do i recommend this game? Yes and no, It's always fun to play with friends and family but like I said for 20$ you can get the basically the same game with 100+ songs on ps3. If they decide to release more songs through DLC for free it'll be TOTALLY worth it. Also It would be neat if they could have a webcam to play with other friends on steam that has this game so you can see eachother's silly faces while singing."
,Recommended,268260,9087006,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Ms Serious Business,"After doing about 5 or so songs, I'm beginning to see how out of sync some of the tracks are. For example, I had the Spin Doctor's Two Princes is completely unsynced by an entire line of lyrics.  However, I tried closing and restarting the song, and it was almost synced that time around.Most of the song bars are one word ahead of the actual song, so you need to start singing ahead of the singers in the videos, which can get distracting.  The main song navigation screen is a mouse scroll. It would be nicer if you could use your keyboard to tab through as well.For 15 bucks, I think the price is reasonable. I don't know if I would be so satisfied if I paid full price for it. Looking forward to seeing if they patch this up or not.It is still fun if you like karaoke games. It doesn't really matter if you sing the lyrics. It seems like I could just say, ""Ahhhhhhhhhh"" the whole time, and it seems to mark it as correct anyway.Now if I can somehow convince one of my friends to get this game too to sing with me..."

There is quite a diverse list of tracks to choose from all of them are great classics and catchy pop tunes. when you start a song it seems to be pretty fast for the actually singing of the song but you get used to the speed after a while. As for multiplayer, so far it is only local multiplayer for those who have 2 mic's at home, i convinced my friend to get this so that we could vs each other online but it doesnt work that way, i hope they add online competitive singing or duets. Is the game fun, Yes. it is a great party game and i enjoyed having a laugh with my friends as we sang Born this way by Lady Gaga. I hope they add in more song and online multiplayer to the game in the near future.I rate Let's Sing 7.5/10"

There are some songs in this game that I personally feel should just be listend to. However, this game needs some tweaking.The flaws with this game... the audio is slower than the transition bar... so in order to hit the bars on spot, you have to sing a bit ahead of the audio, which makes it a bit complicated since naturally, you try to sing with the music - not ahead of it. I had this problem with 'Don't Cha' by the ♥♥♥♥♥cat Dolls and 'Just Dance' by Lady Gaga.I'm not sure if it's my computer but if I enable the webcam, the audio and video become all jacked up.

Game will crashThe program doesn't handle some audio interfaces. As a result, it terminates as it's launched, generating a crash report.In my case, it's not happy with my Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 Pro USB.You can avoid it by disabling/unplugging the hardware that's causing the crash. But hmm, I don't have any other mic input on my PC.2. Can't choose the song to playI decide to unplug my poor SB and use a mic on my webcam. The program runs. The indicator in Option tells me my mic is working. But once I choose Play and the song list appears, a message will pop up telling me to connect a mic. And that pop up blocks me from choosing a song.3. Doesn't display device names that have non-alphabetic charactersUnconvinced but having no choice, I go back to Option and try to choose another mic. The menu shows me a list of mics on my PC but two of three have unrecognizable name like ""{0123adfada, 123123}"". So, which one is which?Let me add that no matter which mic I choose, I can't get to choose my first song.The bright side to me is that the developers seem to be working on problems their game has.I hope to be able to sing songs in this game and give it a more accurate, positive review."

This game is more like a sing along than a real karaoke game/system; on top of that the songs collection are limited.The scoring system and the pitch identification are basically BS. Basically, you will still get some scores and possible correct pitch as long as there are noise going through your microphone (yes, even though you are just talking or humming or just totally out of tune).As mentioned earlier, this is a sing along. What I am trying to say is that, basically you are just going to sing along with the artist of your selected song choice. They are not muted for you to sing.Does this worth even $5? I would have to say no. Is possible that you will feel more enjoyable singing along the radio or your mp3 players than this."
