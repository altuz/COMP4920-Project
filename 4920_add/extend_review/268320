Your goal is to reach the end portal in each level. You are moving, jumping and grappling from platform to platform. With each higher level the difficulty level is rising.Pros:+ you are a sticky blob (stuck to every object)+ great physic engine+ awesome level design+ lot of levels (90)+ 3 game modes (speed run, normal run, time trail)+ no glitches, no bugs+ checkpoints+ unlimited lives(+ achievements)Cons:- no level editor (no steam workshop)- music is not bad, but has less variety and it could be much more intenseRecommended, even if it'snot on sale, because there are a lot of levels and it has a really good designed physic engine.9/10"

,Recommended,268320,19954752,"Posted: 26 December, 2015",all,squiddingme,"As someone who loves games that use their basic movement systems as their core mechanic--games like Dustforce, Mirror's Edge etc; this is one of my favorite releases of 2015. Grapple is one of my dream games finally realized.The basic mechanics are simple: you are a blob that can attach to the side and underside of platforms, jump, and fire a small string of yourself onto solid objects to grapple and swing past areas where there is no ground to land on. Further mechanics are introduced in the levels themselves, such as red death platforms, ungrapple-able forcefield platforms, white bouncy platforms and pink cannons.The quality of the levels rollercoasters up and down--some levels make use of brilliant ideas and flesh out the basic mechanics of the game in fresh and clever ways, while others come off as lazy free-form collections of platforms. There are several weak levels and gimmick mechanics--for example, the invisible platform gimmick (platforms that only become visible when you are close enough), which is not at all interesting or fun and results in three of the worst ""maze"" levels in the game. Later levels fall into the trap of an over-reliance on precision momentum slinging, using long falls, bouncy platforms and cannons. This comes to a head with a level that requires slinging with extreme precision into another cannon, which can require many attempts.There is plenty to do: collectibles are used to guide the player through the ""intended"" path of each level and give reasons to return to levels for 100% optimal completion. A time trial mode challenges players to beat individual levels under a predefined par time (which is a useful gauge of performance, since there is no online leaderboard for the game). There is also a speedrun mode that challenges players to beat the game in 1 hour and 20 minutes.As with all games, there are a few quibbles here and there that you should be aware of:Movement is oriented to the direction of the camera; this can make adjusting to the side and underside of platforms somewhat awkward. It is something to get used to, but could ideally have been done better.You cannot seem to remap the controls. Thankfully, the default controls are nothing out of the ordinary, but if you're an old guy and use ESDF or something, you're out of luck here.The music is average to mediocre, full of aggressive synths, and can grate after a few hours of play. I found myself eventually turning the music off and listening to the Dustforce soundtrack instead.The game seems to have no community to speak of, and the developers do not seem to have reached out to the players much at all. I believe this game could have received more recognition with a more active development team, online leaderboards (which I think would be the most valuable addition for garnering a community), and a level editor to extend the longevity of the game; as it stands Grapple basically hasn't been touched since its March launch."

Regular checkpoints throughout the MASSIVE amount of levels make it very forgiving - controls are easy to pick up and feel very fluid.You need to go fast, slow, look around, take leaps of faith, swing around things and generally use your brain (and basic platforming skills) to get to the black hole, which allows you to unlock the next level.http://youtu.be/cjeeH7qRiK0Well worth the price - 9/10."
,Not Recommended,268320,18180513,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,genoforprez,"There is a really good game in here. It looks great and the controls and physics feel great. Unfortunately the thing that really kills it for me is the camera. It follows really close behind the blob and is always dropping behind pieces of geometry and obstructing your view. Movement is also relative to the camera angle, so if you have a really bad viewing angle around the geometry (which was often in my experience) and instinctively try to adjust the camera, then the blob goes veering off into oblivion.The gameplay footage in the trailers shows the blob swinging and gliding in these unbroken graceful arcs, but in all the levels I played, I felt like I kept having to stop so that I could move the camera around and actually see where the grapple points were located, because if I swiveled the camera while in motion, I'd veer off in a different direction and fall to my death. And this game has you crawling all over walls like spiderman, so your blob will go over the edge of a wall, and the camera just faceplants into the wall, so you try to correct the camera by swinging it around, but that messes with your movement, and it just makes a mess. I don't know. Maybe if there were some camera options to adjust camera controls or follow distance, but camera options are non-existent.Clearly I'm the minority opinion, but that camera and I just cannot work together."
,Recommended,268320,21726243,"Posted: 9 March, 2016",all,Andem,"I really like this game. It's incredibly smooth and fast paced. I find in this game you can be quite flexible in how you reach the goal most times. It's incredibly easy to start picking up and it just feels so good to be good at it.Something I really love about this game is that you'll usually be sending yourself in the air for just the right amount of time as to figure out how to position yourself for the next obstacle or jump.Just a bit of advice too. Try not going for the little point blocks every chance you get. The game is much more fun when you're just flowing through, and the point blocks don't do anything special. Keep them in mind when jumping, but don't ruin your run trying to get them.And if the gameplay doesn't quite click in the first 10 or so minutes, keep at it. Eventually you'll just have it down and be swinging like a proThe aesthetics aren't ugly, but nothing amazing. Music is nice too, nothing to stand out from it. No story. It's just a cheaply made very smooth-fast paced platformer, and i appreciate that.Some people complain about the camera, but I don't think that's all that valid for this game. You're in complete control of the camera and its up to you to position it so you can aim your grapple as well, so using a mouse is probably preferable over a controller. The levels are designed around this. There shouldn't be many times when the camera is working against you (since its all you controlling it), although I admit it can feel very weird navigating the curves/spheres at first, but it's just something you need to get used to for a couple levels.It's a great platforming experiance, but offers very little in terms of aesthetics but does rather well for how simple it is. For the price of 2 dollars i got it for, I think it was really worth it.TL;DR if you like platformers or games where you swing around and junk, you will like this game. What you see in the trailer is what you getthx ilu bye"

When I try to look at the   ground to see where I'm supposed to move to (on for example  speed run), it's as though  it's permanantely stuck in the upward position, so I can't look down to see where I have to  jump to. All I can see is a  set of  blocks arranged in a geometric shape that  I can move using the WASD keys.    I've tried grappling  the pieces of the puzzle  using the   appropriate keys, but  have not been able to progress at all.   Each time I try to look down it immediately returns to the  up position as seen in  Image 1 below.

You get to constantly hurtle yourself through the air and attempt all kinds of insane jumps and tricks.  The grappling ability is a very versatile mechanic that makes traversing a level challenging and fun.  My favorite levels were the ""junkyard"" style levels where there are random shapes all over the place, and you have to kind of experiment and figure out your own route through the level, but there's no one right answer.  I also loved any time you get to jump off a cliff, build momentum as you fall, then grapple something at the last minute, swing under it, and release with just the right timing so that you slingshot yourself toward your goal.  I also tended to like the various indoor stages, especially the second-to-last level where you have to explore the invisible rooms to find the doorways."

The game works as a casual exploration puzzle game, and supports speedrunning trials. The graphics are stylish and clear, and the music is very good. Gameplay is easy to pick up, deaths don't get in your way, and the levels are fair with checkpoints.I originally thought there were bugs with movement on vertical walls, but I found out that movement depends on your cursor aim. Placing the cursor directly on your blob will stop movement in all directions. Movement does get a bit awkward in 3rd person on vertical walls and spheres, but it's understandable. Seems like the major solution would be 1st person view, but that would be horribly disorienting I think. Still, the game is very enjoyable so far, and I'm satisfied with my purchase.

The swinging mechanic works well, and it  can be really fun flinging yourself around the environment. There are a ton of levels, and it has nice relaxing music. A few problems. It would be nice if there was more variety, as ou see the same 4 shapes or so, and theres only 3 different types of blocks. Spinning blocks, moving blocks, etc, would provide new and interesting challenges. The camera is completely awful. Its way too close, and when looking up, which makes you go up, you can't see how close you are to what's above you, and you can't see how close you are to what's below you. Since you need to look up constantly to grapple this can lead to many deaths. Also since its soo close when youre flinging around an object or moving quickly it can be hard to see what's around you. Another problem is the controls. The controls aren't specific to your position. If you are on the side of an object, pressing side doesn't move you to the side. You have to turn your camera so its behind you on the wall and you press forward to move that way. They should be structured moreso to your position and be consistent, as it can be confusing and finnicky. The other big problem is the attaching to objects. There seems to be no rhyme or reason when it happens. Sometimes i would be really close and it would suddenly not let me latch on, other times it would say I could, then as I got closer it would say I couldn't. Other times It would say I could, I would shoot and then I would keep falling and it wouldn't latch on. It's super erratic and I died so many times I shouldn't because it wasn't consistent. So there were some things holding this back from being higher, but all in all it's still a fun game.8/10."

They just work great and have this cool feeling of being intuitive yet hard to master.

While this may seem like a detriment, the increased view and an ability to hold down the left mouse button to grapple at the first opportunity would be fantastic QOL improvements, and leave an opportunity to faster paced, more technically complex levels.

The puzzle part of the game is more of gimicks and tricky level design. The game is very simple and there isn't much more to the game besides what the trailers show. There are currently 90 levels in the game and if you are good at these kinds of platformers you may spend as little as a couple hours completing all of the levels, however perfecting them may take longer.This game is nothing huge, the download is only a little more than 100 MBs and the game is cheap even when its not on sale. Grappler similar to games like A Story About My Uncle and Cloudburst with its overall structure. Mostly just platforming with new gimicks being introduced as you progress through the game. Graphically the game is pretty minimum with the same space overlay being used for every level in the game and platforms also using the same design throughout the game.The game worked perfectly fine for me, but that would have likely happened regardless because of my hefty PC build. Aside from that what is seen through the trailers is mostly what the game has to offer and Grappler is a decent little time waster if you don't know what to play at the moment and it kept me entertained enough to not put it down for a good hour or so."

Though this game lacks any kind of story element or graphical marvels, its simplistic yet unique aesthetic keeps the focus on the gameplay, which perfectly suits it.Every level uses the same dozen-or-so assets in the same way van Gogh uses the same dozen or so colors in any one of his paintings.  That is to say, each level is a breathtaking mesterpiece of design that leverages a few basic elements to create 90 unique puzzles, often challenging you to come up with new and provocative ways to utilize the tools you're given.  Naturally, at least the first half of the game is relatively accessible and doesn't require too much thought or effort, but towards the end, especially the last ten levels or so, you'll run into some very rough challenges that require a fair bit more precision than the rest of the game.  With that said, it should still be completable even by someone who's a bit more casual.  Just don't ask me about the time trials, those are for a different breed of platformer enthusiast altogether.And if all that sounds a bit too pretentious, the TL;DR is that it's a great platformer that's not overly difficult (unless you want it to be) and is unlike anything else presently on the market."

It's missing one very big feature that would make this game something I played regularly: leaderboards. While full game speedrun leaderboards can be handled onspeedrun.com, there are too many individual levels to be able to easily use external leaderboards. Having leaderboards for each level, the sum of all your IL times combined, and the full speedrun would add tens or even hundreds of hours of replayability for me. I really enjoy competing with my friends to get to the top of the leaderboard, and this game is perfect for that.
