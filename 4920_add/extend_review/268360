As first I thought ""ugh, what is this..."" played it for 2 minutes and felt in love with it. The AWESOME point about it - YOU generate the track, your enemies don't know what's coming. I mean, as first you make a track that is straight, suddenly you make a sharp right turn& so does the track generates at the goal a sharp right turn. Your enemies can't react that fast so they fall off the track.. but hey, it's not over yet.. they decide to press SPACE and fly back on the road! It's AWESOME! We just need more players, so guys - buy it, add me & lets play! :)"

Playing online is incredibly fun (particularly ping-pong mode), each game creates a different track with different ways to reach the goal, and it is fast-paced and requires you to plan ahead your course. I'm typically not a fan of racing games, but this one really appeals to me.For such a low price, I definitely recommend this game. It's fun to pick up and play a few races. My only problem is that people are rarely online (not the dev's fault); hopefully this will change with time."

76561198027809448,Not Recommended,268360,18266706,"Posted: 30 September, 2015",all,SBSam,"...Krautscape's trailer does the job well enough; cherry picks the best bits for others to see. I'll hand it to them; they gave the great impression of a game that promises high speed racing with the allure that, if you fly off the track, you can gracefully fly like a bird and reclaim victory from the jaws of defeat.Lies.Lies and deciet.Starting out the game, I headed to singleplayer; I heard multiplayer was basically non-existant, and I wanted get a grip on the controls, see how the mechanics worked....The controls are GARBAGE. Your car is not a car; it is a block of ice with a motor and it is HORRIBLY unbalanced in the air (one errant twitch, not going perfectly straight? Your straight rise up becomes a tumble).The first few levels try to teach you about how the car controls; turns and junk, have you pass through checkpoints. It'd be great if the car's turning wasn't ABYSMAL. Don't even think about using the brake, either; you just try to stop on a dime, and going fast and trying to make sharp turns with a that block of ice and a brake? You spin (like a record). You spin out, skid, stop. There goes your medal. Reset level.I had the patience to go an hour into the single player levels, and I didn't even get any flying action; it was awful turning with painfully slow acceleration (don't even get me started on boost pads coupled with tight turns; WHOOPS, THERE'S THE ENDLESS ABYSS) and a horribly slow restart back into the game.Super Meat Kart this is not; you have to pause. Hit reset. Go back to the start of the level, wait five seconds to start again, go with your slow start...and inevitably, crash and burn, time and time again.I was stuck on one level, a seemingly simple thing: bunch of boosts up a ramp, platform on the other side. You'd think they'd get THAT right....10 minutes. A sixth of my playtime. Dedicated to slowly accelerating to the boosts up, boosting up, rising...And hitting the tiny grey support platform in front of it, falling back down into the abyss, yet again. For ten minutes.I can finally see why people are skeptical about Early Access. You don't know what you're getting into, especially when a large percent of the reviews for this game are positive....I dove into the abyss, and came out a bitter, angry man.I'll think of giving this game another shot when things aren't awful, but for now, for those reading this that're skeptical?Buy it. See for yourself. And after you're done, give the dev a pat on the back and show him how to do things better.Make something better than...this."
,Not Recommended,268360,22252237,"Posted: 5 April, 2016",all,Cliff Excellent,"Krautscape is a racing game in which you build the track as you drive. Also, your car can fly. It's a neat idea, but it's so terrible in practice. The physics are the worst I've ever seen in a racing game. When you're flying your carplane will veer off in the wrong direction for no apparent reason. I can't tell if it's just buggy or if the game is supposed to be simulating wind, and doing a very poor job of it. Even on land the car controls like a giant icecube with a steering wheel attached. The trailer shows the car flying gracefully into the air like a bird, and doing sweet drifts to send the track exactly where they want it to go. None of this ever happens in the game. Attempting to drive around a corner is a horrible experience. And if you fall off the track (you will) you get sent right to the back. Not behind the last racer, right at the start of the track. The track does disappear when you drive over it, but if you're in the air, this doesn't happen. So if you attempt to skip a section of track by flying over it and you mess it up... you're gonna have to do it all again.I should explain how the the track building works. It chooses the next piece based on which part of the track the leader is driving on. If they drive on the left, the track curves to the left. But there's absolutely no reason to do this, it only makes your opponents more likely to overtake you. If you curve the track, you're gonna have to slow down to make the turn without falling off, giving your more reckless opponents a chance to zoom past you. Or you can risk falling off and waiting for your car to slowly respawn. Plus, it's probably just going to put your section of track closer to previous sections, making it easier for other racers to fly over and catch up. If you just drive in a straight line without curving at all, there's nothing the other racers can do to overtake you. There are no items or boosts that might help even things out. All you can do is keep driving and hope they somehow ♥♥♥♥ up. But because the leader never has to fly or make unexpected turns, their chance of ♥♥♥♥ing up is much lower than yours. When someone gets in the lead, they tend to stay in the lead.And then the final nail in the coffin: the multiplayer is dead. I have never seen a multiplayer game this dead. I could only find two people playing it, and they were just repeating the same mode over and over again. And of course there's no map variation to keep things interesting. There's a single player, but no AI racers. All you can do is drive the tracks on your own. Not much fun.I played for less than 2 hours so I could get a refund, but I could tell my opinion wasn't going to change. Great idea let down by terrible execution."
,Recommended,268360,21482353,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,katpotts,"Great art style and core gameplay mechanic is brilliant. While the game does have a singleplayer component the meat and potatoes of this game is the competitive multiplayer, in which you will compete with others to bend and curve the track to reach your objective before anyone else.Unfortunatley you may find it rather difficult to find anyone to play multiplayer with you. The community for this game has become so small since it's initial early access release that it's in your best interest to find one of your friends to play with rather than waiting for randos online. The controls in this game are also very floaty, your ""car"" has a very wide turning radius and the brakes don't really stop you but rather slow you down, the air controls can be a bit finicky at times but are overall solid.If you have a couple of friends to play this with I would definitley recommend picking it up, if not you might want to wait on it."

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.2. In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature and add the cookie dough layer later).Prepare the cookie dough layer:3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined. Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days).4. Cut the brownies: Run a knife along the sides of the brownie pan and then use the parchment paper to lift the brownies from the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice the brownies with a sharp knife, wiping the knife with a paper towel between cuts. If you'd like all of your slices of brownies to look clean-cut without edges, use the knife to cut the sides of the brownies off before cutting pieces. Keep brownies slices covered and chilled until ready to serve."

Gives off a new kind of high.Dislikes: Needs to improve on building tracks (like the tutorial needs to teach players how to finish tracks, I couldn't finish nor save any tracks), there needs to be different types of racing vehicles, It felt like a mix between FWD and AWD, but turning mechanics was awkward. I would enter a corner like a FWD, but exit like an AWD. Also, I wanted to know whether or not the wings had any effect on turning, wind resistance, drag coefficients, and downforce. There should be a menu on types of vehicles to choose and characteristics, like different style wings (concentrating more on mid air speed, turning speed, road speed, etc) mainly for individual racing benefits and disadvantages, this would make players think twice before choosing the best type of settings for the race. Building race tracks need more improvement for versatility, I ended up with bunch of turns that I didn't want, instead i wanted loops, jumps, etc. This would be excellent if it could incorporate building tracks like ""Trackmania,"" it gives more control over how a track can be created, deleted, modified. Also, I felt some major lag while turning. Like, as the game went on, the memory started to stack upwards, then the turning would delay, maybe because it had to save, and build up memory while racing. I played this on highest graphic settings. I would love to see updates to improve on this. Also, I would like to see ""key bindings"" in options, because it took me a while to find out what ""C"" button did. Also, sound settings need improvement, like sound vs. bgm music. I turned off sound but i kept hearing acceleration sounds, beeping sounds, etc. If the game allowed drifting, even in midair. I bet this game would hit at least, top 5 games of 2014-15."

Overall I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they really like simple but incredibly frustrating (challenging) control scemes. Also the flying isn't really flying, at best it's gliding with style and only really usuable on tracks where you are meant to use it and only when you are meant to use it. That said my experience only involves the first 1st or 2nd levels of each type of game mode as I just literally could not get passed them so I can't claim any sort of deep knowledge here but perhaps that speaks for itself in a way."

Even both at the same time!  I played split screen with my son.  He had the xbox controller and I on the Logitech.  We had a blast.  Adding flying to the game made it really interesting.  You learn where to use it to get ahead.Thanks for the Linux port!

,Recommended,268360,23952196,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,chuderluuri,"A very good game with some room for improvement though:This game has two main mechanics. The first in a race builds the track in 5 directions, depending on where he drives. You can either tightly turn left or right, slightly turn left or right or drive straight. The second mechanic is flying. you can lift off the track or cut curners by extending the wings on your vehicle.These two mechanics balance the game very well, since someone whos behind can often cut corners and overtake the one who is currently on the lead and has to build the track.What I liked about the game:- the game mechanic- the look- the musicWhat could be better IMO:- its rare to find a lot of people online (so get it and play pls) :P- the online game modes are not very well explained and I frequently see people in a races, that play bad because the dont know some basic tricks. (e.g. cutting the track in ""ping pong"", build towards the cube in ""collect"")- in single player, the difference between bronze and gold is often just a margin, which is quiet frustrating since you need at least bronze to carry on with the next level.Well spent 2 bucks."

As a car, the physics are lacking, and the handling felt uninspired. I also felt I was battling the controls (keyboard and mouse), either turning too much or too little, or diving when I should have been climbing in the air. THe latter is due to the unfortunate fact that the same up key that causes you to accelerate as a car sends you into a dive when you transform."
