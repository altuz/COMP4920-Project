This is basically a direct copy-update of the game.What you REALLY want though, is the Grand Campaign. That alone is worth the full price twice over, it's literally what it says on the tin. A grand campaign from 39-45 and it is much better paced than the stand alone game. It's also very good at representing what went on in the war and provides a nice learning curve. You'll stomp through Poland with ease, bounce up through Norway, smash the French as if they weren't there (after some minor resistance from the Belgians) and you'll feel epic as a General after having all those conquests. More so when you raid the Balkans.Then you go off against Russia, and it's easy, you smash them, underequipped, out of supply, un prepared. And you're laughing, over your German beer and with your fraulein sitting in your lap, you're one of the best army generals in the Nazi Regime.Then reality hits. The Russians mobilise, they get their airforce at you, their tanks roll towards you and the legions and legions of infantry just won't stop. Your puny Panzers' shells can't even stand up to their tanks, your anti-tanks get steamrolled, and its here, right on the battlefield in mother Russia that you'll find out whether your skills as a General are up to scratch. By the end of it, Poland and France will seem like a distant memory.Reckon you're up to the challenge? Prove it! This game will push you to the limit."

This game has great ratings, so you can read many other reviews on why PC is a good game. It does many things right - a neat branching scenario structure, solid foundation and some good voice overs to introduce the scenarios. For me, thats not enough and thus I'm going to explain why I don't think it's good enough to get a thumbs up.Simply put, PC is a remake of the old Panzer General games. And after playing this for 20 hours and playing those, I still think they're better games for one main reason: the Panzer Corps scenarios are usually very flawed.Panzer Corps makes the mistake of having too many units on too small of a map. There is little to no room for manuever. Thus the game is more puzzle-based than it is tactical. It's just a matter of figuring out that at ""x"" chokepoint I need 3 infantry, 1 arty and a tank to bust through. Once I know that, it's a matter of going to the next chokepoint. The time frames are always very tight, which rewards perfect unit usage and not necessarily good tactics. Seriously, whether you win or lose in any given map is often decided by your first half dozen combat results - if they're very favorable you're golden. If not, you're probably totally screwed.There are two types of battles - you're on the offense and you're on the defense. If you're on the offense, the AI is going to just sit back and let you come to them. There's no ebb and flow here - it's all a matter of finding the ""right"" way to knock down yet another brick wall. After playing a number of these scenarios, I felt like the Allies trying to fight through the German hedgerows - frustratingly slow, brute-force combat tactics because you can't manuever. It gets old, fast.If you're on defense, you can expect overwhelming odds since the AI isn't as effective as a human. So those scenarios are gamed up to present a challenge in numbers since the AI can't do it otherwise. They were, in a nutshell, disappointing.There are other issues as well. I find the map to be muddled and not attractive. It's a wargame, I know, and it doesn't need to be beautiful. But I'd personally rather have counters than the muddled color scheme presented here. The branching campaign is pretty neat but has some real issues - for instance, if do well enough as Germany and you're going to presented with an almost unwinable scenario in the USA. Do slightly worse and delay the US invasion by two years and you'll have a far more winnable scenario. That's just bad design. Sea power has almost no part in the game as well, so it's all ground and air combat. Combined arms need not apply in most scenarios.But it all goes back to scenario design - too many units, too small maps, no manuever and thus no imagination. I found them constricting. So why would I advocate paying for Panzer Corps (and don't get me started on the absurd DLC prices) when the old Panzer General II does it better? I can't. I'd rather play PG than PC and therefore PC gets the thumbs down. For those who are interested in the genre, I recommend Order of Battle: Pacific. It's a very similar game with larger maps, more fluid combat, combined arms and the maps aren't as muddled. To me it's a far superior game and easily worth the price difference."

It was the first time I enjoyed a wargame on a computer, while my first grognard experience happened some ten years before when I was ""inducted"" through Avalon Hill's Third Reich boardgame. So, yes, I like my wargames.Since this is a videoGAME review, I will try and wear the gamer's hat, rather than the hardcore grognard's helmet.This review is based on a playthrough of the Grand Campaign, Afrika Corps and Allied Corps, so all the ""DLCs"", the full enchilada.Pros:- While the replayability is quite low, if it takes 650 hours to play through: even at full price, the cost opportunity is pretty good like 10 cents an hour.- Each scenario is different and there's never a dull moment.- The game is easy to learn and quite hard to master.- The number of units (and the very different way to employ each and every one of them) as well as the historical research to build the scenarios is quite impressive.- The game is virtually bug free. This should be a given, but it's worth mentioning considering the amount of junk that is unleashed on customers these days (Football Manager 2014, Rome Total War 2, and so forth).- It runs smoothly on pretty much every rig / OS / graphic card.- Far from being flashy, the graphics do their job.- The addition of heros makes the experience more personal.- The heavily scripted AI does its job at keeping you challenged.Cons:- Increasing difficulty beyond General level, rather than giving you more challenges, just increases the number of enemies  / or their equipment quality (to very ahistorical levels).- The basic game feels like a demo compared to the Grand Campaign. definitely get all the DLCs.- The hero traits are too random (ok, this is the grognard talking, but, seriously, Artillery units with ""spotting"" traits and Air units with ""movement"" benefits are really useless / non-sensical).So, whether you are a gamer with a casual interest in World War 2 tactics or a tough wargamer who looks for something more relaxing, this game is damn near perfect."

As the name suggests, it is a Korps-level wargamer that focus on maneuver and combined arms tactics. It eschews complex supply lines and routes in favor of easy to understand icons and actions. Playing a grand campaign from the cobbled stones of Poland in 1939 to the plains of Ukraine in 1943 and back to ruined Berlin in 1945 is gratifying in the sense that you get a sense of ownership in the accomplishment of your units. They will earn their Ritterkreuz, and so will you too if you last that long.Multiplayer is good, not exceptional. Be prepared for a long evening if you so chose to play.A serious quibble in this otherwise impeccable game is the DLC's which seem to pester and tease gamers with content. The DLC's are quite enjoyable in its own right but not worth the asking price. Get the core game, it is worth it. Get the DLC's when they are on sale."

A classic game that's easy to learn, hard to master.  Complaints?  Two big ones:  the price and a lack of polish.  The price speaks for itself.  As far as the lack of polish goes, there's an unforgiveable absence of multiplayer features.  No leaderboard, not even a way to track your win/loss ratio.  The menus are cluttered, unorganized and rather ugly.  No Steam workshop support.  The game is practically screaming for these features but it seems that the developers have turned a def ear.  Perhaps they feel the game has enough content, and maybe they're right, but for the price they're asking, one would expect a more complete experience.A game anyone would certainly enjoy, but in it's current state, I can only recommend it when it's on sale...9/10"

On the other hand if you like to play all armies, say like in Panzer General, the game is rather expensive.Personally I love the genre as such and I'm looking very forward for the upcoming adaption of the 40K Universe.

76561197969951436,Recommended,268400,21140951,"Posted: 11 February, 2016",all,Rescue Toaster,"About the game:First off, it's ahex grid, turn based strategy game. You know, one ofthoseold strategy games from the 90's! It's actually an attempt to recreate Panzer General, which is a strategy game loved by many. ByME, anyway! If you don't know what Panzer General is, it's a virtual board game with hidden dice rolls, pretty basic audio and very minimal animation.Some of you might be turned off by the sound of that, but I think that this game incredibly immersive. I get frustrated when my enemy scores a rugged defense that thwarts my planned attack! I am fillled with joy when one of my units decimates the enemy and a hero emerges. I'm quite confident in saying that when you lose one of your units either due to a bad roll or just poor judgement, you will consider loading an older save to try and keep them alive.Some mechanics of the game:Each mission begins with specific set of auxilliary units. Auxiliary units are specifically set for only that mission so you won't have control of after them after the mission is finished. You could use them for dangerous situations because there's no real consequence for losing them. I wouldn't suggest just throwing them away, but sometimes that's what they are there for. Auxiliary units are represented by a grey color around the strength box. You are given""Prestige""at the start of each mission which is the currency of the game, used to buy your core units and reinforcing units(you also gain prestige by defeating enemies and capturing strategic points). Core units are what you will have throughout the campaign so take good care of them! They have a golden ring around the strength box.Core units will perform better than auxiliary units in almost all occasions due to having higher experience which gives your units bonuses. Throughout the campaign new units will be unlocked and it's a good idea to upgrade your units. Upgrading your old Panzer II's up to Panzer III's for example. Your units gain experience through combat, medals through participation or deeds, and like I mentioned before, heroes through excellence. When you reinforce a damaged unit you can either use fresh recruits which are cheap but it reduces the experience of the unit as a whole, or veteran replacements which cost significantly more, but alow you to keep your current experience value.Your units are represented by an icon and a strength number. The strength number represents the number of men available in the unit who can fight (it isn't literally 10 men or tanks, it's just a representation on a scale of 1 to 10+). Over time, through combat, your units can gain experience and levels. When they gain a level they can be reinforced to be an 'over strength' value. Over strength meaning that they can be brought up to 11, 12 or even 13 strength value. They will perform better of course, but the trade off is that it costs substantially more to reinforce the unit above 10.Your units have more detailed statistics which range from:Attack values against soft(infantry, some artillery, trucks, etc), hard targets(tanks, half-tracks, bunkers, etc), air targets(.. planes, planes, etc)and naval attack(against ships der)Defense values for ground or air attacks and also what type of defense your unit uses(soft, hard, air or naval).View range(how many hexes they can reveal)Movement distance and what type of movement they use. Certain movement types travel over certain terrain types more easily than others. There is tracked, wheeled and good ol' fashion 'Leg'!.Close Defense is how well the unit defends itself in urban or forest areas or when they are ambushed.Finally, 'Range' is how far the unit can attack from. Your standard infantry or tank unit can only attack enemies next to them. Artillery on the other hand can attack from a distance usually 2 to 3 hexes away.Units also have an ammo count and if applicable a fuel count which both need to be resupplied after a while. Ammo is  how many attacks or defensive shots you can make before needing to use a turn to be resupplied (a unit without ammo cannot return fire which is something you can exploit!). Fuel is fairly self explaining, a unit uses 1 fuel for every hex it travels. Resupplying restores both ammo and fuel, so it's got that going for it..TLDR;The game, while it may look fairly simple by it's screenshots or videos, has a lot of complexity to it for you to use to your advantage and I find it highly rewarding.Something about the campaigns:You start out with having tutorials teaching you the basics(you'll have to come up with your own strategies and tactics to get decisive victories!). Then you move into the campaigns. You can choose from 4 with the base game which determine the time you want to start the war at and the battles you'll take part in. Some of the missions overlap in the campaigns but it depends on your choices and victories / losses.Someone made a neat chart that tells you which missions are in each campaign:http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/3318332566192367118/183E683584A5430315E3D95789E1D0CE1F7DE724/As you can see on that chart, the base game has in total 40 different missions. Add to that that you can change your core army around which can make the same mission play very differently and you have yourself a lot of replayability! Want an army heavy with panzers and mechanized infantry to flank and destroy enemies from behind? Or how about one focusing on a large number of pioneers and artillery to break through ANY defense? The choice is yours and there are a lot of choices.The game follows history to a certain degree, like when the war began and certain historical battle dates, but you can drastically alter history. For example: you can go as far as conquering the United States after conquering Russia.I'd say that the 'Grand Campaign' DLC's are the way to play this. The base game is great, but it's sort of a 'lite' version. The GC goes into further detail with the stages of the war. Instead of 4 missions conquering Poland it's 10 or so(14 all together but there are branching choices and situations)but this is straying into a review for the DLC now.[h1TLDR again?;[/h1] This game can be simple yet complex. Bland yet immersive. Yet, yet yet! Honestly, I think it's worth well over $20. It goes on sale once in a while so if you're on the fence just wait for one of those. This is definitely a game no strategy fan should miss.I apologize for this poorly structured novela of a review. This is my first real 'review'  and any feedback or discussion is greatly appreciated. Want me to never write again? I'll see what I can do! Thanks for checking it out!"

Panzer Corps is a nice clone, but there are several drawbacks from the original.  Graphics wise there have been SOME improvements but some nice features of the original PG were left out.  Such as cut video scenes from WW2 and also during gameplay there are no battle boxes in the corners of your screen showing your troops fighting.  Minor details that might not be important to some but I think add a lot to the experience.  The objectives in Panzer Corps also are really difficult to acheive if you play with the fog of war on and anything above easy difficulty, which is really unfortunate.  In the original PG you had enough moves to achieve your objectives and have a decent shot of getting major/decisive victories, but not so in Panzer Corps.  I'm not sure what the developers were thinking as most maps you have between 10 and 13 moves to capture all objectives (for decisive victory) which on most maps is impossible.  Lastly, as a lot of reviewers have noted the game has only a fraction of the scenarios the original PG had, so you have to buy all the stupid DLC's to get the full package, which is a TOTAL ripoff.  My advice is to try and find a copy of the original PG for free and play that.  However you might like Panzer Corps for brief nostalgia."

The very simple mechanics provide a very tactical feel--the type of unit and the order in which they move and shoot is a core concept:  the game rewards good combined arms tactics (as does real life)--that keeps the game moving without being bogged down in tactical details (other titles provide that fix).  You also get a strategy game since you must decide on what battles to fight, and based on prestige gained in your battles, what equipment to buy or upgrade or overstrength, where to deploy to start and then plan a course of action.  This provides a role playing aspect as you must decide on how to build your core and then grow your units in experience by earning awards via combat efficiency and potentially gaining a hero that then provides additional tactical benefits to the unit.  It has another what if aspect when building the core:  do I go armor heavy and win with tanks or dominate with air power disregarding that artillery is the king of battle or use recon or airborne or engineers or other options to explore or replay trying a completely different mix (seapower is used but not as part of your core with the capital ships all historically named--that is awesome).  You can be rewarded with some Special Experience units that add to you core and provide extra assets that come in very handy when used properly.The scale of the maps and the number of units always gives you room to manuever (some reviews disagree):  it is another key concept.  The base game requires you to move out and take your objectives (some have said that is a detractor--but good tactics can overcome this issue and you may need every turn to get that decisive victory).  The DLCs allow some flexibility by providing an adjustment to ease the hurried feeling.  The situations in the scenarios (maps) are always interesting and contain solid historical and actual geographic elements plus at times actual units or leaders for the particular battle.  The DLC's add some very challenging tactical twists using very innovative objectives.  The DLC's also provide some surprises both as tactical problems or a very special reinforcement to your core (some very powerful units with perhaps a potential flaw) and some rewards for good battlefield management via captured equipment (a very nice touch).It is just fun and addicting: you ALWAYS want to play just one more turn and that will get you in serious trouble with the significant other!  I played Panzer General (and some other titles in the 5 Star series) and this game has taken the original concept far beyond that great start.  The DLCs push the limits even more.  Bravo Zulu Matrix and Slitherine!"

I played PG 3d and 'Scorched earth' years ago and wanted something not too simplistic but not requiring a college text to learn. I found the perfect balance in Panzer Corps, a game I have been unashamedly addicted to since the beginning of the year.For older gamers like myself that prefer turn-based games that have strategic/tactical depth and an immersive experience, PC is a near-perfect fit. I've slogged my way through the stock campaign as well as 90% of the DLC available. I've spent almost 1k hours loving this game and I haven't even touched the modding community's offerings yet!For people with an above average understanding of WW2 history, armies, equipment, and tactics this game is a pleasant dream come true. However, some of my complaints are the lack of simple features:a- Animations could be improved to show tank treads moving, truck wheels turning, soldiers marching, etc. 2D terrain appears dated, could use simple enhancements like trees swaying in the wind, water moving, waves on beaches splashing.b- There could be more differentiation between tactical styles for different armies (I've found that using the same style of play works the same for Germans, Soviets, or Americans),c- Units on high ground (hills, mountains, forts) should have stronger attack/defense benefits,d- Comprehensive GC includes many what-if scenarios....but WHY isn't the Pacific war ever included in the official DLC?? I mean c'mon, its not that hard to model the USMC/USN taking on the Japanese across islands, the Phillipines, Okinawa, and a what-if invasion of mainland Japan.

A marginal victory is cause history to play out normally, but a decisive victory will lead into scenarios like Operation Sea Lion.  Furthermore, your core units (as long as they survive) will persist between scenarios in the campaign, they can also gain medals and have heroes added to them depending on their performance.  If you are a strategy fan this may scratch that itch for you."

So many indie games have tried to copy Panzer General, a seemingly simple task, and failed. Unit experience, branching campaigns, over strength units, huge numbers of individual vehicles and infantry types, and a simple and clean interface. This one ships with small campaigns and a full grand campaign that branches in alt-history directions, but once you play that you will want to start picking up the add-on packs, which imho are worth the price of admission. Just buy them as you play them or wait for a big sale. My advice, after you've played through the main game, pick up the Afrika Korps campaign. It's long, with more alt history twists and turns if you succeed at your objectives.I have spent a lot of good money on lame pretenders to the PG throne on Steam over the years. Here, finally, is a worthy successor."

It's easy for a new player (new to Panzer Corps or new to turn-based strategy games) to learn but not easy to win, especially in some nasty missions. I have never played 1990s  Panzer General (i am too young for that game), so i can't tell the difference, but i think the developers did all the right things and created a 2010s classic, i think it's more than just a modern remake. The number of various units the game contains is mind blowing. Although is not a simulation game by any means, the player has a feeling that he plays real battles from World War 2 and not just a chess like game.I totally recommend Panzer Corps to any person that wants to play TBS games, newbie or veteran, this game is very good introduction to new players that want to enter the TBS genre and provide much challenge and fun to veteran players too.A classic.10/10"
,Not Recommended,268400,13610085,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,-=Schutzenbauer=-,"Cons:- EXPENSIVE ($80 for a collection !!!)- Repetetive (click, point, click, point, click, point, etc).- While overall the graphics are fine, some aspects remain problematic.  Trees are extremely tiny, look like bushes on the map, forests or trees adjasent to forests extend over tiles which are classified as fields making strategic planning often burdensome- Simplistic.  Units health = 10, what does this mean?, why not show actual numbers of soldiers, equipment?  Supply map is not well explained/shown/integrated/conceptualized by the player, while supply is very important in grand strategy games in Panzer Corp you can be encircled over a wide area and still be fully supplied, how is that possible? Simply run on the map to the marked points (usually cities), knocking out enemy units on the way without worrying much about supplies, partisants or any other side-aspects of a typical 20th century warfare.  Very limited focus on units morale (all units generally have high morale, I guess German morale in Russia in the 1940s was generally good <-- NO IT WASNT, look at historic photographs and battle statistics)- No understanding what the units actually represent leads me to form a very poor bond with myunits.  Are these units divisions, armies?  What are these formations? (for exmaple, AT gun unit, does this mean its several platoons with AT guns?, but then how can this be when the map streches over 100s of kilometers and there are only about 60 units on the map).  When a unit reaches 0/10 its destroyed (kind of an arcade time count)- No battle/war statistics displayed at the end of each campaign/war (this is a historic grand strategy game so tables, graphs, performance charts is a MUST HAVE! )Pros:- Decent selection of equipment from the era.- Decent graphics with well visible/recognizable unit icons- Awards to particular units for bravery or other special achievements- Simple click, point and click strategy game on a hex-based board layout (this might be a drawback for some, see below)________________________________________________________________More about the problems:The collection is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, the game is basically the old Panzer General series, its a simple hex-based board game, with slightly better (its a 2D graphics so you shouldnt expect much in the graphics department), maybe a few new units and mostly just new maps.  I mean COMMON $80 for dozens of new 2D maps for $80, REALLY?  Skyrim with its excellent 3D graphics and a much more complex engine was not even as expensive as Panzer Corps Collection is now.  Yes the developers state that this is a BRILLIANT REMAKE or some crap like that on their website, however they dont justify that argument with neither specific explanations about why its presumably so much better than the old, nor have I experiance anything new playing this game.  Considering that you can get Panzer General 2 for several dollars online and there hundreds (if not thousands) of FREE maps/campaigns made over the last 20 years or so which can be downloaded online, the games price is simply out of norm at the moment.  Also, some aspects of the older games were actually better than in this most recent one.  For example, I actually preferred the terrain in Panzer General 2 over this game (e.g., vegetation type, such as tree cover, was far more pleasent and recognizable in the old one).  Automatic switching between ground units and air units (e.g., when you move an air unit to attack a ground unit) is very clumsy and in some cases does and sometmes it does not result in an attack (you have to execute the command once more after you place the air unit of ground unit to attack).  There are other problems with the game, but these do not neccessarly reflect a sole problem of Panzer Corps but rather a general design flaw with hex-based war games (e.g., AT guns = if these are inf units equiped with AT guns, why are they weaker than regular inf units which lack AT guns?).Publishers Censorship:Aside from the game itself, the developer has been known to block/censor people on steam forum who complain about aspects of the game, such as the extremely high cost of the game.  Basically someone posts a message stating that the game price is overblown, then some other users (potentialy someone who works for the developer as this has been repeated numerous times on steam forum) posts a comment criticising the original comment with some unpleasent remarks (not even swear words), then the original poster responds to it with more unpleasent remarks (again, no swear words) and then the publisher quickly blocks the post and bans the original person posting the comment criticising the high cost of the game PERMANENTLY stating that the person has made an unpleasent comment !  Simple corporate scheme to block critique against the buisness strategy of the company."

I have played almost 500 hours so far of DLC and the original Panzer Corps game, and will be getting the Gold Pack soon (probably tonight).  I have made it through the Grand Campaign with decisive victories in every game.The Good:1) The campaigns are incredibly done.  They are very challenging and well thought out.2) The game hasn't crashed on my system once and no errors in almost 500 hours of playtime.3) The units you can buy are very balanced in terms of expense and effectiveness.4) Hours, upon hours of exciting gameplay.The Bad:1) Unlike Panzer General, Air units, cargo units and even AA guns (on one particular map) will spawn and attack you or move in the same turn.  This adds a dynamic element to the game because you cannot just farm the enemy airfields and wait for spawning air units, but it also creates a situation where your best laid plans might fail due to circumstances beyond your control and can be annoying sometimes.Overall Assessment:This game is incredible and if you like stradegy games, you will love this game.  Buy it and love it.  It is truly one of the best games I have ever played and I have over 30 years of gaming experience, from RPG's, MMO's, stradegy games, console games, etc., and it ranks in my top 5 of all time.

At first, it seems quite slow and cumbersome. The graphics aren't great and moving pixelated squares around may not seem exciting. However, once you play the 5th tutorial battle you are right in the middle of a full-on battle and trying desperately to counter the AI. The difficulty level is quite high and single player is a challenge. Your army gets stretched as you go across the map and you have to make quick decisions on where to reinforce, and how many units to move where. On a tactical level this game is very good.Battles move along quickly with fast fighting, and it is very easy to load up a game in your campaign and play a game or two after work. There is not much strategic planning as there is no base building, no allocating resources over wide areas, and no planning on a grand map. All the strategic decisions are made as you play your battles with units carrying over into your next battle, and new units being made available before each battle.It is quite a simple design but the battle mechanics are very good, and with even the early battles being a challenge it really keeps you engaged. The campaign DLCs add a lot of content as well. Recommended for wargamers, and especially so in the frequent Steam sales. 8.5/10"

Panzer Corps is our dream world made real! They've taken the original Panzer General and produced a modern(-ish) version of it. More detail, more units, bigger maps, more scenarios. They've also now used the DLC idea to add a Russian General version and a modern take on Allied General. They've designed and produced a massively expanded version of the original German campaign by introducing the 'Grand Campaign' idea which lets you fight a series of linked campaigns with several battles, one campaign for each year of the war from 1939 to 1945.If you're a fan of map-based, turn-based WW2, go buy it.

Go watch a few of ReneMesis' YT playthroughs of the first campaign.  You either are an addict waiting to happen, or you really aren't.  Watching our good Norwegian commentator celebrate or bemoan his fate will tell you which you are.  And that's probably what you came down here for anyway.If, however, you want to do it the hard way, or look for ' Review Rembrandts ' painting word pictures with light... well.God help you.REVIEWAs many reviews here suggest, this game shows a clear descendance from Panzer General (for those who remember that venerable series).  Those older still, will recognize the style as the computerized form of SPI games or Avalon HIll's Squad Leader Series =  Boardgames with cardboard maps and real dice, so absorbing that shouts and hand slamming could punctuate play, with teams of players hanging on every die roll - cursing and posturing at foul or fair fortune.I love this game, so for those who want the perspective of a fan, I will put up the main things that I respctfully still find some fault with - and later why those didn;t keep me from acquiring and enjoying the title.Problems1)This game brings all that good stuff back I mention in the first para.. but obviously with the ease and greater detail possible only in a computerized instance.  While Panzer Corps is every bit as addictive as I remember those old games being this comes at a price as multiplayer is only asynchronous PBEM and only 1v1.  A shame, even if it is understandable with the limited objectives of the designers, this should not keep serious players from considering this title if they have the necessary green.  And that's another thing...2)At the time of thie writing, the regular price for this aging title is simply too high, with all the DLCs and the base game still costing $140 US when not on sale.  You need those DLCs to play the grand campaign which is by far the queen of the chessboard of experiences of the title, and would leave a big hollow place in one's game world not to have.  We purchased a few copies of this while on a 70% sale so the total bundle amounted to around the price of a regular Triple A title.  Thats for a title that is 5 years old, even if it IS a huge title in terms of content and an incredible amount of work is contained in it.  Many people probably don't care about large segments of that body of work... regardless of the depth it may add to the game experience.3)Repetition of scenario format and victory conditions makes some people go 'spla' and it can be a bit annoying at times since other means of accomplishing a scenario objective clearly offer themselves, and any afficianado of WW2 can think of dozens of objectives in history that could be modeled easily enough.Benefits1)Library.  The detalied library of all the equipment provided in the game is an amazing resource and is accompanied by enlargeable diagrams.2)This highlights a lot of the ways in which the game models supply, fuel, and replacement.  It feels right, and the various equipment and formations feel properly weighted because of that research as well as clearly, a great deal of playtesting.3)There are few bugs.  No show stoppers.  Weird.  (heh !)4)WHen its on sale its a good value.  Many many units, and plenty of diversity.5)Granular control and difficulty settings.6)Not a computer hog, and while it is fun to look at, its no eye candy maven.  If you are looking for something to throw tri-sli at, you've taken a wrong turn somewhere...  (Hah ha ha ha!)7)If you leave it set to reasonable variation of results (die roll), there will be those times you WILL be grumpy and cry out loud... put your face in your palm, and reel so far back... ""that you can clutch a fringe or two of the windy past"" when we rolled real dice, and shouted ""GODDA--- uhhhh ---NICE!""Buy it on sale. but do get it if watching a playthrough makes you want to watch another one.  :)  ~'Crazy Uncle' Al"

76561198008618271,Not Recommended,268400,25593875,"Posted: 19 September, 2016",all,Aurlord,"This is difficult to say, since I was an absolute fan of SSI's Steel Panthers and later of Panzer General (of which Panzer Corps claims to be the offspring and evolution), but Panzer Korps falls short of its promises.I was so excited by the prospect of playing again one of my favourite war games of all time that I bought the whole bundle (admittedly on offer). Not only I enjoyed the original game, but I also contributed to it by creating several community maps since I am a military history buff.If you played the older titles the interface looks immediately familiar and you can jump straight into the game. The graphics haven't greatly changed either, and although I don't mind the retro-look as I don't play this kind of games for the visual effects, something a little more refined wouldn't have hurt.The main problems with Panzer Corps are the game balance and the map design. Most scenarios are won or lost in the first few turns if you can (or most often can't) take control of some ""chokepoints"" (mostly fortified towns held by overly-strong A/T units). Any delay will inevitably lead to failure. Since most available routes pass through the chokepoints you'll have to fight at a disadvantage. Problem is in most scenarios the A/T units in built-up areas are way too strong and can stop any armour you throw at them. Infantry would be a good option in these circumstances IF it could be moved fast enough, but most of it will lag behind. So you'll need a lucky hit that knocks out the opposition before you take too much damage or lose too much time. And it often really comes down to that, a lucky hit.During WWII both tanks and A/T evolved in time, with one or the other (usually the tanks) gaining the upper hand as circumstances went, but in Panzer Corps you'll find your expensive armoured units shot to pieces by oddly powerful cheaper units.There is very little in Panzer Corps which wasn't already in Panzer General while the scenarios are a lot less balanced. Ultimately a disappointing game, though one I relly really wish had turned out better.---------- Read further if interested in more details and response to comments in thread -----------In response to comments I'll expand my critique of the game for those interested.The main problem of Panzer Corps is that it changed its scope from a tactical game (such as were Steel Panzers and Panzer General) to a strategic one. This in itself could be a good thing but it is only half implemented.The scale (not necessarily the actual size) of the maps is much larger, encompassing entire countries, BUT the units fighting on them (and their combat values) are still tactical units. So, for example, you may happen to attack Paris with a couple of panzers, which is plainly absurd, facing a couple of A/T units. In tactical combat a decent A/T unit at close quarters could easily knock out a few tanks. However, the game has the ambition of being played at strategic level (hence the Grand Campaigns scenarios) so the units shown on the map should necessarily be strategic units, ie Panzer Regiments or larger formations.Panzer Divisions were COMBINED ARMS units, their strength being the mix of Motorized Infantry (Panzer Grenadieren), Tanks and Artillery, plus fast recce units (motorcycles and armoured  halftracks). On the other hand there were no A/T divisions in any army at the beginning of WWII. Germans never set up any such units for the whole course of the war as they were deemed too expensive. Soviets set up A/T artillery divisions only in 1943.So the game places on the same level tactical A/T units and strategic armoured ones, thus the unbalance. This is why the A/T units are very cheap in comparison. The game is basically an hybrid and doesn't quite succeed in either the tactical challenge (where Steel Panzers excelled) or the strategic one, as manoeuvre is overly hampered by chokepoints.In the end this is just a game. You may like it or not and anyone is entitled to his own views. I am happy to have a civilised exchange of opinion, but I find Cuqueen remarks about my military knowledge insulting and showing poor manners."

There are many (mostly visual) improvements and as many additional complications, but the game remains fundamentally the same-a somewhat simplified tactical wargame worthy of many classic board war games (thanks to TTG, WRG, SSI and their pioneering predecessors) and the original PG itself, born of those little cheap boxed map-and-counter games those of us old or keen enough to remember started with. I would recommend the basic game at the start-veterans may miss the irritating arbitrariness of the original (weather and supply reducing the game to a perfect and deeply aggravating historic re-enactment are still optional, thank goodness!), but I believe as a veteran tabletop wargamer of thirty years that you will still find the challenge inherent in the original game, but with some shiny extra features that may please you. I must add that I am currently ploughing through the original game, crrently on sale (24 Feb 2016) and as such I must also add that DLC is also available. However I have chosen to avoid the DLC for now until I am familiar with the main game, in order to ensure that I know what I am letting myself in for. Feel free to do as you like, but as an ""old sweat"" familiar with long drawn-out military campaigns fought from the safety of my own four walls, this will do and saves me hours of setting up a table and putting it all away afterwards."

That was over 40 years ago and how things have changed... After progressing through the ZX Spectrum and Atari ST, I finally arrived at a 386DX and MS-DOS 5, a platform that was to develop into the best and most versatile gaming system the world has to offer.There was Perfect General, Panzer General, History Line to name a few. I loved the simplicity of Panzer General 2 and Battle Isle 2 over the wargames with more complex rules, preferring to play than read rule books. Last year I discovered Panzer Corps and was amazed at how easy it was to pick up and play, it must be the most accesible wargame ever.I've now played through the base game, and went back and replayed it a couple a times to make sure I had a go at all of the scenarios. I read a few tips to sharpen my game and have worked out the whole combined arms thing. I've moved on to Africa Korps on my laptop but I'm replaying the original game on my desktop on Field Marshal diffculty (my first go was on Colonel). I've bought all the DLC up to and including Sea Lion as I know it's going to take me a long time to tire of it.For the hard core wargamer who likes a thick book of rules and calling up off map artillery and air support, ensuring tanks are facing the right way and every realism nailed down, Panzer Corps might be too simplistic. But for a more casual wargamer who wants to flick through a thin rule book and do his learning on the battlefield, it's perfect. There's a great support community on the Slitherine website, and DLC keeps getting released. Highly recommended for those who want to play a solid wargame without having to go on a course first."

I personally found the turn crunch my least favorite part of the game.The unit scale seems to be maybe company level, but its not entirely clear. The distances of each hex is once again unclear.Which is fine, the game abstracts a lot and that keeps it simple, the game maybe falling a little short of being a ""hard core"" wargame.

Allied Corp, the AI is fairly scripted which makes save scumming the generals greatest weapon.

Italians, while the US enters the fray only in the middle of it);- experience cap in the Grand Campaign (which also features in its East Branch the most lame finale ever, Epilogue) and the US Grand Campaign, meaning that your units won't get any any experience beyond a limit which is set for every campaign in the GCs;- lack of historical identities/particularities, one campaign feeling pretty much like any other one (definitely a problem for the Soviet Corps) and all of them feeling like a tedious hurdle race with a predetermined ending.I'm not much into multiplayer, but from what I've seen so far it's functional and divided in two. One part features terribly non-descript and generic maps, perfectly balanced both in terms of units and terrains, with no historical realism whatsoever. The second part, much more interesting, features the vanila campaign scenarios, where somewhat more realistic conditions apply, thus turning a battle against a human opponent into a vastly different and challenging gameplay, with almost no relation to what goes on in the campaign.*To be fair, prestige cap can be avoided by choosing to play with another rule set, but this also disables some useful later patch additions. Experience cap, on the other hand, can't be avoided."

The PC adds a little bit on the animated graphics front but it's basically a turn based strategy game. There's a lot of depth in it, it works really well and is quite challenging, but the learning curve is really enjoyable (forever cursing those dice-rolls!)

Not all of them are good, and the game can sometimes feel badly balanced, especially in MP. RNG still rules the day. Multiplayer only supports PBEM, although the turns are handled by in-built servers so there's no messing with email. The pricing on DLC campaigns is the usual Slitherine policy, as in expensive, but they do include PG1 style WW2 German campaign in the base game so it's good as such.For those who aren't General series veterans - it's a good starting point for a new strategy game player. The mechanics are simple but the game is challenging. You have to learn how to balance your force roster, which units to upgrade, how to advance, scout, exploit openings and weaknesses of the enemy etc. Maps have alot of variance and if you fight well enough, you can change the course of history and achieve what the German military machine failed to."

In the campaign DLCs it is broken down into securing areas around the city on differnt maps then you play a map with the city.Allied Corps is like Panzer Corps focusing on the major actions in WWII.Overall plenty of content I found the $80 additional for extra a little steep but got it on sale at a price I thought fair.

The default seemed a touch too easy but with the selection of AI 2 and increasing AI prestige I've got all the fight I want from the computer and more.Very fun. Just what I was looking for.Suggestions for improvement (or for a sequel) from me include:1) better color highlighting of units to distinguish friend from foe. My eyesight isn't what it used to be.2) better dynamic zooming of the battlefield instead of just  ""in and out"" with the map (ala sid meyer games)3) More detailed battlefield projection tooltips**What I mean here is instead of a hover forcast of projection win-loss if I commit to an attack I would like not only those numbers but below them i would like a quick summary of why--i.e. why I am forcasted to lose 5 or half my strength is because my unit has a horrible hard attack and I am attacking a triple fortified hard opponent for example.I know I can find this information out by clicking each individual unit and will learn certain characteristics over time, but it would be nice to have some of this at hand without the additional clicking and number crunching.Very much recommend this game!"

,Recommended,268400,9676351,"Posted: 30 March, 2014",all,Lisbon,"Panzer Corps is a turn-based strategy or ‘wargame’. Each scenario you are tasked with deploying your troops and taking a set number of objectives across the map. Units earn experience and can be upgraded during the deployment phase with any new equipment unlocked. This is done using prestige points that you acquire by completing objectives and are also used to reinforce units during battle when they lose strength. Prestige points are persistent throughout the campaign meaning spending all of your points in one battle may not be wise as you are effectively depleting your resources for the next engagement; although you do receive some at the beginning of each scenario, what you have carries over.The graphics of Panzer Corps are fairly basic although nice to look at with each type of unit distinguishable from each other. Sounds can also said to be somewhat basic as each unit type has a single sound that is played during movement and attack. This may sound repetitive however after 18 hours of playing Panzer Corps I can say this has yet to bother me. The interface is effective at doing the job and gives you access to all of the information you need without being intrusive.Panzer Corps strikes a great balance between depth and accessibility and offers a great entry point into wargames for the uninitiated. The gameplay is addictive and the visuals and audio serve the game well, while the multiplayer uses a play-by-email method so multiple games can be played at once over the course of a few or more days.Panzer Corps has quickly become one of my favourite games and I would happily recommend it to anyone."

It is one of the best turn based WW2 strategy games that I have ever played. It is easy to get into but has tactical depth.  Large variety of units to build your core army with throughout the game, there is nothing like having an early panzer crew survive long enough that they are a vetern Tiger crew by the games end.  Only downside is the Afrika Corps and Allied Corps are not stand alone because the original Panzer Corps is made obsolete by the Grand Campaign DLCs.  The Grand Campaign DLCs are by far the best value in each being a whole campaign in which your core units are saved and can be carried over to the next chapter of the war.  Allied Corps is great and allows you to play the western Allies starting in North Africa until victory in Western Europe.  Afrika Corps is great and featres some of the more challenging battles in the series while focusing on DAK and Italian forces in North Africa.  Great to finally see Slitherine/Matrix games apearing on steam for the historical strategy gaming crowd."

This animation was extremely interesting as it showed you what your units were attacking and how much damage they are doing in a visual appearance instead of the basic fly over a target and see a smoke cloud appear and numbers go down.Overall the game is extremely fun for those wanting a turn base game as well as something that doesn't really need much thought just mainly which units can effectively counter the other. If your really 50/50 on it just wait for a sale the price is extremely cheap during this time...as well as it won't laugh at you for hating it so much.......I really hate you brink...you simply just sit in my library mocking me....with all bugs...one day I will have my revenge"

Many people will remember Panzer General from many years ago and you can still download it for free! The game might have been dressed up a bit but it's basically just the same limp excuse for a wargame - at least many years ago it seemed acceptable as there wasn't much else available because of the pc's being basic. At best it was an ok boardgame type game but doesn't have the realism of Battle Academy or Close Combat, or Combat Mission either. I don't know what scale these battles are supposed to be represented in, certainly not at the small scale seen in BA, CM or CC. In PC the battlefields are on a much larger scale which makes the problem of infantry not accompanying tanks in the same hex laughable. The Devs have also DLC'd it to death and if you buy the lot then you're going to part with a small fortune. I tried just the base game and at once I could see it was the same old game just with new window dressing.

It doesnt do 1900x1200, the maps have some depressing colors and you cannot see what units are yours and what are the ones lended to you.You also dont have some simple unit characteritics that allows you to see which units are elite units (unless you ressuply them to their maximum allowed) or to see if they got any medals.Second, the gameplay is actually bad. It seems that all the enemy units have some ungodly experience and they will just wreck even your most experienced units 1v1. The difficulty comes by just reducing your prestige income and incresing the number of enemies and/or their experience level. Dont hope for AI getting smarter with the increased difficulty, is just the old system of do more with less resources.I bought the gold version with all the dlc and I now think that I have wasted my money.I tried to ask for a refund but because I played 6 hours instead of the maximum 2 hours allowed for the refund, my reaquest was refused.Well, that is okay, I wil never buy games from Steam anymore as they no longer have the monopoly for games distribution platform.You should imagine my dissapointment about this game if I had to post this review but dont waste your money on this game like I did.For what it offers, this game doesnt deserve even 5$ not mentioning the 45$ that I paid on it.Huge letdown from both the game and Steam, I will never recommend any of them to anyone anymore."
76561198063824871,Recommended,268400,13236175,"Posted: 5 December, 2014",all,Roderick ''Blutbad'' Feldrank,"Panzer Corps can be qualified as a successor to the famous and rewarded Panzer General series.In this game you take command of the German forces in World War II, sometimes assisted by their allies and must complete various objectives such as destroying a target or more often conquer the map. Panzer Corps is a turned-based 2D game which means that you organise your movements, attacks or other strategic action before the enemy does his.The German campaign will lead you in several theaters of the war such as the invasion of France, the taking of Norwegian's Narvik city, the assistance of Italian troops in their invasion of Greece or the famous operation Barbarossa. The campaign offers a continuity in the various operations which means you will keep your units from a theater to another. That way you will quickly care for your troops as they gain experience, medals and war heroes and you will try to keep the best of your regiments alive. Loosing a battle does not mean the end of the campaign or that you will automatically have to start again but you will continue the fight with a scenario according to your defeat.Now let's see the highs and lows of the game :[/b]- Good replayability : with various difficulties and numerous strategies possible you will like to start again a scenario and try to win it a different way.- The difficulty levels : They really offer a different difficulty which will accomodate the different kinds of players from novice to the master generals/- The map is not just there to be pretty: Like a proper wargame, terrains matter. You may not want to attack while crossing a river, forests take longer to cross and units will move differently depending on their transport system ( trucks, on foot,...Etc )- Graphisms : Some will say come on we are in the 2010s but I like the graphism. The interface is very good and clean which is not always the case in these games and the units are clean as well. Once you are accustomed you will recognize the unit by their looks easily.- The sounds : there are not many sounds but they are correct and not horrible. Repetitive but very correct. The same goes with the music, it's not an epic music but it's enjoyable You may quickly forget that there is music though.- Multiplayer-Tutorial ( some games forget about tutorials so it's a good point. I jumped right into the game but for novice players it is important ).- There are achievements will add some new objectives if you like that kind of things.- Very fast, the end turns are quick ( The End of All Wars ? )- There is a demo on the official website. Some people don't care but I find very important that games have a demo, only to see if it works on your computer.- Where are the objectives ? Only when you end you turn and that's a shame. It's either hidden very well and in that case it's a low point as well but I can't find a single button to see my objectives during my turn.What follows is neither a high nor a low point: The DLCs. They had several new campaign ( the base game with the German campaign and the multiplayer already offers a lotn enough to see if you like the game ) such as with the Afrika Corps, the allied or more focused scenarios such as the year 1940,...Etc I bought two of them and I am happy with them. DLCs don't take away anything from the base game they just had new campaigns for those who want more. Some may not like it but at least features were not taken from the base game to be sold after as DLCs like so many games do.So I highly recommand this, for old Panzer General and the like fans as well for novice in this genre. It's very intuitive and you will soon get into the game without headaches. During my first play, I find myself playing three hours in a row withou t noticing time passing. 8.5/10"

If you enjoy rolling over things with Nazi armor, you'll have a great time. If you'd like to play as the groups that crushed the Nazis like a bug, such as the Americans, Soviets or British, you'll be fighting an enemy with many times the number of overstatted Panthers, Tigers and King Tigers than you get Shermans or T34s or Cromwells. And they'll do it while flooding the skies with more planes than you've ever seen outside of the Bagration mission.Vastly more effort is spent on mission design and content for the Nazi campaigns. The Allied content is perfunctory at best.The actual combat has issues too. Combat stats as reported by the game are largely lies. Your results are essentially random and incredibly spikey. A battle where you are likely to get 7 kills and no losses can flip to you losing 7 strength and the enemy losing nothing. While this is fine in large scale -- and much better designed -- operational wargames like Decisive Campaigns : Barbarossa, in games where your force count is a couple dozen at the end of the game the fate of an entire campaign can hinge on whether or not RNG decides to stuff a broom up up your rear and wiggle it around. I had one missions where I lost three units fortified on hills to enemy infantry that in the previous turn I was predicted likely to beat on the attack. Why? Because RNG hates me.Order of Battle : WW2 is a much, much better game with much more predictable battles, a more complex game environment and a far better UI. It also doesn't descend into the unholy depths of Nazi tank wank like this game does."
