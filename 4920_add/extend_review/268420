,Recommended,268420,29597655,Posted: 30 January,all,Akihikko,"Gotta say, I've been grinding a lot on this game and find it pretty simple and easy to play. Just you have to do a lot of research on your own if you want to know how to do specific stuff, or you can learn it on your own in the hard way like any gamer. But I totally recommend this game for people that like anime and barely are starting to get into MMO's."
,Recommended,268420,30230896,Posted: 27 February,all,Avaritia,"I mean, if anime MMORPG are your thing you can't go wrong with Aura Kingdom.I played this game for a couple of months and I throughly enjoyed it, the questing never got boring even though it felt repetitive at times, the community is quite nice and willing to help, the art style is anime af, and overall it's really fun, but It  has several things that lacks.First of all, the combat. I'm not really a big fan of tab targeting but I'm not going to be biased and say the combat is bad just because it's not my style, I'm saying I don't like it because it isin't really imersive. You always will do the same combination of spell launch once you get all you spells and you won't change it unless some lvl 99 scrub says that he has a better spell chain. IMO Combat can use some improvement but it's not all bad, the game has a really interesting waif-- partner system. They're like summons which aid you in battle (some of which are women dressed in a well... anime style huehue). ALSO , you can equip two weapons, which is quite nice and quite (quite) original.Story is as you would expect from an anime MMORPG, personally I found the story OK at best, nothing I haven't seen in the other 86% of games.Characters/classes/beta males/waifus/whateveryouwanttocallthem Is something this game does nice, there's your typical guy (or loli) with the 10 ft Greatsword, your Legolas, your Aragon, you get it. But there are some few more classes that separate them from the rest of the MMORPGS that i've played in a while. As you would expect from a Asian rpg, you can customize the hell out of your character with all sorts of accesories (which some of them give boosts which I don't approve of tbh)Enjoyment, Even though I don't play AK anymore (i left because all my friends stop playing it FeelsBadMan) I really had fun playing it and I do recommend it if you enjoy anime style light hearted MMORPG with tab targeting combat... that being said I do wish they would improve a bit that combat, but overall solid game.I will give it a solid 7.5/10 on my IGNorance scale."

Meet real people of many races, cultures, nationalities and more! All players are welcoming and fun and many have a great sense of humor! I recommend for ages 9+ to be able to fully understand the game. As stated before, it is extremely fun and has that bit of challenge in it that keeps you interested all of the time. 9.5/10 I give it. Have Fun!Best Anime Game Out There!"
,Recommended,268420,29681322,Posted: 3 February,all,Barrfind V.,"Anime inspired 3D fantasy MMORPG where you, player, can form pacts with powerful spirits called Eidolons. Pet that helps you out in battle based on what he is supposed to do. World of Azuria is a bright and beautiful. Game that offers plenty of class and skill options. Playable classes with job advancements available at level 40 (Guardian, Duelist, Ravager, Wizard, Sorcerer, Bard, Grenadier, Gunslinger, Brawler, Ranger, Ronin, and Necromancer). Discover the world by completing hidden quests which can be particularly rewarding! Regular quests feature autopathing, but these special hidden quests do not, which makes them more rewarding. First couple days you go through the linear quests and doing what it tells you to do until you get to level 40, thats when most of the PVP, and Party Dungeons begin. Later on 60, you can get access to the Sky Tower. Most of the time in game you spend on grinding dungeons.I think that this game is targeted to casual MMO players, who just love the anime feeling and story."

(At least for Main Story missions.)- Extensive Class Choice- Simple Character modification (IE Hairstyle, eyes and colours.)Cons:- After level 30-40 it becomes a bit more of a grind to level up and obtain materials needed for legendary equipment.I really can't think of anything else..As you can see i'd highly recommend this to a friend or to somebody just wanting a casual MMORPG to relax and play."

And when I went to check my ""Forgot my pass"" on Aeria, I found out that my account was blocked. And I'm honestly very taken aback and very disappointed. I have no idea why my account was disabled, but it makes me extremely unhappy cause I've dedicated plenty of time into the game, and to have my progress lost just angers me tremendously.Currently, I'm about to restart the game and hopefully access my account again. If I can't I may resort to the new account I just created for myself. If there is an extra large update that caused my progress to be lost, it is reasonable. But if my account was blocked and removed for NO REASON? That's just it. HOWEVER, if I catch something that's interesting, I may stick around again. But we'll see. If I go through the same ordeal - I'm not gonna get struck by the same thing twice. -_-"

Great visuals, character customization is on fleek, the weapons and outfits really make you feel individual and the classes are really cool. I went with Ronin, myself, but i plan on starting up another one soon.Second of all, this game is especially great if you, like myself, aren't a huge fan of pvp. Aura Kingdom revolves around its plot and things related to it, which do not include pvp. If you're a fan of questing, dungeon crawling, and killing monsters for items, this game is fot you.

Yeah, it does have things in the shop that you can really only get from paying some money, but almost all of them are only cosmetic. You can play the entire main story without paying a penny. I haven't played enough PVP to tell you how it is in that aspect, but as for PVE you'll be just fine.-The game has a loyalty system, where you can only get certain items by using LP, which you can get fairly easily, even if your a casual player. (you get these points by loggin in daily and doing daily quests) I look at this as a positive because it encourages the player to just play the game, and not pay their way through.-The anime style is great. Enough saidCons:-The beginning of the game is very slow, especially storywise. Although this is a negative, please don't quite the game because of this reason. It picks up later fortunatly.-When it loads models, the game stutters. This could because my PC isn't the greatest ever so this could vary based on what your playing on.-Ill add more when I find someAs this is a MMO, this game could be ruined by the p2w route at any moment.

The only 2 things at this moment that i dont like is the left click to move thing and when you hold down your left mouse button to turn as you run the mouse it doesnt lock in place and disappear untill you let go and it pops up in the same spot. If the click to move was a option to toggle off and on that would be great and the cursor disappearing when you hold down right mouse button so that its not dragging accross the screen and accidently opens up something els b.c its at the other end of screen it would be a solid 9.5/10 or 10/10
