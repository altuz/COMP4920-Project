With that in mind, please continue.I'd like to mention something that has been gone over in other reviews. Yes, at the time, this game is not complete yet, and it has a ways to go. The official release branch has not been updated since February, and the devs were quiet for many months after that.However, the dev team has gotten their engine overhaul almost complete, and have begun an unstable alpha build that they've been releasing updates for on Steam quite regularly. With the updates that I'm sure will be soon added to the game, I'm confident this game will be worth the $20,but if you expect a mostly feature complete game, do not play this yet. Buy it, hold on to it, and play it once it's closer to release.I'll make sure to update this review once sufficient changes are made."

This is not simply playing a game, for now it is mainly just testing the game systems and giving feedback and reporting bugs. The main quest only recently got implemented because they ugraded to a newer version of CryEngine, which honestly has made the lighting effects and general graphics of the game much more beautiful than its earlier version.This game is Early Access.The game is challenging, enemies hit hard, you have to roll and block. Hacking-and-Slashing will get you dead. There are only 2 spells in the game currently, a heal spell and a light spell, however I believe the developers have said that spells will be receiving attention sometime within the next month.This game is Early Access.There are framerate problems and certain things still need to be balanced. Animations are meh. However, they update this game consistently every other week, in fact, its more common for them to provide an update of some sort EVERY week. This is a team of maybe 3 to 5 people and its clear that they are working hard.This game is Early Access.Please do not buy this game if you are going to clutter the forums with complaints about how its in an early state. Its advertised as being in an early state, it says Early Access in bright blue all over the reviews and the page. There are features that haven't been implemented yet, such as Co-op.Please DO buy this game if you want to support an indie developer in making a beautiful, third-person, open-world, Co-op RPG and you want to offer suggestions and feedback.TL;DR This game is Early Access."

It has a lot of potential and I enjoyed exploring and testing it out for a few hours. The graphics are great, the controller support appreciated, and the possibilities seemed endless. At this point, however, 3+ years after its release, I think everyone who paid for it should be refunded. We paid in good faith to support a developing game with the assurance that we'd eventually get a complete game. That is simply not the case here, unfortunately. 10/10 dashed hopes. 1/10 completeness."

The game drops you into a village and tells you to go do what you like.  So far there are no real quests, except ones that you make yourself.  The game's graphics are beautifully realistic, as only the Cry and Frostbite engines can offer, but not to taxing on your computers hardware, meaning my med-tier laptop can handle high settings and still maintain 40 fps.  Finally, the alpha state of the game means that anything can change and anything can be added.  Maybe the next update will include dragons.  Maybe trolls and dwarfs.  Or maybe even Tom Hanks.  Only time will tell, and I will be spending that time playing this game.EDIT1Due to some recent changes in the game my framerate has now dropped to a staggering 13 fps.  While this puts me off from enjoying the game I still am excited about the recent updates and I hope to see some optimization patches for the game so I may continue playing."

Don't get me wrong, it has a TON of potential. I can really see where the game could go...in a few years. Which is exactly the problem. It will take quite a long time for this game to really reach its potential. I say give it a year at least, maybe two and see how things are then.I know it's early access, but I didn't realize it was quite this early. I would almost not call this game in an alpha state just yet. It is more like a pre-alpha, behind closed doors only test phase in its current form. For me it was just too early access.The good:The enviornemtns look awesome. They are creative, varied and make you want to just explore around, since it's an open world you can definitely do just that.The combat has a decent start. It has a sort of Dark Souls vibe with how attacks work and change with each weapon you use.The spells seemed interesting and I liked that you could use two different stones to get various different spells for a decent level of customization.The bad (most if not all of these will probably be fixed at some point):No quest log. There are quests and the quest log is there, but the log is currently not working so it can be hard to remember what to do unless you write it down.No interactive map. It's basically just a still image. At least an indicator of my current location would be awesome.No voice acting. I don't want to totally put the game down for that. Obviously voice acting is a huge undertaking and maybe the game will eventually have it, maybe it wont. Just be aware that you will have to do a lot of reading here.No customizable controls. That wouldn't be so bad, but the hotkeys (in my  opinion) are very strangely set up.No controller support (yet). I don't know if controller support is planned but this game really would feel a lot better with a controller in my opinion.The game doesn't save your position. When you quit or the game crashes or whatever, you start back in the hut you started the game in. You do keep all your items though, so I found it kind of strange that it doesn't save your position when you quit.The game crashes fairly often. I had two crashes in about an hour.Enemies are a bit easy. While I said it did have a Dark Souls vibe, the AI is a bit weak. The first several enemies I ran in to just walk at you and attack. If you time it right you can use this huge greatsword I found and one shot the enemy before it even gets one attack off. This changed a tiny bit when I ran in to a few shield enemies but it still wasn't that challenging.There are several areas you will explore just to find nothing there. I went in to a cave with some skeletons, worked my way to the back and found...a wall with a crack in it that looked like it had something behind it but I couldn't break it no matter what I tried. So then I found another path in to the same cave but at a different area. That path had no enemies and led straight to a dead end with nothing in it. So I turned back around, found yet another cave, walked through it, killed an enemy or two, swam in some water, and found a way out. It led to this high narrow bridge like thing. I followed that all the way to the end and...nothing, the bridge just suddenly stops at a massive drop off."

,Recommended,268670,14961827,"Posted: 19 March, 2015",all,Chashmodai,"I feel like I've played long enough to give a fair review now. So, here's my thoughts.First of all: The environment. The mountain, towering up from the earth, and the temple on top. The bridge, spanning from said mountain to the archives on the other side - and of course, the newly added Archive itself. It's just stunning to look at. I've been staring at the environment far longer than I usually do in games. I hope to see many locations as beautiful as this with future patches.The graphics are superb, too. Nothing to complain about there. The sounds are a bit generic, but as far as I know, devs are implementing sounds as the development progresses. The sounds will surely be better once the game is released.What about gameplay? The combat is.. well. It's hard. It's fun and tactical, but it's hard. But then, I usually suck at combat in these types of games unfortunately. A suggestion: difficulty slider.I have only tried magic on occasion, and never in fact tried fighting using it. There's an illumination spell which I fairly often use, and the magic system is pretty interesting. Instead of mana, you have something called Ikhor. Pile up enough of it, and you die. You gain Ikhor by using spells. It's like mana in most games - but instead of just running out of mana, you'd die. You also collect shards, which contain certain spells. There are equipped on your arms/gloves and makes you able to use said spells. Quite an interesting concept, and it works too.As it is right now, you just resurrect at nearest bed/camp when you die. You don't lose anything(as far as I know), and that's just good for me, since I die like 10 times everytime I play the game.Overall, I think this game is worth the 19 euro they ask for it. I won't give a score at this time since it's so early in development. I do recommend it if you like games like Skyrim, ie open-world RPGs.Sorry if this review is muddy or something, I've been awake far too long. It should, though, get most of my points through."

Also, despite it being listed as single-player, the devs have indicated in the forums that they are going to implement co-op (isn't a co-op rpg skyrim/dark souls experience what everyone wants?). This is an extremely early access game. There isn't a lot to do in it right now. However, the concept behind it is genius. Go check out the forums. The devs seem to be listening to their community. I recommend this game despite it's incomplete status because of its concept. I see a few reviews saying things of the sort ""I don't recommend it right now."" However, we need people to support this game so that it can achieve its potential. If your looking for a completed game, then this isn't it (hence early access). But if your looking to back something of the sort I've described, then give it a shot. I could see this game, easily going for $60 at full release. I know a lot of people have been burned on ""early release titles"" lately. This is one that I'm willing to risk it for."

I do support their effort and encourage financially supporting the title.  The skill progression based system where even stamina is increased upon running is akin to morrowind/ultima online.  There are a few exploitable NPCs right now that give amazing gear immediately upon login.  I've found one boulder throwing boss in a cave that was tough for a bit.  Lots to explore.

I do not recommend this game to someone looking for an immediate solid gaming experience, I do however recommend that you invest in this game if you like the concept of and open-world action rpg, that is reminiscent of Dark Souls. Something worth mentioning is that I feel as if the game is hard not 'Dark Souls hard' but this game is unfair, the combat is not fluid and responsive enough to allow you to play the game with the required amount of skill.

Don\'t get me wrong this game is far from finished, but if you don't mind only being able to explore a beautifuly crafted island without much gameplay features, and helping the devs finance this amazing project then your not going to be disapointed. This is so far the most beautiful well crafted Place that I have seen, and  I don't mind spending  an hour or so every couple of days wandering around and exploring.Edit: Seems all work on this game has stopped and been abandoned.

Character creation is nice but give me something to DO.In my hour of gametime I did some flailing around, killed some random wandering knights. Most of my deaths, or rather, ""Reloads"" is when I fell into water and could not find a way out at all. Kudos for not giving me instant water death like older games, but kudos immediately lost when I spent ten minutes swimming around trying to find ANY kind of surface to get back on land.I keep checking back up with this game only to find that they haven't updated in more than a year.

The controls are a bit clunky as well. I liked my time with it, then I got stuck after falling off a ledge, so guess I'll end my current playtime here until the game gets more updates.The RPG systems seem to be in their infancy, only gear and a neat magic system seem to be available at the moment. The quests a bit meh, the writing could definitely be more concise and precise in what the characters want you to do instead of just implying it. Also greatswords sell for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so pick them up whenever possible. Also the only town that seems to have had much thought put into it is the first one, the one I found beyond the stone bridge was basically just houses and squashes and that's about it.Wouldn't buy at this point in time, it's not worth the money, imo. However maybe 6 months or a year down the line I think this game could really be something to see. It has a hell of a lot of potential, and I just hope the devs don't squander this potential.
