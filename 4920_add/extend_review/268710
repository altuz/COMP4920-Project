There are a few interviews that are worth listening to, but then you could just go on Youtube and find similar content. I feel like an idiot for spending money on what I thought would be a fleshed out and content rich documentary experience. In its defence you may find the this a good introduction to stereoscopic spherical cinema and the film does attempt to use 3d assets in a traditional VR setting."

This should be offered as nothing more than a tech demo, shown at shows to gather interest for VR. To sell it at a premium for people hungry for all things VR is a complete sham. There wasn't much I enjoyed but the Buffalo were brilliant. Other than that, pretty poor."

Not worth $15 (or even $12) considering some great free demos available, but it does show what is possible beyond gaming."

The demo is much better suited to introduce someone first time to VR than the actual product is--much better.Who  decided to put a war simulation as ione of the first scenes? For most people this is disturbing and not a good start into VR.And why is there to way to jump to the next scene? That is probably the most annoying part of it, you cannot fastforward or skip a scene.So, this program is quite a disappointent after all. I did not expect a VR movie or anything, just a nice introduction into the possibilities of VR films.Stick with the demo, it is better suited for that unfortunately."

But that's cool too, because I'm interested. And I like documentries... where people talk and talk and talk .... and then something happens that's minutely interesting .... and then more talking. Kinda distracts the awesomeness of the visuals. I wish there was a directors cut where they cut out all the voiceovers.When it comes to VR, I really don't care about what life would be like 20 years from now... I'd rather immerse myself in the virtual reality of *now*.... without someone breathing down my neck about 2035 and whether it will fit in with our post-real neo-simplistic social cloud-based pseudo lives that we are already living in.What gets me ""steamed"" is that fact that once you buy the movie, you can no longer play the demo version. And when I want to ""show off"" to my real life friends and show them Zero Point... I have to sit and wait for the whole thing to play out... I'd rather just show them the 2 minute demo (Which has all the goods part BTW), and then ""show off"" some other cool aspect of VR that are on steam.Even at sale price, the demo is better. I wish I could ""Un-Buy""... oh hum. This would be better served to us plebs as a rental."

Not the end of the world, but still, having to do that is unecessary.So - devs, update this asap to 0.7 or later.This is not a game (as one could have guessed), it is more of a documentary / tech demo to show what is possible with 360' VR video. The video isnt of the highest resoultion and fast head movement makes the video a bit fuzzy, but clears up once your head pans around slowly again. The military scenes shows an unadjusted video line and while that is a small detail, it still breaks immersion - something that video producers of the future have to think about.My favourite scene was when the camera was walking around, you could really get a sense of presense. I actually started to giggle when i saw the bison walk up to ""me"" and put its nose in my face.Is it worth it? Well, if you can spare a minute to uninstall the latest version of  the oculus Runtime and downgrade to version 0.4.4, you have something cool to show your friends and family. While this is just a techdemo, it is still a nice experience worth €4, and the sense of presens is way better than any IMAX movie which costs about the same. But this one is in your own home.Just dont forget to upgrade your Oculus runtime drivers after you are done."

When the 3D video is solid, the 360 degree experience is lacking, and when there's a great 360 video, the 3D is barely there.If this ever gets discounted to <$5 I'd consider reccomending it, but at the current price, it's very skippable.Edit: edit"
,Recommended,268710,12675104,"Posted: 28 October, 2014",all,MattManCollins,"Know what you are buying before actually buying it.It's important to see this short film more as a tech demo to show what film in VR can be capable of.It's a short, roughly 20 minute or so documentary that really just serves to show a lot of neat different scenarios captured on film to immerse you into the experience.The film is primarily just some guys in the industry talking about how big VR can become and its incredible possibilities while several different scenarios and scenes are gone through during the short running time. There isn't really any connection at all to the different scenes you are put into throughout the documentary, however if that doesn't bother you then enjoy the ride! If anything, their random nature is to help prove the point that the guys are saying about how many endless possibilites there are for VR to have.Some scenes stand out more than others, and honestly some of them can be truly fascinating. One scene in particular made me feel incredibly present in the setting, and really pretty uncomfortable (in a good way, haha!).All-in-all, if you're going to buy it then just make sure to know beforehand that this is more like a tech demo for what film in VR can be, and that this ultimately proves that there is a very bright and exciting future ahead for that. If you go into this with that knowledge I really believe you'll find this to be a great, enjoyable, and fascinating experience. There is some really great material in this short film, and even with its slightly pricey tag, I'd recommend it to VR users looking for a really neat and new experience."

Horribly blurry for 90% of the entire 15 minutes.    I've seen plenty of 360 3D free amateur demos with 100 times better quality.  I would never play this to show off the Oculus to anyone.

You dont need to buy the ""Movie"". And hey, i mean 15 Minutes  for 11 €? Thats Cuánto dinero. Would be ok if the Movie would have some special scenes with a ""WOW"" effect. Just my meaning."

I can't even imagine how they managed to pull off the stereoscopic 3D 360 degree video. It ran perfectly smoothly with absolutely no judder on my machine, and I found myself repeatedly saying, ""Wow,"" or ""This is amazing,"" throughout the entire experience. This opens your mind to so many future applications of virtual reality filmmaking. A couple of small stitching problems in a scene or two keep it from being perfect, but it's the best use of video on the Oculus Rift that I've seen so far. Outstanding."

I bought in only because I want to support early efforts to get VR ""film"" rolling :)  There are some pretty amazing ""shots"" in here that are worth taking a look at though.  Particularaly the scene with the Buffalo at sunset, and the crowd scene.  Some things to keep in mind are that the DK2 is not very good at video due to the pixel structure and resolution.  Also, I feel that the head tracking is very limited in comparison to a full 75hz game like Proton Pulse.  I'm not sure if its a limitation of their tech or my system (GTX780 SLI), but the framerate is very choppy while moving your head.  I believe this is probably due to the framerate of most of their video not matching the 75 hz of the rift, so as you turn your head you are seeing 1 frame of video dragged across up to 3 frames of rift screen refreshes (for 24 hz video)?  This issue certainly needs to be addressed if they plan on releasing comercial VR ""films.""  Also, I'd suggest a disclaimer recommending that you don't move your head side to side or back and forth while watching, as positional tracking is impossible to support with this tech, and VR sickness is quite nasty."

The theater experience was very cool. The bison scene was very cool. A good look at different VR filming techniques.CONS: Some scenes were noticeably blurry. Audio was out of sync quite a bit. Not much content really. For most of it, the video had nothing to do with the audio commentary. A bit expensive for 15 minutes (but show it to 11 other people and that cuts it down to $1 each!).OVERALL: Not as good as it could've been, but still, it was an interesting and worthwhile experience IMO.

,Recommended,268710,12672248,"Posted: 28 October, 2014",all,Whirlspell,"An excellent showcase for first-gen VR filmmaking. I had the DK2 in extended mode, with my solo monitor set as primary, launched Zero Day from Steam (not in VR mode) and it just worked, perfectly. The short film (~15min) is sort of a compilation of various demo footage, most in 360* 60fps, all of it in stereoscopic 3D. Some of the footage is better than others, and around a third of the footage is either 180* or normal footage projected onto a curved display. The opening and closing segments feature a fully rendered cinema where you are transported to and from your seat, through the IMAX-like screen, and into space. Yes, it's awesome. With the latest Oculus runtime and firmware installed, I noticed very little judder, but some judder and screen tearing is normal during the 360* footage, due to the work-in-progress nature of the techniques used to stitch together so many camera views.I'm all for supporting premium VR content at this stage, since it will allow developers and filmmakers to developed new tools and processes to keep pushing things further. The price may seem hefty for a short film, but this is good stuff, and a lot of resources went into putting it together. It's also by FAR the easiest way to showcase a number of great things VR can be used for. From epic nature footage to sightseeing, a wedding, and a shape ship, there's something that would appeal to anyone who you might want to demo a Rift to."

Performance issues galor in this thing. After reading multiple reviews about this not working properly I thought to myself Ill download the demo to see if it ran ok on my setup. To my surprise the demo works flawlessly on my setup. So I bought it. Actual game runs terribly after space scene. Even the same scenes that worked good in the demo ran horrendous in full version. Then it stoped at the run down building scene near the end. I love how they made the demo work great but the full version blows. Zero point did a full bait and  switch on me. I don't understand how prerecorded video scenes can be this hard to do. Wish i could get a refund for this garbage.Don't buy it!!!!! No matter how tempted you are.
