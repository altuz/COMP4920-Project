,Recommended,268750,10434456,"Posted: 11 June, 2014",all,Ƶεrø 零 Knight,"This is probably the most fun I've had in an early access game so far to date. As of the time of this writing, the game is still in Early Access, but there is a seemingly endless land for you to (attempt) to fight through as far as you possibly can, all the while gathering raw materials and crafting them (simple 1 & 1 combinations; think Resident Evil) into tools, weapons, armor, potions and more.This is a roguelike, so if you get frustrated by dying a lot (and you will) and losing all of your progress in the blink of an eye (which will happen), this game may not be for you. Those who do enjoy roguelikes need no further explanation :) When starting, you create your character and have many unlockable hats, races and their variants to choose from. Don't worry, the hats actually do give your character unique abilities :P On top of this, the game also makes use of a ""trait system"" that gives each player two randomized traits (which you can re-roll) that do things like raise ATK, but lower DEF, cut down trees faster, brew stronger potions, increase DEX, etc.If you make it to the end of an area, you will see 3 doors of varying color (which indicate the area type), each taking you to the next area's village where you can sell treasure, buy weapons, smelt ores, refine pelts and hides into leather for armor, and generally terrorize the locals and their chickens. Once you're geared up, you'll leave the village and repeat the process of trying to get to the end once again, only with harder enemies ;)Enough about the baseline details though...let's talk about actual gameplay! Generally speaking, you have the movement skills of a friggin' ninja; you can dash side to side, double jump, and even dash midair (several times if you have the stamina)! Mastering movement is one of the first keys to survival in Magicite; if you can't be hit, then you can't be killed (as easily). Other than your ninja-like abilities, every 5th level (I believe is the increment...don't quote me) you can choose a new skill from 3 paths to unlock and use to further aide in your adventure. These can be anything from a giant sword that shoots underneath you and propels you into the air (allowing for a triple jump, or even a quadruple jump if you have a special item), a fireball that you can shoot arrows at to make flaming arrows, berserker rage, to a protective aura that reduces all damage taken for everyone in your party.At risk of spoiling more potential fun and shenanigans in figuring the various aspects of the game out just by playing (like me and my friends did), I'm going to end here. Pick up the game! Seriously, this is one of the most fun Early Access games out there, you will not be disappointed!"

,Recommended,268750,9088677,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Michael Wilson,"Warning: The following was composed while the game was released inEarly Access Build 0.7.2.[2014/02/13]Please understand that the game is still in development and when the game is updated the information in this review may be obsolete. When the development surpasses Early Access Build 0.7.2 you may be able to use this review to compare how the game has changed over development.IntroductionRogue-like games are normally games which offer some form of level randomization or procedural generator and permanent death; your character dies and you must either start over or keep going until everything is lost. These types of games are normally unforgiving. With Magicite this concept is taken to its very sadistic core.Side-scrolling games are normally progressed by moving on the screen to the right or left to reach the end of the stage or meet some type of goal. Goals like ‘saving a princess’ from the big bad, but she happens to be in another castle. These games normally follow some type of gimmick, like the stage progresses on its own, timed, forcing you to advance.Also with a Rogue-like game the graphics are not normally the main focus, thus if you are turned off by anything below 3D graphics you should consider something else.Please note, this is /not/ a sandbox construction game due to just having crafting, you currently do not 'build' anything. If that is what your looking for, you are truely in the wrong castle.This will be a breakdown of concept and features, atmosphere and stability.Concept / FeaturesThis is a 2D Side scrolling Rouge-like with item crafting.Right now the game has currency which is dropped when monsters are killed along with experience points. Currency can be used to buy random items from towns, which are in between levels.You create a character and can keep re-rolling stats with two perks before starting, after that you thrust into generated levels with death. Personally I kept generating until I has a perk which allows me to open chests without keys and kept raiding the dungeon stage due to high chest generation.It has crafting related to inventory management; making weapons, armor and items. Beyond that this is not a sandbox and you do not build anything. Towns appear in between levels. If you stay on a level to long, well you’re going meet death.The interface is rather clean and easy to use after you have it down, however it can be somewhat frustrating at the start due to it just throws the player into the mix without hints.Many functions are not implemented currently, like a crafting recipe log. However I’m sure they soon will be.When you reach level five, ten and 15 you are able to pick a level up spell/benefit which is accessed by using 1, 2 and 3 respectively from the keyboard.In order to make armors you are going to need to collect ore and smelt it while in a town. You will need three of the same ingots to make the armor.Multiplayer is a blast, however you must watch what you do and share resources otherwise, being doomed to fail comes to mind.AtmosphereQuick and to the point, much is not needed beyond the objective.The art is decent and fits. The music is a mixed bag, the tracks are rather decent however I found myself wanted something more fasted paced. For some odd reason I pictured more of a old style arcade type feel for music, something like those action based games like funky fighter.StabilityThere are in game bugs related to items and crafting.Overall the game had very slight hangs, they where not consistent, not a major problem. It also /did not/ crash on older machines I tested with. I tried on older desktop machines and laptops under windows Vista and Windows 7; it was decent and was not a complete resource hog allowing me to multitask by pausing with ESC.I also did not run into any critical errors which cased instability and the program failed to run.While I’m unable to speak for everyone and their systems it seems to be overall pretty solid. Most of the time games in alpha or beta still are unstable while this game seems to be nicely polished in respect to stability in the listed windows environments.Multiplayer was decent, there is much talk about friendly fire, currently this feature feels like it hits home, and with the fact that this game is sadistic. While I do not think that Magicite should 'force' players to have to deal spacing of teammates and friendly fire, I feel that it should be and on and off switch for the host. While friendly damage is on there should be higher rewards or benefits beyond being up to the challenge.ConclusionIf you like Rogue-like games, I would currently recommend this. If you do not like Rogue-likes I would not recommend this, since this game is truly sadistic at its core. If you happen to be the supreme overlord of your minions, *ahem* friends and are willing to subjugate them to wallow in punishment and death, the more the merrier.Gameplay suggestions:http://steamcommunity.com/app/268750/discussions/0/540733523379927400/Edit History2015/12/09: Formating."

If the developers had worked out bug fixes and added just a few more features (i.e. it would be great to be able to save a run after a level so you're not committed to doing it all in one sitting) after release I would recommend this highly, but in its current state I would only buy it on sale.Pros:-fun mix between platformer and roguelike-reasonable difficulty (neither too easy nor too hard)-quite nice looking-the class system is pretty interesting and, despite being simple, adds variety and increases replayabilityCons:-feels like an early access game despite being finished w.r.t. occasional bugs, content feeling skimpy/unpolished-no saving mid-run so if you didn't budget enough time to finish up on a run that goes long, you've wasted your timeWorth $10?  IMO no.  Worth <$5 on steam sale?  Absolutely."
,Not Recommended,268750,17353655,"Posted: 2 August, 2015",all,London,"Magicite has a great concept and decent execution, however it is held back by bad game design choices which limit it's replaybility and fun.The game is a rogue-lite and utilizes semi-randomly created  platform levels, the point of each level is to get to the end of the stage. There's 20 stages in each run and between each run there's a mini-hub town that serves as a resting point. Prior to each run you create a character by picking a race, items and pets once unlocked.Each stage has 1 passive animal and about 2-3 enemy types, which gets quite repetitive very quickly.My main issues with the game are:- No save method in between runs, once you start you are locked in and games usually take me 45-55 minutes to complete. You have to commit to this game, as quitting halfway through will result in nothing.- Characters, hats, and pets (each with their own distinct bonuses) are randomly unlocked (ie. 20% to unlock a new character once game is complete).  This forces multiple artificial playthroughs in the hopes of an unlock, and since you're playing with the same characters with limited choices on similar levels versus the same enemies, it's not fun- Combat is quite bland, there's 4 or so weapon types (1 handed swords, two handed swords, staffs, and a bow) and any differences are purely cosmetic/stat wise. You choose 3 magic skills when leveling up and most of them are not fun or useful.- The game handles healing in an odd way, forcing the player to eat food every couple of minutes for a 50% chance to heal 1 HP point or take a rare and hard to find healing potion (for 2 HP or 5 HP if you farm two potions). Most enemies will do about 4-8 damage per hit.- There is basic item crafting, yet the crafting menu is atrocious and with a severely limited storage space you'll find yourself running out of room quite quickly- The game has a weird love affair with random number generators- upon leveling you MAY or MAY NOT gain any stat points and again - not a fun game design choice.Overall, the game is limited by it's love for RNG and poor game design choices. There's very little depth to the game and an artificial barrier of difficulty as you hope to get a lucky roll when leveling or unlocking new items. Nothing carries over between saves or playthroughs, aside from characters/hats/pets which may or may never unlock after multiple hours.Would not recommend unless it was wicked on sale."

Everything is balanced perfectly.When somebody mines an ore node, an ore drops for every player. If you have one dedicated miner/crafter then everybody becomes relatively kitted out in a reasonable amount of time. Yes, RNGesus can come in and declare you unworthy of the correct ore nodes, and when it happens it sucks, but it's rare enough that it doesn't ruin anything.The controls are tight, very tight. When you glub up, you know it's because YOU glubbed up. The only thing I wish is that I could rebind things a little more. Like having the dash be a double-tap instead of hitting E and Q. It feels strange to me personally, maybe it works for you though.You will die, and you will die a lot. You'll keep coming back though. Grab a few friends and let the good times roll."

You will play it about a half hour and then say: why the hell did I buy this game? Then, about a week later, you will come back just to see if it really was that bad. You will start playing it, start to discover the game mechanics and the crafting system. Then you will continue playing it and eventually get addicted to it. Then your character will die. And you'll probably rage quit. But you'll come back the next day.I mean, this game is awesome. For $10, you get a really nice product. You can even play multiplayer (wich I didn't try yet). I just love the way the game drops you inside the first biome and tells you nothing, almost laughing at you, it's kind of funny, but it makes discovering crafting recipes so much rewarding. The game is also very colorful, each biome having it's own main color. The perma-death system could look very frustrating at first (and it really is), but it adds a little bit more challenge to the game, wich pleases me, because it makes the game even more rewarding. The combat system is also really well done, because it takes skills not to get brutally murdered by every single creature you encounter. I can't wait for the next updates to add even more nice stuff to the game!I would give this game a solid 9/10If you like platformers, you should definetly buy this game!"

I absolutely love it! 9/10More Details:+Nice artstyle & lighting.Super cool and fitting music.Not too easy.Many different weapons (Swords, Zweihanders, Great Axes, etc.) There's even a Sword made out of Jelly!Unique crafting system. Never seen that before.Cool and fun way to progress: Either you farm yourself up to diamonite or you may be lucky and you can purchase a  diamonite pickaxe at the town. (Collecting and selling a lot of wood is a great way to farm gold. But it recently got nerfed. But in my opinion it's still worth it!)Challenging enemies with a pretty good AI.You can unlock hats, companions, races and different variants for them (haircuts). Hats are really useful. I strongly recommend the Miner Cap.There are a lot of skills available. For example ""Potion Brewer"". With this skill, you have a 50% chance of crafting a big potion instead of a small potion.Many randomly generated dungeons. After each dungeon, you will visit a town where you can smelt ores, sell some items and make yourself some armor.You can play as a mage, a ranger or a warrior. Of course you can combine those if you want.-Crafting: It's really hard to figure out every recipe on your own. Maybe a recipe book for all the basic stuff would be a good thing to implement.Inventory: Your inventory gets full way too fast. Maybe adding a way to craft backpacks would be nice.Items disappear after a couple of seconds.That's all I can complain about. So to sum it up, I think this game is super addictive and fun. In my opinion, the game is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. After 4.5hrs of total play time I almost(!) beat the game 2 times now. I died at the last boss. I won't spoil it, but the boss reminds me a lot of Terraria. :DI strongly recommend you to buy this game. You'll support awesome game developers AND get a super cool game!"
,Not Recommended,268750,13771030,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,Notesurfer,"Beneath Magicite's colorful rogue-lite veneer lies a surprisingly grindy platformer. Random stat gains and % effect items are exceedingly, almost excessively balanced - it's very rare to find yourself too low on any one stat, or for an item to fail to activate within the desired margin of error. This is not a flaw in and of itself, but coupled with the repetitive level generation, playing through Magicite quickly becomes a stale experience. The crafting system is quite shallow, and biomes contain virtually-identical enemies varying only in stats and artistic style. The races, abilities, hats, and companions all add some replayability, but since there are only three viable playstyle archetypes, these diminish in relevance, as advanced strategic combinations are not possible.Magicite has the depth and simplicity of a mobile game, but with the time commitment of a much more robust game. A few hours of enjoyment may be had, but this is not a game that will tantalize you with additional progression for long."

Why do I recommend it, then?When played cooperatively, this game can be good fun. This holds provided that you manage to play, that is. With the help of the Hamachi software I am being able to play with a friend (but whenever we tried to play with 3 players we failed, and some other friends are unable to make the game work for some reasons).It's a roguelike: you create a random character, you progress from one biome to another killing monsters, gathering resources, and crafting objects, and you unlock stuff in the process (new races, new abilities...). It's fun, once you understand what you need to do (like increasing your Dex to use ranged weapones, crafting objects to use magic...). And it's incredibly difficult to finish!

The game is lots more fun if you play with friends, but to play multiplayer you have to set up some third party software to even begin to play. (Each person playing has to do it too.) The game could easily  be a lot better even if all the developer did was fix the bugs. As of now you can't even beat the final boss without the game crashing when you kill it.

,Not Recommended,268750,33018101,Posted: 29 June,all,Pruitts5,"Mufin Mcflufin said exactly what we were all thinking... This game used to be a lot of fun. It was an interesting take on Rogue-like with various other recently trending aspects of games incorporated into it (procedural generation, crafting, and all-in-all mimicing the Minecraft aesthetic) while still keeping the core gameplay engaging without loading it down with unnecessary aspects. All-in-all, this was a great game that rightly deserved every dollar put towards it. Note this paragraph is all past-tense.The final update to this game has ruined the entire game, made it in many senses unplayable (especially compared to the ways that players used to be encouraged to play it before), and has tainted my personal view of the developers themselves. The developers have abandoned this game in favor of making a new game, Roguelands, which is a side-scrolling Rogue-like with procedurally generated maps, with crafting, towns, bosses, weapons, classes, upgrades, unlockables, and many more things. If this seems a bit familiar, it's because Roguelands is almost a carbon copy of Magicite. The developers have (by all appearances) intentionally broken Magicite in favor of rebuilding the game and charging all the old players to play the same game again.I won't list all the bugs the final update of this game adds (I don't have enough space nor time to do so), but there are plenty of old fansites that list the very numerous bugs that now make the game unplayable. To name just a few for examples, one death in multiplayer games now fails the entire run (players used to respawn at the beginning of each new level), cooking raw chicken locks up your game, many unlockable items fail to ever drop despite perfectly meeting the criteria for them to drop, interacting with some NPCs can cause all shops in the game to permanently shut down, and the game is literally unbeatable now. The game will freeze then crash on the victory screen, causing you to lose all progress made.Some of these can be dismissed as bugs that were simply not noticed in development of the final update, but far too many of these bugs (and all the many other bugs all reported on old fansites) are bugs that would be almost impossible to not notice in testing the update, leading me to believe that the developers of this game intentionally put many of these bugs in to destroy all playability of their old game so they could focus efforts on making their new game that is almost exactly the same thing that Magicite used to be.I would recomment this game 1 or 2 years ago, but as the game stands now, I would not recommend it or anything these developers will ever release"

If you think it looks like a really cool concept that's great, go on over to the Roguelands steam page and buy that game instead. It costs the exact same as this one and is far more developed. This game, on the otherhand, has been completely abandoned (so they could work on Roguelands might I add) and, although I don't respect the company for doing so, Roguelands is definatly fun and I would recommend it. If you do buy Roguelands though, make sure you have some friends to play with since, although not absolutely necessary, it makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.EDIT: The company who made this game may or may have not broken Magicite intentionally to force people to buy Roguelands (maybe, not really sure).

I simply can't ignore them.Issue 1: Lack of instructionsBesides the 'tip' on your inventory screen, the game doesn't really tell you much about what will create what. Wood + Wood = Wood plank. Wood plank + Stick = Sword hilt. Wood Plank + Wood Plank = Wooden Blade. Wooden Blade + Sword Hilt = Sword. Do you see how many steps it takes to get to a sword? The same things won't make a axe or a pick either. You have to add two sticks together to make an axe hilt. Three sticks to make a pick hilt too. The game tells you nothing of the sort so it's mostly guess work. Minecraft is the same but it's easier to guess in that game than it is in this one. (3 wood across and 2 sticks down looks like a pick before it even makes it for example). I don't want to have to keep minimising the game just to look at a crafting page. An optional tutorial in the main menu wouldn't hurt anyone.Issue 2: The spawns9 times out of 10, I will spawn right in front of a bunch of items like they're guarding the trees I need to make a sword so I end up having to fight them with my lone little axe. Several times I spawned in front of two boars so they just charged me down and killed me right away. This issue isn't too big but it can be annoying when it leads to quick deaths before you're even able to put up a good fight.Issue 3: The..randomness.Hear me out with this one. I understand that the game is about randomly generated dungeons. This I have no problems with. I'm all off every playthrough taking me through a different layout and different enemies. The thing I have a problem with is something that actually happened during my playthrough right before this review as well as (about) my fifth attempt at the game. I was in the 5th district and very low on health. (Guess I suck at the game :P) I had a herb in my inventory which, when combined with another herb, would make a healing potion. Where do you get another herb? In tuffles of grass around the area. Seems simple to just avoid enemies until I find another grass pile, right? Wrong. I encountered several grass piles but they can't paying out in mushrooms (Two of them make a mana potion) or spider webs of all things. I kept trying and trying but it would not give me a herb nor would anything else give me a herb. Even the shop before the area didn't have any potions. I was managing to kill the jumping spiders even when backed into a corner when all of a sudden, some big bug boss monster thing that took up a big chunk of the screen flew in and killed me immediately. The same thing happened during my fifth try at the game. I was standing still and trying to craft some stuff when a floating head came down and dealt 9999 damage to my 8 hp guy. Dead. It's like if Mom suddenly started attacking you in one of the thing rooms of Binding of Isaac. It's just ridiculous.Issue 4: The cursor camera.So while you play this game, your mouse cursor is turned into a cross hair symbol and it controls which direction you're looking as well as moving the camera. If you move it to the edge of the screen, the screen will move in that direction so as to kinda let you see what's ahead before you go over there. I like it. It comes in handy for seeing future enemies and if you've missed any materials. But where I feel the issue leaves is that it does both of those things. So if you fling the cursor to one side quickly because you just noticed an enemy is coming, the screen will move away so you can't see anything. It'll be very quick too so it gets disorienting and by the time you have it back on you and the enemy, you've needlessly lost hp or died. A simple option to be able to tweak its speed would fix this quite easily.Issue 5: The inventory.Remember when I told you at the first issue how to make a sword? Well that as well as all crafting has to be done inside your own inventory screen. So you have to work around all the other objects you're carrying and when you don't have two squares open (To put a lone wood plank into both in order to create a Wood blade for example) then you're going to have to drop some stuff then pick it back up when you're done. It's not that big of a deal at first but when you're doing it every time you stop to craft, it can be. A sub box next to your inventory could solve this pretty easily. Like a big grid right next to your inventory since your quick selection boxs, armor, extra pieces and inventory take up about 15% of the sreen.And those are my issues with the game after about 2 hours of play. Other than that, the art style of the game is very appealing to look at. The music can be nice to listen to. It's pretty fun to fight the enemies (when super op boss monsters don't float down out of nowhere to instant kill you)If you've played Minecraft or Terraria then don't bother getting this game. It's basically the same thin as both of those except when you eat, you leave a poop on the spot where you ate. If you feel that's worth £7 (or whatever it is your currency) then go for it.In the end, I have to say I do not recommend it to people that aren't interested in this type of game or the issues I mentioned seem like they would get to you. It's an alright little game but doesn't stand out enough to warrant the payment."

Although you begin your journey with just a generic playable character armed with an axe and a few random items, after harvesting enough wood, stone and precious metal to craft more advanced tools and weaponry to better slay a variety of enemies, you will quickly unlock more playable characters, pets and hats with different traits, and you will be inclined to try the whole journey again. The game is fun and plays well as it is, and the new contents/improvements constantly being added definitely makes it a value-buy in the long run.Gameplay:You will move, dash, jump and double-jump to get you across from the entrance on the left to an exit located to the  right, stopping briefly to chop down trees for wood, mine some stones/ores and to harvest herbs and mushrooms. You will encounter slimes, boars, skeletons, spiders and many other type of enemies, and you may choose to engage them with well-timed slashes of your item in hand (i.e not necessarily a proper weapon), snipe with your bow and arrow or simply introduce them to one or all three types of elemental magic attacks should you desire. Gain experience to level up for better stats and special skills to aid you in slaying the final boss at the end, but with permanent death, it is likely that it will take you more than a couple of tries with one of many unlockable characters before you succeed. Get friends to play together and it will be even more enjoyable, depending on who survives better.Aesthetics:Numerous examples have shown that pixel-art graphics can be part of a successful product, and Magicite have no problems being one such product. The colour palettes used varies according to the biomes, but are generally colourful and goes well with the background tunes of the respective biomes.Final word:Highly recommended for the gameplay as a platformer, as well as replay value for the almost constant streams of new contents from the developer."

Then the problem appears :Cons- The unlockables are generately random, for example :""Defeat Boss X and have 20% chance to unlocked this maybe awesome guy""getting to the Boss level and defeat him is already hard enough for a rogue-like game, adding the % chance just made us think it's a waste of time mastering the game itself.- Stats Upgrade also random, yes it makes every run is different and unique, but it also make every ""bad luck stat"" is annoying.- Item combination is a tough one, there's no recipe information whatsoever, maybe you can get along with some of the item combination after 20-30 runs. And there's no different window for combining, it's in your inventory, drag and drop to another item to combine, accident click are common.- Inventory is a mess, it's hard to slice up items if you need some. Left-click to hold the item, Right-click to divide it in half, what if I have 40 woods and I only need 2? You guess it, 40:2 = 20, 20:2 = 10, 10:2=5, somehow odd number like 5 get you 3&2, look how much inventory space I needed?.ProsOverall, the game are very challangeing and somewhat fun to play because of curiosity to unlock new things.

,Recommended,268750,12436745,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,Polarity,"I really recommend Magicite as it is unbelievably fun, even if it doesn't look it. I know that I started playing thinking ""Am I going to enjoy this?"", but I played for a bit and realised that this game is great - especially with a friend or two to play with.The crafting is, meh, but I couldn't care less about that. It's a crafting system. They weren't exactly going to add a 3x3 grid and clutter the screen up aswell as making it similar to a certain other game. I've seen a lot of reviews that just talk about the crafting system, but that's just imbecilic: it's not the main point of the game.Magicite is replayable, over, and over, and over again. It's like Binding of Isaac, but with more pixel-ey graphics, which are infact a lot more pleasant to look at. The graphic type makes it look very inviting as it's simple and makes it seem like the game is simple; which it is, run around, collect stuff, craft, kill stuff, advance in levels, gain skills etc. Aswell as this, the different types of biomes are well thought-out as you can encounter many different monsters, and you can choose which of the 3 random biomes you want to enter, some appearing more than others.Personally, singleplayer in this game is as much fun as multiplayer. In multiplayer, you've got your friends and all and you can have a laugh, but what's great is that the monsters scale depending on how many people are playing. I realised this when I kept on dieing in multiplayer, but can play almots outstandingly in singleplayer.Also, the game gives you different types of races, which have different benefits and starting items, and it also gives you hats and companions, both giving you different benefits and both have different ways you can obtain them. One of the hats, the ""Robin Hood Hat"" as I like to call it, has a 20% unlock chance when you've shot 100 or more arrows in a single playthrough. That gives you the chance to try and complete that challenge, all be it a very easy challenge. However there are some other challenges which are even harder!The Overworld Helm is unlocked by completing the game and not being hit once. Not once! The Djinn race is unlocked by completing the game and only killing 1 enemy.As you can see, some challenges are hard, some are easy, which is good as you can start completing these challenges as you get better at the game.Overall I really recommend Magicite as you will have a lot of fun playing it and it has a lot of replayability. The price that they're asking for is worth it."

There's a nice curve in difficulty - players learn how to avoid basic enemy movement patterns and adopts strategies for attack in the first few levels. In later levels enemies perform new patterns that the player must adapt to or suffer greater penalties to health than before. I revel in the challenges the game presents, and the way it rewards skillful movement and planning. Each town is a welcomed rest and keeps the action engaging rather than exhausting.Multiplayer should be an even greater joy, it's great fun coordinating with a friend and reaping the efficiency of two players dividing duties and actively harvesting resources. however multiplayer has always ended in a mess for me and my friend. I'm unsure if it is due to poor connection because the initial levels work without a hitch. Once we'd reach level 10 and on though everything starts to go to hell. Enemies lag out of place, projectiles spawn unattached to a source, flickering phantoms of beasts would hover in place after death. Occasionally the ground wouldn't load and I'd fall into an inky abyss. It's worse that the multiplayer functions at all because it's only after great progress has been made that everything goes wrong. In one round I even lagged a full level behind. My friend would enter a door, and I'd enter the (unplayable)level he'd just been through.I understand that with a rogue like game you can't just have a player joining part way through, so allowing a disconnected player to reconnect might not be the best solution. But most games with multiplayer I've played will at least give you an indication that the connection is unstable. It'd be nice if the game recognised a poor connection, and stalled or paused players to try and reconnect/ stabilize. I admit I have no idea what is necessary to actually maintain a multiplayer session, but my experiece so far with it has always ended poorly, and that experience is all I can contribute. If the connection issues could be fixed up I'd happily buy copies just to distribute them to friends and spread the joy, but for now I Guess I'll wait til my friend and I can get a better connection :/"

I hope most of them get fixed soon! but the ONE thing that I really don't like about this game at all, it that in multiplayer you can hit your friends. That is highly annoying. Can you please make an option to where you turn friendly attack off? That would be awesome. Also make it so you can sell items. I saw in the alpha that there was a total level? like that showed progress and unlocked stuff after you die? Why is that not in this one? That looked really cool aswell.

This game in it's complete state may even be better than terraria, which me saying that means a LOT, because Terraria is for sure one of the best games I have ever played, and now so is this. My main point here is please give an option to friendly attack online, that would make Magicite game sooooooo much better to me. Thank you Sean for this great game! Hope you update it fast and frequently!!! Cause this game could be HUGE. With hard work and listening to the community, I'm sure you can pull it off:) I really want to see this game go far. Take off friendly attack from online and that sells this game as the best game ever for me. Thank you for making this game, Magicite is truly amazing Sean, keep updating it, good luck!"

As well as the simplicity of the crafting of items. The bad things about this game are that the beginning mobs are to powerful. You may need to nerf them a little or make a world generator that starts you off in a happier style biome with few aggresive mobs but plentiful peaceful mobs such as pigs or chickens.Suggestions: You may want to give the player a crafters guide because it took me a about 20 min. to figure how to make wooden planks. This crafting guide should only include basic recipes such as tools and essentials.Overall this is a pretty good game but it needs some work...

I Love it when a game does that. It's a roguelike game which is pretty challenging (especially at first) and with tons of charm, not to mention an addictive gameplay loop (recommend reviewing a wiki for crafting guides, just to see what is possible and to help get over that initial learning curve). I'd say if you love games like Spelunky or Rogue Legacy, you owe it to yourself to give this one a try.Update: The latest update (v2.0 hotfix) seems to have introduced some nasty glitches :( When playing last night, any time I lit a fire all of my controls in the village stopped working except WSAD.  Esc out and then resuming the game then allowed me to talk to the villagers again but trying to light another fire to cook food broke my inventory. This happened in every village, something went wrong and all of the menus and controls just stopped working. Now, funny thing is, during this very glitchy playthrough I finished the game for the first time lol :)"

So far the game is playable but some improvments could be made to make it even better and some of these are in every game. First I shall say why it's a great game because what's the point of saying what could be improved if I haven't talked about the game in general. It's a rogue like 2D platformer (less platformy) the game is perma death and you have to start over when you die which is easy and it's not friendly. The survival aspect consists of a hunger bar, a health bar you fill these with health postions which a few and far between and eating food which you find by killing each live stock animal type. On most areas you will have a small slime which will do a tiny amount of damage a higher level mob which is harder a live stock animal and at times you can run into a boss. Inbetween each area there is a safe village which you can sell and buy and craft higher level items. The rest is cutting trees, crafting and mineing however this is no clone of Terraria or Minecraft. You can unlock equipment and perks and new characters by getting further in the game so even if you die if you got further on your next run you will likely unlock some new item or hat which makes it worth playing over and over. Multiplayer is hamachi based typical 4 player co op and all that jazz. Combat is quite weighty which adds a degree of skill (timing and dodging). It would be nice to have a save point of sorts since runs can be lengthy. Maybe make it more friendly for newer player instead of looking up videos and tutorials online. Apart from that the game is great and I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of challanging, simple (to a degree), co op, rogue like, platformer experience with some survival elements mixed in."

,Recommended,268750,10852842,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,RealM,"My experience with MagiciteImagine Terraria and Spelunky. Two great games. And then combine them.So what comes out? Another great game!Magicite is a rogue like survival game with RPG Elements, where you farm minerals and materials,and try to craft better weapons and gear once you are in a town. (There's always a level --> town --> level --> town --> etc.). Really important is Inventory management, since you only have limited space and you still need space to craft materials together. So if you just harvest everything you will soon run out of inventory space. This can be annoying for beginners,since they don't know what materials exactly are important,but it's also a strength of the game: It is really fun to just combine different things with Shift - Click and experiment to see what comes out! (If you don't like experimenting there's always the Wiki to help you out!)Once you understand the depth of the game you will notice that you can specialize yourself on one ""class"":- A Warrior (High ATK,DEF stats and melee weapons)- A Ranger (High DEX stat and a Bow with different types of Arrows)- A Mage (High MAG stat and 3 different Magic Weapons as it is right now)It is really fun to farm ores and materials to craft better gear for your character,because every new item you craft has a noticeable impact on your character (wheter it is damage or HP or DEF).Another strength of Magicite is the ""unlock system"": Once your run ended (by death or by beating the game), you get the chance to unlock certain characters or hats. Different characters have different starting conditions,which can influence your run and different hats give you different bonuses.Keep in mind: Most unlockables only have a chance to get unlocked so even though you reached certain goals, the unlockables are not guaranteed. This can be sometimes frustrating,if you have a 50 minute run (definetely a possilble time) and you die because of stupidity and unlock nothing new.What kinda weakens the whole experience,is that Magicite doesn't really seem finished.There is a final boss and the current version is over 1.0 but it seems like there could be way more.Because once you actually understand the whole crafting mechanism,it seems really simple.(Important to point out here is,that the game is still being worked on and new content WILL come in future updates)There are some points that I didn't really talked about, so I will list a summary of all Pro's and Con's:TL;DR SummaryPro's- Super Mega Awesome Soundtrack (seriously this is important to mention,it creates a perfect atmosphere)- Lovely Pixeldesign / Graphic- Feel your character becoming stronger,so every Level Up and new Item feels like progress- Acquire 3 individual Skill out of 3 different ""Skill - Pools"" at level 5, 10 and 15- It's fun experimenting with different strategies to see what works best for you- Challenging bosses and an epic final boss- Constant Time pressure that creates tension (Some might argue that this is a Con,I personally like it)- It's really fun to play overall, once you understand how the game works- Multiplayerseemsreally fun (Gotta admit I have not yet played Multiplayer... None of my friends own this game)- Randomly generated Levels --> Every run feels new and different (forgot to mention this earlier...)Con's- Beginners might get frustrated,since this game is certainly hard and not self - explanatory. (Experiment or go to the Wiki)- You might get frustrated if you have a long run and because of bad luck you unlock nothing new...-  EDIT: In this part,it used to say that playing as an archer seems to be the only viable option. Now that I played the game even more,the mage class started to appeal more and more to me. So playing as an archer is definetely NOT the only way to complete this game. (even if it might make your life easier). However, I still dislike the warrior,since he is put in the most danger when dealing damage,since he is melee based. This might be only my opinion though.In the end I can safely say, despite having a few weaknesses, the game is overall a really good and fun experience and I strongly recommend it.P.S.: This is my first Review. I hope it is helpful. Sorry for any grammatical errors, english is not my first language."

He released ONE, and LAST update for the game, which hasn't even fixed the majority of the bugs.In conclusion, this game has a lot of potential, but a lot of bugs and close to useless features.

However, the game quickly becomes monotonous. There are unlockable ""classes"" and equipment that can vary playstylesslightly, but in general the game is short, lacks variety between runs, and gets boring fast.Multiplayer is where this game shines. It breaks up the monotony, allows you to specialize for a certain role in a team setting, and offers fun experiences with friends. The problem is that the multiplayer in this game is extremely buggy.Extremelybuggy. There is an ungodly amount of lag (even in a LAN), graphical glitches (your teammate may appear to be in one location on your screen, but is actually somewhere completely different) and game-breaking crashes/black screens. After several (at least 20+) multipler attempts, both on LAN and over the internet, me and my teammates were still unable to complete even one successful run. Every single time the town hub area in between levels would glitch out and completely break the game at some point, preventing progression and forcing a restart.This game is not worth an outrageous $10, but itsn't trash. I was able to get a couple of hours of enjoyment out of it at least, but the the rest was just multiplayer frustration. If you want it, get it on sale (I think I picked it up for about $2.50).

My friends didn't like this idea so i assume its not very safe. but it works and i liked it.So in game its good, but i could only try it once because my friends stopped playing beacuse of the rougelike aspect i believe. doesnt matter.Multiplayer works just like solo, but then better. There is lots of room for experimentation and strategies.Your team can be dealt into positions. for Example.: theWarrior: strong melee guy that runs through killing mobs in early game. With really good killing potential in his skills.Backup: can be mage or archer(very strong classes, but in early game no equipment to be useful)in early they would be the ones crafting and mining/gatheringthere are lots of passive skills that lets you gather more materials or lets you craft better potions etc.these skills can make your early game easy as heck.sadly these passives are given randomly at character select which is really weird in multi and solo mode :\Archer: long range guy can kill mini bosses etc without taking a hit. needs arrows(lots)Mage: i havent had the chance to play this class because gathering resources to craft wands is very difficult(i always try to kill mobs that are in my way so thats a bad combi)but i did manage to get a wand once and this guy works almost like an archer but needs no ammo(only mana that regenerates fak yeah?!)pretty hard to utilise wouldnt try to do it soloLong post and i has no potato. :[Very good game.

The combat gets repetetive and boring after a while and the enemies are the same. The enemies are just retextured versions of eachother. The combat is just you standing next to an enemy and clicking Left mouse button until it dies. Other than that the art style is nice and the town music is soothing. a small tutorial would be nice and after you craft something that tip at the bottom should dissapear. Also, inventory space is a big problem after you start getting stuff because crafting become a hassle. There should be a side gui for crafting somewhat like minecraft since everything is made with 2 components. If not that, then backpacks should be a craftable item of varying size depending on the materials used (regular hide for small sized backpack, and then like in increases by 2 slots every tier) Infact I actually like that idea of backpacks more than a side gui. Or both. but that seems eccessive being that there are not a lot of items. I feel like there should be more weapons and that skills should be able to be picked. And character creation is little to none, which subtracts from the rpg side of this. You should also be able to pick what traits and stats you want since I end up clicking away at the stats button till I get what I want anyways; so it seems pointless to make traits and stats random, more like a waste of time to me. Also the amount of multiplayer bugs is crazy. Loading into an area is always scary and it's super laggy. I wouldn't reccomend buying this if you're just wanting to play with your friends because I have to say the multiplayer isn't worth it right now.TL;DR:Pros:- Cute Art Style- Easy to learn- (atleast in my opinion) The music in the towns is really nice.Cons:- repetetive combat for all classes (really lacking in diversity)- inventory too small- character creation is little too none, and takes WAY too long due to the fact that your stats and traits are completely random everytime you make a new character.*EDIT*: To be completely honest, there is a very VERY easy way to fix all of this. Make the game modable. Because then modders could fix bugs and add more, and make the game great again!

Moreover, the melee play-style is frustrating and severely underpowered compared to ranged and magic, so there are only two viable skill paths to take instead of three.

,Recommended,268750,11009227,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,DZAladan,"This game caught my attention immediately due to the graphics: it looked very colourful and full of lights. Since this kind of graphics always catches my attention, I started watching some gameplays until I started playing myself.What I found was a very cool mix between a roguelike, a platformer and a survival. And VERY hard.> PROSGraphically, the game looks very nice: a pixelated style mixed with very shiny colors. Quite appealing to the eyes according me.The crafting system is very simplified (click two items to combine them) but for a game like this I think that it's just perfect.The combat system does not accept ""LEEROY JENKINS"" people: attack enemies recklessly will 90% sure end with your own death. Being careful is the key and good players who learn this will be prized.> NEUTRAL and VARIABLESince this game is still in development, there are some things missing, like a main menu music, some sounds effects and also some little bugs. But the game is fully playable.The crafting itself can be a little nuisance for newbies. First of all, there is no in-game instruction for how to craft certain items, like a sword (which you need to fight enemies). If from a side, part of the fun is discover how to make it, on the other side can appear a little annoying, especially because items don't last forever and you'll have to try all possible combinations to discover how to make a sword, an axe or a pick, unless you have a guide.But on a positive side, since crafting is very simplified, it's easy to memorize them.The controls also are an headscratcher, but this depends by the person. Surely who never played Minecraft will learn quickly how to play this, but in my case sometimes happens that I try to open the inventory with ""E"" (which is a dash to the right) instead of ""R"", making me run into traps by accident. Plus, moving a pointer (used to attack, especially with arrows) using the mouse can be a little disorienting: it works on first person games like Minecraft but for this, which controls the camera and can even go over the character view, can give some problems. Especially when you have to attack an enemy and you have to move the mouse from a side to another. Sometimes I forget to do this because I mostly press buttons. But this is subjective and other people can be perfectly OK. Plus, I think that those controls give this game its difficulty.> CONSSo far, the only true con I found in this game is this: the lack of a save feature.Did you just made a great run but now you are tired, you want to close the game and rest a little?Well, too bad: if you do, you lose everything. You have two choices only: die or finish the game. I hope that a save feature will be implemented in the future.> VERDICTThis game is HARD. You must learn to master the controls and all the various mechanics before you can even go over the first district. But once you learn, I can guarantee it will be a fun experience.I personally like a lot roguelikes because of their high repleyability and this is no exception, thanks to the various unlockable things (classes, hats, companions and so on) which can make each run different.The game has still some features to be implemented so probably there are more and more updates on the way. I will update this review accordingly.> VOTE7 / 10"

I hope the author has future plans for the game, and take it or leave it, all the hours invested feel good, but once you unlock things there is nothing more to do but run it again, and again and again...Me and my daughter have fun playing, but more races and more (maybe less powerful) achievements would be a welcome variety... way more levels are needed, and there should be an option to continue past the ""last boss""... starting over after all the acheivements are gained makes the game feel old fast, but trying to gain the achievements in the first place is the fun part."

It's level-based, which are free-roaming side scrolling levels taking place in different biomes. There is no building, which I appreciate in this game, but there is crafting to make weapons and equipment. The game doesn't pause durring crafting so you better be in a safe place, and don't take your time cause the scourge will take your♥♥♥♥♥out.This game could really use some gamepad support. I mean... *Ahem*, nudge and wink to the devs... GAMEPAD SUPPORT would make this game really rad.Maybe it's me, but the HITBOXES could use some tweaking.

I've heard that the multiplayer has problems, but I have not experienced it myself to be sure. There are three different main character types you can use based on various stats. Warriors use attack to do damage with swords (though the other builds use swords as well in situations where they do not have magic/arrows). Mages create staffs with gems made by bugs which scale with the magic stat. Archers use bows and arrows which scale with dexterity. There are three different armor types as well which you combine either bars or drops from enemies with bars at their respective stations in the towns between levels to make. Combine monster hides and then combine the product with bars to make dex armor materials. Just combine the bars to get attack armor. Combine the product of two monster pelts with bars to get magic armor materials.Tips: Just like in Dark Souls, dex builds are way better than strength builds. But seriously, unlock the Dwelf, mine every rock you see, combine bars of rocks, bone, iron, gold, or diamond with sticks to make arrows (mine everything you already have tools and armor for for arrows, even lower tier ores) Just make iron axes, anything of a higher tier is a waste. Warriors and Mages do not have anything on Archers. Beat the game on my third try as an archer."

Given time it becomes very fun and a great challenge, the character is customisable with different races, different hats, companions and varieties of a race.

I currently don't have anyone who I know playing this yet, so I have yet to explore the adventure with others.The art style is just sooo cute. I love the slimes the best. This game starts of super cute and fun with the slimes, bunnies and pigs but go into the wrong portal and hell awaits. I think it's a fun way to explore diffrent places and a good way to test how good you are at the game. It may be a little sad when you die and you got so far but each time you play you get better and better.Just don't stay still for a long time....you will face the horrible fate that has come across you."

That's right! So if you have that one friend who storms through the level and kills everything while youare peacefully catching fairies, you get all the EXP that they do too!+ 3 different ""Skill Trees"" so to speak, based around Magic, Dexterity, and Strength. So you can be an archer, mage,warrior, or even try to create a mix between them with the game's varied weapon choice.+ Many different bosses that will kill you over and over with their plethora of unique, (yet annoying,) skills.+ Replayability! I want to say that I've beat this game at least 10 times, while I've played it around 50 times. Even if youbeat the final boss, It's never over. There are so many hats and races to unlock that you can invest hours into runningthe dungeon over and over with your friends!+ Level scaling. Don't have any friends? That's ok because they make the game harder anyway! The bigger the numberof players, the stronger the enemies are! But that also means 4 times the resources to compensate.+ An amazing soundtrack that is both ambient and exciting!+ While this game has a pixel-style vibe to it, it's still beautiful! The glowing effects, the details in the landscape, theblood of your enemies on the floor...+ The game is updated frequently. Tired of running through the same levels over and over? Don't worry! The gamedevelopers release patches and updates very frequently to add new biomes, weapons, races, or even just bug fixes.Are you sold yet? Yes? Well then before you buy it at least let me tell you about a few problems...- This game is a work in progress so there are bound to be a few small bugs here and there but they get fixed prettyquick.- The mechanic to sell items is still a little unbalanced. (ex. a single stick could be worth 3 gold, and then a diamondsword could also be worth 2-3 gold.)- This game IS a rogue-like so if you die, you have to start from the very beggining again. (I personally find this as aplus, but most of my friends think otherwise.)- You have to be able to port foward or at least use hamachi if you want friends to join your game. (Again I don't thinkthis will be much of a problem for most people but i decided to list it anyway.)- Becase of the random stat roller, it can take a long time to roll good stats with equally good traits, or if you arelooking for a specific build, (Mine is Potion Brewer + Swift).- Although the developers have been very good about fixing connection issues, some people may still lag or disconnectfrom the game, though most of the time that's just because of their internet.Obviously there are a few more bugs that I haven't mentioned, but they will probably get fixed over time and I didn't want this to just be a bug list.And that's it! Overall the cons really aren't that bad or game breaking, and I would definitely give this game a try! It's worth the money, and if your friends can afford it, then even better! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go try to beat the new boss, Axelark III... for the 7th time..."

You may need to check the wiki for crafting recipes and the like, but you won't need to check it that often after a few playthroughs.

Since then, every update has only improved an already amazing game.  A brutal roguelike, this game punishes you for every mistake in combat, but gives you the tools to dodge, attack from a distance, and obtain a larger health pool, so that (most of the time) you can only blame yourself.  This isn't to say you can't get an overwhelming amount of bad luck.  Facing down two tyrannox, a bee, and a couple boars while dodging spiked blocks can (and likely will) happen to you right off the bat at some point, but most of the time, you get a fair chance to prepare or avoid such things.The crafting in Magicite is simple, minimal, essential, and for the most part, intuitive.  Once you understand that you can only combine two items, experimentation will likely result in figuring out how to make fires, cook food, make basic tools, and basic potions.  Very few things in the game are not obvious from basic crafting practice (drums and enhancing a certain rare sword).  Overall, it encourages enough item collection to enhance your character without feeling like a terrible grind.  The longest you ever have to grind is for enough sticks for arrows if you want to be an archer, but you'll need two easily obtained stacks at most.As for your character choices, you can customize a setup for your preference, but you usually have to choose to be a spellcaster, an archer, or a melee fighter.  Currently, melee is the easiest to power up your attack for, but also by far the hardest to play (because you are constantly in danger).  Archer's are the easiest to play, but require the most maintenance (you always need ammo), and spellcasters are somewhere in-between (not always easy to access the items for your basic staves, and a bad run of it with skills can make going out-of-mana a true hazard).  However, despite being locked into a less-than-obvious class choice, unlockable races, hats, and companions (companions being one of the most valuable, and most difficult, set of unlockable items) ensure you will have a lot of choices after you start playing through multiple times.Finally, multi-player.  This game needs work on its multi-player, but it's already fun (if you can set it up).  Currently it only supports LAN games normally, so some external networking effort is required to play over the internet.  In addition, playing with multiple people has a few bugs (that are being worked on) and some imbalances (which are currently not being addressed... yet).  Only the host can see the crystal nodes needed to ease the defeat of the final enemy (and, in fact, the only decent way a melee player can attack it).  Often you won't find enough ore for everyone to upgrade their armor (or melee's weapons), and there is only really enough for one archer's arrows (which is just as well, since they have it easier).  Food also becomes a lot more scarce, because you have multiple people growing hungry, and while the enemies have more hp in a multiplayer game, they do NOT drop more food or become more plentiful.  That all said, playing with a friend can be a very fun and rewarding experience.All in all?  Buy this game.  Play this game.  Love this game."

It feels as a roguelike game, difficult, but that ONE thing that killed you could have been avoided. The game feels like a survival journey as much as an RPG, with limited amounts of health potions and gradual biome progression. However, the biomes don't seem to get any harder on their own, with the only increase in area difficulty being that the biomes gradually swap each other out in an attempt to get you to go to the harder zones. The game is about risk versus reward in an aspect, as running into a difficult biome will also grant you access to plenty of treasure chests or high amounts of valuable ores. However, said biomes often end up having enemies hard enough to take out your level 30 character in a mere 4 hits without any health potions to rely on.Overall, the game has its ups and downs, but the mix of aspects in the game end up making it worth buying."

It randomly generates the caves every time you play so it is always a different experience and the crafting is quick, simple and easy to remember, which is good since you can't stay in the same place to long or you might die.  You can't go through the game too quickly either or you also might die that way too.  There is plenty to explore in Magicite and its worth doing so when you never know what may happen next.  Also, despite this game being hardcore, I never found it to be frustrating and I was always glad to start over because I knew I could do better the next time.  A fun game for those who are up to the challenge."

Brilliant start on what could become even better. The most impressive thing about it is that although it causes me anger and rage i still find myself playing it. Another good thing is you'll learn to craft and stuff it may be confusing to figure out but once youve learned the way to play you should probably enjoy it.

Would be way easier to self-pick the perks instead of shuffling 10 times for the preferred combo- Axe's are next to useless due to the previous time adaptions for quicker weapons- Some abilities are just re-skins for different classes.7/10. Fun to play by yourself, or with friends. But, wastes a lot of your time with simple loadout arrangments and trips over itself with minor problems.Wait until more content comes before purchasing it at full price. The developer updates the game periodically, and cares about it, so that will come soon, perhaps."

I can be found  screaming at my monitor for every 10-20 minutes or so every time I play this game, throwing tantrums like a 2-year old at a supermarket... and yet I keep playing. Got it on sale for myself and now I wished that I had got the 4-pack on discount.As a single player it can be very addictive. As a multiplayer co-op game I think the fun would be in coordinating with your friends as well as having the back and forth banter trying to make sure everyone will not die of starvation or from being mauled by a wildboar.This game has the charm of classic and old school 2D games but with better graphics. Keep a wiki open on standby for recipes crafting and etc. There's no hand holding here. I wish the developers would make sandbox levels and non-permanent death options available. Oh please, please, please.... PRETTY PLEASE... and please make it able for players to save their progress.Update: For now I have decided to not bother playing till the next update, hopefully more playable rather than dealing with skyrocketing blood pressure levels everytime my character dies a permanent death... losing all progress... losing all hope."

This game is simply amazing.Magicite has most of all the genres you can find in a game nowadays, and that alone makes it a gem worth digging for.It has the elements of a hack-and-slash dungeon crawler rpg with customizable classes, such as being a greatsword swinging wizard or fireball shooting knight. There are endless possibilities to your character and how you go through each run.It also has survival elements, as seen with a well done crafting system. You have to make almost all of your gear yourself or find it inside rare little chests. Not to mention the hunger bar looms over you, making you feel like life is even more important. Death is permanent, so you had better make each step count and choose your battles wisely.Not to mention the great use of the pixelated style. It looks like an old school game, but is fluid enough to stand with the modern day competitors.The creator of this game is a genius in my opinion, and I would recommend this to everyone and anyone who's even considered the rpg universe. It is well worth the 10 dollars."

The monsters are ALL very tricky at the beginning, but after a few hours, you should be able to master them without taking damage.  The level design is very repetitive, although I somewhat like that you can see the entire world, top to bottom, and don't have to explore up and down at all.  Crafting is MEH, there need to be a LOT more items, and more unique ones... you can pretty much make identical, albeit more powerful items depending on the materials used, which isn't interesting at all.  The inventory menu needs to be made larger, and the only way to get gold (which is, at last in the early/mid game, the only way to get decent armor) is to monotonously chop down every tree in every level, since all items have the same $2 selling value, you may as well load up on 99x wood in each inventory slot.I think this game has potential, but needs to be greatly expanded upon.  I'd recommend it if you've played through other, more polished games like Terraria, Risk of Rain, Don't Starve, but honestly, the quality and depth of all those games eclipses Magicite by so much, it'd be tough to move on from them to a strict downgrade.  That said, I'm looking forward to what the creator has in store for Magicite, there's a lot of room for improvement, and sometimes it's nice to have a ""lite"" version of Terraria to play."

In this District you face off against the final boss. I have discovered that it is quite difficult to beat, there are just simply too many enemies that spawn. It would be great if you can even out the ammount of enemies, perhaps make different sections of the level. One section could contains several enemies and another section lets the player prepare/heal up and collect shards. Another issue I have is the agro of the mini-spiders within the cave levels, they tend to agro simply when I enter the level.Also I do comprehend that this is a bit of a beta-build and believe that once this game is 100% completed it will become a master-piece but until then there are still a couple of bugs that can be fixed.Keep up the outstanding work!"

First it's crafting is very difficult to get the hang of, all you have to do is shift click two items and it combines it for you. Simple right? Wrong! Figuring out what to put together is the hard part. If you have ever played mine craft throw every little piece of information you know about crafting out the window. To make a sword hilt it is a wooden plank and a stick then to make the blade you combine two wooden planks then combine the sword blade and hilt and you have craft a sword, see what I mean? And it's all like this as well. Not saying it's bad, in fact i really like it but it is a little confusing at first. Second, the world are randomly generated which I love! This adds sooooo much replay value to the game and a bigger challenge. This brings me to number three, this game is hard as BALLS good lord this game is challenging. It's challenge level is up there some where between super meet boy and dark souls, no joke. But the fact that every thing is different every single time makes it harder because you cant remember and strategize for it. Number four, the combat and skills. I'm still really new to the game but the combat is fairly simple, all you do is click and it swings the sword but you also have a dash left and dash right so you can dash in, swing, and dash out with out being hit. The skills, every couple times you level up a little box with three pictures appear, I am not sure what they do but I do know that the red picture is for attacking with swords and axes and up close combat. To use these you just hit z, x, or c corresponding to the picture location next to your life bar. Number six, there is an interesting feature to the game, when you accomplish a certain thing you have a chance to get a new race or a new hat which each have advantages and disadvantages to you play through. Finally this is just a question I have, WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE FLOATING HEADS THAT CHASE YOU THROUGH THE FREAKING LEVEL?!?! they're these floating purple head that chase you down as you are going through the level. they hit 9999 damage and have killed me more than anything. I don't believe there is a way to kill them but if there is let me know. All and all I would gove this game a 9.5/10"

Alas I was happily mistaken again, this game combindes the fun game type, and fast advancement of terraria, the adventure and bleak crafting of minecraft, and the sudden merceless deaths of dark souls. A thought child of games that no one may ever replicate. I first got it during this year's christmas sale for 5 bucks, albeit after playing it, it is worth the same as any new game for counsole coming out. It will keep you captivated, and still be a flappy bird style game, you fail after so much, and yet go ""ahh what the heck, ill give it another shot"". I do have to remark that the multiplayer (unless over actual lan (ie NOT hamachi or evolve)) is REALLY laggy the further in you get, and I mean unplayable, people fall through the world, people standing next to you yet fighting a monster at the edge of the map, monsters hurting more than one player at a time by being in multiple places at once.All in all i find this to be a fun game, but if you want to play multiplayer, make sure you can go to someone's house.Replayability 10/10 you will come crawling back every timeMultiplayer 5/10 Works for lan, but is impossible to play over the internetPlayable for hours 10/10 you will get lucky in some games, and just keep goingRagequitability 11/10 *smashes computer* yep definantly, i have a dented keyboard to prove itPlain Fun 10/10 *to busy playing to write anything here*over all46/50, all fantasic, just work on that multiplayer a bitEDIT: Multiplayer over hamachi (untested on internet or evolve) works with just one other person, or with multiple people on actual LAN, *IE* I played with my friend on hamachi (just one friend) and we could play flawlessly, then my friend came over to my place and played with both of us, and it still worked, but any more than one person over the internet and its game over"

76561198110491193,Recommended,268750,10166632,"Posted: 18 May, 2014",all,Intrepid,"Magicite is an addicitng game of crafting, strategy, and survival. In it, you star as a lowly peon (or other unlockible race) as you fight monsters underground in order to make your way to the surface world. There's a lot of craftible weapons, armor, and potions, as well as special abilities and hats with various effects (any TF2 player will know just how important it is to have hats in a game). The various biomes you traverse include grassland, veldt, tundra, lava, cave, and dungeon, and they are all randomly gererated, with their own sets of enemies. This adds a lot of strategy to the game, as no two areas will ever look alike or have the same enemy placement. Resource management will also be a big factor during gameplay.The creator, Sean Young, is very dedicated to the game and has put a lot of work into it to make it the game it is today. I got this game a couple months ago [March 2014] back when it was still in ver 0.7.3., and a lot has changed since then. However, the in-game bestiary, quest generation system, and PvP battle arena that were mentioned on the game's kickstarter page have yet to be added, but that may change as time goes on. The game is now on ver 0.8 and just got a lot of new content added.Honestly, as fun as single player is, the real fun is experiencing this game with a friend. It is a lot of fun to plan out long-term goals and strategies with them and work towards meeting those goals. When your plans go off exactly as you planned and you both display excellent coordination, it's hard not to be excited about it.Overall, the game just keeps getting better with each update and it is still being worked on, so I would say that there is no reason to not get this game. Whether you play it alone or with a friend, you are bound to enjoy this game and also get extremely frustrated when your charater dies (I forgot to mention until now that this game uses a permadeath system), so if your character dies one you will need to start from the beginning again. It really isn't that big of a deal, but if you are someone who dislikes permadeath I would not recommend this game to you. For those who stick with it though, you will really enjoy everything this game has to offer."

,Recommended,268750,12271120,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,K!netic,"Magicite stared at me from the steam page for months before I grudgingly tried it on a hunch. I found a game that was pretty, fluid, simple, and fun.The permadeath works - it's not lame. Every death or two gives you more hats, classes, or ideas on how to progress. Instead of being a burden, the permadeath acts as a way for you to clean the slate and do better. It's healthy.The game lasted me around 15 hours. I beat the boss multiple times, each taking me around 20 minutes (i think). Eventually you get used to how the enemies work, and the game becomes an exercise in muscle memory. Unlike similar games (like rogue legacy), this muscle memory doesn't get challenged very much. It won't put you into situations where 3-4 enemies with different powers are spewing them all at once, and you have to navigate the world to defeat them. Instead, magicite tests your patience. You have to identify each enemy and be careful with them - because regaining health is difficult. By the end of the game you'll be taking enemies out at range more often than not, because you won't be finding enough potion materials to heal yourself. Only one or two equipment/hat/trait/skill combinations can keep you healed, and even then it's tiresome and slow to heal to full (notably, the ice queen hat, clairvoyance skill, and high MAG).After all this invested time, my big gripe is that melee is just too important. The three different general paths (melee, archer, magic) are fun and play differently, but it always boils down to using your sword. No matter how you build, the sword is the only ifinite source of damage; your magic will run out fast and regen slow, and your arrows compete with armor for crafting materials. So it feels a bit like the magic/archer classes are more work than they're worth. Even with the right skills and playstyle, it doesn't usually feel like they're really worth it.After unlocking most of the items, hats, and races, I think i'm done with it. But at this price, 15 hours of gameplay for $10 was pretty reasonable."

The game is impossibly hard, like the dark souls series, and is one of the best games i own. Even though this games crafting is simple, i love it. It brings a sense of simplicity with all of the insanely hard. I prefer the greataxes in this game even though it can get you killed which of course means you start over with your starting gear and thats it. You can kinda take 10 skill paths to to take, warrior, ninja/archer, mage, or a combonation of your choice. The gameplay is simple, fun, and challenging and makes you want to avoid combat, but also drawing you toward combat with all of the xp and loot and it also gives you a feeling of acomplishment when you actaully kill a mob. There are lots of unlockables, like races, chracter style variants, hats, and even companions. Even though you will die ALOT, this game is very addicting and has a sense of acomplishment when you finish a level. As a warning to anyone new to this game, This game is almost impossible to beat without friends so, get friends to buy this game and play your heart out (almost literally).

For the first 5 hours it was like hell, only being able to make it to floor 2 every other run. But once I started putting time into this game it became easy so fast and by the time I had only 30 hours into it I had unlocked every item in the game. But, even though I had all the items it was still fun to play a run with all the OP gear like the overworld helm, floaty slime, and Djinn. Overall I think it has alot of good qualities but the only thing holding it back from being as iconic as the Binding of Isaac is the lack of enough late game content that will keep players playing for a while. Also, if you do get the game, some challenges like ""beat the game without chopping trees"" or  ""beat the game without killing enemies"" seem impossible becuase they go against everything you have learned so far, but if you  actually start a game with the intentions of not chopping trees, you'll find that its actually not that hard with a proper load out and game plan.

I haven't run into any bugs or errors yet ether so that's a plus.Now about the playing itself it is awesome it is a rouge like platformer similar to Rouge legacy in that it has random spawning floors and has perma death but it's art style is that of almost 8 bit like games which is awesome for those who like to relive the art style it also has character customization such as multiple races, traits, hat's that give there own benefits such as more critical strikes and stat bonuses. It also has skills upon character's leveling up that are broken into 3 groups such as the Warrior, The Mage, and The Ranger. It even throughs in some crafting mechanics as well so if you like these kinds of games this could be a fun game for you.Edit: I also forgot to add about the creatures they come in many shapes and sizes from being easy to being hard there are also several bosses as well, but I will say that some of the creatures do seem to repeat in each area but that could just be me nitpicking so hope you all have fun and if you get the game hope you have a blast with it."

,Recommended,268750,12235281,"Posted: 25 September, 2014",all,noom,"This game is, in my opinion, as good a sidescrolling 2D action-platformer as you'll get. Here are my reasons:The character creation has enough variables, even at the beginning, to offer a unique run to everyone, though through minutes upon minutes of clicking and a whole lot of luck, you can produce the same character every time. You can basically play however you want, with various races, styles, companions and, of course, hats to choose from, each having an effect on the character.The levels are randomly generated, sometimes screwing you over horribly at the beginning and sometimes waiting until you've sunk a good half-hour into the playthrough and got some really nice items before doing so. It's almost always difficult, but a challenge worth taking. It's rewarding to beat the game, not only for the first time, but every time, and there are lots of different challenges for those better than myself, those too good at games in general. Replay value, need I say it, is high.The game is split into levels, each themed to a biome or region. Each area has its own monsters and, in some cases, mini-bosses. Some may have more ore or trees, or more glowy bug things to hit, so depending on strategy, different places have advantages and disadvantages. At the end of each level, you can choose one of three doors to go through, determining the next area's biome, though towards the end, expect a crater or three to appear. You have twenty levels: nine 'wilderness', ten towns and the Scourge Lair (The lair of the Scourge). In true RPG fashion, you must conquer the nine and get your skills as high as possible to defeat the badguy.The multiplayer, though initially faulty, is now working pretty well, so playing with friends is a possibility for social butterflies and other such people with friends. It's not essential to the game, so don't fret if you're missing, y'know, friends. Who needs 'em, right? Anyway, the multiplayer adds a new dynamic: sharing loot. If you're against that kind of teamwork or just really like your stuff, it may not be to your taste. If, however, you don't mind sharing that one herb or extra ironite, or if you really enjoy the results of your selfishness, multiplayer will be at least as fun as singleplayer, if not more so.Finally, the music and artstyle are gorgeous. Like, this game is charming to play, with pulsating, dynamic pixelated backgrounds and one of the best soundtracks my ears have encountered. Except the forest: its music is merely great. The rest, however, are amazing. I'm still holding out for its appearance on the store page.EDIT: Oops. I forgot to mention the crafting. It's good. You can look up crafting guides if you want, but figuring things out yourself is much more fun. So is figuring out what to do with that drum you made while clicking things. I've played for more than thirty hours and still don't know how to use it. Such is life.Basically, you hold shift and click things, 1+1-style. Pretty simplistic.EDIT 2: Since 1.4.5, multiplayer can now also have PvP, so if you really like screwing over your companions and watching their pixelated corpses wiggle on the ground, you do that. It also adds yet more challenge to the co-operative side of the game's multiplayer.---I highly recommend the game. It's just brilliant.Other products are available.---TL;DR: i lik te gaem."

It's not the most original game out there (being a roguelike it does have to play on a somewhat oversaturated playing field though) and neither the most well rounded. But it is a lot of fun to play, and that's the point.It is still being updated, expanded and bugs are continually being squished (in more than one way). The mechanics are fun, combining platforming with combat, either melee, archery or magic. It scales well over the progress of the game, the first biomes being easy and a good place to learn the game, and later biomes being very tough. It's a permadeath so die and you gotta restart, but that's part of the fun. Achieving something you can get lasting items such as hats, companions or even new races to play as that differ from the default.Fun game, and for the price well worth it. Give it a try if you've liked roguelikes in the past."

When I did finally decide to give in and buy Magicite while it was half off, I began playing the game to see what all the fuss was about. After about an hour or so of me becoming more and more heavily addicted to this wonderful creation of a videogame, I proceded to purchase another copy for a friend of mine so we could experience the glory of Magicite as a cooperative experience. I could go on and tell you of the heart pounding, exciting, and intense emotions that were involved; but I won't. Instead I will politely ask you to throw your money at your computer screen and spend hours upon hours dying over and over AND over again.I rate this game 10/10 for giving me one of, if not THE most enjoyable cooperative experiences of my life."

If you like Platformers and Rogue-likes, this game is a must.Pros:Very well done controls for mouse+keyboard play.Beautiful pixel art graphics.At a sweet spot (for me at least) in difficulty.  Easy enough to pickup, but hard enough to prevent you from walking up to the boss on your first 50 tries (Expect to die a lot).Cons:There is some re-use in monster behavior and monster types (eg A stronger/faster purple spider in contrast to the regular spider from the first level)Monster AI is not particularly sophisticated nor hard to figure out how to counter.The bow mechanics.  The bow can fire outside of the range of most of the early monsters, so you can hit them with your bow before they even know that you're near them, making a lot of bow combat one sided with you firing at non-moving monsters.  Arrows are also not affected by gravity, making it really easy to use (maybe too easy).The hunger bar seems kind of like an afterthought and doesn't affect gameplay all that much.  Food is extremely   abundant in most biomes.I like the crafting element, and I like the fact that the game was designed to encourage the player to experiment with resources.  There aren't that many things to craft though, so once you've already learned all the recipies, continuing to do them feels like an unnecessary chore sometimes.That's a lot of cons, but this game is really fun and really addicting and is all-round pretty well designed.  Definitely worth it's list price."

You can play as one of the many in-game races, all with different stats and starting gear. Unlock hats, which give your character certan buffs, race variants, a purely cosmetic customization, and companions, small creatures that follow you around, granting buffs.I will be breaking down this review into a few sections, as seen below.GameplayMagicite starts you off with nothing but whatever your race starts with. Collect wood, mine minerals, and vanquish enemies along the way to each district's exit. After completing a district, you will be break to a town, kind of like a resting place to smelt minerals, craft, and chill for a bit before starting the next district. There are multiple districts, each with their own monsters and loot.Craft things out of collected or bought materials, and gradually level up to bcome stronger, but be warned: this game isHARD. Be ready to die aLOT, and that's not a bad thing.MultiplayerYes, there is online multiplayer! Up to four players can dive into the underground world of Magicite. While there are bugs, the multiplayer experience is the preferred method of playing this game.UnlockablesMagicite offers a healthy helping of unlockable gear, most requiring good play. Unlocking things, even just cosmetic eyes, is extremely satisfying.ConclusionMagicite is a game to be played with friends. While you can solo the game, it is much more fun with the multiplayer experience. The game can be replayed many, many times without boring repetitiveness.

This stays of course but i had to clarify some points and fix this old messy review that i made before.=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=1. My reviews tend to be a bit longer. If that is the case please be patient and read everything.2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]3. If you want to try to change my opinion with arguments that make no sense in any way then please do not comment at all.=REVIEW=This game is truly cute. I love it to bits. Tiny bits if i am going to be honest here because that is what i do in this game. I go in and love them to bits.Now lets be serious. This game is a roguelike 2D Platform Sidescroller and it truly makes itself look amazing. The overall game plays itself very easily and the controlls are just as easy as the game is. But dont think the game is actually easy. The game is just like any other Roguelike game very hard. The game can not only be hard but also nearly impossible at times. Or atleast that is how it seems.In the game you will not get anything. Everything depends on your class and Perks. Well actually it depends only on your playstyle since even with the most amazing perks you will die if you are not good at the game. That means that in the end you can die if you cannot dodge a certain attack or enemy. And if you people know what bullethell means then you know exactly what can come at you.The game has unlockables but you have to do certain things to unlock them. You have to even cheat for one of the unlocks but i am not going to tell you how. The hint is out and now its your thing to find it out. There are three different types of unlockables. Class | Equipment | Pet.The Classunlocks give you different Skins and different Items to start. The Equipmentunlocks give you Hats that give you certain attributs and effects. With one hat you might be able to jump higher or to run faster. With the next one you are able to get more from Mining rocks and ore. The Petunlocks give you Pets. Every Pet has a different effect and remains as a neutral companion who grants you his powers. One pet may grant you Health as you complete a level. The next pet may grant you extra stats up while leveling up.But how do you get all of this? By playing the game a whole lot. And by completing it too. And that is no easy task. If you people are familar with Terraria then you know what the infamous ""Wall of Flesh"" is. The same Enemy waits for you as Endboss with one really big twist. The Level ends at a certain point and is just as long as the other levels. So it is up to you and your playstyle if you live or die.But no matter how frustrating this game was for me i can only recommend this game. It is cute and just amazing. I had a lot of fun playing it even though i am not playing it anymore."
,Recommended,268750,11213946,"Posted: 13 July, 2014",all,Moons,"Very addicting and replayable game. Nice combat, smooth interface and a simple approach to gameplay that is very refreshing. This game is very fun with a friend or two but certainly has it's flaws. The main flaws revolve around 3 things; balance, crafting, and luck.The balance is probably it's worst aspect. Damage and health values are all odd and there is almost no reason to stick to a melee weapon over a ranged bow or magic staffs. Too much risk vs low reward when using melee, even if you are skilled with it. Magic and bow wielders can inflict heavy damage from a distance with little to no risk on taking any damage. You can also hit enemies at a distance without aggroing them so there is literally nothing they will do to stop you. There are many other balance issues but I'll opt not to elaborate on those seeing as this one is my biggest gripe.The crafting system is fun but loses it's spark pretty quickly. It doesn't have much depth at all and after a while most of the resources that you gather become obsolete.Last but not least luck plays too big of a role. Randomized dungeons certain extend replayability but situations where you start off in a district and you're dealing with a big enemy blocking your path should be avoided. Also how lucky you get when gathering things can strongly affect how well you do.I didn't go too deeply into what's wrong with the game seeing as there is a bit. With that said I still reccomend the game. It's highly addicting and very fliud. There aren't many gameplay glitches and everything moves relatively quickly once you get started. Played with the right people this game is definitely a blast and I look forward to future updates that hopefully address  many of my concerns"

,Recommended,268750,11333697,"Posted: 20 July, 2014",all,TylerTheDragon,"As someone who didn't play the early access, I have no opinion on wether the game has improved since then.The game is amazingly good fun, and I'd reccomend it to anybody who likes rogue-like combat-based games.The combat is a nice touch, simply left clicking (or right clicking for some effects) is very cool and it allows you to enjoy the game to the fullest. There are many unique mobs, and enough to fit nicely. You always start in the relatively friendly forest/jungle and have to run through various levels. After that level is complete, you get an option of 3 different rooms, some of these (or sometimes all) can be biomes you already visited or a completely new one. Every time you die in the game, you have to start from the very beginning with nothing on you but the starting gear of that character and the traits you used last time (if you press the play again button, cancelling out resets the character's traits and stats). You may sit there for a couple of minutes trying to get the perfect stats with the perfect traits your character suits.I've discovered 4 different types of ""classes"", Warrior : The basic and most easiest to start with, using swords. Ranger: Using bows and arrows, focuses on the dexterity skill (DEX). Magician: Using magic staves (which are quite limited at the current time) and Barbarian: using Giant axes and Zweihanders, dealing MASSIVE damage. The easiest and most common is the Warrior, as the other 3 are pretty hard to set up early on, and by the time your later on in the game, you already have the best sword... Odviously, you can mix and match these, but these are the 4 main ways of dealing damage.Even though this game is amazing and has no glitches (that I've found, at least), the game has a lot of area's lacking in content. the game is really fun to play, and there are quite a few unlocks, but there's not enough content to make you play over 40 hours, as at that time you've already had everything there is. Not saying 40 hours worth of content is bad, but the fact that there is not a lot of unlocks limits the replayability of the game without having to completely start over, and having a lot more hats, minions, customization and characters would be nice.Overall, the game is great for it's relatively cheap price, so get it if you like the look of the game!"
,Recommended,268750,11313397,"Posted: 18 July, 2014",all,Antonymous,"I was unsure of this game when I first picked it up on sale. On first boot I noticed there was next to 0 load time, which can make games that have to load often very frustrating. Singleplayer is where I started my adventure. I created my guy and I spawned in a nice forest. I survived for about 15 seconds. Belive me, this game is not easy, and it isn't mean to be. You are going to die, a lot. Eventually I got used to the controls, crafting and gameplay and found myself quite addicted. I was really digging the game so I thought I might get my buddies hooked on it aswell. I was quite confused on how to use the multiplayer features in the game until I found a thread explaining most of the details. Multiplayer for me was my only bad experience of the game. After setting everything up with Hamachi my friend could finally join my game. But it was unplayable. Falling through the floor, not seeing the other person move and seeing him chop down a tree that I already chopped down was just a few bugs we experienced. It's annoying how I have these problems while others don't but regardless this game is still a gem.Some things I would like to see are: Achievements, an option to resume a game, multiplayer fixes, in-game chat, a cursor you can see, bug fixes (e.g. game sometimes hangs when you open crafting menu) and full sound (some interactions have no sound)I look forward to seeing this game evolve and wish the developer all the best."

Its a platformer where you roam the underground worlds gathering reasources, crafting items, and killing things. Unless there killing you. In this game you are creating gear and weapons in a quest to take back the over world. Theres no check points, No respawning, No ""Saving"". When you die your dead you start over, your a new person, a new Hero who may or may not defeat the evil ones. You can use magic, friends, spirits and pure strength to make your way through the vast underground caverns. You can play with your friends in up to Four player online Co-op, or roam by yourself and try to survive the Monsters that lurk.I give magicite 9/10 For loads of fun at a very afordable price.Though I will admit that you can die a lot and sometimes that no fun.If you've got $10 sitting around in your room please give this game a try!And for those of you who have bought the game, Good luck Cave Explorers"

76561198110856247,Recommended,268750,14925143,"Posted: 16 March, 2015",all,Bladeengine- Gentleman Knight,"I am writing this rather quickly, in order for it to be available to those considering Magicite while it is on sale, but it should accurately reflect my views on the game.Magicite is most definitely a roguelike, at least in the Isaac/Spelunky sense. It is not a game of a different genre with roguelike elements. However, there are certain aspects that, in my eyes, make it rather odd for a roguelike. I will get to those in a moment. First, the basic concept of the game.In Magicite, you are a solitary adventurer in an underground realm called Deephaven, the place to which the surface dwellers have retreated in the face of an invasion by an enemy called the Scourge. Your objective is to make your way from District One to District 20, the Scourge Lair, and to kill their (assumed) leader, the Scourge Wall (which is rather like the Wall of Flesh from Terraria). In each district, if you linger for too long, the Scourge will appear, and individuals will begin chasing and attacking you, similarly to the Rebel pursuit in FTL or the Ghost in Spelunky.Every other district, starting with District 2, is a town area, with no enemies and an assortment of NPCs, some of which are window dressing and some of which are merchants or artisans.Within regular districts, you will find resources, mainly trees and rocks, which can be harvested Minecraft-style with pickaxes or hatchets. There are also herb patches, which can drop several ingredients, and small shrubs with magical insects living inside, which give special magical regents.Each district, aside from the first and the last, can have one of various biomes. At the end of each odd-numbered district is a set of three doors, each of which is color-coded to show the biome to which it leads. You may pick one then, which will take you to the town level, and then to the biome you picked. Early on they will usually only offer easy biomes, with many resources and weak enemies, with the options gradually becoming more challenging over time.Now, how is this game odd for a roguelike?First, there is a relatively small assortment of items in the game. At first many will be suprises, but after a while, you may come to expect most possible drops- and this includes rare treasure items that are uncraftable. I don't consider this bad, as such, but it heavily reduces the differences from run to run.Second, because most of the items necessary to do well are craftable, you can usually get roughly the same level of equipment run to run by the same points in the game, if you follow the right 'build order' of items, which also tends to reduce the novelty each run.And third, although each District is randomly generated, ones of a given biome are nearly always highly similar to others of the same biome- although admittedly, different biomes are drastically different and interesting. A Swamp level will, at least in my experience, feel pretty much the same as any other Swamp level most of the time. You could argue that Nuclear Throne does the same, with many of its zones, but although many times the, say, first three levels are highly similar to variants you have played before, they are also sometimes quite different instead. In Magicite, that rarely happens, in my experience.Now, I may come across as dislike the game based on this commentary- but actually, other aspects of Magicite more than make up for these points, and honestly, I have grown to like these three aspects of the game. In most roguelikes, because of just how random things become, you have no idea how things will go beforehand. One run in either Isaac could well be different in every particular from your previous run. And in some roguelikes, such as Tower of Guns or Ziggurat, the layout of the first couple floors could well determine if you manage to make it far or if you die immediately, even after a few hours of playing. In Magicite, you can largely determine how you want to play a run when you set up your character, and most of the time, the challenge of a particular biome will be the same run to run, meaning that your success or failure is due almost completely to your own ability- not to snub any of these other games, all of which I greatly enjoy. My point is, because there are many other games which play out different, Magicite's constancy (for a roguelike) makes it somewhat unique, and for me, a pleasing alternative.But most importantly, there are many aspects of Magicite that I find wonderful in and of themselves.Combat- with magic and ranged as well, but primarily melee- weighty and precise, simple and yet difficult to use properly, allowing you to evade most every attack against you if you are practiced enough, yet also making it so that even a few mistakes may end your life. It reminds me some of Monster Hunter, although on a smaller, more responsive scale.Combat Styles- as hinted above, this game has melee, magic, and ranged. Each one feels substantially different, and each one can be used by the same character; or, you can specialize in only one, through armor and leveling. Yes, this game has level-ups, through experience orbs that dead monsters drop. As you level, you will get to pick three skills, each time given the option to choose a class. You will get a random skill (from a small pool) for the class that you picked. You can pick all three from the same class, or one from each, or whatever combination seems strongest for the character you want. It adds an interesting element to the game that otherwise would not exist.Unlockables- most roguelikes have these, and Magicite handles them quite well. There are three types of unlockables: character races, companions, and hats. Races each begin with modifications to their base stats and up to three starting items. Companions provide some form of passive bonus, such as periodic healing or stronger level-ups. And hats provide a single special bonus, varying from a chance to gather double resources from certain sources to special magical attacks from attacking barehanded. All three types allow for interesting builds, especially some of the more difficult to obtain ones. And some are very difficult- such as to beat the game without taking a point of damage, ever. To my knowledge, all are doable, but some seem incredibly difficult. When you set up a character, you pick a race, one companion and one hat, thereby letting you decide how your run will be focused.And finally, Music- which is just superb. Minecraft is my high mark in ambient music, which I have never seen surpassed myself, but Magicite, with some of its town themes and biome songs, comes close. Honestly, just have a listen.All of these combine to make Magicite a suprisingly unique, enjoyable roguelike that feels far more special that it may look at first glance. I would highly recommend this game, especially on sale as it is now. The developer has consistently shown commitment to updating and improving the game, so it could well become even better with time.TL;DR- Magicite is a unique, engaging, and beautiful roguelike that has far more going for it then it may appear to have, although it does not have the same difference between runs and sheer variety of possible items that many other roguelikes have."

One thing though, the game does feature permanent death, which means that once a character dies, you will have to start the game over with a new character. Alongside this, I must say that this game is quite challenging, both in combat and other elements, and I died quite a few times before I got used to it.

(Around Tier2/3 Biomes it gets a bit more strategic)• Improved Camp-fire hit box: By this I mean that it has improved range when trying to cook, though it works fairly well, there has been a instance or two where even though Im on the fire and clicking on it, I instead consume the raw meat rather than cook it. Just a very minor annoyance.• (BUG) When youre facing against a corner on any map, and toss a item, it goes through the wall , into the void of nothingness, and is not able to be repicked up. (Can try to get screenshots soon)• Viking hat: I really like the melee system and combat system, the skills and slow/fast weapon speeds really make for awesome team play, however, being as melee class players have more of a high risk = / = reward factor when fighting more dangerous mobs, I dont see the 10% benefit of the viking hat coming into play. I would find it more reasonable if the % ratio for the viking sword was between 15-20%.• HP gained on level-up ALSO restored: When you level up its a great feeling, the randomized stats is a good feature and increased health is great, but whats NOT so great is that the hp gain doesn't also get restored. For example: I have 5/5 Hp, and I level up gaining a maximum of 5/8 Hp, the 3 HP needs to be healed, rather than already being restored. Now this doesnt mean I want all my health restored with every level up, but we found that it'd be better if health restored what it increased by at the very least.• Possible Healer Npc (Costs gold) included in town ~?• Possible increase in rarity stats on crafted gear? When crafting, we love getting higher tier items with bonus stats, but we feel the rate of crafting a item with bonus stats is fairly low. A increase in the rates would be nice.----------------------------------------------------------Other than that we have no complaints! The game works flawlessly and is providing hours upon hours of entertainment, keep expanding and adding more content!"

Upon buying this game, I noticed the appealing, simplistic graphics and concept of the game first. There's enough content in the game whereas you can endlessly play until you unlock every single item in the game, or do funny and difficult challenges with your friends. When playing multiplayer, there is a big chance of it completely failing randomly throughout the game, causing you to start all over. There's no save function, which is overwhelming, but the fact that there's so much more to unlock gives it replay value, along with the curiosity of what updates are coming next.PROS.Replay value.Tons of unlockables.Multiplayer.Awesome and simplistic graphics.Great animation to go along with the graphic type.CONS.Can be repetitive.Not too many updates, leaves the game dull after a while.Sometimes buggy multiplayer [crashing, lagging, etc][tl;dr]Def buy this game.

Difficulty is high, but mostly because enemies move very quickly in very confined spaces while thwomp-like damage blocks fly up and down for no apparent reason.The game incorporates 3 different class archtypes, warrior, ranger, and mage.  Don't bother with the ranger because crafing arrows require the use of valuable minerals that are better spent on armour and other weapons.  For example, 4 of iron are required to build a sword with 60+ durability, but the same amount of ore will only make 20 arrows.  This is clearly to balance things out since bows don't aggro enemies, but it would have been more fun to have them aggro enemies and allow you to craft more arrows.The warrior class skills are straight forward and fun enough, while I can't say I got far enough to really get the full feel of the mage skills, though they had potential.The reason I can't recommend this game is because it incorporates a mechanic where if you don't clear an area in 5 minutes, a group of enemies called ""scourge"" show up and one-shot you.   In a game that requires a substantial amount of menuing to craft, so it is extremely frustrating trying to make weapons on the fly, as time lost will limit your ability to collect resources and kill monsters for XP.Powerful enemies show up very early in the game, forcing you to avoid them most of the time, which is fine, but by the second area, you start to run into enemies with hundreds of HP, that move very quickly and unpredictably.  Up until that point, the enemies you face had in the realm of 7-40 hp and have clear movement patterns.If you are looking for a game that makes you feel frantic while you try to accumulate sufficient resources to only permanently die part of the way in to start over, this is the game for you.  People who really enjoy a hardcore challenge may take more pleasure in this game than I did, though I personally think most of the challange comes from the poor design decisions mentioned above."

Bought the 4-pack and played with friends and we had a blast.The one thing I'd change about the multiplayer aspect of this game would be the amount of resources that drop should be increased.  You tend to either fight over them or have to really play cooperatively and ration them out to eachother.  I find that I finish the game much easier when I play single-player.  Still a fun time either way, and maybe this will be addressed at some point.Updates are also pretty frequent, which is nice.

I really enjoy playing this game because I love games that are both based on the player's actions and choices as well as the game's ""decisions"". I know that those decisions are based on a RNG but if you are going for a certain play style like I do, it is almost up to the game whether or not you will succeed. I found playing as a ""Warrior"" my first few tries was a good strategy while I was still getting used to the controls and general crafting. However, I decided to try playing as a ""Mage"" and ended up sticking with it because it was really challenging sometimes to get the numerous items necessary to play it, several times, I ended up at District 10 with none of the staffs built. I haven't tried playing as a ""Ranger"" yet, but I plan on trying it soon. The only thing I don't really like is the traits when you go to make your character. I often try to get specific combos of the skills, typically the one that lets you make bigger potions and then whatever else I feel like using at the time. However, I have often been sitting there for minutes at a time trying to get those skills to what I want. I feel that we should at least be able to customize those a little bit, like maybe locking them in as we find ones we want. However, though I don't like it entirely, I feel that it is still actually fair, seeing as how you are going for certain things so it should take a bit. I've also noticed a few weird things about taking/dealing damage. For instance, when using the ice spell, you can't hit an enemy with the same crystal more than once, unless it leaves the enemy's hitbox entirely. This is understandable. However, you can take advantage of the invincibility frames  and actually ride on some enemies. As long as you don't leave that enemy's hitbox, you can stand on top of enemies such as the Tyranox (I probably spelt that wrong but those of you who have played it, know what I'm talking about). If the developers see this, could you maybe change this? As cool as this is, I feel that they should be able to damage you as soon as the invincibility frames are up.Ok, that got rather long, but I feel that I have said everything that I wanted. In summary, I really love this game and look foward to seeing more updates in the future."

I cannot express enough how pleased I am with Sean's work ethic. He's managed to produce two amazing games and is so committed to continuous development, which I find very refreshing.Magicite has hours of play time even though Sean plans on adding more to the game. Whether you're invested in unlocking every hat/companion/race/variant, or if you just love the soothing music and beautiful atmosphere the game presents, there is so much to do. With up to 4 players per server, this is a great game to play with friends. Having also played Roguelands, I enjoyed the challenge of coming back to this game with the added hunger bar, and getting used to the flow. While both games are so similar, they are so unique in their own ways and playing one has taken nothing away from the other.I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who's interested. The game is beautiful and challenging, and Sean is doing a great job, and hopefully doesn't slow down any time soon!"

This is a very amazing example of a Fantasy (Or Phantasy as I like to refer to it as) 2-d platformer, I normally play this whenever I have a small bit of time but not enough to play a larger game. The game takes place underground, when you as the player have fallen far below the surface to escape the corruption and your objective is to slowly maneuver your way through the many random dungeons created. It’s very addicting; a good game to transform into an app however like all app-like games it is very challenging. You start out with very little life, there is a large palette of monsters waiting to slaughter you, if you don’t collect enough resources you will have no chance of surviving in the next level, and on top of all of that if you spend too much time in one level giant purple eyes descend upon you from all directions.

There's nothing wrong with it if you go solo, it just raises the difficulty and lowers the hilarious fun factor. As advertised it’s a rogue-like with short, procedurally generated levels that includes a good bit of risk-reward gameplay. The game loses several points in my book however for its crafting system and control scheme.The craft system is content to let players stumble about, guessing at what they need to do to make something until they get fed up and go to the wiki for recipes. Even something as simple as Terraria's crafting system, giving you a list on the side of everything you can make with what is in your inventory would go a long way. Any game that all but requires external resources to play is docked a point.The controls are fine and responsive but out of place. A and D move you left and right, W interacts with things but Q and E are short dashes. Its basically imposable to press both D and E to do a right dash while continuing to move (and it’s a twitchy game so if you aren’t still moving after a dash its not often useful) therefore dashes only get used in non combat situations like avoiding static environmental damage. Also, your leveling abilities are tied to Z X C V by default which makes it equally impossible to press the Z triple jump ability while moving left. Controller support would have made the game much easier to play.Despite all that, we still had a blast. You will die a lot learning the game but if you have a buddy with you, they can revive you when you do, drastically extending the lifetime of each play through.7/10 Certainly recommended at <$10"

,Recommended,268750,20171993,"Posted: 31 December, 2015",all,Asvarduil,"Once upon a time, rocks fell and everyone died, because Voldemort took over the world...sort of.  You see, he didn't take over all of the world, so humanity fled beneath the surface to previously unexplored caves lush with life that requires sunlight to grow, including but not limited to plants, trees, T-Rexes, Shelob, Bilbo, and...wait, we're still talking aboutMagicite, right?Magicite is a side-scrolling roguelike, where you adventure through areas in pursuit of defeating The Scourge, because Arthas is a wuss...wait, we're still talking about Magicite right?As you can tell, Magicite draws from various RPGs of yesteryear for its inspiration despite being a sidescroller.  Each Death is very important, because you can win new races with different starting loadouts, hats, and companions.But is it good?What WorksThe 2D presentation is amped up by clever use of 3D techniques such as bloom shaders; the UI integrates seamlessly with the rest of the game.  Visually, there are really no faults to speak of in this title.The controls are somewhat intuitive, and pressing Escape brings them up - left clicking 'attacks' with an item, while right click uses an item's special abilities (such as firing an arrow, firing a spell, etc.)  The in-game crafting in particular is well-suited to quickly creating things in order to defeat challenges.The game's tempo is also good; after every area, you find a town, where you can do more in-depth crafting, sell spare items, buy items, and generally take a short breather.  This is good, because each area has a hidden time limit - if you stay too long, the Dungeon Guardian comes and deals you 9999 damage when it hits you...wait, we're still talking aboutMagicite, right?What Does Not WorkThe first thing I noticed is that the physics are sort of wonky, if things land on top of you - they will sort of sit there and inhibit your ability to jump.  Sometimes it autoresolves, but not always - I've been able to blame a death on this particular physics bug.Next, you can gain special abilities as you play through the game.  The controls for these abilities are obscure.  While you can see them with Escape, I find them forgettable and awkward to use.  I'm sure I would find the game more manageable if the special abilities unlocked by leveling up were more obvious, and easier to use.Another thing at least for me is that after a few minutes of play, the audio for the game will mysteriously cut out for seemingly no reason at all.  This is very bad, because the game has a number of audio cues to telegraph certain things (like Scourge invasions).While this is a Roguelite with all of the difficulty such a title entails, I find the game's difficulty curve a touch too high, actually - after a number of playthroughs, I've not managed to fight the final boss yet, and usually die well beforehand due to healing potions being too hard to come by.  While most 'traps' deal 1 damage, monsters usually deal 2, and strong monsters deal 4 damage per hit, in later screens it's possible to have the game more or less transition into a bullet hell game...which, this game is not tuned for.  I rarely say this due to games these days being too easy, but this one I feel is a touch too hard, but not due to my lack of skill, per se - increase the drop chance for Herbs (used to make Healing Potions), and try to tune the RNG to not spawn a bunch of projectile-spamming enemies.  The fact that I can hit more or less unwinnable screens is a Bad Thing™.Lastly, decrease the dependence on the RNG.  I know, I know - Roguelite.  Much RNG is to be expected, but in this game, there are some really pointless randomizations on things - for instance, tools can grant HP gains, but only while you're using that tool.  If you're switched away from that tool, you can have full HP.  Due to the fact that there are no external healing sources, this means with a HP tool, you can never have full HP.  This isn't game-breaking, but it horribly inflames my OCD!  Stop doing that to me game!  Additionally, why give magic power to mundane tools like swords, axes, and pickaxes?  You can only use magic by using magic staves; if a staff has no Magic modifier, but a tool does, that'spointless!  WTF game!?The TL;DRShould you buy Magicite?  Yes, absolutely recommended, it's a game worth your purchase, but it has problems that make it more frustrating than a Roguelite should be.  Still, these problems are often mild enough that you should still be able to enjoy the game as I am, and feel that you're getting your money's worth."

Yes there are times where you start a game and an enemy is right there, ready to end your run prematurely, but the game is still in early access.Also, classes and hat's (essentially perks) have a chance to unlock as you progress deeper into the game and complete certain tasks.

Magicite is a rougue-like with elements such as a procedurally generated dungeon and perma-death. However, and even though it is not the most important part of the game, there is crafting included (cause who doesn't like crafting), and a huge variety of items to obtain. In addition to gameplay that simply makes me happy, there are also many perks like races, hats, and companions that are unlockable.For a fun game with cute graphics and challenging gameplay, this is DEFINATELY worth 10 bucks."

Your attacks are very laggy, so getting hit while attacking means waiting for seconds before you can actually attack. Enemies also get i-frames, but they have contact damage during said i-frames. Enemies have attack animations, but always do contact damage even from behind. Enemies get knocked back by your character, but the knockback is ambiguous.Jumps and aerial movement don't have tight controls, and the character moves with the gusto of a cement mixer."

Description telling about muliplayer and I think this is the best option to beat this game.For solo it became a challenge. You will die. You will die nearly everytime and every small step in this game motivates you to try it again....or frustrates you because you suck at this game like me.You want to reach more after you were punished by a small fail. Did I say this is a rouge-like game? It is.You die, you start again.You begin with a simple race but you will unlock more through small achievements like killing an amount of monsters.Those races start with different items and different specialisations. (ATT, HP, MAG. DEX)Give it a nice accessory with a bonus like dealing more dmg and the dying begins.I am disappointed that most characters are unlocked by beating the game.Beating this game? Impossible for a casual player who is not in rouge-like games and plays solo.Recommendation: Play it with others. More fun.It is a time killer.In my opinion you rely too much on RGM (random generated maps).Your first forest map can have a lot of stone or none...or you spawn in front of the biome boss....or you die of a lot of aggressive monsters because you are a warrior in your hearth and you want all of those XP....or you spawn in front of two biome bosses. Yep. I had 3 of them once.Every dungeon is random generated. You will always begin with a new challenge and you won‘t get bored.I forgot to mention that you can craft by combinating stuff you harvest and collect.Either you start lucky as an one eyed orc in a forest full of stones or not.(His starting item is a weapon and a pickaxe so u cannot collect wood at the beginning)You need to climb 20(!!!) stages to kill the end boss but first you will see different biomes with different bosses and monsters there and if you thought your last map was „wtf“, your next map will be „omg wtf“.You want progression, you will get it death by death. You will learn and become better.Anyway...This game has a lack of balance and I had a few bugs, like my arrows went through mobs.I would recommend to buy this game when it is on sale and you are really into rouge-like.As a casual I would not play it unless you are with friends."

Game requires quite a bit of skill and fast reflexes to play. It's a shame that most rare loot comes from the golden chests so when playing single player it's a very good choise to pick up lockpick trait.I like the chance to trait system, when you can now pick the traits you want and you don't have to spend ton of time rerolling for the desired result. I think they should same kind system for the stats, because basically if you want to play to ranger you get dex and hp, mag and hp for wizard and att and hp for warrior. Having a pool of 18 choises for stats is also too small to make it more 'random' when choosing stats for your character.

A friend and I started out with no knowledge of the game and died instantly a dozen times in a row, but that's part of the learning.  It was satisfying to progress through and figure out the crafting, and eventually we got to level 11 with some diamondite armor before quitting.But the online play seems to always run into connectivity issues somewhere along the way.  One person would start dropping through the world and not be able to see any other characters, or they couldn't be revived, or items would de-sync and duplicate.  If two players pressed a portal at the same time, we would skip a zone every single time.  We had to agree on who would activate portals to avoid any issues.Since this game has NO saves and makes it very challenging to make any progress at all, the fact that the networking breaks constantly is a huge deal-breaker.

Basically, you'll need to craft some thing with materials you collect from the world around and use them to kill the enemies to get to the end of a randomly generated level. You then move on to the next level and if you die you have to start all over again. It's basic roguelike material but it involves a crafting system and a terraria-like combat system.

The game is way too grindy for my liking and It gets boring after a few hours of gameplay since It's the same garbage all over again.-But, I'd still recommend the game since It's a fun challenging rougelike RPG-"

A quick look at game previews would have you thinking this is a rogue-like with a deep crafting system like Minecraft.Except the crafting is anything but deep.  For example, after crafting a bow and a net string becomes useless (neither items seem to degrade). This means by about 10 districts in, most crafting items are vendor trash, and all you are really searching for is diamonite.And about the districts. They're repetetive. Like, really repetetive. All the different biomes make very little differnce when you're ploughing through the same old reskinned enemies and boring platforming sections. Sure the later ones are really hard, but thats only because the enemies cheat by travelling in and out of the scenery.I understand that this game was only programmed by one person.

However, there is one reason why I cannot recommend this game: There is no save feature. I love rogue-likes and permadeath, but not having a save feature does not impact the difficulty of the game, only the functionality.This is especially annoying when it comes to multiplayer. Rarely do I have 1+ hours to sit at my computer playing a game nonstop. For this game, you would be forced to work this out between yourselves, limiting what you could actually accomplish. It doesn't make sense that you wouldn't include such a feature, since the game has prebuilt towns that would make a perfect save point.All-in-all, if you have the time to invest multiple hours in succession, this game seems to be very enjoyable. If you are like me, however, and do not have such freedom with your time, it would be a shame to invest in this game."

Heaps of fun! ^^Play it together with friends in case you are a beginner in rogue-like games to make it easier.Though I must say this game replay value is not that high if you already found the best possible method to clear the game or maybe the most powerful companion such as flame of hope (gives 1 additional point to all stats per level).Actually me and my friend (2 players) finished the game in 3 hours of gameplay after we understand (with trial and errors of course) the game more, then after that we can kill the boss easily multiple times (becomes repetitive), for example: greatsword is not that good for fighting bosses since it's slow though it has range, sword & arrow is the best weapon in-game for bosses or mobs. There are only few crafts that are useful for you to progress in-game like potions, pickaxe, etc.Expect to die multiple times in the beginning, other than that HAVE FUN!! ^^"

The only issue I had is the creator made the game so random that when you started it was either super hard or really easy to get through,m and when you went into a town and came to the next section it could be really hard or really easy again. no real buildup of difficulty, and when you died there was no lives, theres no "" load at the last place you saved"" Your character and the hours of work you put into it just litterally Vanish, and you start at ground one again.The only winner for me was that does add to the atari nostalgia, when all games where like that. and the fact when you Start over you have a chance of unlocking new things to power yourself up before you even play, making it easier and easier even on hard settings. I'm sure after I unlock a few more items and Companion NPCs it'll be a blast grin emoticon But I wasn't in the mood for it so I switched to a sure fire fun of nintendo and now I""m playing Mario 3D land till I go to sleep.overall I'd give it a 5 out of 10 fun arcade feel, awesome graphics even if it was eight bit, it was very pretty with the glowing essence on important material items around you and the enemies where unique to this style of gaming. It didn't have a storyline, but it left you to build your own. You can craft your weapons. but sadly the one death and you reset makes it hard to want to make the bigger better weapons early with the limited resources and high kill rate. but a great time killer and Nostalgia trip of the old Atari boxes and beeps and boops to match and pleasing background music. But Its way to randomized and Not enough animals on the map to keep even a hunger boosted player satiated long enough unless you gunned through a level, which kills the mood and also risks that One death and gone stats way to much. It's cool to make a game hard but when you have easy parts and a set span of time based on your characters hunger and no real way to fordge on the run or do anything to emurse yourself in the world around you. It becomes a pain to play. And removes alot of game values and reasons we play them.Personally I was very displeased with the placing in the game, the random mode of hardness to super easy and randomized boss fights? It's like someone blew up terriaria and held the fun hostage. But the nostalgia trip in the 8 bit world and clap to the artists of the game are what give it the 5."

But if you're just starting out, your chances of unlocking anything are pretty small.  After you die if you hit certain milestones you get reward chests that are random.  Your chances of getting nothing but meaningless points are pretty high. Once you start unlocking races you have an increased chance of unlocking visual skins for those races. But if you don't get something you want, better hop back in.  So you'll be stuck with the basic intro level crap for a long time.  After 20+ hours I have one race that actually makes things a little easier.  The rest are pointless.Everything is random. The levels are procedural. The loot in towns is random.  Enemies are random.  I went through an entire stage of nothing but harmless pigs and trees.  If you don't start with an axe, there's a decent chance you wont ever get one and will be stuck bashing enemies heads in with a porkchop.  Which is entertaining once.  Once.  Your abilities are mostly random. It's a toss up whether or not you get something useful.It's fun for a little bit. If it's on sale it's worth a few hours. But beyond that it's just aggrivating."
76561197961218844,Recommended,268750,19763451,"Posted: 18 December, 2015",all,Ailingforale,"More Reviews @TheVideogameBacklog.comMagicite was the lurker on my Wishlist (which is 189 games long now) and (somewhat) recently it went on a pretty sweet sale so I picked up the four-pack with some friends and I in mind. It had become a drug that I couldn’t kick and I had to get my fix almost nightly with one or two friends of course. Sharing is caring, right?That’s not to say that Magicite isn’t a good single player game, but you know how some games are just more fun with other people? Well… this is “kind of” one of those games. I think, as opposed to some games where one mode stands out above the other, Magicite’s single and multiplayer modes have completely different feels and both want and get my attention.When playing solo, you’ve got a bit more inventory management to deal with since everything is harvested and crafted by yourself. You can sell everything that doesn’t pertain to your build and get a decent bit money with some good speed. While running solo there’s no potions to split and there are no boar butts flying into your face after your buddies hit them in the face(the struggle is real). If you’re playing with three or more people, the inventory management gets pretty complicated with people arguing about whether or not “we should get the diamond upgrade first” or “what ore are we on with arrows, are we sure were done with rock arrows?” It takes us a long time in every town, but when playing with buds, it’s all fun. If I was playing Magicite with other people (read: online multiplayer servers), I think I wouldn’t enjoy the experience much, if at all.While you get no support, the enemy AI acts funky when more than one person is on the screen. Bees are probably the worst offenders with their juking a completely different direction and hitting you. When you’re solo, it’s fairly easy to guess where most enemies are going to go. The boar is the one mob that has set up a melee = “solo only” policy with my buds and I. Hitting them knocks them back and a boar butt in the face has been known to be the kill-shot many times. All the mages and their casted magic can also cause some problems, but mostly if you’re melee. If you’re ranged, it’s not that difficult.Each of the three modes of combat feel good, but they are not all equal. Like I’ve mentioned already, ranged is kind of like an “easy mode”. Once you’ve compiled a large enough some of arrows, you can just let them fly and not have a care while you go and frolic through all the loot there is to pick up. Magery can come off similarly, but with a perk. You can fire your Fire spell a little slower than one can shoot arrows, but fire goes through walls. (Whatever science; this is magic we’re dealing with here!) The issue with both is that sometimes getting the components necessary to build your arrows or your magic sticks can be more difficult in some runs than in others. That can be a great source of frustration because you can’t have easy arrow mode, if you can’t make a bow… or arrows.Melee doesn’t tend to have that issue of ammo. You can always hit an enemy with something or if you are, for some reason or another, completely out of something to hit bad guys with, you can punch them. Melee is satisfying, but feels the most challenging. It’s tough to fight some monsters with their quirky movements or the fact that some just move faster than you. (I’m looking at you bats in the spider cave! … jerks…) Put that together with the two-handed weapons needing a sense wind-up timing and you can see where the going gets tough.Score: GewdMagicite is possibly the game I would say you need to play if you want to have some good co-op fun with three buds. Even the single player has a place in my heart, even if I don’t enjoy the experience as much. Sure there are some single player games that do the platforming genre a little better, but with all the elements included in Magicite, this is a game that deserves to be in your library. Definitely money well spent."

Especially fun with some extra players.When Magicite was recommended to me, it was pitched as being like Spelunky with a little crafting peppered in. Obviously, this pitch was made by a friend who knows how much I'd played Spelunky when it was still in beta. It's not far off, though. The game is about tearing through randomly generate levels to progressivly harder sets of stages, collecting treasures and upgrades to help you make it to the end of the game, all with a very small health pool and extremely limited forms of recovery. And, yes, it is fun!However, Magicite is far from a polished experience. First of all, I think it grasps the wrong end of the roguelike stick entirely. A big part of what makes roguelikes fun is the randomness; you never know if you're going to get a great set of equipment and throw it all away in hubris or struggle to keep alive at the razors edge of your wits because the game dealt you an awful hand for your class of choice. Add crafting immediately cuts down on this immensely; because crafting lets you design the direction your build will go. You know you're going to get a usable setup, at least, because you created it. Other than that, there are bugs-a-plenty, especially in multiplayer, and a lot of what makes you keep trying, the different classes, hats, and companions you get as rewards from different kinds of runs, range from irrelevent to horribly game-breaking. For example, the companion you get from beating the game once spits out random items from time to time, but it seems to choose from every item the game has and with equal weight. We found it would often barf up end-game equipment in the very first level. Amusing, but not exactly well-balanced.I would recommend this game to people who like challenging games, but find the randomness of true roguelikes frustrating, and have at least one friend to play with (and a decent understanding of Hamachi). It is fun if you can find it in yourself to overlook the roughness in its design."

As it currently stands (july 2014), you lose everything with each death and are put into a new world. You lose your XP, your items, everything you've crafted, and the world itself. This might be fine, except that I die *all*the*time*. It is terribly frustrating, and takes away a lot of the fun. Some games make it easy to get back into the game after each death, but with a crafting game, I want something to last.The game's still in development, so they'll probably address this flaw with the game, but as it is now I can't recommend the game."

Unless you spend your entire game avoiding everything you will not survue and theres no reall chance of it. The devs need to balance out the power of the levels.

Meaning that you will be fighting dungeons full of monsters (I mean FULL) at about lvl 10. And you get there pretty fast.

The unlocking system only allows extremely shallow boosts to the randomly generated levels and really tedious cosmetic changes. In the game you have an extremely boring crafting system that only looks deep at first glance, it gives you little health so whatever progress you make is entirely wiped with the random spawning of a tough enemy. When you die, it will present you with four chests which can unlock the outside boosts for your character, but since all the unlocks are chance based, they're just minor boosts to your score which are entirely irrelevant because the game doesn't track them.This game inflates itself spending time to unlock the outside bonuses which are necessary to progress, while it will take a long time to complete, you'll have a very difficult time enjoying it with it's snail pace."

Considering when you die you have to go through the crafting motions again (even as simplistic as it is).Gameplay is a bit bland, the levels, ""traps"", enemies, very samey. Multiplayer is buggy and it just makes the game harder (less resources for each player).I may enjoy this more if the crafting system just listed the items you could make out of the objects in your inventory. Or, better yet. . . Once you figured out a crafting recipe, it would be saved for future runs, and you could just quick-make it when you got the materials. It would still require figuring things out, but take away all the tedium for future runs.I'm just not all that compelled to keep playing it. Games of this kind usually keep me occupied for hours and hours. I wish I didn't waste money on this. I want my five bucks back - It was on sale. I don't think it's worth even that. Then again, my own fault, just figured I'd buy it on a whim. The sparkley bit graphics enticed me right away. I'm a sucker for pixel art + pretty lighting. The ever popular rogue-like elements, a bit of crafting, and platforming sounded like something I'd like right of the bat.Maybe with more updates it'll become better.

You have very little inventory space so when you have to spread the ingredients on the inventory to craft, most of the time, you don't have the room in your inventory! The map generations are bland. always moving from left to right and always ledges and jumping and stuff. And the game is god damn difficult! I haven't beaten it once. Its harder than the first binding of isaac, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that saying a ton. The bosses are all overpowered except the first one you usually find. Hell, one of the bosses in the forest deals 4 damage. And since you always start in the forest, running into this guy is a death trap. its over! just quit the game and restart. theres no point in fighting it so early on. And the characters are pretty much all the same. Along with the enemies. only difference with most enemies is that they have different art or are more powerful, and the thing with the characters is they have different art, items and special skills (such as if they are good with melee, ranged, or magic.). Its not worth the 10 dollars unless you like buying games that cost that much and dying in the first 2 minutes. Have fun dying kids! Oh, not to mention that 4 enemies come and kill you instantly in 5 minutes if you don't get out by then. They can also fly and go through walls. plus they are fast and will most definetly kill you.

,Not Recommended,268750,13175808,"Posted: 30 November, 2014",all,Mechanos -CD-,"I feel the videos and description of this game are very misleading.  The game is basically a hybrid between a platformer and a bullet heII game, with some random RPG filler content.  Gameplay consists of trying to make it as far as possible through randomly generated stages, and seeing how many ""achievements"" you can complete before you die.  There is no persistance and no saving your game when you haven't died.  Yes, I went into the game expecting ""permanent death"".  But not being able to save my progress when I haven't died was a serious bummer.  Same with there being a timer on every single level.  I went in expecting something akin to a hardcore terraria focused more on platforming and leveling instead of digging, and instead I got Contra with 1 life and no continues lol.Putting my being mislead bias aside and just playing the game for what it's worth, there are other mechanics that didn't quite sit well with me.The first being, the unlock system.  When you die, 0 to 4 chests will be displayed on the death screen.  I still haven't figured out what decides how many you get.  Anyway, you click each enabled chest, and it will give you any unlocks/challenges you've completed, or add a handful of points to your final score.  Here's the rub.  Unlike some games of this genre (FTL comes to mind), most of the unlocks have a very low chance of even unlocking.  For instance, one or two of the easier race unlocks require killing 15 monsters before dying, just to enable a 20% chance of unlocking it at the death screen.  20 percent!  For me, this turned into a 2 hour grind, repeatedly doing the same thing over and over, hoping to unlock something new to give me an easier start, only to have bad luck determine my 2 hours were wasted.  When I finally did unlock a couple new races and a ""hat"", their bonuses were pretty miniscule and ultimately left me feeling like they wouldn't help me much in further playthroughs.Secondly, the constant feeling of being rushed.  When I first jumped into the game, I wasn't using a wiki and was playing blind.  Right off the bat, I was starving trying to figure out crafting combinations.  I start Googling looking for a wiki, start testing some crafting..  suddenly I'm being told I need to leave the level because the evil surface monsters are coming to get me.  About the 5th time it told me that (during another playthrough), I decide ok, I saw some awesome looking things in the trailer videos, lets see if we can fight the evil empire like we did in FTL!  ....nope.  Giant purple heads hit me for 9999something damage, despite me having like 10 hp lol.  I understand this is an intentional part of the gameplay, but as a new player (and even after playing a couple hours) I found this mechanic to be more annoying than fun.Lastly, the crafting and inventory management.  The game has no level persistance and you have to keep moving to avoid hunger and the death timer, yet you have to stop and decide what items you want to keep or throw away/sell, manage durability, craft new tools just to progress each taking many clicks (make 2 piles of sticks, combine for first handle, combine with stick again for 2nd handle, combine stick with planks instead for sword handle, combine ores/bone/wood and such just to create a single useable material, only to require combining 2-4 of those materials for blades or 3-6 for armors...yeah.  It's just surprisingly time consuming for a game where you just lose everything soon as you die anyway.  With no in-game recipe list and no way to make crafting new weapons/tools faster, it feels like a massive speed bump slowing down otherwise fast paced gameplay.If the game had some sort of persistant..  sandboxy...  whatever type mode, that could take advantage of the RPG/Rogue-like aspects and crafting, I would likely have 0 complaints.  Even if said persistant mode kept the permanent death (Don't Starve for example.  FTL also, to a lesser extent).  The graphics/music are both pleasant, and the fighting itself was responsive enough to be enjoyable.I'm also annoyed at the comment that this game was influenced by a game like Monster Hunter, where 99% of the gameplay is 'permanently' upgrading your character with new equipment, crafted from rare items procured from complex and sometimes extremely difficult enemies.  I don't consider grinding for a chance to start a new run with slightly elevated stats, the same thing kek.  Just not for me I suppose."

There is no reason whatsoever to not have ingame chat in multiplayer!Also relying on Hamachi for multiplayer setup isn't a solution, it's a stopgap, and given how awful P2P connections tend to be outside of South Korea, it's akin to trying to keep a severed limb on with scotch tape. In addition, now that Hamachi requires registration to use any features at all, it's no longer a viable option in lieu of an actual integrated multiplayer service.Also screw boars forever."

They all had strategy, time to think, and not based on how fast you can jump around the screen.There is no ""building up"" your character, inventory, craft or any of the things that makes the genre great if your character & everything he has is gone the moment you leave the game.Perhaps this is a fun multiplayer game.

However, it does have the early access balance issues that make it a waster of time to play at this stage.

Dev needs to add a filter to prevent mobs from generating within a certain distance from spawn point, or at least allow a player to get started. Multiple times I have been attacked by the wasp/bee creature or a boar (?) within seconds after starting, even before I had a chance to gather any resources.Overall, this game will eventually be a fun and enjoyable game. However, as of April 5, 2014, the game is too difficult to play, which will be off-putting for many players.

Definitely not the best I've played, but it's definitely good!PROS:- Fun!- Skill-based combat that depends more on your ability to dodge and time attacks rather than how good your gear is (but the latter still matters).- Plenty of unlockables.- Lots of different enemy types and designs.- Dynamic progression system (I.E. mix-and-match your own sets of gear, do you wanna be an archer, a warrior, a mage, or some frankenstein abomination inbetween? Your choice.)- Pretty good graphics!CONS:- Boring level design, is hardly vertical at all and is 90% horizontal action.- The inventory and crafting systems have some things left to be desired...- Tells you literally nothing about what anything does, except for characters and gear.- Infrequent updates.- The RNG, in classic rogue-like fashion, can totally screw you over.- Why do most of the unlocks have percentage chances of being unlocked?!Either way, get this game. It's pretty good!"

I don't know what was promised to kickstarter people or whatever, but the fact of the matter is, this is a nice little game. Grab two or three friends and maybe  a few alcoholic beverages and get with it.  As it were, I cannot get enough of this game.PROS:Rougelike + multiplayer; it is surprisingly hard to find rogulelikes with good multiplayer.Addictive: The levels and enemies change enough that each playthrough is just as challenging as the last. Sometimes you have to adapt your tactics because you couldn't find enough magic loot, sometimes you have way too much magic♥♥♥♥♥♥  Each playthrough is a new challenge.Buggy:  Yeah bugs can be annoying at time, but honestly, most of the bugs we encountered were hilarious. Enemies launching themselves into the air at us using our allies downed bodies, and shops randomly opening when we hit the W key while in a dungeon were some of the more hilarious and sometimes useful ones.Humor: There are a few fun little humorous easter eggs in the game.  Nothing says fun like TPK in a village safe zone because got a little too greedy with the village livestock.Stuff: Theres lots of stuff in there, collectable stuff, races, hats, companions, hair-dos. And most of them benefit you in some way. Got a little ghost thing that lets me jump and infinite amount of times. That thing right there is the♥♥♥♥♥♥Challenging: This game isn't for the light hearted. Get ready to die. A lot. Often right at the beginning. However, once you get going, you're usually golden, until somthing stupid happens and the entire party wipes because one person got downed in a bad spot.Short: -ish? You can beat a playthrough in an hour if you're quick about it.  There's even an unlockable for it.CONS:Buggy:  Yeah some of the bugs were fun, but some were a little frustrating, like being instakilled for landing on a mob just the right way, but honestly, just don't directly on top of mob's heads. This is Super Mario Brothers.  Italian is not a race available for play.  There is not plumber hat.  There is not skinny brother companion. Forget about it.Content: There is a nice bit of content in this game, but it would be nice to see more. However, I have no idea what the developer has planned for this game. If they just want to bug fix and call it a day, or actually continue adding stuff.Overall, solid game. I hope to see much more come out of this game and from this developer."

I love this game so much so far and am looking forward to more content in the future!Magicite is a game where you are set on a quest to go through multiple levels (forests, caves, swamps, you name it). On this quest, you do things like; chop trees, mine rocks, kill pigs and most importantly craft tools and items for your adventure.You level up and gain gold by killing monsters. With levels you can gain extra HP, attack power, magic, and stamina. All of these atributes are important on your journey. With gold, you can of course purchase things from shop keepers. These shop keepers are found at the end of each level and can sell you very important (but randomly generated) items.Beware, each level has a time limit that isn't even shown. At some point when you're going through the level (if you've been there for a bit too long), these enemies called ""The Scourge"" will invade the level. You are to run away as quickly as possible to the end of the level before they catch up, because no matter what they WILL kill you in one single hit.I recommend picking up this game immediately!"

Controls are easy to figure out.The game features in game awards by unlocking new accessories and characters once certain criteria are met.  Games are timed by sending in the main enemy, ""the Scourge"" if one does not get through a level in the timely fashion.  Oddly enough, the game encourages the player to cheat by asking the player to enter a cheat code to unlock one of the characters, which personally, I can't really support.The game also has several strange bugs that exist.  I've seen players upon entering a town area be spawned in the ground.  Should this happen to you, move around consistantly until you fall through the floor.  It should cause you to respawn in the correct area.  Additionally, one can spam ""W"" upon entering a door and one can skip levels...including the boss's level and make the game endless, even through the game does not spawn anymore creatures apparently.Overall, the game is quite a bit of fun for simple gaming.

,Recommended,268750,13728968,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,Some Guy,"tldr Great game with good mechanics, however can be tough at times.Magicite is your not-so-typical Rogue-like side scroller. The game takes place underground and your goal is to escape by crafting using the resources available...and going deeper. Each level you go into is procedurally generated, meaning no two playthroughs are alike. There are plenty of different biomes to discover, each one with its own mobs, traps, and loot. However, the further you explore the tunnels of Magicite, the tougher enemies get and the more unforgiving the game becomes.The thing that makes Magicite a not-so-typical game is mainly its customization. Starting the game you have one species unlocked, 2 varients for that species, no hats, and no pets. To unlock things you need to complete their asigned challenges, which can vary from getting to lvl 5 to completing the game without getting hit once. These hats, pets, and especially spieces can change the way you play the game immensely.The skill system is interesting too. Your characters skills and abilities are ""random"". Your 4 skills are health, strength, dexterity, and magic. It may not seem like much, but magicite does it in a way where it doesn't have to be. Your health is important to all playing types, but the other three are what's really important. Dexterity increases your movement speed, the amount of dashes you have, and your damage with a bow. Strength indicates how much damage you do with the various amount of melee weapons available to you. And magic is responsible for the amount of mana you have and damage you do with staffs and other magic related weapons.There are, however, some issues that need to be addressed. For one, some enemies have a very anoying attack strategy, called bouncing around like they don't know what they're doing. Also, some enemies seem very out of place. By that, I'm not saying that that they don't look right, I mean their stats are not right; specifically boars. They have an unreasonable amount of health to be anywhere in the starting biome, and they charge at you like a madman!Final Verdict:Pros.-Good crafting system-Beautiful level generation-Procedurally generated-Charming-Good progression-Separation between playing styles (as in mage isnt just warrior with a staff)-Challenging, but not to the point of rage quit-Extremely intricate customization options!-Casual and Try-Hard friendlyCons.-A few things feel unbalancedOverall.9.4/10 Excellent!"

The Scourge mechanic keeps the game fast paced, and the difficulty, albeit frustrasting sometimes, keeps the game fun, especially with friends. However. The game feels unfinshed. There are some very simple things, I feel, that could be done that would make this game so much better, and although I respect an independant developer, this game needs work.1. Character selection is a boring clickfest. Being able to choose your charcter build may seems standard gameplay, but not in this case. I spend a good two minutes sometimes looking for the right combination of starting stats and abilites for a day's runs. I get being random and crazy can be fun, but it should be an option, not a forced default.2. Magic doesn't scale. The gems themselves are even named *insert element* gem mark 1. what happened after that? There is no way to upgrade your staves in the way the archer and warrior based builds can with higher level ores and thier swords and arrows respectivly.3. Axes become useless after your first stack of wood and sticks. There's no incentive to keep chopping trees besides selling the wood for gold, which becomes meaningless after you've outpaced the shops, which is a lot of the time unfourtunatley.4. Items hold no value. There is no differnece to the trader between an actual rock and a painstakingly crafted gold helmet. every itme in the game sells for what looks like 1-3 gold. Doesn't make sense really . . .As it stands, Magicite is a pretty good game. It has great potential but needs some final touches to make it truly great. At some times it feels like this game is still in beta, and judging by the attitude of the developer, a Mr. Sean Young, it looks as though it will remain that way."

,Recommended,268750,13619187,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,boerema,"I have really enjoyed this game so far and would definitely recommend it to my friends. I've only played single player thus far, so my review can only be associated with that.The game itself is fairly simple. You start out being able to make a single type of character and unlock more as complete certain feats throughout additional playthroughs. You characters are semi-random as they have attributes that are generated when you start a game. If you don't like it, you can go back to the main menu and generate new random attributes.You first play through a dungeon where there are monsters, trees, and minerals. You have to have an ax to chop down trees and a pick to mine minerals. Swords give you attack bonuses. The monsters are well designed. Each has an idiom that is the key to defeating it if you can time your attacks and movements correctly. After each dungeon, you enter a small town where you can smelt minerals and buy items you may not be able to craft.Which brings us to crafting. Using your items you pick up in the dungeon, you can craft new swords, axes, pick, armor, etc. I'm not a huge fan of the ""Figure out the crafting recipes on your own"" (use the internet) crafting, but that is fine. It provides a good balance to the gameplay that each character starts with specific items which may not provide you with everything you need to get by, so you will need to either craft or purchase the rest. For example, the cyclopse rase starts with a sword and pick, but no ax, so you need to go through one dungeon picking up materials and coins so you can buy an ax the next time through which will allow you to begin your crafting adventures.The monsters get progressively more difficult as you go. Some are very tricky indeed. Learning to use the skills you gain as your level up is important. Crafting better and better items, including armor, also becomes important if you want to make it out alive. Also, as always, attacking chickens in town is possible, but not recommended.Excellent game."

Even then, this game does so much things correctly to the point where you don't care that the final boss in Magicite is a rip off of Terraria's. The Crafting system is simple but complicated; you don't even have to craft, kill, or gather resources to win the game, the only thing holding you back is your own skill; and the challenges to obtain new content aren't annoying and tedious, they are enjoyable, and even if you fail, it doesn't feel like you have, it just feels like you're playing a new game that was better than the previous one.

You MUST leave the room, disconnecting everyone (who just spent 10 minutes to find stats + traits)* You can start the game even if your friends hasn't finished to create their characterI just played for 45 minutes, took a red door, did my stuff in the village, took the red door again, and after a screen glitch I got teleported to the dungeon-village (WTF). When I spawned in the dungeon, there was a very big boss with the ability to oneshot me, right in front of me, with no possibility to escape.Conclusion: This game is not so bad, you can play it and enjoy it, but when you'll know it a little better, you'll get easily bored, and tired because of the bugs and bad game design choices."

It takes everything you love about Terraria, adds a lot more, and bundles it all up into a nice squishy ball called Magicite.Pros:-Smooth gamepley-Seamless Multiplayer-Environment feels bright and colorful-Runs amazingly on ANY computer, slow or not-Unique crafting experience-Well done skill systemCons:-High prices in low level shops-Difficulty gets ramped up suddenly after stage oneNow, I wasn't sure where to put Permadeath on this list because of the fact that it can be taken both ways.

This game has outstanding music to ease the repeatedly flailing of one of, as of this review, 15 custom-trait characters through up to 20 stages per playthrough(any playthrough terminates at stage 20, the game's final boss). Twenty stages may seem like a short game map, but this is easily made up for by the extreme difficulty and highly rewarding gameplay, as well as multiplayer (I don't know specific server sizes, but my knowledge is that local multiplayer is capped at 4 total players).Magicite does have some potentially less desirable features though; the game has somewhat limited replayability after completion, especially after all 46 unlockables have been found, and the enemy-filled stages are generated in sections instead of completely random platform placement. To whomever it may apply, there is also yet to be controller support.|Note: Below section is all based on the version out at the time of review, more may be added along game development|Also note that all 15 unlockable character 'races' have unique starting traits, any of the races can wear any of the 24 unlockable 'hats', and be followed by one of 8 unlockable special 'Companions' (only one hat and companion at a time); so long as the player has met the requirements for acquiring each unlockable item and is lucky enough on percentile-based chances where they occur. Additional stat improvement can also be made in-game via crafting and wearing specialised armors, or wielding specific items."

Like almost every rouge like this game is inforgiving, but almost every death is your fault. So you can't hate the fact you died. The game has TONS of replay ability. Every time you achieve a certian task, say, mine 50 rocks, you can get a new race, follower, or hat. Which there are tons of each. And every race has their own special pros, and cons, and each hat does something different, so do the followers. And before you wonder. Everythings change makes a huge difference. Allowing you to make awesome custom sub-classes. Like playing a glass cannon? Play with alexanders spirit with the wizard beard and gorgon eye. Or maybe you like ranged combat? Djinn, archery hat, and ancient bat. Or maybe you'd like like to ♥♥♥♥ around and make your OWN scorge killing master of murder? either way. This game takes a LOT of practice and skill to even beat. There also happens to be hunger. Literally works like how hunger does in literally every other game that features it. Nothing special. There also happen to be sets of armor for each class of weapons. Do you use the bow and arrow? Get the archery set. Mage? Robe set. Though there is a bit of a bias to the melee set. Being easier to get and all. But thats beside the point. All the enemies are not very varied at all. If you killed the boars in the jungle biome, you also happen to have the ability to kill the scourglings in the final boss. The combat is fluent and there are no hitbox glitches. also, the soundtrack is B E A U T I F U L being made by one guy I am impressed with its nice soundtrack that fits the area its in perfectly 9 times out of ten! If you are a filthy casual, you are most likely not going to like its game due to its unforgiving difficulty, and the fact each run normally lasts around an hour and there be no savin! So, my final verdict:8/10 Its a great game you can get for the ten dollars (that are totally worth it by the way) that I indeed recommend to any fan of rougelikes."

It's a perfect cross between a rogue like rpg and a sandbox crafting game. The goal is simple, fight your way through level after level of monsters and bosses and try to make it to the Scourge Lair where you'll face the ultimate... Boss Wall? Throughout those levels you'll be faced with gathering food and resources in order to craft gear and items that will help you stay alive, and help you stop the monsters from staying alive. There are plenty of unlockables including, new races, hats, and pets. The soundtrack is a nice 8 bit sounding lopp that may get repetative after a while, but does change with each biome to keep it refreshing. The art style is nice, closest comparison I could give would be Terraria. The only downsides are 1) the multiplayer is fairly difficult to do, you need to port forward and it can be very hrd on your bandwidth and 2) it just doesn't have enough meat to it yet. I'm hoping the game expands a bit because as of right now I've got all the races except for one and have all the pets and hats and am not really drawn back in to play it any longer.

Trying to do everything as fast as you can before the monster shows up. The combat makes it feel like you are a piece of paper ready to be burned by even a slime making it a intense experience throughout the entire game. The artwork is wonderfull ,and i do love it.

But anyway the game quickly shows it's true colors by making you scroll through countless times of the many perks to find a pair you like. As soon as you start open the game it becomes clear that the game's intention is to slowly rip off your face with tweezers due to the fact the  you have about 4-8 health at level one. There is no easy way to regain health in magicite, the only way is to equip a companion (you have to play to unlock everything) that heals you when you reach the end of a district. by one health. The other way is to create two kind of potions, a mysterious potion (self explanitory) or a health potion by combinging herbs. Also as your progress towards getting the diamondite you dream of, you get massive amounts of damage, up to 150 if you like melee still. Yet the developers just decided to throw another kick to your stomach by making mobs that do up to 8 damage. seriously. and they have massive amounts of health. For example, percyl from the first biome, or as I like to call him ""the penguin of death"" considering he has about 500-1000 health and does 4 damage if you let him slap you with his sword. Also the ever unforgiving developers wanted to make it so as the damage increases so does the cooldown time decreasing the attack frequency.Ignoring all the meaningless crap I said up there this is an amazing smooth playing game, so in all fairness it gets 8.9 out of ten"

This will reduce much of the dragging the mouse around.  Also allow us to combine INTO a stack, but with a max so we don't accidentally make 49 wooden planks lol.  I mean like holding shift and clicking twice on 2 refined stone to make a stone blade without having to right click and move one over. Oh and PLEASE make barehanded feasible, every time u pick something up and end up using that, say a bone, to melee, it does the same damage as barehanded but doesn't count.  So if you wanna use the hats that give you bare handed bonuses, you have to constantly open your inventory EVERY time you pick something up =/Thanks,ChrisI seriously ♥♥♥♥ing love this game lol..

The crafting system does feel a bit out of place for the game. In the very first level, it's most important to gather materials for a pick and/or net, and harvest ore and bugs. There's no in game guidance for how to craft various necessary items. This wouldn't be a problem except that all levels are on a 5 minute timer, after which you die pretty quickly. This creates an initial artificial bump in the learning curve that really doesn't need to be there.Things I really liked: enemies have set patterns, so you can do better at the game through personal experience and skill vs. just leveling up; melee weapons have a 'windup' time, so you need to properly time your attacks; all the character options are pretty fun.Looking forward to trying multiplayer with some friends."

I bought this game so that I could play with my friend, only to find out that you needed hamachi in order to connect to each other, even though this was never stated in the trailer!I didnt find this game much of a problem untill I found another game by smashgames that looks almost identical but it looks much more polished and has guns and jetpacks and interesting boss battles.So my suggestion is, save your money. Buy the other game that smash battles has made which is supposed to be a billion times better."

I can say that this game is one of the most fun single player experiences i have ever played. The game has some of the most unique, colourful and cute graphics in any game ever. The combat is never about great equipment (mostly) and more about movement and tactics. The bosses are fun and a challenge all while keeping you entertained and wanting to play. The game has very interesting and great looking districts as well as an assortment of different armours, weapons and tools.A couple down sides to the game are the fact that most of the enemies are re-skins of the first enemies with some skins adding more damage. Another down side is the lack of options for video or audio, apart from resolution. Another thing i recommend you tweak is the random spawn of bosses, sometimes i spawn in with nothing and a giant boss is right there to welcome me to the game."

It's brutally hard at the beginning, and all of the unlocks can keep that type of difficulty going (if you're a completionist!).The game consists of various races trying to beat the ""Scourge"", which is basically anything evil and purple. To win, you must survive 19 zones, with the 20th being an all out timed live-or-die boss fight. Getting past three stages, let alone 19, without knowing what you're doing, crafting recipes, and melee reach with various items is pretty much impossible, though. Of these 19 zones, there are around 9 biomes, although in all honesty 2 are almost required to be skipped in order to have a good run (Volcano and Crater; the loot and xp from Dungeon and Spider far outweight the risks if you have ranged attacks).One of the key mechanics is the Scourge being able to infiltrate a zone after around 5-6 minutes, causing the player to either run like hell towards the exit or die trying. If one of the three scourge monsters hit you, you die. This may seem like a crippling mechanic, but in all honesty as long as you don't waste time you'll seldom deal with it, and you have roughly 1 minute to escape before one of them catches up to you.The ability to decide how you want to play is based around 5 values; the race you pick, the hat you wear, the companion you pick, and the stats / traits pair you (re)roll.Races deal primarily with what items you start the run with, along with minor stat increases / decreases.Hats have drastically different effects across the board. It's impossible to list them all without taking half a page of text.Companions deal with mechanics more than stats; levelling up, health, and speed can be modified, to say without spoilers.Stats are randomly assigned to a character, and can be rerolled at the start screen for another set of randoms. HP deals with your overall health, ATK (Attack) for your melee damage (sword and fist alike), DEX (Dexterity) increases arrow damage from bows, and MAG (Magic) increases your magic damage and overall mana pool.Traits are randomly given when you reroll stats. Each runs has you start with 2, and depending on how you roll, each can be incredibly valuable for your playstyle. My personal favorites are Locksmith and Potions Master. I find that good traits trump good starting stats, but I'm sure others will disagree to an extent.Races, Hats, and Companions are unlocked by satisfying varying criteria, from beating certain bosses to gathering various materials or killing enough monsters, to beating the game in various ways.My biggest gripe with the game is OTI, or ""Oh, that's it?"", the phenomenon that happens when you think a game'll have a lot more content than it does. I've played for about 13 hours and have beaten the game twice, I've crafted pretty much every item ingame that I can, and other than unlocking the insanely hard or RNG-based (20% chance when doing certain criteria, etc) hats, races, and companions, I'm pretty much done. My biggest complaints are:The early game feels more like fighting to get better gear, versus fighting to beat the game. Without the Regen Fairy and Brawler's Scarf, there's virtually no way for a newbie to progress.Certain playstyles are incredibly superior to others. Ranger is the easiest way to beat the game the first time around with the right choices (Looking at you, Dwelf), whereas melee and magic are horribly reliant on careful health management and certain unlocks, such as mana regen vs just crafting bone / stone arrows.Potion Master is almost required to beat the game. 50% chance to get 2.5x the effect on your potions is a maker-or-breaker for a run. I think the same for gold chests unlocks(So many powerful tools for all types), but others disagree.The game is put on the back-burner until Roguelands, another title from the Devs, is 1.0, at least unless Magicite gets enough hype to warrant progression beforehand. This, along with the fact that Magicite is past 1.0, screams the risk that Magicite might be left as is. I had to warn ya, potential buyer.Risk of Rain is the same price, also goes on sale for like $2.50, and is fantastic as hell. I love both, don't get me wrong, but if you want any story or powerup mania, this game isn't it. All you get is ""We were forced underground, go kill those scourge"".Co-op takes Hamachi or Port Forwarding; if you can't / dont want to do either, sorry about your luck.Sometimes bosses don't like you and decide to spawn really early into a game. You can still beat them without waking the scourge, but it's a bit of a pain.Trailer isn't the same as current version; there is no magicite in it yet, despite blacksmith w/ shiny thing.This might seem too much to handle, but think of the pros:It's really damn fun to play. Solo gives you a taste, but co-op can lead to some insane hilarity, especially when you see a certain chicken make a friend go from 8 to 0 hp in two seconds flat. Co-op also lets you do some fun strats and unlock things at the same time, so it's great to pick up the 4-pack on sale. I'm glad I did.The difficulty is great to start out with, and (despite critics) I like the crafting system; it's simple.You can kill nothing, kill everything, grab everything, basically ignore everything and technically can still beat the final boss despite however you played. Diamondite pickaxe would be a must, though, as well as absurd dodging skills.It's a mixed blessing, but I've always been the sort to buy into the hope that dev progress will occur; I'd love to see expansions with bosses at floor 30 or 50, especially considering that I thought we were crusading to save the overworld.Experimentation feels real in this game. Every death feels to really be my fault, and knowledge really is power in this game.Outside Help: Crafting guide is pretty necessary the first time around, as picks / axes / swords aren't the most obvious to craft. If you don't feel like checking yourself, the basics are this: Combine sticks together until you get the desired base, then combine ore bars (or wooden planks) until you get a blade, which you combine with the base. Sword bases are a plank and a stick. Bows are combing webs into string, then string with an unfinished bow (sticks added together), and magic is 2 of 1 bug for a gem and the gem with a stick. Net for getting bugs is 2 string together then combine resulting net with stick. Left click to grab bugs when you see em.Keys to know: Escape for general menu, R for inventory.Either way the devs go, I've had a good time, and I have a feeling this game could keep me interested for a lot longer."

YES there are a couple multiplayer issues such as when you travel between screens if your friend enters first they fall forever or are glitched momentarily but really if someone crafts the items everyone needs and exits its fine and it only happens mabye every 5 games or so for me but neeeeever had any other issues except i use hamachi and my computer is not high end lol kinda old has trouble runnin minecraft mods n such so i call it my home potato anywaaayss. All in all magicite is a damn great game simple in some ways but it can really keep you busy for an hour or 2 and the multiplayer is fantastic just my personal opinion though iv heard the game has manyyy problems for other less practiced people so i wouldnt recommend this game for people who are not cautious cause sometimes it will backstab the♥♥♥♥♥♥outa you -.- so yeah good all around game very fun multiplayer and a very enjoyable concept the design isnt bad too simple as iv said but decent compared to some games that cost quadruple the cash and end up suckin balls or screwin ya over in the long run with some stupid dlc that HAS to be downloaded likkkkkee destiny it was a funnnn game but damn did they ♥♥♥♥ a couple people over. sorry long winded 0.0 and abit of a randomness. magicite good game, good concept, abit buggy like any other game but if you feel like a roguelite this will kill time and give some fun"

It was released in 2014, two years after Rogue Legacy, and three years after Binding Isaac and Terraria.Magicite itself fits well into the genre of the above games; it has simple art and crafting like Terraria, and the permadeath of Binding of Isaac and Rogue Legacy, as well as Rogue Legacy's ""reincarnation"" features. So in that sense, Magicite is nothing new.What Magicite does differently is boil all of these elements into a simple platformer. The game is fun, you die quickly, rinse repeat and replay.If you like the genre, you'll like this game.Also, my hats off to the programmer. Unlike so many games, this game just feels optimized. It runs super smooth on my Macbook, and never even causes the fans to spin. And when I'm running off of battery, the drain is minimal. Well done."

The roguelike element sets it apart and greatly increases the difficulty factor.The artstyle is adorable and is set apart from games like Terraria, a game with an artstyle I didnt really enjoy.Now, the gameplay is short and snappy, you are thrown into a forest level, which is the easiest sort.You have to fight through 20 levels, the last being the scourge base, who are the big baddies of the game.The levels get increasingly challenging and even in multiplayer with your friends you will have a hard time getting through all 20.Multiplayer:The multiplayer aspect of this game is wonderful. I have a couple of friends who have the game and we must have played at least 100 hours of the game between us.The multiplayer is a bit buggy and Hamachi is required (to some annoyance), sometimes we would be at area 15, doing very well, when suddenly one of us would dissapear through the earth and the game would crash, not good. Even after the patch this still happens, please fix.The guy who made Magicite has recently released a new game,Roguelands, it is a complete clone of Magicite and I can't recommend it. I get it, he was trying to replicate the good result he got here, didnt work. Don't buy it. This is BETTER.Overall 8/10 = Good gameplay and fun with friends. Bit buggy here and there."

76561198206721920,Recommended,268750,21873065,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,UnderwurldChris,"I recently discovered Magicite, a cool horizontal scrolling platform game blending some RPG and crafting elements, with combat and magic. I’ve always been a fan of the ‘sideways scroller’, from Super Mario Bros. to R-Type (I would add Jet Set Willy here but it’s room-based and not strictly a scrolling landscape…) and the simple mechanics of running, jumping and picking stuff up is forever engraved on the fabric of the gaming universe. The beauty here is the Magicite world is procedurally generated – not a new concept in games but it creates a wonderfully unique environment each time, albeit a very familiar one, with platforms, monsters, chests, trees and other resources with which to interact. Oh and Magicite is a Rogue-like game. So when you dead… you dead.Each level in Magicite is one of a limited set of ‘biomes’ – forest, swamp, fire-land etc., each with different creatures and hazards. In single player, it can be fiendishly difficult particularly if you get a bad level generation (lots of monsters and not much space to manoeuvre) but once you get started and build up a stash of items, weapons and armour, you’re on your way. You can chop trees to collect wood and sticks, turn the wood into planks and the sticks into handles, turn the planks into blades and make tools and weapons: axes, picks and swords. Then you can mine stone, and iron, gold and diamond to make better tools and weapons… and armour. The better the tools, the more resources you get. The better the armour, the more likely you are to survive. And creatures can drop hide and pelt, food to eat and other useful things. Your character needs to eat regularly as well as keep their health topped up with potions.At the end of each level is a choice of three doorways. The doorway you choose decides the next level so it’s best to stick to forests or swamps for the first few so you can build up resources and items, and have a fighting chance of making it to the end. In between levels are ‘towns’; safe (ish) areas for buying and selling, crafting metal bars and making armour and clothing. It is probably important to say at this point that Magicite has some vague archetypes for developing characters. You can focus on melee combat and make metal armour (fighter), or make bows and arrows and hide armour (ranger), or make wands and cloth armour (wizard); all these things can affect your stats, how much damage you inflict, and can take, how fast you move and your magical ability. Progression through levels also increases these things depending on your race and other abilities. To start with, you are limited to one race but a neat achievement system unlocks different races, variants, hats (oh yes) and companions which become available for your next run.Another feature, one that is intensely annoying to start with, is the Scourge. If you spend too long on a level, a nasty monster turns up and beats the crap out of you – unless you get to one of the doorways. This gives a sense of urgency and propels you through the levels, creating a fast and often chaotic game. It has a multi-player mode which is when the game comes alive. Even playing with one other person improves the game considerably. One of you can focus on wood while the other is the miner, one can be melee while the other is ranged. The magic side is probably the most difficult to master but very powerful. You have to collect bugs (using nets made from sticks and spider webs) to make gems with which to craft wands. Some things need NPCs (metal bars, cloth) but most things can be combined by hand and on-the-fly as you fight through levels.There are a few ‘bosses’ in Magicite. Destroying spider nests will inevitably spawn a brood mother – this is pain at the start but soon you will be destroying every nest you can find to increase your loot, and a final boss can be found on the last level. I’ve been lucky enough to complete Magicite a few times in multi-player (with a lot of help!) and this will unlock some of the powerful achievements. It would be great to see Magicite expand into a more complex game, especially the crafting which is very limited, while retaining its simple concept. More variety and unique items would be great, like the wand that generates zombies, as well as more weapons and armour. The game could also use a few new biomes with more variety but overall it’s a great concept, fun to play and challenging."

Although my brother and I still are able to play Magicite together, some things are just really glitchy xD. But I love the game, and always have, ever since I saw it being played on Youtube. I saw a comment that was saying, ""No controller support, blabla."" This game doesn't need it. The ability to change controls is in the game too.Luckily, I was able to buy the game while it was on discount, so it only cost me $3.49. I do not think this game is worth $10 with the fact that you only want to play it for like, an hour before you ragequit because it is a little hard.But if you are considering buying the game, it is $10 very well spent. Make sure to get some buddies to play with, this game is very complicated if you don't know what to do xD""Best game, 10/10""-Jon Jafari***SEPT 2016 REVIEW***With the final update to Magicite released, I saw it fitting to give a few last words about the game. This game was my first purchase on steam, and I have enjoyed playing it ever since. Yes, there were obvious issues, and there still are, but I am a little biased for it because it was basically my first game that my brother and I played together non-stop. The developer is a one man team, and I have to say, he did a VERY nice job with this one. This was his first game he developed when he was in highschool. That's impressive! And the least I can say is thank you to Sean Young, for many great times in Magicte.As Sean moves on to other great games, I will continue to play Magicite until either I die or my PC dies.Now for the actual question, should you buy this game? Of course I think you should! But that's just me; I've had so many adventures with this game it's incredible. Despite the VERY long period of time of lack of update, the glitchy frustrating times playing with my brother, and the smalll amount of content, I enjoy it. I hope you do to.Rating:11/10"

Alone or with friends it manages to be interesting and difficult warranting who knows how many gameplay hours, but it has some VERY LARGE PROBLEMS, problems I had even read about prior to purchasing saying to myself ""It won't happen to me, the chances are probably one in a million."" guess what, they aren't. One in ten maybe.For starters chicken kind of just destroys your inventory when you try to cook it. To clarify, when i say destroy I mean it will lock you out of your inventory and prevent you from switching weapons on your hotbar. This WILL happen, its not some chance bug. Second, and I've only had this happen in multiplayer, there is a bug that turns the entire room into a black abyss upon spwaning and seems to be client based as it can happen to one player but not others. It leaves you with a small invisible platform on which you can pace back and forth while waiting for friends to finish the level and if you step off of said platform you fall for a good 10 seconds and teleport right back, so no suicide escape. Finally, of the bugs I found this was most frustrating as it happened to everyone i was playing with, the game will FREEZE WHEN YOU KILL THE FINAL BOSS. This last one was just the icing on the cake of soul crushing, dream shattering defeat. We spent over an hour just getting a successful run together and when we finally do the game implodes and we don't even get the credit for beating it. THANKS MAGICITE.TL;DR This game is broken as all hell. Save your money, I can't say if Roguelands (this dev's other game which is seemingly more fleshed out) is betteror worse but you're better off trying your luck there."

I had 11 big health potions, over a hundred iron arrows, a fire bow and a scourge blade. I shot all of my arrows at the scourge, but it wasn't enough to kill him. I had already used all of my potions, and things were not looking good for me at all. So I took my blade, swung it at the Scourge once, and it died. Victory! :)The game itself is pretty cool, especially the graphics, but it seems a bit underdeveloped to me. For example: there are tons of different kinds of melee weapons, but only four ranged and magic ones. For ranged it doesn't really matter because it is extremely strong, but magic cannot be considered a real class here. Three out of the four magic staves that I believe are currently in the game are made with gems, which are made from flies, which are caught with nets. Those very same gems can be used on a sword called Zweihander to give the exact same properties as the staves have, but with the benefits of a sword. This makes these staves completely useless. The fourth staff is used to summon zombies, which is nice but definitely not enough to make it through the game. A game called MAGICite should contain a lot of magic items in my opinion.Since I beat the game, let's talk about replayability. The races, hats and companions should encourage the player to keep playing until he or she has unlocked all of them. This is not the case, because many races and hats only have a 20% chance to unlock after the player does what has to be done to unlock it. Another example: the Trogon race has a 100% chance to unlock after the player beats the game in under an hour (which, by the way, is not much harder than beating the game normally. I think the developer told us on Kickstarter that play sessions lasted from about 15 minutes to 2 hours, but there is no way to play for 2 hours because if you stay in one district for too long, the scourge will kill you), the Noble class, however, only has a 20% chance to unlock after the player kills fifteen monsters in a single playthrough. I did unlock the Trogon class, but even though I have beaten hundreds of monsters in a lot of playthroughs I still didn't unlock the Noble class, which is supposed to be one of the first classes to unlock. If I achieve something, I want to get rewarded for it. Now I'd have to play the game again, which is not much of a problem, but I'd have to do a very similar run. There is just no fun in that.Finally I'd like to say something about roguelikes. Roguelikes are turn-based games featuring permanent death, tile-based graphics and randomly generated dungeons. Therefore, games with permanent death aren't neccesarily roguelikes. Magicite isn't turn-based, so it's not a roguelike.I don't recommend this game, because it just doesn't have enough content to be worth €10,- and the developer is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He promises to do a lot with his games, publishes them way too early and then counts his money while the players are stuck within walls or dying due to bugs."

,Recommended,268750,29844435,Posted: 11 February,all,CalFariC22,"Magicite is a challenging Rogue-like RPG platformer. The entire game is based off of a hardcore-like structure, which is definitely a good thing. It is nowhere near impossible, just quite difficult to stay alive until the end of the game. It's one of those games that will take quite a few tries until you complete it - there's no story, just lots of action.Learning the game is relatively easy from the offset, and it shares a similar crafting system with games such as Terraria. Each ""district"" - levels, if you will - are randomly generated, however they are not very diverse. At the end of each you can choose one of three doors which lead to unique biomes, which in turn have different creatures and loot within.Magicite is a great game to use when you're waiting on friends ending their turn on Civilization V - it runs perfectly over any modern game. I'll definitely be back to this game in the future.I rate Magicite a8.5/10, because it is very fun, and has wonderful artwork/graphics, but the multiplayer support isterribleand it could use more content."

Not the mentally disabled one, just the weird one who can't really decide what he wants to be - as a person or in the future.Magicite is not at all what I initially expected. And compared to my initial expectations, it was garbage. But after I found myself with nothing else to play and stupid amounts of free time where I can hop on, do a fourty minute run in an attempt to gain some new items, and go do something else, I started enjoying it immensly. Yes, there are certainly bugs and a heck ton of quirks you have to get used to working around. I don't think calling it a finished game is fair nor do I think the pricetag is really fair, but I do enjoy it now that I have it quite a lot.Addressing just a few of the bugs for anyone who does happen to get it and enjoy it-NPC interaction is very buggy, however pressing TAB a few times (going in out of your inventory) and jumping around a bit before going up to the NPC again usually will let you interact with them again. It's annoying but you get used to it, and it's not gamebreaking when you know how to get around it.Multiplayer is certainly buggy. I haven't used it in a year or so, so it may be better or worse than I remember (it wasn't very memorable to begin with), but it's alright if you want to put in the effort.As for singleplayer, it appears very difficult at first and the wiki is crucial to get an understanding of what exactly you're supposed to do when it comes to character progression. But once you get a hang of the ""classes"" and stats and whatnot, the game is definitely beatable in singleplayer. Hard as hell, sure, but beatable.This game is definitely an exclusive club of sorts and it took me over 50 hours to fully understand by trial and error how the different classes and systems work, how to combine races, hats and companions to get the most out of whatever fighting style you choose, etc. and it took 70 hours till I could beat it, But overall it was worth it.I'd recommend if you have time, patience and appreciation for things that goes beyond basic, annoying but easy to work around bugs. If none of those apply to you, don't bother. You'll just end up angry."
,Not Recommended,268750,32333845,Posted: 10 June,all,zimzat,"This game seems neat on the cover but quickly becomes annoying with little progress to show for the time spent.The crafting system is kludgy to control, unintuitive, lacks an in-game guide, makes inventory hard to manage, and heavily favors basic melee.There are three 'classes' based on attributes, attack, dex, and mag. Dex requires limited use arrows that must be crafted from refined minerals and anything using magic is few and far between (I played for 4 hours and found nothing that used magic). Armor for the melee class requires refined minerals while armor for dex or mag requires both refined minerals and refined leather or refined cloth, both of which are much rarer.The ""random"" nature of the game really just means replaying until you get lucky drops as all progress is locked behind a specific material upgrade tier system (must get wood before stone/bone, before iron, before gold, before diamond) and requires the first few resources found always be spent on crafting the next tier of pickaxe instead of armor or weapons, which in turn increases the grind. Or it requires that levels have any/enough enemies of a certain type to get access to any of the materials necessary.The ""random"" stats can be rerolled until you get the stats you want so it doesn't really matter or impact anything other than forcing the player to click 'reroll' a bunch of times.The ""rogue"" nature of the game and the very small health encourages going extremely slow, especially in single player games where you can't be revived by a friend, and encourage time played padding.

But after playing again and again i learned some recipes. The charm of this game is learning about crafting, monsters' movements, and even the random generating of the world. Even after 4-5 hours in im still learning things about the crafting and monsters. If you get this game you'll have a lot of fun."

Throughout the game you are fighting the Scourge.Alot of reviews I saw that were negitave always went after the multiplayer. Obviously they haveNOT heard of port-forwarding. Magicite's multiplayer doesnt just let people in like most games.You have to port forward. People say they needed a third party program but you really don't. Just port forward Terraria and you already got this game set up. (Terraria uses the same exact port aka: 7777) The equipment is very interesting and always change your stats unless you buy them in a town. In that case they wont change anything but your reach. The game also has interesting bosses and companions. The Scourge Lair is by far one of the most difficult districts in the game. You are being chased by a giant wall in that level while dodging attacks from every direction. I think the developer did great with this game. Especially with the perma-death. Also, beware of the Broodmother. That thing tanks damage like no tommorrow."

,Recommended,268750,35050151,Posted: 18 September,all,iNARi,"This is one of the best games I've played lately, but like every game, it has perks and cons.Pros:It' s a really smooth and funny game that can get you stuck in hours playingThere are a bit of things to learn in order to play efficiently, but after some pratice and learning it's all fun and gamesBasically, its gameplay is something that goes from terraria to the binding of Isaac, with really nice resultsI must give an huge shout out to the devYeah, the Dev, because this game was developed and published by a single person, and let me say♥♥♥♥, you did something amazing.Cons:There are really few players that play this, so, to experience multiplayer to the full I suggest gifting it to your friends yourself (It costs really nothing in comparison to a lot of games)Sadly, the one man army thing gives the game some flaws.There are still some bugs in the game and it won't have any other updates in the futureI'm not complaining about the bugs, but you can feel a small lack of content (for example in the number of endgame weapons, there are only about 4 swords and some other miscs.)magic weapons are kinda limited and some enemies are a bit brokenIf I'm saying this it's only because I still see an huge amount of potential here, not because I don't like the overall game.In the end, buy it and try it for yourself, it's really cheapIf you like platforms and rogue-likes, I promise you won't regret it"

,Recommended,268750,35115223,Posted: 21 September,all,Sleeves,"Pros:-The combat is very unforgiving - similarly to Dark Souls it revolves around well-timed retreats and strikes, fighting is great fun once you get your head around it.-Also similarly to Dark Souls - expect to die a lot. As you go further through the dungeons, you will unlock more classes, hats, and companions depending on how well you did in a single go.-You will get attached to your characters and cry.-There are several different-looking areas which escalate in difficulty; each offering different enemies, resourses, and loot.-The artstyle is very easy on the eyes, the thick outlines paired with the pixel art give everything a ""cartoony"" aesthetic. Somewhat similar to Realm of the Mad God.-Good crafting system, not overly complex (not all that many recipies though).Cons:-Sometimes interacting with NPCs or buying items in the hub area does not work properly, the option to interact will not appear.-Could do with some more crafting options.Side note: This game is perfect for the Switch/3DS. Devs pls"
76561198181861549,Recommended,268750,35138847,Posted: 22 September,all,The Man in the Moon,"Magicite is pretty fun. It's not the best Rougelike I've ever played (that's The Binding of Isaac), but then again I haven't had the chance to play it multiplayer. It's probably more fun that way--most games are. Anyway, my only particular complaint is that the last update broke a few things, as well as added a really annoying sound effect that plays every time you craft an item. Otherwise, the game is pretty solid."
,Recommended,268750,35406641,Posted: 1 October,all,MrJBeetle,"This roguelike can be tough, and multiplayer has the potential to make it even tougher (or easier depending on what you're trying to unlock). Either way, it's a ton of fun and highly recommended. That feeling I got the first time I beat the game was like no other - a huge sigh of relief coupled with the feeling of wanting to play it again with different starting equipment.My friend and I spent hours trying various strategies which were guided by what unlock we were trying to achieve. In my opinion, this is this developer's best game to date, though I really enjoy Roguelands too. This was the first game I decided to co-op Let's Play, so I have many fond memories of it, and ever since I found it I have looked forward to his future creations.If I had to point out a negative, I'd say it is the multiplayer netcode. While it's not unplayable, there are certain bugs that only occur in multiplayer, and some of them are gamebreaking. Leaving areas at the same time as your co-op partner, for instance, can cause sync issues for the rest of the play session, and in some cases, make the round unwinnable. Still, I recommend this game BECAUSE it has multiplayer. It just wouldn't be the same without it."
