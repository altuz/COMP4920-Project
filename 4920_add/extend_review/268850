,Recommended,268850,29961453,Posted: 16 February,all,Chango,I told this to start when Windows 10 does.It doesn't.But you don't have any other choice really when you're overclocking EVGA GPUs.So I suggest you download it.  But not the Steam version.  What's the point?

76561197968697930,Not Recommended,268850,29603832,Posted: 31 January,all,Frozen Yoghurt,"Considering that it simply provides an graphical interface to overclock your graphics card, I am wondering why it wants to know all the personal data it asks for on startup...Plus: how on earth does this program weigh in at a whopping 150+ MB if Afterburner manages to do the same with 50MB?I'll switch back to Afterburner and can only recommend to stay away from this tool.PS: I had to keep the skin editor running to get past the 5 minutes requirement on Steam.Who thought about not being able to downvote a software that is not even functioning?!"

,Not Recommended,268850,29718507,Posted: 5 February,all,Smurf,"There is an old saying i was taught ""Dont fix something that isn't broke"" this software wasn't perfect but did the job. I must commend EVGA for completely ruining this and repetedly making it worse. So i must congratulate whoever set themselves such low standards and failing to meet them and delivering such an EPIC FAIL well done, you should feel proud and please feel free not to pollute the gene pool"

I was soley interested in controlling my GPU fan's to regulate my GPU temp and Precision is way over my head in terms of functions and UI and causes more headaches than it's worth. Confusing fan curve settings, no real instructions, and not to mention if you have it set to Windows start up you can't access the software without going through hoops that require precise timing on start up. (If I saw ""App is already running"" one more time I was going to punch my computer) No comment on overclocking as I really don't need it and therefore don't use it."

,Not Recommended,268850,29749690,Posted: 6 February,all,EvidencePlz,"It used to be great and helped me immensely with controlling my GPU's fan. But now it's started to ask me for my personal information such as full name, email address and my underwear size. Okay the underwear part was a joke but the rest is true. What's even more sad is that the app doesn't launch anymore and quits when I refuse to provide the info. I uninstalled it and got MSI Afterburner which is much better. So long EVGA. It was nice when it worked."

Precision-X is required to tweak the RGB lighting on my card, so I figured I might as well use it for any OC and for OSD duty.The RGB control DOES work, but I can't for the life of me get the OSD to function.  It worked the first day, but not since. Do the OC utilities work?  I have no idea without being able to moniter framerates/freqs/temps on the OSD.EVGA, fix your software!"

,Recommended,268850,29656839,Posted: 2 February,all,Gbcrespo,"It's really impressive how this software can easily upgrade your performance up to almost 10 fps. In my occasion, a GTX 960M can run about every game in the industry today, but on low settings the highest demanding ones, with the overclock sometimes I can upscale to medium, and that's something that I really appreciate. On the downside though, I don't know when the software stopped working in the background, I usually tell from the low fps I'm getting. Aside from this only issue, the app is good to go"
