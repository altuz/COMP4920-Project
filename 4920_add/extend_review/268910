,Recommended,268910,35333903,Posted: 30 September,all,Pomikuza!,"Paying debt to the devil is not an easy feat.Highly recommend for anyone who miss punishing 80s/early 90s run n guns like Contra and Megaman. The 1930s animation style is also amazing to look at with surreal boss designs very similar to Silly Symphony.The controls are very arcadey with 8 directional shooting, single jump, descending platforms and a special attack, but it also adds parrying and dash, which were way less common back then. Parrying is not the same as most games as you can only parry certain pink bullets or enemies done by bouncing off it while in midair (working as a double jump). It does not shoot the projectile back at the boss, but instead gives you one full card for your your super meter, letting you use a special attack for the specified weapon you have equipped or a super attack if you hold 5 cards. Weaons in the game also feel situational enough for that I would switch them around for specific bosses, there's no weapon more overpowered than the other. A lot consider spread shot OP, but due to its low range it's useless against certain bosses or boss phases where you're forced to stay at range from the boss. You can also have two weapons equipped and switch between instantly when you want.Every boss has multiple phases, and are only 1-3 minutes long, but due to everything you gotta dodge all the time without much breaks just one minute can feel waaaaay longer. This is something I felt for Furi as well (another amazing challenging boss rush game I recommend). The boss phase transformations are very surreal and they can go from being a couple battletoads turning into a slot machine or a bird stuck in a bird house to a featherless bird carried in a stretcher spitting up its heart that attacks you. You can choose between fighting them in simple or regular mode. Simple mode gives you linear patterns, while regular they will be random, so you have to be more careful with what the boss will do next. You can only get a contract by playing on regular mode (required to advance the game), but simple mode  is okay for practicing the patterns. The difficulty of the bosses curves really well too. It starts out a little rough, but gets really challenging at the second island, and even more so at the third island. Then the finale after that is a true Satan's work.There are also shoot em up bosses with the same parrying, but instead of dashing it let's you shrink to move faster and dodge projectiles since your hitbox is smaller as well. But it also reduces your range and damage to balance it out.Platforming sections, which were added later in development and got the game delayed are actually pretty good too. They really feel like old arcade platformers. Most platformer levels also have a miniboss at the end, so they're still not bossless (even a Mega Man 2 reference in one of them). The intensity of them are on the same scale as the boss fights, you won't be running around without enemies coming at you from multiple directions. Only thing I thought could be done better is hiding the coins, they're a little too easy to obtain, so most of the challenge is just finishing the stage itself with a good rating. You generally won't have to replay the level just to try and find coins you couldn't.But on the topic of coins, you can find hidden things in the overworld. Some characters will reward you with a coin for doing things for them and there are a few hidden paths granting you a coin or a shortcut to later levels. It's a really nice touch I wasn't even expecting from this type of game.The replayability is also great for with expert mode being unlocked after beating the game and trying to get S rank for every boss. There is also a pacifist rank for platform stages where you have to beat the stage without killing anything, which can be tricky since most stages have midbosses or walls that you need to find ways to skip.I had been waiting for this game for years, and it honestly went beyond my expections. It's definitely one of my favourite games after just 10 hours and hope you all buy it, it's a very rare gem you won't see much of in modern gaming."
,Recommended,268910,35313230,Posted: 29 September,all,VALIS,"Brilliant. Truly brilliant.Gameplay-wise, it reminds me quite a bit of 8 and 16-bit era platformers like Contra and Super Contra, Gunstar Heroes, or a sped-up Mega Man. The only way to win is to practice, and learn, and get better. Learn how the bosses move, learn when you're safe to move, and learn the entire sequence of the boss battle. It's difficult but very compelling -- you want to try again right away, because, ah ha, now I figured out his pattern! But the boss stages have multiple ""waves,"" so you don't learn their one trick and it's over. You have to remember the tricks to each wave of the boss stage. It's the perfect balance between challenging and frustrating. You can do it, you'll just have a good number of fun, failed attempts along the way.If Cuphead were just about the gameplay, it would be a solid title but not exactly groundbreaking. But that art. Oh my god, that art. I was already a huge fan of old cartoons from Warner Bros., Fleischer Studios, Disney, and others, so even if Cuphead made a mediocre attempt at the style, I would have loved it. But I'm thrilled to say the art style, the humor, the little touches here and there: PERFECT. The game is a visual delight, and it's not just the style that's compelling, it's the black humor throughout, like characters shooting Craps in an empty coffin. It's like the bleakest Betty Boop or Porky Pig cartoon, where every animal, vegetable, and mineral is an anthropomorphic nightmare.While Cuphead is a combination of 1980s platform gameplay and 1930s cartoon stylings, it feels like one of the freshest experiences I've had gaming in quite a while. Very warmly recommended."

,Recommended,268910,35358662,Posted: 30 September,all,William Shakesman,"Cuphead is Contra. Granted, a Contra with only two proper levels per world and a half dozen nasty bosses, but it's Contra.The 30s/40s cartoon aesthetic is on point without a hint of modern cynicism or faux-retro nonsense. It's a beautiful, charming game in every sense.It is HARD though. Because you have infinite retries and the level select goes straight to the boss or level, the game takes the liberty to make the bosses tough, elaborate affairs. We're talking Ys levels of boss design. After world 1, you should expect to be clocking anywhere from 10-40 deaths just to get a handle on them. They're all tough, imaginative, and fun. Most of the deaths are pretty fair, though there are some pattern combos that the bosses can do that ring a little BS to me, but because death is such a small penalty, it's hard to get that mad.Cuphead understands everything it is referencing on a fundamental level, from the classic cartoons to the classic game design, this game really is as good as it looks."

,Recommended,268910,35469674,Posted: 4 October,all,Dougie Jones,"Been playing platformers since Apogee era games in the early 90's and have to say that this is among one of my favourite games out of the entire genre. Cuphead isn't just a masterpiece in terms of its artistic, audio and visual work, the games design and gameplay shines just as much as those do.The games art style is a tribute to 1930's cartoons and the gameplay mechanics are a mish-mash of 90's shoot-em-up side scrollers such as Contra, Metal Slug and Gunstar Heros (more so the latter) and though there are a few 'Run and Gun' levels which involve platforming, collecting coins, shooting/avoiding enemies until you reach the end of the level, the games main focus is on boss fights, each being very unique from the last.The game itself is not easy either although I wouldn't say it's as hard as a lot of people make it out to be, it is very forgiving seeing as you're able to retry bosses/levels at your own leisure rather than getting slapped with a gameover screen after your continues are depleted. The fights are completely fair too, although punishing should you lose concentration and mistime a dodge or not memorize the way certain attacks work and repeat the same mistakes over and over again until even the announcer begins to sound bored of announcing the start of battles.The audio/soundtrack is incredibly well done, all original music composed for this game sound in place for a 30's cartoon as do the sound effects.Meticulous effort went into every aspect of this games design, it was hard to wipe a smile off my face while playing it, although a few bosses came close to achieving that. Beyond having a great time with this game, what's even more great is that something like this exists in this era of gaming aswell being a critical and commercial success, it gives me hope for the future of this industry. For newcomers, don't be intimidated by people complaining that it's too hard, it really isn't, each fight is fair and although admittedly some bosses for me almost took the same amount of time to defeat that others took to complete the entire game, the joy of overcoming a challenge was monumentally satisfying.Highly recommended game and deserves every bit of the praise it has recieved. Looking forward to seeing what this developer delivers in the future as there was no lack of effort put into the creation of this game."

,Recommended,268910,35317355,Posted: 29 September,all,NeoRizer,"Cuphead is a side scrolling action platforming shoot 'em up game. It utilizes early Disney esque art styles for it's visuals with complementary Big Band Jazz (Swing) and Barbershop back ground music to really emphazise the 1930's theme it's presenting.You bet the Devil on a game of dice, now it's time to pay the price.Cuphead and Mugman are the main protagonists of our tale of side scrolling local co-op only action (just thought I'd get that out of the way). They made a deal with the Devil on a game of craps, thinking they couldn't possibly lose, they were wrong.The plot sets the mood from the very beginning, a game with an innocent cartoonish look and innocent looking characters but underlying adult themes are afoot... moral of the story? Don't gamble with your life.GameplayCuphead plays very much like the original Contra games, except the colors are reversed this go around. P1 (Cuphead) is red and P2 (Mugman) is blue. You walk around an overworld map choosing destinations to venture in to. Some are bosses, some are side scrolling levels.There's always more than a single option available to you but in the end you have to complete every stage to progress the main story. There are side quests to embark on by talking to overworld NPC's and hidden coins to collect. There's a shop to buy different styles of shots and charms to help balance out your weaknesses as a player.Once an area is selected you then choose your difficulty. At first only Simple (Easy) and Regular (Normal) modes are unlocked. Once you finish the game, Expert (Hard) mode becomes available.Disclaimer: The final two boss fights in the game can only be played on Regular (Normal) and Expert (Hard) modes.The differences between modes are as follows:Simple (Easy):Enemies have slower attack patterns, their attack cycle pool is a bit more shallow, meaning they won't use all of their available attacks and some phases of a boss fight will be removed entirely.Regular (Normal):A normal level of play for above average gamers. Most boss phases are available, and most attack cycles are available, enemies attack at an increased speed over Simple (Easy) mode. Highest rank you can earn is an A+.Expert (Hard):For true masochists. All the stuff from Regular (Normal) mode is here, except now all boss attack speeds are increased by about 1.5. Some bosses also have an extra phase added in and some even combine attacks together. It's like playing the game on turbo mode but you can now earn the coveted S Rank if you perfect the stage. Good Luck!Once you've made your choice in difficulty you proceed to shoot, jump, parry and dash your way through some side scrolling areas (6 in total to be exact) but the meat of the game is just an all out boss brawl. There's over 20 bosses to fight all with unique patterns and looks, no two bosses are alike so you're going to have your work cut out for you.At the end of each stage you're graded on your performance based on certain criteria:How long did it take you to finish the fight / stage?How many hits did you take?How many parry attacks did you perform?How many super attacks did you land?Trying to get A+ (on Regular mode) or S ranks (on Expert mode) seems to be the meat of the game and where most of your time is going to be spent. You could always just breeze through stages never thinking twice about how well you did but if you want to be a Cuphead master, you'll have to practice.Rankin no wayhinders you from completing the game,the ranks are inconsequentialto your progression of the story. Once you finish a level or beat a boss, more of the map will open up to you and you can venture onward.Final ThoughtsIt's a fantastic game. As someone who grew up with Contra, it's a love letter to that game series as well as fans of a lost age of art and music. It's actually one of the only high quality side scrolling shoot 'em up games on Steam of it's kind that stays true to form. Simple yet incredibly challenging.I would recommend the purchase if you're interested in something different for a change. Put down the mouse and keyboard and pick up ye olde game controller and go to town. I played this game for 8 hours straight and finished it in a single sitting. It took a lot of patience and concentration but it's completely do-able on Regular mode... Simple should be a breeze for the casuals. It helps to have grown up in a generation where this genre was a household name and not so niche as they've become today... If you're an old boy like me, this game should be an adequate challenge but not impossible by any stretch of the imagination.There's a lot of stigma going on with this game right now and some gamers are saying the difficulty curve is causing them to think twice about purchasing. Rest assured there's a difficulty selection built in to the game before you access each level so there's really no excuse to be afraid... if you can't handle it, play on Simple mode. Remember you have 2 hours to refund.The difficulty spikes fairly quickly so you know, just don't be a Dean Takahasi and take 10 minutes to beat the tutorial and you'll be able to see if the game's challenge is truly for you. Although if it does take you more than an hour to beat the first stage even, I would suggest refunding it... you're not going to make it.Even though ratings are highly subjective and don't really mean anything, it's like an 8 / 10. An above average game and will end up being a cult classic.Gripes 'O MineIt's a great game but it's not a perfect game by any means, it can be insanely unfair and frustrating at times, especially if you're going for A+ or S Ranks... this is where the game shows it's true imbalance.The dev's could have did more with the equipment system as it seemed kind of basic. Aside from the peashooter, spread shot and chaser (homing) weapons, the extra weapons and charms we never saw in promotional videos were all lackluster and really gimmicky... I tried them all once and switched back to the basic stuff. The variety of weapons just could have been a bit better. There's also no way to upgrade your weapons either, weapons are always at the same strength level, you'll never feel over powered in this game ever.Some bosses are a bit ridiculous in length. Some bosses can take upwards of 10 minutes to complete which is a bit crazy and defeating at times. It actually makes the first phases of the boss fights tedious, unfun and annoying to have to endure if you're only having trouble on the final phase.I'm also not impressed you can't choose to play as Mugman in single player. You're basically forced to play as Cuphead in single player mode... not that it matters, it's just an asethetic thing but I personally perferred Mugman's design over Cuphead... options are always nice and it wouldn't have taken them much effort to throw in a character select screen before you start playing.It only has local co-op which is also another cop-out from the developers. I mean I get it, it's supposed to be retro but please, we're living in 2017, there's no excuse for not programming some netcode in this thing just for convenience sake.The developers claimed if the game sells well they may include online co-op.  I'm not going to hold my breath on that one. If we ever do get it, this game will be long forgotten by that point."

Every boss feels different from the rest, and the flying levels and ""Run 'n' Gun"" sections offer a nice change. Please note that the core of the game never changes.

I was hoping to use WASD for movement and mouse buttons for shooting, but you can't bind mouse buttons.A practice mode. The simple difficulty is a joke. Whole phases and moves of bosses are cut out. If you're stuck on the final phase of a boss, there's no way to isolate that section to practice. You'll have to fight your way to it every time.Some indication that I'm damaging a boss. Excluding phase changes, bosses show no sign of damage besides flashing white when you hit them. When you finally defeat them, it's often abrupt. You can't see how far you made it until the death screen."

This very much extends to the sound design that works along side the visuals to create the perfect mix.If there was one negative I can add about the visuals, its the response you get when hitting an enemy that isn't as clear as i feel it should be on occasion.On to the bosses themselves, they are excellent and near damn perfect from start to finish - each boss is designed in a unique way and each fight is rewarding as you learn mechanics and boss movements. The game is hard but its never unfair - so learning the bosses is a massive joy as you see yourself getting closer to that victory screen with each try.Lastly... this game was very much designed for controllers in mind and it shows. Playing on a keyboard is less precise or enjoyable, and the default keybindings are pretty much the worst I've seen this year.

,Recommended,268910,35318337,Posted: 29 September,all,cricketlenny,"[EARLY IMPRESSIONS: 2 HOURS]This game is, as of this time of writing, living up to all of my expectations.The graphics/artistic direction in this game is absolutely phenomenal, both impressive and appealing to watch. They hit that retro cartoon vibe perfectly.The performance is stable and consistent, with only a few drops below 60 during loading screens during my play time.Controls are tight and responsive, although the default layout for the controller isnt the most ideal when it comes to dashes, I recommend making some slight changes to it if you think this could be an issue.Gameplay is very entertaining and decently challenging, but not so difficult that it becomes cumbersome.I at least had enough skill to make it past the tutorial without any issues, so that definitely makes this review credible, no doubt!The mechanics are remniscent of Mega Man X, but not so closely matching them that it feels like a ripoff of it.I wasn't expecting multiple modes of firing on the fly, and its definitely a nice touch.The bosses are a wonderful time, with lots of entertainly nostalgic character designs and tough but fair methods of attack.Based on my current time and first impressions, I do not hesitate to give this game a 9/10, absolutely worth your time and money."

It looks gorgeous, both in screenshots and in motion. We’ve been enthusiastic about it for a while.For gamers with tough reflexes forged in games like Super Meat Boy, Trials HD, or even the Contra series (or worse), the unforgiving run-and-gun boss fights of Cuphead will be a welcome challenge, leading to lots of satisfying, fist-pumping catharsis when a long string of attempts finally leads to success. For everyone else, Cuphead's awe-inspiringly detailed animation is best enjoyed in the more limited Simple mode or via the YouTube playthroughs that will surely flood the Internet in the days to come.The GoodUltra-vibrant, screen-filling animation is unlike anything I've ever seen in a game.Game is extremely challenging but never feels unfair.Peppy jazz soundtrack will stay in your head for hours.Imaginative and highly varied character and fight design.""Simple"" difficulty offers a much easier path to see most of the game's content.The BadOccasional obvious digital art elements can ruin the look of a scene.Overall challenge level is unforgiving to the point of controller-throwing frustration.No way to proceed to the ending if you get perpetually stuck on one particular boss.Run-and-gun platforming levels largely aren't worth the frustration.The UglyDying within seconds of killing a boss, then suffering through 15 more minutes of failed attempts.Verdict: Those with a high tolerance for repeating difficult 2D shooting challenges should buy it.

With tight inputs, smooth controls and an animation style that will have you saying, ""Well golly jee, that's a rootin' tootin' good time."" this game is a classic in the making.I haven't played a game in some time where I died constantly and it made the exerience all the better. Map layout is great, bosses are tons of fun, run n' gun levels that are a pleasure to get down memorized. Dare I say, I felt a little classic SNES Donkey Kong Country joy in my heart.Maybe the art style is not your thing (if you're a big ol' stick in the mud), regardless, the gameplay will have you hooked (if you're any kind of actual gamer).

76561198031799936,Not Recommended,268910,35486788,Posted: 4 October,all,MY C0MPUTER,"Why the negative review? The game is perfect, isn't it?Yes and No.I have beaten the game and gotten the vast majority of achievements so why would I do that if I didn't like the game?There is a lot to love about Cuphead but I don't see anyone pointing out its faults. So that's what I'll do.I'm just going to skip over the part where the game is visually and audibly stunning and get into the cons. I'm sure these cons have the potential to ruin the game for some people. That is the only reason why I'm doing this.Con 1: The game is really a compilation of boss battles. Each boss battle is unique and cool. However a lot of the times bosses will have seemingly random moves that make no sense. Moves that you would only know about through trial and error. If you want to get the best score, you can't take damage at all which makes the game very grueling at times as you constantly open menu and restart because a random shark jumped behind you and took up half the screen instantly.Con 2: The items in this game are not balanced. Some are useful 90% of the time while others are good on paper but awful in practice (this doesn't apply to gun types really. there are only two useless guns but they are fun to use anyway. )This includes one passive that if removed from the game I'm sure it would be impossible. (the smoke grenade, which makes you invincible when you dash allowing you to just teleport past enemies)There isn't a lot of variety in items to begin with, so this just makes it feel like you only have 2 - 3 choices ever.Con 3 : I feel like the game would be funner for everyone if the first few levels were easier. I'm not saying they aren't relatively easy, but to a new player it can be a frustrating experience and if it were easier it would make the transition a lot smoother. Something we can all learn from Super Meat Boy is that if you make a game that relies on being challenging, then you need to start the player off slowly.Con 4: Building on what I mentioned before, Cuphead relies on being challenging because the game itself is not very long. If you don't worry about stats or getting perfect score the game can be completed in no time. This means it is really only made for the type of player that always tries to beat their own score, which is not everyone.Con 5: Hitboxes and determining what object will hurt you and what won't can be really confusing. Usually you can tell because the game consists of the background, platform, obstacles that don't hurt you, and everything else that does hurt you. This is similar to my first Con that this creates a sort of artificial difficulty and encourages trial and error. However this is more due to the nature of the game's art style and outlining, which is usually consistent and not a problem.That's really it. The game is fantastic in every other way, however these problems need to be noticed. A score wouldn't do it justice."

,Recommended,268910,35481108,Posted: 4 October,all,Omega the Squid Man,"From what I have seen in this game when I first played it today is that It does remind me of Konami's ""Contra"" series, and the SEGA Genesis game, ""Gunstar Heroes"". Despite it being heavily focused on boss battles, there are some things in this game that do give some interesting mechanics like for example: ""You can dash like you can do in Capcom's ""Mega Man X"" games, and you can buy some upgrades with only the coins you find in the game."" Apart from that, this is what it would be like if video games were invented in the 1930's (I know they were invented in the 50's but still, you get what I mean) with that old cartoon feel. As much as I grew up watching 1930's to 1980's cartoons as a kid, I gotta say that this really brings me back to my childhood days when classic 1920's 1930's cartoons, etc. used to come on TV. Even though I'm pretty sure that there will probably be a Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4 version along with the Xbox One and Steam versions soon, but who knows? It could happen. Once again. This game deserves a thumbs up from me, and a rating of 10/10!"

,Recommended,268910,35500483,Posted: 5 October,all,billbotics,"There is a reason this game is so popular. It is damn near perfect.Pros:The Aesthetic.This alone is worth the $20. The amount of care that went into creating the sprites, backgrounds, animations, sound effects, and music is worth your money. These developers deserve more, quite frankly. If you see this on sale and you still don't have it, you should actually *wait* until it's full price before picking it up. It's that good.Perfect difficulty.Although this may be a point of contention for some, I believe difficulty vs. reward in this game is perfect. There's a simple mode that allows less experienced players have a shot at seeing most of the content. The regular difficulty is not that difficult. I'm pretty experienced at platformers, but I'm not that good. The game only took me roughly 7 hours to beat on regular on a blind playthrough. Compare that to a game like say ""I wanna be the guy"" and you'll find the difficulty and amount of time spent very reasonable.Variety.20+ bosses, each with multiple phases and every single phase is unique. Not to mention multiple weapons, super powers and charms that allow you to brew your own flavor of Cuphead.Unique.I've never played an officially released game like this. I attempted to play ""I Wanna Be The Guy"" and failed miserably, but that game was never officially released. As far as I know, this is first of this type of game to be officially released. I could be and probably am wrong. But this was a wholly new and unique experience for me, and likely to many others who might pick this up. (Please tell me of other games if I am wrong, because I would love to play them!)Cons:Repetitive.This will flat out turn some people off. You will die many, many times in this game. You will hear the same music, play through the same boss phase, and hear the same sound effects a plethora of times consecutively. This can irritate a casual gamer, but in my opinion, that is where the aestheticreallyhelps. It's hard to stay mad at Woody Woodpecker stuck in a birdhouse.Casually Difficult.While there is a simple mode in this game, it will still be too much for some casual gamers. If they are not able to beat the first 3 or so levels, that's all they will see. This is true of most games, however. It just may be too difficult for your average casual gamer that may be interested in this art style/aesthetic. If you believe you are one of these people, it may be better to just watch someone play the game. It pains me to say that, but 20 bucks is 20 bucks.Somewhat short.This is a very small gripe, because it feels like there is so much content in this game. The playtime of 7 hours to casually beat the game on regular seemed a bit on the short end to me. Now, I plan on getting all of the achievements and even trying my hand at a speedrun, but for a first time playthrough, it left me wanting. This may have also been enhanced by, again, how truly unique and breathtaking the aesthetic is.I had to write a review for this game, because it's not often that a game comes along and wows you the way that this game did for me.10/10-An instant classic."

,Recommended,268910,35405167,Posted: 1 October,all,ArtificialRaven,"Cuphead is a fast paced arcade-style action platformer with a fantastic early 1900's cartoon art style and soundtrack. It sports single player & local co-op 2 player modes. Boasting some of the tightest controls I've ever felt in a 2D action platformer and subjectively some of the best looking authentic hand drawn animation in gaming, For me just the spectacle was worth the price of admission.  While difficult, the game consists of numerous boss fight stages and 6 platforming stages spread over the course of 4 worlds.  With the uber responsive controls, varied weapons, super moves and charms the player can purchase, the player is given all the tools needed to be succesful. Failure strictly lies with that of the player and not the game. It feels punishing but fair. So one must practice, practice and practice.Besides the boss & platforming stages there is a small, linear world map to explore with NPCs, shortcuts and hidden goodies along with a shop to spend your gold coins in to purchase upgrades.  Once you've defeated the bosses of each world you're allowed to move on to the next ultimately facing off with the Devil at the end. There are special unlockable color & sound modes for completing hidden objectives, such as beating all the Run 'n Gun (platforming) stages without killing a single enemy. And for getting a perfect grade on all platforming and boss stages. There's even an expert mode if players complete the game on Regular difficulty. The achievements will also feel satisfying and well earned.Is this worth the $20 USD price tag? I sure thought it was. My only regret was not buying the Deluxe Edition with the soundtrack. The game is short but sweet. Quality over quantity. That's it for my mini-review of Cuphead, thank you for reading."

The game was originally announced back in E3 2014 but it was delayed because they needed more time to polish the game. It is safe to say that this game delivered way beyond expectation, like seriously, give these guys a round of applause for their greatest work and deserve a recognition. I will address some negative reviews later because it is irritating me. So let's talk about Cuphead in depth.Story:It is a tale of Cuphead and Mughead. Two boys are having fun and wondering around the map until they discover The Devil's Casino. Cuphead and Mughead decide to gamble and they are on a winning streak. Until the Devil himself appeared, he makes a proposition; if the Cuphead and Mughead wins the gamble, they are going to take the casino and everything, if they lose; their souls will be consumed by the Devil. Cuphead decides to be greedy and they lose the bet, meaning that their souls will be taken but they want to live instead. So they make another proposition from them. The Devil wants the Soul Contracts and they are in deep trouble once they got kicked out. Luckily, the Elder Kettle will help you out and do what the Devil says.Gameplay:The gameplay of Cuphead is very simple yet effective. It really reminds me of run and gun games like Contra series or should I say Contra-esque gameplay. The game provides an open world exploration but it is linear, that doesn't mean it's not a bad thing since it's supposed to capture the aesthetics of the game or more like what if there's a video game in 1930s. They added an upgrade system and you spend coins to buy shot types (spreads, charged shots, etc.) and charms (extra lives, supers regeneration, etc.) There is a parry system and it is intuitive to use. It is not a traditional parry like Dark Souls (lmfao), it is a visual cue (any pink projectiles or enemies). The controls are tight and customisable which is a great additional in case of everyone wants to have their own controls. It's easy to pick up the controller and master the mechanics. Every boss fights are unique and I love each bosses (even though it made me cry internally when I almost kill every bosses in the game). Cuphead implemented Co-Op during the playthrough, but unfortunately the game does not support online and I am not against it.Technical Aspect:The setting sets in 1930s like I mention on Gameplay paragraph. They absolutely capture the jazz musical scores, the animation of every single characters (I can't believe it's a frame by frame animation), the lively background during boss fights. The musical score and graphics, they are a 10 out of 10 rating. I was actually humming some boss fight's theme and they are catchy as. I love the references they add, like Acme from Looney Tunes or other things that is related to 1930s cartoon shows.Address to the Negative Reviews:I am going to address the negative reviews, so bear with me. Cuphead is challenging and fair, not impossible and difficult. This is what the game is meant to be played. The game throws back to the 90s platform run and gun shooter and boss rushes game. It helps you to be a perfectionist or getting better at it. I know people are sick of getting killed over and over again, but let me say this, it helps you to analyze what you did wrong on certain sections and improve it. Seriously, negative reviews are making me cringe because people say how lazy the difficulty is and the gameplay isn't too deep or repetitive. I know there is one saying; looks can be deceiving and this is the game that works out too well. I think that should wrap up this address.Verdict:Cuphead is one of the best indie platform run and gun game I have ever played for a while. The story seems basic but it didn't hold me back anyway. The gameplay is Contra-esque, which is fun for me. The musical scores, graphics and settings are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I hate to say this, Cuphead is not for everybody because of the difficulty but still give this game a try, it's a great game to start playing the difficult game genre. The bugs in this game are somewhat minimal, so I do not think there are any game breaking bugs I encountered so far. The official score for this game, a9 out of 10."

,Recommended,268910,35397694,Posted: 1 October,all,Beamex,"This is a difficult game to recommend to just anyone, and there are a few things you should consider before you drop $20 on this beautifully animated and composed platformer.First thing to mention is it is rediculously hard. A player of average skill will struggle with the first few stages of this game, and if you don't handle repetitive deaths well and starting from the beggining each time, then you will want to reconsider buying this. If you are below average at games, or just platformers in general, you'll for sure want to look elsewhere as you simple will not get much value for your money.Second thing needed to know is it is ""heavily focused on boss-battles"" according to the steam description. I feel more needs to be said about this because it's pretty much a boss-battle game, with a very small amount of platformer levels throw in. Essentially you begin a majority of level fighting the boss and that's it. If you're expecting something like Megaman, this is not that.After all that being said, if you're still interested, then I recommend you buy this game. It brings the same sort of challenge you would expect from games like Wings of Vii, IWBTG, and Boshy. All the bosses are very unique and bring new challenges, and the controls are spot on. The parry system takes some getting used to but is very fun to use and feels great when you land them properly. There is a rating system which brings simple, classic replayability that old school gamers will enjoy, aswell as 2 player coop.My only complaint so far is how the difficulty scaled during my normal playthrough. I found that the difficulty went up very sharp towards the end of world 2, which is ok, but it dropped off at the end of world 3 and all the way towards the end of the game. Based on some world 2 bosses taking me an hour+ to beat I was expecting the final few bosses to take me days to beat, but instead they took me maybe 20 minuites each. I'm hoping expert difficulty is different.Super fun game though."

The game is definitely not easy, it's pretty challenging, but it just makes you feel more badass when you beat these bosses! The game focuses mainly on boss fights, theres a few levels which lets you run through a level to collect gold, buying new abilities and different weapon types.Took us around 9 hours to beat it from beginning to end, with a couple small breaks. Would recommend it to anyone, sit down with a friend or partner and just have fun! (And possibly some rage) I'm sure playing solo is fun aswell."

,Recommended,268910,35331921,Posted: 30 September,all,TheDaBombs,"If you like to be challenged, this is the game for you.If you don't like to be challenged, give this game a try. It is definitely worth the journey (at least where I'm at in the game currently) and the money.The game gives off this charming vibe that gives me a smile every time I start the game up. It feels unique and fresh in a sense, but gives a somewhat nostalgic feel to both games like Contra if you've ever played it, and grittier TV Cartoons like Balloon Land or Minnie the Moocher.Run-and-gun games like in the old days seemed to always be challenging. This game is no exception. The platforming levels test your abilities to quickly react to enemies coming onto the screen or to watch each corner of the screen in case of any flying projectiles that fly toward your direction. To top it off, the bosses (although some are a trial-and-error scenario) are very creative when it comes to their mechanics or how it tries to challenge players. One boss manages to be a duo where they trade off punches and enemies until one of them turns into a literal fan and the other throws deadly balls at you. Another boss has UFO's flying over your head with lights that damage you while shooting stars that hurt go toward you at the same time. Although the gameplay can be frustrating and irritating, the pay off of completing a run-and-gun platforming level or one of the bosses is very rewarding and worth it in the end.Aside from gameplay, there are different items that you can get that can help you through these levels like the Smoke Bomb (which I use personally) and the Scatter Shot. It helps you get through levels a bit quicker or safely, and you can always change it if you go back to the main map.One glance at the visuals of the game and you'll instantly think of those older cartoons that you used to watch as a kid, or of Disney movies that you may have seen in the past. Audio in this game solitifies that feeling as it pays homage to the old styles of music and effects you may have heard in those same cartoons. Everything about the game screams bright, colorful and creative. From the normal flower enemies on the first platforming section of the game to the insanely creative Boss Phases, the inspirations the game draws from older cartoons helps mold its own creative, gritty identity.TL;DR: The game is difficult yet very, very enjoyable. It is filled with great platforming levels and great boss set pieces. The audio and visuals are stunning and take inspiration from older cartoons which is refreshing to see.Although I haven't beaten the game yet, this game is a blast, and I hope to continue playing it for many days to come. Definitely worth it for the price tag it has. Hopefully some day soon I'll find someone to play Couch Co-op with."

These are my thoughts as a consumer, not a reviewer or a gamedeveloper.Cuphead runs like a charm and is fun to play. The fights are hard enough for a seasoned player and there's a ""more casual"" difficulty on the bossfights available for those who need practice. The easier mode _does not let the story go on_ The game is beautiful, and the characters boxes seem to be where they are supposed to be. So you only take damage when you are in a place to take damage. Altogether the game feels good. The controls are not exactly mint yet, to me they felt a tad bit laggy, or rather a bit off, especially when pressing jump, but i reckon a few updates from now, we'll probably be getting there. So far so good!Loading time on the first launch was semi long, me and my girlfriend both were talking about it like: ""Should it be taking this long?"" But soon i realized that the game just probably loads so many assets and different things to that first scene, it's not exactly optimized yet, or then again, it could be my toaster of a pc that's just doing these things to me.TLDR; A really great game, fun and includes a great story. Buying this game is definitely not a gamble, even with slight controller issues."
76561198052705243,Recommended,268910,35408423,Posted: 2 October,all,Yazu13,"Cuphead, a side-scrolling shooter with a focus on challenging boss encounters, is a beautiful, hand-written love letter to old-timey cartoons.  Inspired by the ragtime and jazz fever-dream of early 20th century animation, the game is a feast for the eyes and a whetstone for the senses.  A difficult shooter fest that dares you to keep up with the ever-increasing odds of its demanding duels and the sensory overload of its lavish presentation, Cuphead is instantly addicting, blindingly beautiful, and deeply rewarding.The game starts out as any good natured oldie would, as brothers Cuphead and Mugman hit a hot streak at the dice table in the Devil's own casino.  They're so lucky in fact, that the Devil himself joins their game and dares them to ante up their souls for a big payoff if they win.  Cuphead agrees beside his more reluctant brother, and throws the Devil's dice, losing the game by landing on snake-eyes.  When the Devil tries to collect, the brothers beg for another way to pay, and thus their journey begins as the Devil tasks them with collecting the souls of all his other debtors in exchange for getting to keep their souls.  It's charming, rife with toonish absurdity, and true to the old ""moral of the story"" style that many old cartoons were structured with.The game proper sees Cuphead (and Mugman if there is a second player) navigating an overworld map filled with kooky characters and animated props indicating a boss fight against one of the Devil's debtors.  When you stop at one of these props and start a fight, you're instantly assaulted with jazzy tunes and a larger than life cartoon boss, all in pitch-perfect style of old toons like Popeye and Betty Boop.  Each boss fight has multiple stages and can change up their rhythm in satisfying and surprising ways as well.  In true oldies fashion, many of the boss characters pull huge bombs out of pants pockets, transform into fighter planes, and move in crazy and creative ways as the battle ensues.  It keeps the player on their toes and deftly translates the trademark insanity of old cartoons into harrowing battles against unpredictable foes.Utilizing finger guns that shoot actual bullets, Cuphead can shoot in eight degrees, dash to avoid enemies, and perform a parry ability against pink-colored projectiles by pressing the jump button while in midair.  Parrying these pink objects (or simply hitting enemies with bullets) fills a super meter which can be used to unleash more powerful attacks and special abilities.  Being successful in the course of the game also nets you gold coins which can be spent on the overworld shop for equippable charms that give passive bonuses or new types of bullets such as homing bullets or a spread shot.  It never arms you to the teeth due to only being able to equip so many abilities at once, but it does give you new ways to tackle a tough boss in case the standard bullet type or charm isn't working as well as it did on the last boss.In so many ways, Cuphead is like what would happen if a time machine melded together with an arcade machine.  It's a twitchy and hard as nails side-scroller with an astonishingly crafted tone of emotive, old-timey drawings brought to life.  Nothing looks like this anymore, and bringing this aesthetic to life after so many decades of being lost is only a single reason why Cuphead is so special.  Even if you didn't grow up with the oldies, it's impossible to resist the meticulous style and refined game that is Cuphead.  It's a brisk trot through a wonderland of arcade dreams and irresistible cartoon energy, and it earns every moment of it."
,Recommended,268910,35424771,Posted: 2 October,all,hold your colour,"Before I bought the game I was intrigued by the '30s cartoon aesthetic and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the game packed more than nostalgic visuals. Cuphead handles really well once you get the feel of it; it's not exactly Super Meat Boy or Super Mario Bros but with a little bit of practice you can make really precise moves look easy and boy do you need to make precise moves. The game's difficult but most of the time it's difficult but fair. Rarely will you come across a move that feels random. You will however have to get through all the levels through trial and error and if you're not accustomed to precision platforming you will need lots of it. In the end though it felt really rewarding getting through the stages. There are a few bad design decisions namely foreground sprites that hinder your ability to see things coming at you and the lack of animations in the game's few ""cutscenes"" but that could be considered as a deliberate design decision and not as a flaw. I have also heard people criticise it on being short but I am not a believer of games that overstay their welcome and honestly Cuphead felt good at the 9 hours it took me to complete it on normal. If you aren't sold on the game I have to say that huge part of my enjoyment was the visual and auditory aspect of the game. That's not to say that the gameplay is lackluster but it's not extraordinary either. At 19.99 Cuphead is a somewhat short but nonetheless great experience that is worth buying if you love difficult games and the visual aesthetic."

I've never really been one to play 'difficult' games, but Cuphead has me sitting here replaying the same boss multiple times to beat it and not hesitating to restart and get a little farther that last time. When you finally beat one it is so satisfying and then I'm determined to beat it again and try to get a higher grade. Cuphead is a great game and at only $20 its a steal considering how much time the developers put into hand drawing the animations and the great gameplay that goes along with it."

(If Charge is ever nerfed it will be worthless, since it is only better than other shots if you land its once-every-couple-seconds blast.)Negatives:Too many attacks don't give you any warning as to their area of effect until it occurs, making too many first tries only trial runs you know you'll fail on. (See the double flamethrower on Werner or the tugboat's chargin' mah lazor attacks for instance.)Chaser is both bad at chasing and bad at damage, and if you are even moderately skilled at moving and shooting, you'll always want the pea shooter instead for sustained rapid-fire damage.Some projectiles are difficult to see or approach from unexpected directions or far too quickly. (Bone wheel on the train boss, flames from said boss.)Unexpected interactions with various parryable items/creatures. The octopus for instance most players will assume would hurt to touch.Parrying objects above you feels off. When it's underneath you can tell when to press the button, but above it's almost like Cuphead's hitbox extends too far vertically to reliably parry anything with ensuring it will collide into you mid parry, instead of parrying as you collide into it.Short. My playtime as of my first complete Regular playthrough was 4.6 hours.Some weapons or items have limited or seemingly no worth. I used lobber once, on the bee, and didn't even need to.Scrolling in multiplayer run n' gun levels is awful, as if players are too far apart the player in the lead will often take damage before being able to dodge out of the way.All of this said, this is the first game I have paid full price for in a long time without feeling ripped off, and if you have any confidence in your hand-eye coordination I think you should give it a shot."

To start, this game is absolutely drop dead gorgeous.  The animation and backdrops are straight out of the 1930's classical cartoon era with character designs and locations that would get a nod from Disney himself.  The soundtrack is an absolute delight, matching themes and tempo to the madness encountered on screen.This game is a scrolling shooter at heart and thank goodness, the developers decided to make it a ride that will have you gnashing your teeth while you dodge and shoot to keep your hide unscathed.  The controls are smooth, very responsive and the hit boxes spot on for this type of game.  The difficulty is obviously subjective to one's skill in shooter games.

The game itself is challenging but fair and even though you will die a bunch of times it never makes you want to stop playing it and each death will be your own fault.If I am to point out a flaw the parry system feels a little clunky and only seems to happen when it wants to which is a bit disappointing. There is an item you can get that makes you auto parry but when there's so many better choices it's worth skipping and you're better off playing with the 50-50 parry. I've had it happen a few times where I have parried but got hit at the same time and other times although I've timed it perfectly it still never came out and i end up getting hit. Ofcourse parrying is completely optional unless you're going for a high score or you're trying to reach a place which requires it.The tutorial is simple and teaches you everything to know at the start without treating you like an idiot. The level design also teaches you things as you go further into the game for example such as enemies balancing on balls where if you kill them the ball rolls on its own at a much faster pace making it more dangerous teaching you that some enemies are better off kept alive or the plane level when you get the bomb it has a downwards arc and the enemies place themselves in a way that swapping weapons frequently becomes optimal. I love that it teaches you things without popping them up on screen in neon colours like you're a game journalist who is incapable of following basic instructions or being able to learn things on your own."

I'm also a fan of how it's mostly bosses as they're usually my favorite part of other games.The Jazzy soundtrack is crazy good, too. You should get it asap."

,Recommended,268910,35478093,Posted: 4 October,all,Buzzo,"This game hits a difficult spot for me, because I absolutely adore the style, the music, the graphics, the stages, all of it.And if you can take a look at the negative reviews, it's just a bunch of people whining about the difficulty. Git gud or get out. It's not an easy game, but the ease of restarting a fight and learning boss patterns, level designs, types of enemies, etc. are all fine tuned and polished to a level I haven't seen since Overwatch.HOWEVER,From what I can see, both from playing and from the average time spent by players that review this game, it's not long by any sort of definition. I cleared the first world in under 2 hours, and although I can see a difficulty spike and plenty of more boss fights ahead, it doesn't seem like it's replayable. I hate likening it to Binding of Isaac, but that game had a million different ways to play it, whereas this has only several. The boss battles are great, but the problem is while THEY are very dynamic and malleable to change with each different stage — defeating one stage of a fight only to have to switch up your strategy completely is an absolute joy for a player imo — the PLAYSTYLE itself is so much of the same. I get it, it's a platformer, and to the developer's credit, they put in plenty of weapon modifications to try and switch it up, as well as not giving you a ton of money so you have to choose what you really want or need for an upcoming fight.It's a great game, and the developers have put in inordinate amounts of effort with the bosses, scenery, style, music, everything. They 100% deserve this upvote and have earned my approval easily. I feel like the game, however, struggles in terms of playstyle and replayability. So much of what the player does is the same, and there's not a ton of variation here, even with weapon modifiers. Additionally, I don't feel like the bosses are that hard after I've memorized their patterns, and for me that kind of kills it. In Dark Souls, for example, I could always do another run through with a new weapon, build, gameplay (i.e. SL1 or no armor), and it would always be at least a little different. I don't see a ton of that here, and that's why I'm most likely going to refund it. Not because I don't like it, but because, for $20, I want to be getting more than 13 hours of gameplay, and that's the absolute max I saw on reviews.TL;DR Music, bosses, level design, style, all fantastic. Low variability and replayabilty, and short game relative to the cost of $20."

,Recommended,268910,35473133,Posted: 4 October,all,A Crab man,"Spoiler free review!Honestly if this game doesn't get ""best indie game of the year"" award I'll eat my costly sock collection.I'm a huge fan of platforming games, I've always loved games like contra and metal slug where you combine the 2D platforming genre with shooting. Believe me when I tell you that every frame of this game looks amazing thanks to its really cool artstyle. Hell, even the loading screen is awesome! This game has apparently had one of the most insane ways of being created, where everything is HAND-DRAWN and every song for each boss is recorded live by a Jazzband and it's soundtrack is fantastic. The looks are amazing, the sound and music is amazing. And of course the gameplay is aswell. The game Is basically a boss-rush game featuring very unique and different bosses. All bosses are divided into different phases and every phase of the boss forces you to mix up your gameplay style. You buy upgrades and weapons then equip them in order to make you feel like this loadout will not only fit your playstyle but also give you an advantage as you take on these amazingly cool and DIFFICULT bosses.This game is not some average kid game, don't get fooled by the E for everyone or the looks. This game will mess you up. It's easily of the most challenging games I've played in a long time (about time...). You will die on your fist try (mostly), and that's ok. The game is meant to be a challenge. But you're human and hopefully you have the ability to adapt. You learn the moveset of the boss and hopefully will be able to beat them if you adapt to what they do. Then again, you could always beat them first try, if your reflexes allow you to. There are also some stages that are bossless and feature more of a run and gun feel where you're suppose to run across a stage with a bit of platforming and killing weeker enemies and somtimes fight a boss at the end(like contra) though these are . These are sometimes obligatory to progress and other times not. Lastly story. The story of the game isn't great but it atleast gives you a reason to fight the bosses. It's very straightforward but that's not really a problem.If you're stubborn like myself then this game won't be a problem for you It'll just take some time. All it takes is a little trial and error. I played this game solo on the regular then the expert difficulty and it was not easy, I can imagine that playing it with co-op would be alot easier since you can revive eachother but the online co-op will be released later on so it's only couch co-op right now. And one last thing.  Don't play the game on the easier difficulty since then you'll miss one of the bosses phases, in other words, you'll miss some content.Gameplay 10/10Looks 10/10Music 10/10Story 7/10Overall 9/10Really love this game and everything about it. Kickass soundtrack, tight gameplay and awesome looking and unique bosses.  I hope there will be some kind of DLC or even a sequel since this game is my new drug.It was totally worth the 3 year wait."

Each Boss stage has a damage threshold, meaning, you will have to do enough damage to progress to the next stage of the boss fight, but you can't necessarily just uber dps the boss to death on the first stage.3. This is a thinking shooter. Learn the patterns. Learn the tells regarding what attack is coming up. Once you know the fight, take a mulligan and restart if you take early damage.4.

,Recommended,268910,35333836,Posted: 30 September,all,polltery,"The biggest thing about this game is it's artwork. Gorgeous artwork, sound and music, so satisfying to look at and play with. Its a fun game that has less to do with all the annoying platforming precision. Its more about shooting your way out fights and levels. The game is mainly about boss fights (yes, no going through minions and stupid platforming), and upgrading your powers to fight smartly. There are some non-boss-fight with minions and platforming levels that help you earn coins which help you buy the right powers. There are also some unique levels with non-traditional fights. Its a really good balance that fits the game well. I've only played for 2 hours so I am yet to explore.The game is not very hard. Yes, you do die quite often, but only because you don't know the enemy attack patterns. Learning enemy attack pattern is not a chore because of how unique the artwork and animation is, its just fun to look at, after every boss transformation you happily wonder about it's next attack. If you do get stuck however, you can fight the boss in simple mode to make progress in the map. But to make progress towards end game you are required to fight the boss on regular difficulty.To get a good experience, I recommend that you update the mappings of the buttons (on your controller/keyboard) to what you will be quick with and also experiment different powers. Some powers suit some specific levels really well, so keep experimenting or read a guide online.One *very* small criticism is that when you fight as airplane its locked with default set of attacks. There is no way to customize the attacks of the airplane. And I also wished that I could map two different buttons for actions.I haven't tried the coop mode yet, but I imagine it will be super fun.Will update this review as I progress."

This game also has nostalgic music and great visuals similar to the original Micky Mouse and Popeye cartoons. It takes run and gun mechanics from games like Contra and adds a few new ideas to refresh these types of games. The new mechanics do not take away from the experiance, instead they build upon the experiance that you would expect from an old school run and gun platformer."

I thought ""Oh great, another commercial for something I wont have any interest in"". But then the 1930s cartoon style immediatly caught my eye. Not only were they going for something different from anything I've seen before, they completely NAILED it in every way and then some. Better yet, this game is hard. I mean Contra hard! This is a wonderful throwback to games that either made you a god among men or a crying sissy.Studio MDHR did a fantastic job on the gameplay. The controls are tight and responsive, when you die it only takes a second or two to reenter the fight, the fights are (for the most part) fair, powerups and such are useful and my god, those bosses are so good. Not only will they spank the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you, but they look awesome doing it. Also, the soundtrack is phenomenal and fits the theme perfectly!My only critiques so far are that the the game can feel claustrophobic because of how big everything is at times, you cant skip the intro screen and it seems like the game is pretty short (I'm only finishing up world 2 so I may update this later).9/10 Would get rekt by a flower again!"

The majority of the game is fighting bosses; there are a couple of platforming stages but they aren't necessary to finish the game. Most of the difficulty lies in learning the different attacks each boss uses. Some bosses take just 10 minutes to learn while others could take an hour or two- one of the later bosses took me a couple days to beat. The game can be very frustrating at times, but the satisfaction when you finally overcome the challenge is huge.Everything else about the game is fantastic. If you like games that are hard, if you think this game looks interesting, I highly recommend you check it out. It's a little bit short, but it's well worth the $20 for how much fun it is.The only issues that stick out in my mind:-The default controls suck. You'll need to change them.-A couple of bosses have RNG that can make them much harder. You can still adapt to this though.-There's a couple of bugs, but nothing game-breaking.-Spoiler regarding one of the bosses:The second-to-last boss is some real BS. That might be subjective though."

My only gripe with the game is that it's co-op based but it only has couch co-op it would be great if you could do co-op over wi-fi with your friends. It doesn't have to be a lobby join thing just a thing where you join your friends game to maybe help him out in a level.

,Recommended,268910,35323002,Posted: 29 September,all,Melody❤,"I absolutely loved this hand drawn game. I just finished it (alone).Pros;- Beautifully hand drawn stages with enemies and bosses.- Four Islands filled with many bosses to kill or to get killed by with messages by them if you get killed (them teasing you).- Each boss has a different stage or battle mechanics to them, it's not just the same constant attack over and over.- Co-op for those having trouble.- Each Island has a sort of theme for the bosses that you encounter.- You will need to think a bit about the weapons you bring to each encounter. Bringing the wrong weapons/perks can set the speed of the fight a lot slower than it needs to be.- After you're done with the game, try your luck with Expert mode is unlocked.- If you do die you can see how far you are towards the end with a progression marker.- The choice you're given at the end at the last boss fight.Cons;- (This depends on the person playing) Dying a lot, Yes you will die a lot though I think that's what makes it more enjoyable seeing how it's suppose to be hard.- There are a few bugs here and there to sort out though I'm sure they will get to it.- The island arent big (while the bosses you find on each island is great, I kind of wish there was a bit more)- There are only two stages on each of the four Island that are not boss battles (so six in total that are not boss fights).

The gameplay is fun as heck and hard too. It suffices my desire to play something so challenging, realizing you made a stupid mistake to go back and get your butt whooped again and again until its complete and you feel fulfilled, but also offers the requirement of even more challenge for getting perfect As or Ss on your fights without getting hit and sufficing the requirements for certain actions in the battle. It's a blast to play singleplayer, and I honestly cant wait until I get a friend to play with me, just to have a blast playing another hard as heck game but truly rewarding. Have to just give honorable mentions to Towerfall for being my rock as one of my favorite challenge and procision based games out there.

The developers went with a quality over quantity approach and boy did they provide.  The animators did a fantastic job, and I watched video where the person who did the painting, painted frame by frame, what dedication.

There’s been a ton of hype about it ever since it was first shown and the creators definitely delivered on expectations. For being a simple shoot’em up it’s really amazing how fun it is, the first night I played I hadn’t even noticed that 6 hours had past, I legitimately thought I had only been playing for about 3. The design choices for this game are what really sell everything about it. Nothing in this game is unique technically, all the ideas are a shout out to something else. Yet for every single fight in this game I was amazed by some simple thing they did that gave this game it’s own style. Yeah I don’t know, this game is uniquely unique. I highly recommend it."
,Recommended,268910,35390049,Posted: 1 October,all,(M3) Eildath,"The most damning thing about Cuphead is that every time you die - and you will - you know it's your fault.Cuphead is a love-letter to both 1930s-era animation - Silly Symphonies and Happy Harmonies, before Warner Bros. changed the game with Bugs and Daffy and the rest of the Looney Tunes. The entire game is rendered with art that would be totally at home in those cartoons, lovingly animated and filtered with the best film grain overlay I think I've ever seen. The music is pure 1930s and early 40s, with a lovely little opening ditty explaining the bare bones of the story and a nice sleazy blues tune for King Dice, the Devil's right hand man.The story is simple: Cuphead and Mugman lost their souls playing dice with the devil, and now have to collect the souls of debtors to earn back their own. It's not much more complicated than that, and it's told in storybook form between the game's four worlds. I haven't beaten it yet, but it has all the charm of one of those old cartoons, and about as much logic.The game, of course, is also a love letter to the hard as balls platformers and shooters many of us were raised on. It does not hold your hand. A screen of very easy tutorial is all you get, and it's all you need. Apart from buying a small selection of upgrades and power-ups, the five basic moves you learn in the tutorial are all you need to carry you thruogh the game: shoot, EX shot, jump, dash, parry, and stand still. Shooting things builds your EX meter (a hand of cards), which you can use for powerful shots or super moves you learn in bonus stages. You jump and dash to avoid enemies and shots, and you can parry pink shots/enemies/objects, which builds a full card of meter. You have three hit points. That is it. The rest of the game is boss fights and the occasional platform level, peppered with a few shooter levels that trade dashing for shrinking.The game is hard as balls, but it never feels unfair. The hitboxes are fair, the RNG doesn't stick you in a no-win situation unless you're careless with your own movement, and it's not a bullet hell memorization-fest. The controls are tight and responsive, and Cuphead and Mugman are maneuverable enough to reasonably dodge most anything thrown at them. It's hard, but satisfying. You will die. A lot. There are no lives and no game overs, but you do have to start over from the beginning of a level or boss when you die. None of them take more than 2 or 3 minutes from start to finish, however, or at least they don't for me. You'll spend a lot longer learning the boss's patterns and what strategies work best against each part of the boss, but when you win it's very satisfying.I can't reccommend this game enough, with the caveat that you have to have the patience for a really challenging game."

It's a very unique game that's easy to control, but hard to master. In every boss battle, as well as the Run an' Gun stages, you'll always be on the edge of your seat because one hit will take away from your miniscule health pool. I've died more than 400 times already in one sitting, yet I haven't even thought about quitting the game. Let me tell you, this game will test you, throwing different enemies and bosses at you that'll force you to either change your playstyle or loadout. The beauty of this game is that it you'll only blame yourself if you die. You question what you did wrong and how you'll improve upon that flaw, or you might've made a mistake that cost you your life. I've never blamed the game or its controls for my blunders, and that's amazing. Whenever I play this masterpiece, it absolutely screams 1930's cartoon art and music. For me, this is the perfect game and one of my all-time favorites. It's challenging, beautiful, rewarding, and hella' addicting. This game gives me that Megaman/Contra vibe, and that's absolutely welcome, especially for the older gamers that have played such games in their past. I played this game with my brother, and it was an absolute blast. This game is way, way more fun when you have someone to play with. We both enjoyed every second of it, although he complained that the levels and bosses were too hard. Yes, I may admit that some were harder than others and that we've died to them numerous times, but over-time you'll learn their moveset and pattern in each specific form, and all of those deaths will be worth it once that ""Knockout!"" pops up on your screen, right in your face. It's so satisfying! I've enjoyed this game from start, and I'm certain I'll continue to enjoy it until I finish it.Now I come to my conclusion. This game is F***in' AWESOME! 11/10"

It's nothing like Undertale or Donkey Kong Country (examples off the top of my head) but each track individually resinates perfectly with each boss, run 'n gun, just walking around and even in the store. It gives a warm welcoming feel to the environments.-It's hard. It's not a game you're gonna walk through easily in less than an hour, you will rage, you will get angry - but that's the beauty of Cuphead. It isn't just going to give you generic bosses and repeat them throughout the game. A kind of short game but compact with so many different elements all captured perfectly in every single level. It's hard, but it's not just hard for the sake of being hard like, for example, Dark Souls. It's hard to constantly challenge and push the player. You won't beat every boss within the first couple tries, it's going to take you a WHILE to figure out patterns for each boss.-The developers have clearly taken time and sunken hours into every little detail you will find, and you can tell instantly. Passion and care into every single individual aspect.-The storyline, it's not the most fascinating but it's straight to the point, you know exactly what's going on as soon as you start. It also fits in well to the 1930's cartoon style, this is something I could see being pulled straight from the likes of a cartoon from Max Fleischer. Even the bosses suit that era of cartoons where people would get their heads cut off, spooky skeletons everywhere and other absurd stuff that nowadays would get slandered by the mass media for being too ""offensive"".Cons:-There is a bug in the 2nd stage/world on Sugarland Shimmy where when you get to the final stage of the battle, you will never progress, when you die you will be stuck and unable to finish or beat the boss. If you try on the easier difficulty you can get to the end of the final stage but you won't be able to finish. You have to start over if you get it (I have not found a solution). Is has yet to be patched.-Some of the bosses rely purely on a set pattern so it kind of takes the fun out of facing them when you easily learn the pattern, I would of liked to see more bosses that are random in the sense that there is no pattern to what they do that can be learned, therefore making it easier (if that made sense I'm not sure.That's me nitpicking, this is a reletively flawless game, you can tell the dev team have worked incredibly hard to make this game as amazing as it is, which is refreshing since most companies usually opt for more money over making a solid game (Ark, H1Z1, CS:GO).9.4/10. If you enjoy a challenge, you are bound to enjoy Cuphead. If you can I suggest buying this game immediately. You will not be disappointed."

Being a large fan of the 1930s cartoon style, specifically Disney, it's a dream come true. From the moment the title sequence starts you feel taken backwards in time, down to the graininess of your entire screen.The game is unrelenting in difficulty, but that's not a bad thing being it forces you to learn the levels and take a specific approach to each one. Each boss has different moves making each battle unique enough to keep the game moving, but routine enough to learn and master a reaction. The hitboxes are EXACT and extremely fair.Should you buy this game because it was literally all hand-drawn in a depricated and classic art form frame by frame by frame? Should you buy this game because every inch of music was performed and recorded using period-piece instruments making an authentically sounding experience? Should you buy this game because $19.99 is an absolute steal? All of the above.Bravo Studio MDHR!"

The last game that managed to do that to me was Dark Souls.I also have to mention I'm not really into indie games but this one really got to my heart and actually ended up being one of my all time favorite games, even though I'm not even close to finishing the game.Can't say much about the controls cause I was scared trying the game with the keyboard. The bindings feel really good on the controller though.One thing I'd like to request though is to add the option to switch monitors.

,Recommended,268910,35482235,Posted: 4 October,all,JeneralBen,"First off, I really appreciate what this studio has done in terms of graphics and music.  A+ on that.I also appreciate the difficulty.The mechanics are great.  Bosses usually telegraph moves well enough that you don't have to learn by trial and error.  Some mechanics give the player choice in how the battle unfolds (do you want more difficulty with more opportunities to parry?)However, I think there could have been a few game design tweaks that would have made the game more enjoyable while maintaining a high level of difficulty.1) hitboxes are a little stingy.  With tiny bullets and only 8 directions of fire, it can be very difficult to hit enemies while you are trying to juggle the rest of the action.2) jump control.  The highest jump and lowest jump you can do only differ by about half of cuphead's height (probably a little more).  The ability to hop would help give the user more options instead of forcing a jump that results in a mid-air collision (basically a no-win situation sometimes).3) parry only works at the jump apex.  Split second timing, tiny range, AND only works at the top of the jump?  Any two of these would be fine, but all three seems a bit much.5 stars."

There is no other way to describe this game except that it's fantastic. But I sure as hell am gonna try.Cuphead, from Studio MDHR is a run n' gun type platformer akin to the likes of megaman and the sort. The difference between this and a *WHOLE* lot of other games in the genre is just how outstandingly polished and fun to play it is. First off, the visuals, the animations were all hand-drawn and meant to replicate the classic era of cartoons around the 1930's. This matched with Beautiful watercolor backgrounds and a grainy, film-damaged aesthetic running throughout the entire game, it gives this game a charm that is found in no other. Every part of the aesthetics were perfectly planned out and executed with such a sheer amount of dedication that it baffles me. But if the game's terrible then you may as well watch a movie, right? Good news everyone, Cuphead plays fantastically as well. In my 11-hour playthrough (consisting of mostly deaths, More on that later) I've had the pleasure of experiencing cuphead's tight controls and fluid moveset. The Parry-Slap is very satisfying to use and can give the skilled player an upper hand in combat, and The dash is necessary for most of the game, much like in Megaman X. The downside being you can't dash cancel but I really didn't expect them to do it anyways. The difficulty of cuphead is bonkers. Like, Ball-bustingly-tear-your-hair-out kind of difficult. The difference between this and something like the ""Difficulty"" of dark souls is that any mistake the player makes is on them. Every boss in the game is achievable if you understand the pattern. There can be times that the game looks to go insane with how many obstacles are on screen at once, but there is really just a simple pattern for most fights that you need to follow, even when projectiles fill the screen, a keen eye will notice quite a few openings in attack patterns.Now onto what little amount of bad things in this game: One main problem I had was the feeling of time wasted on some bosses. I spent a ton of time on some of these, mainly due to repeatedly dying. With having such high stakes in a game without any health regeneration items, 3-4 hits can really feel like not enough sometimes.To sum it up, Cuphead is a beautiful demonstration of animation and game design. Masterfully crafted art style, music, and platforming put into a blender with Pac-man shaped eyes, and despite some flaws, still shattered my expectations to the point where it's now in the running for my game of the year. I highly recommend purchasing this game if you haven’t already. Solid 9/10"

,Recommended,268910,35321281,Posted: 29 September,all,InVader,"Possibly the most adorable game on Steam.Basically Ghost Rider becomes a 30s Disney cartoon. They nailed the 30s Disney style, including the music. All the animations were made on paper and inked too, to give them that authentic look (I don't envy the devs, must have been a pain in the a$$).As for the gameplay, it's pretty tough. The difficulty doesn't really come from your usual bullet hell, but smart enemies or projectiles instead - this is the mark of truly well designed combat in a 2D platformers! Enemies will sometimes zone out half the screen, while you have to dodge homing projectiles, while you have to shoot the enemie's weakspot, while you have to parry pink attacks either for energy or because there's no other way out. Yes, all of this at the same time.There's 2 types of levels:Run&Gun - classic  levels where you need to push through enemies to reach the end of the level. Features minibossesBoss fights - multiple phases, and the bosses attacks are randomized too (the phases are not!). Let me explain: For example the genie boss in the first phase will always open a treasure chest, but the treasure chest will sometimes attack using swords (they charge at you) or random bling (bullet hell) or golden cats (homing swarm missiles). Every time you start the bossfight you get a different attack in that first phase (and others as well) but he always opens that treasure chest in the first phase, so the phases themselves stay in order.There's LOADS of boss fights. More than run&gun levels, which is actually a shame. I love the run&gun levels, because those feature respawning enemies, so sometimes it's a bit more challenging. It's not about learning attack patterns like in the boss fights.I failed a lot and tried to ace some levels too, so considering that I completed the game in 9 hours. You know this game is good when I did this in one sitting playing until 6AM. If you were to complete each level on 1st try, it could be about... 4-5 hours maybe? That's not likely to happen though, even on easy mode.Minor complaint: coop is local only."

First of all it charges your ex ability or whatever its called, which is quite a lifesaver if used right. 2nd - it lets you jump higher and further. 3 - it can block some attacks. If that's not enough for you, I don't know what is.The character is rather slow only until you start truly utilizing your dash, which boosts you drastically. It is very easy to overlook the dash at the start, but the further you go - the more crucial its mastery becomes.The game IS difficult and the ability to practise bosses on an easier difficulty is nice, since it lets you prepare to some boss forms that would catch you off guard on a successful run. And don't forget - the game is a boss fighter. The run'n'gun levels are simply there to open a new path and give you a few coins for upgrades. And yes, completing easy versions of bosses lets you advance through the map as well.The upgrade system is neat and allows for quite some combinations. It is by no means a key feature of the game, which is boss fights. They could've dismissed upgrades alltogether and it'd still be a ton of fun.And yes, did I mention that the game is very difficult? There are often scenarios where you might think that you can't escape the damage, but that can only mean one of 3 things. 1) You've trapped yourself, 2) You didn't master some mechanics enough, 3) You forgot about some mechanic.And you can't just use your abilities whenever you feel like it, after all, there's a separated invulnerability ultimate for a purpose of defense. All others must be used with caution.P.S. While bosses usually have some degree of random, if you plan your movements accordingly - you can always evade."

Even though you will get beaten more than once, you definitely will wanna come back to finish that level. The amount of hardwork the devs put in thsi game is just awesome!Visuals:Absolutely stunning. Literally took me to my childhood when I was watching Tom and Jerry on Cartoon Network. Nostlagic is the one word that is more than enough to describe this. Brilliant job guys!Sound and Music:Sounds are spot on. With each movement resulting in either a ping, or the crash of china on the floor when you get his, this game has perfected sound with its animations.Music is absolutely gorgeous to listen to, although most of your attention will be on the screen rather than on the ears.Animation:Solid movements from each character and not a single hitch or bug was present.Controls:Smooth, albeit a little difficult to figure out the combinations at first. Responsive enough to overcome the daunting challenges that you'll face in this game.CONS:My only cons are there seems to be a problem with the hit boxes sometimes. Especially while aiming up. The hitbox is really small for the objects, animals, creatures that are vertically above you with respect to their sides. I would hit the wing of a firefly, but it wouldn't die. This is the only bug I found in thsi gameCONCLUSION:One of the best indie games I've played in a while And guys, read the developers story.

As always, not impossible or whatsoever but they're just there to give you a reason to get coins or some no damage run. Majority of bosses are amazing on their own, sadly a very few are questionable at best. Parries can't be consistent but luckily there's a Charm that helps you with that.  That's it for negative look.Game has amazing visuals, music and all. Bosses are memorable and have their own amazing animation and game over quotes. It's also a good way to relieve the 1930s.Don't be afraid of using Simple mode despite having some phases cut, a good side of Simple mode is being able to unlock the roads faster and learning the patterns of said phases. When you feel you can do better, Regular mode all the way."

The artstyle is simply gorgeous, and the controls are spot on. The game is hard and unforgiving, but not in an unfair manner. If you die, it is your fault. The only major complain I have, is that the bossfights are pretty much trial and error. You wont beat any boss in your first try, because you don't know what attack they pull of. But once you've seen every attack, and learn how to evade it, the game just becomes a very challenging indeed but also very fun platformer.2 things I suggest that could be added are:- Include the option to play as either Cuphead or Mugman (So you can save 2 different kinds of builds and swap between them quickly)- In the equip menu, add a preview of the shots/supers, so you dont have to enter a level just to see what it is really likeTL;DR game is gud, buy it"

,Recommended,268910,35530970,Posted: 6 October,all,Clarque,"Cupheadis an indie precision platformer made by StudioMDHR. In Cuphead, you find yourself making a deal with the Devil after a night of gambling goes south. You're tasked with collecting a number of Soul Contracts in exchange for your own souls. The deal struck, Cuphead and his pal Mugman set off to collect on these contracts.-----Story & CinematicsThe story of Cuphead is a trope we see all too often. ""Collect these things to advance, go fight the Big Bad Evil Guy."" That being said, there was enough of a premise to understandwhyyou're doing what you're doing. There is a bit of a twist at the end,where you can choose to give the Devil the collected contracts or refuse and fight him. All in all, the story was what it needed to be: enough to let you know why but not too much so you weren't taken away from the gameplay.The cinematics were portrayed in the style of the 1930's cartoons, as a storybook. The game opens with a book opening to reveal the intro to the game, explaining Cuphead and Mugman's night gambling in a children's storybook fashion, turning pages and all. This continues throughout the game whenever exposition is needed.GameplayCuphead is a sidescrolling platformer, which I will be the first to admit that the market is flooded with these at the moment. However, there are a number of unique twists to Cuphead that make it stand out from the crowd. First, the level to boss ratio is skewed in favor of bosses. Inkwell Isle, the setting of the game, is separated into four worlds. With the exception of the final world, each world has between 5 and 7 bosses and 2 ""Run & Gun"" levels.The R&G levels are primarily there to net you coins, which you can then spend at Porkrind's Emporium for new guns and charms. Guns are different attacks ranging from a homing shot all the way to a shot that you have to aim behind you to utilize it to its full potential. The charms are small gameplay modifiers that will grand you additional HP, automatically perform certain moves, and other things that help you in your adventure. One part of these items that I really enjoy is the requirement to mix and match these items to maximize your effectiveness against different bosses.The bosses themselves are a test of your skills. Each boss is unique, bringing out different movesets and multiple forms. Some bosses will be fought on a constantly changing array of shifting platforms. Others will be fought in the air, with Cuphead and Mugman manning biplanes and slinging bullets at the bosses à la the Gradius games.It's no secret that this game is hard as hell. On your first playthrough you'll die repeatedly. Think of it as a learning experience; while you're banging your head against the proverbial wall of a boss, you're learning their patterns and the best way to defeat them. Every time I defeated a boss was extremely satisfying. The difficulty curve is steep, for sure, but I rarely found myself blaming the game for that. It was more player naïveté than bad mechanics.There are two modes to the boss fights - Simple and Regular. Simple mode will take away certain boss phases and result in a shorter boss fights. The catch to this is you will be unable to access the final world unless you beat all of the bosses in Regular mode.ControlsThe controls are tight, which was honestly a surprise for me going in. My only complaint was the dash and EX move buttons are located on Y and B respectively. I'm pretty sure they were trying to go for an old school SNES feel by using only the bumpers and not the triggers. Soon after I started the game I rebound those two moves to the triggers and at once the controls felt intuitive. With the graphics using rubber hose animation I thought that there would be an abundance of frames which would make judging distance and trying to land precision jumps hard, but those fears were unfounded. The animations complement the controls perfectly.GraphicsCuphead's primary appeal is its aesthetic. Designed after 1930's cartoons using the rubber hose animation, it's very appealing to the eye. Those childish graphics are a little misleading though, and give off the impression that this game is geared towards kids. That's probably not the case unless your kid is hopped up on too many bowls of Fruity Pebbles.The backgrounds look almost hand painted. The characters and interactive objects are animated slightly, making them move just slightly enough to stand out from the backgrounds themselves while looking like they belong. It's a great contrast to see and is very visually appealing.Music & SoundsThe soundtrack to Cuphead is amazing. A mix of big band, jazz, and ragtime, it keeps the energy up while you're fighting bosses and traversing through levels. There's a slight sound meant to be a gramophone needle which further adds to the overall feel of the game. I did find myself tiring of the music if I was stuck on a particular boss, grumbling under my breath that I was ""sick and tired of this ♥♥♥♥ing Chips Ahoy music"". It never truly grated on my nerves though. I think anyone would get tired of a song after listening to it on a loop for two hours.-----Final ThoughtsCuphead is a top contender for my favorite game of the year. It was a long time in the making but I'm glad they decided to pull it back and polish it. If you're a fan of Contra and enjoy Steamboat Willie, this game is definitely for you. It's a lot of fun and enough of a challenge to give you that intense rush of satisfaction while you play it. I'm definitely happy with this purchase and happily recommend it to my friends."

,Recommended,268910,35337310,Posted: 30 September,all,Shinji16,"I'm only in chapter one and will edit this review if needed, but I want to get an ""early"" review here for anyone on the fence about this game.Cuphead is an absolute gem. Yes, it has gotten a lot of attention for its art style, and yes, the visuals are spot on for old cartoons. However, it's not just the visuals that are great; the sound design, mechanics, and overall gameplay have each been equally polished and honed to razor's edge. The controls feel insanely responsive, and so far I have never felt like a death wasn't my fault. Also, and very importantly due to the game's unapologetic difficulty, while the sound and visuals have a clearly artistic bent, they also still convey the needed info about what's happening in the game.While the difficulty is hard, and I say this as a fan of shmups and danmaku, the game is fair. Normally shmups start with very easy material and then slowly ramp up. From what I've seen in other reviews and in my own gameplay, I feel it's more accurate to say Cuphead starts with what would be considered (in terms of difficulty) medium or mid-game material. However, the first bosses and run 'n' gun levels are designed to help cement the overall controls, concepts and mechanics you'll need to succeed. So while you might have a little trouble in the beginning, know that this is a game that hits the ground running, and your initiall successes will be both hard fought for but definitive stepping stones that will have prepared you for the challenges ahead.I cannot stress enough that while the developers had an artistc goal and nailed it, they also nailed every other facet of the game as well. If you're debating getting this game, pull the trigger as Cuphead delivers fun on so many fronts."
,Recommended,268910,35394559,Posted: 1 October,all,Rob27shred,"This game is well worth the $20 asking price, if you're interested in this game in the slightest my advice would be to take the plunge & buy it! Great creative art style, interesting story (albeit shallow & inconseqential to the gameplay), very smooth gameplay, good level design, funny & rememberable bosses, near perfect diffuclty curve IMO. I could go on & on about this game there is just a ton of positives with very few negatives to it in my eyes.The only things I could see people finding negative about it are it is very difficult by today's standards (old school gamers, you'll be fine & right at home with this platformer/shooter mash up) & it can be pretty repetitive because of that. Although the devs did add in the simple diffculty on boss stages to help alleviate that. The simple difficulty allows you to get used to the bosses moves in it's different stages & I believe it allows you to unlock parts of the map as well. But you have to beat all the bosses in regular difficulty to get their soul contracts & actually beat the game. Other than that I can't think of much else to complain about here.Overall I would give Cuphead a 9/10, it's a really fun & challenging game that I think any gamer would have blast playing!"

You also get assigned a rank after each level and that made me always challenge my previous best score and try to improve. One gripe I have with the gameplay is the parrying system. I don't feel like I used it that often in my gameplay so far and I don't feel like I need to. The fluidity of the gameplay is also very nice. It tests your reactions and really makes you focus on each button press and on screen actions.RATING = 9/10Music and SoundI love the soundtrack of this game. It really clicks and meshes with the artstyle and the actions of the bosses. The soundtrack felt really well thought out and planned while also not feeling forced. It felt like something I would honestly listen to in that setting. I love the soundtrack of Shovel Knight so this soundtrack really brings back that feeling.RATING = 10/10ConclusionCuphead is a fantastic game. I love it to death and will probably dump more hours in trying to get an all S run on the bosses and the Run & Gun stages. Everything feels considered in the game and the mechanics all feel semi usable or essential. I hope to see more games of this quality from the developers and I can't wait for the expansions later in the cycle of this game.RATING = 10/10TL:DR = Buy this work of art right now."

You take control over the titular character (and if you have friends, like I don't, you can play local coop mode with your buddy Mugman) and you try to defeat a bunch of bosses, because you need their stuff :PNow, I was waiting for this game for years, I was afraid that it might end up being poopy like some other games in the past with infinitely long development process (cough cough, Duke Nukem Forever, No Man's Sky...), but I'm happy to report that Cuphead is just awesome!Everything is great about it. Crazy, hand drawn (!) animations, beautiful soundtrack, hilarious cartoonish sound effects, fluent controls, insane multistaged bosses with the most over the top goofy attacks, upgrades to your loadout, special powerful attacks, dash/parry system and so on and so forth :PThe difficulty is high and you can adjust it before starting each boss battle. It's based on patterns recognition and your reflexes, this way you rarely feel like you've been screwed by RNG. You're going to die. A lot. But I just can't get mad at this game for killing me mercilessly when everything is so cheerful, colorful and cute :P It definetely has 'just one more try' syndrome and it's great. You want to kick the enemy's butt and when you do you feel amazing! And then you go to the next beautifully animated boss battle and you get the crap kicked out of you again, the cycle never ends and you're happy to be a part of this pandemonium :)So Cuphead.

,Recommended,268910,35318555,Posted: 29 September,all,Kiyosuki,"This game is Contra. It's literally just Contra with a slick 1930's animation aesthetic.But that's not a bad thing. It's reminding people of what real challenge in a platformer looks like the same way the Souls games brought back challenge to 3D action rpgs and dungeon crawlers. It's definitely quite hard, but never so hard that it feels like it's unfair or impossible and with unlimited retries (but nontheless, no check points during stages) you have ample time to adapt to the rather brutal but possible trial and error. Although the visuals are what really got this game on the map, the actual game within it is just as strong. With a plethora of power ups, attacks, tactical moves, and so on and a simple but adataple range of actions you never at least feel incapable.So far I've run into few if any bugs, although I've heard of the game having a few. I'm sure patches will help but it doesn't seem to be a glaring problem.The aesthetic though is indeed the big draw here though. So much obvious thought and work was put into painstakingly recreating the look of an old cartoon complete with choppy audio and primitive sounding voice clips. Every single boss so far have been amazing character designs. The music is an old-time jazzy soundtrack indicitive of the expected time period.If you're looking for an extremely challenging but nonetheless fun video game, that truly feels like a video game, with an extremely unique aesthetic I'd definitely give this a shot, especially considering the low price tag."

,Recommended,268910,35396481,Posted: 1 October,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Cuphead has been a highly anticipated release for the better part of three years now. The publisher/developer, StudioMDHR Entertainment, launched the game's campaign initially in January 2014, and at the time set a release date expectation of 2014. After numerous delays that pushed the title into 2015, then 2016, and finally 2017, gamers were understandably beginning to wonder if the difficult 1930's cartoon inspired platformer would actually see the light of day. Without a doubt, the patience of the public has finally paid off, and Cuphead hit the market on September 29, 2017.The story is not one that is overbearing, and there are only a handful of cutscenes throughout the game; all of which can be found after beating one level and moving on to the next. Cuphead and Mugman have found themselves at the Devil's Casino, and they're on a big winning streak. The devil appears and challenges them to one last roll of the dice with a catch; if they win they take everything he owns, but if they lose their souls are his. Of course the devil wins, but when Cuphead and Mugman plead for their souls, the devil sends them out around the Inkwell Isles to gain soul contracts from various other characters.Inarguably, the aesthetics of Cuphead are extremely pleasing to the eye to anyone that has a nostalgic soft spot for the look and feel of 1930-1940's era of animation. The backgrounds are all lovingly handcrafted with soft, yet gritty,  pastel colors. While the characters and enemies are rendered in the same fashion, they have a cartoony brightness to them to make them stand out dominantly against the mix of stagnant and scrolling screens. The two progagonists, Cuphead and Mugman, are comprised of simple shapes and colors, leaving your eye to comfortably explore the landscapes and foes rather than focus on them. Additionally, the soundtrack is nothing but complimentary to the retro style, bringing a mix of upbeat swing jazz, orchestra, and classy noir soundscapes; I should also mention, it's all performed by real musicians using live instruments, not synthesizers. Every composition is unique only to the game, along with a few tracks that feature a singing quartet. All in all, you will have no problem feeling like you are back in the golden oldie days while playing this title.The controls are, for the most part, very smooth and fluid, although the buttons are not rebindable at the moment. This is definitely a game that is best played with a controller, so keyboard + mouse elitists be warned. Of course you have your standard jump and shoot buttons, but you're also able to parry objects that glow bright pinks by double jumping on them, as well as use special moves to deal extra damage to foes. You can also duck and jump-dash as well. There are several upgrades that can be purchased from an in-game shop, using in-game coins that are collected from a handful of levels, many of which come with new attacks that range in both power and reach, along with charms that have various effects. At any time while on the map screen, players are able to interchange attacks, special moves, and charms, in which finding the right combination is crucial to advancing within some levels.With all of that being said, Cuphead is not a game that will appeal to everyone. This is primarily due to its perceived difficulty which has been rated to the levels of old school Megaman titles. Though I personally did not find the game to be that difficult, it still does present a devilish challenge; especially to those who may be used to the comparative ease of modern gaming. It will, however, appeal to those who enjoy a more hardcore platformer/side-scroller/shoot 'em up, along with those that enjoy a good co-op title. Be forewarned, though, that this game only comes with local co-op, which can be an unfortunate downside for gamers with long distance cooperative buddies.For all of the good that it possesses, this title still has areas where it can improve. For anyone going in to Cuphead thinking that it will be a side-scrolling platformer akin to Megaman, throw that idea out the window. The majority of levels are simply boss-oriented, meaning that you will find yourself on a stagnant screen, fighting a boss through its various phases. There are only a handful of ""run-and-gun"" platforming levels, and each one of those has their own mini-boss at the end. Therefore, you will spend the biggest majority of your time facing one-on-one bosses. Additionally, if you're playing solo, you only have the option to play as Cuphead and you will never see Mugman unless you have a local friend to play with. It would be nice to have the option to switch between the two characters, but alas that is not the case.There's also no incentive to do your best. Cuphead grades you at the end of each level by your remaining health, how many super move slots you earned, your total time, and if it's a ""run-and-gun"" level also by how many coins you found. Unless you're really in to achievements, there's no reason to stress yourself to get that perfect A+/S ranking, as there are no unlocks of any kind to be had. The only thing that comes close is unlocking Expert difficulty after beating the game, but even then there is little point unless you're die-hard. This is much more of a disappointment than not being able to freely play as Mughead, as many older games did provide unlockables or alternate endings to some degree.Though Cuphead does come with its share of hits and misses, it's still an outstanding adventure through the long forgotten, yet still wholly beloved, era of a simplier time. The inclusion of things that are banned in cartoons of this day and age, such as cigars and gambling, are a really nice touch that just add to the nostalgic factor. With a little bit of hope, the developer will listen to feedback and hopefully include more platforming levels in the next installment, if there is one, rather than an over-abundance of one-on-one boss levels. If you enjoy difficult titles, then Cuphead is for you, but do not believe all of the reviews that compare this game to Megaman or any other game of that nature, as this beast is a monstrosity entirely its own.Rating:4.0/5.0- Excellent, highly worth playing.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Cuphead's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Cuphead & Cuphead fans truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Cuphead which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jared Moldenhauer's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer/television screens.

,Recommended,268910,35361157,Posted: 30 September,all,Monokuli,"TL;DR: A great Run & Gun game with amazing graphics and great music, with extreme hard but fair difficulty.A Must-Buy for every Retro-Gamer.Cuphead ""Don't Deal With The Devil"".After 3 years of waiting for it's release, the wait was worth, as it deliveres the perfect Run & Gun Gameplay I've been wanting soo much to be revived. Hopefuly, we'll have more Run & Gun games in the future that will follow Cuphead's steps.Let's get the obvious out of the way:Graphics: Fantastic! If you're a fan of old 1930 cartoons, you'll love the unique art style that this game proudly shows, as everything in this game is made by hand-drawing. Everything is beautiful to look at and the animation is greatly detailed. Definitly it's strongest point.Gameplay: Simple as it can get. You dodge everything that is thrown to you and shoot down your enemies. Like old fashion, the bosses don't have any health indicator, as it should be, but clues are thrown into the mix, like becoming more aggressive, or changing their forms. There is a variety of weaponry you can choose, and end up being used at least once for a specific boss, and along side weapons, there are charms that can help you with sustaining damage or dodging projectiles or enemies.Dificulty: Now here's a tricky one. Retro games (Specially Run & Guns) were always easy to learn, hard to master. Cuphead is one of those cases where you'll die alot, but it's never the games fault. Do not pay attention to the people who say the game is too hard or is too unfair. Nothing in the game is unfair. It can and will get hard the more you acomplish, but when you die, you learn from your mistake. You start memorizing the bosses's attack patterns, and the more you study them, the easier it gets. It's not a final exam, but memorizing the attacks always help. It's how most Run & Gun games work.Audio: The sounds are satisfying to listen to, and the music is amazing. It really captures the old instrumental vibe that every 30's cartoon had. I can guarantee you, it won't go through your head to turn the volume down or to even turn the music off. It is that good to listen to. And never 2 musics are the same, every stage and worlds have their own unique theme.Replayability: In the end of every level, you'll be graded depending on how good you do. You can always replay the same levels to aim for a higher grade. There is also the Expert Mode, where it changes the bosses attack patterns, by making them faster or stronger. It actually has a 200% Completion, so see if you can beat all the bosses in a higher difficulty, see if you know your Cupheaded ways.Final Thoughts: It is an amazing game that I recomend for every Retro fan to get. The difficulty is insane, but fair and passable, altho sometimes it might be annoying, but not game-breaking. Haven't run to any game bugs, and it runs at 60 stable FPS. Great graphics, amazing music and tight and responsive controls.Verdict: 9/10"

The game is mostly one huge boss rush with only 6-8 run and gun stages and around 17 bosses to fight, each boss feels like it has been well thought out what with what the bosses them is, varying from crazy plants to a dragon and many other crazy things.The difficulty is certainly challenging and takes a little bit to get used to when things start to ramp up and whenever I died I didn't blame the game often, It just felt like a fair process of learning what to do in each boss fight the hard way!Cons:The only issues I see people having with this game is that it kind of has no replay value and gets repetitive, I mean you do unlock a new difficulty after you beat the final boss and some people will just drop the game after the final fight, not bothering to play the new difficulty unlocked. (This is a issue some players will have, although some people won't mind doing it all again on a harder difficulty like myself.)I recommend the game for what it is, a fun little game that you can burn some time with."

But then the more you are away from it the more you think, maybe Cuphead has changed, maybe I can finish that boss. So you go back with a smile on your face, you buy an upgrade and tell yourself this time it will be different, things have changed. You die over and over until you start yelling out, people around you look, you continue to die and scream abuse at Cuphead for not making that parry.

,Recommended,268910,35452307,Posted: 3 October,all,cheer,"Cuphead.Where should I start?Well Cuphead is an as you probably already have seen, a Game with the Art style of the 1930s Cartoons like the old Mickey Mouse and Stuff. That's what I love about it. It's about 2 Brothers named Cuphead and Mugman and they have to fight through levels and bosses to don't lose their souls. I just started it and already loved it. It reminds me to my childhood with all those old cartoons (even if im not born in the 1930s I still watched it). Although this game is really hard some even compare it with Dark Souls im not sure if I can agree with that but one thing I've noticed: It's really hard! :D Every level is in it's own kind its always the same goal but always something new and that causes the ""WOW"" effect. I still didn't played that much but I think this changes in the next few days/weeks. If you love the old cartoons and like 2D Indie Shot n Gun Games? Then I highly recommend it to you. If you don't have any patience and you rage pretty fast it's maybe something for you (even if I rage pretty fast I cant rage in this game it seems to lovely to me xD) I recommend to play it with an controller because the mouse and keyboard controls are crap. literally. Sadly it doesn't has an online mode online local coop that's not that great because I'd loved to play with my friend but sadly we can't :( Maybe they change it in the future. But after all I love this game I hope a second game will follow up that's exactly that good maybe even better ;)"

And you can get upgrades for your character by getting coins in the Run & Gun levels and then going to a store to buy them. Those upgrades significantly change the way the game goes,so you can replay the levels differently and get better grades,raising the replay value of the game. There is only one problem. From the first world to the second,the difficulty gets too high too fast,so the game is too hard to complete. I've got through the first world,but I don't know if I'll be able to finish the game. It still a good game tho,you can get it and replay the first world over and over again and try to get through the second from times and times.

The gameplay is frustratingly hard but just like DS if one learns the patterns they can eventually crush the bosses. It's really satisfying to beat a difficult boss. There's also a small variety of weapons and ""charms"" (permenant small power ups) that can bemix and matched for each boss that allow strategies to develop and cooperation with other fans to figure out the optimal strategies. Lastly, there's couch co-op which is wonderful in today's game market.The Bad: Personally, I found the difficulty progression to be a little inconsistant with a world 2 boss that's harder than some world 3 bosses. and a way to easy world 4 boss. But that's subjective so I'll leave it out of the considerations for my final rating. In addition, there's no online co-op, but that's something that I expect the devs will add eventually.Final verdict: 10/10  The game is a masterpiece and it's few tiny cons don't impact anything enough to make the game less than perfection."

76561198044011993,Recommended,268910,35325128,Posted: 29 September,all,"Dirk Claymore, The Tartan Menace","Brilliant game. If you're into 2d bullet hell games, this is a must. Good difficulty, but not impossible (think dark souls, not super meat boy). The visuals are incredible, and are all hand drawn, the music is one of my favorite ever-mostly big band and jazz, each level with it's own soundtracks, and overall it created a awesome feeling of the late 30's in video game form.It plays well, but I do feel like pointing out it's MOSTLY a boss rush. There are some of the more traditional side scrolling ones, but those are in the minority. Most of the time you will find yourself fighting multistage bosses, which I personally love, but I can see how some people might find that a bit off putting.The only downsides in my opinion is that there is sometimes some difficulty hitting a few of the smaller enemies above you, which led to some of the only times I was angry at the game rather than myself for dying, and the tutorial is...not fantastic.It does show movement well enough, but it does a poor job of explaining counters and supers. (so I'm going to right now). You have a set of cards tha tyou build up in the bottom corner of the screen, as you hit things, they build up. One card can be used for a weapon dependant ult, or the full se tfor a super ult. ANYTHING pink can be countered to instantly gain a full card. I tdoes tell you that pink things can be countered, but it only shows little dots, you can actually counter worms, bullets, enemies, anything pink. Just putting that out there because I had some confusion with that myself, and I started enjoying the game much more once I got that.Anywhoo, Fantastic game, must buy if you are into this genre, I would say if I had to give it a number maybe 9-10/10."

Cuphead, blinded by a large winning streak at the craps table, decides to make a bet with the devil, and obviously he loses. As a result, Cuphead and Mugman are forced to hunt down and collect the souls of the Devil's other debtors, whom will serve as your bosses. A simple story that the developers make sure isn't sidelined during the course of the game, which is nice.Graphics and Audio:This game's graphics and audio is a shining example of the passion that Studio MDHR had for this project. Each character, animation, background, and so on is hand drawn in that sort of iconic 1930's cartoon style and not once is the illusion that you're playing a cartoon ever lost or even skewed. The game is absolutely gorgeous to look at and the sound design is even better. With the 1930's and the sort of limitation of technology of the time, sound quality in media was often grainy and sort of muted. This fact remains with Cuphead, but the beauty of this sort of sub par and scratchy sound is that it in fact even improves the immersiveness of the game. The music is exceptional and sounds like it's ripped straight from a record of the era, from the somber barbershop quartet singing about cuphead's woes on the game's title screen, to frantic and upbeat big band tracks that seem almost neverending as you run jump and shoot your way through a wild boss battle.GameplayI'm not going to do the usual ""this game is like dark souls"" thing. This game is DIFFICULT. Sometimes infuriatingly so, but the beauty of the game's inherent ""just one more try"" design is that Studio MDHR knows exactly how to keep you glued to it, and in this case it's as simple as showing you how close you are to the end of a fight if you die at any point. It's a tease, it's engrossing, and it works. As far as the controls go I'd recommend playing the game with a controller as the game was clearly developed with this type of scheme in mind. The controls are super tight and you'll never die from your character floating into some projectile that you mean to avoid after you stop moving. There was only one instance where I felt like I was damaged by nothing at all and this wasn't until the very end of the game, and although admitedly I was very angry, I told myself ""It's Cuphead"" and moved on to finish the game.Boss variety is where the creativity of the development team really shines. Not a single boss mechanic is redone or rehashed in some way and every single boss is a unique fight. And what's even more impressive is that the entire game is made up of just boss fights and the game never ever gets old. There are a few run and gun levels but these just seem to be added as a way for the player to obtain currency to buy powerups from the shop, which is fine.Final Verdict:Cuphead is a masterpiece in every regard. With exceptional game design, graphical fidelity, and audio quality, Cuphead will be able to remain as immortal as the cartoons it's inspired by, making it the first of its kind. This game is an absolute must have for anyone and everyone with access to a console or PC."

,Recommended,268910,35316913,Posted: 29 September,all,Doctor Fudge,"This is really charming and cool, but it's got a lot of problems from my perspective.The Good:Controls are tight, very reminiscent of Contra. Jumping and dashing feel perfect, and actions seem instantaneous. The timing on the Slap take some getting used to, but once you do it feels second nature.The artwork is, no surprise, amazing. Absolutely nothing looks like a sprite, which is really impressive. It all looks just like cels painted onto backdrops, which are themselves amazing.The music isflawless. I was comparing it to Bendy's soundtrack, with Bendy coming across as being worse. The instrumentation is perfect, the mixing is perfect, nothing is wrong with any part of the sound design.To round it all off, this game is excellent for couch co-op. My friend and I were having a lovely time despite the following frustrations...The Bad:The screen rapidly fills with far, far too much stuff. The game is at its best when there's just enough going on on-screen to feel exciting, and at its worst when it just throws stuff in your face causing sensory overload. Way too many things cause an explosion, and the explosion is too big and distracting. I'd appreciate it if it could be redesigned with less smoke, or with some transparency to make it less obstructive. My friend and I felt overwhelmed and overstimulated in the run and gun sections, although that's mostly due to the fact that...Enemies spawn randomly. Mostly. It seems like there's a few enemies that are placed strategically, but there's also a seemingly endless barrage of enemies that keep spawning. It made building up a flow fairly difficult for us.I'm sure we'll get called casual babies for it, but there really needs to be some way to replenish health. We toyed with the idea that successful parry slaps could give you some health back if timed correctly. If more strategic enemy placement were employed, this wouldn't feel as necessary, but as it is we can't help but feel that dice-roll has the potential to screw you should an enemy spawn in in just such a way that you can't do anything about it.Our biggest gripe was thatBOSSES HAVE NO HEALTH BARS. We considered this unforgivable. It made the boss fights way, way too stressful, with no sense that we were progressing through it at a decent pace. We had no idea how far into any one boss fight we'd gotten, and the game certainly wasn't going to tell us. Very, very aggravating.The Conclusion:All in all, Cuphead is a very good game, and was clearly made with a lot of passion. The difficulty can be a little daunting, but not truly beyond the abilities of anyone with sufficient grit and gumption. I hope I'm not the only one with the issues that I have (My friend and I were certainly on the same page), and I hope that some patches come along to at least give us some health bars.The Score:8/10"

E.G: Learning to parry during a bossfight is useful but not necessary (if you feel like it's too difficult to try at the time)- Allows for flexible playstyles with meaningful abilities to equip.- Innovative (hand drawn!) and great looking graphics- Great music that matches the hectic pace of the game and ties it all togetherCons:- Hitboxes when shooting upwards are a bit wonky; seem ""thin""- Foreground scenery can sometimes obstruct the player's view"

However, it's a bit different than I thought it would be -- the game is level based, the overworld or mapscreen is like a non-linear, 3D version of Super Mario World. The actual levels seems to comprise of something like 4-5 just straight-up boss battles with maybe a level here and there that are primarly designed platforming or SHMUP levels.Actual combat feels something like a mix of Megaman X and Contra."

Its certainly challenging to beat the bosses & if you like doing encounters over and over to figure out boss patterns then you'll like this. I'm a pretty big Dark Souls fan and like bashing my head against the bosses in those games, so thought I'd be into this too; I think personally I need the lore and grand world building to keep me hooked into wanting to kill tough bosses!My only main criticism of the gameplay is that the parry mechanic felt a bit inconsistent as to whether it triggered or not - in the 45 mins I played I couldn't consistently pull it off. Maybe I'm a noob.I'd recommend trying this game even if I don't like it myself  as it is obviously a good game with amazing amazing art style - but it tilted me pretty hard!"

76561198027175022,Recommended,268910,35454304,Posted: 3 October,all,TehPryceIsRight,"TL;DR: Cuphead is a great game with amazing visuals and a stellar soundtrack. However, in order to best some bosses, the game will require near perfection. This can be really frustrating, but the game never seems unfair. I would give it about an 8/10 taking into account price, visuals, soundtrack, length of game, and amount of ""fun"".Pros:-Nobody will disagree with the fact that the old cartoon style visuals and music are fantastic-The boss designs are unique with each requiring a different strategy to defeat-The game is hard, but never seems unfair-Boss fights are not very lengthy (once you understand their patterns) so it is easy to pick up and play in your free time-Beating a boss feels incredible and gives you an incredible feelings of accomplishment-Replayability is unique because understanding a bosses phases from the start changes the fightCons:-The Run & Gun levels don't feel as good as the boss levels-Game is rather short, unless you feel like trying to S rank all of the bosses-There are multiple weapons, charms, and supers, but I always found myself using a combo of 3 weapons, 2 charms, and one super-The plane levels are nice, but I feel there could have been more levels or choosing of powers like normal levels-That Dragon boss (probably the most annoying one in the game)Review:Cuphead is a very good game. Amazing to look at and listen too and interesting to play. The game is very difficult and most bosses will not be bestest on the first try. Or even the tenth try. Cuphead is all about understading boss patterns. Once you have died enough to understand how the boss acts and when they do what move you can choose a weapon kit, charm, and super in order to turn the tide and gain the advantage. Once you ""download"" a boss and are able to beat them, the rush and feeling of accomplishment is fantastic. That is why people are comparing this game to Dark Souls. The feeling of beating a tough-as-nails boss that killed you tens (or hundreds) of times is where the enjoyment of this type of game comes from. So if you like the masochistic feeling of getting beat up for 10-30 minutes and then finally doing some beating up of your own you will enjoy this game.I did have some things I didn't like however. The Run & Gun levels are nice. In fact, I wish the game was based more around the run and gun levels and each level would end in a boss fight. However, these experiences are completely seperate. There are maybe 6 R&G level compared to the 18 boss fights. At that point they serve as an interesting distraction, but don't feel quite fleshed out. They do serve as an ability to get coins so you can buy weapons and charms, but I found that only 3 weapons and 3 charms were ever useful.The game is also rather short. As someone who played solo and no co-op (so far), it took me about 7 hours. The replayability comes from trying to get better ranks as the boss fights. Playing them again feels good because you understand how the fight is going to work, but constantly banging your head against a wall trying to get that perfect S rank isn't my style though I won't begrudge those that like to. Going back and trying everything in co-op might prove more fun.Overall, Cuphead was a good game and I feel like it was well worth $20. The going certaintly does get rough and some bosses feel invincible when you first start fighting them (GODDAMN THAT DRAGON BOSS), but overcoming the challenge feels great and keeps you coming back for more."

No boss is to alike or exactly the same, and always opposes a threat in ways you may not be entirely aware of.The case of which controls should you use to make it easier, in my case, doesn't matter. I still have an equal difficulty on both default settings of the keyboard and controller. It's either, would you like your hands to cramp, or to freeze.If you feel like this game is a bit pricey, think of it as getting games back then, short and fun and usually only single player use. In my opinion, really worth it!"

Even with that being the rule (and economically ""right"", since that's where the money is flowing) there are some devs that try to challeng this idea.And this is exactly where Cuphead fits.Visually speaking, the game is a gem. I play videogames for 25 years now and I had never felt before like I was indeed playing a cartoon. And that's what the game delivers.The audio part is as very competent as well, since the songs and audio effects used in the game succesfully recreates the ones present in the 30's cartoons.The gameplay. Well, if the rest of the game is gravitates around's a 9 or 9.5 rating, here is what Cuphead sets itself apart. The cartoony visuals may fool you to think that this is a kiddie game, but that is definitely not the case. At the start of the development, the goal was to made a ""boss-rush"" game, but after hearing some complaints, MDHR decided to add some regular stages (called Run and Gun here). And the balance they achieve is perfect, since you have a lot of bosses (so far I've seen 15 and I'm not even in the final world yet) and some platforming stages to let you breath a little. And everything challenges you here. The bosses are hard, with multiple phases and lots of different attacks that will always leave you on your toes. And the Run and Gun stages are one of the most devilish things I've played, reminding me of the great stages of Ninja Gaiden on NES.In a year where we've had lots of critically acclaimed games (Breath of The Wild, Horizon, Persona 5, Nioh, soon to be released Super Mario Odyssey), for me, it is Cuphead that deserves to be called Game Of The Year. It delivered everything it promised, and, better yet, even surpassed my expectations, and is one of those games that come every once in a while and makes me believe that there is still hope that we won't have to live forever with cinematic experiences and ""press X to win"" kind of gameplay.If you like to be challenged, if you like great visuals and you don't mind dying, since this is part of learning the mechanics of a videogame since its creation, buy Cuphead right now.Or, better yet: If you like REAL games, buy Cuphead right now."

Not only is it incredibly fun, but its animations and setpieces are breathtaking, and along with the fantastic studio-recorded music, the amazing character and boss designs, and the commitment to authentically reproducing a 1940's era cartoon... this game is possibly the APEX of artistry in game design. Make no mistake about it, this is more than just a gimmicky experience, it is a true diamond among games, a real GAMER'S game.Make no mistake, this game isn't merely difficult for wannabe journalists. It is actually quite hard and will test even seasoned gamers, accurately replicating the difficulty of old NES games like Contra, Battletoads and Megaman 1. if you're not ready for its difficulty, this game will chew you up and spit you out. But you will keep coming back, you will keep wanting to try again, keep wanting to shake your hips to the music, keep wondering what surprises the boss battles will pull out next.

Yes very. It's a hard game but it's not going to completely kick your♥♥♥♥♥ The difficulty is managed so well in this game its unbelievable, I never have a death in this game where I think ""hey that wasn't my fault"" the design is astonishing. When you get hit or die its because you messed up, it's never the games fault when it comes to this. Everything is designed so beautifully and I think it's true difficulty and its fair.The art style is the hook that this game has, there's not much to say about it thats not self explanatory by the game description or if you just take a quick look at it, it's a replication of old 1930's cartoons and it does it really well, I feel like I could see these characters and such back in one of those cartoons.As for gameplay, yeah it's good. Like I said with the difficulty everything is well balanced, nothing is broken. I came across one glitch in these game but a restart fixes it and thankfully each level has great replay value and doesn't forever anyway. As I was saying, even though the gameplay is good it's nothing special. This game brings in nothing unique to the gameplay scene when it comes to how you're playing it, however thats just fine. It's not like we asked for anything else and its not like they were trying to do that. The hook of this game is the art style and it was a huge focus for this game, as much as I hate to admit it this game is more about the art style than the gameplay (which is can't emphasize enough is still good, I'm not bashing it.)The soundtrack is amazing, you can hear distortion in some of the dialogue and music kind of just how you would if you looked back at some 1930's cartoon, this game really pulls it off. Along with the film grain, they did great. I've seen games try to replicate film grain and it's usually just so horrible and distracting and just obscures so much. While with this it looks realistic and it doesn't annoy the hell out of you.I absolutely recommend this game.EDIT: Forgot to touch on the story and characters of this game.I'm not going to put down a paragraph on what it's about because thats pointless and you can just play the game for yourself, but in my opinion cuphead and mugman are the most creative characters i've seen in a while. The story of this game is kind of generic I won't lie, so far (I haven't beaten the game) the story is good but it's not an outstanding piece of art. Though something like a deal with the devil and you having to repay your debt isnt the most creative thing, it's still a great idea and I think it fits the game well. Still unique and I love it."

Judging by all the material coming out for it, I could only hope that it was as good as everything was making it look to be. And I have to say, after my first several hours with the game, it has lived up to everything I had hoped for it and more. The attention to detail with the visuals, the beautiful and boisterous soundtrack, the fluid, responsive controls, all combine into the incredible game that Cuphead is. And then comes in the difficulty. I personally enjoy a good challenge in a video game and Cuphead provides that in spades. It finds itself in the perfect position of being tough enough to force you to throw yourself against the metaphorical wall quite a few times but is certainly in no way unfair. The punishment for failure is also nothing too, well, punishing, just throwing you back to the beginning of either the level or boss fight, depending on what you're attempting. And the endpiece showing you how far you made it into the level and how many stages were left is definitely a plus. The different upgrades you can purchase also sit on the nice balance of providing you both some sort of advantage and disadvantage so that you can either feel comfortable just running exactly with what you start with in-game or choosing what upgrades might suit your playstyle better.Overall, the game is incredible. I can highly recommend it and would definitely recommend bundling in the soundtrack because it is straight up fantastic. Everyone who can should pick up this game because it really is worth the wait and money."

,Recommended,268910,35359921,Posted: 30 September,all,Alex Ovenchicken,"Cuphead is nothing particularly new or refreshing in terms of game mechanics. We've seen Shooting, Jumping, Dashing, and Parrying in various 90's and early 2000's shooter/platformers. I don't feel like I will need to explain many of those mechanics as they have been done previously. However, it does deliver a solid shooting and platforming experience which oozes with unparalleled visual character, the best audio I've ever heard in a video game, and very fine polish when it comes to game mechanics we've seen done before.The first thing that stands out is the 1935 styled animated characters and scenery. This is styled well without compromising gameplay quality. The character design for the main characters Cuphead and Mugman are extremely well done and the animations are fluid and responsive to the input that you put in. The technical presentation and gameplay for me ran at a smooth consistent framerate. The animations match the inputs perfectly, and when you successfully move/jump/shoot your way to victory, you look supremely styled in 1930s nostalgic animation while doing it. The backgrounds are beautifully painted and contrast the ""cel-animated"" overlay elements on the map and game backgrounds. The fonts, screens and menus are all styled appropriately for the era it portrays. The technical process of putting together the animations as hand drawn cels really shows the care and attention of detail that went into the styling of the game. On the surface, it is this unique styling alone that will draw many to the game.The gameplay, if not innovative, is tight and responsive. I feel like my deaths are caused by my lack of response to the situation at hand, not because of cheap hit boxes or ""no miss"" hit mechanics. You really have to read the animations and the pattern choreography to succeed. When you get a perfect round on any of the levels or bosses, you feel a sense of accomplishment through successful gameplay. I never felt like I had to luck out to succeed. That being said, it takes time and a quick hand and response to get used to each level and boss. Be prepared to replay sections over and over, even to only get a C- rating. Unless you are used to these types of relentless shooter/platforming games it will take practice to succeed. If you are not used to repetitive sessions of gameplay like this; it could be a negative for some; however, this can be mitigated with certain weapon types and items that you can purchase at the shop cart on the game map.The audio is fantastic with live band recorded jazz and swing music; which really adds to the atmosphere and styling of the game. The sound effects which have artifacting and lo-fi filtering portray the era well. The sound recordings for effects and shots are well done, fitting to the visual style, and plenty of unique sounds for each boss and level. Each shot, each special, each enemy attack, each character voice, and even little sound queues for meeting map/boss requirements are able to be used simultaneously without sounding annoying or overbearing. The audio engineering here is executed wonderfully. The variety is top notch and without ludicrous reuse; with very unique sounds being used for different bosses and levels and attacks. The audio is so good it may make you think you're playing a AAA game.Value is top notch, being 1/3 the value of a common AAA game, and you should expect between 6-8 hours of gameplay for most casual gamers. A very fun couch co-op experience, with really great polish for under $25.We will have to see what the developer adds, but I think online co-op, score attack/time attack leader boards and perhaps even more levels/bosses and content would be great to add. I hope the successful launch of Cuphead will embolden the developer to make Cuphead 'truly runneth over.'"

Unlike those OLDER games, this game has tight and responsive controls. Anytime you die its usually your fault and not bad game mechanics.This game DOES the 1930's style of cartoons in the same vain as Betty Boop, Donald Duck, PinCushion Man and many others of that era. All the visuals are very accurate to the time period they are based on. From their muted colors, to the color bleed and film grain makes this feel as if its a old cartoon from the '30s. I cant get enough of it.Id advise a controller for this one. it works properly 100% with a Xbox 360 controller and a ps3 controller (or PS2 if you have an adapter like I have) and the prompts will correspond with the controller you chose (Xbox, Playstation or KeyBoard)Ive tried many controllers and even a USB SNES one isnt up to snuff for it (despite it having enough buttons, it just doesnt work... (so its not like UnderTale in that Regard)If the Single Player experience is too hard for you, Try the Local Co-Op. Its fun to play with a friend, and you can revieve eachother.  However enemy health scales; so like borderlands, the difficulty scales up a little bit. So expect BattleToads like frustrations! Your team mate can be revived but if he misses the chance, he can return by pressing start. However, this WILL take 1 HP from the other character!! Be careful!The only thing I could complain about is how the game defaulted at launch to 1280 x 720 (or a resulution similar). its not a problem really as it can be changed perminantly to your resolution of choice. This game does NOT support DSR, but it doesnt need it. If you have a 1440p monitor or a 4K monitor, the game WILL work in those resolutions! Additionally you can set the OverScan if it doenst display properly or if you want a small or HUGE black boarder around the screen. You can set the level of the Color Bleed, and in a fast paced game i prefer something like this to be off, and luckily that CAN be done by sliding it all the way to the left. However i wish you could turn off the film grain, but then again thats not a game ruiner for me and you tend not to notice it after playing for a bit. It has VSync on by default, but the frame rate on my computer is smooth even with it on. you can remap the controls if you feel the need to do so (which u might for the shooting or jumping)Above all i feel this is going to be a classic for years and years that people are going to be playing for a long time!i give this a 9.5/10 if i could due to its refreshing art style, tight controls and great gameplay. plus its $19.99 at launch! why wouldnt you want this! ITS CHEAP! ITS GOOD!"

Not a big deal, just a personal narm.Controller settings are odd, remapping buttons doesn't seem to work (at least to the triggers), but the original control scheme on controller is real nice once you get used to it. In general I recommend an Xbox controller.Have to restart the game after the credits scenes, the controller inputs are dead after them.Have to start the game by pressing what controller you want to use at the title screen, and you can't switch mid game, small deal considering this game takes no time to throw you back to where you were.No world jumping, worlds aren't too huge though, it's just extra seconds you're spending moseying around.The game is rather short, but♥♥♥♥♥♥it's 20$ and it's fun as heck, take what you will.Cons: HUR DUR NO ONLINE.No but really.I just spent 2 hours of my life trying just to perfect the Zeppelin on Expert.I'm pretty sure my eyes want to commit suicide.Cuphead ♥♥♥♥ed my wife, Mugman held me down, and Elder kettle watched from the doorway.This game ruined my life.Buy it."

Its music is fantastic, its controls are tight, the artistry is a callback that's as gorgeous as it is reverential. Everything is crafted with care. The odd transformative enemies with the not-quite-solid-enough-to-support-a-body bone structure that the old cartoon characters used to have are all present. It's a fantastic treat.Enough gushing, brass tacks:If you like platformers, if you like side scrolling shooters, if you like 1930's motif, you'll like this game on that alone, I think $20. That said, this game is difficult as all hell. It is brutally unforgiving, but rewards good play and knowledge (which often comes at the price of dying). Co-op scales this up a lot, so if you're playing with a friend, prepare to suffer. (It is still very fun, just understand going in that it is NOT the same game as single player, but I don't think in a bad way. However, you will die). It's not all doom and gloom as far as difficulty goes, there is a 'simple' mode on each level, so you can more casually enjoy the style.This game's individual levels are predominantly 'boss rushes', in that each level is mainly comprised of a unique boss that you have to defeat, the only traditional side scroller levels are titled aptly ""run and guns"" are used to gather money for various upgrades. Combat is straightforward, though nuanced given the aforementioned 'upgrades' you can buy, i.e. new weapons or accessories that alter how you fight. The parry system, which consists of being midair, then 'slapping' the particular target, does offer an interesting option for players, since parrying in a lot of situations is an optional choice that offers decent reward for some risk.All in all. It's hard, it's delightfully fun. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you want to challenge yourself at a price that I consider a steal, I think that this might be right up your alley."

This game is not meant to be played casually. If you're not somewhat versed with platformers, metroidvania, or I suppose even bullet hell type games, this game will be a pain to get through.Do I recommend it? Certainly. The gameplay is something that I consider to be like a combination of Megaman and Donkey Kong Country, but a bit more challenging. Like Megaman bosses, they're not hard once you've figured out their patterns and options and even exploit their flaws. While there are no weaknesses, there are power ups that make each boss fight easier given the situation and the moment you finally beat them leaves such a phenomenal feeling of accomplishment.The art and music is fantastic, as they present the asthetics of old fashioned cartoons and their bizzare representations of just about everything. Even if the game seems hard, at least you can enjoy the setting.Just note that this game requires a lot of coordination and awareness.This includes in the world mapas there are a lot of secrets around each world in unexpected nooks and crannies.I give this an 8/10, mainly due to the difficulty and a couple of bugs I found."

,Recommended,268910,35365231,Posted: 30 September,all,Gibus the White,"Cuphead has been a game I've been fascinated with since my first time seeing it in 2015. Just a small snipet within a Microsoft games montage was enough to peak my fascination as its style was reminiscent of the old Tom & Jerry cartoons I watched as a kid and frankly allowed it to stand out in the crowd. Since then I've kept up with the game keeping it in the back of my head until the release date had been revealed, to which I pre-ordered it for the $20 its worth. So is it worth that much?Short answer:Yes, though if you'd rather look at the art over playing an unforgiving boss-rush game I'd point you towards lets plays over purchasing this game.As for those wanting the full review, here you go:To start off with easily the biggest selling point we have the art style. This is 60fps animation of rubberhose-era 1930s cartoons on top of watercolor backgrounds. Now don't get me wrong, many a game has tried making 1900s era characters within a rubberhose style (an example being Peacock from Skullgirls). But few have gone the extra mile that makes this game's style truely a masterpiece to the era with some quality of life things that they could've easily avoided. Instead of going for the sharp HD look it goes for a more bled coloration to give an SD look. It also has a film grain over it to give the simulation of film imperfections while you play. These may sound bad but it contributes to the idea of it being an early 1900s cartoon. Bosses are animated in 60 fps instead of the 24 they could've easily gotten away with. This makes quite a number of bosses visual treats to the eyes with the final boss of the game being the best example I can give to the overall quality this animation gets.The main thing the style contributes to is the bosses. For one the limitless nature of 1930s cartoons gave many different possibilities to potential bosses and it really shows in this game. From living vegetables to humanoid frogs to balloon clowns to the devil himself, each boss feels unique to approach and watch. They also contribute the 1930s style of transformations into their bosses during phase changes to turn what was a simple fight to one careening into epicness. Almost every boss I've faced has gone through a transition from simple little bout to ""fate of the world"" levels of scale over the course of the fight.You'd think that this kind of boss-rush style of game would be cheap or even... ""unfair"", but the animation and sound design lend hand in hand to keep this from being the case. Each attack and action has a tell animation. If the animation is difficult to make out, they usually give a loud noise to bring attention to it. Never once have I died to an attack or boss (outside of bugs) did I ever find my death unfair or cheap. Heck most of my deaths are usually due to attacks I couldn't predict the first time I faced it or simple user error. It seems people find this kind of difficult game too much, but I say it's like live, die, repeat where you live through the fight, die to something, then live once more with the knowledge of what killed you and an idea on how to approach it next time. So yeah, don't expect to beat the bosses on your first... I don't know 10 times? There's no way you'll be able to beat the boss using your limited knowledge in a short time span save for some of the early ones.Now this is a boss rush style of game so the bosses make up around 75% of every stage you can go to, but the remaining 25% is platformers. Now you aren't forced to play the platforming stages to progress through the game, but doing so will allow you to acquire coins that you can use to buy charms and shot types for your character which can help you in later boss fights. There are a set number of coins in each platforming stage so you can't go back to a stage to ""farm"" coins. Do note however that while you can buy everything in the shop with the number of coins you can possibly get in the game, you cannot get all of the coins simply by doing the platforming stages...So we have a great looking game that's difficult yet fair... any downsides?Well I have two:For one the developers have left co-op to local play. While this doesn't make or break the game, it is odd (at least for PC) that multiplayer is limited to local. This will be removed if they add online co-op in the future.Another thing is that the game isn't perfect. I've ran into a few bugs in some of the fights that make it more difficult to face the boss. Instances of ""phantom damage"" facing the devil, pink pill stacks with the bird and the rare instance of a boss invulnerability bug I found within the aforementioned bird boss. Again these aren't deal breakers, but they are the only things I've seen from the bosses that can be remotely considered ""unfair"".Aside from that this is an amazing game with great visuals, challenging gameplay, and all the love and care in the world.Buy it if you're interested enough in the artstyle and or gameplay, but if you can't take the heat of this hard game then I'm afraid Cuphead isn't the game for you."

The art style is probably my favorite part of the game. The gameplay is very smooth, and you feel in control of your character the entire game. Each boss is unique and has fun transitions throughout each of their phases. It takes a while to learn how to defeat each boss, and it feels rewarding each time you make it to a new phase. The run and gun stages were few in number, and I enjoyed them alright, but I definitely preferred the bosses. At first, this game seems like it is going to be very short, but the difficulty increases very quickly, and suddenly you realize you are in for a treat. I recommend this game to people who are willing to dedicate time to the same trial over and over until you succeed. If you get frustrated easily, you may not like this game."

If you've been a fan of platformers/run and gun games such as this, then this game could be a cake walk to you. For those who haven't touched a platformer/run and gun game, it will seem harder to you.Replay value is pretty high even if you have completed everything is in the game.Games like Cuphead and Bendy need support. We need more games like these that feel more like there's passion behind it rather than a sales gimmick.This game could have easily been ""it looks like 1930s cartoons"" and that's it."

The Run & Gun parts are also very well done. If you are looking for an amazing art style, look no further than the 1930's Disney animation style. You won't get any closer to the old animation style than this. The soundtrack is also impecable with its funky jazz and the awesome quartet on the title screen.Art: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10Challenge: 10/10Overall: 10/10BUY THIS GAME IT'S GREAT"

I have never been more enamored by such a simple yet effective art style.I absolutely recommend this game, sale or no sale.

76561198041753179,Recommended,268910,35483255,Posted: 4 October,all,dado.cangemi,"Cuphead is going to change the game industry, just like Dark Souls did some time ago, even if for different reasons.Music is great (buy the soundtrack if you can), levels have challenging designs, bosses have interesting patterns, gameplay is overall good and visually is great.Unfortunately I have some issues with it. Note that I played only solo.FIrst off, there's some minor bugs, as when I return to the press start screen the second time after playing, and no input on controller or keybooard works. Or the (in)famous devil hitbox bug, you know which one I'm talking about.Some enemy projectiles teleporting randomly and the 3rd stage of the spooky train boss not moving to the last one (the locomotive)Aside from this, the game has some flaws I think:- the parry is very fun, but often it's not rewarding because your character will not be invincible right after it, exposing you to enemies and projectiles. Also, you can't parry without jumping and this is very inconvenient. For example, try to parry in the Queen Bee level and then tell me what you think.- enemy patterns are random, you can expect everything from the bosses, and this is good, aside from the fact that the level of randomness reaches a point in which you will be hit by force (if yu played the devil, you know what I'm talking about)- I think the 3 way is the best weapon in most situations. It's not like the others are not useful, it's that the 3 way is too useful to not bring it in battle. Maybe other weapons would need a buff.- If you want to make the game easier, just equip the smoke bomb and nothing else. It's the most useful item, and you'll be using it for 90% of the game.- The first super move is very risky to use, because if an enemy steps on you immediately after you've used it, you'll take damage. The third one is just too impractical to use. Guess what? You'll be using the second one for most of the time. Yeah, it's like there are items in this game that you'll use more than others. It's a wasted opportunity I think.- the game is not that hard, you can beat it if you insist, but at least you have to be an average skilled player wanting to give it all. The gripe is that if you want something more, like playing for S in each level, you'll suffer from frustration because of how much perfect you have to be. You have to beat the expected time to finish the level, do at least 3 parries (and we talked about how a parry could put you in danger constantly), never take damage, use 6 cards of special moves and I still haven't figured out what is skill level. So, frustrating because maybe you were perfect but, silly you, you haven't used you special power, so no S ranking for you -.-In conclusion, I wanted this game so badly that I spent 20 euros that I shouldn't spend. I needed those money, but I got at a point I was constantly watching gameplays, so after a while I gave in and bought Cuphead, and I'm very happy to have bought it. Recommended, buy right now or wait for 25%.P.S.  I'm now trying expert mode, and it's challenging. I like how they didn't simply changed some game parameter, instead they changed the boss pattern in a challenging way. Still I don't suggest anyone to do it with the intention of getting an S in it. Just focus on beating it the first time."

76561198163975918,Recommended,268910,35498085,Posted: 5 October,all,FS AkwardZebra,"Cuphead is a breath of fresh air ironically for something that is baised on the 1930's. I personally loved every moment the game had to offer and was constanly blown away by the level of quality throughout the entire game. The art in this game is beautiful; every character is unique and has personality to match. The little details are what make this game great, like watching the frames when a boss transforms into its next menacing stage. I used to watch old cartoons from what this game is baised on with my dad, and the about of love and respect that was put in shines through.  I was so giddy with joy as a watched a flying waffle explode on my screen or a mermaid turn into medusa and turn me to stone. Also I could just watch Cuphead bounce up and down all day. The gameplay is simply brilliant to say the least. The controls are tight and I never expirienced any form of input lag or frame drops. The closest thing I can relate Cuphead to is classic megaman, exept of running a stage and facing a boss, you face ridiculous over the top bosses on thier own and do the running bit as a another stage. This game is not easy, which is super refreshing in a market where I feel thats games have been boiled down to simple waste on time. With Cuphead whenever I beat a boss or passed a stage I felt a great sense of accomplishment that I haven't had from a game in a long time. Half the fun of the game is getting frustrated with a boss, and harnessing your skills to learn the patterns and timings to succeed. All of the games mechanics were used to thier full, for instance there is a flying mechanic that was introduced early on that was consistantly used throughout. There are also a great number of costumizations that you can make to Cuphead like secondary fires, special moves, and abilities that I felt enhanced the game and let me play with my own style. Overall, Cuphead is a genius game that is well worth the small price of $20. Thank you MDHR for doing what you did with this game, it was well worth the wait and I look forward to future projects."

,Recommended,268910,35421191,Posted: 2 October,all,LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DOOOOO,"As a fan of golden era animation in all of its surreal, (and generally unfortunate) politically incorrect glory, discoveringCupheadwas a bit of a revelation; the game I never knew I wanted.And it's a masterpiece, or damn close to being one.Aesthetically,Cupheadis on point, the culminating artistry of pie-eyed cel animation, watercolor backdrops, technicolor saturation, natural film filter and swinging jazz soundtrack an honest work of love. Bad puns and surrealist slapstick seal the deal.Controls... perfect. Cuphead -- our titular protagonist -- is weighted just right, every button press instant; effortless, something countless modern platformers fail to ever get right. That said, parrying certain objects or enemies can be unusually frustrating in comparison (i.e. the rolling ladybugs on ""Treetop Trouble"").Cupheadis boss-centric at its core. While some games fail to provide enough variety in that format, this one does not; from visual design to shuffling phases, every boss fight feels fresh, and platforming stages scattered between further prevent any potential burnout. The same cannot be said for the horizontal shoot 'em stages; their rarity leaves them feeling out place, and the plane itself is honestly too sluggish for the amount of projectile avoidance required. Doable? Yes, but I dread them every time, pretty like the rest of the game as they may be.Despite this, the challenge level throughout is wonderfully consistent; a hard game, but for the right reasons. Every stage pushes you to a new degree of twitch skill multitasking, but never do they feel impossible, even past the halfway mark where I currently sit.There's a scoring system present, but as with most games that try to rate player performance over a simple, number-based tally, it's incredibly arbitrary; a stage I feel I did well on nets me a C, but one where I made an♥♥♥♥♥of myself? B+ or higher. Frankly with a game likeCuphead, the only accomplishment that matters to me is making it to the end while having fun along the way.Local co-op only is also a letdown, especially in 2017. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have their friends close by. This includes myself.But when your game is near-exemplary, a few missteps hardly detract from the overall picture, and that's whereCupheadstands: a work of interactive art worthy of praise despite imperfection."

The entire thing feels like a forgotten cartoon that was discovered, brought to the future, and made playable via warping reality itself. I could easily see Cuphead himself getting his own cartoon shorts if he were made back in the day.A good amount of the bosses are hard, yes. But they are beatable. They may appear invincible, but that is a facade. Treat them not as a reason for frustration, but as a learning experience. Adapt and overcome, and you will succeed.

,Recommended,268910,35459141,Posted: 3 October,all,xXToYeDXx,"BUYER BEWARE!I am fully recommending this game but beware... it is frustratingly difficult. If you plan on playing this with a controller like the Xbox One of Xbox 360 controller do yourself a large favour and remap both the Dash and Secondary/Super buttons. I can't tell you how many times I Dashed into a boss or enemy simply because I gently rubbed the Y button while reaching for the B button.Although this game is a gem it isn't without it's issues.First of which is the obvious artificial difficulty. Graphics in the foreground frequently hide enemies and obscure you from seeing animation patterns. This will cause you to get hit by attacks that would otherwise be easily anticipated had the animations not been hidden. Certains levels will have other issues such as the terrain being angled vertically while your main attack shoots straight.Secondly, the default controls are passable yet as already mentioned can cause problems in a fast paced game like this. Accidentally pressing the wrong button while reaching the right one can mean absolute failure. Remap the Dash button to be as far away from the other buttons as possible. I recommend a trigger or a bumper.Thirdly, there will be many times when there is just too many things happening to keep up. Frequently you will find yourself pinned and unable to avoid taking damage. Avoiding 1 thing will sometimes mean taking damage from 1 of 4 other things that have you pinned in a corner. This can be extremely frustrating given that certain bosses have a tight camera  and a small playable area to move Cuphead around.Now let me talk about all of the things I love about this game.This game is a nostalgia trip. As a child I had hundreds of old cartoons of this style on VHS. The genre damn near defined my entire childhood between the ages of 3 and 10. Cuphead makes me want to dust off the old VCR and dig out my old VHS tapes and just binge for hours. There is something to be said for any modern work of art that brings back such fond childhood memories precisely how they are remembered.The game is very skill intensive. You will die... a lot, until you have the patterns of enemies down pat and can play around them. There is a large focus on boss battles in this game. There are side scrolling run and gun levels however they are mostly there to collect coins needed for skill upgrades.Once you get the hang of it you will find Cuphead is an extremely challenging yet equally rewarding experience. If, like me, you grew up on old cartoons like Betty Boop and the works of Max Fleischer, your childhood is not only being respected by everything this game is, it is being celebrated and cherished."

Spending anywhere from half an hour to two hours on a boss and finally being able to beat it gives the player an amazing feeling. A feeling that can only be achieved through the hard work and dedication it takes to defeat most of these bosses. My only compaint is the Run and Gun levels. They felt kind of just added in to appease the people who are partial to platformers. They were still fun, but I would have preferred more boss battles or some other way to earn coins for the shop. Overall though, a fantastic game with a beautiful artstyle, soundtrack (I'd recommend purchasing the soundtrack if you like the type of music heard in trailers for the game, it's nearly 3 hours long too!) and game design. TOTALLY BUY IT."

,Recommended,268910,35442411,Posted: 3 October,all,Hooligan Spooks,"Not as hard as the games I grew up with.Not as easy as modern games with regenerating health and exessive hand holding.It does throw you right into the fray without much prepaeration. It reminds me of the first Zelda, kinda just like ""Here you go, now go die and figure things out"" And dieing is something that is going to happen alot. I never felt cheated in my deaths, they were all my fault or due to trying a new, unexplored tactic. Bosses have a anywhere from obvious to slight teligraphs, but nothing is cheap. Also, the fights will require you to memorize the enemys move/fight pattern. Each boss is a set of stages that evolve and change, as you get farther and farther and die more and more.Dosnt sound like fun, but it really is!My only real complant is that not all the weapons and power-ups (Charms, Arts) feel equally useful. The Smoke Screen is a MUST have, and while some weapons like the low powered, long range Chaser vs the high power, short range spread shot are well balanced and offer differnt tactics, I went through the whole game without finding a need for ones like The Charge shot, or the Lobbrer. The same goes for the Invincibility art, and the single Auto Parry Charm. Really all I used was Coffee and Smoke Screen.Besides that gripe, its a wonderful game that offers tight gameplay, beautiful style and music, with creative boss battles and art that is right out of 1930's. Im not gonna try to discribe the charm and charisma that the game is filled to the brim with.I would highly reccomend to anyone who can handle to bullet hell style gameplay without rage quiting and sending a controller/key board into the wall."

The instructions are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the whole situation most of the tips will go over a typical players head. There's also Cuphead's imprecise movements, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his wavering self draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the animations, to realise that they're not just cartoon-y - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who say they cleared the Cuphead tutorial in minutes truly ARE lying- of course they would have looked up, for instance, the solution to this obstacle ""Y DASH QUICK EVADE ON GROUND OR AIR,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to the control manual. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jared Moldenhauer's genius wit unfolds itself on their game screens.

The visuals are amazing,and the music is fantastic! I find my self humming to the soundtrack. The controls are pretty smooth too. Gameplay is a 2d platformer but cupheads bosses take the spotlight. You can tell how much work they put into the game. Now I will say that cuphead is hard, the game took me under 14 hours to beat, but I really enjoyed my experience it was a lot of fun. You need to prepare to experience a lot of trial and error.

For me the first two or so bosses I fought were not all that hard for me to beat, but after that well lets just say right now im stuck, but that is not a bad thing.  One of the great things about Cuphead is if you get sick to trying to beat that boss you can always just go to another one, unless its the only boss left on the island your on.  The game is a pice of art music is amazing cant go worng there.  The controls are simple, though I do recomend a controller for cuphead.  I have no as yet played the two player game of this so I cant comment on that. when you fight a boss and loss The game tells you how close you got to beating the boss and it makes you want to try again and again.  I cant think of any other game that has been so difficult yet I dont need to take time away from the game to recoup I just try and try again.. speaking of trying again I best go try and beat dragon..."

,Recommended,268910,35449388,Posted: 3 October,all,Axiiom,"(TL:DR at the bottom if you're looking for that) Cuphead is a masterwork of what gaming could and should be. It has a phenominal and wildly unique art style, excellent gameplay loop, very responsive controls, interesting story, great comedy, and all around exceptional experience. But of course, like everything, it has it's flaws, and they're very prominent.Pros- Excellent gameplay loop. Boss fights are fun and diverse- Excellent control response. The game handles like a dream- Excellent soundtrack. I don't buy many game soundtracks, but I bought this one- Excellent art style. I think you already know this- It's a hard game, and I love thatCons- No online multiplayer. We'll talk more about this in a bit- No scaling for 2 or 1 player fights. This is a balancing issue- It's a hard game, and I hate that""No online multiplayer""-This one is a huge issue. I don't know what StudioMDHR were thinking when they decided to do this, but it's an awful idea. Cuphead is a game that almost requires two players for most fights (unless you're very very very good at this game). I can not even begin to think of a possible reason why there would be no online coop. Hey devs, if you're reading this, FIX YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING GAME! Why would you make such a masterpiece and then ruin it by leaving out such a vital feature! What an awful decision!""No scaling for 1 or 2 players""-Another big issue that I don't really understand. Cuphead is actually an easier game with 2 people. This doesn't make any sense, scaling should be a part of every game that offers multiplayer, yet in Cuphead playing alone means playing at a massive disadvantage. The game is still a wallop to play by yourself, but it is a lot harder and some bosses might take you a solid few days to beat. I see no good reason not halve the health of all bosses or something if playing the stage alone. Needless to say this is one of the games stupidest mistakes.And one final word before closing out on the difficulty of Cuphead. Cuphead is ♥♥♥♥ing hard. If you're a casual gamer, or you just don't enjoy constantly failing, DO NOT buy this game. Cuphead will own you, thousands of times. We fought that damned clown boss maybe 100 times before we got him dead. This game is punishing, this game is unforgiving, this game is cruel. But the feeling of beating a boss makes it all worth it. Again, if you're a casual gamer, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.In conclusion, Cuphead is a masterpiece. If you like the art style and you like boss rush games then this is the perfect thing for you. It checks off almost every box on the perfect game list, making just a few pretty key mistakes that you can fortunately overlook in most cases. Cuphead is a game you should buy, at full price, no need to wait for a sale.(TL:DR - The game is a ♥♥♥♥ing work of art, you should absolutely buy it, it's phenominal. But, it has no online multiplayer, and the fights don't scale for 1 or 2 players, which means it's a LOT easier with a friend. That being said, even if you're playing alone, it's still definitely worth getting at full price.)"

,Recommended,268910,35433108,Posted: 2 October,all,Gemah ~ Suddenly Doggo,"Cuphead is easily my GOTY 2017. Such a charming game! I don't remember the last time i've played something with such passion and love. I'd recommend recommend this game if it was sold by a higher price because the devs do deserve it.For starters, this game may not please everyone due to two aspects:1930's aesthetics and music - Since it was made to simulate the look, feeling and aesthetics of 1930's cartoons, Cuphead has a very unique aesthetic that's pleasing to many older people, but maybe not so much younger ones. At the same time, the film noise effect and the color bleed may be annoying to some. Personally, as those cartoons were part of my childhood and given the effort to detail and quality animation that exists on them I couldn't help but to love it. Some people also reported blurred graphics but I think that playing on your's monitor native resolution may make the game sharp enough. The music is your usual mainstream genres from that same time, so in the end it's a matter of taste. I personally enjoy jazzy tunes with saxes and basses. My ears were pleased the whole time I played the game.The difficulty - Normally I roll my eyes when people say thatX game is the dark souls of Y type/genre of games. Because most of the time it's an exageration given how people grew less tolerant to difficult games over the years. But claiming that Cuphead is a Dark Souls of Run 'n Gun Platformers isn't a complete exageration since you'll die a lot and the game does require you togit gud.The story is simple. Cuphead and his brother Mugman who live happily in a cartoon land end up in a shady Casino and lose a bet to the Devil. In order to not lose their souls, they gotta run around and collect contracts of other unfortunate characters that are under the same fate, but in debt to the Devil. Not only it's a simple story fitting of older games, but it's also a plot that you could find in older cartoons such as Tom & jerry and Looney Tunes.If anything, cuphead pretty much plays like classic Run 'n Gun games such as Contra series and Gunstar Heroes. As a matter of fact there are many nods to these and other games in Cuphead itself. Cuphead not only borrows ideas from other Run 'n Gun games, but also borrow ideas and elements from other classic platformers and even games belonging to other genres (such as SHMUPs, fighting games and RPGs).Based on what's present on the game you can see the influences the developers brought into their games, and also the fact that they just didn't grabbed ideas and tossed in there. They played their source material, chosed those elements carefully, crafted and mastered it to the enviroment and universe surrounding the setting of Cuphead.Cuphead has a somewhat unique parrying mechanic that allows you to interact with pink objects and projectiles (often destroying them) while allowing a double jump. That's activated by pressing the jump button while in mid air as soon as you come in contact with such objects.The game, as discussed before, has a great artistic value, having backgrounds painted in watercolor and characters colored as if they were painted in animation cels. If anything, the only flaw of Cuphead is that at times the game's enviroment is so detailed there's just too much visual pollution on certain stages, specially SHMUP ones.The game is not a pure platforming game, it's a mix of platforming stages, boss stages and SHMUP stages, although the boss ones being the prevalent. The bosses all have patterns and skillsets that can be mastered, but in some instances the game relies heavily on RNG regarding certain bosses. One thing worth noting is that dying to a boss will set you on the beginning of the stage and while you can't see how much beating is remaining, at death you can check how close you were to beat it.Surprisingly for me it's hard to talk about Cuphead without praising it. It's not a perfect game, but if anything I can give it a 9.9/10 with ease. Just go and give the devs some love because Cuphead is the game I was expecting for years, but never expected to come in long while."

The aesthetic, overall, is just a joy.The difficulty (on Normal/Regular), I feel, was tuned to be just right. There wasn't a single boss that I managed to kill on the first try, but there also weren't any bosses that I failed to kill after repeated attempts at learning what to do.I do wish there was a little more to it, as it took me just under 8 hours to beat, and I'm not that interested in simply playing through it again on a harder difficulty or trying to get better scores, but I can see how that might appeal to others.Overall, easy to recommend at the base price, because it was a challenging yet solidly enjoyable 8 hours spent, and the option's always open to revisit it for multiplayer with someone else later."

Every scene is so well made in it's artwork and 1930's style that you want to stare at the beauty, however this game is without a doubt a difficult platform shooter.playing as either cuphead or mugman you will have to run jump and shoot avoiding any contant with enemies, and after only 3 hits you will die and have to start over. luckily most levels are relatively short (except toward the end) the boss battles are fair and after repeated playthroughs will be able to inticipate what the boss will do next. the run and gun levels are more or less annoying the only reason that you should probably play them is to get coins to get more powerful weapons and power ups for the boss battles. overall cuphead is a huge success mixing it's 1930's ethstetic and tight controls(you should probably change the controller layout)to make one of the best game's of 2017. should you buy the game you should also buy the ost which has great 1930's jazz soundtrack that make cuphead not only look like the old mickey mouse cartoons but sound like them to. studio MDHR did an incredible job being entirely hand drawn and made the wait absoluty worth it. I can't say it enuogh this is a must buy game, and I can't wait for what studio MDHR will do next."

The game consists 25% platforming, and 75% boss battles, all missions are well thought out, and unique in their own way, there is no one mission I have encountered in which I felt was a repeat of another.

,Recommended,268910,35432688,Posted: 2 October,all,Ber,"One of the most amazing games I have played. Cuphead manages to make a fairly difficult gameplay that consistantly feels fair throghout the entire game. The gameplay makes it a most get for fans of old clasics like Contra or MegaMan, and it also adds the parry mechanic which is really well executed and used in insane and creative ways in almost every boss battle and run and gun level. Even though the gameplay is similar and comparable to games like Contra or Metal Slug, this one takes insane creative liberties in the level design, and boss design. It's also very focused on the boss battles, but that doesnt mean that the small amount of run and gun levels aren't as great as them. The soundtrack is fantastic, and the visuals are obviosly some of the best out there. There are very few problems, and the ones that are the most noticible to be mentioned are that very few small enemies move really weird, like blinking. Sometimes Cuphead or Mugman might also be affected by this, but both are insanely rare, i only saw them twice.Get this game!"

The game is relatively short (6 hours if you really get the hang of all the bosses), but completely worth the entry price of 20 dollars. The sound, visuals, and feel of the game are all very tight and you almost feel as though you're playing a 1930's cartoon.That being said, the game is fairly hard, so don't let the visuals fool you."

Everyone moans about the difficulty but Personally i think its right in the sweet spot of not being too difficult or being too easy. the only thing that im having trouble with in this game is the parry. the parry does not work as neat as it could do and the battles with the plane are slow and awkward. but the other modes like run and gun or the boss battles are fun to play8/10all this kids leaving bad reviews cant get past the tutorial

76561197960912290,Not Recommended,268910,35532882,Posted: 6 October,all,Vividnightmare,"Yeah, just no. I know I'll be downvoted like crazy because of the fanatical success this game is getting right now. But it's insanely hard. Now, don't misunderstand that, I'm a Darksouls player, I love Hollow Knight and Dead Cells. I enjoy games that are difficult. But clue into this, there is a reason all the reviewers are saying ""It's hard but *fair*"". The reality is, because it isn't fair, not really. It create the illusion of fairness with simple mechanics, but it overwhelms average human reflexes with onslaughts and breaks its own rules constantly. In reality what looks like a challenge is merely a memorization game, not entirely unlike the early parts and boss battles of Darksouls. Except that every single level, every boss, is exactly that. You will die, over and over and over and over. The 'challenge' is merely to memorize the exact placement and patterns of every single enemy and event in precise order and then nail your timing and execution exactly. I guess that's considered a 'challenge' by many, but to me it's drab and boring. You never feel like you've 'figured' it out, the games going to beat you without mercy and eventually your skins going to thicken. Congrats. It has amazing visuals and the audio is perfect. The story is simple but charming as well. For people with inhuman reflexes I'm sure this is a blast, but overall the perfection it demands feels unrewarding. There is an upgrade system, it's decent for the game. The big flaw is that for a memorization game, it breaks its rules too often. An enemy will jump just a bit further randomly, change its direction out of its routine, etc. Things just randomly change from time to time, then after you restart it goes right back to the old pattern you had gotten used to. It's like the game is constantly trying to remind you who has the real power. This is the sort of game where if you make a single mistake, you can just immediately pause and restart the map, you can depend on the knowledge that the single damage you took early on has aboslutely screwed you from beating the level. If you are just looking for a challenging game, you should look else where. This isn't a challenge, its sadistic. If that is what you're looking for, this is a charming romp through beating a wall down with your head."

,Recommended,268910,35439112,Posted: 3 October,all,Julius Seizure,"""Are games art?"" They used to ask. The answer, in most cases, is no. Most games are churned out by the dozen, filled with high-resolution textures and big-name voice actors, and drum up a steady din of explosions and violence to fill the gaps where gameplay and story should be. A big, muddy mess with plenty of different names and lables, all designed to hide the fact that they're selling the same experience over and over, again and again.Games like Cuphead, however? Those are art. And I'm not just talking about the visuals, amazing as they are.Disregarding the visuals and music for now, Cuphead is a game that calls back to a time before the term ""triple-A"" ever got near the gaming circut. Its simple, solid mechanics serve as a framework for a series of about thirty different boss battles, each one a completely unique and challenging experience in their own ways. You're allowed to customise your character to an extent, changing their weapons and abilities to adapt to each boss's tactics and powers. And youwillneed to adapt; the game isn't designed as a rollercoaster experience, sending you on a quick and easy path to the end credits and Gift Shop DLC. You get three lives per attempt, one hit per life, and no way to recover during battle. Lose them all, and you get a mocking game-over screen and a one-way trip to your chosen destination of the start of the battle, the overworld map, or the title screen. And it won't be because of an undodgeable attack or an instant game-over move, it'll be because you made too many mistakes. And that's just fine, because you'll go right back to the start of the battle with a better idea of what to expect, thus having a better shot at avoiding those mistakes next time. Much as they might try to convince you otherwise, there's nothing a boss can throw at you that you can't deal with; you only need to figure out how.As for the music and visuals, well. There's not much to say that hasn't already been said, but just to reiterate: It's beautiful, true to the era, and entirely hand-made. The music was provided by an actual jazz band, the art is entirely hand-drawn down to each individual animation frame, and it all comes together as an experience that's truly unlike anything else on the market.Granted, it's not a perfect experience. Considering the utterly bizzare nature of most of the bosses, it can be really hard to predict what they'll do next. Certain attacks have incredibly vague tells, making it hard to figure out what the attack will be before it hits you. Some of them also have randomized elements to their battles, such as which minions they send out or what attacks happen in which pattern, and later in the game it can get really hard to keep track of everything on the screen. The visuals even work against the game at times, obscuring projectiles and hazards behind pieces of foreground art, although instances of this happening are thankfully rare.Cuphead offers two things that many other recent games don't: A respectable, reasonable challenge, and a style that the most expensive rendering engines on the market can't hope to replicate. For those two things, I can't possibly recommend it enough."

Wish they programmed more than 2 difficulty settings.

But it isn't hard in an unfair way. I've played many games where you feel like whether you win or lose is purely down to RNGesus, but this game has none of that. There is only one boss where RNG can cruelly mess you up, and it's not enough to make you fail the stage (but getting an S rank is a pain). Apart from that one boss, the rest can be mastered to the point where you'll always take 0 damage.Imagine a game where every battle felt like the last boss of a long and awesome campaign. That's what Cuphead is like. You always feel epic fighting the bosses, and you always feel epic beating them. It can be frustrating at times because it can take a lot of trial and error, as classic-style boss fights tend to. If that bothers you then you may wanna wait till this game is on sale or not buy it at all.However, DESPITE the frustration of failing, I honestly found that every time I did, I came back  a little better, got to the next phase of the boss, and finally defeated them without spending an obscene amount of time. Failure doesn't even feel so bad because you get to see a card with the boss mocking you with a witty quip (often rhyming). I have literally gone and died on phases I never died on before just to see these little lines.I'm not even gonna talk about the visuals because honestly, the trailer speaks for itself. They are INCREDIBLE. I love how everything seems to be dancing and the music and visuals are so well integrated. It's an amazing experience.As for downsides: one thing you may hear is that the game is short. That's actually not true. It's short if you're a bullet hell master and you breeze through half the stages, I'll grant you that, but for those people there is Expert mode. I'm working my way through it now, and what I like is how the difficulty isn't just increased in BS ways. There are interesting and subtle changes that change the way you approach each stage. Sometimes the patterns are vastly different.In short, it actually has great replayability. Furthermore, if you really did find yourself storming through everything including even the Expert stages, then there's a speedrun community that's already booming, so you can test yourself against other people who finished the game fast.TL:DR - Cuphead is a great game that has a crap-ton of replayability, an excellent aesthetic with good harmony between the visuals and music, and hard, but most importantly FAIR boss fights that are exciting and satisfying to learn and master. If you love platformers and particularly games like the Megaman series, then you'll love this. I loved it even more than I expected to, and that's why I've put in 17hrs already and will likely put in many, many more. It is 100% worth the price."

FOR A VIDEO GAME. im just blown away by how much work and love went into this game and im so glad its been such a success. everything from the smears to the wonky bouncy movements and visual gags of 30s cartoons to the music down to the plot to even just the way it was created--cel animation and watercolor backgrounds for a DIGITAL medium--i cant praise it enough, and i really admire everyone who worked on it. i can only imagine how many frames were involved. it really is art all around, and i dont say that lightly. i dont think ive ever been floored by a video game before, let alone one about mugs.the mechanics are tricky to get the hang of but once you find a setup you like, you pick it up fast enough, i think. my only big complaint is that theres no general 'easy mode' because my god this game is HARD. i like a challenge but oh gosh its especially difficult if you dont play run-and-gunners very often, or youre just looking for a relatively chill time. some of the stages have a 'simple' option but even thats still wicked hard.regardless i HIGHLY recommed this game, if only because they worked so darn hard and deserve to be recognized. im still pretty early into it, but i dont think ill be able to stop playing it through to the end."

There are abilities and shooting types that are vastly superior than others. The idea that the game has that certain abilities are situational seems like a very odd choice and in reality that is not really the case. If you're a casual gamer then I would recommend this game for you, but if you're a fan of games of this genre this game is a very weak attempt since it brings RNG into a skill game, which is always a very bad choice of design."

After every level instead of feeling satisfied in any way, it just feels like ""thank god I never have to do that again"". To be clear, I have no problem with the game being difficult. My problem is there isn't much payoff for said difficulty.My biggest problem with the gameplay itself is the parry mechanic. It feels more like a gimmick than part of your moveset, and usually is only used for the bosses' gimmicks. It can only be used on pink things (although there are some that you can't use it on), and it will usually just end up hurting you since it often bounces you up into something. As far as I can tell, the hitbox is significantly smaller than the animation so it really isn't reliable. The only reasons to use it are that it gives you some super charge and it factors into your score. I'd say that it should give you some invincibility frames so it actually feels worthwhile and doesn't just screw you over half the time.The game is always frustrating but usually fair enough, however there are some moments where it just feels cheap.  Like on the bee stage, you can get stuck above the screen and get hit by things you can't see. And the smoke bomb item is pretty much mandatory since you'll often be put in situations where you're surrounded. There are also some bugs: the ghost's eyes sometimes teleport, the crane monkey boss went offscreen and died once, the final boss has a bugged attack that makes you take damage for no reason, and I had the super meter stat break once.On a positive note, the music and art are phenomenal. Major props to them, they knocked it out of the park on that front. But if you just want to play it for this reason, get it on sale.In the end, I'd say this is a game for Hardcore Gamers™. So if you need something to brag about on the internet, play this game. Otherwise, I'd say skip it."

,Not Recommended,268910,35367738,Posted: 1 October,all,Jay,When I started out playing this game. I thought I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the classics. The art direction & music are top notch. The developers did a amazing job with water paint style from the 30's.  The reason this game makes me want to bash my head into the wall is in mid game it's a matter of pure luck if you get through the levels or mot. And out of no where you get a easy level that a child could do. I love hard games. I grew up playing games like Megman & Contra on trhe NES. And I loved all the Souls games. So I do like a challenge. But as is this game seems broken & UNBALANCED..  Just a ton of crap flying all over the screen nonstop. You'll die over & over just trying to dodge stuff flying around you. That's not even mentioning all the ton of enemies that keep coming from the left & right & even from the sky as your trying to get through the level. And beside the run & gun this game is basically a Boss fight simulator. Which they don't make clear on the trailer. You think your getting a 2D platformer. Not boss fight after boss fight. Very little Run & gun as they call it. I wish I could give this game a thumbs up. Who knows maybe I will if they come out with a patch that fixes all these problems. But as of now this game just makes me aggravatedwhen I plkay it
,Not Recommended,268910,35516477,Posted: 6 October,all,Uncanny Hero,"If this game wasn't as hard as it was, it would be pretty boring.Although that isn't a bad thing, it's definitely something to think about.If you're looking for a visually appealing, charming run-and-gun type game, then you've probably already bought this game. However, if you're on the fence and aren't taken by the visuals... I'd say you should pass. Don't get me wrong, this game's good at what it does. It catches your eye, and you'll either get so frustrated that you'll stop playing, or you'll channel your anger and continue until the end. But... does that make this a good game?Is this game's difficulty due to good, or bad design?The game is fairly simple to understand. You move left to right, shooting everything you see. You dodge enemies, and their projectiles; and you can only get hit a certain number of times before you have to start all over again. No checkpoints, no continues, and I guarantee that you're going to die at the very end of a level quite a few times. It's difficult, even the first level can be seen as difficult to somebody who is fairly new to these kind of games. However, what causes the difficulty?Oh no! Your screen is being filled by projectiles, being flung in a rythmic pattern...You've encountered a boss, and he's throwing things out that you've never seen before. You die, because you're unable to adapt in time. You play again, and get past the first stage... but now he's throwing something else out that you've never seen before! Die again, and restart. Rinse and repeat, until you've memorized exactly what the boss will do. Now it's a piece of cake. You can dodge, parry, and get damage off perfectly. Now, is that good difficulty, or bad difficulty?Personally, I find that difficulty that's based off memorization is pretty... lackluster.It's definitely old-school, which is what this game is going for. Pick up a game like Castlevania, and Mega Man, and you'll be treated with the same recipe. It's notbad, but I certianly wouldn't call itgood. I'd say it's... okay. It's fine to do that, but the game will become less satisfying once you've memorized everything. You'll be able to beat the game almost mindlessly. Unlike newer games, where the difficulty doesn't decrease because of memorization. Yes, you can becomegoodat Cuphead... but will that be because you've become more skillful... or because you know when to press what button, and what each boss is going to do? Also, I'd like to add that sometimes youPlease don't take this the wrong way, as I don't think this game is a bad game.If you're interested in the game, by all means get it. I don't regret getting the game, although I don't think I'm enjoying it as much as I thought I would. It's fun, but I don't exactly feel like I'm getting ""better"" at the game, and I feel like once I know exactly what the boss is going to do... it becomes boring. The visuals wear off, the gags don't have as much kick. The music that has been looping loses its touch. For me, I felt like I was left with playing an elaborate quicktime event.Cuphead is not a bad game, but I honestly feel like it's pretty flawed... and I don't understand the praise.This game feels like an experience. One that everyone should try, if they feel interested. However, I don't see myself playing this game again after I beat it. It's definitely fun to watch, and the developers should feel proud that they've put so much effort into this game, because it SHOWS and I can feel the love OOZING from the game.However, charm and love don't make a game good. What does is entirely subjective, but Cuphead doesn't have much to offer.The difficulty won't last once you memorize everything. The charm won't last once you're playing the game for long hours trying to beat it, tackling the same boss over, and over again.This game's a good experience, but I don't know if I'd classify it as a good game.In terms of gameplay, it's pretty average. It doesn't offer anything new, and what it does, it does decent enough. In terms of the experience, it's good! Definitely worth playing for the experience, if that interests you. I don't recommend the game, not because I don't think people will enjoy it... but because I can't see myself telling everyone to play this. If you're going to hate me for that, that's fair. I'm enjoying the game. But, in my opinion... I'm not enjoying it for the right reasons. In the short time I've played this game, I'm already tired of the charm... I really see this game's praise dying down in a few weeks..."
,Not Recommended,268910,35357349,Posted: 30 September,all,"Pete, King of the Detectives","If anything, Cuphead’s the sort of game that demonstrates how important presentation is. There is absolutely nothing bad that I can say about the art direction or how things are animated. The devs shot for something and they executed on it perfectly. This is the sort of work that deserves to be rewarded, and despite what I’m about to write I think that the game is worth buying simply as a big ol’ “♥♥♥♥ you” to all the lazy indie (and non-indie...) games that get released these days.As a game, Cuphead comes across as more of a demo, or at least a smaller part of a much greater whole. It’s been pretty clear since the beginning of development that the game was going to be a boss rush, which I was initially alright with. Having actually played Cuphead, I’m having second thoughts here. The problem is that by simply throwing you into a boss battle, there’s no buildup. In the (post-Demon) Souls games (yeah, yeah), the stage leading up to a boss is rarely that difficult, but it helps get you into a certain mood. You anticipate what will lie ahead, sometimes picking up clues along the way such as in the game-spanning buildup to the fight with Gwyn. I think that you can apply this sort of thinking to basically any game with well-designed boss encounters: the stage is part of the boss because it gets you thinking about what the boss will be and it can even be used to introduce new mechanics that you’ll need to master to defeat the guy at the end. Playing Cuphead, I could easily imagine the stage that would lead up to each of the bosses since each was so unique; the (6 total) run-and-gun sections actually accomplish this somewhat, but are their own entirely separate and optional thing.The bosses ARE the game, but they could have been fleshed out more. Each one only lasts a few minutes at most (usually ~1:30), and I feel like that’s a real shame. The current system doesn’t allow you to restore health which probably put a limit on how long fights could be. Hollow Knight, another recent and good indie game, has bosses that take significantly longer to beat, usually 4-5 minutes, which mind you is around 3 times as long as the Cuphead bosses. In that amount of time you’re able to get a much better understanding of how each boss works, and it doesn’t feel like they show up just to die immediately after. What’s worse, each of these minute-thirty boss fights is split up into multiple phases, so each phase is going to last an average of 30 seconds. 30 seconds is not enough time for an idea to fully develop. The Sally Stageplay boss has a phase that really caught me by surprise but before I could even finish processing that surprise the phase was over. In a perfect world where the devs had an infinite amount of time to work on the game, I think that it would have been better to cut down on some of the less-memorable bosses (such as the dragon in World 2) in order to lengthen the stronger ones. The puppet in the genie fight is beautifully animated but only has one attack: why not double, triple, or even quadruple its health and then give it a few more things that it can do? With changes like this, it would also probably necessitate the addition of a way to regain health during a fight, which could possibly be tied to the (currently almost useless) parry system.I do have some other minor nitpicks – again, parries seem like they were thrown in without much thought outside of a few instances (the springs in the rat fight, the slot machine in the frog fight), every trinket seems useless compared to the smoke dash, and the existence of ultimately meaningless shortcuts on the world map only furthers the feeling that this is a demo of the complete version of Cuphead. Despite these issues, what this game does well it does exceptionally well, and maybe companies like Capcom will take some pointers from Cuphead next time they try farting out a triple-A title that looks like a mobile game.Taster's score:Presentation: A+Gameplay: C-Final decision: Buy it anyway"
,Not Recommended,268910,35514673,Posted: 6 October,all,Ghatak,"Now, let us all be honest and absolutely clear, if it were not for the aesthitics of the game, this would have been a very, very mediocre 'run and gun' experience.And run and gun too would be a misnomer, if you want to descirbe this game as one. The run and gun levels are few and far in between and the main 'boss battles' which the game mainly consists of are just dodge sequences where you, just play the boss again and agan and again until you've memorised all the patterns and all you then have to do is dodge the attacks. And that is it. Literally. Despite being pattern based, the arbitrariness of the attacks themselves, the platforms which appear on which one has to step in one or two bosses is simply random.If difficulty is based on sheer luck and memorisation then it is no difficulty at all, it is ironic and self defeating to say the least. Now, if this game had consisted something other than boss battles then this would have been okay, but that is all it is, boss battles, and nothing else.As someone else mentioned, the dodge is literally as fast as the normal walking pace, why..?If you cannot advance with a lower difficulty, why is it even there?The developers put a lot of effort into the game, the visuals, the soundtrack and kudos to them for that, credit to them where it is due, no doubt. But did they put the effort where it was actually required?Take out the '30's cartoon visuals (including boss design), the upbeat soundtrack, and this game loses all the good things it has, it is a VERY average. People are just blindened because the graphics are unique.But it has been fleshed out with little else from the gameplay aspect.Despite the charming visuals, it lacks the flavour, spice and punch in terms of it being a GAME. Think about it before raging at the review and getting salty."

,Not Recommended,268910,35356020,Posted: 30 September,all,Chimera,"First of all I beg anyone looking for a sincere review to look deeper into opinions and especially negative reviews(like this one!). The game got an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on the very day it came  out, and that's already a red flag since most of the players didn't even have time to properly play, explore and form a decent opinion about it. In short I got really disappointed with how the game progressed and, in the end, I feel like people are overpraising the game by overlooking its various design flaws while paying attention to its visuals and music, which leads me to my next part.I'll give credit where credit is (very) due, and that's the game's aesthetic and its music, which are both fantastic. It manages to evoke that feeling old cartoons gave(I can only assume, at least), by combining animations typical of that era, combined with jazzy music and some ""low quality"" voice in certain moments to simulate how it worked back then. Despite the fact that in certain levels I was able to feel and mentally visualize the developers placing enemies on a level editor because of how things felt kinda out of place, I can look over that and commend how well made the visual and audio aspects were made. Now onto the reason why I DON'T recommend Cuphead.This game had a lot of hype leading up to its release. Not that many gameplay clips were released, thankfully, and we had that one game journalist display a shameful 20 minutes of his incapability to properly do simple things in a game, which I bet made people even more hyped to play the game and prove the professional and incapable journalist wrong. Well, the game came out and a lot of people started playing indeed! That's good, right? Not when people play barely an hour and start spitting out positive recommendations. I'll explain.I tend to judge games after having a considerable amount of experince with it, and that's arbitrary. If it's an RPG or JRPG, I'll invest a few more hours before puking up and opinion, since I would have barely scratched the surface of such a game if I only played, like, three hours. More action oriented games(Cuphead itself, for example) can be judged with fairly less gameplaytime, depending more on progress made instead. This game's problems start to appear more and more at the end of World 2 and beyond(That is visible to the player, the game has 3 worlds and a ""finale""), and I'm willing to bet most people didn't even get to that part with less than two hours of gameplay, which is the time most of the people who reviewed Cuphead positively have invested in it so far. That is, unless I'm VERY bad at this game(which I believe I'm not) or everyone else with less that two hours is extremely proficient. After explaining all this, I'll move on to the specifics.The first hour of Cuphead was an absolute blast. I was feeling great. Collecting coins, overcoming tough bosses, unlocking new items on the shop and eager to see how they would change my playstyle. As I got to the last boss of World 2 I was still using the same weapon I started the game with, paired with another spread shot weapon that didn't make much difference at all, but allowed me to squeeze a very, very tiny amount of extra damage at very specific moments during the boss fight. I spend a very long time fighting that boss, each time getting more and more frustrated by how its mechanics worked, and never feeling like I was making any progress at all, but rather was learning certain things by muscle memory and hoping that my brain wouldn't glitch out during the first two phases, as I needed to have the 3 Health Points the game offers at that point to guarantee I'd have enough of a chance to actually beat that stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-green dragon.At that point I had been able to purchase weapons that changed my playstyle only slightly, but in terms of dps ended up being exactly the same because of their pros and cons, making me still use the first weapon as it provided more reliable damage and didn't force me to assume a way of positioning myself to shoot that put me in even greater danger as simply existing in this game already does. There are, by the way, health upgrades. What do they cost, you ask? Well, a few coins... and a reduction in the damage you deal. That there is one of the most pathetic design decisions this game made BY FAR, and I'll dissect that in a quick manner. It's basic statistics, really, that the longer you stay in a room, level, or scene with enemies that can hit you, the more likely you are to get hit, going quickly towards 100%. Having more health in Cuphead would feel fair, for in cases where the player is having TOO MUCH trouble, that one extra hit point would allow them to finally beat that difficult boss they had already spend half an hour and about 15 tries trying to beat, but when you lower the player's damage, that means they are going to sit there hitting the boss for LONGER, which, going back to the statistics I quickly went through, means they are more likely to get hit by the boss anyway, almost making the item redundant! Sure, you can equip and unequip health items in order to perhaps make the ""farming"" levels slightly easier to beat, since the enemies are really fragile, but the problem is THE BOSSES THEMSELVES, not those unecessary levels.I'd like to add that the shop absolutely didn't need to exist. The player has to go to these poorly designed platforming ""run 'n' gun"" levels in order to collect coins that sometimes are slightly hidden, in order to have money to buy stuff at the shop. Stuff that most of the time doesn't help much at all. I mean, one of the best upgrades, the one that makes the character's dash give it invulnerability, is available right from the first available purchases, and I haven't used anything else since! It goes in a ""charm"" slot, by the way, which you have only one of. Other items that occupy that same slot include the more health/less damage thing, so you also would have to give up on one of the best(much needed) defensive moves the game has to offer. Having more diverse build options that unlocked as the game progressed and lowkey ""forced"" you to use them effectively to progress difficult battles would make the progression of the game that much more interesting. That is not to mention how the Parry mechanic basically has no purpose aside from improving scoring at the end of the level, and most if not all parriable enemies/bullets/objects could be easily avoided and perhaps it would even be safer to do so. Having parry be a mechanic that helps you regain health or gave you a short boost in damage or ANYTHING really besides a very weak double jump and a bit of special charge would already solve many problems this game's design has, while making the player take more risks by trying out the parries and experimenting more around the level or boss because they could then heal themselves.The way that hitboxes work is not that great either. Generally in platformers, the player and/or enemies tend to have a smaller hitbox than their models represent. That is done to create a more interesting difficulty curve, where the player builds confidence by not getting hit by enemies by ""such close calls"", and getting more comfortable with the world they're in, so they can challenge themselves to get better through experimentation. I have felt in a moment or another that maybe Cuphead also uses that technique, but perhaps the hitboxes are lazily made, enough that the cartoony art style the game has makes it so much more difficult to predict if something is going to hit you or not, not to mention certain things damaging you when there are already enough threats around to make the situation a good challenge(I'm looking at you, Flappy Bird-like section at that pyramid boss).I will give the game another just as serious chance, sure, and come back and rethink my rating in case I end up ""understanding"" it and getting proven wrong."

Usually I have nothing to play with my boyfriend in the evening. When I saw Cuphead's trailer I was confident it would become our favorite evening entertainment and that we would complete this game more than one time. BOY WAS I WRONG!Cuphead is a fun game, but it is an awful CO-OP game. It is challenging in a good way when you play alone, but it becomes annoyingly hard when you play duo. Two heroes look so identical that you constantly confuse your hero with your partner's in the middle of the fight: I've lost count of the amount of times I died because I thought I was in one place, but in reality it was my bf's hero there, same goes for him. Fights are incredibly hectic, the screen is often filled with a dozen of small fast-moving objects and having a second hero jumping around and interacting with things is way too distracting, it is simply too much. It becomes only worse when enemy projectiles react to heroes' movements. When you play alone, it is easy to predict where projectile will fly because it can only react to your movement, but when there are two heroes, projectiles become completely unpredictable and require you to guess who they are locked on to. This game requires precise movement, so standing in the same place as your ally is a huge disservice for him, but there is always only one safe corner, so you just have to overlap. On ""run and gun"" levels the game even kills you for stepping out of screen boundaries.Overall playing Cuphead with another person is not fun. The game is much harder in an annoying way and there is no reward for it. Enemies have much more health, so its not like you kill them faster, on the contrary. Cuphead is supposed to be designed for duo play, but actions two players have to perform are identical, they never HELP each other (except for reviving), there is no synergy. It feels like playing a game at the same time, not together! The game is designed in a way that another player feels like a nuisance, not vital part.We've cleared one and a half island so far and each boss was a pain. After several attempts at killing a boss together we give up and one of us just finishes him alone. Same goes for ""Run and Gun"" levels. Yesterday evenining I went alone to collect missing coins and I was shocked by HOW MUCH EASIER it was to clear these levels alone.If I were to evaluate Cuphead as a single-player game, I'd praise it non-stop.

Too many people are reading like 2 words per line and guessing the rest. Difficulty is not the issue at hand, dispite what you think I mean.-The player is perpetually slow, too slow for the action happening.-You have the ability to ""parry"" but only extremely specific bullets, making it worthless-Parry only counts for score at the end of the boss fight, and often times only 3 parry events per level, making the mechanic meaningless.-Your dash (I've measured this) is the exact same speed as your walk, so theres no point to using it except for the impossible jump distances that mandate it.-Why are the bosses seperated from the ""levels"" entirely?-Killing a boss gives you nothing. at all. it just ticks a box for your progression.-You cant progress without beating the boss on ""Regular"" so why does easy even ♥♥♥♥ing exist if it doesn't reward you with anything except an insult that you aren't good enough?-Hitboxes are pencil thin, so dont bother aiming straight up unless you can hit dead center. You can, and ♥♥♥♥ing will, clearly hit an enemy, but due to their pencil thin hitboxes, you wont kill them.-You have two jump heights, regular, and 20 pixels higher. why the ♥♥♥♥... why bother coding that?-Bosses are brutally difficult. Not even because of their attacks themselves, which after you've seen them are easy to predict. No, instead its because of the randomness of how their actions work. The first boss, the slime, will bounce as his only movement. You have absolutely no idea if its going to hit the wall and bounce back, or if it will hit and fall straight down. But I can tell you, it will be the one that ♥♥♥♥s you over.This is so tragically close to an amazing game, and with a few redesigns, and minor data changes, this would be one of the best platformers in my library.

Note that is was 100% solo, coop is probably fun.Unfortunately I don't think the game is quite ready yet, there are a few main problems.* The first 50% of the game is largely trivial. This isn't quite what you would expect given the reputation but it is ok because it is a learning curve and it is fun and creative at this point.* There are then two bosses which are total RNG fests. This is not ok and represents a big hump to get over. Not in a fun way either, it is incredibly frustrating and you will die a lot.* Once you get over that hump? I one shotted 5 bosses in a row on the third island .. before finally failing against ""a big robot"". I got that one third time :|In general, everything is pretty great, however it just feels unblanced. I'd hold off for a couple of days and see if they plan to fix/adjust things (nerf the charge weapon for instance). The reason is that if you are like me, you'll probably see everything this game has to offer before the game is at its best. Without a solid (but still even) challenge? It just isn't as good as it could be.For the record, just over 6 hours to beat the game, most of that on one boss. That length seems fine once a few things are tweaked but make of that what you will. There doesn't seem to be anything else to do once you finish besides try for better scores. I can see some people trying hard to get S ranks, but I don't think it is that kind of game because that would come more down to luck in several cases.Now problems aside, how does it play? Well the controls are great (once you remap the air dash from the absurd default) and the hit detection is mostly fair (just the flying levels are often a bit iffy). Speaking of the flying levels? They kind of suck and you'll be thankful that they basically throw up no challenge and are done with quickly.On foot and at its best, the game is ""oh I see, try again"". This isn't for everyone, but it is what it is. When a boss ""tenses up"" you'll know they are about to do something, but you have no way of knowing what that is until they do it and you see the result. Of course that doesn't mean you can't avoid it, which is why the smoke dash probably isn't the best design choice. Even without the dash equipped, you just have to learn to dodge something once, then you'll dodge it everytime...... unless doging it relies on a platform appearing... and it doesn't.The parry mechanic is a bit odd. I'm not sure colour is the best thing to base it off, given a couple of ""purple pinkish"" enemies can't be parried but it is fun enough when it works. When it doesn't work you'll be frustrated, especially near the very end of the game. You'll know when you get there...and have to go through the same ~5 minutes again. The challenges dedicated to it are really strange as well, in a ""huh is that it?"" kind of way. It isn't quite a half-baked idea, but it never feels really fully baked, like the game needed something else at some point, and the designers kind of just threw their hands up and ran with it.What these choices lead to is that the first island is the best of the game. After that you are either getting challenges that you already know how to complete or are hoping to get lucky. By and large most of the creativity after the start seems to come from the ""run and gun"" stages. Maybe a couple more of those in place of some of the easier bosses might have evened out the game.Art style? I hated it upon seeing it the first time (why would you want to mimic the crap cartoons nobody wanted to watch growing up? ""When's Ducktales?"") but it is executed superbly and I'm now a fan. The sound is fine and the menus are functional. Load times moving around are a little longer than you would like, but restarts are instant and that is the main thing that matters.So in conclusion, I enjoyed my time with cuphead, even if it did quickly run out of steam. A few nerfs here, a few extra boss attacks there and a couple more run and gun levels and this will probably quickly turn into a very good game and a strong recommendation."

Visually and aurally, this game exceeds the hype.Gameplay on the other hand...  A challenging game was promised. What we got was packed with artificial difficulty far greater than anything the 80s or 90s threw at gamers. There's a lot going on onscreen most of the time. There's so much coming toward you that it's just arbitrary that the greatest danger in many fights is stuff coming from offscreen behind you completely out of nowhere. And you will lose quite enough of your meager hit points from screwing up without the game deciding it has to steal them for no reason too. If old-school hard simply means cheap, then a return to it is nothing to celebrate.When you are lucky and manage to avoid the cheap shots, the boss fights are over usually in under 2 minutes. Once you account for all the time wasted repeating the same level 27 times, there's actually just not that much content. Certainly not enough for finally completing a level to feel like an accomplishment."
,Not Recommended,268910,35442036,Posted: 3 October,all,SanicDaHergedog,"Ok, in the first 2 hours. There are issues. I still recommend it, but it's negative so people can see what i'm saying as this will mostly be negative about the game.I will update this review and maybe even delete it later on as i continue playing but for now i need to get some thoughts out before i go to bed. I also want to say that I love dark souls and challenging games of the same sort. I'm not about to say it's the ""dark souls of platformers"" but it's got the difficulty aspect. I hardly have ever really raged at dark souls besides a few times. I got heated up during Cuphead a bit, but never any sort of blinding rage. This review isn't fueled by rage at all. I want to like this game and I want it to be good. The negative review is to distinguish the issues of the game for people wanting to buy it, instead of blind praise.The game is extremely charismatic. The music, the art style, the everything. All of those aspects are great; although I wasn't too hyped about the style of the game like some others are. Now what if i told you, the charisma of this game is the saving point and the worst part of it. I'll explain futher as that's too generalized.The ""charisma"" of the game is basically what i'm saying to sum up the art style, music, ect. It's not actually saying that the game is too damn charismatic for it's own good. Now the art is pretty, but things don't stand out well enough. Everything's too colorful, and the obstacles that are slightly more saturated with a dark border don't stick out well enough. If you are looking at the boss, you cannot clearly see anything that's to the left (bosses are usually on the right). You CAN see, but not clearly enough. It's like if somebody replaced the overly grey look of shooters with overly colorful animation where now things are just too complicated. Not to mention that the graphics can be kind of blurry with the old film effect making it somewhat harder to see some things. The foreground also has animation that goes infront of bullets, so if you're on the ground, sometimes the foreground will hide it a bit. This is most apparent in flying levels where you're moving across a screen constantly.The animation also lacks... well it doesn't telegraph things well. It's hard to describe it fully. The animations are too calm, and don't have enough cartoony violence with exaggerated motion. This is an action game. A flower boss has a move where he launches and streches out his entire face across the top or bottom of the screen. Don't ask. To telegraph it, the flower's face goes back into it's head and outwards. Again don't ask. Now an example of a better form of animation would be seeing the flower throw it's head back and seeing it shoot it's face like a slingshot. THAT would be telegraphed. Clear and full of cartoony movement. The issue of this poorly telegraphed move is that previous moves put a lot of long lasting obstacles for you to dodge. So those moves are still out there with you focusing on them while the flower has a CHANCE of doing the face attack. It isn't always, so you can't realize a pattern and make a consistent way to dodge it. If you take your focus off of either boss or obstacle then you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You have to look at the boss to see telegraphed moves while the obstacles are attacking you. Now this would normally be fine for how to design the game's fights, infact it's a good idea, but with the animation that can be very blurry, badly telegraphed, blend into the background and blocked by the foreground/other enemies? There's an issue.The animation clashes with the gameplay.  You should be able to notice things clearly out of the corner of your eye. or you should make the bosses moves a lot more telegraphed or make the boss a lot more consistent on it's patterns so you don't HAVE to pay attention every time. There are some patterns that arise but most of them aren't good to rely on. They need to give you a form of consistency past the artstyle with how much is happening for the graphics of the game at once. So without the animation being very useful for dodging, one way to fix it is to make the sound design shine brightly. Audio can be used to great effect, never underestimate good sound design in a game. It is able to make up for the issue of awareness and how unfairly difficult it can be with the visuals only, but it doesn't do it. There is one boss in world 2 with a cake castle that shoots bean knights. It had a clear audio queue WHEN the bean came out. Not enough BEFORE the bean for how fast it can be. If you're on the right side of the screen on the ground? You're ♥♥♥♥ed. There is no time to react to it with audio alone. And you're focusing on quickly mostly floating bosses that restlessly attack you. It doesn't always have to be a specific audio queue. Maybe they could of synced up attacks with music a bit, so you have some consistency on attacks that are out there for a while and persist, but they don't. It's inconsistent and it's randomness can just throw you into extremely unfavorable scenarios without you making a real mistake. It's too punishing for how much control you have. I'm extremely sure after a while, even the blurriest attack can be distinguished, but that's with PRACTICE. Hours and hours of trial and error. You need to build up the instincts for it. It's not something clear from the start nor after 5 times of dying to it. It's built from fighing against the boss 10-20+ times. In later levels. Earlier ones are deceptively easy, even if i expected it to get harder.One last issue has to be the progression. You are progressing to progress. There is no useful reward from a boss. You don't get coins to buy more weapons. You don't get upgrades. You don't get anything besides another boss. That's an issue. You get coins from a run and gun level, aka a non-boss platforming-heavy level. A boss is emotionally rewarding while a run and gun level is mechanically rewarding. It should be more mechanically rewarding for a boss, with run and gun levels being breaks. An emotional reward is hardly much anything without any mechanical reward with it. The other issue this game has is with it's trial and error gameplay, you aren't given many options or moments to change up the gameplay during the repetitiveness. Nor an option of even playing that way in the first place. It's really the same throughout. Sure you get a flying level and a normal boss level but is that really different? It's still holding down the shooty button the entire time while dodging attacks that can be unfairly hard to dodge. Trial and error works, dark souls has that, but it gives you options on how to PLAY through those areas. In Cuphead, almost every new move you come into hits you or sometimes movie come out with a random move that hits you and feels like an asspull stronger than a DBZ character unleashing a new form. These hit you due to bad patterns and the art style. The final phase is the hardest, but reaching there involves trial and error, then getting there involves new things to learn. Trial and error is easier with checkpoints but without checkpoints? It's an issue.Last small tidbit i forgot to add in. Add a health meter and make things that aren't a hitbox more clear. That's a huge help. I can't tell if shooting the boss at some moments is even useful like during a phase change, or sometimes i see something that's not a hitbox at all or things that shouldn't be a hitbox but it is one. I would give examples but running out of characters fast.TL;DR - Review will be updated over time, so far the animation isn't very clear and can get in the way of the gamplay (read full review if you're heavily questioning that). And the other factors of this game doesn't help solve this trial and error issue. Besides that this game is great, this review is negative to be noticed and point out the flaws. It IS harsh, and I understand that, but the reviews need more than ""it hard, 30s cartoon done well, 10/10 no dlc."""

Does this make Cuphead a bad game? No. Some people can get past those things. I stopped wanting to play it after about 8 hours, 6 of which were retries.In terms of skill needed to succeed this game isn't as hard as, say, Super C or Contra SS, but again, RNG mainly and not quite up to snuff controls make it harder than it should be.I was managing to get through the game decently well though, until the robot.

It's a series of consecutive static boss stages with almost no platforming. My main problem with this game is that the game's difficulty is a result of poor game design rather than actual challenge. The game doesn't give theplayer an opportunity to witness an enemy's capability before jumping right in. You encounter a new boss, die on the first encounter to see its attacks and beat it on the second try. As each boss contains at least 3 different phases you'll repeat this process for each phase and you're done. Now repeat this 18 times and the game is complete. To make this even worse there's no progression feedback regarding how much damage you're doing to the boss which can be annoying and makes weapon selection based on damage difficult.Overall the game is all style, little substance."

Everything about this games music, art, boss design, etc. is masterpiece worthy.It's a shame the gameplay doesn't quiet fit the bill. Without full directional aiming, or the ability to aim in a direction you are not facing, the gameplay feels as old as the aesthetic looks. That and many of the mechanics which are teetering beyond something you can 'get good' against and just plain ol' game design ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, make Cuphead a somewhat frustrating experience to get through. If this game didn't have a mindblowing artstyle, animation, music, etc. I feel like there is no way it could be carried on it's gameplay alone.It is saved by all of the above, however. Unfortunately, it doesn't have online co-op. No, there's no excuse for it. That's the difference between thumbs up and thumbs down for me."

Hard in a way I don't find fun. Hard in a way that reminds me of Contra (unreasonable), rather than Mega Man (learnable). Hard in a way that demands time I just don't have time to throw at it right now, and that I don't think I'll find rewarding for a 2d platform shooter.Refunded :("

Again and again you will lose and restart(*) until you have learnt the enemy pattern and timing absolutely by heart, to the micro-second to finally beat the Nth boss...And then do that all again with the next one.

I loved the art style and i was ready to play a new platformer that was difficult. The game really lacks depth and feels overall dull I wasn't excited for the next level and  I became bored with it so fast. It's around 2% platformer 97% holding square or x depending on the controller, and 1% fun animation and nice music. I wouldn't reccomend this game for someone looking for a fun new game, but rather someone wants a short challenge.Finally it's worth noting that the community for this game is awful.

You cant press start with a controller at the title screen, only with the keyboard. This means it will  only recognize your controller as player 2 and the keyboard as player 1 because the keyboard is the controller that pressed start at the title screen. Whoever presses start at the titlescreen is player 1 and there is no way to start the game with the controller, I believe this is a bugI just played the game for about 45 minutes having to control the player 1 character with the keyboard, get him killed so that I can play out the rest of th stage as the player 2 character with my controller. I beat a few boses this way and saw 2 tutorials . Both  of the tutorials were mislabeled. While going through the basic tutorial and the airplane tutorial It has all of the buttons labeled press A. Example press A to jump, press A to dash, press A to shoot. When its really  A to jump,  X to shoot and Y to dash. Seems to me like they released it without even getting the script for the tutorials right...I Watched Dashie Games on youtube last night and I was so excited I decided to preorder the game, this morning when woke up I downloaded it only to struggle for about half an hour trying to figure out why I cant seem to play as player 1. This was the first time I ever preordered a game and it will be the last time. Every game these days requires updates at release in order to work properly. I hope they update this game soon, like now, today. Better yet yesterday.Please do yourself a favor and DONT PLAY IT TODAY! Please wait until they update game. You will be glad you did because its one of the best games out there. Dispite this, the game is a wonderful treat to play. I have been a contra fan since the age of 5 and this game is easily one of the best run and gun/ shooters I have ever played.UPDATE I was just playing the game both of the characters died and the game kept going , I was unable to press start to exit to the title screen."

It shows how the developers of this game love it as the look and sounds really does feel like an old animated cartoon.Behind the art lies another form, it is a very, frustratingly difficult game.This game lets you fight a good amount of bosses. Armed with only few hitpoints, one will certainly die a lot which would lead to replaying the encounter. With each death, lessons are learned like weakspots, strategies or what equipments are best for the boss and its stages. After all that effort, hopefully, the enemy will be defeated. The feeling afterwards would be satisfying. Then off to the next one - rinse and repeat.The run and gun stages are fewer than the actual boss stages. These stages are unique on their own and can be fun to play. They are challenging but fair... until you realize that one can opt to not fire a single shot and try to do a pacifist run. That one is another frustrating challenge on its own.Can't comment too much on local coop as I played it in single player but I can see the fun and usefulness if played with a friend. Share the frustration and the glory. :PControls are responsive and can be changed in the option menu if the current layout is not your style. Replayability is ok as you would like to get a high grade on each stage. There are hidden stuff as well that can be unlocked when certain conditions are reached. If achievements are your thing, there are challenging ones here as well.Overall, I had fun playing this very hard game. It is very challenging and addicting. My rating for it would be 9.5/10.I would say it is worth the price."

,Recommended,268910,35308103,Posted: 29 September,all,Sauce Kaiser,"Having waited three years to get this game in my hands I'd have to say, it was well worth the wait.The game runs and looks gorgeous, each level is hand crafted to feel different and novel each time you play a new one. co-op works great but there are some issues with that, but ill get to those later. This game is QUITE difficult, so be prepared for that. Also be sure to buy upgrades as much as possible as things start to get pretty hairy later on. I'd say more but I dont want to spoil anything, any bosses I talk about in the rest of this review are within the first stage and youll play against within 30 to 40 mins. so light on the spoilers in the con's section!Pros:-Gorgeous world and visuals that harken back to the 1930's cartoon style of the Era-Difficult and frenetic fast paced combat-power ups-co-op***      See con's below for why this is starred-priceCons:-local co-op only-  this is greatly upsetting, for a game like this, that people have waited so long for to only have local co-op in 2017, I personally do feel is unacceptable, you guys were more than able to set up a party system and use steams servers, ive seen people do it that have barely ever made a game before. I would really hope to see this changed in the future.I cant say i havent run into things I would personally like to see changed, when crouching even the slightest movement of the sick will make you move, and since you cant move while crouched (which is inherently fair) you stand up and immediately take damage from whatever you were ducking. I found this to be quite infuriating. As well as I found the randomness of the 3rd stage of the two frogs boss that just felt unfair, but in no way am i saying the entire game is unfair, id say at least 98% of it feels fair and I understand why I died.Though the game does sometimes put you into situations where damage is undodgeable, and that I dont really like either, but its negligable. also, I really really would like the planes dodge to be a toggle sort of thing, as it isnt a dodge persay, but makes you smaller, id rather not use the claw to control myself whilst on a plane level. a small gripe but would increase quality of life!Conclusion: Overall I feel this title is oozing style and finesse and will easily be a great addition to anyones library who loves run and gun/ difficult games. This is an amazing title, though nothing has zero flaws, this title is no exception to that.9.5/107/10 if you cant read *good luck on the tutorial if you cant ;)*"

The soundtrack is awesome. What I like most about this game is that its not a game you can sit down and beat in one sitting. A true challenge. If your the type of gamer that doesnt like games that put your skills to the test then this isn't for you. This is how gaming should be. You need to be on your toes to make it through this game. Collect coins along the way to buy ""power up"" items from the store to help out as the game progress's. (Is that Porky Pig with a mustache??) The wait was worth it, heres hoping for a future sequel. My only real complaint I have is that there is no online Co-Op. I'd prefer to play this with some online friends. Other than that this is one of my top favorite 2017 releases. They really put time in to bringing out a fresh experience that wont get beat in a day and forgotten a week later. I did see that there are some secrets hidden in this game, I refuse to look in to what they are in hopes of discovering them for myself as I play though the game. First Sonic Mania, now this, the bar has been set pretty high for other developers this year. Money well spent here."

Totally nails it in every regard.And the art style obviously goes without saying is one of the best I've ever seen used in a video game. It totally nails the era between the music and the visuals. Just an outstanding game.My one minor, super nit-picky complaint is that there's some input delay between hitting start and being able to go 1 option down to hit ""Retry"" -- I know I'm going to be retrying a lot of stuff because perfectionism and all that, so it'd be nice if there was no delay on that.

So far we have beaten the first Isle and had to stop only because we need to sleep. The game is amazing. The controls are fluid (we are using 2 ps4 controllers), the art is so beautiful (hand drawn/inked!!), the music is epic and most of all, we are having  blast! Yes we die a lot per level but even so, the gameplay is very fun and challenging but not impossible. Once you finally beat that level you've been stuck on, it feels extremely satisfying. Gameplay is a mixture of different and unique levels from boss battles, run and gun, and also classic scrolling shooter where you play as an airplane. There are several different upgrades you can buy as you earn coins from certain levels that can change your shooting, give you extra perks (example extra life but small decrease in dmg) and cool super attacks.

I played through the main game in about 12 hours. All the negative reviews about this game are either trolls or butt hurt boo boo babies who need to get gud because the game is a masterpiece in terms of challenge and originality. Co op actually works fairly well but they adjust the bosses HP so they have a higher health pool when you have a partner playing so the game isnt too easy. Overall I recommend this to anyone who hungers for a challenge and enjoys that nostalgic 1930s atmosphere. If you are expecting a easy game with 0 commitment then this is NOT the game for you. It is not a cheap experience. It may be short but it makes up for it by having substance something very few games nowadays can say.

From the beginning till the end Cuphead is one big experience. The music, art style and gameplay fit perfectly together. You just can't deny how much effort the developers have put into this game. Gameplay wise Cuphead is all about dodging, shooting and jumping while learning boss patterns.Cuphead is probably one of the best recent games in it's genre. Levels are hard, but not frustrating. Every level feels fair and unique. Every boss you defeat makes you want to hop on to the next one just to see how that one is going to try to make you suffer.I highly recommend this game to everyone who loves a challenge and doesn't mind retrying over and over again.

I've never had a death, three bosses in, that I did not understand WHY I died. It's a game of patterns and repititon, but if you're patient and willing to hone your skills, learn boss mechanics, and get familiar with the various stages and learn how to best maneuver them to your advantage, you'll have a good time.Graphics wise, it's amazing. The style is consistant, with very few hiccups- Though there are some boss objects that are (understandably) computer generated to stand out, and not get lost in the carnage happening on screen to get a cheap hit on you.

,Recommended,268910,35511758,Posted: 6 October,all,MeatFestSupreme,"Pros:Incredible artwork and animation.Successfully emulates Fleischer Studios style of animations (think classic 1930s cartoons like Betty Boop, Popeye, and the original Mickey Mouse). Whenever I play, I feel as if I've stepped into an alternate timeline in which 1930s' America had the technology to produce 2D side-scrollers. The game feels ALIVE... the art/animation is absolutely masterful and the attention to detail is unmatched in modern 2D games.Fluid character movement, intuitive controls.I've only played on a controller, but my custom configuration works perfectly. Character movement is super responsive.Challenging.You start out with only 3 hit-points (although you can buy an additional HP later on), so sucessfully evading enemy attacks is a must. Each boss has at least 3-6  different attack variations/phases, which means taking damage early in a fight is the best way to ensure failure. Expect to fight some bosses 20+ times before winning. (I'm at 37% completion and have died 425+ times). I would say the difficulty is definitely more addicting than punishing, although I've heard some of the last few bosses are absurdly hard to beat.Appropriate sound design.Not only does this game LOOK like it's straight out of the 1930s, it SOUNDS like it's straight out of the 1930s.Brilliantly hypnotic and twisted character design.You know how really, really old cartoon characters have a slightly disturbing and absurdist feel to them? Well, Cuphead cranks it up several notches. Beneath their colorful + cutesy appeal, many (most) characters (especially villains) have a deeply sinister, hypnotic, and twisted feel about them. Hell, even the levels/stages themselves have a weird, psychedelic quality to them. Be prepared to feel as if you've stepped into a nightmarish fever dream at times.Cons:Underwhelming weapon/upgrade selection.Don't get me wrong -- there are some legitimately useful weapons and upgrades (e.g. the ""dash"" upgrade, short-range star ""shotgun,"" etc...). But once I found my favorite  loadout, there didn't seem to be much use in utilizing other weapons after the initial experimentation stage.Too much chaos/sensory overload.I feel like this was somewhat unavoidable given the stylistic direction of the game... but the reality is: the detailed, colorful, animated backgrounds (and foreground elements) often draw too much attention away from enemies, projectiles, and platforms. There's just SO MUCH SH*T going on all at once and it's easy to get sucked into the peripheral chaos. Not very helpful when you're trying to dodge 6 on-screen projectiles + 3 mini-enemies + 1 kinetic boss attack simultaneously.Not enough run-and-gun levels.While I've enjoyed every boss fight thus far, I'm a little disappointed that the side-scrolling run-and-gun levels are far and few between. They're seriously fun, but seriously limited.Great game and worth the price.8.5/10"

,Recommended,268910,35320492,Posted: 29 September,all,thecolorblindsniper,"Never written a review before. But I've had my eye on this game for a few months. It looked very charming and as I looked into more about it I find there's been years of blood, sweat, and ink put into this game. So I go ahead and buy the game a few hours before release and get to playing it the afternoon it came out. WOW. I'm really blown away with the art, the music, the style, and the frustrating gameplay. There's a few things you should know. First. This game will frustrate you. You will be challenged greatly, and this is not a casual game. Secondly. The default controls are absolutely atrocious for keyboard gameplay. It's not intuitive to change, play around with it. Right now I have wasd movement, keypad enter to shoot, keypad . to switch weapons, and keypad + to use ultimate moves. It takes awhile to get into the flow of the game. Stick with it! You'll catch on and you'll be jumping around and gunning like a pro eventually. You'll have to resist your need to jump on enemies like Mario or Donkey Kong because you will take damage. Instinctually you will do this all... of... the.... time!If any developers are reading this there's a major bug on ""treetop madness"" where when fighting the boss at the end of the level; getting hit so much as once will get me stuck spinning in the air in place. I can't complete the level, everytime I reach the end of the stage (I got there like 10 times) this bug consistently happens.All in all I highly recommend this to people with patience. I would write a longer more in-depth review but the game hasn't even been out for 24 hours as of the time I post this."

You can really tell these devs spent a LOT of time and effort making this game beautiful and extremely fun to play- Difficulty: [10/10] HARD AS NAILS. This game is extremely challenging but fair at the same time. Requires precise timing and memorization of the bosses forms and when you play co-op... the bosses health doubles. AMAZING- Replayability:[9/10] I see myself playing this game many many times over. It has the Binding of Isaac difficulty but with an art style and game scenario I've never seen before. Once you beat it you unlock Hard mode which I cannot wait to master.This is truly a masterpieceCons:- Can be speedrun in 9 hours or so. I dont mind this since most people would have a HELL of a time beating the first 4 bosses. It takes a LOT of patience and skill to master act one. I can see a LOT people giving up in that time. Thats really it. I want it to be a 200 hour game its just that good.-No Online Multiplayer: Its only a couch co-op which i really wish they would fix... but in the same sentence, there arent many couch co-ops that are on this level or that i would play with most people. I usually default to fighters since there is such a lack of couch co-ops now that don't get boring within 30 minutes. This one I can see my friends and I nailing through a bunch of times after a couple beers without ever getting bored.If you thought you were getting ""a family friendly 1930's cartoon style game""You're ♥♥♥♥ing wrong. Its Dark Souls 4 but plays like Megaman.If you think im kidding... go get it.20 bucks on steam and to be honest i would have paid 100 for this game. Its just absolutely astounding and one of the best games i have ever played in my life. Im on Act 2 right now and i just cannot get enough of the game.The game is incredibly optimized and works great with any controller.I beat one level with my fight-stick and it felt almost natural... but because i played SO MUCH Mega Man as a kid i had a hard time adjusting to it, so the controller it was.It is totally playable on the KBM but this one just begs for a controller and it makes total sense. I have a SNES controller  that i may map this too and give it a shot and try and recreate the old MegaMan/Contra feel.Seriously... dont drink Starbucks for a couple days and pick this game up.

The ""Run n Gun"" sections are good, but not my favourite; but it still manages to be interesting and different.The difficulty also makes the player improve on the bosses in each segment (although I hate to make this comparision, it's similar to Dark Souls in the sense of improving your strategy to beat the boss with enough health/estus).Overall, Cuphead is easily worth the price of $20 and it certainly has a lot of replay value"

Plus I've always been a fan of this 30's style of cartoons. After several delays, the game is finally here.As far as presentation goes, it's fantastic. It never breaks its theme, and everything ties really well together. The graphics/animations are some of the best I've ever seen in a 2D animated game, it's very impressive.Gameplay is a mix of platforming and bullet-hell style gameplay. It's comparable to Contra and Gunstar Heroes, and I suppose a little bit of Mega Man. However, I do feel the platforming levels are a little bit uninspired. Luckily, majority of the game's levels comprise of large-scale boss battles. The boss fights are truly what stand out here, and boy are they tough. It very rarely feels unfair though, so that's a plus. Being able to finish off a boss that has been kicking your♥♥♥♥♥definitely feels satisfying. And for those who might be turned off by such challenging difficulty, there is an easy mode that you can select before each level (which, admittedly, I have not tried yet).Overall, for $20, I feel this is a good package. The gameplay feels good, albeit with a few minor nitpicks. The presentation - graphics, sound, etc - is impressive. I haven't tried the co-op yet. Unfortunately there's no online support for the co-op, which is a bummer. But it's a really fun time even in single player, and it's a joy to simply look at.

The game features Contra/Gunstar Heroes style run and gun shooting and boss battles, with a focus on the latter more than the former. Bosses are diverse enough in their tactics and appearance such that the game never becomes boring, and the scenarios in which you fight the bosses in are mixed up as well, from Touhou style air fights to stationary ground arenas to moving platforming arenas for a boss fight. And a fantastic big band soundtrack feels right at home with the aesthetic.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys A+ quality audiovisual presentation and the gameplay of shoot-em-ups/run-n-gunners.BUT. If you don't like learning boss patterns then this game is not for you. Skip it and find something else. But you probably do enjoy learning boss patterns, and you especially should in Cuphead where the enemies' tactics are so diverse."

The boss fights are difficult, but it is so much fun to watch the animations of the different phases and attacks that I found myself smiling even if I died and had to restart (50 or more times in some cases haha)The controls feel pretty good and there is nothing in this game that is too difficult, or 'unfair'. I could nitpick about a few small things, but honestly the only bad thing I have to say about this game is that I want more! Taking about 8 hours to clear on the hardest difficulty available for the first play through while playing recklessly, I would definitely love to have another few worlds.

There is no health replenishing within individual levels (If there is Ihavent found it yet, maybe an equiptable ability). A lot of the bosses take multiple attempts to memorize their attack patterns as well as landing the Parry Attacks which are extremely helpful since each Parry Attack gives you one Special Attack use. i am honestly enjoying this game a ton from the music, to the art style, as well as the difficulty. Just be sure that if you are trying to do Regular Difficulty on anything that you are prepared to be smacked around a bit and die multiple times before you can get the patterns for the bosses down. Also the Mauselium Levels are probably the easiest thing in this game, they will also help teach you as a player how to time Parry Attacks and land them."

When the game's store page says it emphasizes boss battles, it is underselling it a little; it's mostly a boss rush game with a couple of platforming levels per area; not a bad thing, but not neccesarily what I expected. I was anticipating levels leading up to the bosses instead of just being in the boss arena immediately, so I thought I'd make a note of it for anyone considering buying the game without seeing much gameplay as I did. Nevertheless, highly recommended."

I would gladly pay money to watch this game as a cartoon it is that good. The devs painstakingly followed the hand draw cell methods of that era to capture an authentic feeling. This is evident in not only the visuals but audio as well. Without a doubt this is the biggest draw of the game, one worthy of great applause.Number 2: the gameplay itself is entertaining and well thought out. It combines the simple mechanics of run-and-gun platforms of old (mega man, metroid, metal slug, Mario....to many to list) with enough depth and customization in the form of power ups that provide a feeling of character development. These upgrades are needed as cuphead is difficult...hard....challenging...so much so that this is the third component.Number 3: It is not a stretch to say cuphead is a tough game. As a purveyor of difficult games (xcom series, dark souls, doom nightmare, etc) cuphead stands shoulder to shoulder in them with raw challenge. At the moment I can not recommend cuphead to the casual, easily deterred gamer. Most platformers are formulated as being 2 parts running and gunning enemies and 1 part bosses. Cuphead reverses this formula. The vast majority of the game is boss battles, and they are tough. Each boss has unique attacks and stages that will test your skill in every way, dodging shooting parrying at a level that requires near perfection to be successful. Each boss has multiple stages where they evolve or change into more difficult versions of themselves and the weapons they use against you. You will die a lot....a lot. You will die just to learn the rotation and garner some sort of pattern, you will die even when you know all these things because of the sheer skill required in this game. Which brings me to the final review.Components number 1, and 2 are undoubtedly positive ones which make this game great. However number three can be the only perceived negative aspect. Based on the only negative reviews I have read (52 at time of writing compared to the 2,000 or so positive ones) the vast majority of these negative reviews come from the sheer difficulty of the game. Personally I relish the challenge but do not blame those who would avoid this game for it. If xcom had iron man mode as its only mode, or doom nightmare, etc it would be easy to see why these games would limit there audience. My only critique on this game would be to include an easy mode. While boss battles offer a simple and regular mode (I do not want to know what lies beyond regular) the only way to beat the game is to collect contracts, which can only be collected on regular difficulty. The addition of an easier mode that would allow one to still beat  the game would be a welcome addition. Further including more run and gun levels, which are both incredibly fun, and provide a way to view the amazing artwork of cuphead while serving as a nice breather between the countless bosses to be faced.Overall this game gets a highly recommended 5/5With the small warning.....those who are easily frustrated or defeated, look elsewhere."

Replayability is not only dependable of its side-quests and difficulty post-casual mode (which is already very challenging) but the game is incredibly satisfying to watch because of the complexity of its hand drawn designs inspired by early cartoons from the 1930s. Cuphead can be easily positioned side by side with the games mentioned above if not the best modern shoot 'em up due to its accessibility regarding skilled players and challenging difficulty. The only negative thought I can think about is how short the casual game is which may be too much to ask for a game that is fully drawn by hand."

,Recommended,268910,35354098,Posted: 30 September,all,Andy,"This game should really cost $30. The value in graphics, boss design, and sound of the game is worth more than $20. I will say though, a few bosses felt unsatisfying in defeating them, as they were notably weaker than the other bosses in the same zone (and I believe the concept was to have each zone have bosses of the same difficulty). However, I would say about 90% of the boss fights were both enjoyable and, when you did manage to defeat them, incredibly satisfying.For people curious about game time, I completed the whole game on normal in 10 hours. After defeating everything on normal difficulty, you then have access to expert difficulty which enables you to earn an ""S Rank"" on any boss. I would say getting S Rank on every boss is going to take me another 30 hours or so, but honestly some boss fights are so enjoyable, both visually and mechanically, that I could see myself playing this game for an hour here or there after completing all there is to the game.Overall, Cuphead is a game that, for this price, is well worth anybody buying, even if you don't particularly enjoy the genre."

Lives up the hype!I personally would include this game as a must-play for any self-proclaimed gamer (or game journalist) along with Super Mario Bros and the Dark Souls series. Yes, the analogy of being the ""Dark Souls"" of platformers is correct, even in the story, which made me smirk.The visuals, the audio, and the controls are some of the best you will find in any contemporary game. The game totally delivered in its hype. It kicks the♥♥♥♥♥♥of so many triple A $59.99 games that this feels like a steal.For those worried about difficulty, you can choose between Simple (easy) and Regular (normal) for each stage.Here are some of the (very minor) cons I feel:- Wished there was an option to remove the ""olde-times projector effect"" and just give us the clean visuals.- No online co-op mode.- Some keys cannot be re-assigned, like Z, Enter, Shift, etc. If you use a Steam Controller in keyboard mode you'll have to re-assign keys in your controller directly.- Wished lock-on was similar to Cave Story, where you could jump, shoot facing the same direction. That was very helpful against bosses.- Pressing down completely stops the character. I have died a couple of times due to pressing left/right along with down. I think ducking was unnecessary in this game.- The tutorial is slightly different from Mr. Dean's notorious demo, so we cannot make 100% exact side by side comparison runs.- Give us Cuphead Steam Profile Backgrounds! I'll pay sweet money for 'em.Please do yourself a favor and get this game. I already feel I owe money to these developers for how good this game is!"

There is a good variety of bosses, and the run and gun stages are very fun and hectic, too. The reason I didn't give it a solid 10 is because the game is about learning from your mistakes and playing the stage over and over until you perfect it. I myself like this type of difficulty, becuase the game forces you to git gud. You feel your skills improving, and i love that. Though, I understand the trial and error isn't for everybody, and might discourage some people.Graphics- 15/10Cuphead is easily one of the most unique and beautiful looking indie games that came out possibly ever. The 1940's Fleischer animation style is just filled to the brim with charm and creativity. The bosses and enemies are designed very creatively, and I can't wait for to see how the bosses will look later in the game. The graphics kept me smiling even after all those deaths I suffered. The game is so loyal to the style, that it really feels like you're playing through a cartoon straight from the 40's.Sound- 11/10The sound is equally as authentic and loyal to the era as the graphics are. The music is a lot of upbeat jazz that's just really nice to listen to. I especially love the title screen song. The sound effects are very 1940's-esque aswell. It's made by human mouths, and i just love it.Difficulty and Fairness- 10/10The difficulty is just excellent. The game doesn't hold your hand, but it's not ball-bustingly impossible, either. There is a lot of trial and error, but I like this because like i said before, the game forces you to improve and get better. Sure, you CAN buy items and weapons that'll make your life a little easier from the shop, but the game is still very much based on skill, not luck or items. This makes finally making it to the end of a level, or landing the final blow on a boss all the more satifiying, especially if you were struggling.Overall 11/10Cuphead is an excellent indie game that was completely worth the wait and delays. I implore you to buy this game if you're a fan of games like Contra or Mega man, if you're a fan of animation, or even if you're just curious. Cuphead is a gem that's worth every penny, and I'm eagerly waiting to see what StudioMDHR has in store next."

Difficulty levels for the mini boss fights labeled (simple and Normal)2. A scoreboard for you to track how good you are at the game.3. A coin reward system for completing non-boss levels that in-turn can be used to upgrade your character(s) abilities.4. An overworld akin to super mario wold with a bit more choice/options on level picking.5. Simple and easy to understand controls.a few things to people who can't handle difficult run n' gun side-scrolling games:1. You will die a lot if you want to be good at this game.2. You will need to watch for patterns.3. the mini-bosses have set patterns for the types of abilties they use, but be aware they can and will make slight adjustments to timing, which you will notice over many attempts.4. There are as far as i know an infinate amount of continues so don't worry about losing progress on completed levels.5. this game does not play favorites, you will die a lot.Side notes for people who might find them of use:1. the steam link seems to have some issues still with the Xbox360 wireless controllers. you night find some issues with ghosted walking controls from time-to-time.2. the game plays great without steam link.3. wired or wireless while connected to the main unit plays fine for me.4. i do not advise playing with a mouse+keyboard, but is an option for people who to.5. i will be attempting to play the game with a arcade setup with a custom stick and buttons i will update my review to reflect the tests worth."

A lot of pattern memorization for bosses, but with some RNG sprinkled in so you can never get too comfortable. Expect to have to give most levels quite a few go's (10-15+ for me on average, I'd say). This isn't a game where you should run in thinking you can speedrun everything first try or you'll get smacked pretty hard. Take your time memorizing patterns for bosses and enemy layouts for run & guns and it starts to feel easier. The slight frustration from coming so close to beating it numerous time is there but you always get that nice payoff feeling having finally gotten that KO or stage clear. Phenomenal artstyle and good jazz/swing, keeps you guessing what's coming next, worth every penny and more. Wouldn't recommend for salty gamers who don't like having to repeat stages in order to learn how to play them properly."

,Recommended,268910,35398308,Posted: 1 October,all,A Choice of Chicken,"It's definetely not what I had expected when I preordered the game. I expected more of a Mario-like scenario with an assortment of bosses to fight throughout the game. That being said, here are my notes:Pros:+ Phenomenal artstyle. Well-made and has a cool scheme.+ Mechanically, this game is sound. The standard keyboard controls aren't great, but luckily those can be changed.+ Fun boss fights.+ Good music and other forms of audio.+ A choice of how you fight. Different weapons and defensive items you can buy with in-game currency.Cons:- It lacks content. Games strictly based on boss fights alone are not fun in my personal opinion. Again, I had hoped the ""overhaul"" to include platforming mentioned in the Steam News was true.- When there is platforming involved, it's short and might as well not be present.For $20, it's amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys challenging boss fights."

It's fine if you are the kind of person who is willing to sit for hours and die repeatedly while you figure out enemy patterns.

The controls were extremely responsive and the few environments I visited were beautiful and varied.As someone who studied animation this game is nothing short of gorgeous. But even for people who are not, the animations are absolutely buttery smooth and will make anyone nostalgic for that style of cartoon. Everything has been done to give it that old timey aesthetic from the film grain to water color backdrops.Difficulty wise it is challenging, but I would never say unfair or frustrating. It has hit that perfect mark where even if you lose and lose, it only enboldens you rather than makes you want to quit. However with the intuitive controls and the sheer charm of the game, even the most inexperienced gamers will find this game a treat.So all in all, I would highly recommend for fans of animation history, platform gamers or even simply gamers in general.Also Dean Takahashi is a complete and utter moron and the games press could win some heavily lost faith from gamers if they made sure he never grabbed a controller again in his life."

It just oozes personality and charm with the quirky, personality filled animations to the lovely soundtrack.. The bosses are also very distict from each other with many different phases and forms that range from 'oh, ok' to 'wat?'The only game I can really compare this to is metal slug, except that the run and gun and the boss sections are seperated (which isn't exactly a bad thing mind you, since the difficalty is right up there with metal slug.and you'll be broken very quickly without a good set of reflexes and practice.)All in all, I recommend cuphead, especially for the visual art and animations."

I've never been a big fan of ""bullet sponge"" bosses, either.In regards to its gameplay, Cuphead embodies the ""Run & Gun"" genre to a T -- nothing more, nothing less, and replete with bullet sponge bosses.However, I can't step away from Cuphead too long:  the art and animation are superbly done, a real pleasure to view.   The game's audio is equally great, featuring music and sound effects which truly capture the on-screen action and atmosphere.Yes, anyone can say, ""just watch it on youtube.""   I'd say that the ability to interact with Cuphead's world is a gaming experience that shouldn't be passed up.Wonderful effort from Studio MDHR; the game's success is well-deserved."

It's a great homage to 20s animation and 80s shoot-em-ups in one package. From the first level (or the tutorial if you're from the mainstream media) this game takes every opportunity to make sure you know it's a difficult game. Limited weapon sidegrades and practically no saving graces with no health pickups or checkpoints in-level. Only a combination of skill and luck will ensure you pass through these stages successfully. It's hellish, but what do you expect when you make a deal with the devil, I suppose.If you're up for the challenge, the game's controls are tight and responsive and, while some level architecture and enemy positions might hinder you or your weapons slightly on the first take, it plays very well once you get a feel for it. It's clear they've taken the design of this game very seriously and you should definitely give it a go if you're up for the challenge."

If you've seen any footage of Cuphead you already have an idea how great it is graphicaly. Both in characters and backgrounds. However, you may not know how amazing the sound direction is until you get the chance to play it. Both usage of sound effects and music is great. Many times part of the story is sung to you and when the song reloops it plays without lyrics.Gameplay is challenging but it's very within the realm of getting used to. Controls work fine and the items you can equip are very impactful. There's a degree of strategy to what loadout you take to a given run n gun or boss fight.Now please realize the game is baseline $20 and has the level of polish that it does. If you've ever enjoyed contra, gunstar heros, looney toons, merry melodies, or good game direction get this game."

I don't believe I need to mention the glorious artstyle or music / sfx, but I will mention the gameplay is fantastic. It runs as smooth as spread on butter, and is inventive when it comes to the actual boss fights. In fact, most of the game is boss fights, with only a handful of missions being that sort of run-and-gun platforming like you'd see in an older Mario game. If you're looking to fight some nasty bosses (and die many, MANY times,) then buy Cuphead. Surprisingly, despite my many deaths, I haven't actually been frustrated with this game (and I frustrate rather easily at times). Cuphead is such a quality game, that you realize it's surprisingly fair as you play it. When you die, you realize it was because of your sloppy skills, not the game tossing some BS at you.I would have to jump aboard the proverbial train and give this game a 10/10."

This game has lived up to all of my expectations and then some.As an older gamer, I have fond memories of the kind of games where if you make one little mistake, you die, and Cuphead is just a tad harder than that.Or perhaps I'm just not that good at video games anymore, thanks to being wussified through all the hand-holding of the latest titles.Anyhow, I couldn't say enough good about this game. It's rare that I can find interest in a 2D game these days, and rarer still that I would ever consider a game as being 'perfect', but Cuphead is, in my honest opinion, just that.Amazing job devs!!! Can't wait to see what you come up with next! :)"

Plus you can literally see how much effort the studio has put into this game...that itself deserves a great applause & support !Gameplay is run and gun but has a great freshness to it, game is not that hard, if you learn to pick up the bosses' attack patters.A definite buy for any sensible gamer !

,Recommended,268910,35340719,Posted: 30 September,all,Throw Rug,"I really enjoyed Gunstar Heroes and Contra Hard Corps so I knew I would like this. The controls are tight and while the difficulty is fairly high (Closer to Hard Corps than Gunstar) I always felt my deaths were fair. The art of course is beautiful and shows a ton of attention to detail, and the music and sound help make you feel like you're playing a 1930's cartoon. It's all very worth the low asking price.A couple of nitpicks: The run and gun sections feel a little tacked on (because apparently they were) but the boss fights really need to be seen and played to be believed and more than make up for the more generic sections. That being said, once the game ramps up in difficulty even the run and gun sections are more enjoyable especially when they have minibosses of their own. Some of the super specials feel like they do a little too much damage (to the point where you can just skip a boss section almost entirely if you want) but it's not a huge deal.I really liked how balanced the powerup items are. They have meaningful drawbacks either through giving you an assigned disadvantage or through making it easy to do one thing but harder to do another. For example, the dash that gives you brief invulnerability also makes you invisible. So while you can use your dash to avoid certain attacks, you lose the ability to change directions in midair while also being completely sure where you're going to end up at the end of the dash. So you can dodge something nasty but also find yourself emerging in the middle of the boss if you're not careful.Overall, it's been a great experience. I wish more games rewarded the skill you develop while playing it like this one."

This is an old fashioned, old skool shooter at its heart. You have to remember the sequences and shoot accordinly. It is brutal in that there aren't any saves but this take me back to 70s shooters.The mechanics aren't orginal because it has gone for a specific market and it has absolutely nailed it. Be prepared to get seriously annoyed with this game. I also love it that my kids get very excited when I play it as it looks great.I think the price point is very reasonable and this should absolutely be on your games list.A word of caution, this type of game isn't for everyone as it can be challenging, but I find it ultimately rewarding.Well done to all those involved as I absolutely love this.

I never saw any gameplay that looked interesting or fun and the only plus I saw of this game was the 1930's cartoon style, Damn was I wrong.Pros:-BEAUTIFUL art/graphics (obviously)-Great music to match look and feel of the game-Diversity in weapons (When you get upgrades they dont feel like upgrades. They feel like new tools for different jobs, you need to match the tool for the job)- fun &smooth animation considering this was hand drawn-plot is fun and reminds one of the old saturday morning cartoons our parents/ grandparents use to watch.-Bosses are EXTREMLY fun to fight and offer a variety of ways to beat them due to the gameplay.-Bosses are also very diverse in look and combatCONS:-Little buggy as of launch- No online coop, only split screen and local.(but I read somwhere they were gonna add that in)-Platform Jumping can be difficult to gage due to the art style of the gameOverall this game is very fun, and pretty difficult. Its worth buying at full price. I'd give it a 9.1/10"

Bosses and enemies are great. 9/10 for me. My only gripe is that there is no online multiplayer.  Is it doubtful to think that they might add this feature? Anyone know?
,Recommended,268910,35359183,Posted: 30 September,all,Kaijuicyfruit,"Even though i'm fairly early into this game I had to write my review for my experience so far.First of all the game absolutely bleeds character. From the painstakenly hand drawn animations from literally E V E R Y T H I N G (Literally everything you see has been hand drawn in traditional form) right down to the sound design of heavily compressed audio and that crackly charm as well as that gorgeous soundtrack. You can tell that these developers have bled blood, sweat and tears into this game and is a breath of fresh air in terms of what to expect nowadays with modern day devs and the abundance of tools they have at hand.Secondly the gameplay. This game feels extremely tight to play. All its controls feel great and when you press a button you know what to expect. When you mess up you're the one at fault not the game which brings me onto the next point. This game is hard. And its not hard like a character has an undodgable attack like in dark souls like that there's an attack that involves a lot of pre planning, thinking and implimentation. A lot of my times in this game I face an enemy's attack, die and get mad. But instantly I compose myself because it was due to me, the player for that ♥♥♥♥up not the game and that's the beauty of this game is that it's a challenge but never frustrating that you mess up because YOU'RE to blame.There's a multitude of attacks at hand and I can tell I've just scratched the surface of what to expect.Next, the bosses and there's a Lot of them. Each of them feels that they've been individually crafted for their own abilities. Usually each boss has about 3 phases and you can tell that each phase is meant to challenge, teach and test the player in what they know and it's an incredible experience in learning what makes them good and bad.Overall this game deserves a pickup. I haven't come across a thing i hate just because I can tell that this is the game the developers wanted to make even though it took them  3 years to get to where they are (which is an insane achievement in its own)This game deserves a pickup if you're a fan of shooters, side scrollers and a lover of this style. You wont be dissapointed with however much money you drop on this game."

I just completed the game for my first time on Regular so I thought now would be the best time to share my thoughts about it.I had a blast playing Cuphead. As another reviewer mentioned, it is tough but fair. Some fights are easier than others but the hard ones take a lot of practice to beat. Beating each boss feels extremely rewarding - a feeling I rarely get from games anymore. Cuphead does nothing to hold your hand. There are no 1-ups or checkpoints. You have to play to near perfection. I love a good challenge so this style of gameplay is right up my alley.Other thoughts: The animations and soundtrack are insanely good. Every stage and every fight feels unique. The game ran without a hitch on my system.Do yourself a favor and buy this game. It is easily worth $20 and we have to reward those willing to take risks in game design!"

Technical performance is amazing, however one thing I do notice is the lack of borderless windowed and the framerate with vsync turned off will go above 60fps, however goes down to a 60fps lock and remains there once inside a stage.Get this game.

Boss battles are creative and challenging, although it's not super-difficult (perhaps growing up in the NES era is an advantage for games like this...). After a few tries and getting the pattern down, most bosses shouldnt take too long. Would have liked to see more of the platforming levels as there are very few and are somewhat underwhelming. The game is fairly short as im only 4 hours in and I'm 77% through the game. However, given the massive undertaking of creating levels for a game like this due to the artwork alone, it's understandable and hardly something to complain about. The game is priced perfectly at $20 and worth every penny."

They are shown with details about some of the level designs, concepts, and descriptions of how the game is played. Occasionally, when the game does in fact release, you get flops (like ""No Man's Sky""). Most often, the game ends up being good/decent. But this game doesn't fit either of those two categories. It fits into a third category; games that are beyond amazing!Upon launching the game, you're immediately given that ""old-timey cartoon"" feel that you've seen through it's trailer videos. The music greets you warmly, as well as identifying the overall plot. You read/see the opening storyline, you complete the tutorial, and then you enter the world map and wander around looking for the first level to jump into. And like the trailer videos have also shown, the moment you enter the level (most of them), you're thrown right into a boss battle.You move, you jump, you dash, and you shoot. But most importantly, you dodge. And failing to dodge results in taking damage that can only be recovered by one of two methods; beating the entire level, or (almost all the time) dying/retrying.So say you survive, and do enough damage to a boss. You see it pause or disappear. And soon after, with the majority of the bosses you fight... you see it mutate. With each change, the level becomes increasingly more difficult to complete. You make small mistakes, like timing your jump wrong, forgetting to shoot an destroyable enemy/obstacle, failing to anticipate what the bosses do next. You repetively restart, hoping to last longer, or use a new tactic/weapon/skill. And then finally... after all the stress and suffering... you beat the final boss in the level.There's an overwhelming sigh of relief as you see the words ""A Knockout!"" appear on the screen. You get a graded score based on how you managed, and then you exit the level. But, the moment of rejoicing disappears as you realize... there's more levels to beat...(ok, enough fancy explaining)Is it rage inducing? Yes, more for some than others. But is it fun despite the difficulty? ABSOLUTELY!The graphics are smooth, and the filter used only adds even more to the ""old-timey cartoon"" appeal. The music is amazing, and fits the time period. The mutations/changes are creative, and catch you off guard easily, but it makes it all the more challenging.I'm currently typing this only having to still beat one more level in the second world, but there's no doubt in my mind that the second half of the game will be just as enjoyable as ever!"

Don't let crittics whit barely any gaming abilities intimidate you, it is hard, but not imposible.Overal, cuphead its a great adition to your collection, I find it a gem worth every penny spent, MDHR gave it all to make this game posible, and you can see how much pasion they gave to this game, so kudos to them for bringing a game that is a perfect homage to the nostalgia of cartoons and arcade games."

Once you get the mechanics and buy the better weapons, the ""Regular"" difficulty becomes more doable.

Hearkening back to the unforgiving side-scrollers of the NES era (Contra, I'm looking atyou), Cuphead is a nostalgic gem in terms of gameplay.What sets this apart from anything else on the market right now, what mkes Cupheadfresh, is its visual style. Completely eschewing current-generation digital art and 3D whiz-bang effects, the developers have chosen to cast the entire game in the style of a 1930s-era cartoon animation (even going so far as to use cel animation and other tradition techniques). The end result is a surprisingly difficult visual masterpiece- my brain cannot decide whether I'm playing a game or watching a classic cartoon.Congratulations, StudioMDHR. You've created a real gem here. I hope to see you create another Cuphead game (given the subtitle, I smell a new franchise) and I really don't care if it takes another three or four years to make it, because this level of craft takestime.Great job! I'll be recommending this to other gamers I know and I hope to see more from your studio in the future."

The music has that rag-tag flair with a very excited trumpet player going insane.The gameplay is also very solid. If I had one minor complaint, it's that when you try to shoot directly up, the collission can be wonky sometimes and it's not entirely centered so you do have to get used to that. The default controls can be a bit difficult to always nail down on keyboard so there's been a few accidental deaths in my run that have been due to that. But honestly these are more of nitpicks.This game is one of the few that honestly should be sold for MORE than $20 for how much went into it, but at $20 it's a must have for anyone who appreciates the old-timey aesthetic or just loves a fair but difficult boss-rush/run-and-gun platformer.TL;DR: I'd give it a 9.5/10"

The vast majority of the game consists of fighting bosses in their own levels, with a few standard ""get from point A to point B"" levels (which are NEVER a walk in the park), this game never stops for a moment to throw another punch at you. Each boss has so much personality, it's absolutely iconic. Successfully beating a boss takes one to three minutes each (after finishing the first dozen), making failure an embarassing memory you sweep under the rug as you try and try again.The controls are SUPER slick, super smooth, and very satisfying. Even the small range of additional weapons and passive power-ups you bring to each boss are great, helping you deal with a boss that positions itself in awkward tight spots.My only complaints are bosses have randomized attack patterns, meaning muscle memory takes a lot more time to adapt to. This makes replaying the boss over and over yields different results, which can be good for difficulty and mix-ups, and bad for innexperienced players to intense platforming and bullet hells. This is of personal opinion, and not a fault of the game.Overall, this game is an instant classic. I can't believe how far this game has come over the years in development. Absolute dynamite job, this game hits it way out of the park."

The game is incredibely challenging, and does so in a decietful way with its happy and cheerful artstyle.The game is absolutely brutal at points in difficulty, and I've spent around an hour each trying to beat several of the bosses, but it has never felt unfair and I never felt like the game was just annoyingly difficult. The game is brutal, yes. Does it ever feel unfair or as if a death is the fault of the game? No. It always feels like my death is my own fault; I jumped at the wrong time, I overshot a jump, I didn't press a button in time or too early. It creates an amazing amount of replayabilty, as you always feel as if your death was your own fault and so you wish to continue to get better and progress and complete the level; it never felt repetitive repeating a boss 30 times over. It grants a huge sense of accomplishment when you finally do defeat that boss, and it feels amazing.The art, though, is obviously the drawing point of the game. It's absolutely beautiful; every single character looks unique and lively, and is a joy to watch and look at. The animation is smoother than a newborn baby's bottom, and the game is just so vibrant with character. The little puffs that appear whenever you defeat an enemy is just priceless.The sound design is on par with the gameplay and art, as well. It fits the game so well, the music, the sound effects, the noises characters make, the shopkeeper's voice, everything.I have a genuine love for this game after only six hours of play (At the time of writing), and one day of ownership. It is easily my favorite game that I have picked up and played in 2017, be it newly released or older, and one of the best games to be released in the 2010's, in my opinion.In short, it's a mastah-PIECE."

The cel-shaded animations are meticulously drawn frame by frame in the style of 1930's cartoons, creating something you've truly never seen before. The game consists 90% of boss battles, with the other 10% being gun'n'run levels to gather coins. With 3 ""isles"" and several bosses per isle (with two difficulty modes) this is simply more than worth the $20 bucks. Oh, and not to mention the music, which is to DIE for. I've been driving everyone in my house crazy cause I'm humming these tunes everywhere I go.*Side note: the game is best played on a controller, as the keyboard controls can get a bit wonky. If you have a DS4 (Dualshock 4/ PS4) controller, make sure you turn off DS4Windows and use Steam Controller Configs instead because it causes an annoying bug in the game where it spawns the second player for coop (Mugman) and tries to make you use the keyboard controls instead.If you've come to the bottom of this review, WHAT ARE YOU DOING - BUY THE GAME ALREADY!"

It has the creative boss design of Dynamite Headdy and better. Every boss has it's own personality, and every battle is somewhat randomized which offers a bit of a surprise. The non-boss levels are not as intense, but it's a means to rack up on coins to buy stuff. Reminds me a lot of Alien Soldier in that aspect, the middle non-boss platforming is meant to be a down-time for the more hectic boss battles. This title is screaming with originality and creativity.All in all, it's a solid title. Looking forward for more!!"

I've spent a few hours in game and have only beaten one boss on the second island. But, despite this, it's very satisfying when you defeat a boss and you feel the need to want to go on even when you're having your faced shoved down in the dirt.But, it does have a few problems. For example, there have been a few times I've gotten caught in a frame and had to restart. Not only this, but in the Baron Von Bon Bon fight, the last stage of the boss literally won't register that I'm hitting it and I'll go at it for 5 minutes and the progresss bar shows I've done no damage once I've died.Still, I have to recommend this. It's really satisfying, and even though there's no online co-op (bummer) the couch co-op is pretty great."

Totally recommended to hardcore gamers.Casual gamers like me should stick to Minesweeper or Solitaire.. At least you will feel that way after playing this game.
,Recommended,268910,35375467,Posted: 1 October,all,Freeza,"Cupheadis a blast and delivers on its promises on every level imaginable. The art style in this game is simply one of the best I've ever seen, creating an atmosphere that reminds one of old school cartoons from the 40s. Every single boss has a very recognizable characteristic while their different animations flow perfectly into one another.Cuphead's score also capitalizes on that retro feel, composed of playful jazzy songs whose tempo matches the game's fast-paced gameplay style.First off, I'd heavily recommend playing this with a controller. I found that it was easier and more intuitive than mouse and keyboard but your mileage may vary - that's purely a subjective aspect of gameplay. As I said, Cuphead is a fast-paced combat platformer and it's freaking unforgiving. This game is NOT for those who can't accept a challenge, or those who lose their temper easily. While every new level makes your jaw drop and your ears ring with pleasure, you won't have much time to contemplate before the harsh difficulty appears.Simply put, it's fun as hell. Regular levels offer a decent amount of challenge but bosses are where it's at. Oh man.. The boss stages are composed of a multitude of little parts which define when the boss will change its appearance and its attacks. Their charisma is only matched by their relentless moves against you. While it is true that the game can beverydifficult at times, it never feels unfair. This is a core component of a good use of difficulty; the player has to feel like he's getting better and better at the game, not that he's facing unfair opponents with over-powered moves. Don't get me wrong though, youwillget angry at times, but you'll also feel an immense sense of accomplishment whenever you beat a level. That is the beauty of Cuphead, and I'm happy to say that the final product is worth the wait.- Strongly recommend -"

The button mapping on PC is a bit odd but you can remap it as needed. Studio MDHR worked so incredibly hard on this game and I sincerely hope they get back what they sacrificed and then some.

,Recommended,268910,35317337,Posted: 29 September,all,❆SubZeroDestruction❆trade.tf,"Cuphead: A game made in 2017 by StudioMDHR Entertainment Inc., yet seems as if it came out of an old arcade machine...There isn't that much negative so I'll try to make this as short as possible.Pros:Amazing Sound Track!Boss Fights Galore!Beautiful Art Style!Can Run On Basically Any Computer.Many Unique Character Designs.Some Replayability.Great Animations.Cons:No Online Co-Op ""Currently"" (As if that is a major reason to not play it)There are currently 19 bosses which while they are amazing and have at least 2-3 stages minimum. Most boss fights can be done in 6-12 minutes or so if you know what you are doing, or are insanely lucky. So that may be a slight let down to those who may have wanted longer fights. However, with that being said, there may be future updates to add more bosses; or expand onto the current bosses in new modes which if either of those occur then this will turn into a Pro.There are only 3 worlds ""currently"" and this can be either a Pro or Con depending on how you see it; However I'm considering it a slight Con based on it coinciding with the amount of total bosses.No Story Mode persay other than the overall task of getting the souls for the Devil, but that isn't a real drawback towards the game. However it could have been a great addition.Side Note:It may be just on my setup, but tabbing out does cause the game to go into a ""Borderless Fullscreen"" that doesn't bring it back to true Fullscreen. However this is fixed simply though by going into the resolution settings and changing it once, and this may just be a Windows 10 issue as it does occur in a few other games.After further playing, once in a while the game seems to stutter for a few seconds which has causes a few deaths. Hopefully this will get patched at some point.Final Verdict:For 19.99$ (20$) Is the game worth it? Hell yes it is! Cuphead can run on almost any decent computer, and will give at least a day worth of enjoyment or more depending on your own skill level against the boss fights. However, if you don't find keyboard controls to be the best for this game, then you will most likely require a controler to have any form of comfort when playing. Does that pull away from the game though? Not really, it will just be a slight hinderence to some.Personal PC Specs used while playing for this review:Intel HD Graphics 5500.Core i3-5020U CPU @ 2.20GHz8 GB Ram.Game Settings Used:Fullscreen @ 1366x763FPS:Solid 60I hope this has helped you on your buying decision.Edit 1:Correction ontotalbosses, from 16 to 19.Edit 2:Added a new note on small game stutters."

The game difficulty is hard for sure, but it has never felt unfair.  I forgot all about dashing for about 3 fights, but I never felt cheated out of a death (at least not yet).  Even when you die, the game tells you how close you were to winning, and leaves tick marks on a line showing where the boss transforms or changes phases, plus each phase of the bosses has a little quip / taunt against you, so it might even be worth it to die on different parts of boss fights just to see what they have to say."

Every boss fight has an ideal strategy discovered through trial and error. To avoid stress, it’s helpful to think of failure as a greater tool than any weapon.The game isn’t designed for true gamers to race through with nothing but raw skill and unearned confidence. If anything, the boss fights punish pride, filling stages with minions, projectiles and traps.It is a difficult side-scrolling shooter with relentless boss battles that demand rapid-fire actions and reactions.Cuphead has been a longtime coming, and it's great to see that it lives up to its initial promises. It's beautiful to look at, and with a pitch-perfect soundtrack, it flawlessly captures the era its developers so clearly revere. It's also an intense action game that pulls no punches.

I find myself swearing more than I expected to while playing this game, but that's a good thing. There is a genuine sense of accomplishment after defeating bosses and despite the fact that some bosses took quite a while for me to beat, I haven't gotten bored because the phases change through each playthrough to keep you on your toes. My computer is several generations behind and it runs great.  My only complaint would be that the default key bindings and controls are a little wonky (on both keyboard and controller), but thankfully you can change them to whatever you find most comfortable."
76561198046973166,Recommended,268910,35413857,Posted: 2 October,all,Dillinger Radio,"Quick Summary:This game is easily worth the money. Eye popping hand drawn animations and backgrounds, beautiful musical scores, vicious gameplay with memorable boss battles that are delightful - and frustrating - to figure out all contribute to make this title more than worth the purchase for anyone who enjoys a stylish challenge.Long Read:Cons:Parry is a poorly implemented yet essential skill in this game. It's a small window of success, it takes a moment after jumping to be able to activate, and it's hit or miss in consistency. For example, if a projectile is above you it's much more likely you'll just hit it and take damage. This is primarily due to the fact that Cuphead requires some travel time before parry becomes an option, making vertical parries very difficult to pull off if they're not at the peak of his jump range.Effects can obscure the gameplay, heavily. The effects in this game, like everything else, are hand drawn and beautiful. A real treat to watch. Unfortunately, they can occasionally obscure gameplay going on behind them which can lead to some hits being taken which otherwise may not have.RNG is a real nightmare in this game for anyone pushing for the Pacifist level goals. With the randomized enemy spawns, randomized enemy projectile formations, and screenfulls of enemies to dodge while simultaneously staying on tiny platforms (I'm speaking specifically about a level called ""Perilous Piers""), well, it can be exceptionally maddening. To be fair though, there are some loadouts which could make running pacifist goals more tennable.RNG can lead to unwinnable situations. When I say unwinnable I don't necessarily mean game breaking, but rather it can sometimes cause the player to be in a situation where taking damage is unavoidable. This is most obvious in the dragon boss fight (Grim Matchstick). The platforms that you need to stay on during the fight are randomly generated, and on more than one occasion I was left with a significant enough gap that even a dash jump wouldn't have gotten me safely to the next platform.This game is short, depending on your skill level. I was able to complete it in about five hours. That said, beating the game and perfecting it are two different beasts, and I imagine I'll spend more time going through for a perfect run.The challenge is real. I've listed this as both a con and a pro, because some people will find the challenge in this to border on unfair or outright unejoyable. Make no mistake, this game will punish you for every slip up. It demands you understand the controls and beating it will require you to damn near master them. Each boss is different and has different patterns it randomly employs throughout its phases. While there is a simple mode to make the boss fights throughout the story easier, this is not an option on the final boss. If you're not looking for a challenge, probably best to pass on this.Pros:The graphics in this game are jaw-droppingly gorgeous and buttery smooth. The creators hand drew every single frame of every single object, and their dedication and passion show in spades. It is even more exceptional to see firsthand than it is to see in videos. You just have to see it.The music, much like the graphics, immediately brings the feel of classic cartoon era tunes and melodies to life. It's well made, wonderful to listen to, and timeless in its appeal; particularly when set to a video game with such beautiful imagery as this.The challenge is real, but not so far over the top as to prevent it from being accessible to virtually everyone. Cuphead has pulled the very best parts of all the classic hardcore games we remember from our childhood and removed all the frustrating elements. The resultant gameplay is exceptionally difficult, but incredible intuitive and familiar. It's an old trope but it holds here: the gameplay is quick to pick up, but difficult to master. The game is punishing, but generally speaking each failure was my own and there were very few times I felt I could legitimately blame a game mechanic. Beating a boss fight could sometimes be an arduous process, but seeing the win screen - regardless of score - was incredibly satisfying.The controls in this game are tight and handle very well. Jumps feel good and tight, movement is precise and pleasing. Movement feels just right, and works very well within the environments. A little more control over jump height might be appreciated, but as it stands the controls feel spot on so it's a non-issue.Summary:Go ahead and just spend the $20. Seriously. Stop reading this and go buy the game. It's an absolute gem with a great price tag. The animations and environments are beautiful, lush, exceptionally drawn pieces of art. The music is fun, upbeat, pleasing to listen to and perfectly reminiscent of the original cartoon era. The controls are precise, fluid, and dialed in perfectly. It's exceptionally challenging while simultaenously being intuitive and accessible.This game isoutstanding."

The new artstyle is much more bright, colorful and cartooney than any other ""Dark Souls"" game, which is usually looks more bland and uninteresting, and almost everything in this game wants you dead, but so do you want everyone dead according to the Devil, so it's a win-win situation.This new installment in the ""Souls"" series is just filled with awesome yet bizarre ideas like one minute your fighting against a Pirate Captain then BAM you're now fighting against a monster ship, like seriously, what were ""Namco"" drinking while making this game, moonshine?Pro's:- Everything in this game is fully hand-drawn (and it's drawn in the old 1930's cartoon aesthetic).- The bosses are really tough and require a lot of reflexes and strategies in order to destroy them.- The soundtrack is amazing (it's so good I busted like 4 nuts on my keyboard while listening to it).Con's:- It's just like ""Dark Souls""- It's just like ""Dark Souls 2""- It's just like ""Dark Souls 3"".- It's just like ""Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edtion"".- It's just like ""Dark Souls 3 Deluxe Edition"".- I still can't beat the tutorial (it's just impossible).- It's just like ""Dark Souls 4"".- It's just like ""Dark Souls 5"".- It's not actually ""Dark Souls 4"", but according to gaming journalists - this game is just like ""Dark Souls"".- It's just like ""Dark Souls 2: Prepare Your Body Edition"".Overall - 1000/10"

Feels about as challenging to me as an adult as lots of platformers did to me as a kid. Very little run & gun or bullet hell gameplay, mainly bosses, so lots of the game is just about remembering patterns and anticipating attacks. Feels a lot like the bosses in the modern Rayman games or some of the old Disney ""Illusion"" titles."

76561198071504428,Recommended,268910,35481381,Posted: 4 October,all,UberShyGuy,"I wanted to completely 100% the game before I made a review. Before I get into anything, I want to thank the developers for extending the game past the original length of the game, thus giving it more substance.Now into the review!I will go into detail on three things: quality, quantity, and replayability.QUALITY:It is obvious that the animation is smooth, but the gameplay is smooth as well. I have only encountered a handfull of minor bugs and exploits throughout the game. Other than that, every death felt like I deserved it. Even at times when the game had thoroughly tossed my salad, the playful and fun animation kept me from getting genuinely frustrated. It is obvious that they made every effort to replicate a 1930's feel. I actually found myself thinking that the game came out in 1930 so I'd say they nailed that on the head. The filter on the screen to make things glow and color bleed like an old timey cartoon certainly made the 1930's-feel more authentic. It takes more than just the drawing style to have that genuine old-timey look. As for the variety, every boss and enemy have unique character qualities, death animations, behavior, and attack patterns. Each boss is so memerable I could probably name them all off the top of my head. And since the game is relatively short, it's easy to remember the whole game and enjoy it in its entirety.The major bosses in this game really want you dead. To call this game a bullet hell is not entirely accurate, as the projectiiles, rather scattered clumsily, are methodically placed so that you will dodge out of the way of one thing into another. You cannot stand still anywhere, as you must keep moving and dodging in order not to get hit. Every boss plays slightly differently each time you die and restart, so memorising a certain attack pattern wont entirely help you. At this point you just hope that the boss uses the easier of the attacks so you can deal more damage in that time.The plotline to Cuphead strays from the usual cliche of hero saves the day/damsel in distress. In Cuphead, the two protagonists are actually gamblers and manage to lose to the devil. From that point they are simply doing everything in their power not to die. This is a very subtly done yet relatable story that is easy to follow. Every boss because of this felt like Cuphead actually walked into a bar and picked a fight with the meanest person there. There is an understood three dimentional backstory to every character on screen and it makes it feel like the world is truly alive.MINOR SPOILERS: as for the ending, albeit brief and abrupt, cuphead and mugman are shown to not be half bad, after seemingly killing all residents of Inkwell Isle. This innocence wraps the game up very cleanly with no loose ends.GAMEPLAY SUGGESTION: Perhaps it would have been useful to be given the choice to play as Cuphead or Mugman during single player mode, because throughout the game you are reffered to as ""you two"" even though it is only Cuphead that can be seen.QUANTITY: Cuphead has three worlds and a final-boss-eque area. There are only 6 run and gun levels, 18 bosses, and quite a few minibosses. This might not seem like much but the difficulty and quality of each boss certainly drags out the game time. It is mostly beneficial, however, that the game is brief, because otherwise the game would feel way too lengthy for its difficulty. Personally I think you should get at least as many hours as the amount of dollars you spent on the game. I was pretty decent at the game right off the bat, so I could have easily invested another 7 hours perfecting it.Outside of the levels, there are many different power ups and short side missions on the world map that will have you looking up tutorials on how to complete them. MINOR SPOILERS: There are many secret modes such as 2-strip color mode, black and white mode, and classic audio mode. All of which are unlocked by completing certain tasks the NPC's hint at but never directly give you an objective.REPLAYABILITY: This game is amazingly fun and I could imagine myself playing this game again and repeating certain bosses just for fun or to watch my friends react to its creativity and difficulty. But once you beat it, the game will have really worn you out and the organic animation and traditional style becomes normal in your mind and at that point it just feels like another colorful sidescrolling boss rush. The ending wraps up everything so neatly, the game doesn't leave much for you to think about. But this isn't really the kind of game to have you ""think deeply"" about it, as that isn't what 1930's cartoons are known for. I think that the feel of the game was maintained at every level and I respect the developers for so creatively limiting themselves on that front. MINOR SPOILERS: Once you beat the game, an expert mode is unlocked for each boss, allowing you to play a much harder, and faster version of the regular versions of the boss. This gives a little extra to the sadists and completionists who thought this game wasn't hard enough.I give Cuphead an astounding definite buy. If the 1930's era is your taste, this game will 100% satiate your appetite. You don't need to be into boss rush or side scrolling shooters to enjoy this game, as you will find yourself enjoying it no matter what you're doing. I wouldn't recommend waiting for a sale because buying this game at full price is definitely worth it. With only a few scratches, this game perfectly fits in with the classic animation of the 1930's."

It definitely sticks to the 1930's-esque art style.Absolutely glorious soundtrack. I didn't hate a single song in it. And like before, it fits the theme, being new-age style jazz.Gameplay is difficult, yet fair. There's next to nothing I encountered that wasn't able to be expected or caught.Story is straightforward and simple. There's no overarching parts, it's just how it should be.Cons:Occasional glitches that have caused a death or two. While infrequent, it still was a bit of a nuisance in some situations.Later bosses start to drag on for too long, making it more frustrating to lose to them and start from the beginning.The devs of this game absolutely devoted themselves to this game and it shows.

Moving Cuphead is a joy in and of itself, which is good when you have to get familiar with your protagonist to progress in this game. It's punishing, never truly unfair; because the movement is so solid, you never feel as though a death was not your fault. In short, difficulty as it should be.Outside of gameplay, Cuphead is outstanding. Having grown up watching a lot of the cartoons that inspired this game's aesthetics, every level incorporated some new element that whisked me away to my childhood, be it in the voice work, visuals, or sounds.

76561198160099370,Recommended,268910,35458602,Posted: 3 October,all,Man Quail,"This is a game I have been very excited for and it didn't dissapoint. Every boss was unique and memorable, having various attacks, patterns and transformattions that they utilize. Not only that, but there were no clones of previous boss fights in this game, in addition to this I was genuniely suprised and delighted on many occasions by the absurd and over the top nature of how many of the fights played out. And the icing on the cake is that overall this game is very fair. It was a rare occurence that I actually thougt something was kind of cheap (this was usually because there are a couple of bosses where the foreground would occasionally obstruct my view to a small degree, but it was nothing game breaking, more just somewhat annoying). Combine this with smooth controls and (if you couldn't already tell) some of the best visuals I have ever seen in a game and ""Cuphead"" stands out as one the best games I have played this year.My only major complaint is that the ""Run and Gun"" stages felt lack luster compared to the incredible bosses. While many of them would have at least one section of interesting platforming a lot of them felt like basic jumps with a bunch of enemies spawning on screen, which wasn't really all that fun or interesting. These stages weren't necessarily bad, just kind of bland. Thankfully these make up a very small portion of the game.I give a strong recommendation to anyone who has the stomach for a difficult game."

,Recommended,268910,35507892,Posted: 5 October,all,Hairy Fireman,"Preface: I adore this game.Overall, Cuphead doesn't necessarily do anything new. If you've played Contra, Megaman, River-City Ransom, Mario, Binding of Isaac, etc. then you essentially know what you're in for and it'll feel extremely familiar. The mechanics aren't new, the controls feel very responsive and tight; when I died, I knew it was my fault and I couldn't blame the game. You move through a map, click the level, and either fight a boss, have a ""tutorial"" where you control the character while the background is what button does what so you can mess around with it a bit, or ""Run-N-Gun"" where the games listed previously would have more relevance.However; the art-style, soundtrack, and voiceacting are what legitimately makes this game enjoyable to me. All of it was hand-drawn and then digitized, it's a colorful and beautifully drawn world with what I think are interesting characters. The humor is well-done and isn't shoved directly in your face. I would recommend buying the soundtrack, because it really makes up a wonderful part of the experience of Cuphead and is just that great of one, overall.Watch a few videos before committing to buying it, unless you were excited for its release when it was talked about back in 2014. I'd recommend everyone to try it, but legitimately because I think art-style and music like this should be supported by a lot of people. I doubt Cuphead would have seen this amount of success if the art-style were any different, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad game, either.Few bugs here and there that I've found, but not game-breaking in any way. Just minor annoyances with the Treetop section and the tree enemies sometimes not dying after 3 minutes of making sure they might.10/10 in my opinion. The developers obviously poured their hearts into making this fun experience.."

It's a Co-op game which you can have two people playing together. Very fast paced, and time based. The levels each have a setting for 'Simple' to ""Regular', but even in simple the game is pretty difficult, On average to actually beat one of the levels you may be playing for about 30 minutes before beating a boss fight.I noticed a lot of people complaining about the controls, just to let you guys know you can always change it to the standard controls. I would recommend changing those, because the way they had it set up was to move up and down was Letter Z and X or something like that.

REALLY HARD. The early bosses alone could take several attempts, even on Simple difficulty - and you'll need to beat them on Regular difficulty to proceed through the game.-Parry-Slapping feels a little bit finicky. I might be messing it up, but there will be times I'm mashing Jump when about to hit a pink object, but still take damage for some reason. The Automatic-Parry Charm became practically mandatory for me.-The Run-and-Gun levels aren't all that fun, but you need to do them to get most of the game's coins so you can buy new powers.-The Chaser bullets tend to home in on less-than-ideal targets; one boss shoots projectiles that shoot MORE projectiles when shot, so of course my Chasers would repeatedly home in on those instead of the boss.-I wish the boss's health pool was on screen rather than only visible in a game over screen, so I can get a better idea of my progress than just getting different phases. On the other hand, seeing the boss at a sliver of health may cause you to throw caution to the wind and end up dying, leading to more frustration.-Use a controller. (Also, if you're using a PS4 Controller, turn off DS4Windows; in my experience, it made my whole computer freeze up for about 30 seconds when I started or closed the game, or open the Steam Dashboard. The game has native PS4 Controller support anyway.)BOTTOM LINE: Get ready for a beautiful, charming, fun, BRUTAL adventure. And bring a friend, because misery loves company."
,Recommended,268910,35425425,Posted: 2 October,all,Andy457,"Cuphead ReviewTLDR: It's good, play it.Cuphead is quite a gem. The visuals are incredible and draw everyone in. The controls are simple and feel good and the game is super simple. The game focuses on boss fights with only having a handful of side scrolling levels. The game feels very difficult at first, but the game does a great job of teaching you how the fights work and you progress over time. I feel like the difficulty was pretty perfect, not too easy but not too hard where it makes you want to break your controller. I was able to beat the entire game 100% without looking at a guide or videos or any form of advice.Some more specific insight after completing the game:Try different weapon combinations. After the first world, I got stuck at a boss and then I remembered that you can unlock other weapons. Many of these weapons will do very well in certain fights. I honestly didn’t use the small 3 way spray once until the very final boss. I spent most of my time using the bullets that went back and forth. Really helped to clear the random trash mobs that fly in. The auto aiming weapon is actually pretty great do despite its lower damage. You have to look away from your target often to dodge things; being able to just hit your target regardless of which direction your facing really adds up over time.I didn’t get a lot of mileage with the other supers. I just used the first one. I also used the immune dash power up for awhile, but switched it for the extra life later on. Again, I felt like the benefit of having another life was better than doing more damage.Summary:All in all, I mainly love the solid design of this game. Both in visual and gameplay. Most AAA titles nowadays are boring and full of complex menus and just feel like a drag. Games like super meat boy, thumper, transistor and Cuphead (and more) really make me enjoy playing games. If you are a fan of classic action games, play this."

I like the challenge, and the combat, level design, and boss battles are all really interesting, but to me the style and music get in the way and make it too annoying to play for more than like 20 minutes at a time.While it didn't end up being really my style, if you actually like the art style and music, and are a fan of challenging platformers, I would highly recommend it."

I thought it'd be longer than it is but after learning how the game was made and seeing all that was put into this, I completely understand the length. I LOVE this game. May end up being one of my favorite games of all time. If you like old school difficulty, 1930's vibes, and insanely hard boss battles.. you will definitley get $20 worth out of this game. I would pay more if it cost more. Game is just that good. It's difficult, it's original, it's just awesome. i would absolutely love a DLC for this game.I love almost everything about this game. There's 2 bosses imparticular that I did not like though. I didn't like them because they just felt like a cluster****. Only difficult because there's too much going on. One of these bosses is an encounter calledJunkyard Jiveand the reason it's so hard is because there's too much going on. Badly designed boss imo.I wish there were more ""Run'n'Gun"" sequences and that the ones in the game hade more to them.I also feel there could've been more shot types/weapons.Those are my only gripes. I love almost everything about this game. I have heard people are experincing controller issues. I've been using a DS4 and have had no issues whatsoever, so it's not effecting everyone. Overall probably the best game that'll come out this year. A must buy for old school gamers and people who want a challenge.ALSO.

,Recommended,268910,35458628,Posted: 3 October,all,LostSoldier20,"As an initial impression, close to the end of the 2nd Island, the game is fun but not nearly as punishing as the fanbase makes it out to be. Perhaps a lot of this is thanks to that one Journalist being horrible at the tutorial but the game is far from that punishing. Most fights barely last over 2 minutes. If you get a par time kill, you're probably under 2 minutes. For a ""punishing"" game that isn't a lot of time lost.Most of the time spent on it being ""hard"" is spent on being risky with your tactics, or going for A+ ranks. The par times for stages aren't listed, so the goal is to just push the boss down as fast as possible. This also reduces how much you have to dodge but what you dodge will be far more dangerous since you'll be swapping to the shotgun for high damage. Most bosses reward distance and don't punish taking your time. So for a casual run through, you'll have very few issues.You can argue that getting a high rank is the entire point, but there are plenty of people just going through for completion. There's yet still a section of these people saying the game is ""so hard."" Maybe they're more casual gamers (hence them not going for A+) and probably on the lower difficulty too. Would explain why the game is ""so hard."" Meanwhile, I might get caught off guard once or twice on a blind run, but I'm sure if I adjusted my play to be more defensive, I'd one shot almost everything.There's also a bug on some running stages where the par time is impossible to achieve. The 2nd running stage is apparently supposed to be a par time of around 1:40. People have gotten pure speed times of 45 seconds and still not gotten it. I've even managed to get 1:05 for the ""perfect"" run including stops for parries and not riskinking a hit against the boss, playing safe and killing it. Still no A+. So now your playtime is extended while you bang your head against an impossible to beat wall on more than one stage.All in all, it's fun and I can recommend it, but if you're not going to go for good ranks or Pacifist runs, or any sort of completion outside of a quick A to Z romp, you'll not get your monies worth. But hey, maybe Island 3 and beyond will change my tune"

As I started playing I noticed how immediately this game is Tough and honestly more unforgiving than dark souls which doesnt bother me. My only problem with the game is the randomness of it and completely unpredictable hitboxes. Sometimes you're able to hit things and sometimes it just seems to go through them. Same with cuphead. There will be some instances where I should not have been hit and yet I get hit. Other times Ill say to myself ""I 100% should have gotten hit""""But Zenthloc"" you ask, ""Why dont you play on the simple mode"" I have. Its still tough as♥♥♥♥♥♥and Ill tell you what.

,Not Recommended,268910,35383518,Posted: 1 October,all,Quentin Vance,"Right now, I have played the game for around four hours, and I have one boss left in the second map of the game.I wanted to wait until completing the game before I wrote this, but I feel like I've experienced enough to know my opinion about Cuphead won't change anytime soon.The ProsThe arts truly recreate the ""30s feeling"", both in graphics and sound.Each boss battle is unique and all the characters are lovely in their design.There is a nice variety of power ups that adapt in a great way to all gamestyles.The ""Gun and Run"" and ""Mausoleum"" parts are a nice touch.The ConsMost parries don't really work as intended: some have weird collisions which usually result in the player taking damage, while others sometimes don't actually allow an higher jump.Enemies can easily spawn directly underneath the player without him knowing, resulting in a waste of hit points.It is impossible to regain lost hitpoints and there are no checkpoints: combined with the two points above, this results in very frustrating sections of the game.Most boss battles have multiple attacks at the same time: chances are that the player will find himself stuck on the ground by a mid-air attack while a ground attack is performed (e.g. in the Beppi the Clown level), resulting in an inevitable loss of hitpoints.Some bullets have weird collisions, it happened too many times that I was hit by a bullet I visibly didn't actually touch.Sometimes parries don't get counted at the end of the level (got a 0/3 in a level where I executed at least 10 parries).Some platforms simply seem to have no collisions at all after being hit (Gun and Run levels).ConclusionIn conclusion I can say Cuphead is a great game when it comes to the arts, and the efforts put into it can be seen from the very first seconds of gameplay. On the other hand, however, the game lacks polishing when it comes to the actual gameplay, where too many sections are just a mere matter of chance and luck, rather than skill or timing. As a person who used to create this kind of games, I know the struggle. I know sometimes you can't really have all patterns work in synergy. However, I personally wouldn't feel right to release a game with such major fun-breaking issues.To me, most of the difficulty in this game comes to pure chance. It's not a matter of ""If I try again I will get better"", but rather ""If I try again I might have more luck"" and that is not how games should work for me.I was convinced by a friend to keep trying, give the game another chance. Now I just feel like I should have asked for a refound while I could."

The levels are incredibly challenging, so if you're looking for a tough game then this is it.  The graphics and music are great, the overall aspects of the game are fantastic, it really is a type of 30's style cartoon, the likes of which I have never played so I've really enjoyed this.It almost reminds me of Dragon's Lair, the 'cartoony' aspect to it, which is great!  The problem is the game is so difficult, for 1 player that is, that I'm not sure that a follow up to Cuphead would do well.  Maybe I'm wrong in thinking this, and at the end of the day the game was only $20, so a follow up could do well if it stays on the same price point.  I just think they really want to grow their audience for the game they should've made the game a bit easier, because even the ""simple"" setting is still somewhat difficult.The way to make it 'easier' is to simply have checkpoints.  Get to a certain part of the stage and then start from there, but that doesn't happen, you have to start at the beginning.  (SMH)  I get it... I really do, that a lot of people will like you have to start over, that it's a challenge, but in my opinion a game should be challenging, not frustrating.  If this game allowed you to start at a checkpoint in the boss fights I would recommend this game with flying colors, but for some reason the developers didn't do this.  I'm still not sure why.Overall, should you get the game?  Yeah, I guess so.  It's kind of fun, it's visually appealing, and it's certainly not like anything you've played before.  Is it the best game ever made?  No, but I don't think it was trying to be.  It's smart, it's different, and I have enjoyed the game even with the frustration of it.Are you missing out if you don't get it?!?!  No, honestly, no.  It's fun but after playing it I can't really recommend it to everyone out there.  I'd recommend watching videos of gameplay before you buy to see if you really do want to get the game.  I'm not hating on this game, it is incredibly unique, but I just know it won't be everyone's cup of tea (yes... that was a pun)."

76561197976360550,Recommended,268910,35322606,Posted: 29 September,all,rossoreilly,"EDIT: So I eventually got the game to work and as such am editing my review.First of all, the game is not as hard as the critics have made out. Anyone brought up on arcade run and gun games and other shooters shouldn't have much of a problem completing the game on regular difficulty. Getting the A-S grades and finishing the game on hard mode is much more challenging, but I'm not far from accomplishing that after a couple days of play.The game itself is one of the most beautiful I've ever played, both graphically and in terms of its audio. Everything is oozing with character and I love it for that.As a shooter, it does have a few issues that can lead to some unfair deaths. First, bullets often fly behind other objects in the game world such as large cartoon explosions or other enemies. This is a big no no for any shmup for obvious reasons and it surprises me that the devs let this fault get through to the final game.Another slightly unfair aspect to the game is the way the EX attacks work; your character is invulnerable while doing the animation, but the second you come out of an EX attack, you become vulnerable. Seeing as the animations often take a couple of seconds, this means that you could start one in safe space, but by the time you come out of it, an enemy or projectile could have spawned on your character leading to some unavoidable damage.I hope these issues get fixed by the devs but even if they don't, it's very difficult not to recommend this game. Along with Sonic Mania, it is perhaps my favourite game of this year. Great stuff!So I just bought cuphead and assigned the buttons to my arcade stick, but you can't navigate the menus with the joystick and buttons, you have to use the keyboard.Ok, so no big deal, but then the game starts and you can't progress the story without hitting enter on the keyboard, pretty annoying but still not a complete deal breaker.Then I get to the 2nd level where there are two frogs as a boss, when they turn into a one armed bandit slot machine, I simply had no idea what to do. I must have died about six times trying it over and over. It turned out, I had to press enter on the keyboard to activate the slot machine. Yes, in the middle of a boss fight with projectiles flying at me, I had to take my hands off the stick to press the enter key. ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. Did they even test this♥♥♥♥♥♥"

I can easily see this going toe to toe with Super Mario Odyssey.The frantic bullet hell shooting of some bosses is matched only by the insanely tricky and inventive platforming and minion-bashing varieties of other bosses each with their own strategies that change up each time you restart, so you'll never be able to memorize any specific set of strategies, forcing you to change up and adapt on the fly.  Fly between tons of objects being thrown at you and shot at you for a boss such as Djimmie, while you need to manage your ability to platform for the Fairytale Dragon.  You have to able to parry quite well for the Boxing Toads, while skilled dashing is required for the Karnival Kerfuffle Clown.  Add in their own abilities and stage hazards, minions, multiple phases, and it creates bosses that are each memorable in their own way.The sound design mimics the ragtime and swing-era music of the 20's, with a soundtrack that's almost as expressive and colorful as the animation itself.  You'll be shooting down over-sized carrots and frogs to the beat of frantic trombones, trumpets as cuphead snaps his fingers to the beat for an attack.As for the golden achievement of the game, every single thing here, save for a moment or two (such as the miniature background on the Djimmie the Genie stage), is traditionally hand-drawn and animated as such with lavishly painted backgrounds that feel alive.  It's hard to stay angry for long after losing, with the wonderfully animated bosses, environments, objects, and such, you'll be saying ""F***"" right after dying, only to be grinning intensely as you plow through the stage again, listening to the upbeat swing music in the background and the cartoonish villains springing to life before your eyes in a dazzling display of effort and workmanship.Not every indie game has had this much time, effort, sweat, blood, and tears put into it, and it shows.  Though not to put those others down, as clearly not every game can come out as pristinely crafted as this one, this was truly a work of passion, and deserving of every bit of praise and money it recieves.  Everything from the animation to the gameplay rivals everything from the finest of run and gun shooters/platformers, to even, dare I say, some of the finest animations from the 30's and 40's.  The gamble on the unique approach to this game was worth everything the developers put forward for it.An instant classic."

I ran into 2 bugs in 7 hours of playing, neither of which really affected me, besides being a minute distraction.Cuphead is easily in the top 3 games for 2017 (in my opinion).Just a disclaimer, this game is meant for those who like Mega Man, Ghost and Ghouls etc. You know the ""I am almost guaranteed to be running this same level 20-30 times just to learn the bosses attack/movement patterns."" genre.Please try this game, I promise you will not be dissapointed.It is worth every dollar."

I had to fight for a surprisingly long time just to beat the starter island, yet hearing Mr. King Dice's theme song for the first time afterward made it all entirely worth it. I actually set my controller down at one point to take a drink of water after beating a boss & realized that I was gripping my controller so hard during the fight that my fingers were going numb.I actually ran into a bug on save slot 1 that caused one of the bosses to only award the ""Easy mode"" rank victory, preventing progression in the game, and had to restart the game in slot 2 in order to progress. Normally, such a bug would be a complete deal breaker & I'd refund the game instantly, but the game is so fun & rewarding to play that I'm actually giving it a pass. Seriously, I can't remember the last time that beating a boss in a game was so damn satisfying, nor when it felt so hard-fought for.If you like platformers & feel up to a challenge, I fully recommend buying this game. It's well worth the very reasonable entry fee.Just be sure to start your game in slot 2."

At the I didn't know it was a game that had not come out yet cause I was mainly skimming the article, but the idea seemed awesome.A quick summary of my experience so far:Opening sequence, intro story cutscene and subsequent tutorial: left a massive grin on my face that could not eat any more♥♥♥♥♥♥than it was already eating. ""Oh alright this is pretty awesome.""First level:Jump, shoot, dash, death.Jump shoot dash jump shoot shoot point up dash absolute ded.JUMPSHOOTDASHDASHPOINTUPTURNAROUNDSHOOTSHOOTSHOOTJUMPJUMP-AAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHHH.To anyone who is still uncertain about purchasing this game:DO IT.You absolutely will not regret your decision. The visuals are absolutely amazing, and show the obvious fact that an impossible amount of love has been put into this. The animation is so fluid and convincing, I'm almost concerned Disney will launch a copyright strike! Haha.seriously though if that actually happens my rage will reach the heavensThe occasional specific nods to certain elements of that ""golden age"" of animation always make me smile. And the difficulty, while unforgiving, still gives you a good sense of challenge and subsequent satisfaction.After getting settled into the game, I can easily and honestly say it perfectly blends run-and-gun-style platforming with that relentlessly merciless and annoying yet oh-so-satisfyingly challenging difficulty. I am having an absolute BLAST with this game. Even when I get mad after dying after getting really far in a level or boss, I still do it with a shameless child-like giggle. This game is, on all points,FUN AS HELL. It's something unique that has sprung up out of a lot of stuff that hasn't interested me lately, save a few indie games. So far this year has already churned out a few indie games that have become instant favorites for me. This one has already climbed to my top 10 games for the year AT LEAST.That being said, I will list my few criticisms for the game:1. The difficulty is often so severe at times that I only have 0.5-3 seconds to truly appreciate much of the art. (And as a result I can get distracted and die.) I get the occasional breaks every now and then to relax a little, but a lot of the amazing artistic achievements run right past my vision because I'm focused so much on not getting hit or dying. (Although with the boss areas I would guess this one's more my fault since I always choose regular difficulty, and have never ventured to pick simple.)2. This one's more a personal nitpick, but I wish there was a little bit of dialogue for the bosses, to give them a little more personality, but there's still enough to go around to make me very interested in them.3.WHY DOESN'T THIS HAVE MORE ATTENTION THAN IT ALREADY DOES?As a digital artist, I will be churning out some personal fanart for this game soon. It deserves that much attention.I cannot recommend this game enough. Just buy the game. If you don't like it? Make sure you decide that before racking up 2 hours playtime, as the refund policy states.11/10 would mash my controller again."

76561198044969984,Recommended,268910,35415457,Posted: 2 October,all,Momo,"This review is reposted from my article here:https://cultureofgaming.com/cuphead-review/Cuphead is the largely anticipated run and gun side-scrolling platformer inspired by 1930’s cartoons. Developed by Studio MDHR. The story begins after Cuphead and Mugman lose their souls to the devil. The pair must fight through Inkwell Island’s series of villains in order to retrieve what was taken from them. Prepare for intense battle against sinister flowers, sentient hot dogs, and gangster frogs as you trudge your way through one of the most magical journeys in video game history.Cuphead’s Gambling AddictionAfter a winning streak at the casino, Cuphead and Mugman risk their souls in a bet against The Devil. Unfortunately, they lose. As The Devil takes their souls away, the two beg for a way to get them back. The Devil tells them that if they take the souls of every one of his underlings, he’ll return the two their essence.Cuphead doesn’t spend much time expanding its story. There’s very little dialogue, and the game says everything it needs to through the visuals and music. Hell, the menu music itself is a synopsis of the story. I adore this design, as our time isn’t wasted on long cutscenes or conversations. Everything you need to know is in the presentation. In relation to this, I can’t help but think that the game begs for its visuals to be properly analyzed.Satisfying DifficultyCuphead has you dodging bullet-hell, constantly swapping abilities, exploring the small overworld, and trying to rush your way to the end of a stage without dying. It’s incredibly tough, but nothing compares to the feeling of finally hearing “KNOCKOUT” after being stuck on a boss for an hour. It’s another one of those brutally hard games, but it’s one that feels fair at all times. Very rarely does the game just screw you over, it’s usually the player that made the mistake.Additionally, slowly figuring out how a boss functions, and being able to defeat them without getting hit is so satisfying. Especially when you were only able to get 25% through on your previous attempts. This is the main idea of Cuphead. You have to learn everything about who you’re fighting, or it’ll be impossible to proceed.In general, the game is fluid and easy to pick up. Never have the bindings felt clunky, and never has the game itself felt hard to control. Even if someone doesn’t like the controls, Cuphead allows you to completely remap them, even on the Xbox One.Porkrind’s ShopThe game has a shop, and each item has helped me in some way. Even though some seem more useful than others, they’re equally practical when it comes to defeating certain bosses. These items can be equipped to your character, and you have four equip slots for the different types. First, there are your two bullets slots, which you can quickly shift between in battle. Then you have your super moves, which can either unleash a devastating beam, summon a powerful minion, or make you invincible for a short time.You also have charms, which are passive bonuses that can be game changing if used correctly. These go from giving you extra health to being able to dash without taking damage. You have to mix and match a lot of these in order to make your experience less painful. There was a boss which had beaten me countless times and I was on the verge of rage-quitting, but once I changed my charm, I beat him in a few tries.Astounding CreativityCuphead prides itself on creativity, which isn’t only evident in its soundtrack and artwork, but in the game design too. Every enemy looks great, every theme sounds wonderful, and every boss is a mix of threatening and beautifully designed. However, what’s really surprising is how much the game hates repetition. It tries making every encounter as fresh as possible. You have to adapt to each situation, and the game wants you to try and figure out what different abilities work on which areas. Perhaps it’s simply because I am bad, but it typically took me 25 or so tries before I could even start getting used to how a boss works, and that number is a generous underestimate.If you enter a new stage, you will never see the same assets or enemies that were used in previous stages. This is one of the amazing things about Cuphead, not only does it hate repetition, it despises it. It refuses to recycle what it has already shown to the player, besides from only a couple of things. There are so few, that I can actually name them. There are about three mausoleums throughout the game, and all three of these function in the same way, even if they usually have a new enemy type.However, as a result of this hatred of repetition, the game length certainly suffers. In terms of content, it’s not a very long game. What makes it so long is how often you’ll get stuck on the bosses, but if you were able to beat every boss and every stage on your first try, you could probably finish Cuphead in an hour. Although this may seem like a bad thing, it’s more of a positive. No repetition means the game never gets old, and it never stops surprising you with its creativity. Even if the game is shorter because of this, it’s a trade I’d happily accept any day.The OverworldThere’s a tiny overworld which is where you decide where you go next, but there isn’t an emphasis on this mechanic. There are a few secrets and extra coins you can get by looking around and talking to citizens, but besides from that, there’s not much to it. It’s certainly cute, and it’s a relaxing break from the hell you go through fighting bosses, but if it was a more prominent mechanic, it could’ve distracted from the overall pacing of the game.A Masterful 1930’s CartoonEven though Cuphead’s gameplay turned out to be fantastic, what really drew so much attention to it was the visuals. This game does something no other has. It has managed to perfectly replicate what a cartoon in the 1930’s felt like, sounded like, and looked like. It’s even more impressive considering that the animation, music, and effects were made in the same ways they were made in the 1930’s. The bosses you’re fighting might dance to the funky music playing, your character will remove the cup from his head and bring it up for toast, and every frame you’re presented with has been expertly crafted to be magical.Ridiculous Load TimeOn the Xbox One, Cuphead forces you to wait 20-30 seconds in a loading screen. This may not seem like a long time, but it certainly is considering how fast-paced the game is meant to be. What makes it worse is that even the loading symbol lags around. After buying Cuphead on PC, I noticed that the loading screen only takes a few seconds, and the symbol doesn’t lag around either. I’m not sure what happened that has made the Xbox One version load so slowly, but it’s annoying.Co-OpI originally played through the game by myself on Xbox One, then I purchased the game on PC to play it with a friend. These two experiences were wildly different. Single player is intense, scary, and frustrating as hell. Multiplayer is simply hilarious, wild, and chaotic. Not many games have done this to me, where I feel like just adding an extra player changes everything. In this sense, choosing how you play is very important. Thankfully, both of my experiences were fantastic, as the dark loneliness of frustration and intensity is on par with the lovely sensation of hilarity and fun. In the end, it’s up to you how you experience it as either way is phenomenal.ConclusionEvery boss feels like a grand finale, and each encounter is a treacherous mountain the player needs to climb. Cuphead personifies the pure dedication of a new developer to create something no one has seen before, and it’s a wild success. It has personally provided me with one of the most breathtaking journeys I’ve ever been on, and I cannot wait to see what else Studio MDHR has to show us."

It's money well spent."

,Recommended,268910,35504596,Posted: 5 October,all,AvatarlessHope,"Without a doubt one of the more fun games I have played this year.The artistic style is unique, pulling back to the 1930s era. Boss battles are varied, and get progressively harder as the game continues, as you would expect. The game punishes lack of precision, similar to the Contra games of old.Boss Rush games are not nearly as wide-spread as they should be, but this is definitely a breathe of fresh air. There is a single option of reprieve available for those not looking for excessive punishment. All boss fights come with 2 difficulty levels, which allows for almost everyone with some patience to be able to enjoy the game.For $20 at release, without a doubt on my most recommended list."
,Recommended,268910,35485583,Posted: 4 October,all,Quasar ULAS,"The creators of cuphead are determined to make you suffer as much playing the game as they did creating it.....or at least make you work as hard!Hand crafted, eyecatching 1930s cartoon visuals and character designs sets cuphead apart from the pack. Enough so to merit a play through alone! However the simple to learn hard to master difficulty will halt a lot of players right off the bat. Even with the somewhat popular resurgence in brutal game difficulties. Im not ashamed to admit (as a rusty/inexperienced platformer player) even the first stage kicked my butt back to the 30s!The game it's self isn't litered with stages as you'll spend more time on a handful at once. learning to master enemy telegraphs, move sets and multiple phases. The game length is defenitly derived from the harsh difficulty that doesnt spike but sets the bar at a firm neck height from the word go, or as phrased ""you're up"".  without it would be a few hours at most for the average gamer content wise. The difficulty drawing ample time in substitution to where more time consuming work on extra stages would take. This isn't to far of feild though as the games it draws inspiration from, (contra, metal slug) are also known for legendary old school difficulty. Keeping the games retro charms not just to sound and visuals but gameplay wise as well.While the controls are simple they handle well and feel responsive to player input making player death often feel justified.  Comparison to the dark souls franchise is fitting for these reasons as you'll also be collecting multiple boss souls to beat the game. A major difference here being there is no option to grind your way out of a hard situation. Only persistance reflex and learning the various attack patterns will ensure your survival. This all being paired with little wiggle room for error courtesy of the old skool 3 live system. Even with this said not every death feels entierly fair and may result in uncontrolable profanity.The overarching hubworld conects the levels well enough and the ability to roam from one boss fight to another at will removes the frustration of completing a stage before every boss attempt. This sadly also works as a doubble edged sword as it gives little breathing room to players after fights to enjoy the acomplishment and progress for victory as another lies imediately around the corner. subsiquently this diminishes player satisfaction with only world progress payouts from fights. New powers are not given as rewards for the boss fights themselves you will not get a chance to enjoy new found strength after each fight. It's hard to feel the entire journey of cuphead in this regaurd, and time in an expanded if somewhat inconcievable cuphead verse would set it leagues apart, with more room for the game to breath and curve in difficulty.What Cuphead sets out to achive it hits the mark in all the right places. The emulation of classic animation and sound design are top notch and exceptional detail has been taken to ensure some highly creative boss designs. High praise from the eye of a fellow cartoonist! (a somewhat amature one by comparison!)Im glad to be alive in a time where games with unique and intersting approaches are breaking through to poular culture and the fact something this cool even exsits at all! Even when the difficulty is overshading the artwork cuphead is really quite a landmark. Inovation to push the boundary further and draw interest to the experimental side of games is a healthy by product to be left in its wake.Even if i never beat the game cuphead has sprung new life into an often overlooked asthetic approach that is still as timless as it was in the age of classic cartoonsIMPORTANTas a standalone point the game has crashed and deleted my save files multiple times towards the start now halfway through the game. bringing this review close to becoming negative. it's very hard to recomend what is esentially a broken game(I have not yet completed the game at time of reviewing,may be updated upon completion)"

76561198346466004,Recommended,268910,35485372,Posted: 4 October,all,Depressed Mouse,"Cuphead is an exciting difficult side-scroller game it has a unique 1930s cartoon style a aesthetic I've admired for a while now. And to finally see a video game with it just makes me so happy as I said before the game is very hard you will find you will die a lot it should be called cupsouls you will rage quit a lot but then 20 mins later going I need to beat that boss. Also playing with a mate might be better as playing by yourself is a death sentence. The story is above average the game is more about gameplay than a story but the story is still decent. The story is about two young cup boys who are cared by a wise old kettle one day they go adventuring too far from home and they go into the devils casino even after the kettle said not to they go on a winning streak and the devil makes a deal with them if they roll anything other than snake eyes on their next role they have to give u their souls if they don't roll snake eyes get to keep the casino and its riches cup heads brother warns him not too but he does it anyway and he rolls snake eyes they plead with the devil and they come up with a new contract saying the brothers have to collect the souls of his ""runaway debtors "" it is then up to you to collect their souls for the devil I would also recommend using a Xbox one controller the mouse and keyboard make it beyond hard to play even though it was already extremely difficultGraphics: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10CO-OP:10/10story: 6/10music: 10/10overall:10/10in conclusion cuphead is a must buy game with one of the best unique graphics ive seen on a video game and I was a sucker for 1930s cartoons even before this game came out so I might be a bit bias but the other reviews speak for itself cuphead is just amazing and so much fun and you would expect this game to e full priced $60USD/$100AUD dollar game  too but its only $20 USD and about $29.95 AUD and sorry for any mistakes this review was well thought out but written in a rush lmao BUY THE GAME !"

,Recommended,268910,35524908,Posted: 6 October,all,Sir Lina,"A bit of backstory for me before i give my two cents, I play alot of Contra and Super C on my NES, it's a ritual for me to play them once a month. You might wonder what the hell is the point of me telling you this, and why the hell don't i enter the twenty first century and play something new? Well to answer the latter ""I'm writing a review for Cuphead..."" Anyway, the point of me telling you that i play those two old (GREAT) games is that I really enjoy sidescrollers like these games, and that may be a bit of a bias.Anyway, Cuphead is an well put-together game, not just in the artistic sense, (snerk, I almost put autistic), but the controls are very responsive, framerate is nice and crisp, and music is smooth, jazzy and very very upbeat. I feel like I should be wearing a fedora (not a trilby) and askin' Louie behind the counter to give me a scotch while i check out the dame who's totally not interested in me on stage while Mugsy Malone and the Skedaddle Twins get ready to shoot up the bar with their Thompsons as I pull out my Colt and get ready to take out the trash.The largest draw for me was the art style, which is  IN-FERKING-CREDIBLE. It is like playing a cartoon. The animation is extremely smooth, colorful, and just outright a hoot to watch. If you like a game that wows you on a visual level, this might be your bag.I won't go intro controls as it is a 2-d sidescroller and should not require me to give you a dissertation on it. Game is pretty much either stages where you move to the end of a stage, or boss battles. You can get different weapons in game, and get certain powerups which change your abilities. Keeps the game pretty fresh. I do want to say that the game is fairly balanced. What I mean by that is (if you have played Contra this may resonate with you) the spreader in this game is not OP. You generally don't want to stick with one weapon type in this game, and will need (in many cases) to use multiple weapons.The thing that may dissuade some people is that the game is not a walk in the park. As an old man who's been playing games since he was 5, this game was challenging but not something I would call hard. That may seem to contradict itself, so let me briefly explain.  This game is not the type where you can enter a boss fight and beat it in one go (generally), you've got to learn patterns and really think about your next move. (I'm looking at you Bee lady). So if you die alot, don't beat yourself up about it.TL;DR Good game, great music, runs well. NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE game, worth the money, takes actual EFFORT and SKILL to play (looking at you rest of gaming industry), and nice art style. I highly recommend this game if you need a contra fix.[\b]Thanks for reading, and please research more before you buy. Support these guys, they have talent and I'd like to see what else they can do. They are what the game industry needs..not the crap we've had for the last ~10 years. I'm looking at you DLC and EA..and Capcom....and Bioware....and Bethesda......er...perhaps I've said too much....."

The pricetag is worth the art and music alone, the entire game is beautiful. It's not the hardest game in the world but it is definitely quite difficult. You will be dying and retrying a lot, learning the boss mechanics more and more each time, improving slightly with every effort and seeing your little Cuphead figure get further and further along the line representing a boss's health shown to you upon your death.Controls are tight and responsive. When you get hit, it's your fault and you can see why. Though you will still be mad. That's all a part of the fun.It is hard. Very hard, but doable.

,Recommended,268910,35528697,Posted: 6 October,all,Jebediah Badabucci,"So, it's hard to write an unbiased review for this game since I was looking forward to it for a while, but I will definitely try. Visually, it's beautiful. The creaters wanted to go for a 1930s-esque cartoon designed, and I think they did amazingly in that aspect. The characters, the villains, and the bosses all look fantastic. The backgrounds for each level are also intricate. The music is also perfect. I could not imagine something better than what they have created. The old-school jazz aids in setting the 1930s scene as well. In terms of gameplay, the creators definitely made the game as difficult as they were aiming to. Though each level is simplistic in its design, mastering them takes time. You learn the patterns that makes victory all the more sweet when it is achieved. The one qualm I have (if it even counts as one) is that for the boss fights, there is not too much of an effect when you hit the boss. This makes it difficult when using a low-range weapon to know if you are indeed doing damage. However, this too aids in the difficulty factor that this game is known for.Overall, this is a game that is definitely worth trying. I think it is very worth the 20 dollars that it costs since it will provides hours of fun. The co-op feature is also great. I have had no issues with it and appreciate how the difficulty seems to increase when adding another player. I think it is a game that is more enjoyable when playing with another person, but it is great on your own as well. I would give this game a solid 9/10 and would dare say that it is one of the best games to come out this year. I greatly look forward to what the developers plan on doing in the future."

It takes on refined aspects of old contra, metal slug, and megaman style games and does a good job polishing them to provide a satisfying and challenging experience.Cuphead has a great focus, which is on boss battles and phases, and encourages the player to not take 3 hits in encounters that last between 1 and 2 minutes. Cuphead is pretty consistent in its challenge, and offers a great variety of engagements that vary in style and difficulty throughout the campaign.The production value of the game is also absolutely worth mentioning and admiring. Most people will be drawn to this game by the aesthetic, and the efforts of the team to create catchy swing tracks and vibrant animations / backgrounds for everything in the game was tremendously worth it.Cuphead does a great and charming job of providing a fantastic aesthetic that makes you curious, and engaging you with challenging and varied gameplay.

Very difficult as many people have already stated but that in itself is one of the best features there is nothing more rewarding then spending over 30 mins trying to kill one boss learning his patterns and then finally defeating him you feel a great sense of accomplishment, that being said it's not Touhou lunatic hard but the trade off in that retrospect is the amazing soundtrack, animation, and atmoshpere the game provides highly recommended."

76561198134832105,Recommended,268910,35534057,Posted: 6 October,all,Petesneak,I just got this game and it is well worth the 20 bucks. You are getting a game that has a lot of thought and effort put into including original jazz compositions from a professional composer and very smooth and silly animation for 20 bucks. Better quality than most games made by big game companies.

,Recommended,268910,35533950,Posted: 6 October,all,ExpressNature,Don't ever hesitate to buy - Worth the money! We are back to the 1930's! More than Contra!
,Recommended,268910,35533951,Posted: 6 October,all,Jaxx54,"The atmosphere within the game perfectly executes the 1930 jazzy and uptight style. It leaves you bobbing with the rythem of the characters, as well as the soundtrack itself. Unforgiving bosses, meaningful story, and megaman-esque gameplay will keep you playing for hours upon hours in hopes of completing the game! That is until you see there is a secret third difficulty, which is where the fun really begins."

Took less than 4 hours for me to beat it and I have no intention of 100%ing the game, mostly because I'd have to deal with that ♥♥♥♥ING robot again"
