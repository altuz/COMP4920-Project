I want to make it very clear I have played only enough to make sure that it worked on my old computer. That was in the first half of last year.I waited to start a playthrough of the game until the update adding those major systems was released, as in my estimation the procedural bosses and magic system were a huge part of this procedural game. I have not started a playthrough yet, as these features have not been released to Steam's early access players yet and are only available to certain community individuals. (I am unclear as to which individuals were granted access; it is my understanding that there is a separate community elsewhere, started earlier, that has some sort of EARLY early access).Communication with the Steam community is filtered through a small group of elite testers / community members that are also the only ones with access to the current beta. I purchased the game with the understanding that I'd have early access to the content that is published as being worked on, but instead it is only available for private testing. Please do not mistake the large number of news posts listed as being updates that have been made to the version on Steam.According to the folks that are in communication with the developer, as soon as those with access to the beta have finished testing it, we'll have access to the stuff they've already tested. I have no reason to doubt this.I can not recommend this game as an early access purchase because it is not clear to purchasers that content added to the beta will not be made available to all early access purchasers. Based on Steam's ""Yes / No"" recommendation system, I must mark it as a ""No."" I firmly believe this game will be worth purchasing in its final version, but I do not recommend purchasing this as an early access title, due to the limited beta access given with purchase."

76561198088899050,Not Recommended,268930,26154710,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,ClawlessVictory,"I read a description of the game and instantly loved the idea, it sounded like the game I always wanted to play.  After reading up a bit more and viewing a few posts on the official forums, the developer's heart seemed to really be into it.  So, knowing that it was in EA, I bit the bullet and dove in hoping for the best.In it's current state, the game is very, very bare-bones and every aspect of it is an ugly mess to put it bluntly.  Now, it's possible the graphics and art could grow on me with time, I'm very forgiving in this regard and I prefer a minimalist approach over a stellar budget with all flash, no substance.  The problem is, I don't see much substance here yet.  There are only a handful of enemies to fight, and fighting consists of clicking until either the enemy dies, or you die.  Sure, there are supposedly a variety of spells, but playing the permadeath mode, I only ever acquired the beginning heal spell before I got bored with the paltry content.  Stats are all very simplistic and it seems like there might not be much room to grow, but I'm hoping it's possible.There are some cool ideas here like having an infinite world to explore, claiming new sites that other players can find and explore, but of the dozen or so different dungeons I've seen, they're nothing special at all and if you've seen one, you've seen them all.  Very little variety, but hopefully more will be added in the future.I normally wouldn't review a game in this state, but at the glacial pace it's being developed, I find it very hard to believe this game will ever deliver what it promises.  It's my fault for not doing more research before buying and I definitely regret this purchase.  I recommend putting it on your wishlist and stearing clear of a purchase until more progress is made.  MUCH more progress."

If you have a valid argument against what I say here, leave it in the comments. When you blindly mark reviews down it discredits reviews that would have otherwised helped somebody.There was a TON of potential in this game, but the creator's vision is flawed. I'm walking through a town and I can't even see the wall at the end of an alleyway because the render distance is so small. They've said it needs to be that way in order to do this and that, but it really just ruins the immersion. They sacrificed many potential gameplay options in order to pay ""homage to the 90s era FPRPGs.""Older RPGs are great. They have depth and variety, unlike the current games that pander to the lowest common denominator. The creators should have taken these great old things(which they did), and make a game with a current engine that could also support enhanced gameplay.Long story short, there have been improvements and detriments to gaming, and I thought this game was going to take the great parts of both eras and make a game as deep as they used to be while improving by way of using modern technology.btw- Most of the things they say they are missing because the game is ""a homage,"" are actually missing because their engine(which runs poorly because they chose a larger world over improved gameplay) can't handle it. Or because they simply won't put in the time to implement them(and keep in mind this game got like 500+% of the funding they originally asked for, so that is an unacceptable excuse).I wanted to like this very badly, but I just can't. If you want to play a game that plays and feels like it's from decades ago, get an actual one from decades ago(legitamate advice, those games are great). This (sometimes even intentionally)fails to improve on those ones, so there is no point in spending your money on it. This could have been great, had they put more effort into mixing in some modern technology and ideas."

Malevolence has the feel of those games but it really isn't one of those games.  Ultimately, for me at least, the core being of Malevolence is that it is infinite and has an infinite number of ways to kill you.  In almost all cases I abhor scaling in RPG's but it works for Malevolence- in fact there is really no other way it could work that I can think of.I heartily recommend this game for anyone who relishes a challenge that could potentially never end.  I really, really like this game despite some of the bugs that exist now (none of them show stopping for me).  Alex has done a tremendous job and continues to develop and support a labor of love.This is not a 'AAA' title and that is for the best.  So if you are looking for infinite Oblivion/Skyrim this is not it.  Malevolence is it's own beast and doesn't make any allusions to being something it is not.Prost!"

It is not a dungeon crawler but instead it is a game where you really have to pick your battles (wisely at that). I suggest this game to anyone who has the patience to think about their actions ahead of time. As a side note keep an eye on the jewels on the bottom they are very important which I had not know until I watched a video for beginners. Very fun game!

That was around 2 years ago and I gotta say that this game has made incredible progress in that time. The game is in a finished beta state, fully playable and totally infinitely huge, actually beyond huge, there is no limit. There are unlimited locations to explore, no level cap, I cannot express how much I really enjoy this game. And to think it was thought up and created by one man, with help from a select bunch of testers. The game is amazing and definately worth the money, if in doubt try the demo first. Now this isnt graphically superior, or story rich, but it is definately engaging and will keep one playing a lifetime if they wish. Currently I just bought the Steam version of the game and it displays something like 12 hours played, but that is in 2 days. I have easilly spent 200+ hours since my initial purchace and I am not ever bored, level up, re-gear, go fight more mobs. There is a difficulty scaling and certain dungeons are just more difficult than others, too tough? Go fight a different place. There is no lack of dungeons.

I think this game has alot of potential.  I didn't realize that you would start at pretty much ground zero in each new dungeon you go into.  I like to grind it's a way to veg out, You can constantly improve your character, but it seems like as soon as you finish one dungeon and are slaughtering everything the next one kills you with ease.  I like to progress my character in game I want a powerful character not one constantly getting beat up by goblins.  I'll recommend it just for the time I've played it."

Pick a direction and run, you can run forever, just dodging the occasionally tree or rock, trust me, there are no borders or invisible walls in this world!- You can play a game of dice or get drunk in the local tavern, but trust me, save first, specially if you play Permadeath!

Combat is not a click click swing weapon as fast as you can. The game does not work like that. This game is HARD and i do mean it you will die a lot but if you can step back and think of your next move when to cast a spell or when to use a potion and or when to run you will get a lot of of  this.Graphics take a wee bit of getting used to and the limited tiles for dungeons just now do make them a bit samey but it is the gamepay this game shines and this game does have a lot to come which can only enhance a great game.Also of note is the music which sets the mood for the game.For old school rpg players this is well worth the time and money. It wont be for the action rpg players this is not what this game is about but if you do like to explore an endless world and being the first to discover places then this is for you.

Even at this early stage, the game is incredibly fun.  It's a first-person roguelike set in an effectively infinite procedurally generated world.  Although the world is not regenerated every time you play, the fact is that the size of the world means that you'll never run out of unique lands and dugneons to explore.  Gameplay is actually relatively simple.  But because there's no tutorial, and a lot is left to the player to figure out for himself, it can be frustrating until some things 'click'.The game doesn't have any true classes, but you'll differentiate yourself based on how you kill monsters, and the spells that you cast,  the traps that you disarm, as well as, by your gear.At this stage, the game only has a few different kinds of monsters, a few different kinds of quests, 2 kinds of dungeon themes a couple of minigames (one for removing traps, another for gambling at the tavern) and a number of different facilities in towns you'll visit (including shops, temples, a fighters guild, mages guild and Thieve's guild and two different kinds of fast transports.In spite of the incomplete nature of the game, and a few bugs (including some stability issues), the game is very fun to play.  I find myself wanting to just see if I can get to the next level, clear out al of the monsters on my current dungeon floor, or kill just one more goblin or imp in order to complete a quest.  So I do recommend it.  But keep in mind (as I said) there are issues.Update as of August 2016:I'm not going to change this to a negative review, since what I wrote earlier still is the case. That said, let me tell you that dev has not been releasing updates to the general audience -- only to his limited membership of beta testers.  We've been assured that work is still being done, but the occasional assurance of that is the only evidence.My first instinct in going over my former review was to change it to a negative. But I honestly had a positive reaction to the game back then, so it would be dishonest of me to change my review now. But lets just say that all of the problems the game has still exist, and its biggest problem (Besides not much variety to the game) is that its basic stat system is screwy and works in an anti-intuitive and annoying way, and I'm really worried that promised changes to the magic system, instead of relying on a more rational stats system, will simply be the dev doubling down on the oddball system that is already there. But speculation like that is all a person like me, not part of the devs inner circle can do.When will this be more than what it is? God only knows. Maybe never.So yeah, I'm still giving the game a good review, but as time continues to passs, I've become more and more skeptical that this will ever live up to its potential."

,Recommended,268930,11850939,"Posted: 24 August, 2014",all,Mr Muscle,"Fantastic 90s style RPG with some incredibly immersive dungeon crawling.First of all, the game is still under development, and as such it isn't very well optimised. I'd ONLY recommend getting the game if you have a pretty good gaming PC.Graphics: Not state of the art by any means, but stay true to what exactly the developers are trying to achieve with this game.For people with older/less expensive PCs there is a low detail mode, which I can't say I really like the look of, but at least it's there.Sound: Fantastic music; especially the piece in the loading screens while waiting to enter towns. The sound effects also stay true to the feel of the game and sound similar to what you'd expect in the 90s. You'll hear monsters grunt and groan as you make your way through dungeons and it really adds to the atmposhere of the dungeons.Gameplay: Turn based. Each map is marked by a squared grid. Each movement uses a turn. Pretty simplistic, and really easy to pick up and play.Dungeons: By far the best part of the game; this is what the game is all about after all. The dungeons are dark and eerie, requiring a lit torch to see where you're going. They range from small narrow corridors with many twists and turns to great halls filled with pillars. The dungeons of Ahkranox are also incredibly dangerous. You're never too far from some sort of monster, or even worse, a trap!Yes, traps play a big part in the dungeons. They range from explosion and poison traps to boulders and spikes, and if you're not careful, they just might be what kills you. When a trap is in your vicinity, your purple gem will glow and you can search by clicking in front of you and attempt to disarm it.Monsters also require some thought as to how you'll approach them. You'll hear their groans and when you get close your green gem will glow. Whilst combat is simple, it still requires some thought. You know the monster is there, but can't always see whether it's only a little imp or a man stomping ogre.Dungeons also have secret passages which are indicated by your red gem glowing. You just simply click the correct wall and it opens up.Loot: There is tons of loot in this game. From new weapons to books to potions to troll pubes. (or something like that)Loot can be found both outside dungeons and inside. It can be obtained from barrels, chests, crates, monsters, urns, tables, and so on. As for monsters, you'll often debate whether or not the loot is worth the risk.Difficulty: Malevolence is an incredibly difficult game overall. However, it is only really as difficult as you make it for yourself.Everything comes down to being prepared, forward thinking, being careful and knowing when you're beaten. You really are your own worst enemy in this game.Permadeath and Leaderboards: By selecting permadeath, your save data is deleted when you die. (obviously) But when you play a permadeath character, there's a chance that if you can survive long enough to reach a certain level, that you'll make the leaderboards.Land Claiming: Any time you find a new area you can hit f11 and see who who discovered the area first, or claim any already unclaimed land. The world is infinite, so there's always a chance that you can put your own name to something.In short: If you're looking for an immersive, challenging dungeon crawler with a retro feel, this is it. It's already fantastic to play and can only get better with time. :)"

However, expect...- Badly scaled monsters, due to monster difficulty being decided by your current area and your level rather than spawn location (you can kill monsters by running back to outside the town gates and then just blocking all monster hits)- Long load times (There's a music jingle that plays if you enter a town... only once it actually ends you can play again... the jingle is about 30 seconds long, I think)- More loading (overworld is divided into 20x20 grid sections. Or 25x25. Whenever you enter a new section... the game has to load. So when you're travelling from A to B, or just exploring, you'll constantly be pulled out of your immersion)- Bad graphics (""you might have to tweak them to get a good result"" = don't buy unless your monitor's native resolution is 1024x768 or 1440x900 - because otherwise, game will look bad. Especially trees.)- Bad viewrange (~20 tiles, or about 100 meters). You know how there's towers and castles in this game? Yeah, well, you can 't see them until they're in a section next to your section. Meaning that if a castle takes up most of a section, you can't see it until you're 25-30 tiles away from it (about 125 meters). So when you cross a section border, POOF castle.- NO in-game tutorial. There's one on the menu, but it's easily missed as it's at the bottom of the screen, far away from ""continue game"" and ""new game"". What do the gems mean? You don't know, nobody tells you and without knowing that you will DIE. Red = secret area, green = monster, purple = ""important object"". Which is a town, a dungeon, or a trap. Oh yeah. To exit a dungeon, step off the exit tile, look at it from an adjacent tile, AND CLICK THE LADDER/TRAPDOOR. Again, this had to be looked up online, after I fled from a monster, and found out that I'd easily have been able to escape, but because I was now pinned to the exit tile, I couldn't. Because my character can't stick his arms straight up to pull a ladder down.In short:- You don't get much information- The game is hard because you don't get much information, not because of there actually being things you have to overcome.However, if you don't find the above listed issues a problem, then this could be a game for you. Because of the game does deliver on the things it promises."

However there are things that are deeper here and things that are more shallow. The deepness lies in the vastness of the world. There are literally thousands of dungeons in this world. The shallowness is the lack of creature variety and no actual RPG interaction. But this is More in line with games like Eye of the Beholder, Legends of Grimrock, Fall of the Dungeon Gaurdians and the always ephereal grimoire. The difference is it is free roam. Now that can be a good or a bad thing. Free Roam is great but you might wonder into a tomb where you are seriuosly out matched. You play as a single character, which I usually don't like in an RPG, (combat rpg or real rpg) and take various quest to gain prestige, power, and ability to purchase greater goodies. The quest are shallow, really just go find this dungeon, which is not easy in this vast world, kill certain amount of x creatures or the big bad boss. Not anything that hasn't been done a zillion times. But it is done differently than the games of old. Of course you still attack monsters wth a few different attacks, weapons, or skills but the magic system is based on Gems. Power gems have different levels and different colored gems are for different spells....fire, frost, healing, slowing...you know the deal.  You also have two Gems on your HUD. Now these are warning gems and have nothing to do with the spells. One gem lights up when monsters are near, simulating what would be sound and smell, the other lights up because of your dungeon intuition, something is near...could be treasure...yay! or it could be a trap...booo! I need to mention now there are ways to check for traps, and you better do it cause these aint the prick your finger kinda traps. These traps were meant to kill aspiring heroes.......   So some specifics....Visuals...uhmm..no, not its strong pointsound and music....decent no better.automapping in dungeons...yes praise be...you need itsecrets areas...checkvastness...uncomprehendable reallygameplay...repetitive but fun, or frustrating depending on how your adventure is going.Oh, you know how in some games you can run back to the entrance and escape disaster? This may or may not work here as monsters will follow you outside. And I already said it was a blobber so one increment at a time movements. There are obstacles out side and the creatures very often cut you off ruining your day.Lots of treasure and stuff? nope. I forgot to mention this is more a 3-d rogue like. Its designed to be tough.Now I kow none of these description are particularly wowing so you may ask why I recommend this game?Its one of those games you play to give your mind a break. Couple hours here. Couple hours there.In small chunks it will hold your interest.Now I wont call it relaxing completely because there are plenty of ""Oh Crap!"" moments you experience.Who might like this game? Old school rpg'ers. Casual adventurers, gamers that love step rpg's.Who will not like this game? Console converts, graphics junkies and people who hate to have their avatars die.You will die my friends...oh but how you will die.Oh one last thing. This game has been in development for a LONG time. Not 23 years Grimoire long but still a long time.The difference between those two games is that this is an entirely finished game. Why early access? The dev is always updating,albeit very slowly, unlike the afore mentioned game that has not had anything more than ademo released since 2004.Cheers."
,Not Recommended,268930,34705616,Posted: 3 September,all,Mistress of Boredom,"I really couldn't get into this game. I really really tried. I know this is going to be unfair because it is listed as 'early access' but it's been in early access for 3 years and feels really barebone to me. These are all my opinions but I could not play past 1.5 hours because I got REALLY bored. In fact, the screenshots really make the game seem cooler than it really is because the world and moving around in the world was uninteresting. I can't put into words why but I did not feel really compelled to explore. When I died I did not really feel compelled to jump back into it and try exploring elsewhere.Maybe my expectations were wrong and my judgement is unreasonable as a result of it. However I did not like the game for my opinions stated above so that's that."

Then convert to pints of blood,sweat, and tears, cause the only being that has shed more of that than this dev has poured into this game...... is you when you walk over that first spike trap!Controls are standard fare, done well. And the new magic system is eagerly awaited. Can't wait for the polish run!2,000,000 Pints/Spike Trap. SEVERELY recommended!"

First of all, the loadings takes a ethernity. Second, the character stats are very ambiguous. Thrid. The insta kill traps + ethernal loadings turns some quests very annoying. Mainly if you have to clear a dungeon and there are few enemies left in dungeon. All dungeons fells like the same in terms of design, but there are few first person RPG's. This is why i recommend the game. M&M X Legacy still worst,"

While playable, certainly not worth the asking price.*EDIT*Well there is a suprise. Big update. Lots of fixes, and new magic system with consistant developer feedback and numerous bug fixes. Changing my review to a thumbs up. Worth getting....I'd still wait until release however."

This is still decidedly pre-alpha material, and by the looks of it, will unlikely offer as many features / polish / FUN as most FREE roguelikes. Not to say this couldn't be extremely fun one day - but it will never be worth 20 bucks."
