It's deep fun, gorey hack 'n' slasher, with a style that Ska studio fine crafted themselves with a good OSTDetailed Verison: I first played the Dishwasher series on Xbox Live Arcade, the style was something that I haven't seen when I was younger, playing Dead Samurai was and still to this date great and I hope Ska studio brings that to Steam as well one day. With Vampire Smile, you can play as The Dishwasher as well but you can play as a new character called Yuki. (I won't go into spoiler country) I played this on hardest setting as the start since I played it on XBL and it's a huge jump, enemies rush more, hitboxes are kinda weird when you moving around all super fast like but it's since a wonderful feeling when you clear a room with either full health or nearly dead. Being able to nonstop airjuggles is great when you get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and you send someone up in the air nonstop. If you got ten bucks (or whatever how much it is once the summer sale starts) PICK. THIS. UP. You won't be disappointed."

I feel in love with the original The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai, and this game is one of those extrememly rare examples of stellar sequels that somehow manage to keep all that made the original great while adding to it. Paint the grimy, bleak and dreary environments in red cyborg guts with a wide variety of weapons, all the while feeling like an absolute badass as you weave between waves of creative enemies. There's a bit of exploration, rewarded by finding helpful hidden items, or keys to progress, and loads of great bossfights interspersed throughout.The real gem / takeaway from the game is something hard to describe without playing it - it's the ""feel"" of it. Dark and brooding atmosphere, bottomless buckets of gore, and a stellar soundtrack all combine to make a unique game out of a plain genre. I don't even really like hack-n'-slash games.The music adds a lot - so much so that I've been trying in vain for a while now to get Pain Administrator or The Sunken March to play in Salt & Sanctuary when a boss shows up. I had the chance to see Ska Studios a while ago during PAX when they were promoting Charlie Murder, and when I was done sperglording out I had asked about how the music is done. I'm still struggling over how James nonchalantly said ""Garage Band"" - that's insane.Fantastic game from fantastic people! Combat is super-smooth and crisp, finishers gruesome and satisfying. If you're into hack-n'-slash / beat em' ups, this game is pure unadulterated joy. One of my favorite aspects of Vampire Smile (and all Ska Games) is that it's so uniquely their own game. Its everything that makes passionate indie titles so great - I could never play anything like this from anybody else; when just two (!) people create a game, everything in it is from them alone. Everything that makes the game up becomes almost personal in that way, like a vision from them to you.Fantastic / 10 would ride the Dragon hellivator in an endless loop of retries again."

Glorious blood.Story: The story is pretty cool and you can choose your character who gets their own story.METAL!!!: Yeah... look for the amps, play that music. (On a side note the button prompts aren't the best on pc as they kind of mash together at times. Still really good.)This game is only 10 bucks and is well worth it."

I have simply booted the game to test the controls and can confirm that this port is fantastic.  I have been waiting for it to come to PC for years, and couldn't be more excited that it finally has.  Ska Studios has been one of my favorite indie devs since their silly zombies game on 360.I have completed this game 100% on 360, and trust me, when I get the time to spare, I will be doing the same on PC.If you like hack'n'slash, beat'em-up, gory games, this one is perfect.

Finding out this game was recently released on PC after so long was like being in a dream.Through past experience with the game on the Xbox 360, I can assure anyone who is holding off on buying this game that it's worth buying.Reasons for buying:1. Beat em up arcade gameplay.2. Dark storyline.3. Cool weapons you can combo with that change playstyle.4. Upgrades for your character.5. Crazy boss fights.6. Blood and gore.7. Cool artstyle8. Finisher moves that you can use on enemies and bosses.9.

,Recommended,268990,31725353,Posted: 13 May,all,Gefafawhisp,"Was surprised to see one of my all time favourites from the Xbox 360 arcade era appearing on steam. Picked it up straight away and i'm pretty damn happy.Game looks great in 1440p, the PC port is solid and the added definition makes it even easier to pick out the action which would have been one of my criticisms of the original, as the onscreen action can become pretty intense. The little guitar hero style interludes are just as cool as I remember them. The game is also a great Co-op for people that are interested in that aspect.A really fun fighting platformer that never feels like you are just button mashing because of the different abilities available to you that you might consider stringing together for any given situation"
,Recommended,268990,31742141,Posted: 14 May,all,Chickensalad,"One of the best 2D beat em ups ever made.  Think of it like Ninja Gaiden 2 in 2d.  Surviving is all about proper juggling of multiple foes using aerial combos, grabs. guns, and the crowning feature: an infinitly spammable teleport that you can do in any direction, even through the air.  Enemies die quick but attack quickly as well.  It's one of those ""get in the zone"" kind of action games.Basically if you enjoy character action games you'll enjoy this."
76561198046705079,Recommended,268990,31708133,Posted: 12 May,all,Xerclipse,"I've played both the first game Dead Samurai and Vampire Smile on my xbox360. Yes you should get the game.If you want 2D Ninja Gaiden Black or Devil May Cry on crack, you got it. People say its hard and believe them it is at first. Its hard because you can't block and the enemies deal so much of damage. But you can warp all around the stage all you want. Yes you can go wreckless but you shouldn't go for broke all the time.It feels more fluid than Dead Samurai because once you get the arsenal you can just shoot at anytime while using your melee weapons. The finishing moves are nice with the floor/wall bashing and the izuna drop. The combo system is very intuitive.You get to play as two characters, Dishwasher or Yuki. Playing as the Dishwasher was more fun than playing as Yuki but thats my opinion. Yuki is faster and optimal but the Dishwasher is more crazier. The Dishwasher has much more fun and dynamic weapons. Remember when your mother told you not to run around with scissors? Well now is your chance. Just mash up Y X Y X Y X and you are cutting everything in your way. The Dekkentozter is a very unorthodox weapon but it is a very strong weapon. Its because you have to squirt water (which does no damage) and then hit your enemy with the electric thingy (which does SUPER damage).I have not yet tried out coop mode because the 360 build was a bit fuzzy. I hope the steam netcode is much better when I try it. Hit me up if you guys want to play."
,Recommended,268990,31756834,Posted: 14 May,all,Noriaki,"Simply one of the best Indie-games back then and even nowadays!Love Ska Studio's art style and dark atmosphere.The game is a fast paced hack and slay 2D side scroller with lots of gore.For a little Indie-game this game has a surprising amount of combos that are only matched by Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden.There is one negative aspect that bothered me since the original release on the 360:Ska Studio games tend to have some sorts of exploits that make the games very easy in some ways.In Salt and Sanctuary you have the super jump so you could reach areas without finding the air dash rune first.In the original Dishwasher all you had to do was to level up the meat cleavers and spam the triple ""strong"" attack to defeat everything that wasn't able to fly.In Vampire Smile you can do the same or simply teleport around until the soldiers start to hang down from their ropes, teleport to them and slice or throw them to pieces.I beat the hardest difficulty simply by throwing everything i could find around.But it is still one of my fav. game series especially because of the art, the music, the atmosphere and the fast paced action.Now all we need is Dishwasher Dead Samurai on Pc and maybe a third game?"

Its such a fun game to play from running around stabbing people with needles or cutting peoples heads off with some over sized scissor. The story can be a littlev confusing and you get three different stories when play as Dish Washer, The Prisoner, or play Co-op. The only down side to this game is that online play sucks. I have tried with multiple people and you always get stuck in some board. Great local co-op though."

,Recommended,268990,34851193,Posted: 9 September,all,Asunder™,"I was hesitant while buying this game, I'm not gonna lie. But when I actually got into the game, it became so much fun. It only took me about 5 hours to complete, but there is so much more you can do in the game it's not even a problem. There is actually two characters to pick from when you're doing story mode, each one with a different story. There is even other gamemodes like arcade. It took me 5 hours to complete only 1 character, so you could really do a lot of grinding in this game if you would like, because there is more than enough content. My only real problem is co-op is very glitchy and messes up sometimes and you have to restart the level, which gets pretty annoying. But other than that, it really is a great game and 100% worth the $10."

Yaye!In the core it is a highly stylized and very violent game. But the violence becomes very soon part of the graphical design of the game.It is a very fast, highly addictive beat em up with a great story, likeable characters and a very, very dark and brutalized tone. If you are into graphical violence AND/or overstylized games, then you are going to love The Dishwasher.Hopes are up, that we will also get the first Dishwasher.

,Recommended,268990,31717688,Posted: 13 May,all,Rinera,"I haven't put enough hours in the game yet, but you know what? This game deserves some words regardless. In one hour I am confident enough to recommend it cause it's.. DAMN.. GOOD!One thing first though. Do not expect a lot of depth per weapon. It's fairly basic hack'n'slash spam one to two buttons, no huge Devil May Cry-like combos. Does that make it bad? Heck no! Just a fair warning to not have unreasonable expectations.Okay? Okay...Look at that price! 10 dollars. What would you expect out of 10 dollars? Bugger all probably, that's the kind of price ""walking-simulators"" tend to go for. But no, no no no no nooo. What you get is bloody gore-fest that even has local co-op. Yeah you read that right, LOCAL.. CO-OP! Multiplayer too.Speaking of bloody gore, there's ton of it, and all very well animated for the artstyle chosen. You feel the strength of your actions and get to enjoy the murderous rampage you are in throughout the whole experience. Said experience being a Metrovania game at heart but with a level selection.Though it doesn't only let you select levels, it lets you select character even! In fact, depending on the character you pick or depending whether you play co-op or not you get to see different cutscenes. The cutscenes are kinda like a very short comic, following the general artstyle of the game, which is not bad, though personally I didn't really like it that much. They don't look as crispy as the rest of the game, fairly pixelated. But whatever, they don't last too long.Having that said, the story isn't really that engaging so those low-quality cutscenes are kinda the icing on the cake. Minor spoilers, it's arevenge story where your character starts from the bottom of the situation, gets powerful, goes after revenge.However, there's enough hints around to keep it a tiny bit spicy, making you wonder what happened and wanting to get those few answers. Will they come? No idea, but even if they do not there's still some satisfying combat to be had!What can I say about combat? It's amazingly satisfying. There, done! Okay fine...There's a complete lack of blocking, only dodging, so it's all about keeping up a fast pace and picking your enemies out fast enough to not die, and at higher difficulties you WILL die. The game tends to drop a lot of enemies at you and the AI is not dumb. If they could they would be killing you actively but there's some limitations to them thankfully. On the other hand, at lower difficulties the game should be fairly ""relaxing"", as relaxing as a massacre of screaming humanoids could be, though I imagine a few accidental deaths can happen there too. The bosses get tricky very fast. In usual Metrovania style you get multiple weapons and magic that you can swap around on the fly and sometimes use to unlock new passages even, which is where a big part of the fun comes from, mastering the swaping and usage of all your arsenal.Though nothing is perfect, and the kinda annoying issue that the game has is that you cannot cancel animations into dodge, so no matter how fast you are you could get hit because you were mid combo. Luckily, there's some ways around it but it's possible you will feel a bit cheated sometimes. Just don't spam that attack button will you?Well, that's about it really. Most importantly it's SO freaking worth it for 10 dollars, be it alone or with a friend. Do you think you'd like it from what the videos and screenshots show? If so, give it a try!"

BIG yes. So far, gameplay wise, it's the best side scrolling beat'em up I've ever played. The gameplay is fast paced, smooth, and VERY satisfying. Both with controller AND keyboard.-NOTE: For the keyboard though, you're gonna want to go into your options, and switch your, ""Blood Warp"" ability to the, ""F"" key. You'll know what I mean once you get the Blood Warp ability. (You get it within the 1st 5-10 minutes of playing)=========Now, as for the art style; it's incredible. (Like how I used that semicolon? Yah, I'm a smart boy.) Very stylized and well drawn. I really don't know what else to say about it besides I love it.=========THE STORY! I like it. It's got a main character you can get behind and root for, villains you can hate, and some cute moments sprinkled around here and there. (""I'm gonna call you Paka, cat~. Coming with me?"" -Yuki)=========Wifu potential?: Aahhh, we're at this part of the review.Dishwasher: Would be good husbandu. Glowing personality, good sense of humor, takes initiative, and is a dishwasher-vampire-ninja/samurai, so that's cool.-Yuki: Precious cinnamon bun who wants reveng, and to cuddle with her kitty. Simple girl with simple wants. 2 kyoot 4 tis' wurld. But yo, real talk tho, (I kinda hope my IRL friends don't see this but...) her battle grunts are actually super cute... ""HUAAAH!!!"" ""OOOUUU!!!"" Cute. Also she has a chainsaw for one of her arms, that's pretty neat.=========PRICE: Game is only ten bucks, $10.00. It's so worth it.=========How would I rate this game overall?: 69/69 (Aaaaawww,yeeeeah.)But yo tho, this game is actually amazing."
,Recommended,268990,31734731,Posted: 13 May,all,William Shakesman,"Fast, brutal, and stylish. That's what Dishwasher is. A side-scrolling stylish action game where your dodge is basically Nightcrawler's teleport. You constantly warp and roll around, slicing at enemies, tangling with their blocks, bleeding them out, and then ripping them apart with an execution when they're ready to die. Weapon switch cancelling, dodge cancelling, slow-downs on powerful hits, all the good stuff is there. (FYI: Weapon switch cancelling is the most important part.)The slow weapons hit like beasts, the fast weapons still feel good too.For a game made by just two people, it's really good. The combat mechanics are dead on (Though I would take issue with a couple of enemy attack hitboxes), the aesthetic is heavy metal complete with electric guitar/violin solos as rhythm minigames. The story plays into this well, managing to be edgy enough for heavy metal but not enough to cause cringe*. Two characters, 9 weapons plus guns... This is simply an excellent port of an excellent game.There is not much to the game beyond the combat. The levels tend to have several paths to hide items/equippables but they don't waste your time. Four difficulties and a timed speed-run mode with leaderboards. Then a challenge mode with well over 50 combat challenges of varying configurations, and then a survival mode. Dishwasher knows what it is good at and gives you a lot of ways to enjoy it. If you are at all interested in side-scrolling stylish combat action or curious to see what the devs of Salt and Sanctuary did before that game, take a plunge.*As an aside, this storytelling skill is what S&S vets might expect. In Salt and Sanctuary the same devs wrote a Dark Souls style story better than the Dark Souls devs ever did."

I'm a huge fan of Bayonetta and why I'm bringing this here??? Well.... the shortest way to put it out... This is Bayonetta in 2D.I missed the game when the game came out in 2011... I didn't have an Xbox and I didn't heard about it when I bought the game I didn't know which kind of game to expect but.... I bought it, downloaded it and I started to play and was a huge surprise specially when I started to play... the game has a very deep combo system like the good hack & slash games... there's a score for the combo of course and also there are penalties if you take hits.... if you are a Bayonetta player you know what I'm talking about at this pointThen the game let you have two set of weapons, each one with a couple of weapons....I can add that each playable character have 10/12 weapons with a very very deep combo system... so... with 10/12 weapons, you can imagine the possibilties you can get in between weapons combinations and set of weapons... it's insane the depth of this game.Also as far as I know the game have more than one playable character and the story is different. Also the weapons are different for each playable character.As you play the game, the game has difficulty levels to unblock... again like Bayonetta and also the game have an arcade mode... this is like Angel Slayer from Bayonetta...it's basically like a challenge system inside of an arena and I hasn't start that part yet but it's a huge part of the game... 51 missions/verses in the arcade mode...The game has a combo practice room where you can see the combo list for the weapons that you have and practise with an enemy... the game has boss battles... is pretty much Bayonetta in 2D in every single way...Also the price of the game is like 7/8 pounds...I can't recommend enough this game.If you like a game with a very deep gameplay system where the controlis all about presicion and technique... this is your game right here...thisgame offer hundreds of hours of good gameplay if you want to master it."

The combat feels raw and visceral while the handdrawn style of the Silvas is awe inspiring and certainly not to be slept on.

The sword fighting is the most satisfying of any 2D game out there.The first thing you will be struck by is the impressive styel.  The art, music, and overall presentation make it look like a dark indie comic brought to life.  From there, the combat sucks you in.  There are a variety of weapons and combos that make you feel like you could take on an entire army.In combat, you are given two hand held weapons at a time and able quickly switch during combat allowing you to come up with custom combos.  You also have a machine gun, chainsaw, and sometimes a shotgun to spice things up even further.Fatalities are the cherry on top.  The brutality of smashing heads against the wall until they explode makes combat that much more satisfying.The story mode is great, but the main attraction are the Arcade and Challenge modes that let you drop in and out for quick combat."

Plus a chainsaw arm.If the developer didn't go their own different way with their take on the 2D Beat-em up with Charlie Murder and the equally acclaimed Salt & Sanctuary, I would have been perfectly fine if this became one of the faces of Xbox.  While that's clearly not the route they took, to have it now up on Steam for all is certainly a treat, especially to newcomers.  The only part lacking is the, well, lack of the original title.

,Recommended,268990,31922244,Posted: 23 May,all,Arctick,"Outstanding game for anyone who loves brawler-types gameplay. I played the hell out of Salt&Sanctuary (same devs) and noticed/enjoyed a lot of the same elements and themes.  A lot of the soundeffects are totally identical to S&S but they're damn good soundeffects so I didn't mind. The combo system was gory and fun. The weapons were creative and with a little bit of effort I found them easy to master. The dodging system (or warping as I call it) was a little confusing at first, mainly because I found it hard to believe that dodging could be so OP (you basically can warp in any direction with 0 cooldown, essentially granting you unlimited invulnerable flight).  However, this mechanic fits the game's playstyle and doesn't negate the difficulty at all. Pretty dope. The only negative thing I have to say is that while the story was excellent and visceral, it simply wasn't long enough.  Today is my second day owing the game and I've already completed the game with both characters. No, I didn't spend all day on it either, overall I spent about 3 1/2 hours on each playthrough and I'm not a speedrunner. Granted, I haven't spent much time on arcade mode or gone back through to make sure I found all beads, upgrades, guitar solos, etc. So aside from a short story mode, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys gory brawler games or who has played S&S."

Mechanics are a blast and the art style is unique adds greatly to the experience.I must also note just how wonderfully helpful and responsive the developers are.  Yesterday I was having a slight problem with my saves (which turned out to be entirely my fault, not a bug). I posted the problem I was having on the discussion board asking for help in general, and within an hour or two one of the developers personally responded to my comments. Through several exchanges, he walked me through possible causes of the issue and solutions, and even had me email him my save file so he could inspect it. It was really a pleasure getting extensive help from such an engaged developer, and really bodes well for the future of this game and all their others (like Salt and Sanctuary, which is just amazing!).So, hats off to the developers for making such a great game.

,Recommended,268990,35229559,Posted: 26 September,all,Chrionz,"When I saw this come onto Steam, I became excited. I remembered playing this with my brother when I was a kid after buying it from the XBLA. However, I was hesitant to buy it, afraid that my love for it would be torn after not looking at it through the nostalgic glasses. I bit the bullet and decided to get it. I'm happy to say that it more than holds up to me.Gameplay:This game... is amazing. Even though it looks like a metroidvania, it is not. It has elements such as getting keys and backtracking, however it is divided into levels. The hacking and slashing feels fluent and always feels like I'm in control. It's frantic hack n' slash at it's best with an amazing soundtrack. That being said, the game is hard. However, it doesn't take the easy way out with manufactured difficulty by throwing too much at you. The combat is genuinely challenging and requires you to change your weapons on the fly. There are a couple mechanics that are not fully realized, such as the dodge/shift ability. I always felt that you should be able to stun them if you phase through them. These mechanics would mean nothing if the game was poorly ported. However, that is not the case. I did not encounter a single crash and while there are no graphical settings apart from monitor selection, resolution, full-screen/windowed/borderless-windowed mode select, and v-sync toggle (happy to say the with it on, I did not see any input lag), the game is not graphically demanding at all and should run fine on most rigs. The only downside I see is the frame-rate locked at 60fps, even with vsync off. It didn't affect me since I have a 60hz monitor, but I know some people care about their unlocked framerates.The game is short, me beating one of the stories in a little under 4.5 hours. That beign said, it is a game that offers more than one playthrough. You have challenges, the arcade, and playing the other side of the story. Oh yeah, and do yourself a favor and use a controller. You're welcome.Graphics:Originally being an XBLA title, you shouldn't expect breathtaking visuals. However, the art style in itself is breathtaking. It does have that flash game comic feel to the graphics on the surface, however it's stylized and polished in such a way that it doesn't feel like it could have been released on newgrounds in 2009. The dark and grungy color pallet suits the massive amounts of red that you'll be spraying all over the enviornments. I do not have the original version on hand, however I'll have to assume that they made the textures sharper. I don't remember if the XBLA version was 60fps either.The story:I won't be spoiling anything here, just my thoughts on the basic premise of the story. It's a story. It's not the center point, as the action is. There are two characters to play as, each has their own story. Well, kind of. They do have their own weapons and kind of their own story, but it follows the basic outline. It kind of feels like a reskin when playing as a different character.The verdict:I love this game. It holds up extremely well and I'm extremely happy to get it. It is well optomized, has an amazing soundtrack that compliments the dark and grusome atmosphere amazingly. At $10, it's a great value."
