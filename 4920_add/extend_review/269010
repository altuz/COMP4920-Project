With the power of science, of course!Science Girls is a classic turn-based RPG, where you explore the map, fight the enemies and gradually uncover what is going on. It also features extensive dialogues that often let you pick protagonist’s response. And not only the girls have distinct personalities, each of them specializes in a particular scientific field, which add to their uniqueness not only in battles, but during the conversations as well.In short, if you enjoy turn-based RPGs, Science Girls are most definitely worth getting."

If you're into psuedo rpg/visual novel/japanese school girl uniforms, you'll probaby enjoy it.Instead of classes, you have majors of study, which was nice take, credit where credit's due.I'm on the fence with this one; the game feels... unfinished, certain elements of the game feel unbalanced: Heather is practically your designated hitter the moment you get her, and Jennifer is the only healer you've got.  Missy's tooling didn't seem to matter much, and Nicole should be renamed Hiroshima, she does one thing and one thing well.I'll leave you to guess.Pro tip: go sparringly on the consumables, they're extremely finite, and you'll need them for the last boss."

The characters are fun but the further you go the more leveling your characters seems to punish you by greatly increasing point requirements for performing actions while doing nothing to accelerate recovery of said points or providing much in the way of recovery items. The gameplay responsiveness is unreasonably crunchy, and shortly into the game battles just become increasingly numbing repeats of your team against armies of self-replicating enemies that just take too long to clear only to get into another same-same-same fight only moments later, taking even longer as it becomes more costly for your characters to perform their actions. If the repetition doesn't sound like a big deal to you, you may well enjoy it.Maybe we'll get to see these fun characters in a different game at some point.Short version: Good characters, but slow and repetitive gameplay that gets slower and more repetitive."

It's their because they wanted to do an RPG/VN. It serves no purpose.The RPG protion of the game is sloppy. You have no way to gain consumables outside of combat. You have no place or way to rest/heal. The combat is slow, tedious and poorly designed. The basic attacks are worthless, so you end up in a ring of defending and healing just trying to get your party ready for the next fight. The character sprites could have used some variation other than hair.Even on the hardest mode, their is no challenge. It just requires you to spend more time in the defend/heal/use special loop.Moving the character on the map works best with mouse. Using the kyeboard is clunky.Going through combat is best with the keyboard as using the mouse get tiresome quickly and you can accidently misclick quite easily.Controller support might as well be yanked. Moving is sluggish, accessing menu's is unintuitive, and using special attacks sometime breaks it so that you can't do anything until you use the mouse/keyboard.And finally the biggest question for a game: was it fun? The anser is no. It was slow, had no real story to speak of, troped characters and tedious combat that monopolizes the majority of the game.I loved other games by the publisher, specifically LLTQ. So this game came as quite a let down."

The battles threaten to become a grind before you're quite able to unlock something else or run into anything new. A fair amount of the game's length is fake - walking around running into repetitive mob packs. There's also a bit of a balance issue in that there's no renewable source for items so you fashion your party in such a way as to have enough sustain to farm battles for SP. Not surprising then, that of the people who played the game long enough to get back the box of doughnuts (~25%), only slightly more than a quarter (~6.4%) bothered to finish the game.There isn't all that much of a story either - just a few lines of comedy and simple decision points stuck along a linear narrative. The alien overworld art is conspicuously ugly. The recorded character sounds are actively offensive even if you watch anime. Fortunately, there's an option to turn off the yell-on-attack sounds, but you'll steal hear them screech every time you get hit.At $5, borderline purchase. Wait for a sale."

The story is at times funny, imformative and also a little slice of life. Well, as slice of life as one can expect when there are aliens involved. I would have liked a bit more of a solid storyline regarding all the science involved but on the stuff it does touch on, I can't complain. It plays like your typical turn based RPG so pick your attacks and level them wisely. Speaking of leveling, it has a really cool system in that it allows you to pick any aspect you want to upgrade. It could be a move or your stats. It also has good music, a random assortment of food items, and replay value.I definitely reccomend this game."

76561198108296385,Recommended,269010,30990421,Posted: 6 April,all,Dreamミ☆Cast,Science Girls is a nice RPG that manages to pack quite a bit into a little package. Each of the main characters are unique and have their own personalities and I personally enjoyed the way the overworld map of the school was done (reminded me of a Clue board). However it is very bare bones as grinding is the only way to get stronger there is no equipment you can upgrade your characters with. With that being said it is also a bit on the easy side as I'm playing on graduate difficulty without having too much of a problem. Overall its a nice game if you're looking for a light RPG but I would try something else if you want a serious game/challenge.

,Recommended,269010,9907130,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,dairy farmer,"Science Girls: The members of a science club rally together, using science to save the world.Total playtime: 7.5 hours according to in-game clock on normal difficulty (Steam didn't track my first few hours accurately).It's a nice enough game if you understand what you're getting. It's not going to replace any of your other PC or console RPGs, but it doesn't claim to, and it doesn't ask much of your wallet either. The game reminds me a bit of old (S)VGA DOS anime RPGs back in the late 90s.The first half of the game plays like a light RPG+visual novel. During this period you meet your team members, get to know them a bit, and discover the situation you're all in. Combat is fairly light, being limited to one random encounter per room or screen you enter. I think this part of the game is balanced well, with frequent ""story"" segments regularly breaking up the short strings of battles and exploration.The second half of the game adopts a more JRPG style with an overhead world map and visible wandering enemies. However, dodging enemies is limited since they seem to constantly spawn and swarm you, and most of your time is spent navigating labyrinth-like narrow passages with an annoying number of branching dead ends. Decades of JRPG grinding has worn me thin, so this was more annoying than fun, but I'm sure many people won't mind. Depending on your preference, you should adjust the game difficulty at the beginning accordingly.Bosses are a slightly more interesting affair compared to regular battles, but they are still fairly easy. The last battle, however, was a surprising spike in difficulty. It was probably the first time Ireallyhad to make full tactical use of all six girls. I still beat it though, and I even had 1-2 skill points on each girl that I hadn't used yet.You have six party members, three of which can act in each round. They can be swapped out with no penalty at any time, leading to surprising flexibility in combat options, which is probably most necessary in the harder difficulties. You can choose to equally balance all girls and swap them regularly to moderate SP use, or you can specialize the girls in certain roles, like having three for front-line fighting, and swapping the others in as needed to unload their souped-up skills.The girls themselves are nice enough in personality, although I wish there was a bit more talk and story bits with them. The actual science in the game is pretty light too, and nothing you wouldn't have learned in high school. I wonder if a younger child would like this game? Humor is pretty mild, but it's charming enough, and it mostly comes from the girls' personalities.Character art is decent, but the girls look way too similar (palette/paperdoll swaps?). Audio is nothing to write home about. Sound effects and voices are tolerable (excepting Nicole's voice when she gets hit in combat), even if the way they talk in Japanese is puzzling. Some of the music tracks are tolerable, but I imagine most people will mute it after an hour or two."

,Not Recommended,269010,29350687,Posted: 18 January,all,Onikazejin,"Watching attacks miss on both sides of a turn-based RPG battle system for turns on end quickly turned any enthusiasm I had for this game to nothing very quickly. This is one of, but not the least of, many deep flaws that Science Girls has. Let's get some positives out of the way first, though.Pros:-The idea of female protagonists in a video game is always a welcome change for me. That I can respect, even moreso when it's done right and holds up to other ""good"" games. I can't fault games for trying, and won't overlook that for a second. More on that later however.-Within battling itself, each character has a specialized role that they basically fill, akin to a class in most other RPGs of this nature. Giving attacks and spells to each character's ""class"" in this case allows you to find a relatively niche use for probably five of the six girls, the sixth only having a scan ability and not much else of use. The rest, however, are all viable picks for battle. Which is good, because you have all six of them within the first hour and will need a good balance to survive this game. Additionally, each girl learns a ""finisher"" skill at level 6 that will grant them extra exp at the end of the battle if they killed an enemy with it. All of these help phenominally with leveling and the idea itself is unique and pretty cool. I wouldn't mind seeeing it in other games, at that.Unfortunately, that's where the positives stop for me. Let's move onto cons.-Everything about this game feels so slow. The pacing of the game itself, the movement, the progression of the plot, and especially the battling. I would go through one battle and it would feel like fifteen minutes had passed. In one instance of a boss battle, it actually did take that long and felt more like half an hour. More on why battling is bad in a minute.-The plot itself is tolerable at best and hollow at worst. You follow six girls fending off an alien invasion who seem to be after...people's hair? For some reason? That's really all I got. There isn't any more than that. It's weird, kinda creepy, and probably isn't taking anything seriously in the least minus the scientific concepts. Speaking of...-This game throws around scientific concepts and the like like there's no tomorrow. Expect half of them really feel like there's no meaning to them. They talk about wormholes briefly, except nothing about wormholes is ever explained. They come up with different ways to cross paths that might be dangerous, but who cares? I just want to cross a ♥♥♥♥ing bridge, I don't need some complicated solution on how to do it carefully. I most certainly didn't learn anything from it, and it just didn't feel like it went outside the box to make it really interesting or even remotely fun.-The art and sound are absolutely atrocious. I played the whole game with my sound muted because it was driving me up a wall to hear one of the characters cry out like a stereotypical anime girl every time they attacked something. Every. Single. Time. The music is lackluster and carries no sense of urgency. The school is the most generic school you could possibly see, consisting of empty classroom backgrounds and occasionally a storage room or cafeteria. The alien homeworld is no better, just feeling like an empty landscape that I have to trudge across for minutes on end in between the constant battles I have no chance of avoiding. The only thing you can do to tell the girls apart from one another is their hairstyles; oftentimes I would confuse them, even though I've been staring at them all for the past five minutes in battle. The only other NPC in the game is a bald teacher, and the entire cutscene he was in just made me cringe. Just...take my word for it.-The characters themselves are also bland, uninteresting, and have little personality. Each of them is a student in a specific scientific field and... ...well, they do scientific things related to that field. In their profiles, each of them have three ""likes"" of completely mundane things, like horses, or pizza, or movies. That and their interactions throughout the game is all you get on them. Their humor isn't even cheeky. It's doesn't make me laugh, or even giggle. It falls flat in every instance. The protagonists here are one-dimensional. This isn't what I want when I say female protagonists. I want female protagonists with depth, an interesting personality, and a valid reason for doing what they do. ""Let's save the world with the power of sicence lul"" doesn't count. It's insulting.-Oh boy, the BATTLING. Battling is many things. Battling is slow, unrewarding, trudging, and the worst part of the game. Maybe, possibly, it was because I was playing on the harder difficulty, but let's still go over every little thing that contributed to me wanting to throw my computer out the window in detail. First off, attacks will miss. A LOT. On both sides. Battles will drag on and on because neither side can land a hit on the other for possibly turns on end. Damage is always between two numbers, a low end and a high end. So when you finally do connect, you could do fifteen damage! Or you could do two. To get a higher low end, you have to level up a skill when you level up. However, that also increases the amount of SP you need to use the skill. It is ridiculous how much some of the higher level skills will costs. Upwards of 2/3 of your total SP.Items are finite. The only HP and SP restoring items you get are the ones you find on the map. There are no places to fully restore your health, except through level up. If you run out of SP, you have to defend to gain two back per turn (that character's ENTIRE turn) and an extra bonus one if everyone in the front row is defending. Characters in the back row do nothing, not even gain HP and SP back, unless they're brought into the front. Yet, they're still susceptible to attacks. Why? You can't attack their back row. Enemies will always have stronger attacks than you. Certain enemies will counterattack EVERY attack you throw at them, miss or not. Bosses are extreme damage sponges unless you've invested a lot into your attacks or exploit the system in very specific ways. It's impossible to tell how much of a chance you have to actually hit an enemy unless you raise your accuracy stat, but then you're wasting skill points. The amount of exp you need to get even past level 10 merits battles and battles of grinding even with the finisher moves. And you know what? Those aren't even guaranteed to hit. One character in particular, had a 9/25 success rate of hitting random battle enemies with her finisher. That's nearly a third. Yes, I counted. Strangely enough, in every boss encounter, she seemed to hit every single time.I am just. So worn out over this game. I didn't expect it to be great, but I figured it could be worth the time playing. It wasn't. Hardly any of the game was enjoyable to me, and if I was so tenacious in getting all the achievements, I wouldn't have bothered. Spare yourself the purchase. The people that made this have made much better games than this."

I enjoyed the corky storyline and goofy characters in this game, however I found the battling system to be very frustrating at times. Often I ended up hitting the wrong button because of how close together the list of options was and I don't think there was a way to change the option you picked...or at least I couldn't find it. I also feel like the enemy to player damaged/defense ratio to be unfair. The characters did not really do a whole lot of damage despite me putting skill points into almost everything and the characters didn't dodge quite as much as the enemies did which made me rage quit a few times and it also drew the battles out too long. However I did still enjoy this game over all even though I found it frustrating.

,Recommended,269010,20745138,"Posted: 25 January, 2016",all,Cela Shyish,"I sincerely enjoy this game, the characters are all interesting, cute and with their own quirks and styles of combat based on their area of science. The characters are actually believeable to people who have worked/lived closely with people of other scientific professions and I have actually had many of these conversations myself. The combat system does become a bit more difficult later on based on the recovery rate of sp being identical regardless of level but with skills requiring more as they level up but this puts more importance on planning whether the extra damage/effect is worth the sp cost, although it doesn't become too much of an issue if you plan ahead, it is a cute game and I enjoy it so I definitely recommend it and I personally would love to see a sequel or more games from this creator."

I'd play it again on my leisure. This game has a nice story, interesting characters, and to be honest a nice feel to it. It's a definite 8-9 in my book almost 10. Almost however it superceded what I was expecting."

Lots of game play, medicore story, very skill intensive and challenging combat system has different difficulty levels. The characters are not to interesting. If you are in the mood for a challenging rpg of watching six cute girls fight monsters this is up your alley. If you are looking for a game that focuses more on characters and story then this should be avoided."

BUT I LOVED THIS THING TO DEATH!I started playing this game and once I started getting the characters I fell in love with them, with one exception the main character WHO HAS NO PERSONALITY AND VIRTUALLY NO DIALOGUE!Each of the girls is a reference to a different science, their attacks, dialogue, and abilities all reference what science they are linked to in some way, I adored this.This game has a relatively simple feel, which is nice, but you can if you know what you are doing do some rather powerful attacks.The battles don't vary much through the game, there are a small handful of various enemy types, and there are a total of 5 big bosses in the game, which although are simple do provide some extra challenge.This game was short, I beat it in roughly 6 hours or so in 2 play sessions, it was overall fun, and one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time.  It wasn't Dreamscape, but this was quite a gem, if you see it on sale for $2 or less BUY IT!"
76561198327901000,Recommended,269010,33414988,Posted: 9 July,all,Ghostfriendly,"This was a very fun storyline/battle game; despite minimal story and choices six quirky and unique characters were sketched very efficiently. The player controls a party of schoolgirls with a growing range of science themed weapons, engaging plant monsters in kinetic, boardgame-like turn based combat.The exploration and combat systems, the larger part of the game, are constantly throwing unexpected problems at the player, making play challenging and interesting, without ever being frustrating (except on the wormhole level, but what are guides for?). Mechanics are not unecessarily complicated, and there is plenty of room for basic tactics. The variety of imaginatively science-themed attacks, food items that could be dispensed with, and difficulty that could be increased, mean that this game would probably have good replay value too."
,Recommended,269010,33780082,Posted: 24 July,all,Sylnt Crane,"It’s an alright RPG. The reason I bought this game was for the characters whom I thought have neat personality quirks to them. I liked the six-person combat to it which sets it apart from the generic four-person party most RPGs have. Still, the combat itself has much to be desired in execution and the story itself isn’t that memorable. Overall, if you like what you see, get it. If you don’t, there’s other RPGs you can try out."
