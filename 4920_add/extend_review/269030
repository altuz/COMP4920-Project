It feels like a demo, or the introduction to a larger game. The entire game plays out like the character creation for a game that never happens. You spend six weeks making decisions that shape and define your character, each one including a small flavor text choice that lets you deepen your character choices, and then, when it feels like the game should be starting for real, all you do is pick a profession and see how good your character is at that profession.I wanted to be a part of this world, I wanted to take my character out, to play a game with them. Who doesn't want that? This game is maybe worth a dollar. I wont say that I feel cheated, because I truly savor and enjoy the narrative, and the very novelty of a cooperative choose your own adventure experience was just enough to make me feel like at least I had gotten something interesting and beautiful, if lacking, but I would not recommend this for every gamer.Be very aware, this game is extremely content light, and there is no campaign. Once your character is created after six weeks of character creation choices, that's the end of it. I really crave more, and am very disappointed in how little is here."

I liked her comics and so bought the game, but was honestly disappointed.  The 'game' is nothing more than a collection of Carroll's stories told in a branching narrative fashion.  The game functions by having you choose what each character is doing each week but results are unpredictable and seem arbitrary.  Each game of The Yawhg is very short, not allowing for any sense of attachment to develop with the characters you're controlling.  Ultimately, you're just clicking around to see what pops out next.   While I love the artwork and scenarios that occured, I can't help but feel this really should have just been a series of webcomics rather than a video game.  Overall it left me wanting."

In four-five play throughs i had the same things happen pretty much every time.  The music is nice but there is no menu option anywhere so you cant turn down the volume or resize the screen or anything.  In addition it managed to crash a couple of times which is just rediculous in a six turn game.  It would have been a really good game if there was a decent amount of content but sadly as it is its only good for a few minutes.

It's all pretty straight-forward: you and/or your friends each choose a character (you can also choose characters yourself and play the game on your own) and choose a location you wish to go to. Each location has a couple of options on actions you can perform, such as cutting wood, tending to patients, and yes, even getting drunk! But beware: each choice you make might positively or negatively affect your stats. After a couple of turns, the mysterious Yawhg happens and each person will have to choose a role which fits their character's stats best (or you can do the opposite, and watch the outcome!), after which you'll get to know whether your town survived, and -more importantly- how your characters pick up their life again afterwards.The Yawhg is a funny little game which you can play with friends. The graphics are all really fitting and nice, the music is simple, yet suits the game and the absolute highlight of the game is the amount of choices you can make, and the randomnized events you'll encounter. However, the game is VERY short. Almost too short. And that, in my humble opinion, is the only thing where it falls short, for me personally. However, the replay value is very big.Get it during a sale, or if you like experimental choice-heavy little games like this one.All in all, 7/10"

Even $1 seems like a high asking price. The game has beautiful art, relaxing music, and the writing is amusing or even heartwarming at times. The way the game maintains continuity over a single playthrough is nothing new for video games, but in a ""board game"" it might lend it a small air of novelty.But, frankly, there's almost no gameplay. It's pretty much a very short, interactive, multiplayer visual novel. A match will last around 8-10 minutes per player. There are 6 turns, and they amount to picking one of eight locations, then making two binary choices at each of these locations to somewhat randomly gain or lose stat points. These points will affect how successful you are at succeeding the second binary choice each turn, depending on what, precisely, the choice is. With a very small number of art assets and almost no gameplay, the game survives entirely on its writing. At a maximum of 40 minutes per game and low variety per playthrough, you are unfortunately likely to get more value out of riffing on a movie with friends than The Yawhg.I really want to recommend this game, but its brevity and shallowness just keep me from being able to justify saying anyone should spend money on it. The experience was enjoyable, but there's just not enough there."

You and three friends take roles in the town just a week before ensured destruction. Attend a ball, clean a hospital, or even fight crime. The Yawhg presents imminent danger and allows you to forge a healthy backstory and stat sheet in only a few days. The real treasure is seeing how these actions affect your friends or the town itself. Once the town is overcome with darkness, it's up to you and your friends to triumph or despair with your experiences.It's a superb bit of storytelling."

You spend a few days building your heroes with jobs and chores, and the game ends with a pass/fail test determined by what stats you built. It’s the charming, quirky, digital equivalent of drawing straws, and while the Yawhg may be a good case study for developers looking to make choose-your-own-adventure type games in the future, it offers very little for people wanting an enjoyable experience now."

I decided to recommend it, but I thought I would leave some information so that others considering purchasing will understand what they are buying.1) This game is a text-based ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" game. There is art (and I like the art) and music (and I like the music), but ultimately, it's about the choices you make.2) The game is very short. It is completed in 6 turns. However, there are a variety of options  to choose from. There are different endings, so choose wisely.3) If you are looking for a more typical ""rpg"" experience, this is not for you. If you are looking for something fun, rather light, and enjoyable with friends, this is a good game to pick.4) I recommend purchasing the game on sale. It is just a little too pricey at it's original price in my opinion, but nabbing it on sale is generally a good idea. I got it at a slight discount.5) The game is turn-by-turn and is certainly not going to eat any significant amount of your time. If you just need something sort of light to play for ten minutes, this is a good game to pick up. If you are looking for a somewhat more serious game purchase, perhaps you should not buy this. I do not have a lot of time logged in at all, but I have already beat the game a few times.6) The game, even though it is short, does have some replay value.7) Ahem. Demon baby. That was unexpected. Especially when it stopped being a baby...Ultimately, I recommend it. Just remember that this is not a typical gaming experience, and gamers who prefer more standard grinding/number crunching/tactics-style games might want to give this a pass. If you're the type of person to be fascinated by choices and options, to see how your choices affect others and endings, then you might like this."

You can actually increase the stats of your character in order to make a choice at the ""end"" of the game when the Yawgh arrives.The bottom line with this game is that it's meant to be a hot-seat game you play with your friends.  It's not really that much fun to play alone since you can see just about every choice in a couple playthroughs.  But, with friends it'll take a bit longer to get through.So, if you like a story that can have some humorous turns or some dramatic fallout from seemingly simple choices, then this might be a fun game for you."
,Recommended,269030,10960394,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Grumbeld,"It's a simple enough concept of a game.  Four people go about their lives for 6 weeks, visiting up to 8 locations and choosing one of two actions at the location they choose.  Each choice will provide a bonus to the character's stats, and there will be a secondary event.  After 6 weeks, the town will be destroyed and you choose a role in order to help rebuild.That is the gameplay in its entirety.  The genius of the game comes from the varied events, how those events can lead to other events, and the beautiful resolution as you're told what your character does with his/her life.  Also, the music is well-thought out.  I think there's only three separate songs for the six weeks, and they all use the same theme with an increase in tension as The Yawhg approaches.  The final song, however, is amazing and I don't think I'll ever grow tired of hearing it.  Whether it's $5 or $10, I insist that you pick this up, sit down with some friends, and live life inside of The Yahwg."

Went into this epecting something along the lines of Arkham Horror, ended up with something that feels like a newgrounds-era dating sim."
,Recommended,269030,28844476,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Stratos,"Initially, when I first heard of this game, I just figured, ""hey, this looks kinda neat but I'm not paying $10 for it becuase I'm a lousy cheap♥♥♥♥♥"" It looked like a cool concept to me and if it looks like a cool concept to you, then you're perhaps in for something of a treat.Now, when I first played it on my own, I wasn't particularly entertained. I mean, yes, the different story paths were somewhat interesting and the various different endings were kinda cool but I wasn't really absorbed into it. It was just something I used to make a good 45 minutes pass by one day when I was feeling bored. Then, while with some friends the other night, I decided to pull it out because we all needed a game to play and this just so happened to be multiplayer and seemed like a nice change of pace from the usual stuff we always tend to play (e.g. Genital Jousting, Jackbox Party Pack, etc.) What I didn't expect was for us to keep playing over and over again for several more hours, as we found ourselves unusually entertained by this strange little game.This is because where The Yawhg shines is in its multiplayer gameplay. As you each play through the runs as your individual character, you become attached to the story and are actually quite affected by the events that happen to you. Trying not to spoil any of the specific events as that would take away from your game experience overall, I will say that each event is quite interesting when it first happens. You feel fear, shock, and surprise as you're faced with various choices, unsure of their meaning or where they lead but finding yourself satisfied by the game's clever use of various fantasy cliches to create a coherent story for your character. But it's in this that the game's largest flaw lies. See, there's only a limited number of events that occur, and, though the game is likely designed to be played in sets of multiple consecutive runs, after a few playthroughs you start to see events repeat and they lose the impact that they originally had on the player. No longer does the story really have any sort of impact, and instead you begin picking choices just to try to get a different ending and experimenting, skipping through the game's incredibly creative dialogue and just rushing through each run. It's still enjoyable in a way, but it's a much less interesting experience as the game goes on and on which I was disappointed by to some extent.The gameplay itself is quite simple. The game is more or less a choose-your-own-adventure book, and thus you play it by simply making choices on where to go, what to do, and how to react to the random event that always occurs. The gameplay is there to simply give the player choice, immersing them in the story that the game crafts and presents, and in that regard it succeeds. I truly don't think this game is for everyone, and if you're the type of person who's driven by a ""win-lose"" sort of mindset then this game might not necessarily appeal to you in terms of how it plays, because the enjoyment is not through feeling as though you ""won"" the game. It's through that feeling of autonomy and choice, the decision it grants that makes the player feel unique and able. It does, essentially, what it's supposed to do. The characters will recieved stat boosts that affect their decisions throughout the course of each run, and once you learn what different actions give you then there is some thinking that may go into character building in whatnot, but it's really not sophisticated enough to become the main draw of the game.Graphically the game is quite appealing. The art is drawn cute but not excessively so, and the visuals are primarily presented in a still-painting format that simply serves to accompany the text as opposed to distracting from it, which I thought was a good design decision. The art style is haunting in a way, matching the somber yet somehow mildly humorous nature of this game. Truly, The Yawhg is not a particularly happy game, and it may give you chills if you're not ready for some of what it presents, and the art style adds greatly to this. Musically, the game has a very relaxing, quiet soundtrack, but I was bothered by the fact that often times it consisted of little 6-second loops playing over and over again as the players went through their days. It accompanies the game well enough but the fact that I could hear it looping was quite bothersome. However, there is a full track that plays at the end and beginning of every run that is so intensely haunting and emotional that my friends and I all found ourselves quite affected by it playing.Essentially, the Yawhg is not a game that you'll find yourself playing very often if you do decide to buy it, which is something that you probably should keep in mind when making your purchase. Rather, it's a game that you'll pull out from time to time when you have enough time to forget many of the random events and are able to experience them fully again. Also, it's WAY better with friends. Trust me."

Saying that, you can end up with vastly different characterizations even using the same two people over and over again. The game supports up to 4 characters working in the world at once, and can in fact even be treated as a hotseat multiplayer game.The choices and tasks you do in the game have deep and lasting effects, completely changing which avenues are open to you while keeping all avenues of adventure open.

You can probably finish it inside of five minutes, and it does not take very long at all for the options to start repeating on your multiple playthroughs.

Without spoiling anything I'll just say that no matter how many times you play it you'll likely never really feel as if you know what in the hell is actually going on. That in itself doesn't bother me in the least, but the main reason I have to come down on the side of ""not recommended"" is the price, plain and simple. The game does offer replayability, and in fact sort of encourages it, being a point-and-click with a somewhat variable storyline and outcomes.And maybe you and a group of drunken friends will get some laughs, or be moved to have deep philisophical discussions of the kind that only drunken friends can have, but when all's said and done (which will take very little actual time), your experience with the game may well resemble the experience you'll have the next morning. You'll have a slight headache, and some dim recollection that something meaningful may have happened, and then you'll try to forget the whole thing and get on with your day.If it drops to half price, sure, give it a whirl, but for 10 bucks you can sit this one out and, if you're so inclined, learn everything that can possibly be learned about it by watching a 5 minute video on Youtube, because that's about how much entertainment you'll get in a typical playthroughl anyway."

Sadly ""The Yawhg"" falls short of being enjoyable by simply being lazily released. On just the second playthrough I found myself in situations which felt familiar, largely because I'd been subjected to the same bar-brawl and alchemist mishap just minutes beforehand. The straight lack of variety is what kills this title for me.Sadly my ♥♥♥♥♥ doesn't end there, as being a lazy console port also throat-punched my inner child. You really couldn't remove the ""press A"" prompts? I really have to hold a button down to exit? Come on, give us a proper menu. Finally: Multiplayer - or lack thereof. Who in Robocop's name plays local multiplayer on PC? I'd wager anyone who would even begin to consider it is lacking the ""friends"" prerequisite for multi-user gaming.To summarise, a shoddy port which doesn't try hard enough.

Playing by yourself you'll likely have encountered every possible scenario, or at least have a good idea of what you need to do to get whichever ending you want, after a couple quick playthroughs.  That's where friends come in.  Friends add a layer of challenge to the game, because you can be assured that friends will be the ones to trample all your hopes and dreams of getting a good ending.  Sometimes you can get everyone to work together and other times there'll be that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friend who just wants to do everything in their power to try and make sure everything goes down in flames.  Friends are the random variables that make The Yawhg fun and increase the play time of the game.A single playthrough normally doesn't take too long, but again that all depends on how much time you spend talking over the decisions you need to make and laughing (or crying) over the results you reap from said decisions.Overall for a $10 game it has a lot of playability (if you play with friends).

It's always the same, you can't protect anyone from it, and (despite all the other weird magic stuff in the game) the nature of the disaster is really boring. After the disaster is over, you choose your new post-Yawhg career and succeed or fail (to varying degrees) based on your stat points and sometimes the special events you experienced. (Note that the careers have no stat requirements, because programming in a ""Given that you have literally zero Charm, the other survivors laugh at your suggestion that you should be the leader"" message would have been too much work).A single playthrough lasts about 10-15 minutes.

In the end, I decided on a no because, while it is in equal measures unique, fun, and visually appealing, The Yawhg is, quite frankly, not worth the asking price.On on hand, I really want other people to experience the Yawhg's interactive story. The art is a delight to look at, the writing, although brief, is clever, and most importantly, It's fun, especially if you sit at a computer with a couple friends and play it as a co-op.On the other hand, the game is too short. And I say this as someone who will happily shell out money for short, high-quality games. A playthrough of The Yawhg will last 10-15 minutes at best. You could argue that this is because The Yawhg is meant to be played multiple times, but after five playthroughs, which only took me an hour, I felt like I had seen everything there was to see.The ""randomized"" events are not randomized enough (for example, --mild spoiler-- if you go to the hospital at a certain point in time, your event will always, always be the patient with the sores, which leads into the same chain of events that last the rest of the game). In an even bigger flaw for a game trying to accomplish what The Yawhg is, there also aren't nearly enough events, which is why I felt like I had seen at least 90% of them by the fifth playthrough.More of a subjective complaint, and another mild spoiler, but I found the ending to be a letdown. Not just in the ""wait... that's it? The game is already over??"" sense, but also because I felt like the narrative leading to the ending didn't fit what happened at the end. I do realize that it was intentionally misleading, but just because it was intentional doesn't mean it was carried out well.I love games as a storytelling medium, and I'm so on board with what The Yawhg was trying to do, but it fell short in almost every area. If it had significantly more content, or if it cost $5 instead of $10, I'd be badgering everyone I know to buy it. As it stands, I'd save your money and wait for someone else to come along with a better execution of this very cool concept."

I don't think I'm equipped to choose as a person living in this world would. It's not roleplaying, because I don't know which role I'm playing. Consequences to these choices are often bizarre and do not create what I'd call a coherent consistent world that's reacting to my actions - simple hunting trip may leave you a crazed mass murderer, while pushing a nobleman does nothing but reward you.It's possible these play out differently based on your stats, but the game is simply too short to learn any kind of consistent expectation pattern.In the end, it's all just random and it doesn't matter what you pick, you just do. I didn't feel needed, like the game could just go on for the few minutes and show me the results just the same.I couldn't care less about the people of the town, if they rebuild after the storm or anything else - there's no time and no plot that would make me attached to anything.The visuals are nice, the music is pleasant.

The Yawhg isn't a bad game, in fact the ideas behind the game and the execution are very sound. The problem is that this really shouldn't be a paid product. The Yawhg feels and plays like a free flash game, and ironicly is no where near as good as other Flash games of this type.Unlike the interactive fiction games you find on Kongrigate The Yawhg isn't really a single player game, rather is basicly a digital Cards vs. Humanity type experience (i hope that makes sense). The Yawhg is turnbased, with each turn repersenting a week Players take turns selecting what they will do on any given week, after 7 weeks a great disaster (the titualr Yawhg) will befall the city and using the skills you've learned throughout the last 7 weeks will try to repair the town in the best way you can. the idea being that the event's pre-Yawhg will be so wacky that players will be able to laugh and have a good time and all the post-Yawhg stuff will be really sad and dramatic. In practice though it's horibly broken, the way the game is structured with it's stat system means that after about one playthrough you'll have no problem easily maxing out a stat to win at the end. This would be fine if the random events at the core of the game kept you guessing, but they don't. Not because there bad or anything but because there are so few of them. I bet that if you played the game with four players one you would see everything this game had to offer. So in other words the game has no replay value what so ever and in the end for a game that costs $10 that's unacceptable.It may sound like The Yawhg is the worst thing ever but it's not. It clear that the developers put a lot more heart and soul into it then... other games *cough* Call of Duty *cough* and i would love to see a game like this with a lot more random events. But The Yawhg just feels unfinished, both as a regular video game and as the party based experience it WANT'S to be.

This game is entirely un-animated and the still images consist completely of low-res cartoons.  Gameplay?  You pick options off a menu.  Music?  One guitar.  Story?

The Yawhg does something worth doing and does not need any of these tools to do it.To nitpick the game's description, The Yawhg is not a ""Choose Your Own Adventure.""  Choose Your Own Adventure books very rarely had multiple main characters or stats to track.  The Yawhg is a /Gamebook,/ and while these were great fun in the 80s before we had real branching-path video games, today this is the best possible format for the medium.  The Yawhg is a perfect example of the synergy of right tools and right task, and it is worth the time of anyone who enjoys a good interactive story.  I suppose you might call this a visual novel -- I don't know, really, I feel like genre has become largely irrelevant in describing video games.The story of The Yawhg is different every time you play it, so I can't comment on its quality universally, but if you find yourself telling a story you don't care for, it will only last for 20 more minutes.

A raptor doth approach,"This isn't a game; it is an interactive story that has 7 pages per character, with a wrap-up using details from some of the stuff that happened in the story. You can finish a session in under 5 minutes. For the price, I would heavily recommend watching someone else play it.There is also very little gameplay to speak of. Your character accrue Attributes for each choice you make. Each location gives you a fixed Attribute boost and then a choice to expand upon it (there is usually a positive gain). At the end of the game, you will have to make a choice - the outcome of which depends on the choices you made. This means that, from a gameplay perspective, it is incredibly shallow - since every location gives you a fixed benefit at the start, simply maximising it will let you power through to ""win the game"". I, in fact, could list what locations to visit to win the game right now but that would be exceedingly heartless. But I could and that fact should display how shallow it is.Story-wise, there is some continuity from one day to another but in general, there is not much connectivity. This is to be expected between characters, the point of the story is to display days lived out in the lives of these arbitrary characters in this city. However, the fact that there is very little connectivity within the events of any individual storyline basicly renders most of the events as stand-alone vignettes that could have happened to any other character and NOT the character you chose. In other words, unless you get one of the continuity-based events (which still only really leak into the next week's event), your character does not have a developing personal storyline, just a sequence of events that happened to happen to him/her.A final point on the gameplay as it relates to the story is that you don't know the effects of your actions beforehand. So, for at least the first time you see an event, there is an element of guesswork where you have to guess whether or not the thing you intended to happen will happen. Luckily, the game's events are very simple and there isn't a lot (if any) complexity to the story. It also happens to repeat itself a lot. In fact, on my third or fourth playthrough I happened to have already seen most of the events that were offered to me.A positive point is that the game's narration between weeks is atmospheric. Another positive point is that it has very good and fitting music (in my opinion).For these reasons, I would suggest NOT BUYING THIS GAME. Instead, watch someone else play it - you will get the same experience. Watch a run-through if you think that's an exaggeration. Stay away from purchasing game. Look at it, note what it attempts to do and then move on. It is nowhere remotely worth the money (except for the music, which as I said before, is pretty good in my opinion)."

,Recommended,269030,28997787,Posted: 3 January,all,Ticia,"Before purchasing 'The Yawhg', I had thought it to be a light-hearted, ""choose your own story"", game. Yet, what I got instead was infinitely more intriguing.The game itself offers four differentiating characters that the player can control, and in doing so will ultimately decide their own life stories. It's left up to them to improve the skills of the characters, and to make wise decisions; some of which even prove to be a bit of a catch 22.Something that I personally found to be fantastic, about The Yawhg, was that it's intended to be played from just one device. So, I can easily access play by myself, or with my friends. Whether they be online, or right next to me; which is truly brilliant. And whether or not the ""antagonist"" was defeated depended upon ALL of the players. Team work is imperative for the succession of this game.Something else that stood out to me was the violent undertones, and low-key foreshadowing of impending doom, as The Yawhg [a so-called ""storm""] approached its arrival to the town; in which the protagonists live. I'm probably running out of characters here, so I'll try to make this explanation quick. After The Yawhg has said to pass, the players are asked to select one of many professions, in an effort to re-construct the town, and whether or not they do it well depends entirely on how high their corresponding skill is. The Yawhg is just like a giant puzzle. All of the events that take place link to the game's ending, and it can be either good or bad.Will you survive The Yawhg? And even if you do, will you be happy forevermore? Take a chance, and find out."

You send them to a random location, get a random stat increase, which, considering there is no battle system whatsoever, is merely to decide how successful you are at future random stat increases... then 6 turns later, you choose a profession for your character(s), and the game decides if you were lucky enough to merit a happy or sad ending.

I finished four (4) complete playthroughs in under an hour and saw many repeats.More detailed review (based on the singleplayer experience):The Yawhg is not so much a choose-your-own-adventure story (there is very little narrative, and your characters are gamepieces - not people) as it is a short opportunity to build up a couple of characters' stats in a short time to fulfill the game's hidden requirements.  There are four characters from whom to choose, but the only difference among them seems to be the appearance - I didn't notice any difference in events or stats.  As a single player, the game will ask you to choose two to four characters to play, and your goal is to raise their stats (there are six stats: physique, finesse, etc.).For each turn, you will send each character to a place on the map to do a task.  There are eight locations and two possible tasks at each, so sixteen tasks in total from which to choose each turn, but two characters cannot be at the same location at the same time.  Each task will raise or lower one or more of your stats, but the only way to know what a task will affect is through trial and error.  Most tasks will also trigger a short text-based ""event,"" which may allow you to choose your character's response and further affect their stat gain/loss.  To be clear, as a fan of both visual novels and choose-your-own-adventure-type games, the game's systems are *not* the reason I am not recommending it.The problem comes from the fact that the game only consists of six weeks (each turn is a whole week).  This means that you only have six opportunities to raise each character's stats before the Yawhg appears (off-screen) and wrecks the town (again, off-screen).  At that point, you are given a choice of roles for each character to take in the rebuilding process; again, there are no explanations or listed stat requirements, so you just kind of guess.  Finally, the game checks to see if your character's stats are high enough to meet its invisible requirements, and you get a couple of epilogue slides reflecting your characters' success/failure and their fates afterwards.That's it.  Six turns, a guess, and an epilogue.  So, each playthrough is EXTREMELY short to begin with, and then there is the fact that although the game supposedly has something like 100-200 unique events (I'm not arguing that it doesn't), you will see a lot of repeats in each playthrough, so subsequent playthroughs are not as exciting.  When I first played the game, I did 3 full playthroughs: the first using 2 characters, the second using all 4, and the third using 3 just to be thorough.  All 3 playthroughs took me a combined *32 minutes*.  Thinking that maybe I missed something or was in a bad mood that day, I waited some time, then played it once more before posting this review.  Again, maybe 10 minutes, and I'm pretty sure that all but one of the events and the two ending cards were repeats.To finish, I hate to post a negative review for anything, but I just can't recommend this game at its $10 asking price given the dirth of content.  If you can get it for <$5 and plan on playing with friends, by all means go ahead: the art is unique and interesting, the music is nice, and I like the general concept -- there's simply not enough here to keep a person busy for even a single hour (and again, this is from someone who enjoys text- and menu-based games).

On the other hand, it is an interesting and cohesive use of the medium to convey a specific idea. It uses a ""choose your own adventure"" style to allow each character you play to conduct different activities over the course of 6 turns. These activites grant or remove stats, and the stats you have determine how your character responds to different random events. At the end of the game, the stats help determine various outcomes for your character. It's a very, very simple and limited interface. However, the game is less interested in providing a compelling story than it is in demonstrating how the choices we make in life accumulate and ultimately create a story for us that makes sense only in retrospect. The relative meaninglessness of the stats in the game reflects the meaninglessness of our ""stats"" in our lives. At the end of the day, our lives are equally defined by choices and events beyond our control, and these both with have impacts on our lives and also the life of the community we inhabit. In conveying this idea, the gameplay and themes of this game are in perfect harmony and it makes for a memorable experience."

The art is great, the music is divine, and the sheer novelty of experiencing an interactive story with friends is endearing. I definitely recommend this game, but keep in mind that it might not be for everyone.

The gameplay in The Yawhg is incredibly minimal, with the only real player input being what actions the characters take during the six week ingame cycle. The game instead focuses heavily on the story and world interactions your choices create.The in depth details in The Yawhg are astounding with many in-game events big and small, hidden in obscure event pathways, based entirely on the skills you have bult up for your characters.But because of skill and day limitations it may become extremely tiresome for many players to try and see some of the Yawhgs more inner secrets, as they may accidentally trigger a event to occur earlier than they wished, or even a different event than what is wished for to occur.The main thing to keep in mind though when purchasing this game is this: Do you have any friends who live near you?If yes then The Yawhg is a great game to play as its couch co-op focus can make for a fun and eventful time. If not and you also have no means of streaming events to friends and playing that way, you will find yourself playing a game for four on your ownsome, and as fun as the game can be, playing it by yourself can be a very tiresome experience.Basically buy this game if you like fun storytelling and have friends."

The Yawhg is basically a game were up to 4 people (locally)pick a character and go to a location where you choose an action you would like to do for example pickpocketing. When you do the action some of your stats will increase. As well as you doing the action and getting stats for that you will also have a random encounter for example finding some lost townsfolk. These random encounters can decrease or increase your stats. After you choosing six locations in turns (one for every week) the Yawhg will come. After the Yawhg comes and the town is destroyed you have to choose a role such as builder how well you perform these roles will be affected by your stats. After everyone in the game has picked there role and told how well they did at it you will be told if you saved the town and shouldnt have any more issues with the Yawhg(good ending),survived(neutral ending) or if the town stays in ruin's(bad ending). Surprisingly in my opinion the more unique cool ending's(for your character) come if you get the bad ending for the town.All in all The Yawhg is a fun game to play with friends.

Hugely repetitive. This became apparent by my second playthrough and only got worse. Since this is the appeal of the game (it is marketed as 'a one-to-four player choose-your-own-adventure game that randomizes a unique story every time you play' I was disappointed by how repetitive it was, especially given how short each game is).- Some of the story elements are not suitable for younger players but I haven't seen any indication of this on the store front (horror elements, specifically).- While the game is advertised as 'story rich' and with a 'fully fleshed out world' I found it extremely simplistic and shallow in those regards."

,Recommended,269030,19139842,"Posted: 17 November, 2015",all,lexavian,"Quick Summary: a quick mainly text game that is best played locally with 2-4 players. I reccomend it to anyone if the price range is maybe $4-6 or if it ever adds more content.So the Yawhg is a fantasy/fairy tale game where 2-4 players play as one of 4 color themed characters. In each round of the game every player takes a turn before control passes to the next player. In each player's turn there is a particular order or structure to the turn. First the player picks a place to go and picks from one of two pre-set actions for that location. For example the player can go to the ""alchemy tower"" and ""brew potion"" or ""clean lab"".  (They are limited by only being able to choose where no one else has gone yet on that turn.) The game then rewards you a stat bonus for your action (usually +2 to one stat and +1 to another) and then generates a particular scenario based on that selection. You are given a choice during that scenario and the game will tell you how your choice went. The outcome of this choice is frequently dependent on your stats. For example, brewing potions give you +2 magic and +1 mind. After that the game says that the other wizards are thowing a cantrip party (cantrips are low-level easily-cast spells). After hearing what some other people do you can decide to do a ""simple trick"" or ""complex trick"". If you don't have high enough of a magic stat and choose ""complex trick"", you end up hurting and embarrassing yourself in the process which then causes a -2 in charm. However successfully completing the complex trick may have given you rank among your peers in the form of +2 charm. Additionally, these scenarios are interlinked and frequently someone may do something in thier turn that causes another scenario to occur in another players turn. This is seen in the demon baby excerpts from the gameplay demo above. After several round of this ""the yawhg"" arrives. Without going into too much detail, your stats and one final choice determine the outcome of the town in this trying time. The town's fate is delegated to one of 3 options, the best of which is easily obtainable. Then the game gives each player a personal ending which is dependent on the town's ending, the player's stats, thier last choice, how they spent their time, and what scenarios happened to them. For example if you get the good town ending and spent a lot of time doctoring there are at least two specific doctor endings. But if you also happened to encounter a supernatural creature at some point, then you may get an ending where you try to wrap up loose end involving that encounter.In the end, the number of outcomes and scenarios are limited and if you enjoyed the game you are left wishing there was more content to the game. (I particularly want an update or DLC). However, even after 7.5 hours on record playing this game, a new event occurred last time and a new ending. And we have yet to explore any of the towns subpar endings. This is a great game to buy on sale and then whip out to play with family or friends. It has easy intuitive menu and allows for any combination of controllers or keyboards. Players can assign both of thier characters to the same device and then pass the controller between them."

I won't say what the story is, but I will tell you it can be very powerful. The ""Narrative"" you make with other people you play with can shapes how the city looks at the end of the game, and how the characters you played as are affecteds after ""The Yawhhg"" descends upon the city. There are also slightly smaller ""story-archs"" that can occur during play that can effect what happens to other players before ""The Yawhg"" actually appears, such as the baby and  the bard in the gameplay demo. A small problem with this game however is that it isn't playable online exsactly, it's only local co-op where a single controller is used and is handed from one player to the next, but I've seen people play this on Twitch so that their freinds can play with them and see what's happening in game.

I would say Yes, its fun, amusing, and it has this charm and character to it that while having a grounding in maturity and even harsh reality. Easy to understand and depending how many chracters you're using, each game is probably only 15 min long. While its in no way a muliplayer game in the tradition sense, I do feel there is almost this party quality to it, the game more fun when you have a bunch of friends watch, laughing at quirky moments and getting mind crushed when some of the more dark and burtal moments.Its a game that, how my wife put it when she did her first round, feels almost like a mini-table top roleplaying session. Rapidly making choices which, depending on the roll (Or in the Yawhgs case, RNG and Stats) can lead to good and bad outcomes. It also makes people realize that even Good outcomes in one case could actually lead to bad outcome for someone else (An Example of this would be what happens to the Bard in the trailer of the game)Despite all of fun moments, probably the thing that struck me most was how it seemed at times you can do everything right, and still feel like you somehow lost. Like how you an ultimately save the town, but the endings for the character could be so ... normal, maybe even sad. It reminds me of that one qoute Picard says from Star Check (paraphrasing here) ""It is possible to do everything right, but still lose in the end"".Overall, The Yawhg is both fun an experience I would suggest to others. Its charming, is quirky, it can be very dark, and undertone of maturity it pulls off so well. Its the kind of game, no matter how well or bad I did, made me apperciate life a bit more, if that makes any sense."

It's not gonna last long if you play it continously since it does have a pool of options it picks from so you have a chance of encountering the same thing over and over again. But every once in a while it will bllw you away with a new scenario that will either mess your character up or make him something out fo this world. This game can also be played in a group fo 4 people where each one picks a character and you take turns at the pc and try to interract with one another in the ending to see how this will affect everything.

Rather than a party game where you have mindless fun and game, this is a game where you and your friends take on a role and roleplay together. As such, it is a really good roleplay game, where all of the actions have direct or/and indirect consequences and changes the outcome of the game. With every playthrough, every decision and consequences differs, and so every playthrough is unique in it's own way. The art-style is nice, the music (albeit repetitive) suits the mood, the gameplay is simple and engaging, and when played with friends, i have no doubt that it'll be a fun party game, possibly even better when drunk.As a single player game however, it completely lacks any kind of weight. This is the reason why i cannot recommend this to anyone who does not have a friend to play couch co-op with, because that is the only way this game is meant to be played. 0.2 hours is all that it takes for me to finish one playthrough, and that's with me reading every single text. It's really short, really shallow as well, and does not leave a lasting impression. Like i mentioned before, this game is meant to be played with other people, who will contribute their own depths to the story. Playing it alone however, means that there's nothing much to do, except absentmindedly pick choices and read the consequences, alone.I want to love this game, because this kind of game with choices, branching story, consequences that impacts the story, and character building, but there's not enough for me to love about this gameTL;DR if you have someone to go couch co-op with, i would recommend buying it.

This is interactive equivalent of a good bedtime novel.No button smashing, puzzle solving or timer countdown. Just you and your simple decisions.

Instead of yet another game that showers you with blocks of preformatted lines, this is an adventure, two of them. This has an enchantingly human story. The player chooses the course of two lives, how they build, how they grow or how they fail. It's not another high-budget super-graphical story like any of a thousand roleplay games, instead it feels much more like a choose-your-own-adventure story. The music is heartfelt, and the storylines feel involving, despite this being a relatively short game. The closest similarity I could find is with the Stanley Parable, but that does The Yawhg a disservice - the choices for the lives of the characters really do matter and they affect what ultimately happens at the story's end. I found myself really enjoying this - it's rare for a game to have a hand-crafted heartfelt sort of feeling to it, but The Yawhg has this from beginning to end. Excellent. Rare. Interesting."

This one is in the vein of choose your own adventure, ah my childhood, and does a great job at mixing up your choices and making the consequences matter. It hard to say too much about the game is its so short, spoiling how it plays out seems unfair.   You basically can play 1 to 4 people, though you can play any of that amount also by yourself.  You have 8 days to choose what to do. There's 8 to 10 locations in the town and each has 1 of 2 activities.  These don't change but the outcome are highly random and you will have to make choices during each daily action that has a stat effect then and one on the overall outcome of the game.Its brillant, and the music is hauntingly beautiful with it as some of the heart wrenching, funny outcomes.  The fact that i played though it twice in 30 minutes shouldn't disuade you from playing it.

And this is actually a big deal.One of the main draws of the game is using locations around the town to better your stats and wealth before the Yawhg comes. Sounds pretty easy, just have to make some tough decisions. Which is fine. It's good. Except that depending on your monitor, you can't see your base or upgraded stats. And that causes kinks when you actually progress past Week 6, and things get a little more interesting.While over all the lack of different resolutions is mostly cosmetic, it is something to consider and think about before purchasing this game.

Anyway, it's very offbeat yet classic fantasy, but well designed and like all of Emily's work, short-lived but worth going back to later.So if you want a short, beautiful, uncomplicated experience you can get through while you're waiting for your hair to dry, or for your favourite show to download, or dinner to cook, then look no further."

The player still has to think through difficult decisions, sometimes without a right answer to choose from, and the story varies every time it's played. You could make bad decisions early on that affect the whole playthrough, you could ignore your stats and end up with a useless character, or the game could just hate you and force you to fail. Any one of those can give you leeches.Everyone hates the leeches, yet it can be the funniest occurence in the game.I'm not going to spoil anything in this (Says he after warning of leeches), but you can fail, succeed or survive, all of which are based on decisions you make during the initial six weeks and after the Yawhg. You can control the outcome, but sometimes you have to take a chance, do something different, and see what happens.WARNING: This game will either draw you in or make you hate it. I cannot, nor can anyone else, guarantee that you will enjoy it. It's one of those games. Consider yourself warned.I have been anticipating Steam release since this game was launched last year. I very nearly bought it when it was made known that it probably wouldn't make it, but I waited and it arrived. Meanwhile, I have watched hours of gameplay. Yeah, it probably ruined a few of the surprises for me, but I don't mind. I still haven't seen close to all of the endings.---Basically: Get the game, but make sure to watch gameplay videos first.

You really need at least one other player for the game to truly take off, and it works best with a full set.  The joy comes out of everyone's choices and motivations and goals bouncing off everyone else's and providing contrast - puppetmastering everyone for some kind of optimal result just isn't that interesting.  Shame it's local multiplayer only, then, but given how complex netcode can be, it's understandable.In short, get this game if you can drag at least one friend in to play with you in real life.

First, let's discuss it's strengths.The Yawhg is beautiful. The artwork is all fantastic and fits the theme of the game perfectly. The music and soundtrack of the game is haunting and wonderful. The gameplay is interesting and, at first, exciting. The story is enjoyable and satisfying.And now, the negative sides of the game. It's short. Not such a bad thing, but when coupled with the retail price, the sense of worth is a little low. I got 80 minutes of gameplay out of the game, which I did enjoy, though the price is a little high for my taste.  Next up, again, the gameplay. After one or two playthroughs of the game, the mechanics are no longer exciting as you can kind of see what's happening quite easily, meaning completion of the game can be easily ""gamed"" (if you know what I mean). The game also lacks achievements. Woah woah wait, that's not a bad thing right? Actually, I think in this case, it is. Achievements mean nothing, it's true, but I think, had The Yawhg had achievements, it would have added a heck of a lot more replayability as the achievements could direct your play, asking you to complete sub-stories, professions, and multiple side ideas which, after completion, many will not revisit.Either way, a really charming and lovely game.

The game is essentially for 1-4 players, each taking their turn of where to go during the week, what to do at said location, and how you respond to a random event. This process lasts for several weeks, around 6 or 8 I believe, before the ""Yawhg"" comes. After the Yawhg comes, the game sums up your ending randomly. While fun, witty, and comedic, the ""adventure"" that players go through is drastically short and is merely based on week to week events rather than the accumulative story. For $9.99 I would say the game is extremely short (lasting around 5-15 minutes depending on how fast you can read) and I would recommend it as a nice steam summer sale pick up. Other positive notes include pretty artwork, interesting scenarios, and a short-lived entertaining adventure game. I would give it a 5 out of 10."

The Yawhg really does separate itself from others as a, while short, superbly structured and presented piece.While I can't say whether the full price is worth it; I do very much recommend playing this with a group of friends to share the stories you create with them. It is truly a heart-warming experience."

But, as with all multiplayer games, it's a much better experience with other people.One thing I would like to see in the future (if this game will be updated), though, is online multiplayer, for when you can't find anyone in real life who have the time to play it with you but you have a few friends on steam who have the game and are willing to play it with you.Here's to ""The Yawhg"", and may it do well as a game that everyone will (hopefully) love.

But, The Yawhg is without a doubt a visual storytelling experience that anyone who enjoys 'choose your own adventure' novels or games will love. The gameplay is minimal, you choose two to four characters (best suited for multiplayer, maybe) and choose where they will spend their single week of six. In these six weeks, the Yawhg, a mythical beast who never shows it's face to the player, will attack the town and destroy everything you've become familiar with. Because the actual weeks pass by in maybe 15 minutes, multiple playthoughs are a must. And hard to resist. You can choose to spread out your experience, attacking everything to do, or you can grind out your magic, charm, mind, and so forth at one location six weeks in a row. However, the multiple endings find a way to beat your system faster than you learned to cheat theirs. Spending time bartending for charm, you end up an alcoholic, dead from your own love. Grinding out magic at the alchemist tower leaves you alone, without love, and left to create potions to satisfy your only happiness. This is where the Yawhg becomes a ""beautiful"" experience. Albeit depressing, the levels of endings you can receive give you a feeling that you did what needed to be done. There is no need for guides, builds, playing a game the way you don't usually play just so you can have a completionist ending or a successful character stat build. This is a game that is relentless in experience that you learn on your own, and that you can only experience if you treat it like a real week by week lifestyle. This is your story to create, and it's a doozy."

Every day you gather stats by visiting many locations of the city, with an immense amount of different things that can happen.  After 6 weeks you choose what you want to do with those skills you`ve garnered, and depending on them, you decide the towns fate.The main meat of the game however are the immense amount of different endings. You might have angered someone you shouldn`t have during the 6 weeks. You might have decided to do something you really shouldn`t have at the end. Maybe you turn into a monster yourself! ...Or maybe you live mostly an ordinary life.The game in itself is best when played as a group. The game allows up to 4 players to go live in the town. The games biggest downfall is the fact, that it doesn`t support online multiplayer, but that is easily fixed with a call with skype as one person reads the choices out loud and does the choices for the other players like a game master.Overall, if you want a fun experience, which most likely gives you an unique ending everytime if you aren`t afraid to try something new, and you like reading, buy the game."

It's short enough that you can get through the whole thing in one sitting and immediately want to do it all over again to try different scenarios; it's also just long enough that it feels as though what you decide has some impact on the world and you can even see some far-reaching, unexpected consequences down the line.

It is sort of a multiplayer choose-your-own-adventure game. Each person chooses a character and then chooses where they want to spend one of their 6 weeks before the Yawhg arrives. The beuty lies in the amount of variation you can get therein. Will you stay at the bar and get drunk all week? Will you go to the palace and dance the nights away? Will you don a mask and fight crime in the back alleys for the slums? All these options are available to you.After choosing what you will be doing that week, a small story is told to you for that week, maybe while fighting crime you meet someone who turns you into a vampire! Maybe during your work at the hospital hundreds of leeches break free! While they are limited, the story elements of each location are different from each other and highly entertaining. During the story part, your stats will change (Physique, Mind, Magic, Finesse, etc). These will be important after the Yawhg arrives.The most interesting thing about the story elements is that they have a chance of crossing over to other areas. If the aformentioned leeches break free from the hospital, they may spill over into the slums! Or maybe even the lake! The dryad you met in the woods may show up in the arena! The combinations are truely interesting and make the game even more fun to explore.After the Yawhg arrives, you are tasked to rebuild by taking on one of many important (or not so important) roles around the town. Will you band the remaning townsfolk together and lead? Will you try to use your might to build? Will you use your magical aptitued to brew potions? Beware, though, because if you do not have the proper stats (gained from the story parts of the game) you will fail in your attempt to help, and you will hinder the rebuilding.After everyone has chosen a role they are given their last story segment and you are told if the town will press on after the Yawhg or if it will ultimately fall to ruin.I would like to see more stories added or mod support so that the community could add their own stories.The game is overall fun for a group of friends, and trying to get the best ending can be challanging and a true team effort.

,Recommended,269030,11018278,"Posted: 2 July, 2014",all,This Puny Human,"For those who enjoy board games, the Yawhg feels familiar. Averything happen in turns and random events, shaping your character's evolution and leading to their sucess or failure at the conclusion.Things to keep in mind if you want to buy this game:1- It's really short. Really, really short. Takes about 7 turns to finish one gameplay.Then you get the conclusion and can start again. Since events are random, you'll probably find new things when playing for the second (and third, fourth, etc) time, but things start to repeat soon.2- It's best if played with friends. Not online, but at your side, using the same computer. You can have up to four players and I could only have real fun with The Yawhg after I invited others to play with me. Like I said before, very similar to a board game.With that in mind, chances are you won't be surprised and will end up having fun. The visuals and songs are really well done too. It's not worth a lot of money and I think would be best as a Ipad game, but it's a nice idea. Not for everyone, though. Makes me wish they would release an expansion, with more events, locations, etc. As it is now, I fear is way too short and might get repetitive too soon. Still, I had fun, and that's what counts."

First off, no online co op mode, which is weird to want but this would have been perfect for my friends and I to play over skype. The game gives you four characters to choose from, all very unique and different. You have six weeks before this ""Yawhg"" decends onto the world. Each turn you get to choose where your character decides to spend their week. Once you make a choice you then choose between two paths and two paths again, you get text for what your character does within these branching paths but this is the formula it sticks with. You gain (or lose) stats depending on your decisions. Once the six weeks are up the Yawhg appears and you have some choices after it does appear. At this point your characters stats and your own choice determine whether the characters and towns fate is positive or negative.For the price I can't complain, I really need to try some of the other paths.

This doesn't mean it's bad - it's quite good - but know what you're getting into when you buy it.  Basically it's a smart visual novel game for parties.Two to four characters make choices, lead lives, and prepare as a strange threat - the Yawhg - approaches.  Doing things raises character stats and affects other elements of the game.  A magical experiment, a won gladiatorial event, an undifused bomb, all affect other characters.  When the disaster does happen, characters then choose their path after, which affects the end of the game.Gameplay is pretty short - the game is meant to be replayed.  Graphics are decent, and the storybook look really works.  Music is great.So the question on buying it is ""do you want an experimental multiplayer story game.""  If you do, this is for you.  Otherwise, its not for you - but I consider it a good game."

I honestly never found a game focused on the story that had a level this high of rejogability and story based games are my favorite ones! I played this game dozens and dozens and dozens of times with my auntie, my cousin and my sister - sometimes other guests but mostly them - and I saw dozens and dozens and dozens of variations of events and endings to the point of thinking ocasionally that I finally had found everything that had to be found there but I always had the pleasant surprise of discovering that I was very mistaken. To this day, I still don't doubt that there things I didn't saw in that game even though I played it A LOT(my hours may indicate that).The Yawgh is a mostly story based game but its drawings have a beautiful style with lovely colours and together with its soundtrack, they create the perfect atmosphere for the tale of the seven days of some townies before the Yawgh comes to destroy it.Btw, there's NOTHING you can to stop the Yaghw of coming. This is one of the points in which the story starts to differ of the classical RPGs we all know. Your objective is to obtain points in certain habilities by going to places with random events during every week until everything is destroyed and you can finally put your talents in a good use(or not, there's a bad and a medium ending after all!).Each event is written very well and there's A LOT of them and EVEN MORE variations of it according to not only your habilities but also some events that might happened during others players turns! The random events of this game sometimes get connections and form a little story line, which is freaking awesome. If you poisoned the water in week 02, there's a great chance that you and your friends will see some consequences of it in different locations during the rest of the game. In some cases, the random events can even affect directly your ending!Another wonderful, AWESOME thing about this game is the fact that there's not only the ""Town's ending"" - that can be great, medium or bad - but there's also a individual ending to each player based on their actions during the game, how they contributed to the rebuilding of the town and also how much the city recovered. If you get a great town ending, you may get a happy and amazing ending! If you don't, believe me, things can get a extremely dark turn.The only thing that is sad is the fact that we can't play it in online multiplayer mode but oh well. This is a great game to play alone and with local friends!This is one of the best games that I ever played and I still hold it in my heart(and play everytime I meet someone who doesn't know it).10/10!"

Screensharing was not an option at that moment in time, as some of them were using their phones, but that did not take away from the fun and... odd enjoyment that we recieved whilst playing it.This game has fantastic music, which I fell in love with, and an art style which is hard not to instantly adore.

If you have seven pounds lying around, then get this game. Do not hesitate in the slightest.If (or when) you decide to buy this game, do not forget that Emily Carrol has not written infinite possibilities of what could happen during a playthrough. Often, you'll come across an instance that you rememeber from your first playthrough, or your fifth, or tenth. However, this does not take away from the charm that this game has to offer.After two play throughs with a group of friends, they unleashed killer rats, deadly leeches and poisoned the towns water supply, all having effects throughout the week.A game like this should be enjoyed thoroughly, but in small doses. If you are fine with repeating occurances, then good on you, play this to your hearts content and find enjoyment in remebering the good and bad that WILL happen to you.However, if you are like myself, then it will be best to play this game once or twice every few weeks.I will never regret buying this game, even if I can memorise every occurance in every location..

The visuals are quaint and a little cutesy, as is the music which stands as its own thing. The gameplay is incredibly simple, just having you choose where to go on a map, and what activity to do there. You're then ushered through an event which results in a decision which will affect the stats your character builds, and over the few turns your character will grow and be left with a final choice.The Yawhg never feels disappointing or like you've failed to experience a story, despite its very short playthrough length. It leaves you with a good ending that is based on what you did in the the days before the return of The Yawhg.On the whole I would recommend this to people who are interested in that kind of concept - Tabletop RPG players who might have a quick playthrough with a couple of friends.

It's nice they didn't always make it terribly obvious what was going to happen or what stats you would need in order to have a 'successful' result when making a choice. I liked the art and loved the music.What I Didn't Like: Each play-through is pretty quick, even using all 4 characters - about 10-15 minutes. After 45 minutes of playing, I felt I had seen 80% of the ""event triggers"" if that makes sense, and was ready to play something else for the time being.Overall: I found the game to be really enjoyable as well as relaxing.

Whatever works for you.I have replayed this game with many different friends and enjoyed their reactions to the unusual scenarios it threw at them, especially when seemingly minor decisions come back to haunt them. It's a very short game but lasts just as long as it needs to. Soundtrack and visual style work perfectly. Only criticism is the lack of online multiplayer."

Then this is the game for you.The Yawgh consists of a number of turns where you decide which part of town you go to, and then decide how you will approache that event and then resolve it before the""Yawgh"" happens. It's somewhat a graceful throwback to text based games which too much effort thrown into the ""feel"" of the game, rather than focus on making the events more vast and random, often after playthrough number three you will see many of the same ""Haunting"" events that disinterested you in the first couple of playthrough's. It is somewhat interesting to where your character ends up at the end of the game, but not interesting enough to make you want to play it a fifth time.The Yawgh is perfect for a group of four friends with nothing better to do than to play a random game or watch Space Jam."

The music fits the game perfectly, it's easy for people who have never played to pick it up and enjoy it, it's like a quick, bite sized DnD session.  I wish there were more party games like this."

I bring it to parties all the time and 4 players at a time get to have a great short roleplaying game, only issue is after a handful or two of playthroughs you will see events you have seen before."

Although it does begin to repeat after a certain amount of playthroughs. It is very interesting to play with a group but gets annoying that the order never changes so people going last never get their choice.I also have run into multiple problems getting it working when trying to get it to run in anything other than fullscreen. (Also problems with big picture).That being said it was definitely worth the money and worth the few playthroughs."

,Recommended,269030,29815087,Posted: 9 February,all,TieKuhn,"The Yawhgis one of those games where you can see great potential for a party setting. When brought into a party setting however, you find plenty of room for laughs all around as each person(or groups of people if you decide to have characters run democratically) encounters the day to day life before encountering the Yawhg. The unpredictable nature of when certain scenarios will occur, and the probability of having correct scores when these great events arise allow for experimentation with each playthrough. The games taking about 20 minutes, this gives the game great versatility in the party setting. I truly recommend this game to anyone who is often looked to as the bringer of party games during grand rendevous, and those who find games that require multiple ways of thinking quite intriguing. So step into the adventure as blue, red, yellow, or green as you prepare for the coming of the Yawhg."
76561198277795791,Recommended,269030,29793996,Posted: 8 February,all,ArgentRabe,This game is the perfect game to just sit down with irl friends and have fun. The story and art is beautiful. Each run through takes about half an hour but it is always fun. If you have friends then this is a great choice.

I wish they would add generally more options and story, but the few fresh-feeling playthroughs was definetly worth the price. I love the art style because it reminds me of Don't Starve and The Marvellous Misadventures of Flapjack; so down-to-earth and cozy."

76561197989683828,Recommended,269030,30248182,Posted: 28 February,all,Cristovelli,"Interesting and different casual choose-your-own-adventure story with multiplayer. Seems fixed at 1280x720 resolution. Some nice art, and unique folk music soundtrack that sets the mood. This is not a good singleplayer game, nor really a good party game if you are seeking thrills. It is however a good game to play with your girlfriend who is not so good at fast-paced or busy action games, but who still wants to play games with you.Recommended if you need a casual non-competitive game to play with someone. But not really for kids unless you are fine with some of the more gruesome and sad outcomes depicted. Not a lot of bells and whistles though. Very niche type of game, also overpriced for what it is. Get on sale, or part of a bundle, maaaybe worth $5 but really more like $3."

I wish that the disaster the Yawhg brings would vary and that characters had more options in the aftermath, but this game is still definitely worth looking at."

,Recommended,269030,34391597,Posted: 21 August,all,MangaEngel,"While playable alone, ALWAYS play this with friends. Play it online or locally, doesn't matter.It is a multiplayer where only one copy is needed, so buy it and enjoy a fun little storytime with your friends.Graphics:Beautiful handdrawn images, always with small variations depending on which character is currently active.Music:Calm and non-distracting, perfect to allow one (or multiple) player to read the story out loud.Gameplay:It is simple and yet amazing. Up to four players live in town and can choose one of various locations where a random event will play. Each event allows two possible reactions which may or may not lead to a longer story down the road. Does the event work out or fail? Your stats will define your success which can be raised by visiting certain places and doing certain actions.And when the Yawgh has come, will you help to save the town or lead it to it's doom for selfish reasons?According to the creators, it takes about 120 hours to see EVERY event, so be ready for a lot of fun sessions!Other:The game is as dark as it is funny.Have a sex orgy with orcs, destroy a hospital as a werewolf, win a singing contest or drink the wine of the king. Would you rather drink a burning potion or simply swing it out the window? And when a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ offers you a nice evening, will you go with her or leave her to her own devices?But be aware, your choices can matter more than you think and you might find the town being overrun by rampant monster plants or find yourself becoming an addicted drunk in the sewers."
