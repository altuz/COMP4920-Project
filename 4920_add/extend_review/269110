And when I went to get upgrades there were no tooltips, no flavor text, only generic names and a set of boxes for each upgrade. It just felt empty.Also the world feels too bright, this might just be an effect of playing on a high resolution, but it kind of ruins the atmosphere  for me.Other than that, They did a good job with the music and the fact that you can co-op (even though it's only local right now) is sure to be a big plus if you happen to have someone to play it with.This saddens me, and I hope in the future they will do something to the game to make me want to give it another shot because it's such a good game and I know they can do better than this."

,Recommended,269110,9436984,"Posted: 12 March, 2014",all,Toyoch,"(日本語レビューはしたのほう)I've played loads of Motherload since the original flash version, and been waiting for the release. I also backed it on KS(though it failed).I was sad by the early PS4 release and later PC release on this game, but it worthed a wait.You do the digging for resources, sell them and upgrade your digger. Deeper you go, richer resources found.It contains more puzzles than the original, requiring you to plan your routes, and use of bombs(Dynamite, TNT, Shaft Bomb, etc) for better profit and faster progress.If you dig resources in certain order(or combo), you get more profit. like ""Platinum + Iron"" = Rare Earth Magnet and is worth 2500, which is far more than those resources dug alone. These combos are unlocked with Smelter upgrades.Be careful with terrains(landing/hitting hard will damage you) and fuels to stay alive. on death you'll lose collected minerals on that run(on normal, Hardcore sounds like a permadeath but haven't tried yet).There are several characters and some unlockables have different stats than 4 main characters. Upgrades are saved on them except Radar upgrade which is tied to the world save. So, if you're stuck just go ""New Game"" with your previous character(You only lose radar upgrade but the world is renewed, so it won't be too hard to re-upgrade it).I know it's in Early Acecss, but there's stuttering problem on my computer. Particles and stuffs are not too optimized yet it seems.It has multiplayer, but LOCAL only. And the game is designed for local multiplayer(with shared screen and stuffs). If it really had online multiplayer, it would be instantly GOTY, <b>all the time</b> for me.9/10, -1 from performance issues and no online multiplayer. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.The Good:- Dig, Sell, Upgrade. simple and fun.- Still faithful to the original- Good controls(with Xbox360 pad).The Bad:- Performance problem- Radar could be bigger on singleplayer(or non-4 player games)-------------------------前作(2004年)Motherloadに凄くはまってた私は、この続編に凄く期待していたしKickstarterに寄付もしてた(失敗したが)。PS4版のリリースが先で、PC版がかなり後になるという話はうれしくなかったけど、待つ価値はあった。基本は「資源を採掘＞資源を売却＞その金でアップグレード」を繰り返し、火星の奥深くまで突き進んでいく。前作よりもパズルめいた地形が生成されることが多くなり、ルート構築(前作と同じく、上へ掘ることはできないし空中採掘もできない)や各種爆弾の使用を考える必要もある。資源を特定の組み合わせで掘ると、コンボとしてより高価な資源が手に入る(例：プラチナ+鉄=レアアースマグネット、2500の価値)。溶鉱炉(Smelter)をアップグレードすると使えるコンボの種類が増える。ダメージバランスは前作より厳しく、落下以外にも横方向や上方向に強くぶつかってもダメージを食らうので注意。ノーマルなら死んでも今持っている資源を失うだけですむが、ハードコアはワールドセーブが消されるのではないかと思われる。キャラクターは初期４人＋アンロック数人といて、アンロックキャラは初期とは異なるアップグレード上限と特殊能力を持っている。アップグレードはキャラクターごとに保存されるが、レーダーだけはワールドセーブに保存される。資源を採掘しつくすか詰んだ場合は「New Game」で前のキャラを使えば、レーダー以外のアップグレードはそのままでプレイできる(レーダーアップグレードもそこまで高くないので、すぐに買いなおせる)。早期アクセスだからバグやその辺は仕方ないかもしれないが、頻繁に動作が重くなる。その辺の改善を期待。マルチプレイヤーが目玉要素として挙げられてるが、ローカル限定なので注意。ゲームデザインもローカル前提なのでほぼ絶望的だが、オンラインマルチが実装されたら永年人に薦められそうな名作と評価してた。パフォーマンスとオンラインマルチ不可と言う点で減点して9/10。超オススメ。良いとこ:- 採掘・売却・アップグレード。わかりやすく楽しい。- 前作の雰囲気とスタイルそのまま。- 操作感良好(箱○パッドでプレイ)悪いとこ:- パフォーマンス問題- レーダーもう少し大きくして欲しかった"

Unfortunately super Motherload simply lacks the charm and emotion of the original flash game. It just doesn't elicit the same response. Before I get to the negatives I have to say I quite like the aesthetic of the game... Mostly. There are still some aspects of its style that I'm not too keen on, but it can pass. Now what really pisses me off is death. It never bloody happens! When I remember playing the original I remember getting so aggravated because I didn't keep track of how much fuel I had left and blew up half way to the surface. This doesn't happen here. You just can't drill, and because of that you don't even have to keep track of your fuel. And that was part of the fun of Motherload, getting a good way into the game and stupidly killing yourself after going thousands of feet down, losing all of the stuff you managed to collect because you stupidly forgot to save. You don't get that here. My other problem is with the upgrades. Simply put, they're absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥and completely soulless. Part of the fun  of Motherload was having to save up to buy the energy shield hull that you've been eyeing up through half of the game of the jag engine, or whatever. But you don't have that in super Motherload, just a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing upgrade bars. No pictures or dumb names, it's boring and far too serious. Probably the thing I miss the most about the original was the feeling of depth. Every time you needed to refuel or buy upgrades you had to go to the surface and to drop down you had to have dug a path this meant falling thousands of meters and seeing through all the colourful layers, it was awesome, and that sense of depth just can't be felt in super Motherload because of all the bloody bases. Maybe as a standalone title, I could have a more fair review, but as a fan of the original flash game I just can't recomend this."

As you get to the bottom you'll find it almost impossible to get minerals without spending more money on bombs than what the minerals you mine are worth.2. The further I got to the bottom the more my game crashed. Quite annoying considering the time it takes to exhaust cargo and fuel is about 30 mins at the point where I rage quit this game.3. 6 million dollars for the ability to detonate bombs in mid air?

Those features are certainly useful for making money though, since earning in this game seems way harder than the original one.I picked it up during a sale for a bit less than $1.5, so I can't really complain.

Super Motherload is pretty much the same core gameplay as the original, with more polish.You pilot a mining bot that can drill downward and side-to-side but not upward. The resources you gather can be used to upgrade your bot's drill speed, fuel tank size, cargo room, etc. allowing you to drill deeper and deeper thus getting more valuable resources. Eventually you can drill deep enough to get to the core and there is an end 'boss' that you fight using dynamite and other consumables. This all may sound somewhat simple but the game is a lot of fun.The addition of local co-op makes for an easy to pickup game to play with friends. You do have to coordinate though to not let anyone get stuck by moving too far ahead.-Playtime-It really depends on your own pacing and how fast you try to push toward the core. Likely a good 6 hours to beat on a first playthrough. Subsequent play throughs can be done in only 1-2 hours if rushing.-Achievements-Basically just beating the game with each of the characters. Once you understand the game mechanics subsequent play throughs go much quicker."

Smotherload uses textbook skinner box incremental numbers to keep you playing, but it does it so well and so flawlessly that you barely notice. For once, making those numbers go up is truly fun. It's FUN.Too bad it only has a lifespan of about 2 hours, and very little replay value.Motherload is a pseudo-rogue-like game where you dig down down down and collect ores ores ores in a randomized crust of minerals on Mars. Sell the ores, upgrade your miner, mine more ores, sell more ores, upgrade more parts untill youre strong enough to dig to the core and uncover a conspiracy. It's great, incremental gameplay with a solid ending.The game plays like butter, which is strange because there is not really any call for tight controls in this game (apart from the pitiful boss fight). The game is all about thinking laterally and not getting greedy. In the original motherload the entire point of the game was not to get greedy, because there is SO much ore to collect that it blinds you to your health and fuel reserves. So many gems and minerals... calling for you. You can spare the fuel to go get that last ruby right? No, wrong. Stop it.The game expands it's lifespan via randomly generated puzzles that spawn under the surface, you have to think long and hard about how to get the valuable gems without blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up and causing them to be unattainable forever, it's rewarding gameplay and a good player can use them to help speed up the grind. Unfortunately the game hits a wall only 1 hour into gameplay. After the first hour of solid fun, the game turned into a long, wet fart as I grinded ores to upgrade my miner to get to the bottom, at which one of the stupidest boss fights was waiting for me.If you played the original motherload you'll want to get this. There are no longer random deaths from gas pockets, running out of fuel doesnt make you explode anymore (seriously what was even with that?) and it's a lot harder to die. These changes go together to make a much better feeling game... it also kind of took away the challenge, somewhat. The game is not very hard. I'm glad the changes were made, but not enough was added to make the game's difficulty curve up.At the end of the day though, I was enamored by this game, it's short and♥♥♥♥♥♥in spots, but the gameplay, the story and even the graphics are wonderful. If it were any longer it would be in danger of being far too grindy. I'm sure this game could have been far better, but as it stands, it is still a fantastic way to waste an afternoon.11/10 would drill again."
,Not Recommended,269110,9745229,"Posted: 6 April, 2014",all,Tande P,"I have not died once playing this game so far.the graphics, music and overall presentation is actually stunning, and the controls are really smooth and nice, but it all falls apart on one single mistake; when you're out of fuel, nothing happens.In the original web browser game, an empty fuel tank resulted in death, which meant that going deeper to find more valuable resources was riskier, but more rewarding for the player. Now, all that happens is that your spaceship/drilling machine just goes a bit slower than usual and you cant mine anymore until you fill your tank again. You could die from taking to much damage by slamming to hard into the walls, but even that suffers from this puzzling game designing choice.In the original game, an almost empty tank meant time pressure, which resulted in that you had to get faster to the surface in order to not die, while still managing to not kill yourself my slamming into walls as you go faster. Here, that element is completely gone! You can take all the time you want in the world to be as careful as you like, which make everything a slow paced uninteresting grindfest.Its truly sad, that this one little mistake of leaving this mechanic out just completely breaks an otherwise fantastic remake of the original. As ive already said the graphics are awesome, and hints to a soviet union space rocket type of style and the warm red against the cold green are excellent use of color palette. The soundtrack is also really nice and marries the estethics and story into a great feeling game. I highly suggest that the developers release an update where the empty-tank-death mechanic has been reimplemented, as i see here that im not the only one complaining about it. Couldnt be to hard to do could it?"

A few new features peaked my interest, and I managed to get through to the ending within a couple of sessions.Up sides were that the game seemed pretty polished, and I feel I missed out by only playing solo. The story had me interested as I delved deeper, intrigued to see how it developed. As a resources hoarder in other similar games, I was given ample ability to hoard and upgrade to my heart's content.The downside however was that 'developed' seems to be a word that was a little lacking in the game as a whole. The ending seemed half baked, and I couldn't help but feel like the interesting item combining system basically devolved into a much simpler mechanic than it could have been. I didn't feel that mentally exercised by it, and my early hopes were left feeling a bit flat.Overall, if you enjoyed Motherload as a casual time killer, this will probably give you the nostalgia you're hoping for. Otherwise however, don't expect to get much more than an afternoon or two out of this before it joins your other 'I'll play this if I'm bored' titles in your steam library.Also, being totally petty... I kinda miss the different names for upgrades (ruby drill, diamond drill etc), this version having a 'it's this many levels good at digging' alternative."

Thats not too bad, plenty of games function fine local like Magicka and Gauntlet. I feel Super Motherload behaves the same in that aspect, especially with controllers (Plays best with gamepad, Comrade!). The game also seems to lack in content to me but thats remedied by the high replay value. Honestly, thats the only real downside I see and I feel they can easily make it online multiplayer and may even be planning on it.Many complain about the game being too easy and actively ignore hardcore mode or complain about the storyline and how its different from the original. Of course it is, they don't want it to get stale.The graphics are improved of course and I LOVE how it has clever little puzzles that you can solve with different bombs. Nothing feels better that getting a Universe Chain of unobtainium.My brother liked the smelter, I didn't care for it too much.The transmission cutscenes are fully voiced and I absolutely loved that.Honestly, this is one of those games where if you like this type of game but you don't like Super Motherload, its your own damn fault. Many complain about broken textures or black screen and say the GAME is bad for that.

It shows once again how great Xgen is.How the game ImprovesThe game improves in numerous ways besides removing death from running out of fuel. (Still on of the best improvements) The new smelter and combo feature just made the game feel more fun. Now instead of just digging up random minerals, It makes you want to dig up minerals in a certain order, as well has harvest chains of minerals. Speaking of which, the ground isn't exactly random anymore. Now you can somtimes find caverns, whole motherloads of resources, tunnels making different shapes, and puzzles. Yes, there are now puzzles. You can sometimes find special areas with valuable resources that are blocked by a puzzle, which you must solve by bombing it a certain way. This made the game have much more to it then just digging. But you can't just carelessly bomb the puzzle to get to the center. Instead you get more bomb types. Bombs can also be made underground while mining. The world feels much deeper than the last game. To solve this there are now underground stations to make mining easier. No more long trips back to the surface!Story:Im not supprised that the story is much better because they hired a proffesional comic book writer to do their story. Still, it is fantastic! Much better than having a boss who's name is satan when spelled backwards. LIke the last game you are sent to Mars. This time you are working for the Solaris corporation in an alternate cold war era as the minerals have almost run out on Earth. Within the first year of business, connection with Earth was lost after it was sabatoged by rouge miners. The story progresses as you dig deeper with fully voice acted transmissions.

First I felt that it was confusing to try and start new games and switch characters but mabye that was just me. Second, I had issue's with the key configurations. I wanted to swith movement to WASD. Everytime when I would open the game again, the keys would'nt save. It was a bit annoying to keep switching everytime I would start. When It comes to the game, I just felt like the game progressed a bit to fast. I also felt some upgrades were insanely expensive. But thats pretty much it.Final thoughts.Xgen did a very good job at the sequel. It improves in so many ways and has so much more meaning. It's very well suiting for their console launch. I doesn't hurt to buy this game, it's worth it9.5/10"

First of all the start of the game is rather overwhelming in that there's so many blocks at once, which of many can't be destroyed which is very annoying (in a larger extent than the original). Furthermore  the upgrade screen is a major downstep as you can't skip upgrades or see the numbers to an upgrade (I want to know how many litres different tanks hold, how fast different drill speeds are etc). There's also no way (at least I found none) to open your inventory to overlook what you're carrying and also to drop certain ores. You take much more damage from crashing in Super Motherload than in the original, and it really is annoying to have to micromanage every foot you travel, both going down AND up.There are some quests and the first half of the game is decent gameplay this way, although the Quest-boxes being invulnerable initially (as in before you knew what they were) was yet another confusing element. As you approach the end game you come to the realization that there really aren't many high end resources available as you'd expect when you go really deep, and even to the end the world is dominated by mid-tier resources.And then you decide to go all the way down there anyways despite being unable to farm enough to max out all your upgrades. You have no idea what the boss is going to do and perhaps die a few times (it will one-shot you in phase 2 as well). You respawn at the station, which means you're in for 5 minutes or so of really boring travel just to have another go at it.In sumary, the game it really does feel underwhelming in terms of content, as the asking price is 14.99€. The quests were decent, but there's only three of them! The game should definitely be at least twice as long. There defeinitely could be much more imaginative upgrades available late game; being able to drill through different kinds of previously invulnerable materials for example. There should be more kinds of ores and generic (fuel, drill speed etc) upgrades available.At least you don't have to deal with the earthquakes from the original in this one, but the original still reigns supreme by far in comparison because of the reasons above, and because it's free."

With adding chains, combos, special items such as turning magma into cold-hard cash, and unlockable characters(The first four share the same unlocks, the locked characters have things like take no hull damage), there's more to do in Super Motherload. It also doesn't have some of the bugs that plagued even the Goldium Edition(I vibrated off into unmined territory. While hilarious, it was confusing also).Super Motherload still keeps core what Motherload established. It's a puzzle digging game where you get copious amounts of cash for digging. It feels almost exactly like the old one, with the addition of looking pretty and having a solid soundtrack. Althoguh the game on the normal difficulty is a lot easier than the original game, the Hardcore difficulty is...actually difficult. God save you if you explode three layers in the setiment and then have to select a new character(THE MAP DOESN'T REGENERATE ORES because you gotta man up sometimes).If you're a fan of the old Motherload, it's totally worth the asking price. This is keeping in mind that I never was able to co-op with anyone also, since it IS local co-op only. That is the only fault with this one, really. And maybe that the difficulty ranges from baby to death."

This game however, leaves alot to be desired.Let's start with the positives. Graphicly, this game is a big step-up from it's older flash cousin. It has a smooth and clean look that suits it well.The voice acting is not gonna win anyone an award or anything, but is professionally done.As for the negatives... Oh boy. This game does a astonishingly bad job at explaning the properties of the different obstacles you encounter. An example: early on you will encounter ""X"" blocks. The game tells you to build a plasma bomb to get rid of them.. ok? So how do I build it? Sure, you could google that sh!t, but I feel like the average user can't be asked, myself included.The consumables shop is gone, so you're forced to salvage the upper layers in order to progress, which I found to be extremely tedious. The shop lacks any kind of tooltip to indicate how much different upgrades help you.I bought this game hoping for Motherless 2.0, but got the 0.5 instead. if you're looking for the same I advice you to continue looking (or just play the original game)"

You dig down, gather treasures, come back up to sell the treasures, use the money to refuel and upgrade, go deeper and faster than ever before and that last part sounded like the description of a porn. It was not.In reality you will dig down, go ""ooh, gold, I'll get that!"", then run out of fuel and die. Die, die, die!Beyond that basic premise this polished new version of the old flash game, ""Motherload"", is a competent and addictive timewaster. So far I haven't managed to beat it, so I won't give the story a score due to not knowing how it finishes, but I am guessing the finale will be similiar to the old flash game. Basically: the story is filler, designed to add a bit of flavor to the solid core gameplay.The music is fine and good, even catchy in some places, the voice acting is a bit of a 'meh' and the sound of your driller is fine enough. As your game sessions get longer, you might end up turning up your own music instead, as the game doesn't offer anything too exciting in the audio department after a while.Visually the game is simplistic, but funcitonal.

You ""explor"" the inner from Mars by digging your way into it. By getting stuff like gems and ores, you can Level up/ upgrate your Digger like more Full or can store more gems and stuff like. Its nicely made and the only (more or less) enemy is how greedy you are coz you only can DIG left, right and down and NOT up. Of course you can go back up coz your lil digger has helicopter wings too, so no problem to fly back and go back digging.But what IS the problem about the game feel....""lush""?Im honest, i only played it single player and had a good time with it but it feels like i just digged around like an idiot, searching the best ores and gems and...well...thats pretty much it. Good 2/3 of the game you just dig around till youre close to the middle of the Planet Mars, where anyhow the fun ended. Suddendly a lot really bugging things blocking your way like magma- and steelblocks you cant pass or only do by taking a huge % of dmg. the next problem is that I had to srs go back and clear up the sh*t i stored with my digger coz even a full upgrated store-place let you only carry 50 ores at the same time - and at the end you srs NEED to store more.""Why that?"" you may ask, ""arent 50 gems/ores not enough?"" Hehehehe - NO. There we come to the last 1/3 of the game, grinding. At the end it gives, and it is the ONLY one (ok lik ein the original but still), a END-Boss whom you need to deal dmg too. The problem is the whole game is about ""digging"" so it gives absolutly NO REAL weapon in this game (which makes it still weird looking for me if you see this ""Boss fight"" comming~). So what you have to do? The only way (as much as i know) is to ""bomb"" the sh*t out of the Boss and how you do that? With Bombs of course. So the problem is that you more or less need HUGE bombs which COSTS more of course - so where the grinding begins - and it sucks at the end coz of those magma sh*it and what not which bugs and blocks ALL possible ways. And it also slows the game a lot more down at the end: Where you simply can dig around the first areas you get pretty slower keeping forward at the end places where those stuff srs just bug you and you only get the GOOD stuff down there coz you need it to effort the high prices of the bombs.Got that?As i said i played ONLY the Singleplayer so i guess with at least 1-3 Friends it makes maaaaaaybe a bit more fun, sadly its ONLY LOCEL MULTIPLAYER, which means a Online-Multiplayer would be more fun at all (or at least handy~) but thinking about that we just ""dig and grind"" around...i guess after some minutes me and my friends would stop playing it...AND if i see it really GIVES a achievment that you CAN finish it in less than a Hour it makes it even more worse looking that Super Motherload has such a high price from 15€.So if i come to the factsIts just...digging and grinding.....and that for 15€? I mean even Terraria has not that high price and i can BUILD something there and digging....and...grinding...you know  (i DONT compair the games just in case someone would think so)? So i would coment to lower the price (like 8€ maybe) to get a fair deal out of it, you should really think twice about to buy it full price, really coz i guess you may play it ones and if youre done, you ARE done with it..."

Super Motherload is the sequel to Motherload, a flash browser game made in the early 2000's. Though there has been minor refinement to some of the original title's systems, the gameplay at the core of Super Motherload is largely the same. You're the pilot of an underground/aireal digging machine and you've been tasked to aid the Solaris Corporation in excavating the planet Mars for precious metals, gemstones, and other rarities.The sequel has allowed for up to 4 players on screen simultaneously, and the result is a much more chaotic session of play. The soundtrack is lovely, having an industrial techno feel to it. The story is interesting as it deals with something many people today deal with themselves; corporate greed, and how it leads to ruin. There are multiple characters, even some hidden unlockable characters to discover. There are two modes in Super Motherload as well: Normal and Hardcore mode. Fans of the original flash game will find all the challenge they've become accustomed to in Hardcore mode, where your ship will immediately explode in a firey deathstorm, should your fuel ever reach 0.My girlfriend and I love to kick back after an exciting day and chill out underground with Super Motherload.8/10 would dig again."

Like many people, I highly anticipated this game, hoping it was better in every way. Unfortunately I feel this was not the case. They've missed alot of key points that made the original motherload so fun, process of upgrading your drill bot and buying consumables are very dull and automated. The mining itself has become more of a puzzle game, you use a variety of bombs to get to very awkwardly placed ores. The joy in finding rare ores in the original game is not present in the newer version, pretty much everything is abundant. Besides that, the game has a very intriguing atmosphere that is really fun, the artwork and music are really well done as well. One thing that Super Motherload also does really well is the storyline, it's interesting and ties the whole game together well.The game is still in Beta, and besides a few rough spots it is still a decent game worth the money."

Keep that in mind for this review.No, I don't think it was worth $15. I bought it when it was about $3.99, and I still feel like that was cheating the developers, but I wouldn't have paid $15 for this.I noticed a lot of people were not happy with this game, and for some reasons, I can see why: the minimap is really tiny, especially when playing on a big screen. Sometimes blocks just float a little strangely, don't break in the right way. The controls sometimes get a little soggy feeling on the keyboard (so it's worth shelling out for a controller!), which can lead to some enraging drops, and upgrades process doesn't really keep you updated on what you've actually bought, and what that does. Some of the explosives challenges are annoying, and can lead to some aggravating situations (That one unobtainium up on the top edge! Damn it!)But. For a game that brings back my memories of the original Motherload (which is included in buying this, by the way!), I couldn't think of anything better. A beautiful world, spectacular design, a great update to the filling/selling/upgrading process (just... driving over the buildings? Holy cow!), the checkpoints and bases system, the smelting/combining system, which totally revitalised my joy of mining... the list goes on. The music is amazing, though I wish I could have had that original jam updated... could have listened to that on repeat for days! The replay value is... okay. For some, getting to the end is all they wanted. Forme, the replay value was through the roof: I could drag a few friends over, throw the game up on the TV, and have a hysterical time. I could put it on my laptop and kill some time mining instead of writing press releases. I could put it on my screen in my room, and play it before going to bed. I enjoy mining way too much. I have issues.So it's a good purchase. Play it with your friends. Play it by yourself. Go mining."

You even get started with no introduction on the explosives you have on hand, nor instructions on how they work.The quest items that show up as locked boxes? Highly annoying and just get in the way.The loss of inventory to eject ores is devastating to me, while not being able to smelt ores already in your hold and having to pick up in a sequence is annoying, but bearable.On the other hand, it comes with the old version, and I suppose I could simply just play that instead."

For fans of the original Motherload, there's a Hardcore mode where the original death penalty for running out of fuel is still imposed. If you're expecting that, the game might seem easy to you; for example, in normal mode there's no need for teleportation to the surface beyond convienence rather than the thing that will save your life.The smelting feature adds a layer of complexity to my mining, as do the puzzles. Minding my order and making sure to leave space to pick up ore in the correct sequence to make new compounds does make the mining more interesting and less of a slog than it was in the flash game.My only real complaint thus far is the apparent lack of an inventory screen. I would like to see what ore I've collected, what upgrades I've outfitted my vessel with, and what quantifiable difference the upgrade made (I particularly miss the measurement of the cargo bay. I'd prefer the game tell me how big my new cargo bay is rather than me trying to count how many pieces of ore I've collected until I hit 'Cargo Bay Full'). I would especially like some sort of reminder of what was the last piece of ore I collected.  For example, say I'm trying to make White Gold. If I forget whether I've picked up the bronze or just the silver, then I won't know whether I should go grab that piece of gold or now. Or, suppose you have a diamond sitting in there that you've forgotten about, and you pick an emerald to collect before an amazonite.

You spend your funds on upgrades that allow you to go deeper and deeper, receiving cryptic transmissions along the way - eventually reaching the center of Mars.That might sound boring but this game does a pretty good job of keeping it fresh. Soon you will encounter rocks that block your way, find upgrades that reward you for picking up specific minerals in order, and lava that you can drill through at the cost of a good portion of your health. Soon, the game becomes a puzzle, trying to figure out the most efficient way to drill in order to reach the valuables.If you want a basic idea of how this game works, look up Motherload. It's an old (free) browser game this one was based on.PresentationThis game's presentation is fantastic, featuring a powerful and atmospheric soundtrack by Eric Cheng and beautiful art by Scott Carmichael. Despite being a simple digging game there is crazy amounts of atmosphere.The voice acting ranges from ""good but weird"" to ""unintentionally hilarious"". It can break immersion but usually it's not a problem.Hardcore modeRegular mode is fun for a while but it gets boring when there's no consequence of being stupid. Enter Hardcore mode. Hardcore mode is not for giggles with your buddies.If you die, that character is dead forever. You'll need to start a new save to use that particular character.If you run out of fuel, you die. Also, all players in the session share fuel so die, die, die, and die.I love it.The storyIt's pretty good. It's not absolutely captivating, but it's... reasonably compelling. You are an employee of Solarus corporation, mining into Mars. As you drill deeper and deeper you hear strange transmissions from the other miners and discover that something's gone wrong - and that's not Solarus talking to you.OverallIt's a good game. It isn't fun in the same sense that some games are, but it's absolutely worth playing. Again, if you're on the fence, look up the original Motherload."

That little experience has stuck with me all this time.I got excited when I learned that SUPER Motherload was in development, and placed it in my Wish List.Maybe my expectations were that of my pre-teen years but this game IS lacking SOMETHING from the original. Granted it is fun to play and relatively short to beat compared to some the length of some games. But possibly, there's too much focus on path finding and challenge beating. It was a fun game to begin with, but I feel maybe too much was put into the game about trying to face challenges and having to GRIND for everything that you need. The game is too repetitive to pay for something as much as 5 mil. They certainly did a good job, works awesomely with a controller, maybe I'm just being too nostalgic, but it doesn't hit home for me."

It is not very complicated, deep or nuanced, but it's a good time waster for a while, and an inexpensive one. If you need something not too complicated to waste some time with, you could do far worse, but my recommendation is dependent upon knowing what it is and what it is not."

Using other names like Fantastic Motherload or Marvelous Motherload would also be good sequel names.Spoilers:We tried to do everything in one world cause we didn't know characters were the same between worlds. Once we made new worlds everything became easier.I read a tip about buying magma money upgrades and we cheesed so hard. Mine magma and die over and over for infinite money. We didn't really need to though. We realized after we overprepared that we just needed a ton of repairs to win against the final boss. We had a ton of fun through all this process and grinding.Nuke bombs are hilarious."

They added a bunch of new mechanics that saddly fall short and fail to add much to the game, as the lack of reward makes it feel like a grind. Voice acting is sub-par and the story is mediocre at best.Despite all this, it's still a fun game, and a nice way to waste the day away."
