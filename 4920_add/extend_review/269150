The ""stimulate it -- but not too much at once"" mechanic is a lot more fun than you'd think from just reading about it; you want to keep the flowers at a good level of happy and blushing, but not just steamroller ahead for the goal......or it gets sort of dissatisfied, shuts you out and tells you ""that's OK; these things happen.""Frankly, I feel like the better I get at this game, the more likely I am to be spared when Skynet becomes self-aware.  Or SHODAN: call me!edit: Oh, I didn't realize you couldn't say that on Steam.  I assisted the computer in climaxing as I would a very special ladyfriend.   ""La petite mort;"" that's what I meant to say."

Never thought I would get so much enjoyment and pleasure out of ""pleasing flowers."" ... *ahem* Yeah.This game is very sexual, very erotic, and yet, doesn't strike me as lustful or dirty. The controls (Oscillating both analogs on xbox controllers) feels just as provocative as you could expect, and everything just works together. The gameplay is very simple, but again, it all matches the theme and the feel. It all stays fantastically consistent.Now, I'm off to take a cold shower."

Why?It is colorful, highly sexual without having any actualy pornographic images (though the text leaves little to the imagination), has an unusual, electronic and reactive soundtrack, and is less a game than an experience.  I happened to think it was a somewhat snide concept, innovative for it's genre, and immersive in an artistic way, and I took it on that level.  I like it.On the other hand, it is not a game built for the PC, but a touch screen, and as I understand it, it hasn't been altered in any way to improve gameplay for a PC.  It has no plots, no really deep puzzles, isn't really a simulation (unless you count stimulation), and is graphically on par with a nicely done flash game.  It also has little replay value (unless it happens to fulfill some other needs in your life), and can be played through in under an hour.  In other words, it was built for casual gamers, and it is casual gamers who shall play it.  Because of this, while I like it, I can't in good conscience recommend it to the Steam community, which prides itself on technologically and graphically superior games and/or immersive, story-driven games.Great for:  people who really like experimental games, colorful and design-heavy images, and simple gameplay (and innuendo).Not great for:  Most computer gamers (I.E., if you want at least an hour of gameplay, to make use of your graphics card, and/or some kind of plot to your diversions)."

,Recommended,269150,32838055,Posted: 26 June,all,Euronymouse,"What is it?Well, as acomputer game: it's a bit more than an hour's worth of gameplay, if you take it relatively slowly, although you could stretch it out more if you wanted.  And there are technically 12 levels, but they differ from each other in ways that are mostly cosmetic.  In all of them, gameplay isn't skill-based but patience-based: you do best if you go very very slowly, although as long as you don't gotoofast, the game will allow you to finish the level.  It's hard to justify the game's price on account of its gameplay, though.As aninteractive art exhibit, it's a neat conceptualization of either the female orgasm or the psychedelic experience, and it's totally worth a few moments of your time.  There's some psychedelic music and cute little animations that wouldn't have been out of place in the BeatlesYellow Submarinemovie.  You probably haven't played anything quite like this before.  I could imagine some people finding the experience very relaxing— I didn't, but that was just because neither the keyboard + mouse nor the controller interface felt quite right to me.  It would probably be enjoyable to experience in VR or on some kind of really heavy drugs.What it would be really great at would be anAudiosurf-style procedural-level game.  Because playing a Shpongle track that sync'd to one of these these flower tunnels would bedeeeecent.  Sadly, the developers did not see fit to code in this functionality.It's a really cool idea, executed with some finesse.  It's probably good for an hour's entertainment, once.  If you can justify throwing down the necessary ducats for that much playtime, you could do worse.EDIT:it is obscene that Steam's language filter flags ""orgasm.""  That is some serious grade-A Puritanical nonsense, GabeN."

I watched the trailer and thought the game looked like a fun, relaxing color + music game, similar to audiosurf or something. What I did NOT understand from the trailer video is that this is an erotic edging game. You travel down a tunnel (it's a vag, lets face it), as strange music plays, while being given commands to go slowly and make ""it"" last as long as possible. The game gives you commands, like ""buzz in me"", ""you on top"" and ""kiss me"", among many other awkward things. Had I known this game was going to make me feel uncomfortable, like I was being coerced into leading a digital vag into a thinly veiled ecstasy, I NEVER EVER would've bought it. I bet some crusty nerds will think this game is super sexy, but as a woman I just feel used and confused by it. If you want to make a porn game, just make one. Don't mis-advertise it as some cutesy indie game and then cause your players to feel violated."

As it's quite a personal experience, many of you wouldn't like it, because at first glance it can be seen as ""dirty"" or even ""sick"" to make a game about that.

It's very colorful and pretty, but the whole time you're navigating the pretty pulsating corridor you're pushing onward into, you're getting phrases tossed at you in white lettering. ""Desire me"", ""Please me"", ""Take what you want from me"", and ""Oops"" (when you rush navigating the... corridor).It is very much like The Graveyard, in this respect: will you read and act on your partner's cues, or will you rush blindly forward, uncaring of how your partner responds? It disguises the deeper meaning in almost shooter gameplay, hallucinatory and vivid visuals, and titillation."

(I suppose it depends on your available leisure money.)That said, the game is fun for people like me who like games with low-pressure win conditions; it's not at all clear when you start playing what you're supposed to do--but it doesn't matter; you click the pretty flower and it explodes into color and moans at you.Flower. Moaning. And saying ""yes"" and ""more, faster, please,"" and similar comments. The only thing subtle about the eroticism in this game is the lack of human-shaped genitalia. The actual game mechanics are subtle: after the first flower event (not sure what else to call it), you get progress bars, and more flowers open up; you can replay each of them, trying to maximize, erm, ""color,"" which is not the same as speed--go too fast, and you'll be told to slow down.... Maybe it is worth full price."

Basically, you have to go through a tunnel and make it change colors. Go too fast and the entity isnt happy with you. Go nice and slow, try to max out the score (shown in top left corner of screen during game play) and get gold, then all is well. The higher your score, the more color that will be applied to the pillars of the gazebo you see upon loading in. Eventually, you get the color all the way to the top of the gazebo.Disclaimer: I haven't beaten the game yet so I don't know what happens once all the pillars are colored.You can turn off the voices and text that appear during your travel if those prove to be a slight distraction.Overall, it is not bad but I wouldn't call it outstanding.

What I didn't like was the actual experience of playing it. I don't have a gamepad, it doesn't work well with the mouse, and I don't like touching my laptop screen. So I bought it on Android - I really love the feeling of my phone's screen - and got on with it much better. It's one of those games that's all about the ~experience~ rather than the score. You need to enjoy the interaction with this psychedelic, surreal environment for its own sake. It's made up of touch music and colours; if you like those things in combination, unembellished by storyline or high scores,  then you will like this game.You really do need to make sure that you enjoy touching your screen if you want to play it with a touchscreen, though. Rub your screen in circles for a full minute. If that feels weird to you don't get this game.Also, it's about sex. Quite explicitly, in a not particularly explicit way (...that makes sense if you play the game). I find it very similar to getting a woman off, in a strange abstract/metaphorical way. Each flower wants something different, you need to find the right rhythm and pattern for that flower, you need to have some patience for it all to all work out right, if you touch the wrong thing at the wrong time you need to start again...and sometimes you try to extend it out but get too excited and finish right then. It kind of makes me want to call my girlfriend or boot up some queer porn for alone time."
