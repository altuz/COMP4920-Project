This could very well be the Vive's main attraction! I could see myself playing this for hours, and hours on end. The social interaction is just so wonderful! The ability to actually see the other players hands and head really adds a new level of immersion to this game!I have already made two friends by just joining a random session, talking with them, and shooting some pool! The details in this game (or should I say ""accurate simulation""), are so polished and beautifully created, you easily get immersed in a whole new world...or bar I should say. The physics are 100% accurate, and it is not noticably different from real life. This is greater then real life pool, this is...Pool Nation VR!

You\'re in a bar, you can manipulate most things, the atmosphere is great, and the game itself actually has a game IN it :O what a concept!- There are a number of AI opponents that range in difficulty- Winning spawns presents that give you unlockables... it is the MOST satisfying thing- The controls, to me, are some of the best implemented in a game for world manipulation, the grip controls are the greatest thing in this game!- Using the cue and the aiming system is great, however I wish there was a height adjustment. Being a little taller(6\'1) I find I have to almost squat to line a shot up. Butman...it/'stoo cool when you sink something you meant to- I have yet to try multiplayer, but I\'d rather play AI. But playing with a friend would be awesome.- There\'s darts in the game. Not the easiest to play but still very satisfying when you hit the board hahaI hope they continue to update this game with some features that would make it pretty damn awesome:- Control the music with your own music library, including shared tunes across streams- Varied environments and perhaps even a few story modes where you play in front of crowds and have rival VR bots- Branch out to Snooker and trick shotsEither way, you like pool?

Physics as well as hit detection is just perfect.I only have about 40 mins to 1 hour invested so far but that time passed by in what felt like a split second.So far I've only fooled around a bit in the environment and played the AI a couple of times.It's probably just me (sucks at pool) but the AI has bested me every time, and since it's the easiest difficulty it should be a little easier.Don't get me wrong, I like a challenge, but since there's about 10-15 difficulty settings the easiest one should be a cakewalk. That way it would be both a casual game that caters everyone, but they seem to be aiming for the hardcore pool enthusiasts.Pros:Great physicsAwesome graphicsTruly immersivePriceworthyCons:AI a little too good (like I mentioned, probably just me)Dart physics are a bit off at the momentFor some objects the SFX sometimes doesn't playConclusionA hell of a game that's more or less free.There are some minor caveats, but they're all patchable.ImprovementsPlease oh please add multiplayer hubs for about 15-20 players so you can just hang out by the sofas and chat, walk around and spectate tables etc. That would be EPIC!"

,Recommended,269170,23332914,"Posted: 1 June, 2016",all,Luuuuuuke,"Awesome. Awesome.Firstly, the pool game itself is very good. It’s intuitive and slick, and the whole environment looks great. You can also play darts, but I found this to be fairly tricky. I’m sure it could be mastered with a bit of practice though.But that’s not where the appeal of this game really lies. It’s an insight into just how social strapping a brick to your head, in a dark room, on your own can actually be. Until now, fun as it may be, VR has been a pretty lonely experience in most games, but Pool Nation VR changes that.The multiplayer mode is hilarious. Even though your opponent only appears as goggles and controllers-for-hands, their realistic movements really do give you the sense that you’re actually in the room with someone. Once you have a buddy to share the space with, the pool almost becomes secondary because there are so many other amusing ways to entertain yourselves. Virtually everything in the room can be interacted with, and the physics are pretty spot on.Bearing in mind that it’s this much fun with total strangers, I can’t wait until VR is more commonplace and my mates and I can have virtual get-togethers, presumably on a more regular basis than is feasible to arrange in real life. I’m thinking poker games etc.In the games I played against numerous opponents, neither of us spoke much. I put this down to the poor quality of the microphone in the Vive, and the fact that it was late at night and the rest of my family were fast asleep. Instead, all you can hear (aside from the background pub noise and the music) is the pair of you rapidly descending into uncontrollable fits of childish giggles. I could actually see them physically bent over double, as was I! Almost every time I played a shot, I’d look up and see the other guy doing something comical, and vice-versa. I was crying with laughter for most of the time, more so than I’ve done in ages. We tended to use gestures to show, for example, frustration at missing a shot or an outrageous fluke, rather than saying things out loud.It was all the more entertaining because this was on the day of release, so you could see that everyone was still figuring it out and were awestruck by the novelty of it all.Technically this game excels too. The textures look great, and it’s the only game I’ve seen that manages to make the resolution of the screens look several times greater than they actually are and as they appears in other titles.My only complaints thus far are:•	I’d like to be able to adjust the position of my grip hand on the butt of the cue. The reason being is because, by default, it’s quite far forwards and I can see no way of changing it. This means you’re hitting your body with the controller as you stroke the cue back and forth. In real life my hand would be further behind me.•	Sidespin doesn’t seem to take any affect when the ball bounces off a cushion, and I can’t appear to get the ball to swerve. Maybe I just need more practice.-       The background sounds are on a loop of a few minutes, and every so often you hear some bloke banging on about 'Tuesday night, Tuesday night'. If it weren't for him you probably wouldn't notice it looping. It just breaks the immersion slightly.Some suggestions and wishes:•	Multiple players (as in more than two), and/or spectators. It would just add to the atmosphere and hilarity. You’d probably need to be able to set up an exclusion zone around your table though to stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to ruin your games. Either that or a vote-to-kick or some sort of block system.•	Access to your own music library. It would be cool if it could be displayed and selected using the jukebox in the room. I could create a playlist and then anyone could choose songs from it to queue up.•	I’m sure there’s a technical term for this, but it makes things so much more realistic when objects resist each other. E.g. at Present, I can grab a bottle and wave it through other objects. In Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades, for example, the physics are just a little better in this way.•	Following on from the point above, I shouldn’t be able to play a shot where my cue is intersecting another object – a ball in front or the cushion of the table etc.•	When positioning your head within a solid object, such as a wall or the pool table, the sound and vision should go blurry, like in Call of the Starseed.•	Be able to write messages – maybe on a board so you can hold it up to the intended recipient (assuming more participants are allowed in later releases). Could either type text or scrawl it with chalk or the like. Maybe have a set of predefined sentences and/or be able to define your own (‘good shot’, ‘you fluky♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc.). This goes back to what I was saying earlier about not being able to talk if the rest of your household are asleep or whatever.•	Beer to flow from the bottles and bar taps.-       Mirrors on the wall so you can see yourself also.•	Change the TV channels, or even play music videos from your library.•	More environments.•	Be able to create and share new environments, tables, people, cues etc.•	Be able to create, style and position bystander avatars.•	Be able to control lighting levels etc.•	Be able to control ambient noise and music levels.•	Have a full head visible instead of just the VR goggles and hats. Could even have facial expressions to select from. Could be amusing.•	Hands visible in the game instead of controllers? You could then have hand gestures like in Hover Junkers.•	Miscues if you hit the ball at an acute angle and/or haven’t chalked your cue (need to be able to chalk the cue!).•	More game types/rules. English pub rules. Red and yellow. Two shots upon fouling etc. Display the rules somewhere.•	Snooker option.•	Replays. Slow-motion etc.•	Pocket tightness adjustment.•	Table speed adjustment.•	The potted balls to show up in the clear slot on the side of the table like in real life.•	Room scale and height adjuster.•	Adjust the scale of the people in the room. Everyone seems a bit small, which is fine for the girls, but the guys look a tad out of proportion.•	The bystanders to walk around instead of just dancing and chatting on the spot.•	Be able to punch the guys and undress the girls. There, I said it. Everyone was thinking it!Tip: You can actually grab the three big lights above the pool table and take it with you to illuminate the sweet, peachy asses of the chicks around the room. You’re welcome. Update: They just fixed that bug. It was fun while it lasted. Maybe they could put a torch in the room instead??Until now, Audioshield was my favourite (followed by Project Cars), but Pool Nation VR now easily takes that crown by a loooong way.I already had high hopes/expectations for the future potential of VR hardware and apps, but this definitely raises the bar and whets the appetite further. Lest we forget we’re only a few months into this whole VR adventure (proper), and if we’re already achieving this then it bodes extremely well.Props to the devs.This is the future!Awesome."

OMG the realism in playing pool alone is worth it. The physics are as real as the get minus having a table to lean on. Air hockey is geat as well. What would make this game more real is to have 2 modes. One is ""Freeplay"" and the other is ""Money"" mode. You come in with $50 VR dollars and play games to win more or lose it all. Use the money at the bar or bet on games you play for more. Even have a fake ATM inside to deposit your winnings and use later. Also, please add a ""Claw Machine"" for fun prizes. Overall one of the most useful fun VR games that VR was meant for and worth it. A door to the bowling alley is a must for a future feature."

It's exactly what VR pool ought to be.Things I like:- Arcade-like assists like ghost ball that are completely optional.- Multiple game modes- Locking the cue in place mechanics- Teleport, snap-to-table-edge teleport, AND wand-based positioning- Efforts to support a physical table in the play area (though completely optional)Things I'd like to see changed or improved:- Scale feels a little bit small to me.  NPCs are all about 5'2"".- Ability to turn off NPCs and misc. throwable objects to save performance.- More environment choices (with less ray-inducing neon), including a VERY basic environment for performance.Others may disagree, but while the environment looks very nice and is lively (nice job!), my personal preference is the quality and performance of the table and game of pool.  I can run medium settings on my GTX 780 with reprojection, but I'd gladly turn everything else off if I could run high settings on the table itself."
,Recommended,269170,23362123,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,ItsCrisp,"This is easily one of the most immersive and 'full' feeling VR games out there right now. The bar is gorgous and has a great atmosphere and the devs took full advantage of UE4's powerful lighting tools.Interaction with the game is simple, fun, and predictable. The physics of the pool balls and how they move around the table/react to the cue are spot on. It's almost frightening. There's a ton of other stuff in the bar to grab and toss and interact with. You can even play darts and it'll track your score for you, which is pretty cool.This is my first VR title with mutliplayer and the feeling of being next to another human (who may be on the other side of the world for all you know) and being able to hear their voice come out of their 'face' and see their gestures and mannerisms, and understand when they're shrugging or leaning on something or holding their hands on their hips when it's just represented by a set of floating goggles and controllers is an unreal feeling. My first multiplayer match was with someone I didn't share a language with, and we just spent 20 minutes throwing bottles and chairs at each other and fooling around and giggling like children.That alone was worth the cost of admission.Plus, the devs are active in the community, seem like good guys (or gals) and are working towards improving performance and adding content.You can't lose with this purchase."

I was totally immersed.The physics are great, the graphics are amazing, there's plenty to see and do and the social interactions are the icing on the cake.This feels like a lot of time and care has gone into making it and it feels like one of the first fully polished experiences for this gen of VR.

Pool Nation VR is truly a great VR experience and perhaps a showcase for what is possible moving forward. It looks terrific and the pool playing feels very realistic, enough that I keep trying to lean on the damn table that doesn't exist! I only have about an hour of playtime, but only because I haven't had much time lately. Stupid real life always getting in the way! ;) I really want to sink more time in this and can easily see my self spending hours in this bar playing pool with buddies. Great job on this one!! Totally worth the 17 bucks.Minor critiquesI wish you could play an actual game of darts, from my quick experience it seems the score resets after every three darts.I can't seem to figure out how to put a player name in the box. I don't wanna be ""player""!!Optimization. On medium settings I run 90fps, high 45ish fps, and ultra 30ish fps. I'm running an I7, 32g ram and 980ti SLI on an Asus Rock MB. Now I realize that VR doesn't utilize SLI, but I still feel like I should get higher than  30 fps on the ultra settings. Maybe I'm wrong here. At any rate, I list this as a critique and not a complaint because it looks fine and runs superbly awesome on the medium settings.9/10 - Will keep leaning on invisible table."

I got so immersed in my game that I find myself leaning over the table, barely able to reach the cue ball, just to get a shot in. The table isn't there, of course, and I could just walk through the table to easily shoot. But because I felt like I was in a bar, and I felt like I was playing pool in real life, I found myself leaning. It's great.The game is very nice, graphically. The sound is good, with the thuds and scratches of the pool balls sounding realistic. There are jukeboxes in the bar, but there isn't a whole lot of song selections. I didn't mess with it myself, so there may be more options available than I'm not aware of.As far as the gameplay is concerned, it feels very fluid, and the controls are fairly simple to learn. Having to aim both the cue ball and where you're going to strike the cue ball itself is a little tricky, I've found, but that's more of a player being bad kind of thing and not the games fault. There's single player, with multiple levels of difficulty to choose from, and multiplayer. I've played a few games of multiplayer, and it was a great experience. There were no hitches, both of us moved fluidly, and the voice chat worked flawlessly.I did experience a few bugs, though, such as the game telling me I was supposed to hit the solid balls, but then calling a foul on me for hitting the wrong balls (I was actually stripes). A few times the game called a foul on me for scratching the cue ball (hitting it into the pocket) when I didn't. But these experiences only happened one time each, and I feel that they'll be fixed soon.I cannot recommend this game enough. If you're not a fan of pool, then the novelty of being in a bar, throwing objects around and playing darts isn't going to last you long enough to justify buying the product. But if you are a fan, or even if you don't really like or dislike pool, you should get this. It's just an amazing, immersive experience."

Its polished, fun, and has working multiplayer - something rare in VR right now.  The physics feels impressive and it really does feel like you're playing pool.  The polish level is also very high, especially for VR which unfortunately attracts shovelware developers.  If you have a small-ish VR space like I do, this game will definitely make you wish for larger space so you don't have to teleport for every shot.But, its just pool. There's no crazy game modes or anything.  This isn't a complaint, but its important to know this game is faithful to real pool rules and  a high level of pool simulation.  Personally, I find it very relaxing, but I can see how others might find it boring after a while.  I have read the devs want to add more mini games. Currently you can play darts in the virtual pool hall. I guess we'll see when that stuff comes out and how it affects the game.  I would love a real human avatar, but asking for that kind of thing this early in VR might be too much.Still, highly recommended.One caveat: Your mic is on by default in this game and it is not push to talk. The other player can hear everything you say, and often your breathing. I would have greatly prefered push to talk or muted by default."

No motion sickness for me.- I couldn't figure out matchmaking options, but I can probably do it with more tinkering.- The bar environs will likely get old, as well as the soundtrack.

,Recommended,269170,23346381,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Skunkhauser,"Initial thoughts from Vive owner, and old-school 9-ball tourney player.Environment: Very immersive environment, I initially forgot about Chapperone and tried walking around the table as though it were real. It was nice to sidle up to the bar and pretend to order a drink, and throw bottles around. The sound effects from the bar get repeitive, and the AI ""extras"" just repeat the same motions, but they're not meant to be the focus of the game.  I do like that you can wander around the bar and find a few quiet spots, but there's little else to explore.I'm 6'1"" tall, and all the AI extras seemed like they were 5'0"".  This, combined with how ""low"" the tables feel, it seems there may be a slight scaling issue.  It would be nice to adjust player height, or be able to adjust vertically with the grip movement.Interface: The controls were very good and responsive, and once you understand them they feel natural and intuitive.  I am especially a fan of using the grips to move the table around the user - this let me line up shots naturally as I normally would, as well as let me stand in the middle of the table so I didn't have to reach too far into cyberspace that I'd fall over IRL.  The grips felt like using ""wheelchair"" mode, and was by far the best-designed part of the game.I was a little disappointed with the ""fine tuning"" aiming helper - it definitely helps line up shots, but seems to have the same sensitivity as normal shots (only it locks one hand).  But this is a minor issue.Game/Physics:  This is the #1 most important issue for hardcore pool players when evaluating a pool game.  The physics are ""okay"" - it's no Virtual Pool 4.  Cue-english seems to work somewhat, though the table feels slippery, so english doesn't affect it as much as expected.  The pockets on the tables feel very sloppy, at times too tight, at times too wide.  Ball contact angles are pretty solid, so after some mental adjustment you get the feel of how the game wants to be played.For other objects, physics seems janky - beer caps and dice barely bounce at all, while bar chairs will bounce all over the place.  I'm not a dart player, but I felt like I could get to learn the proper throws for darts.Overall:  If you're into billiards/pool, you'll have a good time.  There are only a few game modes, doesn't seem like you can choose different tables or environments, so it's a pretty limited experience yet.  I haven't had a chance to try MP, but unless networking code is wacked out it should feel similar to playing the AI.  If you're looking for deep career-mode style pool with ladders and locales, it's not here.  If you're not into pool much you may need to pass, because throwing things around a bar at short people who don't respond to you gets old pretty quick.7/10 - recommended for pool fans"
,Recommended,269170,23354762,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,DweezilX,"TLDR: If you enjoy pool and own a vive buy this.What an incredible experience Pool Nation VR is.I am running an old i5-2500k and a nvidia 970 for reference.The graphics in this game are top notch. You spawn into a bar with weird npcs silently dancing/shuffling in the corner, TVs showing ads for a pool game, a jukebox, dartboard, and of course the pool table.The default quality setting of medium did not allow me to hit 90 fps so the reprojection was kicking in and fps was 45. Turning the quality to low, while sacrificing some visual fidelity, allowed my system to consistently hit 90 fps with a minor hit to graphics.The main attraction for this game is the multiplayer.After starting a game and getting someone to join it becomes a very interesting social experiment. I have played with many people, the vast majority either have their mic muted or have not figured out how to setup the vive mic. Others speak languages that I have no clue what they are saying. A handful have actually spoken Enligsh (I am a stupid American and don't know many languages) and that is where the majority of the enjoyment from this title has come from for me. Playing with a random person, talking as if we were in the same room and playing pool. It is an incredible sense of presence for me and really makes me feel like this random person is in my room.This is where some caveats come: this is the internet and people are not generally known for demonstrating common sense or respect for anonymous people who they will never see in real life. This can lead to people messing with you, some do it aggressively with spamming beer bottles, smashing lights, or the destruction that is the jukebox.The majority of the people I have met have been cool dudes that are as impressed with the game as I am and just want to play a game of pool.I strongly encourage players of this game setting up a real life table to lean against and steady shots on. This helps IMMENSELY (use the arrow keys on the keyboard when you are in game to change the height of the table to match yours).If you have a vive I recommend you give Pool Nation VR a shot. I am terrible at pool in real life (sort of) but with ghost balls (cheating, sue me) it makes the game a lot easier and it allows you to have fun with people a world away.Last note: The 'hulk mode' reorientation/locomotion was extremely disorienting and disconcerting for me when I began to play it, this has largely gone away and I have acquired stronger VR legs throughout the games.Oh ya and HATS. I got a pirate one (arrrr) and a cowboy one (yeeeehawww). See you in game!"

So realistic even, you'll want to lean on the table as you play only to discover your floor instead.I love how you can play other mini games like air hockey, chess, darts and more...The controls are very intuitive and easy.  The ""hulk"" movement system is very smooth and should be implemented in other games as well.I would like to see a game of table tennis being added in the future.There are a few minor points I would like to see improved though.There don't seem to be many online players.  It can take while before you find people to play with.  This game should be cross platform with Playstation to increase the general player-pool.Also, the speech audio could be slightly improved.  Such as when a player speaks further away it is more silent.  Because when 6 players are in the room speaking with each other, the dialogue can get very chaotic and it can be hard to know who's talking to who.And I would love the ability to listen to my own music on the jukebox.But apart from that, this is a must buy!

When I saw that you could pair up with others online and play I thought it would be fun, I wasn't dissapointed!The graphics are really really good, it's not too blurry as a lot of VR games can be with the current generation of hardware. At times it can be difficult to tell if a ball is stripe or solid when it's far away, it's not a big deal to just move your head in a bit closer and have a look. The physics of the pool table are about as good as they can be!I usually complain about everything but I don't really have much to say here. All I can think of would be a couple of feature additions such as the ability to change the way you look in game, maybe the option to use your own music on the juke box, and maybe to join games as a spectator (just hang out off to the side of a game). It would also be nice if they made it so you couldn't actually move yoruself over the top of the pool table. I don't really see how they could do that so I guess that's why they didn't do it lol.The only issue I seem to have found with this game is that the button to put the pool stick away doesn't always seem to work when I tap the button, it's not really a problem but it's something I noticed.

I immediately rushed to grab it and stop it from spilling except there were two problems:The can wasn't openThe can was in VRI really surprised myself with my default reflexes of ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥I better catch that!""So basically this is Pool in VR.  More ""Virtual Pool"" than  ""Virtual Pool"" is... (though I would have argued Virtual Pool was pretty realistic back in the late 90's).  You have a few tables, a jukebox, a couple of dart boards, a bar with a bunch of bartenders doing the ""I gotta pee"" dance. A few bar patrons also doing the same ""I gotta pee"" dance.  And that's enough to remind me of weekends hanging out at Rusty's Billiards.The coolest thing is, you could play darts if you wanted to, you can change the music on the jukebox (though it seems like they only have a handful of songs), you can conjure yourself up a beer... bottle.  It's empty though, so no getting virtually drunk and starting a virtual bar fight.There's also a multiplayer mode which I have yet to try but it looks great.  There's only one thing missing:  Something to lean on as you make your shots.  If I had a real world ""surrogate table"" to play against, this game would be so very awesome.   It's still great though, don't get me wrong.  It just kinda ruins the immersion when you have to hover your arms in the air while taking a shot.Things I liked about this game:They really nailed the bar atmosphere.  The only thing that would make it more authentic would be to have it filled with smoke and have some arcade games off in the corner... Oh and maybe a selection of cue sticks to choose from and some chalk for the tip of your cue.The tables are my favorite color for pool tables (though I could see some people wanting the traditional green felt)Darts!They give you 8 ball and 9 ball at least. I would like more game options (rotation? Straight pool?) but 8 and 9 ball are a good start.Makes good use of all the available room scale game spaceThings I didn't like:Aiming without something to lean on is really awkward and ruins the immersion (This is not really the game's fault though)The people seem to be a BIT on the small side.  Like the height is ok, but their body size is super skinny...  it's a small complaint really because the main focus is the game, not the people standing around, but I feel like they could make the people a bit wider.  Imagine a 5'2"" girl stretched out to 5'6"" and that's how it seems  Squish her height back down to 5'2"" and she looks fine, but stretched out she seems unnaturally skinny...uncanny valley style.Only two pool games (8 and 9 ball) and the dart game seems like there's not much to it yet other than throw the darts and look at the score on the wall.I really didn't have that many complaints with this game, except for the AI really is kinda lame at the easiest level, but it always is... I feel like the AI lets me win on the easiest level, and the level 3 AI is the closest to the real ""novice"" player.So anyway, my recommendation is: find something like a barstool to lean on so you can take your shots more realistically.  Don't forget to pick it up and carry it with you (or else teleport everywhere) or you might be tempted to put your hand down on thin air and fall to the floor.This game is definitely worth buying."

Presence is great. There's a good teleportation system--I was able to play just fine with about 4 square meters of space.You can move the whole room around to get a good angle, and it's not very nausea-inducing if you look at the table while doing it. There's a grid that appears around you while moving the room, which stays stationary and keeps you feeling anchored in space.It's a bit weird to line up your shot when you can't rest your hand on the table, but you can lock it in place so you don\'t have to worry about holding it still while you follow through.It felt more natural than any computer pool game I've ever played. I even found it easier to line up my shots when the ""ghost ball"" aiming aid was turned off.[after 90 minutes]Still really impressed. The resolution of the Vive is a noticeable limitation on long shots. I ended up using the back of a recliner as stand-in for the table itself. With a steady bridge hand I started making shots much more often.The atmosphere is tuned really well. There's movement and noise around you enough to make you feel like you're in a bar. I would say it's like a pool hall, but the only pool noises are the ones at your table. But the atmosphere is never so loud or animated that it distracts you. They clearly put a lot of work into the setting and it paid off.I have not had jutter playing on medium quality.

Well, throwing them is easy, throwing them accurately...not so much).The physics on the ball are good, and supposedly if you turn off ghost ball and some other feature you unlock 'pro mode' where the ball physics are more or less perfect to real life (the only issues you'll have with ghost ball on will be trying to do backspin across half a table length or more; it won't curve durng the shot as it would IRL).English (the ball physics property, not the language) is supported, so you can safely backspin a pocket shot to recall a ball across the table or avoid pocketing the cue ball. Jump shots also exist. Oh, and the AI has many small increments. You'll find an AI opponent that fits your skill level, I promise. Seriously, out of all the paid-for games on Vive right now, the ratio of cost:fun for this game is easily #1. You will not regret this purchase."
,Recommended,269170,23469317,"Posted: 9 June, 2016",all,Solar,This is one of the most immersive games I have experienced in VR so far. I actually felt like I was in a bar playing pool and chatting with a real person. All of the people I played with so far were really friendly. The physics is perfect and with the haptic feedback it actually feels real when I hit the ball. You can also play darts and break bottles or chairs while waiting for your opponent to finish their shot. The AI is good and the harder difficulties provide a nice challenge. The game looks good on medium and I get a stable 90fps with my 390x. In my opinion this is one of the best VR games out right now and I highly recommend getting it if you enjoy pool.

Particularly handy is the teleport function which can snap you to the edge of the table in one location, facing the table, very handy! The cue is also very well designed, there's a grip function which feels very natural for holding the cue straight as you try to hit your shot, which would be otherwise impossible without a table to lean on.

The amount of polish put into the game is evident. For example, if you're using the pool table, the now-common teleport mechanic can snap to the edge of the pool table and automatically face you inwards, making follow up shots quick without tangling the cables. You can also make fine adjustments by moving the world around you with the grips. The AIs are pretty good (though it would be nice if they would try to sink the 9-ball early in the 9-ball game, which even the hard ones don't currently appear to do), the multiplayer works well, it's great all around.But it doesn't end with pool! There's darts, and now air hockey. I have to say, the darts feel like the gravity's been turned up, but they still seem to work well with precise automatic scoring.

That decision cost me $20 because now that I've played it (and spent an hour trying), I wish like hell I could return it. I'm more than decent at billiards; bar table or 9ft, 8-ball or 9-ball, house cue or my own; I can run a table well enough and in this ""game"", I was lucky to sink a single shot. A large part of that is the fact that I'm hovering in space, not setting up a bridge on a real table so it's inherently unstable. The ""lock"" system would take care of that, except that there's not a stable way to get a shot setup and nothing to even assist in that such as a dampened movement system (something between the free and locked modes perhaps?). While walking around, the graphics are pretty, but that's about the only good thing I can say about this and I SO wanted to love it.Multi-player seems to be a bust too. I waited at least 30 minutes for a 9-ball game and never got an opponent.All that might have even been tollerable if I didn't have those damn ""lock"" dialogs in my face the whole time. There was a settings option to turn off hints, but that didn't remove them and there wasn't much else to tweak. The same issue made darts impossible because the dialog was between my face and the dart board.Don't waste your money. RecRoom is free and though it doesn't have billiards, it's infinitely more entertaining and has a lively crowd (sometimes too lively). Though it's graphics aren't so pretty as with Pool Nation (why the hell would you rename the game to ""SportsBar VR"" when there's no games playing on the TVs?! You guys DO realize that a sportsbar isn't where you play sports, but a bar where you watch sports right? Without alchohol and a game to watch, it's not a sportsbar and it makes finding the game impossible when looking for ""Pool Nation VR"", which is the obvious name given the ""Pool Nation"" line of games."

Performance optimization could maybe use some work, I've been playing on low with a gtx 970 to maintain a solid 90hz and even that drops frames now and then. It looks good even on low and on ultra its seriously great (just can't keep up with the frames).If you enjoy paying pool this is a no brainer, not only is it a must buy, it's a must buy whether or not it's on sale. Just buy the game, you'll sink at least an hour in the first time you step in."

Just add them yourself wherever you feel appropriate because I would sure use them if this wasn't a public forum!I love this! I never would have thought I'd like a pool game in VR, but this is just done so well! The only thing that got to me was ""reposition"" and that was just mild since I wasn't expecting it. Don't be moving your controllers when you press those buttons until you have tried it and know what you are about to do. But other than that, it's like having your own pool hall!Other than that, it's just so amazing how it all works. With being able to teleport around the room to teleport to specific positions around the table, shift from right to left hand, line up your shots, and so on, this just rocks! Extremely well done. Just no real words. It blew me away.All I can say is if you like pool at all and have a Vive, get Pool Nation! I've only played it a short while and can't wait to go back in. And who knows what things open up as you gain achievements and experience or play multiplayer. Just amazing!"
,Recommended,269170,23354776,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Toupee,"This is a killer app for VR, for sure.I grew up with a pool table in our basement, but it's been covered in laundry and laundry baskets for over a decade. I've had to settle for smoky bars with questionable bathrooms to get my 'shark fix. ... for the record, I'm terrible at pool, but I think it's great.If you have any interest at all in pool or VR, this game is for you. In fact, when I heard about it, before I had even purchased the Vive, I was like ""That game ... now that is a good reason to have VR."" And now it's out, and yes. It is.Yeah, you won't be leaning on the side of the pool table to set up your shots. When my roommate and I first booted the game up, I actually got on my knees and yoga'd myself into a tabletop for him to set up his shot. We quickly stopped that though, and not only because it would have been super weird if anyone walked by and looked in the window*, but because the game's clever controls negate the need for you to set your wrist on anything.In 'cue' mode, your two hands are placed naturally upon a pool cue, and squeezing the left hand trigger ""locks"" the angle and position of your stick. Then you can use your right hand to control the speed (and thus power) of your shot. It works wonderfully.You can kneel down and get a line of sight with the cue ball. You can lean all around the table. Walk around it as far as your room-scale setup allows. The teleportation handily locks onto the edge of the table if you aim at it, and always orients you so you're facing a sensible direction. Pro-tip: You can also squeeze both grips to ""pull"" the scenery around you. (This is super weird at first, but actually SUPER useful and I wish more games had this feature.)You're not limited to teleporting just around the table. No no. You have full freedom to roam the bar. The atmosphere really does capture the feeling of a poolshark-type joint, with a bunch of glowing TVs above the bar, a jukebox (which you can lift over your head like a beast, but not load your own music into, unfortunately), darts (and a dartboard to throw at), beer bottles to throw and break, and lots of other fun things to discover. The NPCs are dumb, and don't do anything at all, but entertaining to look at. Partly because they're the dumbest thing in the place.The first night my roommate and I got this we only did the 'free play' mode. We basically just traded wearing the headset every time it was the other person's turn. This worked beautifully, and allowed for lots and lots of sipping a beverage of your choice between shots. (Dev request: please enable this to run in full-screen in mirrored mode! Window is too small!) In general this worked just great. It felt like we actually walked into a bar and just started playing around with a table; there were no rules imposed whatsoever. I DO wish that it showed you which balls were already sunk, or had a basic local scorekeeping mode, but frankly it worked so well that we played for basically five hours. This is by far the most seductive VR game right now; we've easily put more hours into this in a night than anything else yet.That was yesterday. Today, then, this was the first game I booted up after work and I decided to try an online match. It was an absolute blast. I met a stranger who had played a couple more games online than me, but not many. It had this crazy effect that so far I've only experienced in BigScreen, where it really feels like the other person is there with you. I felt my body language shifting like we were both in the room. I found myself gesturing naturally and laughing a LOT. (It could have had something to do with playing with beer bottles in a vulgar way ... nah, it was just everything.)As of this writing, the VR crowd is still so selective. The few people I met when i booted up BigScreen the other night were really cool. Lots of similar interests. I love the idea of the LAN party thing, but we ended up just chilling. Pool Nation VR is even better, because you're actually sharing an activity — a fantastic activity. I almost asked for a friend request from the person I played my first game with... it was just a very natural, very fun, fantastic time.Oh yeah, and the multiplayer gameplay is great. It basically has the scoring system I wanted when I played free play for five hours. And of course you can explore the bar with your buddy and do whatever you want. You're not stuck to the table at all.As far as performance goes, I put it on Low straight away. There's a nifty FPS meter that updates on the settings screen. I have a GTX 970 and an i2500-k, and this game usually hovers in the 80-90 range with my rig. Not a solid 90, unfortunately, but the developers seem to be focusing on performance issues, so I'm hopeful it will be ironed out soon enough. In any case, it's not a dealbreaker at all.The person I was playing with had a 1080 card and he said that on the very highest settings the FPS were poor compared to most anything else he's tried, but again, the devs are looking into it.Anyway, get this game.* Yes, someone did see us playing Vive through the window the other night. They definitely wanted to come in and play. There was that look of longing. Aw, guy, come back. We'll let you play pool for a bit."

Forget all other games, you'll only need this one to truly into VR. It feels like the real thing, Controls are very well done, graphics are great, a bit demanding though. Im running on a 980ti with a 4790k and have to set the graphics to medium or high. Medium is fine, High stutters somewhat, Ultra isn't usable with about 40 frames per second. I would apprecciate if the developers could tweak the engine somewhat more, because it look awsome in ultra and the immersion it the best I've ever seen on my Vive (or even the Rift)This game is a masterpiece for Roomscale VR, it's a must have. I won't say it's a system seller, as pool isn't for everyone, but it's very near that.I feel so much like in a bar playing pool billard, that I often tried to lean on the table, be carefull, you'll fall over onto your nose ;)Sound is good, physics seem very realistic, though the AI is a little bit too good, even at lowest setting it's very hard to beat them.Haven't tried multiplayer yet, I'm satisfied with singleplayer until now. Maybe I'll try multiplayer later, but I hate starting a game and then having to leave it because of real world things, same for the oppenent.If you've got a VIVE and you like Pool Billiard, or want to get a game, that truly makes a use of Roomscale VR, the Controllers and all the stuffe, that makes a VIVE, this is four you!Really, this is 10/10"
,Recommended,269170,23349841,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Nivek TT,"Pool Nation VR works very well. Controls wise, you hold the cue using the two touch controllers and the game feedbacks via red dot and ghost where you're gonna strike the white and where the white will strike the first ball. When you have the cue in position you pull a trigger which locks the cue, you then pull back with one hand and push forward to play the shot. While locked there is some minor adjustment available using the other trigger. Its not a simulation but its very approachable and fun.Your opponent's headset and controllers are visible as a ghost of the equipment which is neat. You can customise yourself with a hat.Also in the bar you can play darts but this is nowhere near so well thought out and polished. Almost impossible to judge aim and strength. May be with some practice but there are no assistances here.The bar looks good and is fun to explore. Managed a steady 45 fps (half of ninety I assume) on high settings from my GTX 970. Most striking difference between high and medium being reflections on the floor. The game feeds back your fps when adjusting settings, nice one! For some reason I seem to be 2 foot taller than all the NPCs. They look and move alright though. Makes me excited for the VR strip club!Hope there are more environments to play in coming, perhaps as DLC."

76561198081783392,Recommended,269170,23348803,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Spirehunter,"TL;DR-This game is my favorite multiplayer experience and is the only game so far to make me forget I'm wearing a headset.I've seen a few threads about it already, but I wanted to make my own in hopes of persuading anyone still on the fence about it. The more people in multiplayer, the better.I loaded up the game not expecting much. It's a billiards simulator, how great could it be? Luckily, it was not what I was expecting, as I was smiling pretty much the whole time. The billiards hall is pretty big and you can teleport almost everywhere. The hall itself has more activities than pool, such as darts, dominoes, and breaking bottles. You could also try flirting with some of the ai's, but I guess I wasn't their type, as they just ignored me.After messing around with the various activities scattered about the hall, I decided to dive into the meat of things, the billiards table. Due to haptic feedback, hitting the cue ball feels great and breaking is just as satisfying as in real life. Walking around the table felt so natural! You can teleport to any part of the tale by clicking the edge or, by using your side triggers, you can push and pull your play space. Luckily, my play space is 4mx3m, so once I had the table centered, I could walk all around it without having to worry about my chaperone bounds. This greatly added to my immersion. At one point I actually began to lean on the table while taking a break, but caught myself before I fell. This is the first game that's made me forget I was wearing a headset.Once I got comfortable with the table controls, I decided to hop online. It was late here in California, so I wasn't sure if anyone else would be online. I joined an empty room and went back to messing around with bottles and chairs. After a few minutes I hear a noise behind me. ""Hey man, what's up?"" I turn around and there's a pair of floating controllers and a vive headset. I wave at him and he waves back at me. ""Here, have a drink!"" I reply, as I place one of the bottles I had spawned in front of him. We both laugh and start shooting some pool. I talk to him while we play and it turns out he's from New York and just like me, he's been staying up very late ever since getting his Vive. Halfway though the game we start messing around with putting bottles and chairs on the table. It doesn't affect the balls, but the balls will push the furniture around, so it's pretty entertaining to see. At some point I see my opponent wander over to one of the dart board. I follow him and we play a few round of darts, after which we go back to the table and finish our game. I won, we said good game, and with that, he waved and vanished.This whole thing was such a great experience. It really feels like your playing with someone in the same room. I can't wait to play some more and get some unlockables. All in all, Pool Nations VR was such an awesome experience. It's definitely a game I'll be adding to my Vive demos when people are over."

I do, however have a few suggestions that I think would make the game better:Absolutely Needed:----------------------------1) Implement varying rulesets, or allow customization of the rules (ie: in US 8-ball, non-break fouls result in ball-in-hand only behind the head string, and the target must be on the opposite side of the head string)2) The ""locking"" system really needs to use both triggers.  The trigger on the bridge hand should lock in the contact point on the cue ball, but leave the grip hand free to adjust the shooting angle without losing your desired contact point on the cue ball.  The trigger on the grip hand should lock in the shooting angle.""Nice To Have""-----------------------------1) Make the ""dummies"" more reactive to what's going on around them.  Make them duck or yell ""ow"" or something if you throw objects at them.2) I haven't checked to see if this exists, but the ability to import your own music or load an internet radio stream into the jukebox would be nice.3) Darts is kinda weird-feeling, not the fault of the developers, but rather the difference between how you hold a dart vs how you hold the Vive controllers.  Maybe add something else like Air Hockey or Foosball?4) Implement Cutthroat (a 3-player pool game)"

Great pool physics and effortless control of hitting the cue ball as well as getting around the table to take a shot. Graphics look really nice even on low, which I prefer so I can supersample (in the actual game menu) to 2.0 with my 1070. The pool hall looks really cool to just move around in. Highly recommended"

Been thinking about picking this up for some time and im very glad i finally have.Needs euro balls and ill be a very happy chappy if the devs add this.As everyone else says, dont lean on the table... Its pretty tempting to do this as you really do think you're there.Its an easy 8/10 (would be more if it had euro 8 ball).UPDATE December 15thAwesome update to the now Sports Bar VR. The physics are the best so far in vr and everything feels natural. A must try is the toy gun (you need to spawn one), shooting objects with this is very rewarding ;)The chess table is very nice and works well, i have yet to try online but its looking like ill spend many hours on this.9.2/10"

Kind of like having your own personal pool table. The darts and air hockey are great too. Only thing I would suggest is maybe give players an option to change the music and be able to stream video to the flat screen TV's hanging on the wall.

(the place really needs to implement real physics pinball machines) The games all play damn near perfectly, (air hocky in particular feels almost exactly like in real life) though something seems wonky with my perspective in billards. I'm not an ace player on anything, but something about the perspective CONSTANTLY throws off my aim for every shot.I still have yet to meet any real players though. I'll try inviting a friend through steam and I'll update this review once I see how that works."

Multiplayer works well, although I found that if you join a multiplayer game I could not hear any music or bar chatter.

The physics are solid and the AI skill levels are accurate to the settings and they play like a real person. This makes for a good single player experience.The darts are ok BUT they are hard to see when they are in the board. There is a clear score displayed above the board so that is good but I want to see the darts in the board. I suggested they fix that on the community threads. I like the method the dev used for throwing the darts with the controller. You don't have to be a darts expert to play AND you will get better at it as you go. Good move.The Ski ball is good.  I'm not feeling like the ball is going where I roll it. Hard to develop a skill with this as it is. Physics are off. I have a feeling this will get better with feedback and the devs efforts.All this said I am having great fun with SportsBar VR. The dev seems interested in making the entire game better and better. That is good too. So I give them and SportsBar VR a thumbs up.

,Recommended,269170,29028137,Posted: 4 January,all,Shmulzi,"The game at its current state would be worth buying at a sale.I'm saying this because on one hand the client itself is done right. Everything works smoothly and is responsive, graphics are nice, physics are amazing for each game, and the bot ai is also challenging.On the other hand, the server side, the multiplayer side, is not on the same level at all. When it rarely works well its great and can lead to some very unique and fun situations. But most often players (if you find any) will disconnect every few minutes, everything lags and jumps around, air hockey is just unplayable, so is the ramp ball... very poor performance reported by me and any player i interacted with. I tried addressing this in the discussion boards but devs are not responding.TL;DR;Game is great as a single player experience, average to bad as a multiplayer experience due to technical issues."

,Recommended,269170,28500886,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,Laboriax,"Great concept. The air hockey is pretty impressive and matches the real experience minus the weight of the paddle of cause. The paddle felt a little laggy but did not impinge on the experience much. The  pool is really good but a little awkward moving around as my Vive's wires and my limited space got in the way a bit.  The darts was a little difficult to play as it did not replicate the real experience in any way for me. Darts appeared too small for one, had to throw really hard and did not have much accuracy.    I had a little difficulty seeing the darts that were thrown and seeing them on the board.The graphics resolution overall was a little grainy and could be much crisper. I at least hoped for a visual experience similar to serious sam vr.  This definately needs improvement as I found it difficult to read unless I really centred the headset."

I got this game back when it was ""PoolNation VR"", and it's seen a lot of changes since then.  The only downside is that it does seem impossible to get a a game going from the lobby currently, but I like playing solo vs the AI anyway.  I didn't get the game to play with strangers, I just wanted to feel like I'm playing pool.   And even the easiest AI is a pretty tough player, but the AI's difficulty is adjustable.  I'd say it is very likely I've put more hours into this game than any of my other VR games.  And they just added a custom playlist to the jukebox!  So there will continue to be many, many more hours into this game for me.  It was definitely worth the price as far as I'm concerned."

Don't get me wrong, the presentation is amazing and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into making the game look great and for the game to play out fluently. The main problem I have with it is that many of these games (and sports bars in general) are supposed to cater to the lazy type (like myself) but in the absence of actual tables and chairs, your emersion is broken as soon as you tire out. What breaks your emersion further is these creepy low resolution CGI humans, who just waddle around with blank expressions. Meanwhile, the ACTUAL humans who you play with online are just floating hats without bodies or faces. I can’t tell which is creapier.Only giving it a thumbs up because there is no in-between rating and I don't have the heart to thumbs down something that brims with such effort."
,Recommended,269170,33820905,Posted: 26 July,all,Baphomet,"Sports Bar VR (formerly Pool Nation VR) is an immersive take on sports bars except without the obnoxious patrons and atmosphere. Originally this was just a pool table sim but the devs decided to expand the game to include darts, skee ball, air hockey, shuffleboard?, and there’s even a chess table. The pool part of the game works very well and you can even put English on the cue ball or jump it over other balls for elaborate trick shots.Now, all this game needs is a community. Be warned that you may be stuck playing the AI (which is relegated to the pool table alone) unless you happen to have some VR friends to invite or the stars align and someone from the small playerbase floats into your hosted game."
