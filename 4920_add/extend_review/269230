As a description, I have only this: imagine a world in which Platinum Games teamed up with Treasure to make a brawler with surprising depth, tons of enemies on screen, and a dog that explodes into a cloud of ninjas. If you like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, River City Ransom, Double Dragon, or fun and don't buy this game, I don't know what to tell you."

The game has a million reward mechanics and only 'punishes' you by not being the awesomest you can be.Nothing feels more badass than lining up the perfect Crash Charge and obliterating an entire room doing 350+damage to everyone when your normal rapid attacks only do 3-5 per hit.Nothing feels more badass than dashing down a hall, bullets, missiles and kunai being thrown at you, dodging for the half second to weave through, then dashing down it again and again.Nothing feels more badass when fighting a boss, health a literal sliver with a max wild bar, fulling knowing that one Crash Charge will lead to victory and a miss is utter epic defeat.Nothing feels more badass than buying this insane masterpiece of a game."

With the decline of arcades and the birth of new genres in 3d, the popularity of beat 'em ups waned, making way for new gaming zeitgeists. In recent years the 2D beat-em up has settled for reboots of classics with little success, luckily the love for the genre burns in the hearts of indie developers and with this, Aces Wild Manic Brawling Action comes to life. Does this beat 'em up deliver a first round knock out punch or does it throw the towel?Taking control of the title character Aces Wild, who must participate in this year's Maximus Circuit in an attempt to preserve the lands held by the Wilder Family. His brother Rex has struck a deal with key entrants of the tournament to ensure his victory so he can sell the lands for a hefty sum. In classic beat 'em up tradition, the story stops there allowing you to pummle your way through the games stages without narrative interruption.Aces Wild's obvious key focus is it's stylized fast paced aerial combat. The controls consist of a light and heavy attack which are linked to the wild meter located at the top left corner of the screen. The meter fills up with every light attack landed increasing the potency of all your attacks. It's also used for health recovery, and charged attacks. This simple idea creates a system in which managing your wild meter become crucial. You'll find yourself debating on whether to use it for a quick heal, full on charge attack or conserving it just a bit longer for an array of potent light attacks. It's becomes a game of it's own that I was very impressed with, seeing as how simple it was. The three selectable character also bring a distinct combat style to the table, each with their unique skill set. If you find yourself in a bind consider a new route by selecting another character.The combat is a bitter sweet. While it is mechanically solid, the level design and enemy encounters undermine it's strengths. One minute you'll feel like you're part of a knuckle sandwich catering service and the next you'll find yourself beaten, battered and tossed out on your♥♥♥♥♥like an unruly patron at a biker bar. This often becomes a one sided affair in the later stages when the screen is cluttered with enemies, and one missed dodge results in ten enemy hits. A handful of sword, fists and draggers to the face is a high price to pay for missing one dodge in a cluttered an chaotic melee where sometimes the greatest challenge is keeping track of where your character is among the action. Enemies moves don't necessarily evolve either, spamming becomes their game and it becomes extremely irritating when the difficulty is ramped up by cluttering the screen with enemies instead of providing a clever mix of foes that complement one another's attacks and patterns.Boss battles continue the trend of being frustrating. Like their lesser counterparts, they have a bit of a penchant for spamming the same attacks again and again creating very narrow windows in which to land attacks. Small mistake and missed dodges are also punished severely. Earlier bosses are formidable at first but quickly become a joke as you learn their patterns. Later encounters ramp up completely taking much of the fun away as they become tedious and ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Knowing what to do is one thing but succeeding is another when everything consuming the screen seems to be at the right spot to put a hurting on you. All is slightly remedied though, as you can select any stage whenever, infinite lives, and the instant respawn with full health after a loss. Still, consider having a pillow at arms reach to smack around when anger consumes you.Leaderboards have recently been added for those looking to ascend them and local mutiplayer is available if you and friend want to tackle the challenge as a team. Co-op play isn't all that exciting though, other then adding a second player on screen the game is exactly the same. If played on a small screen the zooming in and out of the screen can be a pain, making it even more difficult to keep up with what is going on. Unless you have a large monitor and two controllers at hand consider passing on this feature.Aces Wild channels the style of late 90's Capcom fighting games and side scrolling titles with the interface and the character design, but is a bit lacking when it comes to detail. Many of the environments feel lifeless and static. There are few interactive objects. Generally, stages are constructed with backdrop layered with platforms that are crisp and clean but lacking in personality or style. A more dynamic environment could easily add another layer to the static world of Aces Wild and pay better homage to a genre where using objects in the environment as weapons has been a long standing staple. There's also a dearth of detail missing throughout all the characters with little to no animation involved. Fortunately, the soundtrack is well done delivering some fantastic 16bit tracks and sounds.The foundation of a great game are definitely here but the overall experience becomes a bit repetitive as the variation in enemies and environment do little to evolve along the way. Aces Wild is a tough game with some infuriating segments, there is no escaping the anger along the ride, but it's the nature of the beast. If it gets a sequel, an upgrade system is an obvious request, along with some improved visuals. Aces Wild Manic Brawling Action is a large dose of nostalgia for a great price, if you're up for a beat-em up and a challenge pick it up when you have the urge. But remember, keep a pillow at arms reach.6.9"

Since its Humble Store release I've spent dozens and dozens of hours playing, and my time with this game is far from over.The controls are easy to pickup but are incredibly precise. You can do crazy combos and fly around the screen with your aerial-powered fighter using a minimal amount of buttons.The game is challenging but fair. Cliche statement, yes, but true in the case of Aces Wild. Nothing that the game throws at you is outside is unbeatable if you've got the skill.Do you want a score-attack focused game without those annoying unlockables or DLC? All the content in Aces Wild is available to play from the get go. Do you want to jump straight to the final boss on hardest difficulty? Go for it! It's all good!Lastly, and possibly what Aces Wild does best, is how much you can simply improve playing the game and how rewarding that feels. The skill ceiling in Aces Wild is absurdly high, and playing through the five difficulties gives a gradual learning curve instead of creating brick walls to bash your head on. Soon enough you'll be flying through dozens if not hundreds of attacks each minute, crashing your fists/swords against enemies so hard *it kills everything nearby*In short, this game is incredibly challenging, incredibly deep, and incredibly great.

,Recommended,269230,30777719,Posted: 27 March,all,ErbanVision,Aces Wild: Manic Brawling Action! is an interested game filed with chaotic action.There isn't much of a story other than win and defeat everyone.At first i was not enjoying Ace Wild i felt that it was unbalanced. However when i discover that you could doge attack than it became more about skill. So i started enjoy the challenge that the game had to offerUnfortunately the game is kinda simplistic in its design and once you have seen all the level that the game has to offer the chances are that you will not comme back to play this game again.There also is not much variety in the enemy types it does not hinder the experience but more would of been appreciated. Boss are hard and punishing but there is a fun factor in defeating them. One of the high points of Ace Wild is the retro soundtrack. It's really good and puts the player in the mood to destroy your enemy.Sadly Ace Wild is a really short Game my first run of the game took me 1h30 to completed it.In 2017 Ace Wild suffers from big optimisation problem with windows 10 and with the Steam ControllerThe steam controller will crash the game and to get this game working you will need to set Ace Wild in compatibility mode Windows Xp or Windows 7. But with that said the steam page does inform the consumer that this game was optimised for Windows Xp so i would not blame the dev for that.7.5/10 Verdict: There is some fun to be had with Ace Wild but the game has aged in it's 4 year that it was released on Steam. Since then so many other indie games have released and the optimisation problems that it has grown to have make it hard to recommend at a full price purchase.

I can easily say I would've payed regular price for it. With its fast-paced and frantic gameplay, flashy combat, increasingly brutal difficulty with increasingly ruthless enemies, Aces Wild delivers! To give you an idea of what you're in for, Aces Wild is the Serious Sam of side-scrolling brawlers: wave after wave of mass enemy attacks and short moments of reprive in-between. It's occasionally rage-inducing but always addictive. You even have the option to tackle the world with a friend with its drop-in co-op; which is great because in Aces Wild you will definitely need all the help you can get! There's even a Boss Rush mode for anyone gutsy enough to take on the game's cruel bosses all in a row.Flashy. Frantic. Manic. Challenging. Addicting. Amazing.

,Not Recommended,269230,15029911,"Posted: 23 March, 2015",all,it's miscu,"This is a rewrite of a previously positive review I wrote, mainly just because this game starts off with an incredible amount of potential off the bat but squanders it by keeping your combat options too simple for the very steep difficulty ramp-up.You have a dodge button, a dash, a basic combo attack, a chargeable heavy attack, and a ""panic"" button that lets you eat your own combo meter to get health back (which is a pretty clever idea). Countering with the dodge will let you follow up with a light or heavy counter depending on which button you press.The best way to describe this game's problem is, imagine if a game like Bayonetta never introduced Wicked Weaves, dodge-offsetting, or anything else beyond the basic set of mechanics, and your whole strategy has to revolve around abusing Witch Time so you can lead up with button mash combo spam. In order to make itself more difficult, it just throws more and more high-tier enemies onto the screen to the point of being a giant chaotic mess where you spend more time dodging the onslaught than actually attacking your enemies.It's weird in that the skill ceiling is very low, but it's very difficult, just in a way that doesn't entirely feel fair. You're limited to the same process of spamming dodge and the combo button, with the occasional heavy attack for health sponge enemies. Because the difficulty curve becomes so unforgiving, it highlights how shallow the actual combat system is.Also one of the 3 playable characters is flat-out more powerful than the other two to an absurd extent, like he's supposed to be a secret unlockable character but they just give you him at the start so there's little point in picking anyone else.There's so, so much potential here and I'll occasionally load up the first stage just to be reminded of why I initially had hopes for the game, but by stage 3 or 4 it becomes a painful repetitive slog. It's a real shame."

Arrow keys are completely ignored, as is the mouse.Keyboard setup is handled so badly that it's practically guaranteed to screw up your controls so badly that you have to dig around in the game's files and delete the configuration. This is one of those ""go down the list and assign every single command"" kinds of setups. Escape is registerred as an input during this, presumably so you can immediately start screwing things up. If you get past that and are successfully inputting your controls, you will then notice that the movement commands are at the very bottom of the list. Some VERY LOGICAL alternatives people could use for movement are the arrow keys or the numpad's arrows. Except those aren't recognized by this game. So then you're stuck having to navigate menus with some random set of keys (or giving up and deleting the config. Again) until you can reconfigure them.I've been encountering this kind of thing in a lot of games lately, and it seriously needs to stop. I don't care if a game ""plays better"" on a controller. That is no excuse to cripple the experience of keyboard users. When the menus alone are enough to cause a rage quit before the player has even gotten to the game itself, THAT IS A PROBLEM."

It does get very difficult.  I'm not really sure if the AI is really good, but this game does take the ""more enemies, the more difficult"" approach, so...The game has 3 characters you can choose from, all with different styles.  Ace, the star of the game, uses punches and kicks, while the two other characters use swords (but still play differently).  Not sure at this time if you can unlock more characters.  If you like brawlers, combo systems, and lookin' flashy, this game is for you."

Sure if Platinum made ghastly awful games with no concept of frame data, movement, or enemy design.In a world where the total button count is six, you have all melee attacks, and nearly every enemy is long range. A world where attacks exist off screen so that you can run into them as they appear on screen for 4 frames if you're lucky. A world where your damage values are miniscule, the enemies damage values are much larger, your HP is tiny and enemy's HP are damage sponges. You are meant to exhibit completely nonsensical movement, flying through the air as though no physics exist, and can even propel yourself from mashing the rapid attack button. HOWEVER, if there is any set dressing of any kind in the way, such as a street light or even a warehouse light hanging from the ceiling, you and only you are inhibited by it. Enemies can counter themselves into ceilings, out of view, and attack you through solid objects. Did I mention the offensive amount of projectile spam?

I managed to beat him in one try, ffs.The flying directions after a major hit need to be more predictable/deterministic; I never felt like I truly got a good grip on the mechanics because of its seemingly random nature. When a bunch of tougher enemies were on-screen and I had full meter, I just used it all up on the nearest enemy, insta-killed them, and then watched as my most recent victim's corpse bounced around and increased my body count by proxy.That's another REALLY annoying thing: While the difficulty does increase over time, a good chunk of it is due to higher defense values amongst enemies. It seems like the devs couldn't find another way to raise the stakes than to make enemies eat more hits before being able to actually be stunned. This is especially a shame, because some of my favorite moments involved beating out opponent parries with my own, an event that could've manifested itself as its own boss.Also, there REALLY needs to be SOME sort of progression/higher amount of content: All characters and levels are available from the word ""Go"", and you don't get any upgrades. This is pretty unfortunate, because the game could benefit from a larger player arsenal, which would allow for more combos and, in a few cases after a major reworking, better control of the enemies' flying directions (Particularly by way of having player upgrade attacks move the player in a certain direction, like an Akuma-esque dropkick, that also moves the enemy upon contact).All in all, an ok game with pretty good challenge and a fair amount of skill involved, but to say it needs more work and more in general is an understatement.7/10"

It's clearly trying to be like something made by Treasure and for a while, it really feels like it succeeds in doing this. The core parts of the game feel great, but there's just too many things letting it down.Those core parts work really well - the movement and combat are simple while having a decent amount of depth. Rapid attacks build up the 'Wild' meter, which is used for both charged attacks and restoring health. It provides an interesting balance that adds a nice risk/reward element. The combat is fun and satisfying when it works out.Unfortunately, there's a lot dragging this game down. There are only about five types of enemies, with a couple variations on each. This might not be a big deal if the fights felt like they were carefully designed, but later levels usually throw more enemies in at once. One missed dodge can lead to taking a string of hits and losing a large chunk of health. Boss battles have similar issues. Plenty of things simply feel too unforgiving or even unfair. If there was more variety in enemies along with more carefully designed fights, it could be a great game. It just ends up being difficult for dumb reasons, which is a shame because it has a lot of potential."

76561198048680495,Recommended,269230,11292703,"Posted: 17 July, 2014",all,adamphilipps123,"A good game that could have been a fantastic game.If you ever wanted to play a 2d version of a game like DMC or Bayonetta, this is probably the exact game you’re looking for, but have never heard of. Aces wild is an interesting mix up between crazy action beat um up, and old school side scrolling beat um up, That does the former much better than it does the latter.It’s crazy to think that an Indy made game like this, could have out classed so many games made by major publishers, if it weren’t for a few key features missing from it’s incredibly fluid, over the top play style. The games basic controls consist of two main attacks, a dash, and a guard, The light attack button is your standard combo attack, and the other is the heavy crash attack button. The game also has an extremely interesting mechanic that holds it all together, called wild meter. The wild meter fills up as you preform combos. The fun thing about it is that it has a large variety of uses, wild can be used for preforming crash attacks, for charging  crash attacks, crash counters, extended dashing, and activating “panic”. Not only this, but the more wild you have the more base damage your combos do, which constantly keeps you thinking about how much wild you spend as opposed to keeping it in to do more combo damage to your enemy’s. Also unlike a lot of other games, all of these skills are essential to master, and none of them feel pointless. The game has a great deal of enemy variety, all of which demand a different way of fighting. The weaker foes in the game can be mowed down with basic combos, but it gets really tricky when you have to fight enemies who are not affected by hit stun because of their shields, or enemy’s that spam projectiles, and others that counter. The game makes you think about what enemy’s you want to prioritize, as well as what you want to use your wild on. Sometimes it will be more beneficial to fight a good long fight while dogging all incoming attacks mixing up your basic, and crash attacks to gain wild faster. Or sometimes it will be better rolling into the part of the level, and destroying everything with one fully charged crash attack, causing all your enemy’s to knock into each other at full force. Or you just might want to play it safe till you get enough wild to use a panic, which restores a great deal of health depending on how much wild you have.Another huge part of the games great combat, is how the dashing and dogging work so well, it never gets old watching your enemy’s fly to the other side of the screen, and catching right up to them, in a split second just to keep the beat down going, then sending the body whirling into the rest of the enemy’s. It also serves as a great tool to catch, and pummel many of the bosses before they are able to perform an attack, if they don’t have a guard up. It’s also nice to see that dogging has an extended window of invincibility which makes it easier to preform counters which comes in handy to beating most of the games earlier foes. The game does a fantastic job at keeping the action going even at some of its more chaotic points, dashing around preforming a combo, finishing a guy of and diving right into the rest of the group with a fully charged crash attack is satisfying. The game is a complete joy to play, and delivers on making the player feel like a badass, as the action never breaks, till the last few stages.Unfortunately as much as I want to gush about the games combat it has some extremely large draw backs as the game moves on. Now it should be said that these games are difficult by nature, but towards the end of the game, you can be punished with death for the slightest mistakes. It’s all fun and games till you have around one hundred enemies on screen, and twenty of them are throwing projectiles at you, making it look more like a smup than a beat um up. At this stage one missed dodge will open you up to a fifty or more hit combo taking half your life away, only to wind up in the same position less than a second later because you failed to take out any enemies, because they were too busy styling all over your face. It’s also not fun to run into twenty or so enemy’s that all have shields, and aren’t affected by hit stun, and are essentially invulnerable, while they mercilessly hack away at you. In fights like these, the games mechanics begin to break down. Counters become worthless; with only limited invincibility leaving you open to punishment after only killing a few guys. And crash attacks become almost unusable, as you may never get even the one second it takes to charge them up to guard break. And even if you do, it’s easy to wiff, and wastes your entire wild meter on noting, while you put your controller down, and get styled on into oblivion. Just whiffing a crash attack at certain times can spell instant death, because you may not get a good chance to gain enough wild back to guard break. The games main problem is that it doesn’t include any kind of upgrade system that is seen in any of the games 3d counter parts. The game makes itself into a perfect example of, why such things are needed in a manic brawler. Being able to customize how you fight keeps it so you can keep playing the game the way you want to play, instead of the game playing you, as you are forced to conform to enemy patterns, or die. It would have been fantastic to put points into the counter mechanic so that you could remain invincible while you perform a crash counter, so you know you’re not going to burn your entire wild meter for nothing. Being able to upgrade key mechanics is a must for games like this, 3d or 2d. It just can’t stay true to its old school arcade street brawler roots, where you don’t get any kind of upgrades, and you have to rely on basic mechanics. If things stay to basic, the enemy verity begins to cap out at a point, and you end up with a game that just poor’s on the hurt to artificially extend its length.Another one of the games sore spots is its presentation it’s environments are clean, but dull, character animation’s outside of aces, are very poor, and aces are very lacking, and enemy designs are very hit or miss. You only get two playable characters with only minor differences. The game is only about seven to eight hours long, and the game has no reliability, or online play at all. However the music is pretty good for the most part. Over all it’s an amazing game at its core, I’ve never played a 2d game as fast nor as furious as this one, but its un polished no matter where you look at it. 7/10"

76561198078317925,Recommended,269230,22318041,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,IN OPTIONS,"Its an easy to get into beat em up. Rather than complex combos, you really just have one combo that you mash over and over, but doing this builds your potential to do more damage over time as well as cash it out for gigantic burst damage. The dodge mechanic is nice for the bullet hell style gameplay, and you cant just spam dodge to win, which is nice. Yeah, an over the top bullet hell beat em up, that pretty much sums up how fun this sounds. Again, Its really easy to get into, and even harder to not crack a smile while playing. The soundtrack is chiptune, which may or may not be your taste. But as someone who can enjoy chiptune, I thought the soundtrack was pretty solid. For a traditional art style, the animations are very smooth and match the hitboxes of your attacks very well. My ONLY complaint is that my favorite playable character is a reskin of a common enemy, and that can lead to losing track of where you are while playing him; However, you can change the palette, which helps quite a bit with that.TL;DRits a gud one, a hidden gem, even. ESPECIALLY for 10 bucks."
