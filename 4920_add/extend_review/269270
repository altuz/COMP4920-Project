,Recommended,269270,17437895,"Posted: 7 August, 2015",all,Flare,"I was suckered in by the tag Great Soundtrack. It seems I'm in the minority who doesn't agree the soundtrack is all that fantastic. The platforming is mildly well designed at best, and certainly doesn't hold a candle up to a game like Super Meat Boy, for instance. There definitely aren't enough levels to keep me coming back for too long.Well, for all that I have to gripe about it, it's still only $3, and I bought it at $1 in a sale, so frankly for the price tag there's very little to complain about. You still get a good amount of entertainment for your money, and the one song in the soundtrack worth the tag Great Soundtrack is indeed Great. Take a listen to Kid, it's well worth your time."
,Recommended,269270,11507460,"Posted: 1 August, 2014",all,coldfrog,"This game is platforming at its most basic.  The controls are exactly what they need to be for making almost but not quite pixel-perfect jumps, and the graphics, while hardly the best, offer a few well-designed visual backgrounds and are always functional enough to let you recognize what will kill you and what dangers are ahead.  The levels are well designed with just enough trickiness to offer potential traps but that the Single Life mode seems (at least to me) very much possible, some day, with enough practice.  And the levels are also fun, which I think is the most important part.  They are all very memorable in at least one way, and offer a variety of challenges.  They are good enough that I feel it is worth playing through the speedrun mode, and playing multiple rounds to attempt to reach A++ scores.Basically, it is a well-crafted challenge platformer that is beatable by probably most people but also offers enough challenges that people will want to come back to it repeatedly, and is short enough that a full game is not a huge time sink and failing does not prohibit you from coming back and playing again because you felt like you spent too much time on it.  I would rank it better than average, and well worth the very low price of entry."

It's just pure platforming.The game has five different modesArcade Mode:You have 100 lives and an unlimited number of checkpoints.Easy Mode:You have unlimited lives, but you score less points.YOLO Mode:You only get one life.Speedrun Mode:You have to try and beat the game as fast as possible.Remix Mode:8 additional remixed levels.The main game has 16 levels, while Remix Mode offers 8 additional remixed levels. All of which are short, but moderately challenging. There are a lot of indie platformers out there that are ridiculously hard. This one offers a challenge, but doesn't feel impossible to beat. Unless of course, you're playing on YOLO mode. That really does feel impossible at times. As I said, the game is short. There's even an achievement for completing the speedrun in under 12 minutes. That should give you an idea of the length of this game. Still, it took me a little over 5 hours to get 18/19 achievements. It's also worth noting that the soundtrack is fantastic.Conclusion:If you're a fan of platformers, I'd definitely recommend this. It's a short game, but it's well worth the price it's listed. If you're looking for a story, this doesn't have one. However, if you just want a good platformer that's moderately challenging, I think you'll enjoy it."

,Recommended,269270,13679177,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,ULEX,"Although Love is a short game and isn't particularly difficult to beat, there's something about the way the art style, music, and game mechanics all work together that makes it quite memorable and fun to play. Your little sprite has a breezy running motion that makes certain sections feel quite fluid, the level design is simple and attractive, and the soundtrack is alternately calming and tense. The bright colours and rows of spikes gave me VVVVVV vibes sometimes too.As for replay value, the scoring/rank system gives you some incentive to try for more challenging playthroughs, and the YOLO and speedrunning modes offer different options as well. The ability to select individual levels to play (after you beat the game) is particularly useful for practise.Overall this is one of my favourite games aesthetically, and I always end up spending a little more time on it than I intend to. It's short enough that it doesn't feel like a big commitment, but has enough little achievements that it can appeal to those with a perfectionist streak too."

Though I'm not entirely sure about ""a focus on a challenging difficulty"", the controls were wonderfully consistent and responsive, which I imagine is exactly what you want out of a precision platformer. I never once had a death in this game that I could blame on anything but myself. And that's how it should be, really.I'm far from an expert on precison platforming, but that feeling of actually being in control is exactly what I'd want out of a skill-based game. The simplicity of the gameplay helps a lot, of course.Very short, and though the level editor does help, a better level creation interface and/or Steam Workshop support would be nice. However, a game that's short and to the point and doesn't overstay its welcome is better than a long game that gets really redundant and boring after a while.+very responsive controls+purely skill-based, no impossible timing or luck orunreasonablyprecise jumps+reasonable length+level creation feature (not really a level editor, exactly, you just need to edit a collection of gifs to make a level)+nice soundtrack-could have used additional more difficult levels-visual style is a bit inconsistent (especially the weird backgrouns in the later levels), and ""retro"" has been done to death-no Steam Workshop support(Bought this game on a sale for two bucks, but all in all I'd say it could be worth three.)7/10"

Indeed, it is quite the short game, as I was able to complete it in one session, about a half hour long. That said though, I'm a believer in quality over quantity. I've noticed this game to be quite difficult, as I lost most of my lives in my playthrough, but it wasn't impossibly nor frustratingly difficult. Perhaps it was a lovely music or nostalgia from old-school gaming that took frustration away. I'm someone who grow up with the old games, so I think this is a nice trip back to the past, but with a few modern things added to it to give it a bit more flavor. All in all, I enjoyed my session with this game and wouldn't mind giving it another go eventually, whether on a day I'm just bored and want some fun or have a challenge at going at the game with just one life."

Simple platforming.This is exactly how LOVE shines. Despite garnering somewhat of a reputation for being difficult, it is fair and surprisingly humble. There are no nasty tricks in any of the levels; what you see and anticipate is what you get. The game is minimalistic in its pixel appearance, but quickly apparent that it's not in any cliché sense of retro appeal. It is a subtly stylish game that excels in presenting simple, clean platforming concepts through bite-sized, themed levels. LOVE is even confident enough in its design to allow for manual checkpoint placement in every level, and it works. I have to add that the soundtrack is also pretty fantastic, and helps LOVE maintain a fascinating, enigmatic atmosphere alongside the deliberately minimal visuals.LOVE is short yet succinct, and a great deal for the price it asks."

Since the game is fairly short and every run goes through the same levels in the same order with the same obstacles, this is an excellent game for speedruns and competitions, even giving you a dedicated Speedrun mode.This game may be easy to learn to play, but it's quite tricky to master. You especially need timing, precision and patience if you wanna get through without dying all too much. Considering you are not playing YOLO mode (you only have one life throughout the entire run), you can however put a checkpoint at all times except when you are in the air or bouncing. But placing fewer checkpoints also increases your end score, same goes with dying.I was actually really damn suprised what a fun game this actually is, especially for that price you get a pretty good deal."

Probably a self aware joke when you attempt yolo mode where you will love the gameafter installing the one game on a crappy computer, put it in a field and work for enough money to hire an orbital missle strike. I wanted something good for a normal afternoon on a 5am while trying to postpone my sleep deprivation and to stop the voices in my head saying that I have a problem, so I blissfuly ignore them to continue my rampaging nihilistic ways.gameplayYou just move, jump and get your way over to the end of the level, avoiding the hazards with what looks like a thing with maths for a head. So what do you want me to say, but lets not get too deep into this review like a poorly implimented sex joke. The level design is not too bad, and it's even better that its properly designed for the controls, albeit sonic 06 ('shruders').the game does have a 'make your own checkpoint' which is 'so original'.and definetly not made by anyone elsebut in summary, the gameplay is adequete and more importantly 'FUN' to play, its nothing new and it knows that so it brings somthing more interesting to gouge your eyes out in a way you like, you creep.atmosphereThe games artstye looks like a 40 year old dos user playing mario world on acid. Its actually looks kinda pretty with its basic artstyle and its limited use of pixel art, without using it for the obviouse lazynes. Some of the levels are made to look like a portrait like the part where you go through the bowels of a deformed monster.The level design always brings something new that differentiates itself. Even the hazards and platforms act differently to help violently stuff the tiny bag of simple controls and gameplay. So the level design is as pretty as its controls well in platforming. Theres even different kinds of music for each platform section you will force the small thing to run through for your sadistic pleasures. Nothing to make you sing until you bash your head against a wall to stop the awesomeness, but nice all together.conclusionThe level design and gameplay is good as it needs to be to grab our attention 180 degrees in a violent neck snap. the price is a little steep so you should probably buy it on a 50% sale to starve of your crippling depression for games.I have seen better gameplay with simple controls as well and it's called'fancy pants'. I'll sum the game up in fifteen words 'it's a free platformer and moving in this game is as good as an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'. Im not saying its a bad game, you should definetly get it on sale if your into platformers. I actually want to see the dude or dudet who is responsible for the creation of this game, and might buy the next game that they release."

LOVE is fantastic in both its playability and its simplicity.  There are only two buttons and the directional pad/stick.  One button is for jumping and the other is to place your spawn point.  LOVE plays like any platformer except that you can place your respawn point at any location your character is on screen.  This is helpful as the the platforming is on the level of Super Meat Boy.  It’s fair but incredibly precise, requiring perfect timing.  The music in LOVE is fantastic. It’s loud, beat heavy, and appropriate to the frantic and epic platforming gameplay.  The soundtrack is good enough to warrant play outside the game.  For how simple LOVE is it makes for great platforming gameplay. I fully recommend this game.

Of course, the real fun is going through it and trying to better your score, so YMMV- There is one level where it's possible to set a respawn point and make the game unwinnable.

The music is comforting and relaxing and the deaths do not punish you as any level platform you can set your respawn on with no penalty to gameplay. I played it with my 7yr old son who picked up each levels mechanics so fast it surprised me seeing him finish a few levels when I was playing was a great experience.The levels look simple, accuracy is the key and the layer movement is totally in your hands allowing you to correct the trajectory as you go (which also means, when you die it is your fault, and not rage inducing).  The aesthetics are perfectly suited to the game and I have enjoyed this a lot more than I feel I would have.If you are after a fun platformer that will reward your persistence and attention to the levels, this should draw you in. Super Meat Boy is a comparison but I don't feel it is a fair one as SMB relishes punishing you at every turn to make you respawn and repeat (giving you surprise and cheap feeling deaths) this on the other hand has few of these so far and the mechanics feel solid.I played this with a 360 gamepad and controls were perfect, the sense of movement really felt spot on and accurate."

Finally picked it up for under a buck, and I gotta say I am quite dissapointed for even that low of a price. This is something I would expect to be a free flash game. It tries hard. I mean the effort is there, but because it is soooo directly comparable to many other games, it falls seriously short. I mean the soundtrack is ok in places, but overall meh. The platforming is easy, and very standard. This game brings *nothing* new to the genre. I just wish it weren't so flippin' similiar to VVVVVV (which is pure art).I also question the odd developement decision to make the suicide one button, and the respawn set two. Did anyone really need a suicide button? I never used it, but I certain reset my spawn every 10 feet which was made laborious by having to push two buttons instead of one.I also wonder if this game could benefit from not giving the player a set number of lives, but a set number of times they can reset their spawn.I would stay away from this one for all of the reasons above, plus its under an hour of gameplay from start to finish."

Good music, nice retro graphics, few gamemodes (including some challenging ones for hardcore gamers)... Sounds like a great game. Unfortunately two things hinder the gameplay for me to the point where I'm really not interested in playing anymore.1) jumping control - there's no momentum attached to your jumps. The moment you stop pressing your dpad, character just stops dead in it's tracks. Even Mario for NES had this momentum feature implemented. You know why? Because it worked...2) levels design - you enter new area hoping for some fun platforming action and what you get is impossibly long horizontal corridor with few moving up and down microscopic platforms to jump on and spikes underneath. One mistake and you're dead, you can't set spawn point on the platform, so you have to keep trying, getting pretty bored and angry at this horrendous level design. There are lots of these kind of obstacles in the game.So it's a good game overall, if you have high level of tolerance for assholish platforming."

The interesting part of this game is that you have the option to set a respawn point whenever you want, but at the cost of a lower final score if you constantly set spawns. The game boasts several different modes including the standard mode, in which you must finish the game with 100 lives, and the speedrun mode, where you must finish the game as fast as possible.PROS:- An abundance in variety of obstacles between the levels, no 2 levels feel the same- Difficult at times, yet not unfair- Very fluent controls- Majority of the levels have a smooth soundtrack- Very reasonable price- Features software which allows you to create your own levelsCONS:- Not choc-a-bloc with content- First time players might lose patience with some of the later levels- Can get boring after long sessionsVERDICT:Love pretty much flawlessly does what it set out to do, the solid platforming combined with the chill soundtrack makes for a cheap, fun game which serves a great way to kill 15-30 minutes a day."

Most of the levels are fairly by-the-numbers explorations of a single mechanic, using mostly horizontal platforms. It's a shame, because when it deviates from this formula the game comes into its own. In particular, the level ""Belly of the Beast"" (pictured on one of the trading cards) is fantastic, and shows how rewarding platforming can be when exploring the level is its own reward. If the rest of the game had been up to that standard, I would recommend it unreservedly.Still, it's a fun experience, with responsive controls and a good soundtrack."

For one, I can appreciate any 2D platformer that has the decency to give you a ""save anywhere"" feature. Mario and Metroid, while fun can be very tiring after playing the same part of a level over and over and LOVE totally cuts that out. I love it. Thank you.However, there isn't a whole lot to recommend beyond the save-anywhere feature. You run and jump. You avoid obstacles in well-designed levels. And that's it. Granted, there are changes to gameplay and obstacles but they're so short that you don't get a feeling of actually mastering them, like in Mario or Metroid.That and the fact that the game has 16 levels (well, technically a lot more with the remix mode), despite the changes in speedrun mode and hard mode... there isn't much to LOVE to really find anything special in. Similar to ""You Have to Win the Game"", LOVE does has smooth controls, a nice graphical aesthetic, and a great difficulty and save feature, but it's so samey and safe that it's just not something you'll want to go back and play in a while. Or at least I don't.If you like a fun 2D Platformer, LOVE certainly is that. But beyond the simple mechanics, it's not a particularly memorable experience. I'm giving it a 6/10."

The trailer gives a good idea of what to expect in terms of minimalist pixel art and atmospheric soundtrack.  Each level has its own feel, and several introduce new gameplay elements - like moving platforms on a track, or falling through the ""slow tube"" and dodging spikes.A clever game mechanic is that you can set a respawn point anywhere you stand.  If you use lots of respawn points, you can retry failed jump almost instantly, so the difficulty level is very gentle.  Or, you can try for an A (or A++) score, which means using few or respawns - that takes the difficulty level up closer to Super Meat Boy territory."

It does have to be played in one sitting, but if even I can manage that in under half an hour (and I am not good at computer games) then that should be fine for most players, and it has that engagingly moreish level of frustration which keeps you playing without ever crossing the line into painful.Another strength of the game is the way it introduces concepts and approaches to you, in particular the bouncing platforms, and then increases the difficulty over subsequent levels. It is also well ramped up difficulty-wise, so that while I can get through the first level without dying, the penultimate one will easily eat a quarter of my total lives.For the hardcore there are other modes - both Speedrun and YOLO (which both kind of do what they say on the tin) - as well as scores at the end of the run to attempt to improve, and achievements corresponding to each of these; probably beyond what I personally will aim for due to sheer difficulty, but a good addition for those who want to get more playtime out of this game or just those masochists who like a bit more of a challenge.I can't comment on the music, as I haven't been able to have my volume on for unrelated reasons, but the art style also lends itself to the game with its simplicity and retro aesthetic. That said, I'm not sure I'd advise it for anyone with epilepsy as there is one section which does appear to almost flash at you as you descend, and I'm not sure whether that could cause problems.Overall, great fun, eminently moreish and a perfectly positioned short, affordable platformer."

It is worth a small price for its shortness, but you will enjoy every part of it.  It supports gamepads, has a speedrun mode, and a one life mode.  The standard mode you are graded on gives you 100 lives and grades by how many lives and respawn points you use through the 15 or so levels.The main glitch is when accessing menus too quickly or when returning to a mode after being in another--it is always better to exit the game to switch modes because the glitch will make the graphics awkwardly flicker.

I now have the song in an online playlist of music. I don't have the game anymore.The game is locked at 30 fps and it honestly makes me sick during some sections. VVVVVV did fine since the screen never scrolls and the only thing that moves is the character, but the whole screen moves in LOVE and it looks and feels terrible.Also, the reason I bought the game was mainly to listen to music like the one in the trailer. Turns out the rest of the music is nothing like the one in the trailer. Every time you beat a level, the music abruptly stops and switches to another song instead of fading into the next one.One irksome thing that this game makes you do is set your own checkpoints. In VVVVVV there were checkpoints everywhere. Every time you did a jump or challenge, there was a checkpoint standing there waiting for you to save your progress. In this game, you ""get"" to set it yourself. This could make the game easier in some cases. However, it was mainly a bother to me. At some points I'd make tremendous progress throughout the level. Then I'd die, feel a slow sinking in my stomach as I remember that I hadn't saved my progress at all and am promptly respawned at my last checkpoint way, way back in the level. Leaving the checkpoints to be set by the player and not designing them around the levels seems like lazy development to me.It wouldn't be a huge problem if you could set the checkpointsin addition tothe checkpoints that are already there, but it's a mechanic that just sucks.I had to refund the game because the reasons above made the game incredibly unenjoyable for me. I played it and beat it twice as well as playing all the extra levels in search of the fun I so wanted to have in the game, but I just couldn't enjoy it because the music was bad, the fps was too low, the checkpoint system was a pain. Controlling the character also felt less responsive than VVVVVV, but that could be a combination of the 30 fps and the whole screen moving at the same time.I don't recommend buying this game, but you should definitely check out the song from the trailer.https://youtu.be/_kh42huPe78"

So now that that is out the way, allow me to review this game-Story: There is no story. You are just a guy going through levels. Why? Well... who knows?Gameplay: You are given 4 modes to play in- Easy, Standard YOLO, and Speed Run (keep in mind, there are 12, short levels in this game). In easy mode, you have unlimited lives. In standard mode, you have 100 lives. In YOLO, you have 1 life. In Speed Run mode, you have unlimited lives again, and a timer that times you throughout the entire game, giving you your total time when you finish. There are not many buttons in this game at all. You move left and right (Arrow Keys), jump (A), and set respawn points, where you will respawn when you die (S). On the Xbox 360 controller, you move left and right (analogue stick or D-Pad), jump (A button), set respawn points (X or B Button), and intentionally lose 1 life to respawn at a respawn point (which I don't know how to do on the PC contols) (Y button). As you have probably guessed, respawn points are critical if you are in easy, standard, or speed run mode. If you make 1 respawn point, the previous one you made disappears, and when you die, you will respawn at your most recent respawn point. From what I've played, it seems there was never a point where I respawned in a place where I will always die (I think since most things that hurt you move, this will probably never happen to you). Also, you cannot make a respawn point anywhere other than the ground. Moving away from that topic, once you beat the game, you are given a letter grade (A-F, like in school), depending on how well you did based on your time, and other factors (+ and - are used in thje score too. For example: A++). It's a bummer that you can't change the PC controls (keep in mind, I'm playing this on the day it came out), and to be honest, the PC controls are bit off compared to the controller controls. Seriously, this game was meant to be played on a controller (you can't change the controls for the controller either, but they feel perfect so it's absolutely unnecesary). If you haven't already gotten the memo, this game is simple (including the controls, level design, just... everything), and that is what this game holds as it's charming factor. Also, each level is completely different from the last, but I think there could have been different colors used, as I do remember 2 blue levels, 2 yellow levels (really, what's with the repetition?).Graphics: Don't worry, you won't be needing a GTX Titan for this one. Simply put, if you have a modern, working computer, YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT A PROBLEM. The graphics have a simplistic, retro, kind of look, and I love it. With so many games today that look so realistic, this is a good break. Honestly, I don't play video games to simulate a 'realistic' world I already live in. When I play a video game, I want an escape. I want a game that plays different, feels different, and just looks different. That's what I love about these Atari-esc graphics- it's just art to me. I feel like I'm really transported into another world in this game. You really do have to admire the blank, black bacgrounds, solid color obsacles, square pixel-like objects, a stick character with a funny looking head...Music: Fantastic variety of tracks that are memorable. You have your techno, hip-hop and rap instrumentals, and many others relaxing and engrossing tunes that are just incredible. My favorite track is ""Kid.""Memorable Aspects: I love the simple and amusing menu sequence. Who can froget the animation where the character has his arms behind him as he races forward. The death animations are very creative too.Overall: The game has a charm that makes you remember the ""Love"" you had for older games (with the beautiful music, simple gameplay, and ""different"" graphics). Even though you have the ability to speed run the game, and there is a YOLO mode to keep you interested, the amount of content is minimal (there are only 12 very short levels!). And yes, I'm well aware the game is only $3.00 when not on sale, but c-mon, I would much rather have worthwhile content with HOURS of potential fun, instead of minutes. Really, I don't want to have to wait for ""Love 2"" to get more of this game after only playing for less than an hour. Still, I feel the really short amount of content can leave some questioning the price of $3.00, but when it's on sale, it is definitely worth it. I'm afraid I'll have to give it an 8.5/10 mostly beacause of the EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY small content. If you even remotely like platformers though, this should be in your Seam library right now."

Let me start over.What is love? Well, when two people have certain feelings towards each other, they...what, that isn't the topic either?......oh, the GAME! Right...Love is excellent. Fun, hard and forgiving at the same time. A retro-graphics platformer. (retro being pixels. HARD pixels. The bottom soil of the old era.) A playthrough is shorter than the love-kind-relationship that your dog and your guinea pig used to have, but it sounds better and is more fun, and doesn't destroy your furniture.It has several game modes, one being the easy (e.g. cheap and no one plays it anyway) mode that gives you unlimited lives (yay, games!) but also a smaller score upon completion. Normal gives you 100 lives and you will get the normal (duh) scoring, depending on how many lives you have, how many spawnpoints you have set (YES YOU CAN SET THEM YOURSELF OMGSLJDESFS) and how fast you were - tons of replay potential.For the upcoming sadists, there is a YOLO Mode. Yes, it is called like that. Die once and it is over. Pure madness.And a speedrun mode, which arguably is the most fun mode because you can just get faster and faster and the game is visibly designed around improving your times and erasing mistakes and getting faster. Sonic would be proud, right before the spikes would bury themselves in his soft little fur. Just like your dogs teeth in your guinea pig.But anyway, I am in love with love. It is a lovely loveable game. And you will love it too if you like tough as nails but fair platformers and highscores, and if you like to work on your mistakes.I am out."

,Recommended,269270,9013191,"Posted: 7 February, 2014",all,Mantaloupe,"Love. There is a bit to say about this game. Many may be turned off by its simplistic graphics, but don't let this turn you away.While, yes, it is a simple game with even simpler controls. But, it's fun, and easy, to play, and with its gamemodes and gradescale it's a damn hard one to master.The game itself; if you'd rather just get through it without worrying about losing all your lives or going as fast as you can, is rather forgiving. I mean, whenever you're standing still you can set your respawn point. This is helpful, but there still are areas where you cannot save, and you'll have to make long stretches and rely on your timing and wit to survive them. Sometimes they aren't so bad, and sometimes...yeesh.Also, I like the fact that it's a PvE game. Rather than fighting off hordes of enemies that wish nothing more than to blow up your little, pixelated stick figure, it is instead spikes, pitfalls, projectiles, and a rather...mysterious, volatile white ooze. This helps hone a mindset that won't let you blame bad enemy AI because, well, there are no enemies! Instead, you must very, *very* carefully. One slip or miscalculation, and you will fall to your death--either by spikes or by pitfall.The game will also appeal very greatly to the speedrunning community. With its own mode with a timer, you can try to run through the levels as fast as you can and upload a score. Also, those who like achievements, this game has a decent 19 for you to strive to collect.And the music.Man, don't even get me started on the music. It goes so well with the game, it's just fun to listen to the beat. The songs are incredibly basic, and short, but they go to compensate with the rather short levels, so it's not so bad.My only *major* problem is that the game lacks a pause feature. I often try to leave an accidentally selected gamemode and I accidentally end up quitting the game, which can be a bit annoying. However, seeing how this game is in the ""Early Access"" category, and that it just came out today, I'm certain it will be put in soon.Overall, Love is a great game. It's not a particularly long game, and it's not very hard to beat, but when you try to head for the top or to gather all the achievments, then prepare to be in a world of hurt. I'm talking Mega-Contravania kind of hard, with an Atari 2600-esque look and a kickass soundtrack to boot.So, in my opinion, yes, it's worth the $2-3 you pay for it."

The great music and well thought-out aesthetics have a lot to do with this. The platforming is a mix of undeniably easy and overwhelmingly hard. Each level has it's own perceptual personality with it's own level design philosophy to go along with it. The only problem is each of the levels are too short a lot of the time, which made me wish for more. I also wanted each level to have it's own soundtrack because each one fit so well with the levels you first hear them in. Once you go to later levels the songs end up being repeated which is a detriment to the overall feel of the game and the greatness of the earlier levels.

The concept is fine, but it's very flawed when it comes to it's execution.The look of the game follows this simple aesthetic, and looks a bit like something that would have come out on the Intellivision. However, they don't take the aesthetic far enough so the graphics manage to look more boring and cheaply made instead of retro.The soundtrack is good, and is likely the best part of the game. However, it's not super mindblowing or anything, just well done.The part where this game really breaks apart for me is in the level design and the controls. The levels are all really simply designed, with the paths you take through them being really basic without much of anything interesting going on, sometimes simply having them be an excuse to shove some poorly drawn pixel art in your face. All of the levels essentially feel very uninspired.The controls are really imprecise and don't feel as tight and resonsive as something like a Super Meat Boy or even a VVVVVV. Your jump doesn't really have any weight to it, either. Your character doesn't feel weighty or floaty, there's essentially just no inertia to any of the movement. It just feels like it's moving your character up as you hold the jump button and immediately moving them down as you let go. The controls just feelBADand are probably the worst part of the game.Overall, it's a simple game, and while it's inexpensive, it's also not a great experience.

Mediocre in a lot of ways, LOVE fails to ever exceed expectations, nor does it ever fail to meet them. It's the epitome of generic, and while it is decent, that isn't enough to qualify as a recommendation. LOVE is never great; it's just passable.LOVE unfortunately possesses flaws that so many other 8-bit indie platformers have been hampered by. LOVE doesn't really feel like an entirely complete package either, which is a damn shame, because there's obviously a lot of effort and care that's been put into this product. However, it is basically just your run of the mill 8-bit indie platformer. I wouldn't say you shouldn't purchase this, because that's not my decision. Perhaps you will the find the enjoyment in this title that I didn't.Pros: -Tight controls-Genuinely intense gameplay at times-Good soundtrack-Fair amount of replayability and modes-Cheap and fair price-Level editorCons: -Too short, can be completed in 30 minutes or less-Generic in many ways-Visuals hard to look at after a while-Feels somewhat incomplete-Aesthetic feels somewhat unneeded, doesn’t really add or take away from the gameFull review here:https://theflashcollection.wordpress.com/2016/01/21/love-review-2/"

,Recommended,269270,31549698,Posted: 4 May,all,Deezine,"Brief DescriptionMinimalist platformer with retro graphics reminiscent of the Atari era. The only gimmick is leaving a checkpoint anywhere on the level. Otherwise it's purely dodging traps, riding moving and/or bouncing platforms, and jumping over gaps.What I LikedSublime soundtrack that evokes the retro feel of the game.Tight controls. Jumping and moving are never float-y.Distinct themes for each level, with just enough levels to make the price tag worth it.Gamemodes and difficulty levels for any tier of player, casuals to hardcore. Even includes the infamous ""one life"" mode.What I Didn't LikeIt's short, all things considered. As previously mentioned, though, the pricing is fair.The last level has too much bullet hell going on for my taste, and doesn't fit with the rest of the levelset.What's MissingSteam Workshop support for additional levels.Perfect ForAnyone who appreciates low-res graphics and platformers.Speedrunners.Highlights""YOLO"" game mode."

Even after managing to run through the entire thing, I find myself coming back to LOVE for the pure sake of trying to beat my previous times.I'd suggest buying the game on sale or with a coupon if you ever get either opportunity."

If you are into this genre you'll probably enjoy it."

,Recommended,269270,17146498,"Posted: 20 July, 2015",all,MPO,"A fantastic, surreal, and challenging experience!  The scoring system is very involved, encouraging you to perform well in all areas and weigh your use of checkpoints against how many points you might save by not dying.  Also very optimized for speedrunning, and reminiscent of VVVVVV with its abstract and referential scenery.The music is sublime, and you can get it here:https://loveplus.bandcamp.com/"
