,Recommended,269290,9251750,"Posted: 24 February, 2014",all,weirdphil,"*This review has been edited after the voice-recording issue had been resolved, and adjusted further after spending a couple more weeks using it. Lots of info here. This review may not change your mind about the software, but it's intended to provide you with the information you need to make that decision.This is a great, cheap product, depending on what you need from it. Records audio and video pretty well, and there's a good variety of codecs to choose from, with some additional options for Picture in Picture and limiting your fps if you need to, adding a watermark and such. Little things like that. To compare this to FRAPS, this will provide you with high-quality visuals if you can afford the harddisk space. The default MPEG-4 codec (which it recommends) will eat up approximately 225-250 MB for 2 minutes of footage (varies on how much is going on visually) at 1080p 30fps. You WILL want to experiment with codecs and bitrates to achieve the best performance for what you need out of whatever you're recording. This is something that FRAPS does not do, as FRAPS uses a custom codec that you'll need to obtain again should you decide to reinstall a fresh OS or uninstall FRAPS. I've enjoyed FRAPS a lot, and consider it a beast as it taxes your PC and requires really hefty hardware and lots of RAM, but it's very simple to use. This software requires more fine-tuning than FRAPS. Experiment and find that sweet spot.To compare this to xSplit Broadcaster/Gamecaster (no, this does not allow live streaming) you can make use of the Picture in Picture functions to place a webcam (adjustable size, but you can only place the PnP in one of 9 spaces, left/center/right from top to bottom, think tic tac toe), This is useful for those of you who may be making videos for YouTube (etc...) and you would like to have a webcam for your face and your voice commentary, and even has Chroma settings for those of you who can use them effectively. xSplit does this as well, but allows you to resize, crop, and place the screens anywhere. xSplit Gamecaster has more of an in-game interface as opposed to xSplit Broadcaster, and there are things in Broadcaster that you can't do in Gamecaster (in regards to window/screen/display positions). Speaking of voice commentary, this brings us to an issue that I had earlier with the software.liteCam has some audio settings that really need some work. If you have multiple voice recording devices plugged in, you cannot change the order of priority/order of those devices. This is where things get tricky and where the real meat of the original version of this revised review was.I use a Logitech G35 USB headset for voice recording/capture, and a Logitech 720p webcam with built-in microphone, and I also have the Screaming Bee audio drivers for modifying my voice. My G35 was set as my default voice communication device as far as my OS was concerned and should have taken priority. liteCam was using the Screaming Bee drivers by default when I had placed the check mark (on liteCam's audio settings) to enable my microphone and did not give me a choice in the matter. Because of this, I could record game audio, but not my voice, and adjusting the settings another way allowed me to record my voice, but not the game audio. It was one or the other, but not both, all because it was picking up the wrong drivers. Again, Screaming Bee isn't physical hardware, it's a device driver I can use to modify my voice, and Windows recognizes my G35 headset as the default voice communication device, but liteCam didn't care or give me the option to choose it. This wasn't fixed until I just up and disabled Screaming Bee. The microphone settings work now, but I'm not entirely sure if it's really recording from my headset or my webcam now. A fix or adjustment to this in the future would be nice. Just for clarification, this was all accomplished hours later after thinking about it and writing an angry email to the devs. The product is still new and there was no actual support in the forums here for it other than ""send an email tolitecam@rsupport.comTHX"".Others have complained about stuttering or issues with their FPS. This may be a case by case issue. I've not noticed many problems with my FPS because I'm not running on default settings. My montor doesn't display any higher than 60, so try not to set your settings higher than you can handle. It will give you options to adjust the framerate for your games as well as the recording's framerate. Be sure to adjust both of those values before playing any games.This software also allows you to edit your videos you recorded but your only option is to trim from left or right. You will want to obtain some decent video-editting software. That's a given though. Unless you're just starting out, most of you who would be interested in this software may already have editing software installed. When recording in xSplit, liteCam, or FRAPS, I'll still be running my footage through Vegas or similar programs.Last couple issues: Running the program through Steam will make it difficult to invite to multiplayer games. Exiting liteCam can crash some of your programs. I've had it crash ArmA 3 as well as the Raptr desktop app. A patch came through last night, resolved the crashing issues in one area, but caused another issue elsewhere. Again, your milage may vary, maybe they can fix it, but that's all on them. Finally, there's a woman's voice that says ""Recording Ready""/""On""/""Off"". It's loud, it's annoying, and there's no way to turn it off. You can't even mute liteCam from your volume mixer.FRAPS is about $40, xSplit is $25/month $60/year $110/3-years and liteCam is $25 when it's not on sale. You can't live stream with it, but it may suit your needs. It is the cheapest of those 3 I've compared it to, and I would almost say it's better than fraps.EDIT: Been using this for a few weeks now. I'm not going back to FRAPS anymore. They have resolved many crashing issues that I had experienced before, and they are still pumping out updates and just released a new codec to use. If they continue to update this software on a more or less semi-regular basis until it's perfect, this one is definitely a keeper. Recorded some footage of Grand Theft Auto Online on Xbox 360 using this software in Video Recording mode on my Hauppauge HD PVR2 (1080p @ 30 fps) for 18 minutes. FRAPS used up 37 GB and this used up about 800 MB before running it through Vegas to knock it down further. 24 Minutes of Little Pink Best Buds prototype on liteCam requred 2 GB. FRAPS would have required more than 55 GB."

If you need a screen recording software for games, use FRAPs, or anything else, really. This program is awful. I recorded an hour of raw footage and the recording was corrupted at the end. I tried recording numerous times thereafter and each time the recording was either corrupt or had graphical glitches like greyed out pallets or inverted color schemes. I've never actually wanted my money back for anything that I've bought on Steam, but this makes the first time for that. Please do yourself a favor and do not purchase this program. You will regret it if you do."

I was looking for something to record games that FRAPS wouldn't record and this isn't it. At first it worked okay, but I found on long recording sessions that it dropped the frame rate so low that the recording hung at a still frame for 10-15 seconds, skipped to another still frame and hung on it for 10-15. Rinse and Repeat.  And this was recording a 16bit indie RPG game.After the July updates it is unusable. I launch it, try to start recording, 1 second of recording and it crashes. The only fix mentioned is to go and download a codec, which I did. Didn't fix it. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still doesn't work. I'm fed up with it. This software is garbage at this time. I suggest anyone looking for a recording program to buy FRAPS and for the games that FRAPS can't record, use Bandicam. I should have bought Bandicam in the first place. Silly me for trying to support a little developer."

I had an issue in which I couldn't record game and microphone audio at the same time using the software, which is disappointing since the fact it does picture-in-picture was very alluring, the microphone audio was choppy and small bits would be pulled from earlier parts of the recording producing a choppy effect or a tapping noise. This sound was extremely distracting in the videos and rendered them useless from a professional standpoint. A gentleman was very kind in trying to assist me in getting the software to work, but neither of us could seem to find out what was wrong. If in the future the program is fixed and compatable with my computer (which is a very capable piece of hardware I might add) then I will retract this review and judge it according to it's capabilities then, but for the time being this software should never have been released without being thoroughly tested on multiple platforms.Also, in case that happens, if the software does get a major update and you see this, please let me know so I can review it again at that time. As it stands now, I would definately say that this program is not a good investment at this time.Also, please vote this (and other honest) reviews up, people deserved to be warned about this product."

,Recommended,269290,11485064,"Posted: 30 July, 2014",all,~n00bz~,"This video capture software is straightforward in its basic operation and does as advertised.It will-Record your entire sessionRecord your Mic as well as others chatting via in game com's  or over Steam callsRecord in optimal resolutions that you choose in the menu or not record the voice/com's based on your options and preferences.Over all I am quite satisfied with the performance and overall quality of the videos that come from this software. Some games do record at a better quality than others, but the loss is so marginal that it will not hinder the overall presentation of your video. The sound is recorded in full stereo and without any noticeable volume drops or interference.Now, there are a few small issues that I have come across. When updates come out is is possible that the location of your saved videos will revert back to your main drive (C:\) rather than the one you designated, but a simple fix.At random times for no reason the recording will stop with no input from the user. It just stops... The recording is saved but if you did not notice it stop you will keep going thinking everything is fine and dandy. This usually happens when stating a game or switching a game when the software was running in the background.The on screen menu/status bar seems to disappear while ingame and recording. the recording does NOT pick up the status bar but it helps the user to know if it is recording, paused or stopped. Again if you are recording and the bar disappears IT DOES RECORD and save to the folder selected.I also  had an issue with voice quality when recording (coms/chat) being grainy and distant, but that was an audio option I found and corrected.Over all I am quite pleased with this software and do suggest it for anything you may need it for. Watch your recordings because these files get BIG QUICK and is real easy to get carried away and have a 7 gig 1080p video now sucking up your HDD space!Notes: I would like to see a better option menu/settings. There is a voice that tells you when you record and when you stop. But its either on or off a volume control for said voice would be perfect! I also want to see more optimized support for other games. Eg: Star Wars the Old Republic is grainy and less refined than recording Terraria. Why? Not sure just is.Love it tho and would by again if needed."

Support responses are better and the program runs very well.  Well done and I recommend this to anyone looking to shoot web videos and game footage!""Got this to see if it was less of a lag in game than fraps (which will only preform well at half size recordings) and was pleased to see that this one did not lagg game, as much (still afraid to use for anything fast paced like FPS, which is in the name of the software), but it was most likely because it was only recording the audio and a frozen single frame every 20 minutes of recording. Messed with the settings and got it to record smooth video with a freeze every 1-2 minutes for 5-10 seconds with no pattern or common thread in game to be a cause. So we decided it wasnt too bad for a quick post and found out that the recommended codec is not compatipble with most editing suites like Final Cut Pro so now I get to go through and convert all the files with the software's built in converter...but it does not work either.  The company website offers no true support options and the steam support options are even more vague. Bought at 50% off and now know why it was so cheap. Do not recommend."""

Despite claims to record DirectX 8 games, it doesn't properly hook into the one I tried it with (Star Trek Armada II with the Fleet Ops total conversion mod).Additionally, when attempting to record a narrated playthrough of FTL, the software is randomly malfunctioning 8-10 minutes in, turning the video portion of the recording to a stuttering mess.Audio recording is fine, however, and performance impact seems to be minimal on my main system, but until the random recording malfunctions are fixed I cannot recommend this software.Edit: After some persistence, I found that using the Lagarith lossless codec I was able to record without hitches. I would then convert the video using VLC then upload to YouTube.I still have no idea why the included codec was stalling out, but I was glad to find a workaround."

And when the video files were saved they were all mixed together into one file, (webcam & game footage) there was no way to edit them in another program (ie.Greenscreen Editing software) so that was a downer for me.If I could get a refund I would. But for now I warn everyone to stay away from this product. They havent updated in quite a while from what I see on their page.

I realized too late that the product video on Steam for liteCamHD is a bit misleading, this is *not* a rebundled version of the liteCam HD software as I had hoped, it is a commercial version of their previously-free liteCam Game software (now with more FPS and no watermark).I have been disappointed with several things: it does not have the Audio Recording option seen in the video, the insertion of Title and Credits shown in the video is not the ability to splice in your own clips for either - it is text on a black background set by you which is displayed for a moment or scrolled past as credits - far less robust than I had hoped, the Video Recording menu shows options for FPS above 30 but you cannot select them - I hope they will be in a future update, there was one error message I received so far when the PIP failed but it was entirely in Korean so I have no way to know what the actual problem was, and most of all the video trimming function has not worked well for me - perhaps I'm using it wrong, but any video I have tried to trim has come out black with audio intact. I have reported my issues to the company but no official response has been given yet (well over a week ago).I had wanted to use this for non-Game video or audio capturing, but it's not the software I had hoped for. No refunds allowed here, so I'm just glad I got it on sale. That said, I bet it works great for game capturing, if all you want to do is record the video and work on that video outside of this software.

It does not work on an alarming amount of games, and there's no way to tell which ones will work until you try it.  I guess the word for that would be unreliable.  It works on less than half of the games I have used it on - all Steam games that should all work fine.  They need to fix this.  When it doesn't recognize a game it records the sound over a black screen...that's entertaining for the viewers.If you are only trying to record a very limited amount of games and can find out that this works with those games then go for it, but if you are looking for an all-around recorder for your games then this will seriously disappoint.  If it was free I would say absolutely, but at this price I have to say no.Due to the fact it works phenominally for the games it actually works with, but fails to work with an upsetting quanitity of popular games that people want to see, I give this software a 3/5.  And keep in mind that may be partially biased because it works with the main game I need to capture, but it sadly doesn't work with the Call of Duty games or many of the other exciting games.

Video Recording and Game recording..Video Recording is something i very much welcome in LiteCam..Video Recording is what we use to record activities on the desktop.. which is perfect for making tutorials for educational purposes.. for example if you want to teach other people how to use Powerpoint and Excel..i love the fact that you can zoom in and zoom out while screen-capturing and even move the frame while recording..it is rare to find a screen capturing app with this price tag that does that while recording.. LiteCam is my  favourite alternative to Camtasia Studio which is a superb screen-capturing app but it has a money draining plan..i  love the fact that NOW you can see your face on the screen while screen-capturing using your webcam (it did not have that feature when i first purchased this app)..the other mode is Game Capturing..if you have nVidia graphic cards, you maybe familiar with Shadow Play.. i still feel that Shadow Play is far superior than any game capturing apps.. (with the exception of ReLive if you have AMD graphic cards)..but LiteCam offers some different 'choices'.. it is like choosing btw a hamburger and a chocolate cake, each is different and each is superior in its own way..`Video quality and playback..before i purchased LiteCam 4.9.0.5,i was discouraged by the amount of negative reviews for this software that ranges from ""it does not work, do not purchase"" to ""the Devoloper is not fixing the numerous problems that this software has"".. but seeing that it is the cheapest 'game-capture' on Steam, plus it was on discount.. i said to myself; why the hell not?!i was going to deliver the biggest F bomb in my review.. because i had problems playing-back all my recordings.. i simply could not view-back my recordings without running into problems..i was using a number of free media players (VLC, TigerPlayer.. ..) to play the LiteCam's AVI files, and they often crashed when playing LiteCam's AVI files - especially when you fast forward or go backward.. among other issues like: muted sound, the voice does not match the video, frequent hick-ups and a pile of error-messages..`the solution was to play the LiteCam AVI files on the standard Microsoft Windows Media Player.. problem solved!! ALSO to convert any files to other standard formats MP4, AVI etc..for some reason, the AVI files produced by LiteCam is causing problems with my video editting software and with the free Video Playback.. to go around this problem, i had to convert the original AVI files to any other format MP4 (iPad standard), MKV and even AVI (a different AVI) using a 3rd party file converter..only then, those issues as mentioned by many many people here were solved..however, i realize that many people do not have similar setup as i do..my humble desktop computer is Windows 10 x64 on Intel i-3 2120 3.30GHz 3.30GHz 8GB of RAM and DeForce GTX650 which is not a leading PC setup out there..`probably my biggest problem with LiteCam is the Video-Converter feature..it sucks.. and i had issues converting one file format to another.. there has been a number of times when the video simply turned black and mute after conversion..there are many good Video converters out there.. i use Aimersoft Video Converter (and no they are not paying me to say good things about them) which works well in converting the problematic AVI files produced by LiteCam to friendlier formats..`in conclusion..i can see myself using this app regularly.. but i see it as a screen-capturing app and less as a game-capturing device..it is my favourite screen capturing app after Camtasia Studio 8 with excellent price tag.. however, i do not think it rivals ShadowPlay on nVidia graphic Cards or ReLive on AMD graphic cards..it does record excellent game videos as advertised, but the toxic AVI files and the poor video converter option is troubling, but salvageable.. and i wish i had the option to make the interface larger (it is too small on my 42"" TV)..overall.. i peraonally feel that LiteCam 4.9.0.5 is an important edition to my collection.. that i will regularly come back to it.. from time to time..i give a good 4 over 5 stars..PS.. if you had problems with the app, it would be more helpful to share something about your computer.. to help other people in deciding whether to try it or not.."

After some troubleshooting with the developer I mentioned it to a friend of mine who suggested that it might be a permissions issue. If anyone else is having this problem try finding the litecam game exe in the steamapps/common folder and check ""run as administrator"" in the file properties. That solved it for me.-UPDATE-If your interested in this program and want to try the demo then I would recommend that if your going to buy it after you have installed the demo from the website, buy the full version FROM THE WEBSITE. If your comfortable not trying the demo, then you can buy the steam version.As I noted in my original review below, the website version and the steam version have differences in the dependancy programs they install, and you will likely save yourself a headache if you stick with one or the other, either the demo and the program from the website, or just the program from steam. I realized that is probably what caused all the problems I had when I initially bought this.Also I have to say, my installation issues aside, this program has worked great for me. I found a ton of functions that I didn't even know were there when I bought it a few months back. For example you can display an image in one corner of your recorded video, even make it partially transparent, so if you have a logo or something you want to ""watermark"" your video with that is easily possible. There is a video recording mode as well as the game recording mode that is the default - The difference being the game mode captures a window, where the video mode captures whatever part of the screen you want - Also, in video capture mode you can pause the capture and draw telestrator-style on the video frame that you stopped. This is easily the best most full featured video capture utility I have tried, I'm really amazed at the quality and features it has for the 15 dollars I paid for it.-ORIGINAL REVIEW-I'd recomend this software because, and this is very important, if you install it right it works great. Webcam PIP and the whole nine yards, can't be beat for the 15$. However... They definatly need to clean up the way it installs. It seems to require 3 seperate sub-programs which are located under the RSUPPORT folder in program files (not steamapps). It tries to install these with the main program, but it's finicky. The program dependencies that are installed seem to be newer versions if you get them from the website demo. Strangely, I also installed this on my laptop and had no problems at all, so it must be a system configuration specific problem or something. If anyone is having problems here is what I did that seems to have made it work.Uninstalled liteCam Game through steamUninstalled RMJPEG, RMP4, and RSCCDeleted the RSUPPORT folder in program files, and the LiteCam Game folder in steamapps - commonRan ccleaner, then ran the check in ccleaner for registry errors and let it fix them, repeated until ccleaner showed no registry errorsRestarted my computerInstalled the demo version of LiteCam Game from the website ( to get the updated RSUPPORT programs)Installed the full version of LiteCam Game from steamI also downloaded  the lame encoder dll when prompted after the demo version install. I'm guessing you are supposed to put it in the LiteCam Game Evaluation folder in program files, so i did, and just in case I also copied the lame dll to the steamapps/common/LiteCam Game folder after I installed the full version through steam. I have no idea if that is nessisary, since the steam version of LiteCam Game never asks you to install the lame dll, but at that point I was taking no chances."

Sadly, when I asked them if it could do screen capture, they claimed it could, so I still would steer clear of the company personally.UPDATE Jan 16th 2016:I've used this more and more for game recording, and I have to say even in that domain, this is definitely not worthwhile.  It routinely has issues where it will not record the game's sound properly, or adjust the volume properly no matter how I try to set the volume.

,Recommended,269290,16685275,"Posted: 24 June, 2015",all,TomZeBomb,"The reason why I bought this, and not other recording softwares like Bandicam, is for one, simple reason.What happens when you go ahead and buy a program for a computer? Usually, it sticks to the computer's hard drive. This does have it's problems, though. If you switch between computers often, you will find out that you need 2 versions of the program for each computer, making it cost more. Minecraft has got this down; simply make an account and buy premium, and then the launcher is free. Steam is the same way, too. Although this type of program is only going to be used on 1 computer, what happens if your computer gets a virus, or your 8-year old son thought it would be funny to drop their dad's fragile gaming laptop/desktop off the top of the house. Well, you want to be prepared for those moments, and not be shot out of $XX for the programs on your computer.First of all, LiteCam is only $10 cheaper. It's not alot, but $10 can be put somewhere where you want it more, like more strange killstreaks from TF2. And I've used the Bandicam Trial version and this version, and they are pretty neck-and-neck in quality. It also has some features that people can enjoy, but don't want to spend 100's of dollars on video editing software. Features like logo placement, video cam, and other things. Quality is pretty nice, I recorded about 45 minutes of footage for a YouTube video, and it looked pretty good.Now, for the bad stuff. To start off, the video cam placement you choose doesn't matter at all, it's still going to be fullscreening the camera. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I've tried everything and it won't work. Second, if you want an easy-to-read FPS counter, you are in the wrong place. The FPS number is very small. Didn't really bother me, but may bother some others.Next up, is not really the problem with this program, but with the Steam intergration. When liteCam crashes, which is uncommon depending on the situation, Steam still thinks I have it launched, when I don't. This is a problem when it comes to launch the recorder again, or when you want to sign out. You have to ""wait"" for liteCam to ""close"". It just ends up with me signing out of my computer and signing back in, and it works for me. Next, probably the biggest grip anyone else has, is the screen recording function. I've heard that it isn't good for anything at all. Personally, I haven't tried it yet, since I don't play browser games that much, even less for recording now. Bandicam has it covered there, unless if you want to pay $40 for each computer to use it. Your choice.Lastly, they added in a video converter. This alone would be nice, but it stops there. Converting anything messes up with the audio, and it gives it this stupid distortion. If you need to convert, I have had good luck with Any Video Converter. It's free, and you can do all of the converting offline if you have to. It's also just good for everyday use.All in all, for $30, it is a bit steep for what you are getting from other's viewpoints, but this is a license they are giving you to use this recorder. You can get payed on YouTube using this. And the toys they give you to edit your recording is nice, haven't seen that in Bandicam at all.9/10. More features than seen in Bandicam, but screen recording, bugs with Steam, and other things keep this from being perfect."

When this software crashes, it also corrupts the video file to an irreparable point. This means that you'll either have to replay whatever you're recording to that point again, or just suck it up and deal with lost footage.As someone who records games that can't be replayed, this is a massive issue. The only reason I use this piece of trash is because I spent 30 dollars on it and can't swing a different software at the moment.If they could fix the random crash issue or drop the price significantly (while reimbursing everyone they've effectively ripped off at this point) then it COULD be worth it.As it stands right now, this product is a DNB (Do Not Buy!)"

The only minor setback was it would drop my fps by about 6 from what I had personally capped it at in my games. Keep in mind though I had this computer for around 3 years already and was running some outdated badly bugged hardware... yes I know, shame, yeah, yeah.From my non-gaming laptop |I was able to set the program to record 40fps without much stuttering between frame capture and playback. Though this is with a cheapy $300 laptop I bought for working on a year before.In all this program DOES do what it says it will, as long as you have some computer knowledge and experience with recording software of any kind this should be relatively easy to adjust to whatever settings you think work best for you, as for the high definition recording; yeah it does actually work, and it will record it in 100fps+ if your rig can handle it, I've tested this with some raw uncut recordings by uploading them to youtube directly while youtube has to actually compress everything past the 60fps just so it works on their site properly. Anywho it did upload to a HD video not what some will claim as it being a garbage program, it simply falls under what your own rig can handle processing. Being as computers come in infinite amounts of configs from companies to building your own it varies to what is put into it, for what it can handle. etc... etc...For some people to troubleshoot problems they have |Reading some reviews though about people saying it's garbage because it wont record if you press (x) button in game, is because you have to manually change the buttons on which the record pause and stop buttons are, personally I used a ctrl+alt+z to record because no games I play require these buttons to be pressed at the same time which won't interrupt your game capture.As for sound problems some have had, going into the audio device options and changing the default to(if it already isn't) ""computer sound"" should solve problems about not recording sound, this will also for the most time record group calls through skype and Teamspeak as well, which is handy when playing team games you record, so you don't just look paranoid talking to nobody. For microphone recording since I use an external Mic to record speaking you have to check the little ""microphone input"" box then go into the gear beside said box and change it to your microphones settings, the display of what channels are showing sound, help you to figure out which channel your mic is on if you run multiple sound softwares that run as a default (ex. Realtek, ASIO4ALL, razer comms { not sure if it still runs as a channel it's self anymore, stopped using razer comms a while ago } etc.)"
,Recommended,269290,13115193,"Posted: 27 November, 2014",all,The Surprise,"I read mixed reviews, and I honestly don't understand the negative reviews.The application is crazy light weight on size.When you first launch, and mind you the application must be launched before your steam game of choice, it prompts with a guide on how to access the options, what icons mean, etc.If you want the 100fps feature, you will need to go into settings and simply pick 100fps, as the default is set to 30fps.If you want to use a USB headset, simply select it from the Microphone settings once you enable Microphone audio under the Sounds options. It even shows feedback live as you talk and allows you to even decrease your mic audio level when it records.If you want to add your own logo, as say you want to upload lets play recordings to YouTube -yes, it does that just fine and will even allow transparency so your logo can be noticed but see-through enough to not block out vital visuals of the game recording.I have yet to encounter problems with this software or something that made me feel I was missing out.Best $_ I've spent on software on discount at the time, but definately worth the $30 price tag any other time. Solid program.If you need to crop and convert to MP4, you may be lucky to find a Freeware app for that out there. i did, but I'm not naming it on this review. This projram is a capture/record type, not an all-in-one solution of capture - edit - publish."

Much worse, when Skrim crashes (which it will very infrequently do) the .avi vid your making will be completely corupted and unplayable (it's not even loadable in a player)."

I expect a performance hit but I am consistantly running DOOM at 59 FPS until the software starts recording. Losing 45 FPS is not acceptable even though I am running  at 4K resolution at medium graphics. It works great for desktop applications but at the resolutions we are using today, I would have expected more from this. I am going to test a few different settings, and I will update this review accordingly.I do not stream, but will be looking at buying some hardware in lieu of this in the future. Action! software is similiar, though only lose 39 FPS. Either way, it is unplayable. I am giving this a thumbs up for the desktop usability and easy to understand interface (which is what I bought it for originally. I just don't reccomend it for a high end 4K setup like mine for game recording.If anyone is interesting in different test resolutions and results, reply and I will see to it in the next few weeks.Specs:AMD 8320 3.5 ghzGTX 980 ti w/ 6g of ramGTX 760 ti 2g ram for physix32 g system memorySamsung 65"" UHD as a monitor.(update): I set everything up to 1080p and all default settings in video as well as advanced settings. The AA defaulted to SMAAx8 so I set it to SMAA only and the game runs on my system at 162 FPS. no surprise there. Litecam is set at 100 FPS but the video still caps at 30 or so during the whole test. A hit of 132 FPS?!!!   WTF. It is safe to say that this software is good desktop demo capture but little else."

It starts with a tutorial, says you can drag it from the bottom left corner to increase the area of footage it captures, it didn't show area enlargement.2. Says in the software title ""100 FPS"", but while recording, it says 25-33 FPS. That's 1 quarter to a third of what software title promises.3. It caught sound, that's nice, but NO FOOTAGE, it captures black screen accompanying whatever sound you're playing on your device, whether it comes from the game or side audio you play while the game you play is on............Unless you are one of the fewer folks who have this active and successfully working for you, you should certainly ask for a refund, and hope you are not too late (14 days+ since purchase, or two hours of gameplay).If you did not buy it, don't bother, save your money, and hope the developers fix the problems this product suffers from."
