Ultra linear, so virtually no replayability. I have 2 hours on record, and that's all there is.The puzzles aren't even that puzzly (admittedly, the fire door was cool) and they don't scale in complexity--because the game is too short for that.I bought it on sale, and I'm still disappointed. Try Toki Tori 2+ or Braid instead."

It's not bad, and for younger players this will be awesome.  I think I expected more from the cool concept of stopping time and traveling through time - again probably a product of rushed timelines or lack of imagination.ProsGreat conceptArt was pretty fun to look at and most of the time very well doneLoved the cannon exit door puzzle (needed more like that)ConsCharacter/Story Design very one-dimension (give your characters real names for pete sake! The ending was real lack laster - the disappointing payoff spurred me to write this review.)Bland Puzzles (i think some were entertaining, but none went too far past simple platforming and bring this object back in time.)Controls a bit awkward on PC. (I dont understand why the menu screens pull up so slow)If you're looking for something as clever as Braid, this is not it, but it'll hold your attention for a few hours.Recommend for Kids YES. Recommend for everyone else - eh maybe hold off til this goes on sale."

An expertly crafted platformer, the game boasts a beautiful art style to complement its sharp gameplay. The story is simple, but effective. An unnamed, elderly inventor is determined to find his shady mentor after one of the pair's contraptions causes apocalyptic destruction. Along the way, the inventor encounters a friendly snail with the ability to freeze time. Combined with the old man's penchant for traveling from past to present, the slimy companion introduces a unique gameplay structure.The player alternates between the two characters in order to solve brilliantly designed puzzles oriented around manipulating time in order to alter the landscape and circumvent obstacles. The snail's shell serves as a movable platform that can be used to cross gaps, sawblades can be halted in mid-air, and impassible walls in the past become ruined structures in the present. Switching time periods in the middle of a jump can turn certain doom into a saving ledge or platform. These basic mechanis build and combine in interesting and challenging ways as the levles progress. One particularly creative head scratcher involves multiple time switches, an anvil, and flaming cannonballs, all to simply open a door.The game's visual design is superb. Colorful character models and environments seem to pop off the screen. The bright wimsy of ""before"" transforms into the dark, dilapidated melancholy of ""after."" The contrast underscores the narrative's focus on regret and the consequences of terrible decisions. Puzzle construction also reinforces this relationship. In one of the game's shining moments, a decision made concerning a young child in the past has subtly profound implications in the present.While the time spent in ""Chronology's"" world is welcome, it does not last forever. The entire experience can be completed in around 2.5-3 hours, leaving the player with a distinct-- and regrettably brief--brush with greatness. Osao Games should be commended for this effort, a game that merges artistic integrity and ambition with incredibly enjoyable platforming mechanics. Warning: ""Chronolology"" also contains blatant disregard for the laws of the space-time continuum.Score: 9/10"
,Recommended,269330,10105740,"Posted: 13 May, 2014",all,Bl0rch,"First off, let me say, while I overall recommend this game, the only reason I wouldn't recommend it... it's too short. I finished it in about 2-2.5 hours, and that was with some futzing around trying to solve puzzles. If the length of the game is enough to deter you, then I'd let this one pass. Otherwise, read on...The game is a platforming puzzle game that mimics the artwork and feel of Teslagrad, Vessel, and Limbo, but with the mechanics of something like Braid. You are an old man who wakes up in a strange place and need to figure out where you are. He discovers his lost timepiece and with it, the ability to control time. You use the device to travel between past and future, altering the world in ways that allow you to overcome puzzles and advance to new areas. You can interact with certain objects in the environment, carry them with you between worlds, and use them in the past to influence the future, etc.This is inherently the difficulty in the game: figuring out how to manipulate the past to affect the future, etc.About a third of the way in, you meet a snail companion, who also has an uncanny ability; he can stop time. Together, you must use your powers to help the other succeed.The puzzles are clever and challenging, but nothing that will keep you too stumped. The platforming is ok, and sometimes it's a bit frustrating, but it's nothing that's too unforgiving or would make you want to put it down.The music is pretty good and fits well with the game ambience.If you don't mind a short game that's more pleasing with the visuals and music, then this one is worth a go. I might suggest waiting for the price to come down, but <$10 isn't too bad."

You can rush through it in about 2 hours and i think 10 bucks is a bit much for that.The graphics is really well made, especially throughout the switching worlds. The story is not bad but could have used more than only three characters. Especially with the time travel ideas i think they could have done a lot more. I can only remember one occation where it really felt you had made an impact on a person - and even felt kinda bad for it. I would have loved if they had put in more of that but the story is pretty short and doesn't have any twists or turns.So overall - nice puzzle platformer which could have done more"

The part that you want to get a ticket to ride the elevator is a complete bullcrap. This game is a good example of needing talent to create story driven puzzle games. Nonsensical puzzles are far more frustrating that any bugs you can encounter within any game.

Your goal is to go and fix your mistake by going through the present and the past and solving puzzles to stop him.Even though Chronology is extremely short, I enjoyed it. It felt like a childs story book. The art and music for Chronology is really wonderful and fits with the theme of time. I would assume this game is built towards a younger audience because of it's simple puzzles and puns, which is fine. I'm not sure if it's worth $10, but hopefully the developers will add more..(Even though they havent done anything since launch other than patch a few things to actually make the game beatable)."

The developers included several different mechanics which gave them the ability to vary the puzzles quite a bit. There isn't a lot of re-hashing the same puzzles over and over, but a good amount of diversity, which I quite liked, while still maintaining a sense on continuity. The story was interesting, but certainly not the strongest point of this game. The mechanics were good for the most part, although the jumping seemed a little clunky to me, but certainly not a game breaker. The graphics are charming and well-done. The whole game felt a little short, but it was definitely a good experience. I'd recommend this game if you're into solving puzzles, and some mild platforming. Chronology earns a 4 out of 5 stars on my scale."
76561198071531076,Recommended,269330,13063417,"Posted: 23 November, 2014",all,iseeall,"For its small price (got it for 2 euros or something) this game is well worth buying. It's nothing groundbreaking, even though it offers a unique time-travel based mechanics (more like just two parallel 2D worlds between which you jump to solve puzzles, oh, and you can stop time). It's pretty close to Braid, Limbo, Fez, Swapper and many other indie puzzle platformers where basically every next puzzle is a scripted thing which you just need to figure out.I think it took me an evening to complete it (dunno why it shows I only played it only for 2 hours).. The artwork is good, music too, the puzzles are interesting. As with most puzzle games, after the game is completed, there is nothing to come back to - so well, no replay value, but for the small price it's fine.SPOLIERS AHEADI found 2 bugs and had to restart chapters 2 and 7 cuz I was stuck. Namely, in chapter 2 the plant for some reason wouldn't grow in the future after I planted it - the bug wasn't there the next time I restarted the chapter. In chapter 7 the cannon puzzle got completely broken for me. Namely, every vertical shot would result in a cannon loaded with a fireball, even though the fire wasn't running between the tubes - I guess this happened after I put a few balls on fire and shot them. Also, the water wouldn't extinguish the fire on the door after I shot 2 balls on fire at the door in a row. You can imagine that such bugs are especially nasty when you don't know how to solve the puzzle on the first playthru and still experiment with things to kind of ""brute-force"" solve it - only to find out that the puzzle is bugged. And no save feature - had to redo the whole chapter 7 once again and watch a walkthru - and it worked. Was also stuck with the phone puzzle in chapter 6 until I just watched a walkthru for that piece - didn't guess you can reach the lamp in a jump.Anyway, a good game, 7/10.I hope this will be one of the last games in this row of indie platformers cuz frankly I think people are pretty much bored with all of them by now, much like by 2002 everyone was bored with the RTS genre.PS. Oh btw that puzzle where the kid breaks his leg and walks with a stick in the future - uhm, dunno it felt inappropriate somehow.."

It's a puzzle-platformer where you can go back and forth in time to two periods, one before a disaster and one after. You have a friendly snail companion to help you jump to otherwise unreachable locations.The story is minimal, but decent. Think a slimmed down version of Bastion's story with an extremely rudimentary version of Braid and that's Chronology.Pros:+Decent story+Good music+Interesting mechanicNeutral:~ Okay art~ Voice acting wasn't fantastic~ Snail companion was too cute to give the story any weight. I get the tie in with time and snails (ha ha) but it's just...too cute.Cons:-Extremely short. I spent 2 hours and there were several times when I wasted a good 5-10 minutes wandering around trying to figure out a couple of puzzles because they weren't obvious. I could have done with more over everything: more puzzles, more story, more anything.Overall: 8/10. Nothing fantastic, but different enough to be enjoyable. Don't buy at full price, even though it's cheap to begin with. Worth the $3 I paid for it."

It doesn't fit the game at all.It's fun to control both the old man and the snail.Switching back and forth between the present and the future adds an extra element of thoughtfulness in regards to completing the puzzles.The puzzles are somewhat complex, but not frustratingly so.Cons:The loading screen that occurs between each level takes 2-3 minutes to load. While this doesn't seem that bad, actually sitting through those 2-3 minutes multiple times becomes very tedious. It's not even that graphics-heavy of a game; I can't guess why these sort levels take so long to load.The ending is very anticlimactic. In fact, the last level is the shortest one of all.
