76561198109920011,Recommended,269350,9808589,"Posted: 13 April, 2014",all,Vory,"EDIT: November 19Though the game is early access, it's really worth buying.PROS-Dynamic atmosphere. Especially when you set the game to top notch settings. If you have Oculus Rift, terrifying terrific.-Great ambience. Sometimes the music and the sounds get me instead. Imagine going down a corridor and constantly hearing ""Someone's here. Leave."" whispered to your ears. Get a good pair of headphones!-Very immersive. There's a whole town waiting to be explored. I haven't mentioned the sewer system, have I?-Scary. Yes, scary. About the game's horror-o-meter, besides only a few cheap scares, there are elevators, hallways, and illuminating corners. Plus, as I mentioned the sound effect is enough to bring you a good horrifying experience. There are enemies, too. The cool thing is that there's little time for you to react when seeing enemies, and they usually appear out of nowhere. Test your guts, and your mind.CONS-The game is still in the testing phase. That gives it bugs likeframe drops.Frame drops are significantly reduced as of update #7.-Light effects are not as good. Sometimes, as you go around corners, the lights go out. This is more of a minor annoyance, really.-Enemies are not too smart. Just run like hell away from them and you'll be fine. I really expected something more challenging.-The character moves at a snail pace.-It's pretty difficult to move things around.-Inventory system is still incomplete.-Some market-sold computers might not be able to handle the graphics. I test the game on Intel HD Graphics 4000 and Intel Core i7 2.00GHz processor, which runs smoothly but gets choppy in certain highly-detailed and illuminated areas.Overall: 8.5 out of 10. You'll just have to see for yourself."

You have no idea what you're doing, you follow your instinct. Normally, this would be a bad thing, however the way they give you all the choises of where you can go, it makes you feel free from the story and that you can do whatever you want. When you finally get to a place where you were supposed to get to, you're like......wow, too bad i didn't explore more, OH WAIT i can always just go back and check the things out that i missed! :D. This game requires you to spend time in it, and to explore every single corner of the game. Also, not to mention that this game will give you a heart attack without using the ultimate power of pop ups. The sound in the game is enough to make you want to press escape and instantly just want to click that exit game button as soon as possible. The effects can really just start taking over and you just feel in danger and like you should run 4 ur lyf. There was literaly where i was pushed to a point where i just pressed Alt+F4 because of a scary noise that kept going louder and louder.Some Fun/Funny Times I Had:Alright....soooooo..without giving any spoilers here, i got out of some sewers and i decided HEY LET'S PICK UP A TRASH-CAN AND PUSH IT AGAINST THE MONSTERS FACE THE WHOLE TIME TO DODGE IT :D, without expecting it to work ofcourse, i tried it and it worked, so it kept walking into the trashcan, and i was like AH! D: and held the trashcan up a bit higher, then he was stuck underneath the trashcan and i slammed the trashcan down, and poof, i murdered a monster (and by that i pushed him to glitch completely into the ground). My reaction: O.O ...... wut did i just do....I would give this game a 8/10 for being fun and enforcing exploration, not to mention keeping it's horror gamestyle. I can't give it a 10/10 considering it's still in beta, however the score might go up once the game is fully released. Worth every penny."

Pros:  Great ambience, and suspense.  Cons:  Playability is tedious, I feel corraled and guided in ditections.  Exploration leads to mostly dead ends.  Not enough backstory, or point to the game.  Not enough items or interactions with items.Advice would be to put some form of crosshairs to aid in interactions with items, put more items, more backstory, don't seal areas off leaving only one path.  Having played from the begining several times and having had a good amount of game expereinece, I find the initial challenge frustrating afte the frist elevator ride down so odd and difficult that I suspect their is no sollution other than to die.  The second challenge once you get ouf of the white room again seems the only way to progress is again to die.All in all I'm dissapointed in the game because I think you have something here, but find it mostly tedious and the time I spent playing up to this point,   was time wasted.  Perhaps it's just not my type of game.I think any person who was in a situation like that would find any kind of a weapon for defense, and if I wanted answers out of those locked offices I'd break those windows and get into them.  I'd read the crumpled papers on the floor and in trash, move pictures to find anything behind them, and certainly a light switch lol in an office area.I hope the game improves becuase like I said you've got something there, but it's very time consuming and frustrating."

Needs some polishing up (fixing bugs, adding features, etc.) but that is exactly what you expect from an Early Access game. If you aren't bothered by some bugs (they'll be fixed eventually) I would definitly recommend buying this now, otherwise wait a while as they release patches and polish it up. If you are a fan of immersive horror games you should, for sure, give Montas a try, especially since it is only $10 at the moment. I can't wait for the finished game, it's going to be great!"

Everything from shadows to mysteriously opening doors will have you on edge. You know a game has good atmosphere when ten minutes in a flying manhole cover causes you to scream and flinch, along with whomever is watching over your shoulder. The minor bugs in no way impeded gameplay, might have just eased the tension a bit. Some say don't buy since it isn't finished but I say do so. You won't be disappointed."

No updates in over a year and no signs of improvement.5. Notice in the youtube trailer people are getting scared of nothing because that is what happens in the game.Pros:1.It looks nice besides some glitchy textures and could be scary if someone was still working on it.2.

The last update on their Facebook page was from a couple weeks ago, and it was about a local music show. Their last update about *the game* was 3 months ago. It appeared to be basic character animations that weren't even actually implemented in the game yet. A lot of them sucked.I was somebody who was really excited about this game when it first went into Early Access. I told other people about it and got a friend of mine to play because it seemed like such a cool title, that was different from most of the other horror games out there. But it's been ♥♥♥♥ing abandoned - and they attempt, ever so slightly, to make it look like it's not, by making vague posts with NO real information. Middle of last year, they said that they were making TONS of progress, that everything was going swimmingly - and what did their video update from 3 months ago have to show? Crap character models running and falling down on flat untextured surfaces. Another crap character model sitting down in a way that looks fake as all hell. Oh, and COINS falling. COINS!
