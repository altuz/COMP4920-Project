,Not Recommended,269370,9031107,"Posted: 9 February, 2014",all,Millikin,"Lets start with what I didn't like with the game.1. Controls:-The Map interaction really shows that this was made for a touchdevice to begin with, it's a thing to get used to but annoying when you are new to the game.- Combat is a just watching the game play itself as you will auto attack instantly and consistently as soon as an enemy is comes close. You have your Manual attacks that is an Uppercut or a Slam (downward) attack but they are weak unless you wait long enough for your auto-attack to build up enough rage (skulls on the top) to make them stronger. This is fine for a touchgame when you have a limited amount of ""buttons"" to use to not disturbe you visual of the screen for the gameplay but a huge flaw when you have an actual controller to play with. For me this was a really fun draining aspect of the control.Otherwise the movement is very solid and responsive and you can get a really good flow (wich is needed with combat mechanics mentioned above.Graphics, sound were all good though.Story I can't say much about since I didn't get very far in to the game due to the offputting controls.If I had the choice again then I would rather have picked this up on an IOS device rather than getting it here for PC.All the positive feedbacks in this review area fooled me though.Maybe I will give this another chance later but not right now.Wether or not this will be helpful to you I can't say. Just be sure to know what you are paying for, the controls are a major thing to consider if seeking a fun little game to play. This is just way to casual for my taste to be played on a PC with a controller."
,Recommended,269370,9022455,"Posted: 8 February, 2014",all,Orange Wookie,"Last month Android and iOS users were treated to Reaper – Tale of a Pale Swordsman, a side-scrolling action rpg akin to Rogue Legacy on the PC. Reaper however plays a lot more like a traditional RPG than the aforementioned, forgoing the rouge-like elements of its inspiration.  While it does effectively utilize many rpg elements well, it’s definitely not perfect. However, developers Hexage of Radiant Defense notoriety aren’t kidding themselves and only ask $5 for their PC port. All in all it’s absolutely worth the time and money.The core of the title is the combat, a 2d hackfest of the slowest kind. While you would imagine a title like this to warrant flashy moves and twitch gameplay, it has a very slow deliberate pace which can be attributed to its mobile roots. While your movement speed is upgradable as you level up, the game still sports a pacing better suited for a touchscreen than a battlestation. That being said once you get used to the deliberate pacing the game actually tends to open a little.While we are keeping in mind that this is pretty much a direct port of the mobile title, there were a few gripes we have. First and foremost is the inclusion of an “auto attack”. For a mobile game this feature makes sense, but the fact that it was not made optional for the PC port hurts this title, especially due to the fact that it’s the catalyst of the games combat system.

,Not Recommended,269370,9038155,"Posted: 9 February, 2014",all,RaphaelVehuiah,"This game is a bit of a strange experience for me. I WANT to like it, but it constantly decides to be frustrating in exactly he wrong ways. I've seen reviews that say this game required skill, I found the opposite. Skill took the back seat, and instead luck was the ruler of the day. For those who don't want to read the long version, I'd say this: if I'd paid more than the $5 I got it for, I'd feel ripped off. As it is, this game is very flawed execution of a good idea, which still manages to have short stretches of good fun. The fairly unforgiving nature of the game, what with no real defense options makes it somewhat of a strange sell for casual gamers (which seems to be the target audience), but hey, seems to be working for a lot of people according to other reviews. Can't say that I agree with how many people recommend the game.So it basically seems that Reaper was meant to be a bit like an RPG lite, where you could play a few quests and have a bit of fun, not having to get too bogged down in a really in-depth game. Well, right there I'll say that if you like the kind of complex stories that RPG's are generally known for, this story is gonna feel a bit like ""Plot, what Plot?"" There basically isn't a plot. I will refer to the character as ""The Pale Swordsman"", since he has no consistent name or title so far in the game. This may change later, but honestly, the point is relatively moot as the gameplay is so flawed, but I thought I'd mention the story early, since there's little to say. However, enough fluff, time for some crunch.First problem, the auto attack. It does not trigger nearly as much as it should. It feels like the Pale Swordsman is using a prison shank, because you have to get so close you could just about whisper in their ear. Which is strange, seeing as you're effectly using a buster sword, and I'm clearly within range, as I can trigger the uppercut or the slam, and it'll hit, but because of how the rage skulls work, this is not the way you should be playing, as these skills are significantly weaker with no skulls, so you have to rely on the auto hitting, which is less than reliable. This is probably to do with the game being a port from mobiles, but honestly, if you're gonna release a PC version, you should at least make use of the fact they have buttons.Second problem, the controls generally. In short, the controls feel strange and imprecise. To elaborate, the game feels like the character is trapped in a world where the air has the consistency of treacle. Everything is very slowed down. More annoying still, I can't seem to stop bouncing off stuff... which wouldn't really be a problem, except that about 70% of things you're able to bounce off do damage. And it is not often that it's apparent this will happen.The thorns on those vines are EXTREMELY subtle. Tangentially, things in the background, like braziers and cauldrons of hot coal should not hurt you in the way they do, especially when they don't hurt ANYTHING besides you.Though back to the controls point, it's often difficult to even tell when you're going to bounce. Why do I bounce off the normal ground when I'm using the whirling blade jump attack? Even sillier, why do I *sometimes* bounce off the Ground, and even the AIR? If it happened reliably one way or the other, it would be fine, but you can't rely on it. This will be a point later.Also, the Charge attack triggers WAY too easily. Which again, wouldn't necessarily be so bad, since it's the only way to get anywhere in a hurry... but with pits that do 50 damage (in a game where your base health is 100), you end up triggering the charge, when you don't want to. Which at best wastes a Rage Skull, and at worst makes you go down a pit and lose roughly half your HP.Third and Last major gameplay problem: the Enemies. Basically all of them. You get ridiculous situations where you try (or as previously stated, don't try) to use your charge attack and charge into the back of a charging boar... only for you to be damaged by the♥♥♥♥♥♥of a retreating boar... Are they wombats? Do they have an armour-plated rear? But then you have the nigh-bullet hell amount of projectiles that are sent around the battlefield... and wouldn't you know it, you have no dodge roll, dash or any kind of reliable defense aside from the jump, which feels you're on the moon... and with the bouncing problem mentioned earlier...This got to be ridiculous when I was faced by a helicopter, which shoots seeker missiles... and I had to have an aerial duel with it over a strip of wooden palisade... The unreliability of the Air bouncing I said about? Yeah, anytime I didn't bounce of the air or the helicopter, I ended up falling onto the palisade and taking damage from the palisade, unless I used the charge in midair to save myself. Which of course wasted a Rage Skull, because I can't choose to only use the charge as an evasive dash. Instead, I basically have to use the weak version of the Buzzsaw jump attack to slowly whittle away health. Except when I glitch and cling to the helicopter like Spiderman... then I unleash auto-attack blades of fury, before dying because I can't tell I'm being hit (as it's just shotgunning me with it's smaller weapons).So to sum up, nice idea, very flawed execution, tests for storyline came back negative, controls feel strange, when I die I feel cheated. The game doesn't do much to endear itself to me, so even when I try to like it, it just saps my enthusiasm."

I'm not going to blindly rag on this game, the developers definitely did some things right and for $5 none of us should be expecting the next Shadows of the Colossus in regard to quality and originality. However, the fact that:1. I am unable to block in a hack-and-slash RPG where I don't have range attacks2. There is a too clear recycling of the same enemies for far too long, with very little different between enemy types anyway3. Stale and repetitive dialogue/quests4. Repetitive/unimaginative upgrade system and weak gear/items5. No real immersion or reason that pushes you keep wanting to playThese things really are things that kill enjoyment of the game and seriously affect the gameplay and experience.For its price I got a couple of solid hours of entertainment out of it before yawning and discarding it into the pile of games that simply weren't good enough to bother finishing, and I guess perhaps that isn't too bad considering its a low priced indie title. Either way, I expected more and was simply so very underwhelmed and disappointed."

,Not Recommended,269370,31307298,Posted: 22 April,all,insanitysprelude,"Okay, so...This game was alright. For what it is - a hack and slash with little in the way of strategy or tactics - it's fairly decent. You play as Reaper, the 'Dark One', acting as a sellsword between the colonizing Imperials and the native Wilderlings. You basically play all sides against each other for coin, and the only meaningful contribution you can make is how much money you receive at the end of the mission.The story is mildly interesting but too broken up. The tribes are not each fleshed out enough, and the Imperials really just seem like colossal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s no matter what they do. There's a very downer plot twist near the end that just makes no sense at all, and the ending itself is unsatisfying. The controls are clunky and unintuitive, and it's just... ugh.All in all, for what it is - a port of a mobile game to PC - it's decent, I guess. But if you want to buy it, wait for it to go on sale for like 70% off or something before you do. Don't buy it at full price and waste your money."

The hand-drawn art is amazing and the soundtrack is even better. The atmosphere of the game is just so cool.The gameplay is also very entertaining.One of the things I really dislike about modern side-scrollers is that they're all way too easy - but this isn't at all the case for Reaper. This game has the perfect amount of challenge to it - not so easy that you get bored right away, and not too hard that you hate yourself after dying about a hundred times. The controls are very unique and very easy to get used to.I cannot stress how great this game is!Everything this game promises, it delivers.And it's the perfect prce at $5!I give this excellent game a 9/10Must buy"

As i can't simply give this a yes or no is it worth playing. I guess if you looking for a cheap game to while away the hours of your life...then yes it is worth it. But if you like a bit of substance to you time waster games then i say your in the wrong ball park all together find sir...or madam.It is a pretty looking game, its art style is very nice and is what drew me to this game in the first place but when we get to the game aspect...well its a little sloppy. If you are using a control pad the two screens that show you whats what is jumbled and makes it a little hard to figure out what to press to do what. As well as the quick tutorial bit seems pointless. At first i though this was going to be a button masher but the joy of button mashing was taken away from me as you simply walk into enemies to kill them.Sure you can jump around like a monkey on crack to get out of the way of the many spamming attacks of the enemy. Or you can spam you very own spinning sword of death move to victory. As i have found be the case of the game.As for story? well what story. You are a pale swords man who wakes up in a cave (presumably a grim reaper) and the first few dialogues happens and i lost interest. The story does nothing to keep you with it and is dull. The few times i stopped to try and see where this was going. All i saw was the pale swordsman just sounding like he was shouting at everyone, since all his lines are in caps. An no matter what you say, you just sound like an uncaring♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Though this could be some witty portrayal that death is cold and uncaring and doesn't chose sides.

After I first played it, however, I found the combat strange and stopped after 22 minutes. I felt shame in this fact and never came back to it out of guilt. Two years later, i have returned to it, and I've arrived at a new conclusion.This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.The combat isn't strange so much as it is broken. First of all the designated key bindings are atrocious for the game, as up should be jump if it's anything at all, but also the actual system they have is pointless. Sure, skull attacks are worth more, but mashing the up button is faster and leads to greater success. Also, the fetch quests, the weird character dialogue, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of enemies in every encounter make this game a chore. It isn't fun, it isn't innovative, it isn't an indie darling, it's a chore.Reaper is plain and simply the residue of a game that could've been somewhat enjoyable. I felt bad about not giving this game a fair shot, here's the fair shot I'm giving it. This game blows. I will not, and can not, ever recommend it to anyone or anything for as long as I live.

You can use the commands anyways, but they will do significantly less damage. I got bored very quickly with it, hence my only 0.2 hours in it. In all honesty, my opinion doesn't reflect game as a whole. It just didnt live up to what I personally wanted it to be."

All missions are simple ""travel to here and fight some guys"" with little overarching reason (you sometimes perform missions for a tribe you will attack on the very next mission). The combat arenas are all completely  flat, except for occassional pit traps and low walls you need to jump over. All doodads such as fences and barrels on the combat field make your character bounce upward, meaning you spend most combat in the air. The feel is extremely floaty.

After beating the main game it becomes pretty boring to play, though after playing a few hours on Dark Harvest I have found another reason to keep playing. I was very upset at the auto-lock on attacking system at first, but once I got use to it I found it very new and refreshing.

,Recommended,269370,9128743,"Posted: 15 February, 2014",all,mycale,"I was actually surprised of how much time I sunk into Reaper as of yet. It is best played with a Gamepad.The combat system is an interesting mix of player input and auto-attack. When you get close to an enemy, your character starts autoattacking which builds rage. You can use rage for powered up player controlled attacks:DashGround SlamUppercutSpin-Attack (in the air)You can use these whenever, though they are much more powerful if used when you have rage. The combat is surprisingly engaging and varied despite only 5 moves. Between evading projectiles, building up rage and judging which attack to use best against your enemies, you have to take care to evade the traps in the combat arenas. And some encounters are quite challenging.To give you context for your battles, you will travel on an overworld map, dotted with locations to get quests and shops to buy gear.Quests give you gold and XP; each level you get to choose from 3 ability cards, which vary from level to level; some improve your attacks, others add new passive abilities, increase health and so on. There is enough difference in those power up cards, to keep you looking forward to the next level up.Gear-wise, you're able to buy swords, helmets, boots, several accessories, belts and gloves. Hope I got everthing. Though I go for raw damage and armor, there seems to be gear specialisation towards criticals, blocking, speed or whichever stats you want to specialise in.Those light RPG touches are well implemented and make the game engaging enough to keep playing.I was surprised to find the story so far mildly engaging and well written. Though all quests (as of yet) send you off to kill whatever, the story frame of the many, many tasks is written interestingly enough (warring local tribes, helping the imperial bank scam the tribals and so on), though they nearly always end in battle.You are given a good guy, bad guy answer choice, which does not seem to have an impact on the overall story. Though you can preassure your quest-givers into more money or killing them which may or may not yield rewards. It's a nice touch overall, but, as mentioned, the influence of the dialogue choice is limited.So overall, I think the package is more than worth buying: Nice art-style, engaging enough combat, polished and entertainingly written."
