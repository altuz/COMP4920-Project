I wishlist it and go about my day on TF2. I come across someone selling it for 4 keys because they decided against it after buying it. I thought it was a steal, so I got it. I hopped off so I could download it. A short time later, I boot it up, configure it, and play with it. I had so much fun with it. Even programmed in a Dalek voice. The voice and effects packs came out, I got them to continue the fun. So much so, I just kept it as my default mic so I wouldn't have to fiddle with configurations when I wanted to change my voice. But that's when everything changed.Soon, they released some other DLC that was far too expensive for what it was. I thought that since it didn't add any new features that I would use, I wouldn't get it. Around that time, I started using Mumble. I kept getting ""Your mic is cutting off at the end."" Since it never did that before, I chalked it up to Mumble. I'd restart Mumble, and it'd be fine. Thought nothing of it. One day, while playing TF2 I hear the dreadded ""Your mic is cutting out."" Now, I was angry. This never use to happen. What had changed? I can tell you what. I had made MorphVox my default mic. It was creating a delay. So when I'd let go of my PTT button, my full sentence wouldn't get through. So I come to Steam to see if anyone else has this issue and if they figured out how to fix it. Click the forums button... No forums. Click the group button... no group. I go to their site. I had to dig for a good 10 minutes before I got an email address. I send an email. Once I got an email back, they suggested I check a few things in the settings. I set them like they suggest. At first, it seems all good. I get in a few days of TF2 before I'm told I'm cutting out again.I rage quit right there. Tried another mic, still cutting. Different VOIP software. Cutting.  They obviously had given up much hope for this program before they thought they could milk a few more dollars out with Steam. This program is an abandoned piece of garbage that doesn't work like it was promised. DO NOT BUY THIS! It will only make you want to pull your hair out.EDIT: I have started using it for short bursts, no longer sessions. I'm going to see if it works fine with a much much better mic.EDIT 2: After some usage in short bursts, it still delays eventually. It feels like there has been no progress made to fixing this issue."

When using it I thought it wouldn't work for Friday the 13th game, but it did.First of all, you've got to have the voice changer software running in the background. Make sure in the software itself you chose the correct mic you want to use specifically, and that's the one that picks up your voice clearly.Second, your mic in the audio setting on your computer need to be set to the (screaming bee mic) to default. Once that's done, you just open any game that has a voice chat game and have your voice change in game.Recommendations are if you have a computer/ laptop that have extra set of keys on the keyboard, hotkey the voices you want to use. You can change it very quickly by doing that."

But even before getting to the faults of it's poor work with other software, I went th rough tutorials before, and after mind you, and I found it very limited in being functional otherwise. This software seems to go on drastic sale for a reason while at other times it poses it's self as a reliable piece of software when really you're probably not going to get much out of it.Try something like Audacity first, because this current software here, which feels out of date the moment you try it, is just not going to fit the bill for any kind of ease of use, nor functionality of use when you get it going. For one no matter what you do with volume adjusting, it's always quieter than it should be, and then it works on chopping up anything you use it for with other software like SKYPE.Again I give the disclosure that this was not with a whole lot of time, but it wasn't just after it didn't work the first time either. It's not completely un functional, but close to it, and I don't see myself using it regularly.It feels like it was thrown together quickly in someone's garrage and then quickly monitized on a by the numbers selling website.In short, it's functionality falls dramatically short, at least in my experience thus far."

76561198305776520,Recommended,269470,32075352,Posted: 30 May,all,JennyRB,"It dose work and i can finnally use a fake voice instead of using my real voice (it really creaps me out knowing some stranger out there knowing my real voice, becuse i rather keep my real life seperate at all times form any and all online activities).This also works with other programs seperate from steam like second life, youtube streamming, and so forth.The cons that i have ran into is that some people find the audio shakey but i figured it out why. The reason why is that they are to far apart in diffrent reagions of the world. For example I ran into someone online that lives in China (outside of the USA where I live) that there mic was so choppy that i could not understand them at all, but when i came across some one in the northern east part of the United States (lets say one is in Michigain and the other is in New York) i can hear them crystail clear as well as vica versa.As for self adio it depends on what mic you are using and not the program that makes it shakey (recantly i riged my tablet to a mic into my PC and it was shakey, but i just bought a mic headset and the shakey audio disappered though it was very well pricey and took some time to buy it)(i bought this program when it was on sale)"
