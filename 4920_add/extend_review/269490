Most tower defense games are mixtures of previous tower defense games we have all played before.In this game however you are moving around the ""towers"" (that are actually people) in a group while dodging projectiles. It makes for good fun and most importantly it's priced right. I support devs that price their games accordingly. Bardbarian trys something new and for that I give this game a reccomendation.http://youtu.be/JFRQjoFO7Hc"

At first I thought this would be an easy game but obviously as levels progress hordes of mobes get tougher but as you kill you collect gold which you may use to upgrade your hero, your minions and few other things.  You unlock new units the further you survive.  This is a great Tower defense/RTS game, dont think i played another like it but soon as I saw trailer I bought it.This is a well done game thats pretty challenging.  I'll be playing this for a while."

It has quite an original concept, being a tower defense with more than a twist. There is a central point to defend, and there are enemies coming in to attack, ever more, ever more strong. So far, so good.But. The towers to defend your stronghold are not static, but are attached as party-members to the Bard you can steer around the battlefield, destroying enemies ""on the fly"" as it were. You do not attack yourself, but one can enhance the attacks of your party-members by playing short guitar-riffs, played free by collecting notes. Extra attack, speed, defence and a short freeze of the enemies come in handy as the waves of enemies get stronger. As usual, units and your Bard himself can be upgraded, for this one needs the coins the enemies drop in abundance.In order to succeed, fast reactions and speedy thinking are necesarry. I found it difficult at first to keep an overview of the battlefield, as several issues need attention: where are the enemies coming in at thier strongest, which buffs are needed, did any of my units die so I have to summon a new one, is my stronghold still going strong, .... But after a while I got used to it and enjoyed running all over the place, with my little but brave party. Playing it with an Xbox 360-controller certainly helps and feels most natural.Enemies get quite strong before halfway in the game, and so sustaining the 20 waves is no easy task. Every 5 levels there is a boss, but for the most part enemies do not change that much during the game. Still, with an extra ""free run"" mode (try to get as far as you can dodging the enemies) and with a ""survival mode"", one can come back to this game again and again. As can be expected nowadays, there are Steam trading cards and some inviting achievements, which really help to appreciate the game to the full. No classic, but still very enjoyable. Don't hesitate to buy this, especially when it's on sale or in a bundle.Gameplay: 20/30Graphics: 12/20Sound: 9/10 (the combination of the sound-track and the guitar riffs works admirably well)Longelivety: 14/20 (thanks to the extra modes, and to an extra difficulty level)Technical & stability: 9/10Personal rating: 7/10Overall: 71/100"
,Not Recommended,269490,24208526,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,Gunderson Mallard,"Supposedly the protagonist Brad got tired of the grind for XP and decided to retire to be a bard, but this game is still nothing but grind.Brad doesn’t directly attack enemies, but instead plays music to summon members of his party that are selected before the game starts. Half of the game is spending coins to upgrade all kinds of passives for the town, units and Brad himself, but the single upgrade paths are all standard. The player gets some sense of strategy by picking which units to include in their party, which is kind of like selecting what towers to build in a TD game, except being mobile takes away figuring out the puzzle of a good maze or what tower combinations are most efficient for an area. The other part of the game is spent as Brad running around while his party auto attacks enemies. After a while the game kind of feels like it plays itself for the most part.  It never seemed like I got better at fighting the same handful of enemies over and over again while listening to the same melody, in the same environment.I bought in for the promise of more content, mainly co-op, and for the crossover characters. The crossover novelty was cool, but wore off, and the promised content has yet to come. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more with co-op, but overall it was a lukewarm experience.Bardbarian is functional and can be fun for a while, but it’s not really that engaging."

76561197995865992,Not Recommended,269490,11557258,"Posted: 4 August, 2014",all,TasteFlavored,"Don't bother. This game isn't awful but you can find better similar games for free on Kongregate.Your a bardbarian and you summon different units to fight waves of enemy and protect the crystal. You can use powerups and a stun attack to affect the battle but most the time your dodging projectiles and trying to get within the proper range of an enemy. You can upgrade the main character, the units and the town.There just isn't much to this game. The campaign is actually pretty short but it pads itself out by making you grind gold for upgrades, which could be fun but the gameplay gets stale pretty quick so it just becomes a chore. The unlockable units are frustrating because you're not going to want to replace one of the units you have already upgraded - so you probably wont be changing your roster until later levels.  You have to pick 3 units you can summon for each run through, so a lot of the others will fall by the wayside. Your minions will miss constantly, especially long range ones.  The units give you a pretty wide hit area with how they stand around you (without upgrading), so a lot of dodging will involve turning another direction so your units mash together to get to the other side of you. So everything is pretty inprecise and skill doesn't come into play much, it's just comes down to grinding for those upgrades. The controller support is flawed, often you wont be able to preform the stun move and you have to restart the game for it to work again (at least on 360 controllers). Also, the soundtrack and sound effects are annoying and repetitive. I could see how this would be a better IOS game if you just wanted to mindlessly kill a few minutes but I wouldn't suggest buying it on Steam.  On the plus side it does have nice art and the Steam exclusive characters are pretty cool."

It is addictive and you can just read any other reviews and the majority agree with me. This is a very fun Game and i am loving it so far and It seems short but its longer then some games ive played.

,Not Recommended,269490,12590383,"Posted: 20 October, 2014",all,lovinglife139,"Bardbarian is a casual action game with hints of tower defense. I wasn't a huge fan of the game's cartoonish look, but tower defense is my favorite casual genre of game, and I go out of my way to try any game of the genre, whether it claims to add something new or not.Bardbarian is fun in doses, but it quickly wears out its welcome. It adds something new to the tower defense genre, which is the fact that your ""towers"" are various characters that you can upgrade and you can influence their actions using music. You also have no stationary units (other than a full upgrade later on in the game where you can have units defend from on top of two buildings), and you are in charge of moving to the enemies and killing them off before they get close to your town center. While this is a new take on the genre, I didn't find that it added much enjoyment gameplay-wise, and in many cases, it turned out to be frustrating. You essentially have three entrances where enemies spawn, and the screen isn't large enough to cover the entire ""field"", so it's easy to be focusing on defeating enemies on one side of the screen and completely miss enemies coming through on the other side, because they are not visible on screen but only on the mini-map.One of my favorite things about the tower defense genre is conquering maps and moving onto new challenging maps, and figuring out the best strategies for handling the routes enemies would take. Unfortunately, Bardbarian has one map, and one map only. It's understandable, in a way, because your towers are not stationary, so therefore new maps wouldn't be necessary. However, the game quickly becomes dull and repetitive because your surroundings are never changing. To add insult to injury, this game is one of the biggest grindfests I've ever played. Reading other reviews that state it was developed for phones now that I've played the game makes total sense, because this game sure does play like a phone game. Expect to play the same levels and waves of enemies over and over and over and over in order to save enough gold to buy even some of the most basic upgrades. Also, there are 20 waves of enemies, total, in the game. 20 waves TOTAL, which is equal to about one or two maps in most other tower defense games. The game only saves your level progress at every five levels, so if you don't beat the boss at the ends of levels 5, 10, 15, and 20, don't expect to start back on the level you died on. You have to go all the way back to the beginning of that ""section"" to try again.Another issue I find with the game is the fact that your units are so easily killed, even when fully upgraded. Playing through a grindfest of a game to save enough for certain upgrades can be somewhat justified if those upgrades make the player feel as if it was worth it, but upgrading anything--anything, from the Barbarian's own health to his units or the town itself--feels ultimately underwhelming.The game also sports a survival mode (with one map to choose from) and an escape mode (one map). Both are ways to post high scores, add small value to the game, and potentially make a little extra gold. Survival mode is fun for a few tries, but escape wasn't really my cup of tea.In summary, I began this review with the intention on giving the game a ""recommended, but only on sale for $2.00 or less,"" but the more I thought about the game to write this, the more I realized I couldn't justify recommending it. In the end, it's up to you to decide, but I implore those fellow tower defense fans out there to find a different game of the genre to try. Bardbarian removes more enjoyment from the genre than it adds, and to be completely honest, it's possible that tagging this game as tower defense does it an injustice, because I went into this game wanting something that I ultimately did not get. Bardbarian can be fun, but it plays like an action casual phone or online Flash game. If you are willing to pay to purchase it with that in mind, you probably won't be disappointed. Otherwise, I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this.Edit 4/29/2016: I've noticed that an abnormal percentage of people have marked this review as unhelpful. As I always try my best to cover all aspects of a game in a review to be helpful to potential consumers, I would appreciate any comments on my review letting me know the information I've left out, or any questions you have about the game which my review left unanswered. I will update the review as applicable. Thank you!"

Treefortress really hit this one out of the park.  I picked this game up thinking it might be interesting and 5 hours later it was 2 am and I frantically went back and forthfrom the different game modes trying to earn more gold and discover the hidden minions.Bardbarian is like a RTS/TD game where you are brad and by using your awesome axe-lute you can summon different minions to destroy waves of enemies attacking your village.  You are also able to buff yourminions with power rifts using notes that you passively generate.  There are three modes story, escape and survival.  All of which you earn gold to level up all of your minions abilities and even someof the village, like the town drunk( he vomits everywhere to slow the enemies down :)).  As you progress through the story mode you are able to unlock more minions which gives you vast flexibility on your playstyleand strategy as that you can only have 3 minions to choose from any given attempt.the game has two difficulty settings normal and insane.  Insane is... well pretty much insane.  The story mode is split into three parts morning, noon and night I still haven't been able to get through noonon normal so there is a lot of game here for the $.

Concise introduction and tutorial to the game. The suggestion to play with a controller in the beginning was spot on. Very smooth controls. In fact, the game mechanics are tight and extremely enjoyable. This isn't a ""tower defense"" game. It's actually a very refreshing take on that dynamic that I would argue sets it apart from tower defense. You're constantly running around, avoiding projectiles, while navigating your units in positions that will inflict the most damage. Gold collecting to boost the cards you have, along with collecting more cards adds a lot of replay value to the game as well. I'm already interested in trying all the different game modes to see what cards I can find. Not mention, indie game references to boot (Meat Sack card? Yeah, I want that).A+ Best $2 I spent on Steam this year.UPDATE: I ended up 100% this game, buying it for iOS, 100%ing it on that, and buying three copies for friends.

Instead of having the enemies on a set path, they just all come in where ever, and you have to drag the 'towers' behind you. Also, there's a bit of a bonus for fans of a few other games in there, in the form of special heroes/towers you can unlock in the various modes.Music's a bit repetitive, though."

There is no Volume bar.You can play this game with a xbox controller.About the game.You are playing with a barbarian that is only able to move around. He can't attack enemies by hisself but he is able to call his friends or units. You are walking around and the units are following you, You can pick up enemy gold if they has been killed and you need to dodge their attacks to avoid damage. Most of the units are surrounding around you but you and them can still take damage. If one of your units has been destroyed, they will drop some of the musical notes. Musical notes are needed to call units. You will get musical notes overtime or sometimes from enemy drops. You can spend gold to upgrade your hero, Units or even town supplies. You are somewhat dependant on your units, because the only thing that you are able to do is walking around. Your units will upgrade themself during waves but these are only temporary. There is a small map on the top, where you can see enemy movement. There are 2 other game modes. Called survival and escape. If playing Escape, you will have 1 health and you run as much as you can on the right side of the screen. Avoiding enemy bullets and grabbing gold on your way.There is a ingame tutorial.Upgrade Shop (Units/Hero/Town).Has small map on the top.Has 2 different game modes. (Survival mode and escape)Units upgrade themself during waves.You can Pause during waves.Game progression feels slow. (upgrading and clearing waves).VERY Dependant on ur units and your units are a bit MEH in term of play.Super Grinding.Game Goes too slow and makes it Semi-BoringOther things.Some Easter eggs. Like Characters from different games.Playing Challenges could spoil some locked units or enemies, as you can use and see them.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10"

I was juggling the toughest enemies in the game with push-backs and stun before it was even close to over. Waves 1-18 are child's play, and then 19 and 20 will kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you don't have a balanced party of stuns, slows, and push-backs at your desposal.

You'll do less gold-grinding that way, and the game is actually better balanced. You also won't have to play the game twice to get all the achievements. (I got all but one)-Don't forget to SCROLL DOWN in the unlockables and permenant upgrades screens.

The cocktail is surprisingly good.You can get notes (resource) by killing some foes, a certain unlockable structure and by standing still (generally ill-advised). With this you can then hire your henchmen, stronger ones unlocked as you proceed through the day (read: levels) and of course the more powerful the more costly. Upon dying you can use the second resource (gold) to permanently upgrade yourself or your henchmen.It also comes with 2 minigames (to help gather some gold, both also unlock a henchman), one a running (just prevent getting hit) which is the least fun one IMO and a 'survival' mode where you randomly get henchmen to you with increasingly difficult enemies, which is a little more fun. But the best fun is of course gotten from the main game."

While it's not even pretending to be original, this mix is nice from every angle (if you'll not be looking for too long).You'll be playing for the partygoer who can't fight monsters himself, but good at avoiding hits and making friends. And with help of those friends you'll be defending your village from the onslaught of gremlins, lizards, beholders... and so on. The main catch of this game is that those Bard's friends acts very differently, so you can develop various tactics of the best team around you. Some of those helpers will be taking damage, some - dealing it to the enemies, but it's only for start! An engineer, per example, will be setting shooting towers, so for some time you can play it as basic tower defence game - two engineers in your team can overrun almost everything in the first half of the game! Glory to the engineers!And glory to the rock music!But seriously, it's a short break game. It can create some fun, but it's a very simplified game experience. I cannot praise that game highly, despite the fact it is a well made stuff. I'll mark it as 7/10.You surely can buy Bardbarian in some bundle, or with good discount, and spend 3-4 hours of your time.

The gameplay feels interesting, at first, but lacks more than a few hours of gameplay.  I beat the game on Insane difficulty in about 3 hours.  I have basically everything unlocked and maxed except for a few units (which would require grinding for another hour or so).  Even on Insane difficulty, I found myself standing at the front gate killing enemies before they could even get a single shot off.  Eventually you'd hit a wave / boss that's a brick wall and would require you to die and upgrade (sometimes a few times) before you could pass it.  If the developer could smooth out this progression, it would feel much more exciting to play.Besides all of the cons I've listed above, the game is some sort of Flash port.  I have a gaming PC, and I get about 3 frames per second on the main title in windowed mode.  In fullscreen mode, the main screen doesn't even load and the game crashes.  I spent the first few hours after purchasing this game trying to solve this problem.  The game is littered with other bugs as well.I would avoid this game, personally, but if you like grindy games, I suppose I could recommend it at $1 or in a bundle somewhere.2/5 Stars"

I've never played it on android phone before, so this review is strictly from the perspective of a PC game.   I tried playing both via keyboard and a xbox 360 controller, and I recommend playing this with the controller.At a glance, the main game is deceptively simple.  Your tower is on the left side of the map, and creatures approach from the right side of the map.  The hordes of monsters will continuously come at you (first) and the tower (second).  Your Brad the Bardbarian can't do any attacks on his own.  He needs to drum up some tunes on his axe-lute to call up the cavalry--troops who follow your character and fire at the mobs.  You will die sooner or later, but your goal is to last long enough to accumulate gold to buy upgrades for your troops, your hero character, and your town.  These upgrades DO carry over.  The challenge continually increases as monsters appear in greater numbers, and more powerful to boot.  And it becomes apparent that you need upgrades in order to advance further in the story mode.The game also comes with a survival mode, and a distance mode.  The survival mode consists of a timer to see how long you last while trying to get troops and dodging enemy fire.  Distance mode involves your character moving from left to right while dodging environmental obstacles and enemy fire.  Both allow you to accumlate gold and possibly unlock new troop units.I purchased this game for $5.24 on sale at Steam, and to me it's money well spent."

The gameplay is really solid -- I've never felt that I've been defeated unfairly -- it always feels to me as though I've screwed up something simple to get myself given out.This game has a whole lot of ""just one more go"" in it... and the nice bit is that almost every go, no matter how poor it turns out, will help advance Brad, his entourage, and the town, just a bit further towards surviving the onslaught of evil.In short, you will get a helluva lot of fun for your $5 (or less, on sale).  The artwork oozes character and style, and so does the writing (which is mostly descriptions of units and items, but still.. the humor and thoughtfulness shine even there).

There is some diversity among the monsters, and a good choice of different followers. Developers have surely been imaginative on that side.It gets boring after a few hours of gameplay, alas.

Buy it when it's on sale for 75% off like I did and you won't feel bad at all. I mean, it's pretty much a slightly more polished Kongregate game and honestly, there are free Kongregate games that are actually more in-depth and flat out more fun to play. I can't write the game off completely because I did get 5 hours worth of play out of it. But honestly it was more because I truly wanted to like the game more than I did because it is sort of an interesting take on tower defense style games and it is fun for a while as you progress and unlock new characters and perks.My biggest gripe with the game is the fact that it's called Bardbarian and the entire premise is based around you controlling the Bard (essentially a pied-piper type character) and everything about the game revolves around music and, well, being a bard. However, the soundtrack is so depressingly lacking, it basically becomes little more than background hum if you play it for any real length of time. Sadly, the ONE song that is the entire soundtrack is actually quite decent. But it's one freaking song. And not even really a complete song but a riff on a loop. I honestly feel that if they were more inventive with the soundtrack and how it played into the game, the $8 asking price would not only have been reasonable, but it would have been a deal. IMO, games like this live and die by their soundtrack and sadly this game died with it's.The overall gameplay is extremely satisfactory for a casual tower defense, the key word here being casual. I mean, you don't aim, you don't shoot anything, there is no placement of towers, you basically weave your band of hand-chosen characters, each with their pros and cons, through waves of increasingly difficult levels. That is, once you start progressing and unlocking more characters with increasingly different character traits. This may sound like an extreme bore but it really is balanced when it comes to difficulty and satisfaction as you unlock new characters and/or perks. Sure, you're only essentially bobbing and weaving and leading your charges into battle but, it's really not as easy as it sounds and there is a real emphasis on choosing your characters and perks wisely.I'm giving this a recommend overall but at a warning that I honestly don't think it's worth the retail price. Put it on your wishlist and catch it on sale. I paid $1.99 during the Summer Sale and feel like I certainly got my money's worth for that price. I certainly don't mind supporting indie devs, especially when they release truly enjoyable content, but at some point, I have to ask myself if the price is worth the product when there are so many similar titles out there that you can play 100% free."

76561198055977195,Recommended,269490,29286816,Posted: 15 January,all,Pantsu,"BardbarianAbout The Game: Bardbarian is a mix between a side scroller hack n'slash, a bullet hell, and a tower defence game. You play as Brad the barbarian, turned bard. It is still your job to defend the town from goblin and demon hordes. This time you let your groupies do all the hard work as you riff and jam about the place. Chose 3 from up to 18 different groupies, along with 16 upgrades between you and the town. After death you get your collected gold to make upgrades, and then try again to beat your record.Pantsu's Rating (out of 5)Graphics: 3.5 Nothing epic but still clean and not really glitchy. Although i find monsters hiding under the bottom HUD.Playability: 4 WSDA movement with changeable hotkeys for summons and solos make the controls enjoyable.Fun: 3.5 This game is pretty fun but after a while it gets tedious keeping your groupies from eating bullets.Sound: 4 Metal jams and solo riffs entertain the ears. The background music is upbeat and keeps the action flowing.Replay Value: 3 There are extra modes including an insane mode, Halloween mode, survival mode, and an escape mode. As for the main game, once you fully upgrade everything there isn't much left to do.Final Score: 3.5Final Thought: At $7.99 it is worth waiting for a sale but on a good note, it is offered in a bundle with another Treefortress game, Jump Jet Rex, and soundtrack for $14.99."
