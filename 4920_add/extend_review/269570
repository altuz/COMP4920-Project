I'm currently working through the tutorials and find they are full of good information on unity and its tools. I can recommend GTGD S1 for anyone that already has a good understanding of programing and just looking to pick up unity development.The author is obviously self-taught and talented but, that said, there are glaring mistakes in code that could be confusing to a novice programmer. His copy and pasting of code instead of creating a function, his misunderstanding of how some construct work and a general lack of OOP can be a bit of a distraction or teach bad habits to a novice developer.I suggest anyone new to software development to find tutorials on C# that focus on “Object Oriented” programming first. Once you have an understanding of the basics these tutorials become more of a “What Can Unity Do” tutorial then a programming tutorial.Even with the issues with the coding, I will recommend this as a good way to learn the basics of unity. The fact that this is based on Unity v3.4 is not that big a deal. The information should migrate to the next version with only a minimal effort; migrating code normal in software development and just another lesson."

76561198012370564,Recommended,269570,11062724,"Posted: 3 July, 2014",all,Untyr,"GTGD is the akronym of ""gamer to game developer"".It's a tutorial series which teaches the basics of developing a game in the Unity 3D engine (you can do 2D games as well, don't worry) by creating a simple multiplayer shooter.It also includes some awesome feature programming like placing blocks.This tutorial series has a very high production value. Both the sound and the resolution of the videos are very good and all the project files and scripts for the finished project are included in the download.The tutor does a good job of explaining all the steps and tasks, not to slow or to fast and with a good amount of detail. Most importantly he does not skip anything, so you won't feel left alone.A big part of this tutorial is coding. Make no mistake there is no way around that if you want to make your own games.That said, even if you are a complete beginner at coding you should be able to follow the tutorial, though I would encourage you to at least read up on some basics (What is a class? What is a function? What is a variable?).You will need them sooner or later anyway no matter what engine or programming language you use.If you are intermediate the scripting won't bore you either. From a software development standpoint the scripts are very well structured, both in the way they interact and in and of themselves.The scripts are kept simple and make no mistake, that is a big endorsement.(If you don't know what I mean google the KISS principle.)Still the tutor does not miss out on important elements of Unity coding and I was very happy to see some co-routine programming included where appropriate.The tutor does an awesome job of commenting everything he writes and explaining what everything does, which makes it very easy to follow his train of thought.If you are an aspiring gamedeveloper, beginner or intermediate, this tutorial series is well worth your money.You do not need to buy any other software since both the game engine Unity 3D and the script editor MonoDevelop are free.Yes, Unity has a commercial ""Unity Pro"" version but you don't need to worry about that at this point. The extra features included there are very specific and well beyond what you need to make most games, not to speak of just getting started in game development.So all you need besides this tutorial is patience and time.Learning takes effort and anyone who tells you otherwise is a charlatan and a liar.But while there is no fast way to become a cometent developer, as far as learning effectiveness, pacing of content and completeness are concerned this is the best you will find.So good luck and many squeals of delight ;)."

This gives you the project files as an example, which is completely unnecessary.  Why did I buy it?  Same reason some people bought that Unturned Gold Membership-- one-time fee supporting the maker.  It's a great series and it's easily understandable, plus it's designed using the free edition of Unity 4.I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to learn the Unity engine.  Why Unity?  It's actually a great engine, and you shouldn't associate it with Air Control or any of that♥♥♥♥♥♥because if you look closely, you can see just how little effort was put into those shovelware titles.While I'd say you should watch them on youtube and decide for yourself whether you actually need project files, the videos themselves are very high-quality and GTGD deserves every donation made from this.These videos teach you Unity's interface, basic knowledge of C#, and more; arguably, they're more helpful than the actual Unity Technologies' tutorial series.If you truly wanted to know why this is on Steam, have a quote from the series creator himself...#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorIt's important to study as many tutorials as time permits if you're into game development. You'll notice though that the overwhelming majority of tutorial creators can't continue regardless of how awesome their tutorials are. By having GTGD S1 on Steam I can fund the future of the series. There's a lot of expense and an incredible amount of time (years in the case of GTGD S1) that goes into making quality tutorials and a lot of people just don't realise that until they also start making tutorials. Relying on self advertising or setting up my own streaming website is a no go and isn't sustainable. Steam is the ideal place for getting game development in front of as many gamers as possible. It was Greenlit after all.--Like this title?  See also:http://store.steampowered.com/app/292350/But don't get that until you've done GTGDS1, that's some pretty high-level stuff."

I've made a few 1-2 (imported) texture landscapes without any objects or anything. I have a good grasp on what each of the different softwares used in this tutorials series does, but very little experience actually using them first-hand (besides c# programming).I'm on video 4 of the series (So take my review with a grain of salt, I may update after I finish the series) and I've just completed creating a projectile object which can be fired from the user as if it were a bullet of some kind. The video is very easy to follow, even using a never version of Unity (not reccommended).I would warn buyers that the video series does not aim to teach you how to code in c# or how to use the different technologies showcased. It's more about following along, monkey-see-monkey-do style so you can see what goes on behind the scenes in game making. You will still need to learn more on your own to understand how everything works (especially the code).For people who have never coded, or used any sort of game development technology, this will be hard to understand - easy to follow. By that I mean. You won't learn a ton about how the C# language works, you might not understand how Unity keeps track of all the objects or how it applies materials, and you might not become a GIMP artist, but you will be opened to a wonderful world of possibilities.I highly suggest anyone without any programming or gamedevelopment experience consider buying this series and following every spoken word to the letter (most important when coding so you can keep track of the variables he's referring to). If you are a parent of gamer children, this would be a good series to get them into so they can get an idea of how games are made.For those with programming experience, you will get the most out of this series if you take a look at the documentation to expand on"

You might even get to play with friends and have fun with it (I know I did).Please note GTGD is a series of videos and unity project files and Unity scripts. It's not a game creation tool like RPGmaker or GameMaker.At my pace it took me about a month to make (there's about 30 videos and I was doing about 1 a day).But one thing this game gave me is memories.I will never forget the pain I suffered when trying to hide the mouse cursor through scripting and the ♥♥♥♥ing amazing feeling I had when it finally worked.And most of all I will never forget fighting back the tears as I finally got my friends to play this game. One thought went through my head that day. ""They're playing a game I made!"" ""They're playing my game!"" ""They played MY game!"" ""They downloaded my game"".Or maybe that's just me.RememberYou are more than a gamer."

The author goes really in depth in most problems anyone will face building a multiplayer system. It is not for the beginner. You have to be able to understand programming concepts like classes, objects, inheritance e.t.c, to follow along. I'd say this is for the intermediate programmer who wants to grasp the multiplayer gaming concept. For that price you really can't go wrong, i mean you get a full set of tools that with a little modification can fit any game and save you many headaches...But again, you have to know what you are doing. This is not ""make my multiplayer game for me""...such thing does not exist. So bottom line, don't get this if you're totally noob and don't understand basing concepts of oop. Absolutely go for it if you have a basic oop backround and want to learn more about multiplayer and networking in general."

What are if... then... statements?) just to be able to troubleshoot if you run into problems with your scripts, especially since he's using an older version of Unity and some of the inputs have changed. And obviously, you can't just raise your hand to ask a question, so you're going to have to be able to interperet what you're seeing on the screen.Overall, really good. I have a French language background, no techinical skills at all (besides an... above the general average? knowledge of how a computer works) decided I wanted to make a game, and I jumped right in with a functional product thanks to this. A+, would learn again."

Non ve ne pentirete."

What happens if the internet suddenly gets 360 Noscoped by the illuminati, and nobody can download games nor view this guys website. Everyone who paid the cheap $2 will be able to view the vids and look at the source code. and if that doesn't convince you. You can minamize it while you work and listen to that nice tasting music.8/8 would make m8 simulator 2008 agian"
