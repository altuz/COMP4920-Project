Also that the Dev was in College/University and this was a ""Free-time"" Project.Now that I have that out of the way, I would love to sit here and tell you how great a game this is. really, I would.... But, Alas, I can not do that. Although I do think the overall game play is enjoyable, there is far too little content to leave one satisfied. The last time this game was updated was Early in 2015 just after the new year, Although it did provide a new level to the dungeon after the first Boss was defeated (Making for 2 Dungeons essentially), sprite upgrades and a few visual fixes, as well as an audio upgrade (Which had to be hot-fixed).The communication attempts towards the Dev on Forums (Even his own website) go unchecked and unanswered. I honestly had a good feeling about this game as I LOVED Desktop Dungeons (Which plays very similar), but it DOES seem like the Dev has just dropped this game, as sad as it is for me to say it.As far as purchasing this game goes, Part of me says buy it for the roughly $5 its at and try to have fun anyway (Like I now do), or play it safe and don't give a cent to a Dev that dropped a game like so many before him have."

Not only has it been months since the last update was released, the developer no longer checks in with the community and ignores forum posts declaring this game abandoned. As it stands now, there simply isn't enough content to ever rationalize purchasing for this game. Moreover, I would be hardpressed to justify putting money in the pocket of a developer who is still selling a game that he clearly has no intention of finishing."

It's unfinished in it';s current form and we won't be getting a conclusion for our money.If the game WAS to be finished it would certainly get a positive review from me as it does what it sets out to do, but only if you consider what it would have had if it was finished.Good game, but not complete and not worth paying any money for right now. If I couuld get a refund I would.UPDATED: The game still has no updates. I've notice 0 people find this helpful, but I'm not sure what could be more helpful than informing potential buyers that the game is unfinished and the developer has gone silent.There is never an excuse for silence from a game developer relying on Early Access sales to finish their game.If the developer is creating alt accounts to downvote negative reviews, or using friends to do so, then it really is a sad state of affairs.2 years on with no update and no intent from the developer. I think that speaks for itself."

It plays fine and the aesthetics are nice, but I feel like it might be a bit brutal in terms of difficulty.I mean, I also said the same thing about the Binding of Isaac when I first played it, but I feel like I always had more control over what I was doing in BoI then I do here.I've had several instances where opening up a door on the SECOND FLOOR of the dungeon gets me into a situation where I've bitten off more monsters than I can chew (yes I'm funneling them into the doorway to fight them one at a time). Sure you can escape, but monsters aren't stupid enough to not chase you down or flee when they're hurt."

Much more into a free-roaming/mission oriented level/gear based game such as Diablo. However, that being said, there is quite a lot of strategy within this game (aside from the gear and levels) which I enjoy. It's addictive, and even though it was hard to grasp and I found myself dying a lot, you learn the ins and outs fairly quick.I'd definitely recommend this game to someone that is new to these kinds of games. It was easy to grasp."

Period.It is turned based, meaning for every action you take or over movement you make, the monsters also take a turn.  You can't out-move or click your mouse fast to get extra strikes on them... that will get you killed fast, trust me, hehe.  Instead, take your time, plan strategically in your battles and movement, and that is where this game shines.'There is tons of loot, store 'rooms' inside the dungeon that you can find where you can pawn your junk and buy needed gear.  There is level ups that give you points to add to stats, new special abilities/spells to add, and new perks to unlock.  Add to this all the real feeling you get of 'exploring' the dungeon as rooms are revealed from the darkness as you explore them, and this game is a simple, but deep and very fun little gem.This game is worth three times it's asking price.  After playing it, I am hooked, and if I had to go back and buy it again, I'd gladly give $14.99 USD for it after spending some time with it!  It's THAT good.  ""Must Buy"" if you like RPGs and especially if you believe a games heart isn't in its graphics."

I can give you a few tips i know so far so here they are:1- IF you feel that your character is about to die or cant find an escape like teleportation scrolls or a nearby portal simply load your data before death or else it will be gone 4 ever2- Closing the doors when enemy has spotted you they can open it again (one of the reasons i died)3- This is a cheap trick but useful. save everytime you find a unknown potion or a scroll and use them. that way if its a bad one you can load it up again and thats how i saved my map scroll.well i hope that helps. and happy dungeons!

I no longer recommend this game.  It is still a fun game, and if you just want to experience all roguelikes finished or unfinished you should definitely give this one a try, but otherwise this is just incomplete and not worth anyone's time and money anymore.  I'm leaving my old review intact below, in case it appeals to someone.  FYI, this review had 96% approval before switching to ""not recommended"".-----------------------------------If you can't tell from the number of hours I've played it, I really love this game.  If I were to design my own roguelike, it would pretty much start out like this one.As a fan of roguelikes, Claustrophobia really hits the spot when I feel hungry for some beatdown, both given and taken.  I'll be cruising along, crushing little monsters, looting some neat gear, until I hit a room full of monsters looking at me funny.  I died to many such rooms until I learned a few tricks that made it easier, and even then I would still die, mainly from making ""stupid"" mistakes.  An unforgiving roguelike?  Now there's a tautology if I ever saw one.About the Early Access status...  I've given feedback for many games in the past (not only on Steam) but I've never seen a developer be so receptive to his players' comments.  The interaction is timely and courteous; the developer is a real professional in every sense of the word.  This tells me this little gem of a game will grow to become something quite extraordinary.  With a 5$ pricetag, it is a steal."

I appreciate the simplicity and complexity that comes along with roguelikes and this is a great example. The Simple interface, idea and execution is on point, I love it. One of my favorite games for quite a bit. I can just open the program and play for any amount of time. That is the beauty of a dungeon crawler such as this. But I must warn not a game for every sort of person, If you are willing to try a new genre go for it, but If you are not to open to new game types then steer away. Overall a very good game and I have enjoyed my time spent in it. Good job developers, you have done a wonderful job."

And i love it like the first moment,because i like the combination of Rogue like and tacticel decisions.The first time i died in the First 1,2 Floors. ( I need 10 restarts?!)Because of the Random Building of the Dungeons it is interesting everytime and i dont get bored at all.Now i am at NG+2 (New Game 2).Pro`s and Kon`sPro:- Random generated Dungeons all the TIme, so it is interesting to explore them all the time.- You got a lot of Classes and you can skill them complete unique.- A lot of Loot and drops.- You can find different Spells to get stronger.- (and many More)Kon:At the moment i got no Negativ Point to tell it you.The only thing i hate its the Scroll of Equip destruction, i missclicked twice.... Wasnt that cool.Guys, when u arent a fan of Rogue Like Games, give this Game a try anyway. And when you are a fan, you will love it!Think about that the game is in Early access .

There are some minor things about the game though.It does lack atmosphere, and the music is AWFULL! .. (you can turn it of, and have some decent atmospheric music on the stereo)..

,Not Recommended,269590,12293980,"Posted: 29 September, 2014",all,DaffyZZ,"I beat this early access game once. As stated in the description, this is more of a demo/proof of concept than a game as of this date that you can support. It is very short and shallow. Everything levels up with your character so RNG has little impact currently. I really hope the author introduces more RNG that forces you to make strategic decisions on what limited resources you consume each new game. I also feel like using the skills should be more strategic and possibly buffed instead of just resting and using them all every fight. The resting mechanic should be removed or changed to make this possible. I don't think a cooldown system can work well and maybe should be changed to a energy/mana system with limited replenishment. It is early access, so I have hope it will become a great game!"
