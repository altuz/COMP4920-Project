76561197997284461,Recommended,269610,8906720,"Posted: 29 January, 2014",all,MustardJeep,"It's early access yet (01/29/14) so the game is not complete, but what is there is very promising.Arcane Worlds takes up the same style of game play as the Magic Carpet series put out by BullFrog in 1994. In the intervening two decades nobody has taken up the gauntlet and offered up such a destructable world. It's not bullet holes and burn marks slapped up when you miss but burning trees and craters gouged out of the landscape. Even though the roster of spells is only about half filled the expectation is there; There is no problem that can't be solved with some magic.The developer is doing everything right and I can't imagine early access on steam was an easy decision.  I have no doubts that single player will eventually become a fully realized spiritual successor to the Magic Carpet style of gameplay. The frustrating part of this is going to be waiting while the developer keeps up the same quality job implementing the rest of the game. Looking forward to each new update adding Spells or other game play features,  and since I am sure the Dev will be sick of it not going to compare Arcane Worlds to Magic Carpet again. But it really is well done and unique with a great sense of art design.ProsWhat's there works, and is a professional job! Single Player, the Spells that are currently present, creatures, magic portals, multiple worlds, and the redoing the landscaping all work and every single part of that looks great.ConsIt's very early access. Only about half of the spells are in place, an odd choice of mana collector models, and a bare minimum of creatures to provide mana. Also there is no ""dungons & dragons"" style story or missions in place yet so frankly it's very very early access at this point. The biggest problem is the simple fact that the game is early access and not ""done""."

Look no further than Arcane Worlds.The first thing I noticed was the cheat options.  While I lasted at least 20 minutes before succumbing to the temptation, I found that the game is so lacking in features that I had little else left to do besides cheat.  Once you give yourself the mana cheat and the ALL SPELLS cheat....  Rapid-fire volcanology awaits!  Many other available spells vie for your interest as well, but they all pale in comparison to the mighty volcano spell.SO.... $10 for a quality physics simulator which (I have not yet been able to crash, although I can drop framerate to abysmal levels) where I get to turn the entire world into a volcano over the course of an hour and a half?  Count me in!Players:  You are ALREADY getting a quality physics fluids simulator in a procedurally generated (rather small/wrapping) world for just $10.  Go for it.  This is more entertaining and less buggy than a LOT of other crap out there on Steam (and other ware stores).To the dev:  Well done sir!  Now you face the daunting task of adding meaningful gameplay to this fantastic world simulator you have created.  I wish you the best of luck and encourage players to follow this game closely as things develop."

It looked like an awesome idea and that's about all I went on when I bought it.This game really surprised me though. I played it way too long for its actual gameplay. I guess it's because of the thrill of exploring an uncharted world, the need to get more spells to be even more powerful and see the absolute chaos that your power can bring to the world. To be able to shape it in any way that you want. I mean let's be honest here... Who wouldn't want to be a powerful mage soaring through the sky, killing evil black things that are hostile and gaining more powers as you explore new worlds?I for one am pleased, for once, that I followed my 'ooooo shiny' impulse.

76561198007955955,Recommended,269610,12608411,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,WarMouse,"Having played Arcane Worlds since v0.19 I think every new build has brought something new to the table. Progress on the game might not be fast given that there is only one developer but it is certainly steady and v0.25 is almost like a different game to v0.19 now. One of the first major surprises for me was just how much better the randomly generated worlds looked after the generation code was revamped to build the worlds around the gameplay elements rather than the other way around. Before colours were mostly the same and random terrain was sort of thrown together. Now you will find pillars, lakes, valleys, forests and more with proper palettes that all fit together very well in making a believable and natural-looking random world. Couple those elements with terrain effecting spells like Fracture and Volcano you can actually have a lot of fun just terraforming worlds and customising them to your liking.Spells are no longer found randomly on worlds like previous builds and instead you will find runes which you use on crafting worlds to create new spells. This gives you some early goals to work towards as different spells require different runes so you have to scavenge worlds for the rune types needed for the spells you want. Certain worlds will be easier to conquer if you have the right spells and certain puzzles might require a specific spell to solve.A much-needed interactive tutorial has been added so anybody not already familiar with the old Magic Carpet games will now have the basic movement, combat and crafting mechanics explained to them. You don't get everything handed to you on a plate though so you still have to figure out what those circles are and what to do with them.Several improvements to the map make locating items on worlds much more easily. Un-triggered circles are marked as are creatures and mana gatherers and there is a line back to your castle so navigating is much easier. In the universe map you can also check if you have missed anything on worlds you have visited which is pretty useful.Difficulty has increased on v0.25 as your starting mana is now lower and you can't just rain fireball death on enemies right away so you have to fly more evasively until you have added some mana to your castle allowing you to sustain your fire rate for longer periods. Dark worlds are a new addition and whilst I don't want to ruin the surprise I will say that poorly prepared Wizards are going to have a bad time in these! One of my early criticisms of the game was that it was a little too easy and creatures offered no real threat to you which is now being addressed.The game is also moddable which is fairly unusual for an alpha-build game. The scripts in the /gen/ folder are not only responsible for world generation but also the gameplay elements so there is a lot that can be done to tweak and customise the game. There isn't much in the way of documentation (or even comments) so the difficulty curve for modding is currently quite high but I expect this to change as the game develops further.Arcane Worlds is a truly amazing experience for an alpha and I can't recommend it enough regardless of whether you ever played Magic Carpet or not.I should point out that as the game is DRM-free many people (including myself) usually aren't logged into Steam when I play so the ""played"" hours count (3.5) is far from correct for me at least. I think I will have to change that!"

It correctly does everything it's supposed to do. Features an interesting fluid simulation with a few proper ways to test it out, very low system requirements, runs smooth, and is difficult to even deliberately cause performance loss. It has beautiful landscapes, water, music. and a charming atmosphere. I think the dev should take what they've done here and make a different kind of game, something with more standard mechanics and / or add features like an on-foot mode and such to this game. Don't get it if you're looking for a full game. There isn't one, just a heartwarming, nostalgia-inducing tech demo."

The psychicis of water and lava are just flawless making it intresting to to play about with these. The game cosept is alrady taking shape. Right now I feel in it like in a world editor. I can't wait for the next updates. This game is worth buying even right now when it is in a early alpha. This game leaves you with a feeling of being a god in the world you can either flood it or burn it with fire.Cleanse it from the evil of the  swarms of creatures.

It is basically a sandbox for you to mess around in, and it is quite a good sandbox. You have a variety of spells, ranging from waterfalls and volcanos to placing turrets and buildings. There is a mode where you need to collect resources to craft spells, but I have not tried it.ComponentsVisuals- This game has charming but fairly simplistic graphics. They are very beautiful and make for some epic screenshots. The flow of water and lava is mesmerising and the enemy design is fascinating. The visuals of Arcane Worlds are splendid and pleasing.Audio- The audio in this game is fairly basic. You have sounds for shooting your spells and enemies make noises. A fairly generic-sounding battle music plays when you engage in a fight with hostile creatures. The sound design isn't particularly good.Gameplay- Arcane Worlds doesn't feature much in terms of any meaningful gameplay. There are enemies you can kill which drop mana, which can be collected by special gatherers that float above a castle. There really is no point yet for mana gathering. However, the sandbox gameplay is really quite spectacular. The whole world can be deformed and sculpted, and this game also features impressive fluid physics. Carving out valleys and shooting a water source spell, and watching the water pour out and flow through the valley and eventually fill up, it something really special. I love good fluid physics and this game truly delivers. You can even make volcanoes pop up out of the ground anywhere you wish, and then they spew out lava and it's just magnificent.Story- N/aFunctionality- This game runs fairly well and has adequate graphical settings. However, creating mass amounts of volcanoes at once severely decreases the FPS, but this isn't really an issue (unless you like to spam volcanoes everywhere!).ProsBeautiful visualsIncredible fluid physics, a great joy to toy withInteresting spells which greatly affect the environmentRuns smoothly for the most partFrequent updates! There's so much more to come in terms of gameplay features!Really cool enemy design.ConsMinimal gameplayTerrain can't be deformed to make caves (I'm pretty sure this game uses heightmaps as opposed to voxels, so this means that you can't have any hollow space below ground)Quite a small number of spellsThe sound and music aren't very goodConclusionArcane Worlds is a great little game that will give you hours of fun with the world-deforming spells. While lacking in gameplay, the sandbox kept me entertained for over 13 hours.If you're looking for a fun sandbox reminiscent of Magic Carpet, then I highly suggest Arcane Worlds.I give this game a 6/10."

It`s just ""kill monsters, gather manna, build a castle , rinse, repeat"".And it also seems to me from other comments and the long wait without any major changes, that it`s been abandoned, which is a shame as it has potential.Edit:- 2016 & it`s still Early Access - draw your own conclusions.I`d suggest anyone interested in this game download the demo - (you`ll get as much out of that as the full game).

The develepors should be hanging their heads in shame for offering such an incomplete piece of software for purchase.I would get more entertainment throwing a $10 bill into the toilet and watching my money swirl after flushing.If I gave $10 to a bum who used the money to buy malt liquor and a crack rock I would be doing the world more good than paying for this 'game'This is complete and utter trash.  I am disappointed in Steam for offering this steaming pile of code and frankly it should be a crime to sell to an honest customer.I have taken my lumps in the past by buying games that I ended up not playing and I have never complained, but this time it is negligence on the part of Steam.  Even though this 'game' is Early Access it is supposed to be playable and it is nothing short of fraud in my opinion to call this a playable game."
