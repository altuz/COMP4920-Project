Yeah it's an iOS port but it's a good port that one ups it's the original. PC version exclusively includes local co-op mode, vs. mode and full gamepad support. Best of all it includes a level editor. Personally I loved this game for the first few hours, it's addicting and the puzzles are fun. Although I did get bored of it after a while, then again I can see how other people love this game, there is so much content. Especially when playing with an extra person. The visuals are top notch but the gameplay is a bit like flappy bird (please don't give me crap for this). I know, this game came before flappy bird but we all know this game overshadowed this. The controls are very well responsive, so if you die it is your own doing. It does get a little repetitive and times and frustrating but it is fun. 7/10"

Take your fluffy winged friends through bad lands and navigate obstacles as you immerse yourself into this wild adventure. I suggest using a headphone to appreciate the game environment.The objective is to safely negotiate each level while also trying to save as many clones as possible. There are power ups that speed up the flight or slow you down. The remaining ones either bulk you up or shrink you to a tiny spot on screen. I really enjoy using the latter.It all comes down to timing the flight well. Its challenging and fun. Fun because the key bindings are very simple and, challenging because you gotta be one step ahead and use exactly the required number of power ups to either squeeze through or wreck your way in a big way!How you fail a level you ask? Get ready to receive a good crushing from falling rocks and heavy machinery. Or just stop flight and let the moving screen drag over you and pop your eyes open! And the respawn starts at very convenient checkpoints, so there is no frustration over repeated tries unlike the flappy bird game where you just wanna crush those wide lipped 'birds' for being flappy for nothing!The ""Colorful Side Scroll Edition"" AwardI rate this game 10/10"

Made by a finnish studio Frogmind. Previously only for mobile devices, this game has been ported to Steam-powered devices.Gameplay.It's a one-button physics game: touching the screen causes a troupe of silhouetted gremlins to fly forward and upward; releasing your finger allows them to float to the ground.Yes, the controls are really easy and intuitive. You can play either with your keyboard or gamepad. To be not too much casual, this game will push on you by moving screen to the right - any furball that goes off-screen dies. And the first levels are easy but the following require more patience and concentration. But don't get discouraged, the game isn't made to be hard and there are usually checkpoints before and after more demanding parts of levels.BADLAND: Game of the Year Editionis artistically beautiful, with gorgeous background art, highly detailed level design, and incredible sound design (great game to put on nice headphones to feel game atmosphere).The side of art design and atmosphere it's on a whole new level.This game is available on the Play Store -BADLANDandBADLAND 2and I was very happy when I saw him here in the Steam and in sale (€1.99). As I knew the game, I don't think twice. I recommend buying on sale because the full price I think is very expensive when you have free play on the mobile version. But the game is very good.BADLAND: Game of the Year Editionmaintains the same good structure and beautiful appearance of the original on mobile system.It has a level of professionalism rarely seen to PC ports, and a level of immersion and beauty rarely seen in games as a whole.CurrentlyBADLANDis available on all mobile platforms, and has been released as GOTY Edition for Xbox One, PS4, PS3, PS Vita, Wii U and Steam.BADLANDhas been downloaded more than 45 million times. The sequel,BADLAND 2, was launched in December 2015 and continued the success of the original.With all these things, this game is easy to reccommend. I encourage you to get it: it’s a lovely experience, a wonderfully fun puzzle game, and a beautiful audiovisual presentation.Positive points. (+)Absolutely gorgeous art style.Incredibly good world design.Very simple gameplay.100 singleplayer levels, 100 multiplayer levels and 27 battle levels.Excellent level design.Most levels have very frequent checkpoints which is great if you die a lot.A wide variety of pick-ups, many of which change the appearance of your clones.Lots of interaction with the environment to avoid traps and complete puzzles.Negative points. (-)A few levels don't have checkpoints which is rather frustrating.Apart from in the trailer there isn't really a story which is somewhat disappointing."

I recommend this to everyone with to much time on their hands :P Because once you start playing you can't stop. The game designers really though this one through. It's hard enough to be absolutely sure you won't make it, but in the end you always do because in the previous level they taught you everything you needed to know to finish this level succesfully.

,Recommended,269670,30692751,Posted: 23 March,all,Spidey,"Badland is gameplay-wise a wholesome, simplistic, and very fun sidescroller, which will occupy you for a long time with its uniquely challenging puzzles. But on the side of art design and atmosphere it is on a whole new level, rivaling some of the best indie games out there. It has a level of professionalism rarely seen in iOS to PC ports, and a level of immersion and beauty rarely seen in games as a whole.Gameplay:Badland is not mechanically deep, nor does it need to be. The gameplay is simple: get your small flying creature to the end of the level. There are puzzles, level geometry, and machines which stand in your way, and powerups which can serve as either a benefit or a hassle, and the levels dramatically increase in difficulty. Originally released on iOS devices, Badland was controllable with one button (or more accurately, one touch), but for this Game of the Year release, it has been rebalanced for a new control scheme allowing the player to move in any direction, with levels modified to accommodate, which adds an extra layer of depth and challenge. The controls feel incredibly fluid and smooth, and the game makes use of a realistically applied physics engine to increase the vivid, immersive feel of the movement and the game itself. There are even multiplayer and coop modes, local and playable with up to four players on one keyboard.This game gets much harder than you’d think! But I totally recommend you playing in Co-op with friends having on your TV with big picture mode with controllers! Playing with friends take the game to the next level and makes it more fun.Art:Badland is artistically beautiful, with gorgeous background art, highly detailed level design, and incredible sound design, the latter of which is some of the best I've heard in any game. It immerses you in an atmospheric world of nature and beauty and mysterious machines. The silhouette level design reminds me of Limbo, but has its own unique feel within the context of this game as well.The story is told by the images in the background and how they evolve over time. Eventually you begin to question the world you are in, what happened to make it like this, and what role this small creature has to play. The atmosphere is sometimes peaceful and sometimes rather creepy. The visual art and level design are supplemented by the incredible sound design, immersive, ambient and very realistic. This is a great game to put on nice headphones, sit back and relax, and play, and it has a feature called “Flow Mode” which provides uninterrupted gameplay and minimalistic, text-free UI which is gorgeous and one of my favorite things about this game.Badland is truly a must try game with stunning visuals, awesome gameplay supporting 4 player co-op, Steam Achievements & Steam Trading cards support! GO FOR IT!!! 9/10"

,Not Recommended,269670,25850188,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,HudsonWolf,"Badland is one of those games that, at a glance, seems like it must be good. Visually, it's very impressive. It has simple core gameplay with some neat mechanics. Unfortunately, after giving this game chance after chance, I'd have to say that none of that means this game is actually any good.It's not all about the controls, but that's as fair a place as any to start. Trying to control your fluffy blob thing is a chore - it feels like simply to play the game you have to fight a constant battle against the controls. In open space, it isn't utterly terrible, but if you have the misfortune of contacting any background object? Anything could happen, and in this game, 'anything' generally means you end up falling off the left side of the screen to your death. This is especially an issue when you run into a 'puzzle'. There are basically two kinds of puzzles: one where you have to die repeatedly smashing yourself into the environment to figure out what part of it moves, and one where you know immediately what you have to do but trying to actually convince the controls to do that takes a frustratingly large number of attempts. Neither are particularly innovative.Now, to be fair, I haven't even mentioned the wide variety of powerups you can get. You can get a wide variety of powerups, most of which are used purely for the riveting gameplay of 'pick up exactly the right powerups or you die'. There are also 'clone' and 'superclone' powerups which give you a small (or large) army of fluffy blobs, and the levels that essentially amount to 'send your army of dudes through this obstacle course at high speed' are actually moderately fun. Far too often, though, having multiple dudes just means you'll eventually have to try to control multiple dudes at once (remember the controls? yeah, they're terrible) to do different things. This exponential misery is especially great because there's no way to actually control them separately - often you're reduced to smashing several dudes at a dividing point and hoping they end up going down different paths so that they can do whatever they need to do to advance you in the level.There's also a fairly well-documented phenomenon where the background of the level becomes extremely dark, which as you might imagine makes everything worse. I have no idea whether it's a bug, but every time I experienced it, restarting the game caused it to stop happening.The last straw (not as in 'the straw that broke the camel's back', as in the last chronological straw piled on the back of a camel that is already dead oh god why are you adding more straws) came when I decided that I would play through the entire game before reviewing it, regardless of how painful that might be, so that I could really give a complete picture of the game, and just in case it somehow magically became a good game right near the end. I fought my way to the next-to-last level (lasers, by the way, are quite a nice mechanic and it's a shame they're only in the last few levels), got a fair distance into it, and the game crashed to desktop. I opened it up again, got a bit farther this time, and it crashed again. I opened it up a third time, and it immediately crashed the first time I tried to pause.So, I mean, if you want a game to look at, it's great. If you want good gameplay, on the other hand, you might be better off looking elsewhere.Honestly, though, even if you really think you want this game, just get the (free) mobile version. I wouldn't be surprised if the controls are smoother there as well."

The crashes are random but they always occur at about the middle of the level, and force you to start it again from the beginning. If you press escape to bring up the menu after every new checkpoint the game saves it so you can continue from them after you start it up again, but it breaks the flow of the game and is very annoying. I contacted support, but after waiting 2 weeks they just replied that they are aware that this happens with a few people with nvidia gpus on levels with lasers, but have no idea how to fix it. Because of this i cannot reccomend this game."

It still is! And when I saw it was ported onto Steam, I bought it ASAP. What do I think of the port? It's great. It can be a bit unnerving to be able to go backwards now, unlike the mobile version, but it is a very minor problem that I quickly adjusted to.The art is fantastic, the atmosphere sometimes sunny, sometimes scary, but always mysterious. There is no soundtrack, but the ambience and sound effects greatly add to the tone.This version has bonus worlds, which really expands the game from what it used to be.And multiplayer has never been better. It was amazing on Android, the great race against your friends to see who can best survive the chaotic environment. Not only does this game have more unique multiplayer levels, it also has an added co-op too!The power-ups are fun, I love becoming a mammoth beast that crushes everything, or a swarm of swift creatures that are difficult to kill in numbers.The difficulty of levels increases nicely too, and I never find myself too frustrated to continue the game.So do I reccomend this game?

I spent more time looking at the background, than playing the game. I would gladly pay $5 for a game like this on my phone, but on the computer? I didn't spend thousands to play mobile games. The mechanics are intriguing, and I haven't seen them before, but they're nothing groundbreaking. The issue with the puzzles is that rather than you needing to approack it at a diffeent angle, like in Portal, you instead only need quick reflexes, as the solutions are obvious.I digress. If you're interested in an artsy, but frustrating game, go ahead.Overall, 21/100, and only for the art."

Of course, most of the time I get killed. And when you get some clones, it gets worse, cause they stuck into everything, and blocks your path all the time.The concept of the game is good, but I feel it was not executed very well.

It's a great game with lots of challenging levels and a really good art style, but I will have to say, I don't think it's worth the full price of 10 dollars. The mobile version of the game is 5 dollars and thats basically the same thing. If you're going to buy this game, buy it on sale."
