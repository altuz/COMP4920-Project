,Not Recommended,269710,27297393,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Ander,"Solving puzzles consists of determining a way of clearing blocks in the correct order.  This isn't a matter of searching for longer matches amongst a sea of options, just figuring out the right order to remove blocks - it's not using the same mechanic as other match 3 games, and it's not employing the same skills.  I didn't enjoy it, for whatever that's worth."
,Recommended,269710,24604702,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,LotS,"I've long lamented the lack of new quality battle puzzle games in the vein of Tetris Attack and Meteos.  Tumblestone's multiplayer mode is the first thing to scratch that itch for me since Planet Puzzle League came out on the DS all the way back in 2007.The game overall involves several stacks of colored stones (tumblestones) at the top of the screen and you need to ""shoot"" (for lack of a better word) 3 of the same-colored tumblestone in a row to clear them.  You only have access to the first row of tumblestones so you need to avoid getting into a situation where you cannot get at three tumblestones of the same color.  In multiplayer you have three modes.  Puzzle Race involves up to four players trying to be the first to clear an identical board of tumblestones.  If you get into a state where you cannot continue clearing the board, you need to reset and start again.  In Battle the tumblestones slowly move downward.  If the tumblestones hit the bottom, you are eliminated.  If you find yourself in a state where you cannot get to three same-colored tumblestones in a row,  you have no choice byt to make a ""bad move"" (where you shoot a tumblestone followed by a different-colored tumblestone) which causes the tumblestones to shift downwards several rows instantly.  The goal is to be the last surviving player.  Tug of War seems pretty similar to Puzzle Race, but involves multiple sections of smaller puzzles.  There are also a variety of modifiers available for each mode that I haven't gotten the chance to play with yet.  All of the modes require the player to balance speed with trying to plan ahead.  Battle in particular is very compelling and evokes a similar feeling to other classic battle puzzle games while also providing a pretty refreshing take on a match-3 puzzle game.I should point out that for $9.99 you get only the multiplayer component.  For an extra $14.99 you get a full single player campaign (you can upgrade at any time).  If you're interested in the game primarily as a battle puzzle game, you should know that the campaign is not a series matches against bots like it is in some puzzle games, but is instead a series of predetermined puzzle boards for you to solve.  I'm finding this pretty fun as well, but obviously it's a very different feel from the multiplayer mode.  If it doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then you should stick to the base $9.99 multiplayer package."

,Recommended,269710,24292608,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,XT,"This game is great. It's simple by design, but it can also prove to be a challenge with the many modes and modifiers it has to offer.Tumblestone is a puzzle game that has you matching 3 of the same colors in order to eliminate them. Very easy to pick up game.I originally bought the multiplayer edition to try things out. Safe to say, it was a blast! Playing against other players in various modifiers and modes was great, but I got stumped many times. You can even give your friends a free code to download a multiplayer version of the game to play with you!After getting absolutely rekt in multiplayer, I decided to upgrade to the full game to fully explore what it has to offer.Story Mode is intersting. I haven't gotten far in the story yet, but it's safe to say it had me going for about an hour trying to figure out the puzzles I got stumped on (i'm looking at you 1-28). I hope to finish it soon, but rest assured, you won't be bored with the story mode. Also, by playing through it, you can unlock more modes and characters!Arcade mode is great too. 3 modes, infnipuzzle, heartbeat (i think), and marathon. All 3 are very fun and a great time killer, with heartbeat being my favorite (fast and intense mode!)Overall, I say this game is well worth it. I've barely scratched the surface, but I know I'm going to play the heck out of this game when I have the time.My only complaint is the lack of chat in multiplayer mode and the playerbase. Then again, this game did just get released at the same time of Necropolis, a very hyped up game. I hope to see more people play this!Both versions are well worth it, but I'd highly reccomend the full game to fully experience Tumblestone.Thanks for reading!"

It can get addicting and frustrating at some parts because if you make one mistake you have to restart the whole puzzle. Overall, I would definitely recommend it."
