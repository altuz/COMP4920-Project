The surrealistic backdrops and bright colors are truly wonderful. The constant storms, the overlay of winds that manipulate the lighting does add to the chaos of our assigned absinthe addicts mind. It adds to the madness. It's a 2D game in a 3D plane, which gives way to a plethora of amazing art-decisions. There are houses, cliffs, rubble, just floating around, sometimes in front of our screen - this can be incredibly annoying while doing some of the more precise platforming since it obfuscates our path, but it could be intentional to make an otherwise easy game a bit harder(bad way of doing that though). But the 3D and the more modern graphics - if you compare it to other indiegames - is a nice change in the way of storyfocused 2D platformers. Spate always give you something to look at, you will never be bored, visually.The gameplay is bog standard, but for the most part it's well done, relatively fun and doesn't bring too much frustration to the overall beauteous atmosphere. Parts of the gameplay are not really enjoyable, and doesn't really partake in the physics that the game otherwise upholds. It didn't make sense and it felt contrived. I am mostly referring to the parts where you used a cannon. Especially when you use a cannon to shoot balls into a basket that at the same time moves up and down, it felt out of place and I also fps-dropped in these parts of the game, which made it even worse.These were however short enough to not ruin the experience, but annoying nonetheless. These stops in movement made the game stagnate a bit, it ruined the flow and atmosphere in a way, for me. It felt really gamey, it snapped you out of the game and into a world where you are playing a game, trying to time a frustrating, fps-dropping ball into a bowl which seemingly made nothing happen. It didn't really give you the feedback you needed either to understand that you progressed. Or maybe I was just not paying attention in my boredom. Otherwise the gameplay is okay, but perhaps not the main draw of the game.The story was interesting. But in a way that reminded me of Contrast, it didn't get it across in the best way possible. The end seemed rushed, lackluster in a way, the death of his daughter didn't really seem to have been absolved. That could just be the ending I chose, the mindless optimist that I am. Which some people may enjoy being there, but it seemed out of character and trivialized the daughters death.There was also some weird writing, where the robot calls attention to the protagonists alcohol problem and he answer in anger, just after he himself have admitted to it being a problem. It felt like it was forced to give way for a dialogue later on. A dialogue infected by cliché.The narrator is this deep voiced guy: Jack Bair, sort of sounds like Morgan Freeman and he really makes the narration a joy to listen to. It's a third person telling of what you're doing in the way of Bastion, only it's the protagonist talking from his point of view. And apart from some trite observations, or ""ruining"" - perhaps confirming - the symbolism you yourself get from the background, the narrator does really add to the game. It's simply great.So Spate has its moments. It can be hilarious at times, it can be depressing at others. It does illustrate the delirium of an absinthe drinker. It's worthwhile for everything that it is. And for everything that it tries to be. It's intelligent, quirky, surreal, humorous, pretty, colorful. It has spirit.Hehe"

It definitely got the artsy walking simulator part down, but the story is really... boring. It's essentially ""gosh, absinthe/alcoholism sure did ruin my life, but now it's the only thing keeping me going. Also I'm sad that I lost my wife and child."" repeated about 30 times with different wordings. The ending bashes you in the face with symbolism that would make an English teacher proud. ""Climbing this tower represents his struggle with alcoholism. The boss at the end sustains his life by feeding off the souls of those around him, just like the main character destroys those around him with his alcoholism.""The platforming bits are alright, but nothing particularly special. And though it might seem petty, I really didn't like the narrator's 1920's New Yorker accent - just didn't seem to fit the character at all. I like these kinds of games for their interesting stories, and this one's just too shallow and unengaging."

A brilliant set up for a story and nothing more needs to be said about that.Spate is a nice little platformer that you should have no trouble finishing in around 2 hours. There aren't really any enemies to speak of in the traditional platforming sense; Spate is more about platforming and then interacting with characters and objects. Does that make it a puzzle platformer? Not really, no.  I wouldn't call anything I came across in this game a puzzle, and to be honest the controls didn't feel particularly tight so it wasn't particularly good as a platformer either, but since nothing too much is expected of you it doesn't really matter that much. In terms of gameplay Spate isn't sounding that good on paper, but it still somehow manages to be a good game.There are a few things that make Spate a bit special. Being able to drink a seemingly unlimited supply of absinthe as you navigate through the world adds an extra element I haven't seen in many games. The effects of the absinthe warp the screen and environment around you. It makes jumping a little floatier and can affect how some environmental objects function too. While drinking isn't really necessary, you'll find yourself doing it often just for the hell of it. Just like in real life ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)What really goes a long way towards making Spate a good game is the fact that it has well thought out audio. The moody string instrument soundtrack adds to the atmosphere of the dark and deranged art style. Spate is narrated by a Christopher Walken sounding man - it's actually Jack Bair, but I've not heard of him before now. Just imagine someone that sounds a bit like Christopher Walken. The only thing I wish was done differently in Spate is that they could have voice acted the dialogue as well as the narration. Having a well done narration (although Jack Bair lacks emotion in some parts where he's meant to be quite upset) makes it seem quite jarring when dialogue appears and it is text only.I played the game through using only my Xbox 360 controller and it worked very well. There aren't many buttons required, but controller support was good.I'd recommend Spate based on the art style, the drinking effects, and the narration/music - although it only just scrapes in on the recommendation line for me. Spate is a fairly simple little platformer, but it shows a lot of promise and I look forward to seeing more games from Eric Provan - Ayyo Games.6.5 out of 10 - Would press X to drink again."

I couldn't quite put my finger on why this was; was it intentional as in an attempt to make the player choose themselves to drink as doing so makes the world go warbly and often has some visual effect while additionally allowing the character to jump higher. Perhaps identify with the character more or was this just an area for the narration to take place.Don't expect a challenge here, the game doesn't control that well but it never asks you to do anything that demands much attention. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky as far as clipping and sticky walls though.THE GISTThis game exists somewhere between the meta-physical and allegorical. The specifics are kind of left for you to decide, it sort of leans on the absinthe angle while introducing the world with newspaper headlines so it's a little unclear. It's far from being a great game but it's certainly not a bad game.Follow my curation for more"
,Recommended,269810,14059160,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,bonnup,"As the video game medium evolves into a more comprehensive experience, mechanically defined genres have blurred, thematic material and atmosphere emerging as the most accurate descriptions of games. Spate is neither a platformer nor a two-degrees-of-freedom walking simulator; it is a psychological thriller, ripe with counterplay between its prominent mechanic and its aesthetic intentions.The Negs --Spate is a game that relies heavily on illusion and atmosphere. You are held in harrowing hallucinations as much as the protagonist, but this captivation spirals down the drain faster than a slick steamer in a Taco Bell toilet whenever you speak with the main NPC, a comedic relief robot that passes for funny only in abrupt contrast with the otherwise somber environment. The game's exposition switches between text box (for conversations with NPCs) and voiced narration for the protagonist's thoughts. The text boxes aren't the best writing and they have several grammatical errors (as does the store page description if you care to look for them), but the real issue is in the execution of these internal monologues. The writing for these is slightly less obtuse than store-brand cereal names. In a genre that demands vague motivations and misleading actions to unsettle the player's own thoughts, this title was rather direct in all things. Any misdirection by the narrator is almost immediately recanted and explained. Interpretation is unheard of. Also, these narrative monologues come up in one of the 6 distinct gameplay portions. These are open straightaways (wherein the long narration occurs), NPC interactions, platforming segments, sliding sections, ""Angry Birds"" mini-games, and ""Helicopter Game"" mini-games (you know, the one we all used to play on public school computers with the bright green cavern walls and terrible collision boxes where you click to fly up and release to fall down while constantly moving right). I suspect that the straightaways are designed as such that you can just listen to the narration and take in the environment without much thought as to where to jump or what pitfall to avoid. The problem is that these are too long. If you were to continue to walk right for the duration of the monologues, it would often conclude long before the next segment of gameplay. This is suboptimal design. Besides, the platforming sections are so infrequently strewn into the game with such embarrassingly shallow challenge that there would be no concern for distraction should the player encounter one during important exposition. The sliding sections are slopes that your character slips down without any control. The two mini-game types seem to be attempts at bolstering the gameplay, but they neglect that Spate's most enticing characteristic is not its gameplay. I will say, though, that the most fun parts of the game were the ""helicopter"" segments. My very minor complaints for this title are some collision glitches and an uneventful soundtrack that was just a smattering of sounds you might hear in any token thriller.The Pos --Eric Provan developed this game as a personal project and I am glad he did. Provan has worked for Disney's and Henson's animation studios, and he designed models and textures for such works as Frozen, The Amazing Spiderman, Alice in Wonderland, and Big Hero 6. His experience in 3D modelling provides Spate with its most powerful aspect: a haunting visual trek through a fantastically detailed world. The game is set in a steampunk era, and it plays well with the dark and mechanical environmental elements. The visual experience is unrivaled by most 2.5D side-scrollers; it develops a cerebral existence with themes symbolically integrated into the geography of the protagonist's world. While the story is not especially well-written, it does offer an emotional journey if the player wishes to be so engrossed. This is actually the most satisfying part of the game to me. The game very early informs you that you can take a swig of absinthe at any point during the game. The effect is shocking at first, the world twisting and distorting, backgrounds shifting into monstrosities. Having consumed the spirit, the player can move slightly faster and jump significantly higher. As is the case with absinthe, the player will encounter hallucinations on account of the drink which really embellishes the story in every good way. I will not ruin any plot elements in this review, but I will say that the entire game can be beaten without drinking absinthe, only some of the platforming sections are made stupidly simple if you are under the influence (due to the jump height advantage). I loved this intertwining of mechanic and story, since an alcohol addiction may make coping with pains significantly easier but it is never one's only option. A slighter pleasantry I should mention is the pacing of the game. It took 2 hours to play through, and I did not feel that any distinct section was drudgery, since the narration and visuals did mesmerize me quite well.The Verd --It may very well seem that I loathed this game, but its mistakes had much to do with the gameplay, which was not Spate's draw in the first place. Rather, thrilling atmosphere and striking animation are what this title offers most. I would have to dissuade those looking for a fun platformer from purchasing this game, but anyone who might be interested in a spectacle of mind games in service of a gloomy theme must experience Spate. For missing out on an opportunity to further immerse the player by melding more of the mechanics with the plot and for leaving the gameplay unattended, Spate garners a [7 / 10]. A dark theme terrifically employed into an uncertain world, Spate makes a great game for anyone willing to overlook its design flaws."

From the glowing reviews, I wanted to give this game a shot, especially considering the breathtaking design that the screenshots promised.The noir/steampunk design lended itself nicely to the plot, which is ripe with cliche dialogue that would make Max Payne's grimace transform into a prideful smile.  Although, I have to admit that the main voice actor in the game sounded very similar to Morgan Freeman.  Not that it's a bad thing.  Truly, the sin of the story is that it doesn't seem to go anywhere.  You can plop down the most surrealistic architecture, but if you have a plot that stands still, why am I even listening to the protagonist?If you're used to platformers, the gameplay is par for the course.  Jump on things that spin, dodge pits, dodge spikes, throw in a cannon or two.  Don't get me wrong, it's obvious that the developers put a ton of work into the game, but I still can't recommend the title, even at 50% off.To be honest with you, I haven't finished the game.  There was a respawn glitch that sends me to through the floor, straight into the kill barrier.  After shutting off to my desktop, returning to my save file, the glitch was still happening.  There's no excuse for this kind of game stopping glitch, which is a shame.There was a lot of potential for a truly special experience."

Either the gameplay needed to be better, or the story needed to be deeper. It raises plenty of questions without having the balls to answer them, and it provides some mild gameplay challenges without having the balls to truly challenge the player.As it is, the end product is unfocused, too clever by half, and I can't recommend it."

76561198052919524,Recommended,269810,10247456,"Posted: 26 May, 2014",all,BeatleNumber9,"Spate reminds me of so many things, from Limbo, to The Wicker Man, of all things. In Spate you play as a detective sent to an abandoned island to investigate the disappearance of a business man. Detective Bluth has a troubled past, as most detectives seem to have, involving his daughter disappearing, his wife leaving him, and having a drinking problem, which makes its way into the game as a surprising game mechanic.The first thing I noticed right away just by the game's screenshots is the game's style is gorgeous. They even say in the discription that they took influence from several artists such as Jim Henson and Dr. Seus. They way I could describe the overall style of the game is, Tim Burton remaking ""The Wicker Man"" with elements of Dr. Seus.The other cool mechanic of the game is the use of the main character's addiction. The game itself is a puzzle-platformer, like Limbo. And the reason the game looks so surreal is you don't know how much of the strangeness is real and how much of it is hallucinations from his addiction. And by drinking the alchohol during a puzzle it will make completing the puzzle easier. My only complaint about this that only a few puzzles actually needed to use the mechanic on. I like that it didn't force the mechanic on you, but the puzzles just seemed a little too easy, at least to me. I feel it could been a little bit harder to really make you sort of fight yourself not to use the alcohol. For the most part I just said ""Okay I'll try not to use it!"" and I didn't really have to try.The story also keeps you interested. The main character slowly feeds you what happened to him in his life and why he's become like this, and what's really going on, on this myserious island.The only other thing I have to complain about is the ending, or should I say endings. The game has two different endings. And while I liked them both, I feel like the way you get them could have been handled a lot better. I feel like what they should have done was one ending you get if you solved more puzzles without the need for the addictive substance, and the other ending you get if you rely on it too much.It's also surprisingly short, it only took me 99 minutes to complete on my first try. But to the game's credit I'm not sure how they really could have made it any longer without it feeling like they were dragging it out.Overall I liked Spate, it's a little flawed, but it's got a beautiful and interesting style, and a good story about overcoming loss and addiction. If you like games like Limbo, Braid, or Bastion, check this out."

As a great lover (perhaps even connosuier) of surrealism in non-static media such as films and video games (and static media too, mind, but those already get all the attention), I think I know a thing or too about seeing surrealist video games well done, and Spate is defintately a surrealist game well done.Spate is the story of an unflappable, self-loathing, absinth-addicted detective whose prone to blackouts and vivid hallucionations investigating a rich businessman who suddenly ran off without explanation into the surrealist, rain soaked, sunless wasteland of the Pearl Islands, known as the X-Zone (likely short for ""Exclusion Zone"") ever since everyone on them suddenly disappeared and the Islands turned into a surrealist, rain soaked, sunless wasteland.

There's cannons, jumping, and drinking your absinthe. It lacks interesting elements to keep a steady flow of attentiveness and enjoyment. There were some very interesting parts, such as entering through the first odd creature. As it went along I thought 'wow, i'm a little intimidated to go through this part/go inside this area. What'll happen if I do?' well, what happened was that I literally just walked through it, without any action or consequence. This game isn't terrible, don't get me wrong...But another problem with it, is that the controls are clunky. It feels like your character's slightly off in certain situations. There were a few times when I had a checkpoint and died. Not so hard, right? You get sent back to the checkpoint when you die-well, when you've went through a series of 6-8 obstacles and a narrow passageway just to slam right into the same upper wall the billionth time JUST because you didn't hold the space bar in just the right timing makes respawning very agonizing. There were very few other parts where I just sat there and said to myself 'I wonder if i'm going to get through this anytime soon.' because it was just so clunky and absurd. I go on a jump panel, and somehow I die....I jump towards a paltform, miss my jump, glitch in the segment holding up the platform and instantaneously die. The difficulty in this game is just aggravating. For the most part, it's easy sailing, you just work your way through, and to an extent it gets boring. Then, when you come to a more difficult part, that's not even that difficult in concept....You keep dying, or falling back to start, over and over and over again. It's not the fact that you die that makes it difficult; in fact, dying wasn't a concern...It's falling back right to where you started. It happens very solemn in this game, but when it does.....It's pretty aggravating. The narration is excellent, the story is very well done. If it's on sale and you just...Want to find a way to kill time, or if it looks interesting to you, go ahead and get it...But if I was recommending this to people who're looking for a triple A game, i'd tell them to pass on this."

Loved how you can just drink endlessly and the weird funny effects that it does on the game can really trip you for a loop! Beautiful game with quite a deep story even though it is short, and read the credits, some meaningfull stuff in there I wasn't expecting either, so take the time to read some of em....Game ran flawlessly for me with great mechanics. Ending was unique and just enough to walk away with a satisfied feel you finished the game. I hope there will be another game someday with perhaps more to it, doesn't matter if its a sequal or a whole new story/adventure. There isn't many games that are so simple, but yet, move me a little and this did that....

The unrecorded dialogue is also amateurish and silly.Your character, supposedly an alcoholic detective, looks and controls more like a rough draft of Octodad - and that actually provides most of the challenges given the unimaginative platforming involved.

If you're looking for a stroll through some pretty levels, I guess this game is a fine choice. That said, there are a number of problems:1.) Lack of PolishThere is a serious lack of polish on this game. In the first 36 minutes of play, I had already died from glitches twice and had to restart the game once because I mysteriously lost the ability to focus on a submenu, and could only control the main menu so the submenu was seemingly impossible to get rid of.The deaths were due to falling through the floor of a see-saw-like platform twice. This same see-saw sometimes seemed to pivot really fast if I stepped on it a certain way. If I stood on it while it descended, the character would hang in the air for a moment then fall repeatedly instead of riding down smoothly, causing him to do a weird sort of dance.At some point I was also shooting cannonballs into a basket to lift up a rock. I didn't realize at first how high I was supposed to lift it so I kept shooting cannonballs into this basket, which lifted the rock comically high above the pully that was supposed to be raising it.There's also barely any sound effects in the game. Buzzsaws swoop silently around you and kill you just as silently. The music volume on the other hand varies wildly, and I kept having to adjust my volume.And while the level design was fanstic, the character you play as seems to stick out awkwardly against hte world. He doesn't seem to quite fit the art style. This game simply doesn't seem to be finished.2.) Gameplay and PhysicsThe physics in this game are pretty awkward, and that really takes any kind of fun out of the dodging/jumping challenges you have to complete. The challenges themselves are pretty uninspired, and just don't really even seem to belong to the rest of the game. There is also a game mechanic where you can drink absinthe for apparently no reason other than making the screen wobbly. There is There's very little to gain from playing this game that you wouldn't gain by watching a playthrough of it.3.) Writing(Spoilers Below)While there are a few good lines, a significant portion of the monologue is reminding us over and over that the character drowns his sorrows with absinthe and that it makes him hallucinate. At the end of the game we also see the professor in the place of the bad guy for a few flahes in an apparent analogy between dependence on a machine and dependence on absinthe. I feel like the ""bad guy is you"" / ""journey of self improvement"" theme was pretty apparent long before we arrived at the end though. If there is anything subtle in this game, it was too sublte for me to catch it.The world and underlying plot are also not very well fleshed out. I understand that that may not be important in every game, but for a game where you play as a detective, the truths you uncover are pretty unsatisfying and feel very ad-hoc. The jokes are also not terribly funny.And I'm still clueless as to why our protagonist has a giant hand.(End Spoilers)It's not an ""awful"" game or anything, but pretty disappointing. I'd like to see the same artistic and musical talent in this game put into a more polished product in the future."

There were no puzzles, and very few obstacles to keep the gameplay interesting. So Idecided to focus on the other aspects...and was STILL dissapointed. Calling the game surreal is also a stretch. There was one moment about 45 minutes in where it got weird, and I was hoping that it would keep getting stranger. It didn't. Instead, that segment was over in about 5 minutes and it was back to boredom. The story was also really dissapointing. The narrator had a nice voice, but he sounded bored out of his mind.

I say that about any game where there's really something to be taken away from. I don't want to say that there's a certain quality to these games (there is an inexplicable lasting distinction between just a collaboration of controls and pixels) because then people will think all games that have that lasting appeal will always taste the same, even if that taste is delicious. What I'm trying to say is, there more to just platforming to SPATE.The control's a little floaty, and there isn't much flushing out of what's there, but it uses what it can do. Especially the drink. I went through multiple stages of alchohlism playing this.A variety of what you see doesn't make any sense, that there just ambiguosly talking about falling apart, darkness, madness, assuming we'll just eat it up; that isnt the case. Sure there's some random stuff and I can't retell every event in the game but I remember quite a bit. Moreover, I enjoyed it, even if I don't remember exactly what it was.The graphics and art-style are a bit wierd, you don't think you're playing with real people with Bluth's get-up but you adjust.The game can be a bit creepy, and I did put it down for a little bit; not saying much since I'm too spineless to be called an absolute horror game lightweight. It can be beaten in two hours or so, with not much replayablility, or other qualities good ""games"" (i. e. polished, marketed, well developed titles) nor does it have all the soul in all of fiction combined, but all amounts of soul are equal and worthwhile when not obscenely hindered by the core gameplay.

Its got it in spades! I'd go as far as to say that its a visual masterpiece, a true work of art.However, how does it hold up as a video game? Not very well I'm afraid. You see, I don't think the game really focuses on the ""fun"", making the typical game tropes of platforming, dodging traps, and such feel really out of place, not to mention that they are clunky, buggy and tedious. For me and my friend, these sections were pretty much there just to slow things  down and bore us, ironically, since we kept retrying due to poor controls and bugs.As for the story, well it was a bit too muddy and strange for me to remember it, frankly. Something about him losing his wife - you'll sometimes see mirages of her here and there. And theres mr. Random Robot. The only character you interact will just say completely random things, like ""I like the lights"", or such nonsense. Its not really funny and could not advance the plot in any relevent way, so I wonder if he was even necessary. Other than that, its all moody inner monologue.If there is one thing me and my friend found really cool in the game, its the singular game mechanic of distorting the world by drinking, via a controller button. Your character takes a sip, and not only does the world become all twisty, you can jump higher and further. You also see illusions here and there! I really enjoyed that.Unfortunatly, we had to close the game short at an hour and a half, as the game's depressing atmosphere was weighing too heavily on my friend (and me as well). I don't recommend this game for anyone with mental health issues. If you're cool with that kind of ambiance though, you'll definitely dig this.Its pretty clear what the game has to offer. It either fits your tastes or it does not, which would explain the mixed reviews. On a purely objective standpoint, I would say it is an experience unique enough to be worth a try, either way.I recommend getting it on sale.

76561198059877728,Recommended,269810,12026907,"Posted: 8 September, 2014",all,dejkbk,"Spate is a sidescrolling platformer spun from the mind of Eric Provan, an artist who had previously worked for the Jim Henson Company, Disney, and Sony Animation. You play as a depressed detective investigating the dissappearance of a rich business man in the ""X Zone"", a dreary, mysterious place that is plagued by endless rain and storms. Spate mixes the literal with the surreal to create a distinctive setting that is at once vivid and dream-like.The first and also lasting impression comes from the visuals of Spate, which look very much like something from a stop-motion animation. It is as if the player were looking in at a smaller world through a maginfying glass, only to find it filled with all manner of buildings and landscapes, crafted from wood, cloth, rocks and paint. Not only does the game have a striking style of art, but the actual design is also noteworthy, from a mountain made from a head made of hardened clay, to swerving, curving, striped pillars reminiscent of a Dr.Seus illustration. And all the time, the rain falls, the wind blows, rocks glistening and grass swaying beneath a relentless storm. The end result is the sense  of a dark dream, not a nightmare, but a somber, melancholic world colored by the perceptions of the detective the player plays as. The visuals are beautifully complimented by an atmospheric soundtrack that blurs in and out, a soundscape both musical and representational of the sounds of the world.The story is also an important part of the game, with the detective consistently narrating as the player journeys through the game's environments. The narration also reinforces the mood created by the visuals, of dark brooding and depression. We learn much of the detective, his past, his present and his attitude towards life, and especially of his addiction to drinking absyinthe and the effect this has on his mind. While the narration is effective, it doesn't quite match the stunning beauty of the visuals and audio of the game. I found the detective to sound a bit cliche and repititive. The story and the narration work, but they aren't the highlight of the game, which is unfortunate given that they are strongly focused upon.In terms of gameplay, Spate is a well-executed if not particularly original or challenging platformer. I would definitely recommend using a USB controller as the game plays much better with a D-pad, just like most other platformers. Spate utilizes many classic tropes of the platformer genre, from springs that let you jump higher to ropes that let you swing across holes. It is a physics-based game, which does set is somewhat apart, but by and large the game plays fairly similarly to something like Donkey Kong Country. For someone experienced with the platformer genre, the game is not particularly difficult, yet is nonetheless well-designed and enjoyable. It is perhaps a particularly good game for those approaching the platformer genre for the first time, as it introduces many typical ideas of the genre without assuming the player has already mastered the basic elements of the genre.Spate is a wonderous game if only for it`s exemplary visual and audio aesthetics. The story is decent, and the gameplay is fun, but it`s the setting and the presentation of that setting that really take your breath away. Never before have I played a game so willing to embrace surrealistic aesthetics, and with such a captivating art style. The game is rather short (I beat it in a few hours) but this is a case of quality over quantity. If you like an experimental aesthetic approach in videogames, this is definitely a game to try out. If you're looking to get acquainted with the sidescrolling platformer genre, this is also a pretty great pick. If you don't like experiemental aesthetics, or are looking for a long game with lots of challenge, this game isn't for you."

I had high expectations regarding the story and visuals for this game.  The artstyle and the warping of the environment from the ""drinking absinthe"" mechanic lived up to my expectations;  It was truly a beautiful visual experience.  The music was also very fitting.Unfortunately, every other aspect of the game was lacking.  The platforming was not challenging and boring (not to mention half the game was spent just walking), the story was very cliche and redundantly paraphrased throughout the game, and aside from looking beautiful the level design was mediocre.  If as much effort was put into these game elements as was put into the visuals, Spate may have been one of my favourite Indie games of 2014.Spate had so much potential as a game, but the final result makes me feel the game should have just been a short film instead.  The game even has 2 possible endings, but in order to see both you are required the play through the ENTIRE game once again (repeating all the boring game elements).  I suggest others avoid buying this game, and at the very least just watching a Let's Play on youtube."

Come to think of it there is not much story to begin with. Narration seems to be the center of the game, walking you through depressing wanderings of a drunk, with absolutely no substance to them at all. Little inklings of a story fed to you here and there are never really expanded on just mentioned before the main character reminds you of his melancholy.Platforming aspect is as boring as I have ever seen. More often than not you are just mindlessly going forward and jumping with no challenge at all. Logic puzzles are virtually non existant. If you are looking at this game for its platforming qualities, I assure you there are none.The only quality here is the artistic background which will briefly break you out of the boredom that this game brings, but not for long. Maybe worth going through it once for that reason, at a grand total of just under an hour to finish the game. Nah, it is not.Fail 2/10"

The nature of the game, and the overall story is really surreal, and distorted. Spate is a side scrolling story telling game where you pretty much do nothing except scroll to the side and listen to the history of the character you play.I was really impressed by Spate. The story is outstanding, the voice acting deserves an award, and the visuals altogether are brilliant.Even though this game only lasted 2 hours I can honestly say this was an experience like no other. I was fascinated by this game. It's not usually a game I would buy, but this has made me consider buying more side scrolling story telling games.Spate tells the story of an alcoholic detective who cannot get over the loss of his daughter, and collapse of his marriage. When he gets a contract to look for a missing business man on the same Island his daughter went missing the story begins to unravel...This game leaves you with two endings.

It is surreal, strangely enveloping and brings all the colors and illusions you always wanted to experience for yourself unless you can't get rid of them. Combine with slow-to-come platforming were, apparently, alcohol makes you faster and jump higher, you get truly awe-inducing game. Not to mention the art style and visuals - I often felt as if Machinarium had married The City of Lost Children along with bits from Fantastic Mr. Fox' 2.5D perspective.Thus, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's perfect for those times when you feel like there's nothing in life but numbing away from your pain.

The narative is kind of fun to watch as it plays out alabiet it feels a bit flat. It's short but each level seems like it's drawn out longer. There are some interesting platforming sections, but some of the jumps outside of those sections feel like they're there to engage the player. In some sections it feels like there are some moments that are really able to draw you in, but others just kind of remind me that I'm playing a game. The main character feels resonably fleshed out, but it's as if there missing sections that I can't understand. There are creative monsters that give you a conversation, but never apear again. At the end of the day this is a fun game that is worth a look see because of the price. There seems like there could be multiple endings outside of a mere choice but I'll update if thats the case."
