It stops working whenever I click anywhere on my second or main monitor while on a loading screen, or generally crashes very frequently when loading, navigating through menus, or when the game is out of focus, making multitasking very hard.It even sometimes randomly crashes in-flight, which ruins the entire flight.-Some minor annoying bugs (map glitching out, strange haze in the evening, lighting bugsespecially at sunrise and dawn, ground vibrating, but nothing totally game breaking)-Some very ugly sounds, e.g. the skid sound when turning or braking makes my ears bleed,default aircraft sounds are OK, not too bad but also not groundbreaking-steam overlay and screenshots do not work by default-poor default ATC ( I recommend 124thatc plugin, much better)-no crash log, so no way to find out which plugin crashes your gameIn my opinion already the new best flight simulator on the market right now, I have played FSX for a long time, but it's just getting too old and clunky.X-Plane 11's graphics looks absolutely astonishing on high settings with some addons like skymaxx pro and blufx, and there are very helpful tutorials in-game or on youtube for beginners.Some addons I would recommend getting:-ortho4xp for photorealistic scenery-Xenviro / skymaxx pro (I prefer skymaxx)-x-Life (the free version)-Ground handling deluxe (very immersive payware)-124thatc (best ATC so far)-XPuipc and Plan-G (for flight planning)-and of course FlyWithLua.Also a tip for you screenshot-lovers, by installing reshade 3.0.4, the steam overlay and screenshots gets enabled again, HOWEVER moving windows like the map to another monitor by making it a new window does not work anymore then, which is very unfortunate, since I own 2 monitors and really love that function."

My first impressions have been excellent thus far. Setup and usage is much more intuitive than 10 was. I especially like the joystick setup now which included a visual representation of my Saitek X52. Setup was very easy and I was flyimg with the default aircraft in no time. The 737 and MD80 included aircraft are very well modeled and surprisingly detailed. Weather has been improved and clouds and visibilty look very realistic. Flying through clouds now is very impressive. The user interface is a welcome change and easy and intuitive to use. Frame rates for me are great, and I am very pleased with the overall look and performance of the sim. I'm sure there are bugs and issues yet to be found, but I am confident LR will deal with them. This by far the best flight sim available, and very much worth the upgrade."

,Recommended,269950,33375780,Posted: 8 July,all,🐉 Ðŗąçø 🐉,"Click here to view sone of my best screenshotsHaving spent more than 350 hours flying the flag for X-Plane 11 and offering too much support in the Steam forums, I thought now would be a good time to review X-Plane 11, and explain why it beats all other flight simulators.Let's start with what's in the box. You're getting a mixture of very high-quality general aviation aircraft, some good airliners and some other aircraft, such as a helicopter, glider and military aircraft. Some of these are brilliant, some need more work. But the default aircraft are good enough for any aspiring flight simmer.The default weather is, as usual, not good. The clouds, rain and other effects don't do justice sadly, but developers are slowly moving from FSX to X-Plane, and soon we'll have the best weather plugins for X-Plane 11. That said, the new haze and fog effects, lighting, reflections and cloud shadows are really good for a default version of a simulator.X-Plane 11 has been 64-bit the longest of any sim, and the devs themselves are years ahead of their competitors. Take P3D and FSW for example. Both are now 64-bit in 2017, whereas X-Plane has been 64-bit since 2014-2015. And it will only get better - X-Plane is moving to the Vulkan engine soon. This means not just one CPU core, but your entire CPU will be able to deliver exceptional frame rates for such a great sim. You'll also be able to SLI/Crossfire your GPUs too.The X-Plane community is also some of the best you'll ever come across. The official forums, although now slow and a nightmare to navigate, are fuelled with both newbies and old-timers, real pilots and developers. I think the price of the sim means younger, less intelligent people are less likely to buy this sim, so you'll only come across the more professional flight simmers in X-Plane.Additionally, the forums are PACKED with freeware. Freeware to enhance the weather and skies, some excellent payware-quality airports and aircraft, plenty of plugins and an array of other stuff that means a £1000-equivalent copy of FSX might only set you back less than £100 in X-Plane 11. This is a huge advantage - no other sim has a bigger freeware:payware ratio than X-Plane.Moreover, X-Plane has been developed by devs who will actually listen to you. Drop them an email, they'll read it. Comment on their developer posts - they'll listen. Austin Meyer - creator of X-Plane - is still developing the sim over 20 years on, and there is so much more to look forward to. Future updates of X-Plane 11 look extremely promising, and I for one, cannot wait to see what the team has to offer.So why is X-Plane 11 better than its competitors? Well...Flight Sim World (FSW) is too new to even think about, and to be quite frankly honest with you, should be the last sim that you should choose.Flight Simulator X (FSX) is the most successful simulator ever... Sorry, WAS the most successful. The fact is, FSX is slowly hitting retirement age, and requires a lot of plugins and payware to look good.P3D is not for casual simming, so you have to be a trainee pilot or developer to play this.All three of the sims mentioned above rely on old Microsoft code that cannot be changed, but X-Plane is built on its own code. As a result, X-Plane will slowly pull away from these sims, and may rise to become the greatest of them all.Still have questions? Please don't be afraid to PM me!"

It just needs a bit more content. Suggestions:1: Career mode, like start in a cheap plane and ferry people wherever they want to go and eventually upgrade. Give me an incentive to grind flight hours and visit places I wouldn't normally think of.2: More tutorials. Teach us more about all the instruments. Go through taking-off and landing the various planes. Preferably in interesting locations.3: More missions.4: Steam Workshop support.It has a few bugs at present, which I won't detail here, but nothing game-breaking - I've not had any crashes yet. Also, I find it inconvenient to have to go to external websites to properly plan flights. It needs the ability to see the whole world in the map screen, and also have it accessible from the main menu."

A flight simulator that is actually good enough to replace the ever so old FSX!Pros:- Finally some graphics, the game looks greate out of the box.

( i was surprised compared to default FSX aircraft)- good flight modeling (feels more realistic then FSX in my opinion)-X-plane.orgcommunity, where there is loads of free Stuff created by other users (scenery, plugins, skins, aircraft etc)- XP Plane Maker to create you own aircraft (have not tried it yet, but that you can create your own plane is a cool feature in my opinion)- WED (World editor) where you can create your own airports or upgrade deafult airports. (i have done 2 airports so far, and i must say if you follow some tutoials you can create very nice airports)- Good functioning flight Replay and Record function.Cons:- most default airports look very basic. (can be easely fixed for many airports by downloading user created airports)- At this point in time there are not so many payware or freeware aircraft availeble- default ATC is not very good (can be easely fixed with freeware or payware plugins)- no flight planning tool in the game."
76561197966985448,Recommended,269950,30856245,Posted: 31 March,all,PigGI,"All I can say that X-Plane 11 is awesome. I have own every Flight Simulator since 1977 from Sublogic, Microsoft and Prepar3d. I have never purchased X-Plane in the past since I found it was too much work to set-up. Now with X-Plane 11 it's just simple. The standard sceneries are so detailed that there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars for scenery add ons. The aircrafts that also come with the package are very well detailed. If you’re not convinced, just watch YouTube; there you will find multitude of information on many topics from flying to scenery modifications. I run X-Plane 11 in 4k resolution without experiencing any bad frame rate, lag or out of memory problems. For those who are having flying issues, check your hardware and remember this is a simulation not a game. I am very pleased with X-Plane 11 and now I am looking forward for 3rd party software developers to create aircrafts etc. Happy flying."

76561198309712566,Recommended,269950,31853450,Posted: 19 May,all,BigKangaroo3,"After flying in X-Plane 11 for almost 50 hours I thought it time to share some thoughts on the sim.I was Initially very disappointed - there were no airport buildings in Australia! Did I not install something? The buildings in the Demo made it look fantastic!After talking with one of the Devs online he pointed me tohttp://forums.x-plane.org/where I was able to download the Sydney and Melbourne terminals. The Melbourne terminal and surrounding area was pretty close visually to the FSX ORBX terminal, at no cost - Nice one!Next, I had to find a decent ATC. The default ATC is very sub standard and needs a lot of work. It was telling me to fly at 5000, no, 6000, no 5000....in the space of a few seconds.Just as well there were no other aircraft in the air (another gripe I have, why is there is no other airline traffic in the air??) as it may have gotten messy over Sydney airport.... So after spending some more time looking throughx-plane.orgi found the ATC plugin (124thATC64) which improved flying considerably and made it seem like a different game.A WD40 plugin needs to be made to grease the front wheels of the default planes. They screech when turning on the taxi ways. Once again, it was back to Google andhttp://forums.x-plane.org/to find out what was going on. Apparently this has been occurring for a few years. WTF?? After installing the 737-800 from EADT(http://www.eadt.eu/index.php?new-x737-version-5)the screeching stopped. Perhaps the X-plane Devs need to contact EADT and ask them how they did that...?So, is X-plane 11 all bad? No, far from it. What they have got right is the flight model. It 'feels' better flying a 737-800 and Cessna manually in X-plane than FSX, even PMDG's 737-800. The 64-bit code means I never get any Out of Memory issues like I did using PMDG, ORBX, REX and Active Sky Next in FSX's 32-bit game. The default X-plane 11 scenery at 15,000 feet plus looks just as good as the ORBX paid scenery and default weather system and skys are also very good. The lighting in X-Plane 11 at night beats FSX 'hands down' no matter what mod you are using.So X-plane 11 has some very good features that show a definite improvement over the default and modified FSX in some areas. In it's current state however it still feels like a Beta. I understand the X-Plane Devs are a small team and rely heavily on the community to help out creating airports, planes and utilities which certainly improves playability.It's a pity they haven't considered community funding like Star Citizen etc to raise funds for additional coders and business people to work with ORBX, Active Sky Next and REX to add further realism and polish to the game. Addons like FsPassengersX for FSX and Prepar3D would also improve playability and enjoyment and reach a greater player market.There are some brilliant aspects to this flight sim that will make you appreciate buying it, however, it still needs some work at  the basic levels to make it feel more than a Beta. I recommend it to those people understanding you will need to download lots of additional addons to make it feel 'complete'."

76561197971984146,Recommended,269950,31497294,Posted: 1 May,all,ziporama,"XP11 is by far the best desktop flight simulator I've had.  I'm an FSX veteran and was never attracted to XP because it was simply not as good as FSX with all the add-ons.I tried XP11 as a demo and I was very impressed with what comes in the box - the resolution of the terrain - the defaul scenery quality - the basic aircraft included.  I was more impressed by the open API to make the product better, and the progress this title has made in the last decade.    While I deeply mourn what happened to the Microsoft team, I think the XP team gets that and picked up right the spirit of desktop flight sim and did something nothing short of great with XP11.The good:- high detail in the box- good flight model and physics- no flat runways!- highly extensible model with a growing community supporting XP (even high end payware aircraft makers like PMDG are getting on the XP train)- excellent input controller support in the box including things like TrackIR- open API for extensibility- good built in aircraft and base ""GPS"" modules - very high quality and fidelity - good for learning procedures and IFR- good support by the community and online flying- highly engaged dev team - and one that understands how to make flight simThe mediocre:- very few add-ons compared to what you'll find on the MIcrosoft side of things - even now with a defunct product - XP has a lot ot catch up to do there.  Not XP's fault but high quality / high fidelity content is only trickling in (example, new PMDG DC6 for XPlane)- default airports are ho-hum for much of the US, including some glaring errors, but main airports (big cities) are notches above anything else I've ever seen in the boxThe bad:- very much CPU bound - getting it to use more than 1.5 cores is a challenge - which hogs frame rates.  GPU will spent its time waiting for CPU so be prepared for oh-hum FPS in highly complex areas (KEAS, NYC).   Throwing in a better GPU will not do much except lower your GPU utilization.  Not sure what the deal is but in this day and age of multi-core CPUs now that IPC (instruction per second) have basically plateaued per core makes this title very CPU bound, and very single core CPU bound regardless of settings.  Add AI traffic and complex scenery and your sim is more like a slideshow - even on very high end hardware - by this I mean 20FP to 25FPS.   So ok, but not a sim able to use all your processing hardware.- The steam version doesn't get you access to regular beta updates put out by Laminar research - so mind you'll only get the ""better"" betas to try out.   Forums abound with people who say how great the betas are - a total excercise in frustration on my end because I don't get access to those, and I like to test.  I wish I knew that before making that decision as I assumed that all distribution points would be created equal."
76561198004584311,Recommended,269950,34390027,Posted: 21 August,all,Luftwaffles794,"Having run FSX and X-Plane 10 side by side for years, each offering's strengths and weaknesses come up rather glaringly though as time (and money) goes on, differences become too small to notice. Whether its the crude ATC, inconsistent default airport buildings, or the graphics itself, at the end of the day for serious flight sim enthusiasts and real pilots such as myself, we all come down to a small number of things that make or break a simulation. The one thing that X-plane 11 really hits the nail on the head here is truly the physical aspect of flying. In X-Plane, aircraft do not seem to be ""on rails"" even on the ground. Runways follow the terrain's contours, and in hard weather, a pilot would feel the need to make corrections to keep the aircraft from rolling over or going off the straight. Crosswind landings are even more challenging as unpredictable gusts of wind blows you around in ways that would make you use your controls' full range of motion.At the heart of this game is a tool for pilots or would be pilots who plan on honing their skill or practice difficult scenarios. At times the base simulator can feel rather barren and the ATC either annoying or worryingly homicidal, two of X-Plane's most glaring weaknesses for as long as players' can remember. However these do not take away much if you are jumping in with an intent to study. X-Plane is as much a training aid than it is a hobbyist's plaything. At defaults, a newcomer hailing from FSX might find the pilot fantasy experience to be lacking. But it all disappears the moment an errant gust of wind or jetwash pushes you off and forces you to deal with what feels like a plane that is truly flying in the skies.I would recommend this game to anyone looking for an aid in their pursuit to getting their license or to anyone who ismore interested in getting the feel for flying rather than the fantasy of it. This is a simulation that goes out of its way to give its players the power and the flexibility to practice whatever it is they want to do and analyze their performance in the face of what must be the closest representation of flight dynamics out there at the moment. This is a must buy for serious enthusiasts and pilots alike."
76561198060441632,Recommended,269950,30987045,Posted: 6 April,all,SumariSong,"Comparing to FSX to Xplane:Ive been with FSX forever. Always thought xplane was a cheap knock off. Download the demo and find out how you feel about it yourself, but as for me ive noticed the following immedietely. (This is with my computer, Some people are having technical difficulties, mine runs perfectly.)Pros of XPLANE:-first off its new! FSX isnt, fsx is 32 bit, Xplane is 64.  We can update the scenery and textures of fsx and spend a lot of money, but off the shelf xplane has better graphics by far even with some payware addons.-Much smoother flight control. MUCH smoother. At first it felt a little bit more ""arcade"" like. And i still feel this way, but its much easier to fly. I dont know which is more ""realistic"". Ive only got 3 hours of real flight time in a real plane, and xplane is much quicker to respond compared to fsx, id oscilate sometimes trying to land a plane in fsx, i dont have that problem in Xplane, and i didnt in real life..... so theres that, if thats worth anything. and actually that was the key selling point after playing the demo repeatedly for several hours.-Default planes are more complex than any default FSX plane. ESPECIALLY airliners omg.... the 737 is about 60% of the pmdg 737 in FSX, which says A LOT as its a default plane.-Runways arent always flat... and xplane accurately represents that, a small, but neat feature.-Did i mention graphics? on my i7 2015 model gaming laptop, i was impressed-There are actual cars on the roads! the night lighting is spectacular! Cars on the highways at night!? holy cow what a concept. This may not be new, but it is to me coming from fsx. it seriously makes the scenery come to life.-very easy to get started. It just feels newer and modern.CONS of Xplane:- Do tires always smoke when you're taking off or taxiing? or is that an xplane thing?- and airliners leave a black contrail behind them appearantly, it looks like an asteroid coming in from outer space more than a plane lol....-Not many default planes. but a good solid basic lineup-im seriously having to think hard here about this cons list.... navigating the menus is different and takes some getting used to...- Not much payware out yet?... Nothing im really willing to commit to yet at least....Ultimately the only thing i like better about FSX vs Xplane.- Fsx is what im familiar with, and im a pmdg pilot. The fact that pmdg hasnt put anything out besides an old dc for xplane makes me wonder a bit. The pmdg models were the best thing that ever happend to fsx. The complexity and realism of the their latest 747 and 737 models are nothing that anyone anywhere yet has come close to yet... I guess what im realizing just now is that, my favorite part about FSX isnt even fsx itself hahaha.... oh man if that doesnt spell it out for you i dont know what will... Ill be playing my 737 and 747 flight simulators still (and by that i mean my pmdg planes, because they are simulators themselves, legitimately they are a running simulator within a simulator), but everything else will be xplane for sure."

This might seem premature for a reivew, but after a short flight in Seattle I'm sold.I've flown most flight sims since the mid eighties and boy have they come a long way.This is the first sim I have flown where you feel like you are flying through air, rather than a vacuum. In addition, the hazing effects are superb. Very realistic and once again add to the feeling of flying in air.I have a pretty beefy system, which sims like Prepar3d normally brings to its knees. But here, at 4k resoution with everything except AA maxed out, it runs liquid smooth - something that's simply impossible in Prepar. The liquid smoothness and density of the terrain really add to the illusion of being there.Even with default scenery and the default aircraft this sim looks superb. I can't wait to tinker with Ortho4XP scenery, nor can I wait to see what the third party publishers give us.Prepar and FSX have had a good run, but finally, they have been surppased in every way. After I finish this review, I will be uninstalling Prepar3d as it is not even in the same ball park with regard to flight fidelity, looks and performance. Farewell Prepar and hello X-Plane! :D"

The sim also runs exceptionally well, running very comfortably at medium settings and no antialiasing on my kinda outdated PC. The cockpit detailing is far superior to any I've ever seen before, especially in the 737 (but the inability to test the GPWS annoys me slightly haha), but from what I've seen in the 737, 747 and Cessna Skyhawk it looks perfect.The bad stuffThe built in ATC is pretty bad. The default ATC in FSX just seems to work better, and also has a lot more functionality (I can't seem to be able to even request a change of flight level, and if I do change without the permission of ATC, it will repeatedly tell me to descend/ascend to my previous flight level and refuse to stop until I comply).Apart from this minor issue, I can't find anything else I dislike about XP11. It's just fantastic compared to FSX."

The visuals are pleasing to the eye, and the flight dynamics are enjoyable. I can also say the sound is great. But of course there are some good and some bad which will be explained below.Pros:-Beautiful graphics- Great physics- Fantastic sound- (Most) fully usable cockpits- Wonderful UI- Ground services is an added bonus to the realism- Overall realistic experience- Departue wizard makes taxiing properly easy for anyone- Auto tuning frequencies within ATC is niceCons:- Poorly optimized (this is supposed to change with the new graphics engine coming out)- Cirrus Vision SF50 is not complete (Subject to change with an update per Developers)- Due to the optimization requires a beast of a computer to get it smooth without a bunch of tweaking graphics- ATC is kind of broken, and you will see that often in many reviews (Update will fix it per the Developers)- Clouds look funky despite the rest being crafted so well- Current lack of Payware aircraft (Subject to change with some more time after release)Overall, I find X Plane 11 enjoyable as I was not a fan of X Plane 9 or 10, mostly due to the horrible UI they used to flaunt and the lack of multiplayer. As their site says though ""More powerful. More usable."" it is an overhaul of previous editions for sure. I have owned and played FSX since its release in 2008, I also own DCS 1 and 2, IL2 (most of the series), Flight Sim World, and Flight School (I skipped Microsoft Flight because it was horrible). I also played Flight SImulator 2004: Century of Flight, and CFS2 and 3. I have a fair amount of experience in Flight Sims and I will say this is like DCS level of detail mixed with the ease of flying in FSX. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do, and happy flying."

Out-of-the-box X-Plane blows FSX away. It also performs pretty solidly on my ""mid-range"" PC (i7, 16GB, GTX960 2GB).  On FSX whereas I'd often drop <15 fps in heavily rendered areas, X-Plane stays consistently at/above 30fps.  When I replaced my GTX960 with a 1070, I'm now hitting 50-55fps with almost max settings. Butter smooth!The flight model itself does seem more realistic (Who am I to judge having never flown a real plan :) ). The built-in planes are decent... a step-above the stock FSX planes, but probably not quite as good as early Alabeo/Carenado.  I will miss the study-level Q400 and A2A Cessna, but hopefully we'll see more study-level planes in X-Plane soon.  The community offerings aren't as robust as FSX (they do have a 10 year head-start) but there is some really good stuff as freeware are pretty reasonably-priced payware.If I have a criticism, its the completely inadequate ATC.  It doesn't seem to follow airport operating procedures for light aircraft, and gives me some really weird routings. Stock FSX ATC and flight-planning was better, and there were some brilliant add-ons like VoxATC.  Hope to see an XP port soon!With robust sales of this product, I imagine we'll see a strong upswing in conversion of existing products/add-ons for X-Plane,"

This is not really a game, but a world-wide highly detailed flight model. If you are brand-new to flight sims, this product is extreamly daunting, and quite (no, VERY) complex to get your head around. Yes, if you just want to apply full power and get airbourne you can, but then you are missing out on 90% of the sim's potential. Learning how to fly properly, start planes, programme your flights plans from cold and dark and navigate your way to far away places and actually find the runway to land is most of the fun... but do not under estimate how much learning that will take!There is a highly active 3rd party developer community who have developed some truely remarkable scenary, mods, planes and sounds much of which is free, or moderatly priced. Master this simulator and you will not just loose hours, days or weeks of your life in the virtual world - you will loose decades!Highly recommend investing in a decent flight Yoke/Rudder peddels and get yourself airborneNote: The software is regulary patched and updated and does require a substantial beefy PC to get the most out of it. We're talking here top spec gaming rigs to have all the bells and whistles on but boy oh boy, is it worth it.Update: 16-Apr. I've now been flying for quite a few hours and been tinkering with the settings to get the most out of it. My PC Maxiumus IX moterboard, I7-7700k 4.2 Ghtz, overclocked to 5.0 Ghtz with a Asus Strix 1080Ti Gfx. I pretty much have everything clicked up to the Max (except reflections I don't like the effect) and I get between 25-45 frames per second (most 35+) depending on the complexity of the Scene. (New York in foggy conditions at 25fps is still very playable). Now I appriciate that is a fairly beefly PC, but with tinkering you'll still be able to get very good results on a lower spec machine.I'm blown away by how good the gfx are out of the box, especially at dusk/dawn, but some of the textures do look a little week especially at low level flying, however I'm now just beginning to look into the community work, purchasing some extra custom scenery and it's fanstastic. Some free, some is payware... Ortho4XP looks an interesting tool that allows you to use realy google map pictures of the landscape and import them in to the game. (Free!)I also flew from Bristol International, along the M4 and north on the A419 to locate my house yesterday - Highly amusing!"

Most airports have now buildings and look realistic, at least for the europe scenery included with the steam version (have not flown outside europe for now). AI traffic control seems to improved and is now able to hit the glide scope for runways correctly, though there are still some AI glitches (e.g., AI tower granted takeof clearance to a plane while I was doing the final approach on the same runway.)I still like the idea that navaids etc. are stored as simple ascii files that easily can be edited with notepad.There are also some nice usability features, e.g. loading the nav settings from the map directly to navigation system.Would buy again."

They are poppy, loopy with clicks in them and the tires skid all the time for no reason. Sounds more like the sound loops in an old Windows 95 game.2) Landmarks are not where they should be. In Prepar3d or FSX they are. This should be fundamental to a flight simulator so sim pilots can fly VFR. Not sure what they were thinking.3) If you think ATC in FSX or Prepar3d is bad, buckle up. This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. It uses only a couple of different voices, it's nearly impossible to tell who is talking to who, and you are given incorrect or bizarre guidance through the flight.

Many things have changed from XP10 but the base mechanic of a hyper-realistic flight simulator still resonates. Some people may find a lack of aircraft, but there are many websites that you can get payware and freeware aircraft, airports, scenery and much more. (my personal favorite iswww.x-plane.org)As far as the performance goes, its rather mediocre. I run at near max settings getting a steady 25-30 fps, although I do have a bunch of extra scenery files installed which may be the cause of the low frame rate. Running some of the plugins also tends to reduce performance, esspecialy if those are ""legacy"" plugins designed to run on older versions and not optimized for XP11, and the same goes for aircraft.The gameplay is truely unique (excluding the AI planes doing whatever they do best). Being able to file a real flight plan complete with airways and navaids is something I have never done before XP11. You don't necessaraly need the navaids when you file your flight plan, but they help you get places accuratly but i recomend downloading flight charts from the FAA if you're actually going to file a flight plan with navaids as the ingame map has been signifcantly reduced in size from previous versions.The unique part of X-Plane is that it is easy and practically made to mod and customize to your heart's content. With an included plane and airfoil maker, you can design your own planes from scratch. You can download custom scenery files and install it super simple, by putting it in the ""Custom Scenery"" folder.Overall I feel the Laminar Research has outdone themselves again and I look foward to whats next in X-Plane"

First off, the flight realism is the most accurate it has ever been in X-plane. These are not Xbox-ready military simulators with overdone graphics but more of a traditional flight simulation. If you were expecting Ace Combat, go buy Ace Combat. Though combat can be done on here, it is not too terribly fun. I will now offer my pros and cons:PRO>More realistic flight physics>Easier startup interface>Much improved ATC interface>Maps are now accurate to flight maps>Local graphics so accurate I can tell where I actually am in relation to real airports I've flown to, from, or out of when I was flying. If not, the custom scenery from their site is still backwards compatable.CON>No backwards compatability with aircraft (Pain in the rear to update too due to new GPS system)>No emergency options with ATC (My right engine fell off, can I have vectors? No? ♥♥♥♥♥...)>Stock sounds don't change volume with throttle and suck in their current state.>Must wait for updates to get the most out of this (remeber when games came out ""complete""?)>Stock aircraft are bland and as of right now there isn't many aircraft on the site yet for V.11.Overall, I'm glad I bought it.

Most cities are autogen, and CBDs are ""plausible"" based on OpenStreetMap data, and the road layouts are pretty amazing, but I couldn't actually find a built-in landmark besides the Space Needle in Seattle. Mods are king, and the good mods are pretty pricey -- and some of them are _very_ punishing for the GPU.- Seasons are also out the window. Everything's in a state of perpetual late Spring/early Fall unless you get mods. There are a few good free ones for this, though, and they don't kill your GPU.- The built-in ATC system's pretty lacking. Again, though, there are mods for this, free and paid.Having said that, the detailed terrain, amazing lighting, and realistic weather and flight models are IMO plenty to offset those problem areas.

The tutorials are excellent and great for newcomers to the flight sim world. There's not very many dlc's available for version 11 yet, usually more aircraft and airport add-ons will be released over time. Although the base game is much more expensive than Microsoft's FSX, you won't be spending as much money on dlc's to improve various aspects of the game. The graphics are already fantastic, and much better than FSX (unless you buy all of the environmental add-ons, which will easily cost you hundreds of pounds;   and unless you have a state of the art computer,  you won't be able to run most of those add-ons together). For me FSX (now developed by Dovetail games) has become far too money grabbing with over £2.7K worth of dlc;  much like their Train Simulator (which has over £4K worth of dlc). Not to say X-Plane is that cheap. If you check out the earlier version 10, there's over £800 worth of dlc's for that game and the dlc for v11 is starting to mount up (almost £300).Still, I've thourougly enjoyed the little time I've already spent crashing planes in X-Plane 11. Although I've been playing flight sims since F1 was released almost 30 years ago, I still consider myself a novice when it comes to flying. X-Plane has tried to make the experience as realistic as possible, which is why my first attempts at flying ended up with me nose down in the asphalt or spiraling out of control into the sea;  but with a little patience I soon was able to keep my aircraft in the air and level  and at that point  started to really enjoy the fantastic scenery that comes free with all X-Plane games (unlike with FSX).I highly recommend buying this especially if you like flight sims. Even at full price (almost £55) it's a bargain and I guarantee you'll have hundreds of hours of enjoyment trying the various aircraft out that include light aircraft, small passenger planes, commercial airlines and fighter planes as well as helicopters. There's a wide range of airports available covering all types from farm landing strips to international airports.I'll update this when i've had more time in game. Just wanted to post my first impressions today.The game  takes up over 50GB of HD space."

Weather and lighting is so realistic I would defiantly give it 10/10 in this department.PerformanceReason for giving the simulator a poor rating is due to the fact that the default aircrafts are not completely finished. No FMC and poor performance, I really wish they would of improved these prior X-Planes release. The wheels screetch, again no FMC. Performance of the aircraft isn't as good as FSX PMDG aircraft in my personal opinion.When I say ""performance"" I am refering to the movement of the aircraft such as the speed, landing, take off. It does not simulate the G's, knots when taking off making it feel really unrealistic when taking off and landing which to me is a VERY important thing. FSX EZCA addon can simulate this so indeed it is a third party addon BUT for the price I would of expected a better system.SoundSound is good and tolerable 6/10 however the ATC is awful. If there could be some kind of programme where users can implement their own voices or downloaded voice backs this would also take a work load off the developers/programmers.In result of so many cons in this game I did ask for a refund to a later date where X-Plane was a further developed but unfortantly I had played more than 2 hours (trying to set everything up and fix the screetching).Airports and LiveryLivery is amazing, the fact they have removed the flat 2D look by using 3D X64 terrain is the best thing they have done so far, shockwave lighting etc... It beats FSX and P3D even with addon software. Airports do however let X-Plane down.REMEMBER that the demo is exactly what you get inside the game, I thought you would of got more but you don't so if you dont like the demo you won't like the game.Thanks."

,Recommended,269950,35457343,Posted: 3 October,all,FinalCoyote,"Listen, this sim is a serious investment. It's not easy to justify dropping £54.99 / 62 EUR / $72 on a game, but this isn't really a game. It's a full-on, commercial-grade flight simulator and one that will either make or break your commitment to learning curves.If you do any flying, this sim is the only one worth getting. It accurately simulates flight dynamics based on real-time flight modelling; it's as realistic as you're going to get. Paired with the correct hardware and licences, it allows pilots to log hours towards ratings. So, for the best part of £60, you'll get as close to flying as you can in your home.For someone who doesn't fly, this game presents a significant challenge. There are some basic tutorials which explain the fundamentals of flying in a Cessna 172 - after that, you're absolutely on your own. There's a few aircraft to choose from, from small GA planes like the Cessna all the way to four-engine passenger jets from Boeing. Systems are accurately modelled and interactable - you really can control everything just as you would in the real machine. So, once you've mastered some simple pootling about in your 172, you can escalate to small jets or 747s and find a whole new level of challenge. It's the only game where I've had to consult actual reference material outside the game, and when I found myself reading a flight manual in my idle time, I realised I was either very sad and or probably justifying my purchase price. It's an immersive world, and if you've got the time and the brainspace, it's rewarding too.XP11 is endlessly expansible too; the default install package includes the WHOLE world's terrain and is impressively accurate, but with the help of mainly freeware mods online, you can accurately simulate your hometown if you so wish. There's a raft of extra aircraft (including some payware which rivals the base game price) which are unbelievably well-concieved - the community go the extra mile here to faithfully recreate their favourite airliners.A small mention has to go to the visuals - it's a stunning engine and some of the 3D cockpits are so immersive it's easy to forget you're sitting in front of a monitor. Engaging, stimulating and satisfyingly accurate, Laminar Research have continued to impress with XP11 - but it's not a light purchase. There's a good demo, if you fancy it - and for the love of god, play with some sort of controller, it makes things a lot easier."

Having tried X-Plane since version 8, I can tell you that this 64bit architecture kicks everthing else in the teeth.  I've invested plenty of time and money into FSX, long before it was FSX or the Steam version, trying to get the most realistic flight simulation possible.  X-Plane 11 out of the box makes FSX obsolete.The XP11 community is huge and free is a common word within it.  I was shocked to see such detail for my small hometown airport and the larger feeder airport nearby.  Ai traffic is now present, works very well and is adjustable.  If you can't find the details you want for your local airport, thenx-plane.orgwill get you going in the right direction with a huge database of free airports, scenery, aircraft and addons created by the community.The flight physics are incredibly realistic and no lookup tables are used.  Blade element theory is used, which results in a much more realistic flight model.  The user interface is simple and intuitive.  It recognized both my xbox360 controller and logitech 3d pro stick.  I recommend X-Life Deluxe for an Ai traffic addon and XEnviro for a weather addon, although, you don't really need these.  Like Air Hauler 2 or FSPassengers for a professional pilot/mission type of experience? Then you're in luck because the MyPassengerX plugin is coming soon:http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/108724-mypassengerx-plugin/&page=2#comment-1152939There are too many youtube videos out there that will convince you that this is the most affordable, expandable, realistic, friendlly flight community, TONS of FREE stuff out there flight simulator on the market.  It's a bit intimidating at first for a newcomer, but aviation isn't simple.  Once you learn a few things about how XP11 works, you'll never look back.Beware! This kind of realism comes at a heavy price in regards to your PC performance.  I play this on an 8-year-old i7 860 CPU (2.8-3.46 GHz), an equally old motherboard, GTX 760 W/2GB VRAM, slow 1TB HDD and 20GB DDR3 RAM at 1920x1080 resolution, Process Lasso & ParkControl (Free versions) and pagefile/virtual memory turned off.  I get 30-35 FPS and this appears to be common even on high-end PC's.The demo does not represent the actual performance of the game.  It is much better in  terms of FPS and overall experience.  The demo almost changed my purchasing decision because it SUCKED!If you are like many lovers of the flight simulation genre, then you may find yourself tweaking many settings to find the FPS ""G-Spot"".  Once you're done screwing around and decided you're about to hit the refund button or throw a kitten out of a window, then go to the x-plane 11>output>preferences folder and delete everything in it and start over.  You'll thank me for that later and probably get a big FPS boost out of it as well.  Just make sure you have any payware activation keys/codes in hand when you do this.  Don't worry, it works.  Happy flying!This is the future of flight simulation."

One problem I have is communications with ATC, sometimes it has you do a 30 minute go around if your approach to your destination isn't perfect. Also the G1000 isn't completely functional with the GPS and autopilot. However the best thing I found about the simulator is that a saitek yoke from 2010 works 100% with Xplane 11. Do I recommend this simulator. Of course. It's great practice for someone who is actually trying to get a pilots license but, IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR YOUR TRAINING, your ground school should have an actual training simulator onsite and you have actual planes to learn to fly in.

I own the non-Steam edition of FSX and I think that X-Plane is a superior simulator. The included aircraft are fantastic and have detailed 3D clickable cockpits. However, since I am a combat flight simulator user this is definitely where the game falls behind which is understandable since X-Plane is mainly for Airliners. I bought the game as there is a Eurofighter mod which DCS doesn't have and it is one of my favourite aircraft. As I was saying before, in terms of combat X-Plane isn't as accurate as DCS or BMS but the weapons systems are still great and fun to use. The game is near impossible to run at maximum settings unless you are willing to spend ridiculous amounts of money on hardware. With an i5 and a GTX 970 I run it  near maximum settings at 20fps which sounds awful but it isn't really noticable like it would be in a competitive first person shooter. Make sure you mod this game since it is so easy and there are so many great texture and graphics mods out there to make it look even greater.

The pros and cons I'm going to list are more geared as a comparison between FSX and XP.Pros:1. Physics. Flight dynamics feel much more realistic (you can really feel the plane cutting through the air)2. Software Stability3. Weather/AtmosphereCons:1. Garbage ATC. I thought FSX's atc was simplictic but seriously considered returning this game because of how poor and inaccurate the atc is. 2/3 approaches ATC will not give you clearance to land and continue to spam you with altitude adjustments. The only reason I haven't thrown the game back is because the forums say this is a problem the Xplane team plans to fix. For now it's definitely holding me back from playing a ton more as I am not experienced enough to be on vatsim yet.2. Wish we had more advanced control with graphics adjustment.Honestly the game is phenomenal and will be my go to Flight Sim from now on.

,Recommended,269950,33460319,Posted: 11 July,all,roosta,"11/10 Gr8 B8 M8. Been simming since FS9 and I've found the best overall experience in XP11.What I really found different about XP11 compared to those I had flown in the past were how its flight dynamics were portrayed in their engine. P3D and FSX always had a ""flat"" feel to its flight dynamics, whereas XP11 has a much more realistic feeling. It seems that physics between the wind and the aircraft's wings are actually modelled, so your flight will most likely feel quite a bit more ""bumpy"", as opposed to the ""flat"" experience in P3D/FSX. In this way, it is a bit more difficult to fly in XP11, but there is no greater satisfaction than when you finally get that perfect flare and soft landing.The community in XP11 has been astonishing, with so many quality freeware addons available that would cost a fortune in P3D. I highly recommend Ortho4XP for photorealistic scenery, the numerous airport sceneries by MisterX, as well as simHeaven's VFR Landmarks.The Zibo 737-800 and the FMOD soundpack that goes along with it, is one of the best freeware addons for XP11 right now and is comparable to many payware addons I've flown in the past. Not quite a PMDG 737NGX experience, but pretty darn close and not $70. Reshade is a nice graphical enhancement, just find a preset and tune it to your liking. You'll find many more sceneries and utilities that will aid your simming experience on the org.There are of course flaws such as the far less appealing clouds, limited weather, jagged shadows, lack of seasons, and bad ATC, but I find them to be minor and they don't harm my sim experience too much. (Pilot2ATC is a great offline ATC alternative, or just use VATSIM online)Performance is pretty okay (i7-4790K and GTX970) and I am usually above 35 frames, but it can drop to 25 in heavy overcast/autogen.I will admit that there is still a lack of payware addons. The FlightFactor 757, 767, IXEG 737, JAR A330 (w/ BSS Soundpack), and Rotate MD-80 are probably the best payware airliners out there currently. FlightFactor's 777 is aged and desperately needs a cosmetic update, but it is a must for my long-haul flights. XPRealistic Pro is a must have for those who want a much more immersive experience. Weather addons are very limited, but ActiveSky have announced that they will support XP11 in the future and xEnviro is available currently. Once more developers (especially PMDG) turn to XP11, this sim will simply be the best in the future. As of now, it feels limited because there aren't as many payware addons as P3D, but this may be due in part, because I largely fly airliners.There is no perfect sim out there, but X-Plane 11 has been the most satisfying experience for me. It is my hope that Laminar Research will continue to improve this sim and that more developers will turn to XP11 to offer a better and more competitive freeware/payware market that will contribute in making this sim even better."

I am coming from DCS (not steam version) but comparing this to DCS 2.0 with mult purchsed modules, track ir 5,and Nevada map it just doesn't compare.  DCS is high fidelity, refined and puts you in the cockpit with that head on a swivel feel.  Xplane 11 is slow and clunky.  Track ir 5 support is lame, my head clips through the seat or out of the plane entirely, blocking my view if I am not extremely careful.  IMO DCS 2.0 looks better, feels real with track ir and when you are engaged in a dogfight online the Game engine doesn't get in the way of thrill of it.  I guess it'll work for plugging along in a slow Cessna or a airliner and if that's all you want or expect it'll do.  I'm just disappointed because I had high expectations and hopes coming from DCS which has been out for years.  Also the graphics are kind of poor.  The screen shots that drew me in really just turned out to be cherry picked spots and angles that do not represent what 99% of the game looks like. I only recommend it because it's a good tool for someone going for their private pilot license that needs to get some basics down, or for someone that loves civilian aircraft and want a game that is focused on that type of aircraft."
,Recommended,269950,31272034,Posted: 21 April,all,rioki,"X-Plane 11 is a solid upgrade from X-Plane 10, but some key improvements are missing.Laminar Research, X-Plane's creator, did a very good visual upgrade to X-Plane 11 and brought all the things that worked fine in X-Plane 10 along. The simulation and flight model is still one of the most accurate in hard desktop simulation. They reworked the user interface into a more gamey appearance. Although I don't really like the look, but it still remains a solid upgrade in usability over the old interface.A key new feature is the integration of ATC and AI aircraft. Something that MS-Flight Simulator has built in stock. Unfortunately in the current state this feature is lacking. You can only work with IRF flight plans. You don't know take off and landing runways to expect and the ATC get's regularly confused, if you don't hit way points exactly.The AI aircraft are a nice addition, but you can only select a small number. There is no plausible traffic generated and the aircraft ignore your presence. (I had multiple aircraft taxi  though my aircraft.)One further addition is the map. The map is zoomable down to the airport and contains navigation aids, such as ILS and VOR with frequencies. This removes the need to go look for additional charts before heading off for a quick flight.The stock aircraft are well build, with he exception of the Cirrus Vision SF50, which has a half functional glass cockpit.All in all a nice simulator, with some room for improvement."

They suddenly stop and start out of nowhere, jagged turns, roadsigns with names of areas are just random ones from the same country, cars move awkwardly at the exact same speed. The roads and railroads doesnt look anywhere like the real world version. I got lost immediately when trying to fly from a local airport, as I could not recognise any man made structures.- Very poorly optimized. My water cooled overclocked rig with 12 CPU cores and GTX 1080 Ti is struggling to maintain a good framerate. But it has no issues with any modern games that has far superior graphics to this one.- Weird physics. For example while standing parked on the runway the ground is shaking like crazy.- Awkward controls. It looks like the simulator requires a joystick. Steering with a mouse is not working well. For example if you navigate the map then go back to controlling the plane, it will go completely out of control as the mouse is not where the simulator expected it to be, And generally it is quite awkward. Even just taking off without weering off the runway is very hard when using a mouse.- Some of the controls in the cockpit does not respond to touching them. I know controls controlling cabin heat and similar is not actually going to do anything in the simulation, but it would still be nice to be able to fiddle with everything to make the simulation more realistic.- Graphical issues. It has a lot of problems with water. Reflections are shaky and water generally looks dull. Scenery has a lot of issues too, like blocky hills and ugly seams in the landscape.- Tutorials are a bit old fashioned and clunky. Everything is based on dialogue boxes with text that is not always well thought out. For example the second dialogue box in the tutorial explains how to get to the next one. Which is silly since you obviously already made it to the next one at that point.- Add on scenery, like airports, are very expensive.- Not a lot to see. Do not expect to use the simulator to explore an area of earth. It is offering repeating autogenerated content, with some low resolution satellite textures.  Same buildings, road type, road signs, trees and so on. Over and over. You get no real sense of being in the area you area flying over.Positive:- Well, for all its flaws, probably one of the best and most accurate flight simulators on the market today. It is a niche product, so it is understandable they do not have the resources to polish it like we are used to with games for the mass market. And when covering the entire world, it is also understandable it is hard to maintain a high level of detail.- The whole world is covered, all major airports included, although most of the man made structures are inaccurate or missing entirely.- Flight simulation seems to be quite accurate. Looks like a good tool to familiarize yourself with flying before or while taking real flying lessons.The simulation seems to have good support with many new improvements all the time, so I am giving this a recommendation after all. It does fulfill its intended purpose, but it is easy to see how it could improve in many ways."

With Dovetail not committing to VR for Flight School and FlightSimWorld, it looks like it's down to X-Plane, Aerofly FS2, and DCS for VR. FSX-SE and P3D with FlyInside also do VR, but FSX-SE is single-threaded staticware now that Dovetail is moving on and P3D has all the licensing issues. I'm more of a civilian pilot in style though I do love flying the warbirds in civilian airspace, so DCS is not quite appropriate but still an excellent flight sim in VR. That leaves Aerofly and X-Plane for now and I have to say the better of the two is X-Plane 11 for me.

However, what you are paying is for continued support in the X-plane platform. I personally would only recommend X-plane 11 at the moment to those who are new in more serious flight simulation or people who are starting X-plane as a new platform from another platform. There are nice new features over 10 such as graphics and the new UI is a step in the right direction. But in terms of fuctionality, its still mostly the same with some of the best addons/DLC only supporting xplane 10 at the moment. All of that will change in time for the better, and xplane 11 will see even more new features than before. Knowing Laminar Research, they don't promiss much so we do not know much on what is coming but they will deliver new awesome features over X-plane 11 life so it will be a worthwhile investment. I'd say in a year or two , X-plane 11 will be more than worthwhile upgrade over 10, and there will be plenty of awesome features and content. As for the excisting new features, they added  a new sound system for developers to use that will make the expierance better, and the reflections and colors in the graphics engine upgrade is good. I personally do not think the UI is as good as it could be since It feels like they ripped it off the Iphone/Android app and feels more suited for touchscreen. As for stoch aircraft, the new models look good and they fly ok, but the sound and systems are not great except maybe for the Cessna 172 which features the new sound system and the only default one to do so. But X-plane brightest aircraft were always from 3rd party developers anyways and xplane focuses more as a platform to run simulation on than anything anyway. If you are buying xplane for the first time and you want to get into xplane, this is the one you should get. Xplane 11 is the future."

I also have done all flying on Mac OSX.The graphics are superb - especially given my Mac is not the most up to date, but things looked very good.Give yourselve time to learn the shortcuts.  I typically find myself with one hand flying with the joystick and the other using the keyboard until I map more of the common keys over to the joystick.I was disappointed in the Cirrus SF-50's lack of a way to set the transponder.  But that was quickly resolved by updating my local files from the communityX-plane.orgwebsite.I flew twice into an airport with ATC and experienced a hard crash of the game.  Someone noted this is a known issue an to be resolved in the next update.I then flew via ATC into a different airport, noticing that both departure and destination airports had full ATC and ground; and after landing; received a message that ATC terminated service.  Which was odd because the website it took me to explained I confused the system by having landing when ATC expected me to be flying, etc.Overall happy with my purchase.

That said, anybody who buys X-Plane 11 can relax in the knowledge that it is supported by a reputable company who will not abandon it, and the added benefit of a well established Flight sim and modding community.It`s worth mentioning to prospective buyers that if you are at all unsure whether your rig will run X-Plane 11 you can download a demo version direct from Laminar Research`s web page.(http://www.x-plane.com/)Edit: You can now get a VR driver/Add-on for X-Plane 11 called Flyinside, it makes the game the closest you`ll get to flying for real ouside of a commercial simulator, (in my opinion of course)."

My reaction after this huge dowload was disappointment.First thing I noticed was the lack of AI traffic. And, if you do add AI traffic, it seems to load it as a whole separate fully detailed aircraft in the game, so more than a few and framerates even on powerful gaming rigs drop immensely.Second thing I noticed was the HORRIBLE ATC. I thought FSX was pretty poor, not allowing enough dialogue such as requesting an alternate runway (especially often being directed to land on dry ground in seaplanes or on waterways in landplanes. Well, that's not even a problem anymore, because ATC is absolutely useless if you're not going cross country, and even then it's poor and ridden with glitches.Third thing I noticed was the garbage stock scenery. Sure, roads are mapped pretty well, traffic and houses are randomly generated but there, and it all looks nice. Airports, however, are trash. If it's not a major airport, it won't have aircraft or structures. At all. You'll have an airport diagram, as it looks on a VFR chart, emblazoned upon the earth in generic pavement texture. Don't expect anything else. This isn't even minor airports, either. I'm talking everything up to regional and small international airports. My home airport, Fairbanks International, doesn't even have a terminal modeled. It's just two runways and bare, empty ramps. The float pond isn't mapped as a runway, and the only parking available is on the commercial ramp in one place, despite there being a whole unused GA ramp, not to mention the cargo aprons. Don't like it? Buy add-on scenery at $12-35/airport, if they make one for the place you wanna fly.Whatever, so what? I just wanna fly, right? Well that's the fourth thing. The flight models handle well in the air, however, the stick interfaces vary by plane. Some aircraft, for instance, the brakes will be impossibly grabby (take the L-5, which in real life has almost useless drum brakes), requiring you to turn sensitivity way down to avoid ground looping. The next aircraft will be the opposite. Among all aircraft, expect incomplete cockpits. Anything with a G1000 is totally lacking the GPS features and the audio panel. Boeing FMC's work 60% of the time, every time. Don't like it? Go buy some payware planes at $25-50 a pop until you get something that meets basic standards.And that's the real kick in the nuts with X-Plane. EVERYTHING IS PAYWARE. At least with FSX you had Simviation, which was full of hundreds of freeware models, sceneries, and utilities to choose from. Of those, at least half were of pretty darn good quality. With X-Plane, there's a few utilities and plug-ins that make things a bit better for free, but anything groundbreaking will cost you. Expect to have $200 invested in this game before it's the upgrade from FSX you were hoping for.Oh, and if that's not enough, it freezes at random, crashes at random, has no missions or goals to keep flying interesting, and the flight instruction is essentially how to get different types in the air and very basic VOR navigation. Don't expect to get help, say, landing that helicopter or taildragger once you're up and fully lost though."

Also free airplane have often no interactive gps navigation which make it impossible to use. Graphic of landscapes is nice though city looks all the same with all the same buildings so nothing like region dlcs claim. In addition everything is very hard to figure out and needs a lot of youtube videos because the in game tutorials not teach much

No state capitols or anything.I feel as if the improved flight modeling of X-Plane is comparable to a high quality payware FSX addon, like something with Accusim. Lack of actual city skyline recreations without an abundance of scenery addons leaves a lot to be desired still in this less popular flight sim."

X-Plane 10 was definitly ahead of it's time and I still believe it is a great sim.  Since the release of the IXEG 737, and the 1.2 update officially offering XP11 support, I see no reason to go back to Microsofts platform.  Compared to version 10, the atmosphere is far improved, the lighting looks correctly saturated and appealing, the shading and colors look life like, and the entire sim is optimized beautifully (even more so in the coming update).  The flight dynamics feel better and the entire scene is more convincing.  The default clouds are greatly improved compared to XP10, although in full overcast, they are resource heavy.  Xenviro or SMP could help with this.  I am disapointed that we lost some more advanced control over the graphical settings, but it makes it easier for new users to get into it, without adjusting settings for days.  The joystick and control implementation is much better, as are the menus.  There is no annoying pauses and everything is internal.  Microstuttering seems to be no longer an issue, although I have adjusted my Nvidia settings.  I run XP11 with a GTX 970 overclocked, 16 GB of DDR4, and a 6700k at 4.6Ghz and run an average of 40-50 FPS on pretty much all scenarios, with dips into high 20s to low 30s with overcast skies.

I have had landing clearance when another aircraft was on the runway, been sent off on a vector away from the airfield with no further contact and it tried to land me on a down wind runway once.

Flying close to the ground resulted in an often times blurry un interesting mess and using add on's often resulted in VAS.X-plane 11 right out of the box is a graphical upgrade over fsx in every way. plane models, scenery, weather scenery are breath taking at times. And all this eye candy is well optimized. I run everything maxed out AA off on a fx 8350 gtx 970 and 16 gigs of ram at 40fps.The game is a great simulator everything is there atc, aerodynamics, actual damage to the plane if you crash it ( yep found that out the hard way)  UI dosn't get much friendlier than this. Coming off fsx I had no trouble configuring settings configuring my aircraft, weather, air ports .There are some glaring issues however.First and my absolute biggest pet peeve with x-plane 11. ATC and traffic around the airport. Request clearances .atc "" a gate hold is in effect for a runway change please hold"" 10,20,30 minutes later you are still waiting as this lone sr-71 meanders around the air port and then idles at a runway... or you do get clearances only to be stuck inline waiting for a plane to taxi onto the runway and take off.... only it never takes off just sits there waiting. Luckly this is easily fixed by downloading a bit of freeware. X-life. But it is still a bug that needs to be worked out of the game( I am pretty sure it is a bug) Also the atc with out x-life will often get stuck in an annoying loop with issuing orders to said sr-71.. constantly telling it to decend in alt. with it constantly confirming the order.... a default flight from kphl to kpit I eventually had to mute atc as it was driving me nuts.My other gripe is the variety in aircraft. The pickings are bare bones as airliners go. The md-82 the 737 and 747. A 777 or dc-10 would have been nice. Technically there is the military version of the dc-10 and a few extra planes but over all it just feels very bare for 60bucks . I am sure the roster will be fleshed out via paid add ons...My 3rd complaint is the air ports and locations. while air ports runways and taxi ways are all laid out correctly they are all very generic looking and major cities have no landmarks. They all still look nice but newyork looks like chicago looks like LA . It's not a deal breaker but a little more detail there would have been apperciated.Over all I reccomend the ""game "" to any one who loves flight sims. Some annoyance and nit picking, aside it is a great sim and a absolute improvment over fsx in every single way. Though, if you have hunders of dollars in payware aircraft for fsx or x-plan 10 you will be dissapointed at the pickins as air craft go."

I have't played X-Plane 10 mostly because this is my upgrade from FSX (now very outdated) and the graphics in this game are AMAZING! Yes they are a bit frame rate heavy but there are so many more features I love. The AI are not the best and they need some work on (like how they try to land and takeoff through buildings) and how the shading blocks up a bit occasionally. So yes, this game needs a bit of work, but if they fix these bugs, it could be the best flight sim on the market currently. It is a great game and that's all that matters."

The graphics out of the box are great and with addons like bluFX and/or Reshade you can make the simulator look even better and both BluFX and Reshade are free. In my opinion the autogen is really accurate but it could look better. If you are a budget simmer you should use x-plane 11 but if you are a take my money simmer you should use p3d.

,Not Recommended,269950,31126219,Posted: 13 April,all,kirtanloorii,"$60 sim with a very small selection of planes. While I do like the engine, the lack of planes alone make me feel that this is just not worth $60. Also, for some reason the sim does not have a proper GPS like what is in Microsoft Flight Simulator X. Meaning that if you do not know how to communicate with the radio or program the navigation system, you will never find your destination. Even the DCS series has a proper map. I saw some threads in the community hub where people were asking about this, and the devs responded by saying that there is no ""magic"" map. A $60 skeleton sim was bad enough, but the attitude just kills it for me. I'll check this out again in a year when they lower the price by 50%, double the selection of planes AND add a proper GPS system for those who just like to fly."

What FSX did better was the way it made it simple to pick departures and arrivels. Xplane 11 has no way of setting up a flight plan unless you go to certain websites to look up the letters for the airport you want and then input it into the flight nav system on the planes. Also, speaking of planes, for the price I'd have expected a wider selection of commercial planes rather than the 4 that you can choose from. The rest are biplanes and a helicopter. Not what i was expecting for the price. The Airports look generic and plain. The ground textures are slightly better than FSX. I'd wait for it to go on sale if you don't want to blow that amount of money on it. It isn't worth it for the content in my opinion. Also, It crashed on me and I have a gtx 1070 16 gb ram"

Unfortunately I can't recommend the game. It crashes all the time. It might be a plugin that I have, but here's the deal on plugins:The built in G1000 stinks.The Cirrus SF50 lacks a transponder and it's G1000 stack is buggy and hard to use.The built in FMS on bigger aircraft is absolutely terrible.So if you want to do any simulations at all involving GPS in a non-prop aircraft, you need to buy addons. Most of the higher end addon planes for XP11 include redone G1000's, knock off Aspens, or other custom glass panels. This is for a reason, because XP11's defaults past the G530 are terrible.So I have $100 in addon planes from well known names, and my XP11 crashes all the time. I haven't tried removing the planes, because why? If the game doesn't work with them, then it's only good for VFR stuff.I asked for my money back on this game after playing it for 6 hours and steam denied it. So since then I've put a couple dozen hours more into the game. It's really hard to like it when you spend an hour on route planning, pre-flight, startup, loading the FMS...and then 10 minutes after you depart, it crashes. Really really hard to like a game like that.I was on the beta, I moved off of it thinking maybe that's it...nope.Who knows, but if this game doesn't have the modularity of FSX/P3D, then it's limited to it's out-of-the-box state...which aside from looks, is something that should be a free early release preview."

76561197990732510,Recommended,269950,31102860,Posted: 12 April,all,RVM,"Basic review of X Plane 11 from a FSX user. I have been using FSX since it came out and never used XP before.I decided to give XP a go and its awesome and a bit frustrating.First the good stuff.-Graphics. For a standard sim its unbelievable!!-Flight model. Very realistic and much better than FSX.-The general scenery is very nice.-Airport scenery is awesome.The bad.-Graphics. Don't for one moment think you are going to get anywhere near playable FPS with the recommended requirements. You need a beast of a PC to run this at max settings.-Scenery. Don't get me wrong its amazing but at more than 60 GB there is still so much missing. For example I live in South Africa so I do most of the flying in that region. My hometown airport FARG is amazing but FAOR(OR Tamb Int airport) which is the main hub and the most busiest airport in Africa has no buildings, proper markings or ground services. Bit strange if you ask me.-Bugs, There is a lot of bugs like a Beechcraft Baron 58 suddenly starts flying like a Cessna because one engine is just missing. Lots of random game crashes.-Setting up of controls. The sim will id your joystick automatic but to fine tune it is very hard. 3rd party apps is what you need here but once everything is tuned its awesome.-ATC. Just horrible. Freaks out and gives very bad directions. No taxi control with small aircraft.-Flight planning, FSX was very easy. XP not so much.Most of the bad stuff is just bugs that will be fixed with the first patch, hopefully.Then a word of advice for all the FSX users. Changing to XP is not at all easy. Everything is different so you will need to take the time to read and watch a lot of videos but in the end its worth it.I recommend this sim but rather wait till the first patch to avoid frustration."

For weeks I've tried flying the same route from CYYZ to KBOS with all kinds of varying results. It doesn't help too that the save flight feature does not properly restore the state of your plane as you'd hope. You have to restart your pre-flight setup everytime. I'm talking about flying using the FMC of course, cause who wants to fly VFR? I'd just go back to Elite Dangerous or GTA5 for that."

I played Microsoft Flight for years and then largely IL2 and Later Lock DCS. Graduate to IL2 Battle of Stalingrad (Amazing) and stumbled accross Aerofly FS 2 (simply incredible). So as I am learning to fly I decided that X Plane 11 might be a little old but had a reputation for extreme accuracy, graphics and realism. I purchased the game ( I think it was on discount circa €50). After less than 2 hours play I returned it. It wasnt terrible, but the landscapes were just very basis, the movement (even on my new gtx1080 pc) was not very fluid and overall I felt it was simply too dated (night flying looks good on it). It was easy use, fly around in etc, just for me it was not modern enough. I recently got a rift and use it with both IL2 and Aerofly FS 2 and they are simply outstanding. I'm not recommending this game as I think its time has passed, Seems to me Aerofly FS 2 is the choice for the next five years of simming."

If there is real pilot or simulation lovers stop wasting your time by reading my review and do not buy it and back your fsx or p3d...Dear arcade lovers,Please do not compare games with your poor experience and absolutely SIMULATORS! Graphics, yes it's looking cute but not realistic at all. Mario has cute graphics too. This game created by 3d engine so this game never ever'll have photorealistic graphics. Boeing 737-800 looks like cartoon. Absouletely looks like Cities Skylines!Sounds, yes they tried effects but needs a lot of fixes and engine sounds not realistic like PMDG!Realism, there is no realism and i did not find realism settings except G-Factor damage which doesn't work. If you start diving to ground with 450kt you can easly save aircraft from 500feet. You can really fly like f-16 maybe with better characteristics. There is no drag factor and you can climb 90 degree with 737 after takeoff. If you still think it's realistic just try barrel roll in X-Plane11 and check this videos from youtube /watch?v=A7SqcEHRa-U      /watch?v=gnOI_s4x8f0If you think they'll release add-ons please do not wait for it for 10 years. Weather engines, sceneries, Photoreals, great physics, aircrafts, Vatsim connection and if you use your own company apps. We've waited pmdg's 737 maybe for 3 years!!!

I started this series experience with X-Plane 9, didn't think much of 10 but did my best at enjoying a slightly polished version of 9. Now... 11 is looks really good and the interface/GUI for settings, weather, & aircraft are the best ever for X-Plane. Game runs fast and seems to balance rendering well with my system. After playing this sim for 2hrs I have uninstalled FSXSE and ready for the next 1-2 years of community mods and payware planes. My biggest concern with purchasing this was my system being able to handle it; haven't touched my system/hardware (no choice really) and the game looks great (mid-high settings). They have done a great job; highly recommend this one.Cons: ATC sucks still...they did make a better GUI with ATC but still - was hopping for voice-syn. I did see (X-Plane forum) they're working on this issue with Microsoft. Last issue, they dropped some of their 'legacy' aircraft from 9 and 10.*MSI GT72 6QD Dominator (i7-6820HK, 16gb RAM, GTX970M) - Laptop"

I'm currently running this with a HTC Vive using FlyInside on the default graphics settings for the GTX 970.  So far I'm pleased with the upgraded graphics from FSX and XP10.  I've only had a chance to mess around with the Cessna 172 and the Beechcraft Baron.  I'll list some pros and cons from my experience so far and will update this review later when I have a chance to get more indepth with the various components of XP11.Pros:Fully interactive cockpit!  Even the vents are interactive!  There is no handy pop-up window that will let you know what the switch is from a distance though, but if you already know what you're doing it's not that much of a problem. LOLFlyInside + HTC Vive = Mind blowing experience for the flight sim fan!  FSX with FlyInside was AWESOME!  Even for a game from 2006, the VR gave it all new legs and I sunk another 40 hours in on it since getting VR in November.  There are still some graphical settings I need to tweak in XP11 however.Very indepth simulator that you can fine tune for your experience.  I can't wait to play with Plane Maker on this one.  I got some more free time and will probably sink a bunch of hours in it trying to create some ultralights and gyrocopters I've had my eye on tinkering with in real life... Looking at modeling the Sport Copter II and the Carter Copter.Cons:Currently experiencing some graphic glitches and tearing.  I haven't played with the settings much since I've just picked it up and started playing yesterday at the time of this review.  I'm also upgrading to the 1080 Ti within the month too so my opinion may hopefully change.Landscaping isn't as accurate as FSX in terms of the coloring.  For example, when I was working on my license last year in San Diego I would fly touch and goes between Gillespie Field and Browns Field and the terrain was fairly accurate in FSX.  However in XP11, it looked much different and I even missed the turn for a long final because I couldn't find the runway!  I almost flew into Tijuana to line up with TIA.No Velocity XL model yet!  I have one for both FSX and XP10.  Now I'm going to have to figure out how to import it :(If you have VR and are a flight sim fan, this is a must have.  I'm sure the goodies from the community will be similar to XP10 and there will be a lot to enjoy in the future."

Even tried out a few demo versions but always backed off because of the horrendous UI. So now X plane 11 comes along promising an improved UI. The current Steam sale took away the last of my reservations; I purchased my first X plane game!My thoughts on my purchase ...- The UI of X plane 11 is a vast improvement over what I have seen in the past. That is for the part that is working. :( Currently entering any menu (or returning to the main menu) while I am in flight causes the game to crash. I have not sorted this out yet. The UI and menus on initiation of the game are very well done and intuitive, though.- I have really got addicted to flying in VR, so I also purchased FlyInside to enjoy flying X plane in VR. Although the ground level detail is very nice, the overall impression and performance of X plane in VR felt dissapointing. Compared to the crisp VR images that are presented by IPAC's Aerofly 2, the VR experience of X plane feels a little bit 'flat'. I hope the developers will soon support native VR. That will probably liven up the experience.- I like it that the world has come alive with other vehicles and planes. It could be a bit more busy though; it all looks like a lazy sunday morning, hardly any traffic about.- The realisme of the simulator feels great. There are lots of controls and situations to master.All in all, not displeased with my purchase. Hope to conquer the persisting crashes and will definitely pick up on this simulator more frequently when native VR support is added."

It looks great but it has one major unforgiveale flaw,  one can't control the plane except by the keyboard and who wants to run a flight simulator like that.  Internally it recognizes my Cyborg controller but beyond calibrating it, it never recognizes it.  Every other flight sim on the market does including X-Plane's predessessor.  That basically leaves me trying to fly a plane that is not congrollable.  My expierence with x-plane 11 is only crash and burn.  So disappointed.I published this in a review and got seriously put down by the x-plane community so badly that I retracted it.  Big mistake.  I went back and and investigated my detractors and discovered that most of them hadn't bought the product or spend no time in it if they did.  So much for Steam reviewwers who wickedly judged my real-time expierience in the game with their percieved outcome of what they thought x-plane 11 should be.  Shame on them.So here this user is months later trying to fly the plane again, hoping that updates fixed my original problem.  Sadly, it still does not not work, not even a little.  It's still me dead at the controls until the plane crashes and burns.  Sad.  This user flies Microsoft X flawlessly and Flight Sim World woked perfectly right out of the box.  This simulator is nothing but contratry.X-Plane 11 is so unintuative that it is simply NOT worth your time.  This user started from scratch and tried to work through the tutorials, look at the key commands and spent a rediculous amount of time looking in the settings to set up my joystick, the program still recognizes my Cyborg controller.  I calibrate it and exit.  From there on it means absolutely nothing, the tutorials take one right to the key commands and joystick input is simply not recognizeable.  We tried free flight, same problem.  MAJOR FAIL.  THIS SIMULATION SIMPLY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE A JOYSTICK.  I have tried several others, same problem.   NOTHING WORKS.  CRASH & BURN.The menu options are the most ambigious descriptions ever and don't fit the general mode of flight simulation.  It appears that one can set many flight dynamics to enhance the simulation but without any basic controls, even that is worthless.  There is one option for control, the KEYBOARD and that method absolutely stinks.Save your money.  Stick with Flight Sim X or buy Flight Sim World.  Both are far better options.And this time, I won't be intimidated into taking this truthful review down.Until this developer seriously fixes the joystick problem and interface this Sim should be avoided at all costs."

,Not Recommended,269950,32599360,Posted: 20 June,all,Ahmad Abou Hashem,I will never recommend X-Plane again until they fix the ATC. I am not able to complete any flight using their ATC. it forgets me in the middle of the flight. this problem has been from X-Plane 10 and they don't want to work on fixing it.

Trying to use this to improve my Heli IFR skills but its more painfull than a benifit to be honest, cant believe in this day and age we dont have a reasonable flight sim, havent seen any real improvment since I first tried FSX 8 years ago. And why cant they have built in customisable key bindings for different aircraft.. why should I have to reassign all they keys everytime I want to change aircraft...."
