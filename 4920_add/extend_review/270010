76561198075525997,Not Recommended,270010,31592303,Posted: 6 May,all,budwheizzah,"Dead abandoned ""VR"" game that does not support VR. Literally this game was made specifically for VR then abandoned faster than you can say ""refund please"" (purchased in pre refund days, rip). The developer talks about Oculus not supporting Unity 4, but the truth is it would take them the greater part of 15 minutes to implement SteamVR which works in Unity 4 (Valve's own statement: Requires Unity 4.7.1 or higher.) and would yield support for both headsets.Ironically the dev brushes off VR and explains away the fact they've removed it by saying ""We will consider VR in our future projects."" What a joke."

,Recommended,270010,12747210,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,reckhou,"I played this game on my friend's computer, and I was shocked by its art style & gameplay. So I rushed home, bought this game and wrote this review. I've already played it for hours.This game was in my wishlist in days. I have to say its art style impressed me, but it's not enough for me to gave it a try since it's terrible gameplay trailer: This video only showed some shooting scene, but the game's core mechanics -- you co-op with 3 other yourselves was not shown in the video! I feel lucky not miss this game, and for developers: you really need to learn how to make a trailer to help your game sale better :)After the trailer ""disaster"", everything went smooth. You have to shoot down every cubics in the level to have a 100% completion, but time is limited, there's no way for you to shoot all of them down in 60 seconds. But you have 3 other ""yourselves"" to help you! When time's out, you will become the next ""yourself"", and you will play along with the last ""yourselves"", they will perform EXACTLY what you have done just like back in time! This makes game pretty interesting: you have to find correct steps, combine suitable weapons, remember your past moves, and decide the best strategy for 100% level completion.The game's art style is simple but elegant. GUI system is the most innovative I've ever seen. I don't know how they implemented that in Unity, but it's better than what I've thought. The starting scene is also a ""wow"" moment, you have to include this in your trailer :)For me, I will give this game a 8.5/10. 9.99$ is a fair price, worth buying.Pros:+ Art style+ Innovative gameplay+ Weapon Strategy & CombinationCons:- Bad trailer(alright, it's not the game's fault)- Need some weapon balance or level adjustment, too easy to find ""best solution"""

It is amazing how i can play this game for hours and feel good. i played the demo for quite a long time, and you always wanted to replay the trickier levels, because you wanted that perfect score, , this game kinda nails it, i think the stylized, more abstract nature of the game presentation is responsible for that.Some very challenging levels later on making you wish you would have 2 more turns , the levels have high replayability factor, you always look for that right combination of weapons and tasks for each of your turns.If you have a rift, i very much recomend this game."

,Recommended,270010,17361512,"Posted: 2 August, 2015",all,Khaesho,"I've played puzzle platformers where you play with previous copies of yourself, but this is the first time I've seen anyone attempt an FPS with the concept. That said, this game pulls the idea beautifully. I'll start with pros, then follow with con'sPro's:-A simple and sqift movement system ensures that your copies will move and shoot the -exact- way you did when you recorded it, ensuring that the damage they do is reliable for ever added clone.-A varied weapons list gives you plenty of options for unique situations; even with the same weapon, you can upgrade it differently to specialize it. (EX. My first run I take a spread pistol with scatter and acid to melt a large number of soft blocks, and my last run I take a spread pistol with maxed damage and fire rate for single block cleanup.-Smooth gameplay and lack of danger let you really focus on efficiency. Memory, attention, and planning are rewarded: you don't need to kill the same block in a second go, the first clone will take care of it.-Each run is color coded to let you see where and what you did before, you can even watch where your curser pointed on previous runs!-Community built rooms and levels add a dose of the insane (Some crafters are just nuts.)Simply put, the game is fun. Its easy to learn, fun to play, its bright, and its colorful. It has a unique concept that plays beautifully as you orchaestrate your victory.Cons:-The game is short. The standard ""Campaign"" Can be beaten in an hour. It'll take longer if you want to 100% all the levels (Which is HARD) but it won't take you too long.-Community levels, while they add on length, are simplified; they can't have moving blocks, and they lack the elaborate setpieces found in the Campaign.-You play the camp in sets of 5 levels, with 4 runs per level. Each run takes a solid 20 minutes, and there is no replay button. You can't replay an individual time loop, you can't even replay an individual level. You want another try, you start from literally square one. This is frustrating, especially when I missed the. Last. Block. of a level. 20 minutes of stress and effort, down the pooper.-The upgrade system is neat, and upgrades carry between levels, but that's a mixed blesssing, because it means that once you chose with 4 weapons you want, you're stuck with that combo for the rest of that 5 level set. You can't even change up the order.-Your first run of the first 5 level set starts you at 0 gold, and most weapons are useless at level 1. The scatter pistol, rocket launcher, and partical ball are the only ones with enough damage to actually kill blocks at lvl 1, but the rockets are slower than christmas and the partical ball has all the range of a baseball bat. In community levels, you start with enough gold for 4 upgrades, but in the camp you get zip. So, you either start with a scatter pistol or you press the escape button.-The balancing for weapons needs work; some weapons just aren't good. The partical ball, while it has the best damage, is crippled by the short range. The rocket launcher, again, has good damage, but the rockets take so long to travel that shooting at moving targets is a waste of time. The rest of the weapons are each good in their own way, but again, only the scatter pistol is useful at level 1.-Weapon upgrades scales unrealistically high. You will never fully upgrade a weapon in the campaign, because the costs literally become more gold than is in the entire campaign. It's an indirect cap on how many upgrades you can buy and its annoying that it's there at all, much less how sharp it is.At the end of the day though, I very thoroughly enjoyed this game. The upgrade system is frustrating, but the gameplay itself is amazingly fun, and most of the problems become non-issues when you play Community levels. This game needs a serious patch to fix a lot of problems, but its a year old, so such an update is unlikely. Still, there's real potential here, and for a price tag of $10, I absolutely reccomend picking this game up.If By some fluke, a developer is reading this, then start making a sequal. Give starting gold for first weapons, allow -at minimum- a restart by stage button rather than a restart campaign button. Balance the weapons a little, maybe add a few more if you can keep them unique, and if possible, take the leash off of community level creation. This is a beautiful concept and the game engine is spotless, it just needs some tweaks and some added content."

I play with the Oculus Rift DK2 and mouse/keyboard and I really like the ""comfort-mode""-turning of the character via mouse wheel.

The game Time Rifters needs to have a bit more improvement. The way to create levels, as well as have 4 different teammates that you play as AND attempt to achieve a high score each time is really fun. However, I believe that this game really needs a multiplayer function so that you can attempt to play with your friends online. I may just be blind, but all that I saw was a way to record playthroughs to your friends or play by yourself, no live action feed, which saddened me the most. If that function were to be added, as well as separate gold for each character in the game so that some don't level up faster than others, then this game would be really fun. I still recommend this game to others, just not in the way that would be useful to most."

Me and some friends managed to form a great team together, and got through most of the arenas okay.I was Blue. I was the weakest; I admit. Always behind in upgrades. When I entered the arena, I never knew what to do like everyone else. I would shoot at whatever I saw, but the others looked at me like I could never see the bigger picture, and I always felt like my efforts were pointless against the massive cube army we were up against.Then there was Purple. He had better reflexes, better skills, better gear... he would pick out groups and take them on, trusting his teammates to take on the rest, and keeping a level head. He was a better fighter than I.After him, there was Yellow. He and Purple made a great team, and were closer than any other two team members. He always seemed to know where the enemies would come from, how to take advantage of the arena... like he'd done this before. They would split up and take on different groups, laughing at me for flailing around so helplessly.Then, Green. He was a bit odd, didn't talk much. He'd watch the rest of us, maybe help us out, but seemed content to let us handle most of the work. And yet, whenever we missed a cube, he was there, destroying it the minute it slipped past us. Without him, who knows how many more cubes would have gotten past our lines.All in all, we somehow managed to take out wave after wave. I'll never know where the others got their training, or what secrets they had. Ah well.(But seriously, it's a cool game with a cool concept. Get it.)"

However, I feel that the game would have benefited from a bit more progression, like for example if the weapons were initially locked and you would get them after accomplishing something. It would have increased the replay value. But the price isn't bad for the amount of fun, so it is easy to recommend this.The game also supports NVIDIA Surround natively (and Eyefinity, I presume). The FOV is customizable from 60 to 90.Something I would like to be see in future versions:- Allow FOV to go up to 100, or even 110. It looks better on multi monitor setups.- Allow the player body model to be hidden. It makes the platforming needlessly difficult when you can't ""see your feet"", because the model is blocking your vision.But anyways, good game, good job devs!"

,Recommended,270010,14499863,"Posted: 16 February, 2015",all,sir.pinski,"This game is really quite excellent!  The basic concept is that it's sort of a virtual reality shooting gallery.  You buy a gun, upgrade it with some gold, then hop into the level and kill as many target cubes as you can.  The cube patterns are fun and clever, sometimes even forming giant monsters that walk around the arenas.  After your time-limited run, you start again as a new character, buy new guns with the gold you earned from the last run, and then try again.  But there's a twist!  The 4 lives stack on top of one another and play out synchronously, so on your second life you'll see your first life playing along with you and you'll want to choose targets and weapons that compliment previous runs.It's a bargain price (even full price of $10 is great) and provides a very unique and fun experience that combines some good FPS challenges with a clever and interesting single-player time-based co-op mode that works extremely well.  The presentation, music, visuals - they're all slick and polished making for a great overall package.  I want to give a special shout-out to the HUD UI - all of the menus are presented in a sort of helmet-based augmented reality that feels natural and keeps you in the game; it's very clever and I want to give a high-five to whoever on the team came up with it.  I can't *wait* to get an Oculus Rift to try this game out in (which is apparently has native support for!).The amount of built-in content is admittedly low (only 3 ""episodes"" of 5 levels each, each episode takes about 20 minutes to play through), but if you work on trying to optimize and go for high scores you'll be replaying the episodes multiple times.  Additionally, it has full support for community-created levels, and I suspect they will eventually be adding more level packs if the game sells well enough to warrant it.There's also a demo, which you should definitely try out.  The only thing that's not clear from the demo that was a really pleasant surprise was that as you go through the 5 levels of an episode you get to keep spending gold upgrading your weapons.  This means that by level 5 your guns are doing crazy amounts of damage and effects on the targets, which is a great sense of progression and strategy."

76561198072680595,Recommended,270010,32777560,Posted: 25 June,all,benvlieg,"Time Rifters is a fun and enjoable little indie game.The basic objective is to destoy all the cubes in a level in a limited time. There are too many cubes to destroy in one go. This is where Time Rifters shine. After your first playthough of a level you control a second charecter. Your first still remains and does the exact thing you did with your first try. This repeats until you play a level with a fourth time. This makes for some chalanging gameplay, as you have to think ahead and plan. It can also be very chaotic to see four charecters run around in a room, shooting everywhere.There are three chapters, each containing five arenas. There are a variety of weapons each character can pick at the start of each chapter. Each gun can be upgraded between rounds with gold. Gold are found be destroying th cubes. The challange is to destroy all the cubes.The biggest problem with Time Rifters is the lack of official content. There are only 3 episodes, each only containing 5 arenas. Each arena takes 4 minuts (one minute per charecter). Thats a hour to play everything the game has. The replay value is high if you care about getting good times, but otherwise the game is short. Thankfully the devs decided to add a level editor with workshop support. This adds a lot of content, but I haven`t found anything nearly as good as the oficcial levels.Time Rifters is a great game with a unique idea. It`s defnitley worth a try."

This first-person shooter bases itself around the point of clearing areas that are so unique, its awesome! Stepping into a level gives the user the full 3D world experience and full user control of the level with time lapse features.In most cases, the world has been designed beautifully, and with easter eggs on each map, there is alot of potential for the players to move freely around. The weapons in the game let the player vary up the way they wish to play the game. For example, if you need brute force, you would use the rocket launcher, if you want rapid fire, you use the flask cannon. The Dev's really made it friendly for however the user likes to play. Not to forget about that it is VR compatible, it makes it all the worth wile (I don't own VR myself, but other videos suggest this)Overall, I do love this game, which is why I highly recommend buying this game."

This game is good for VR but bad for a desktop PC. As a non-DK2 owner I can only give it a thumbs down. Maybe the devs should have just waited for the Oculus Rift to come out and publish the game then. On Steam and desktop this game is somewhat out of place.It's like a shooting range, where you shoot at moving cubes and run around a small area for a better shot angle. The innovative part is that you do this 4 times per level, and each time you do this you are recorded, so next time you will see your own copies doing what you did last time. With the efforts of all your doubles combined, it plays like a co-op game. Sounds fun, right? Well, it is for a short time, just don't expect too much.Usually you will shoot a portion of the enemies in one run, another portion in the second run etc. Or, since it's all pretty casual and you won't plan much, you will just shoot what you can in the first run, then, recalling what you had difficulties with (like the tough yellow cubes), you focus on those in the next runs, maybe also guessing which weapon will be best for the situation. You also run around collecting loot (small dots which make a typical ""score"" sound reminding Mario-like 2D platformers). For the coins you buy straightforward upgrades for the weapons (more damage, faster firing, more spread, faster rockets etc). The game feels like an attraction in a theme park where you compete with other visitors to win a teddy bear for your girlfriend.There is even a level designer but it's awkward to use on a PC since it's obviously made for people wearing a VR headset and struggling with its limitations. The graphics are bright and feel casual. The music is disco-style; it's good but somehow it adds to the game's shallow feel. The levels are pretty varied, struggling to postpone the rising boredom. You may want to play it 15-20 minutes in a session when you are waiting for something - much like a mobile/flash game."

If they don't add more features to the existing game, I certainly hope there is a more fleshed out game as a sequal. A full FPS campaign, with enemies that shoot back, and a story, built around this awesome mechanic, could be one of the best games of all time.That said, it IS a pretty basic game. Some arcade like shooting gallery levels, and user generated content for longevity. You will inevitably find yourself competing with yourself for a better score on past levels after the first few hours. For the price point though, 4-5 hours of great fun is totally worth it.

I would have liked an endless mode where you have to get a certain percent to not lose a life4. and a few more offical levels.Overall a great game to check out though a easy one

I took a long break from it and came back, only to my surprise, it seemed better than before! Anyone who is into controlling their teammates, instead of shouting at them, or is generally interested inf FPS games, i would definitely recomment this game! It is very well priced, even a little cheap, for what the game is! 10/10P.S. Does anyone have a clue to the story behind this game?? I just have this feeling that there is something much deeper going on, rather than just strategic shooting. If you manage to get out of the starting map area, you find yourself in a tower, and to your right, is a very odd and interesting picture. A large foreshadowing, or a story untold?"
,Not Recommended,270010,12678994,"Posted: 29 October, 2014",all,s0lidus,Updated Jan 2017:This was hands down my favourite game on the Oculus Rift DK2 but the author has unfortunately shown zero interest in updating it for any of the consumer VR headsets. This is really very sad since it really was amazing. I miss it. :'-(DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you are using old (pre-consumer) hardware. It won't run.If the author sees fit to update the game for new hardware I will change my review.
