It's not complicated, it doesn't demand you to teach dozens of combinations (recipes, spells, dieties of Gods, etc.), it is quite dynamical and fun. You progress really quick. You can find an arsenal in a single chest, or you can travel plenty of rooms with a stick and a lid. I was INVINCIBLE!!! I had like 10 skills learned from looted book, but then... A boss happened. Anyway, the game may need some more feats and content, but for a $3 coffee brake Roguelike it's fun as is. I'd give it 4/5 in it's genre. Thank you for your attention."

I can munch on my beefy-5-layer burrito while simultaneously pointing and clicking on bad guys and collecting loot! Imagine the most generic dungeon crawler possible, and you've probably imagined something similar to Quest of Dungeons. A loot-hunt, a maze of randomly spawned rooms, baddies that drop gold, hooded merchants who will buy everything you have without question ... Quest of Dungeons just might be a dungeon crawler in it's purest form. This game accomplishes it's intent save for a few exceptions:1- The bosses are slightly imbalanced throughout the game. On the first level, they will one-hit kill you, on the seventh, you will one-shot them from across the room. Somewhere in the middle you will encounter bosses at about the right level.2- The randomized levels have a chance of ruining your game. I finally made it to the last level on my third play-through, and what was immediately behind door #1? THE FINAL BOSS! I discovered later that the final floor has it's own unique bad guys and rooms to explore. So beware, lest the final boss is at the foot of the stairs."

Unless you are really stuck on the 8-bit art style, I'd instead go with Wazhack or Sword of the Stars: The Pit, both of which are excellent. OR try Hammerwatch if you want live-action roguelike as opposed to turn-based, which this is.Here are the pros:1) A little humor in the game which is mildly amusing.2) Scratches your 8-bit nostalgia itch, if you have one.3) The music tracks are cool if you like 8/16-bit MIDI tracks. I quite like them personally.Here are the cons:1) Waaaay too easy on normal difficulty. Only the boss fights are hard. The rest of the time you will rarely if ever need to use your special abilities. Overall gameplay is fairly simple compared to some of the other rogue-likes I've seen.2) Loot system and the game in general is not well balanced. You gain skills by acquiring skill books. These drop way too often, so by level 3 of the dungeon you've already acquired all the skills for your class.3) There are ONLY 7 LEVELS for this game. VERY short for a rogue-like game.4) Generally uninspired and derivative. Absolutely nothing new is introduced to this ancient formula. It's been done better many times before.Basically this game feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The devs did not pour there heart and soul into this game. It is paint by numbers. And the painting is pretty sloppy at that."
,Recommended,270050,11142275,"Posted: 8 July, 2014",all,dema,"Quest of Dungeons is an incredibly fun game, that is very addicting, and more than worth the price.Following suit of classic dungeon-crawler games, Quest of Dungeons provides humorus lore, randomly generated dungeons with plenty of rewards, a simple-- yet effective, currency system, a multitude of themes and matching monsters, and one of the best game soundtracks I have in my steam collection.With it's perma-death system, many gamers would be cautious to pick up this title, but upon playing it I  can assure you that it only adds to the thrill of the game. When you get stuck between a boss and its minions, and are lacking a health potion or two-- it requires ciritical stratigizing to heal up and return the damage without dying, and will hold you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out the best way to go about a quest.Speaking of quests, they are the one thing that I find lacking-- somewhat ironically, in Quest of Dungeons. The lore behind this game is very humorous, and I find myself laughing at the premise of the title-- which essentially is to kill an evil sorcerer/tyrant/thing, to restore the good in the land. The storyline is vague, and very satrical at it's own expense. However, in-game quests lack any real reason behind them-- ironic or otherwise-- and while they do provide an exceptional amount of gold and XP, I find them somewhat boring to complete.In the end, I found Quest of Dungeons to be an excellent title that I would reccomend to anyone who doesn't mind restarting their game and thinking critically.9/10 overall score."

Can be done in 30 minutes or less if you are good and lucky.Did I mention Permadeath?What makes this game a challenge beyond the randomly generated dungeons is Permadeath.

,Not Recommended,270050,9669920,"Posted: 29 March, 2014",all,Duality,"Unfortunately I can't recommend this game. It's not a bad game, particularly in terms of polish. It's finished, it works, it has a proper structure... But it's very, very low on actual content and challenge. The game is easy, gold is utterly meaningless (therefore shops are essentially just an item creation menu, because you know you will ALWAYS be able to buy anything you want at them at all times) and it has no real storyline... though thats normal for this genre at least. You'll learn all your spells within about 10 minutes, your level doesn't really matter (there's no other progression either), items are all boring with no visual effects and they rarely even have extra stats making it a game where you just look at one green number to choose all your gear and by the end i didnt remember even a single item I had on.The upside is the game is fast and you can finish it within 30m (so sayeth the achievements, I suspect faster is possible) so if you want something to play in short bursts its good for that. But with so little content I find it hard to believe you'd want to play this much. People are mentioning this being a port of a mobile game, if that is true it certainly would suit that format and I'd actually recommend getting it mobile if that's an option instead. It's a game for thumbing at on the bus or in the bathroom, not fullscreen sit-down PC gaming.So don't buy it. Not unless it receives a big patch. The potential for a really solid game is here if only it was utilised. Then again, it was released days ago so I do hold out some home we see more content coming."

It is brainless entertainment, really good if you are ill, or tired or don't want to think too much.It doesn't have lore, nor tactics, nor a story, nor does it look great, it is repetitive, but it is just plain simple hacking monsters and some bosses untill you reach the downmost level of the dungeon and slay the final boss.It took me 4 hours (with two restarts as you die permanently) to play through chapter 1 (there seems to be another chapter), which is 1,25 euro per hour, about half a cup of cappucino. The dungeons are generated randomly, so if you are looking for a lot of careless entertainment, it should suffice.Great if you lack energy, or lack time."
,Recommended,270050,14267432,"Posted: 31 January, 2015",all,Glitched Being,"An underrated gem.To tell you the truth, I found Quest of Dungeons by accident here on Steam, while I was looking for some new games to play. And I'm glad I found it! At first, it may appear to be just a simple game, but there's a lot of depth in it.The drop system is great, and you just drop gear for the hero you choose. So, unlike many other games, you can't drop an exceptional armor/weapon that you can't use. This helps a lot.Some people may dislike the skill system, because you don't learn new skills by levelling up, you have to drop books to learn them. On the one hand, it's a totally random drop and you may only find the skills you want later on in the game, on the other, you can never drop the same book of a skill that you already learned (only if you already have a book in your inventory that you didn't used to learn the skill, then it can drop the same skill book). I personally liked it.One minor complaint I have is that I found the game to be kinda easy, even on the hardest level (Hell mode).Overall, Quest of Dungeons is a solid game. Totally worth it even at full price."

It's not to be taken to seriously, but when you realize all of the subtle nuances of it, it makes it far more enjoyable. The level progression and procurring nice loot, weapons, and armor are taken into account, the game really comes alive. It's not for everyone, this game appeals mainly to the oldschool.

It's a simple dungeon crawler that you can choose to play for ten minutes then put it down and come back another time. The game has a nice sense of humor about it, the music is nice but it could have used a few more tunes.Don't go in expecting QD to ADOM or Moria, if you do you will be disappointed.

The object of the game is simple, DON'T DIE!. Navigate the dungeons killing monsters, gaining exp, and collecting loot. You can switch out your equipment but leveling up just gives strait stat boosts. Skills come in the form of tomes you find. Some skills work better for some classes than others. The dungeons are randomly generated and can have multiple stairways. Some of the doors take keys to open them and there is no garantee that you will find that key on that floor. Backtracking to open a door on a previous floor might not be worth it since loot matches the floor you are on and not your level.Pantsu's Rating (out of 5)Graphics: 2.5 Nothing special here. 8 bit characters and monsters. The map shows what keys you need to get through the locked door but sometimes they are hard to see.Playability: 3 With WSDA movement and some changeable hotkeys you are never confused on what to do.Fun: 2 Perhaps it is because I chose the archer for my first run, but after the challenge of the first boss I didn't have much problems. I only died because I gave up caring. The game also trolls you right at the start with a sign showing a skull. I clicked on it looking for lore, instead found instant death.Sound: 3.5 Even though the game is in old school graphics they actually tried with the background music. Different tunes play when you enter certain rooms and floors.Replay Value: 3 There are 4 classes to play so there is some replay by challenging yourself on how far you can get with each class. Plus randomised maps and loot make each attempt a little different.Final Score: 2.75Final Thought: At $4.99 definitely wait for a sale. I believe I got this game for 49 cents."

I stumbled upon this game and decided to give it a shot for 5 bucks. Let me just say right now... WORTH IT. I spent nearly 2 hours straight playing it after I finished the 2 minute installation. The fight mechanics are pretty good, if not a little over-reactive with the mouse controls (I sometimes end up unintentionally moving when I click a tile with a monster on it as an assassin) but for 5 bucks it's certainly not a bother to me. This game is really well done for the price in my opinion, and I certainly hope this becomes popular. I imagine this as almost a turn based Binding of Isaac, with equipment you can switch out as opposed to just stacking more on or overwriting it accidentally. Having multiple classes is also a plus, though I have only played the assassin. My point is, if you have 5 bucks in your steam wallet thats burning a hole in your pocket; give this game a chance because you just may fall in love with it."

Why?Because this game is still inbalanced!Why collecting gems to sell them later for 12 gold each, when you just can hold on to those books with your skill spells? After completing half of floor 1 I had all my skills, but those books kept coming. So I collected them. With over 5.000 gold per book and dozens of them to sell I am rich now. And bored.Being a completionist I killed all enemies in floor 1. Now I am so strong that I just rush through the rest of the rooms. I can't say what the game is like after floor 2. Because it is too boring to find out. Everytime the same thing. Go into a room, kill the enemies with 2 punches and then the fiddling with your inventory. Why should I carry so many items, when I can buy some potions (stackable). Compared to the food items (non-stackable and less health-giving) these are the best. But in the case of beeing -that- rich: Why having those stupid food items which just overload your inventory?!So you try to keep vour inventory clean. Which is hard work! Why? Because if there are some items on the ground, for example 5 bottles of water and a piece of armour and you just want to collect the armour, you still have to pick everything up, when the armour is on the ground and the bottles above.Every enemy has the same schematic of fighting, the A.I. is also boring as hell - Which isn't exactly true, because I think that being tortured in hell would be more exciting than playing a game which is very, very, very, very, very easy.

,Recommended,270050,16951880,"Posted: 8 July, 2015",all,The Semp,"Quest of Dungeons isn't the most complex Rogue-like you'll ever play. It lacks the in-depth skill system of a game like Dungeons of Dredmor, and from what I've seen there's only one kind of trap, and what it does is spawn more monsters, which isn't necessarily a bad thing when you're trying to grind out a little more XP. And yet, even though its simple, and at times just a tad bit bland I still find reasons to recommend it.Perhaps it's because QoD is so focused. You have four classes to choose from, and there's nothing in the way of stat points to allocate. You can loot and equip items but the stat system for the randomly generated loot is easy to read, and so for those who aren't theorycraft extraordinaires knowing how to build a character is as simple as making sure you have level appropriate gear.The focus then becomes knowing when to use your skills and keeping a supply of food items and health potions to keep yourself alive. There is a quest system in the game, but there are only two types of quests: Kill enemy X, or Find item Y. There's a definite necessity to complete these in order to keep up with the escalating level of the dungeon enemies from floor to floor.The game does feature four difficulty levels, and there is supposed to be an update soon which will add a new dungeon. The game is not devoid of content but much of what is there is grindy and similar. For some that will work (I like to play this game in between sessions of hardercore, more mentally taxing games) but those who seek something that will constantly crank up the Wowfactor and throw lots of curves at you might fair better looking elsewhere.I'd recommend this game to those who are new the sub-genre, or else can't stand the complexity that some of us masochists relish in the more hardcore rogue-likes. Those who have already defeated Dredmor a few dozen times and completed Nethack a hundred times over might want to wait for something more complex to come along."

You're actually a little scared to see what you might come up against, you have no idea how strong you are in comparison to the monsters you know are there but are yet to see.No idea what any of your stats mean or what any items do that you may have been fortunate enough to find early on, there are interesting looking tiles and things everywhere so here is the biggest thing you'll be doing off the bat CLICK EVERYTHING that looks at all different from the normal tile you see.In fact in the very first room there's a signpost you might want to click on and check out... :3Since that's such a large part of the games experience (IMO) I won't say much more but, go everywhere check everything and be careful! You're sure to enjoy it regardless c:[Design changes I'd like to see]I love this game, but there are some things design wise that I think should be improved. You should be able to move your items around in your inventory at will imo since there are so many items that need to be sold at points, organising this would be majorly helpful. I also think that entrances to new rooms on the map should be marked as a different colour since its quite easy to miss if you aren't looking at it every 5 seconds. Only once you're looking back over a floor do you suddenly see you may have missed or forgotten about a few rooms.Also I'm sorry but I have to question why you're only allowed one save file... What if I want one file per class/character? Can you not give us at least 4 slots? I don't want to have to come on and commit to one class every time and only be able to change it once I die :CAnd what about a 'graveyard' of sorts, or a 'hero's plaque' where you can choose to record your past characters exploits after death ^^Final Thoughts:I don't know if anymore will be added to the game but I'd certainly buy DLC if it were available X3, maybe I'm a sucker, but Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is like the same genre, and I was 100% addicted to it AND it's sequels, if there were more content in this... wellIwould love it at least <39/10-MeGN ''It's decent''8/8-MeSpot ''Not perfect, but as close as any human can get''2/10-MeCritic ''We loved it!''"

,Recommended,270050,9698171,"Posted: 1 April, 2014",all,puppychow,"Quest of Dungeons is simply fun.  The game doesn't wow you with its retro style graphics, or overly complex game play.  You're given a choice of 4 heroes, each representing a different style of play (melee, magic user, archer, or fighter/mage combo), a difficulty level (easy, normal, hard), and you start crawling through a randomly generated dungeon.  Your goal is to navigate your character through the levels to reach the bottom and have a showdown with the final boss, the Dark Lord.The character is controlled with simple arrow keys to move up, down, left and right.  The two icons on the lower right allow different attacks.  The ""i"" button allows you to pull up the inventory and character screen.  The ""m"" button pulls up the auto map.  The red and blue potion icons at the top left corner shows your current health and mana.  Your inventory is limited, and your goal is to stay alive while gaining levels and accumulating gold, healing items, and finding better equipment.  Every level has a shopkeeper to sell your excess or unwanted inventory for money to buy keys or items.The main issue with QoD is permanent death.  Once your hero dies, you gotta start over with a new game.  And do expect to die a LOT while you figure out how to fight the various aggressive monsters that go straight for your jugular.  You have the option to save and quit as long as your hero is alive.  But once your character dies, you can't reload from that save point.That being said, I was able to finish the game on easy mode with a mage in 3 1/2 hours.  For a gamer who manages to finish a game once every few years, that is an achievement.  I may go back and replay in a more difficult setting in the near future.For fans of the rogue genre, Quest of Dungeons is five bucks well spent."
,Recommended,270050,9969220,"Posted: 29 April, 2014",all,Ishraqiyun,"This one's a bit like 'Dungeons of Dredmor' but on speed. You select your class of hero, each recalling the 8/16-bit sprite design of Final Fantasy characters, and plunge directly into the evenly tiled and sparsely furnished dungeons. By selecting a a tile (all the control is straight-forward and quite standard), your character dashes there, revealing the surroundings and leaving the rest behind cloaked in the 'fog of war'. Battling is either direct (square-to-square melee), or ranged (archery or spell-casting), and no one battle lasts more than a few hits, besides the boss battles that is.The dungeon maps are large but unvaried - this room connects to that room which branches on to two more, and so on. Occasionally you will need a key (or three) to access a room, and these can be tricky to find, or expensive to buy. Luckily, gold is left by almost every creature you kill, and also every wardrobe, vase or box you do away with. Items are given at just about the perfect timing, with the areas levelling alongside you nicely. Boss fights break this steady curve, and are often able to perma-kill you with one-and-a-half hits.The game is pretty charming, but is quite repetitive. When you reach a new level, you see new surroundings and new enemies, but they will remain as such until the next floor. In essence, each floor is its own stage, and sometimes the stage tends to outstay its welcome. I put this down to a lack of meaningful discovery. There's little mystery and only slight threat in each of the floors, and as said above, it is only the bosses that will pose any real worry. The special music and on-screen warning helps you from stumbling onto them too suddenly, though.It's a fun game, but quite simple and a touch repetitious. That said, the game is quite repetitious. Repetition is the game's burden. It's worth playing, but wait for a flash sale."

,Not Recommended,270050,10275061,"Posted: 29 May, 2014",all,sniggyfigbat,"Reviewing Quest of Dungeons is, in many ways, a lot like reviewing a unicorn. QuoD is, essentially, the ultimate 'generic Indie game'. Given the range and breadth of the so-called Indie genre, this should be impossible. Nevertheless, QuoD manages it. It's like opening your library to discover a mythical creature: something that, fundamentally, should not exist.At this point, I feel the need to stress,that is not a recommendation. The fact that it such a thing exists is marvelous, the game itself, however, is therefore not. It is the ultimate testimony to the fact that a great game requires more than a full range of acceptable elements.There is a great misconception that, if you just throw together a bunch of tried and tested game mechanics, with a sufficiently pleasing 'Indy-pixel' aesthetic, and some decent music, and brief if moderately amusing story, and then polish it all up a bit, you will get at least adecentgame. QuoD is this game, and it isdull. Every element of this game would prove perfectly adequate in another, better, indie title. Together, the result is far, far less than the sum of its parts.The game mechanics are generic as they come. It's like someone took the mechanics from the originalRogue, and then threw in all the standard RPG sub-mechanics that players expect today. Oh, and removed most of the challenge. Upgrades are linear (and dull), combat is simplistic (and dull), level design is randomised (and dull), items are generic (and dull). You get the picture. There is not a single idea in this game that you have not seen before, probably so many times you don't even register its presence any more. Fittingly, the game does not see fit to provide a tutorial. Perhaps it sees itself as a sort of 'Wiki-learning' game, like Minecraft. Such delusions of grandeur are utterly misplaced, but fortunately you don't need one, because it'sso damn generic.The frippery is, similarly, so generic as to be barely worth noting. It's got cutesy pixel graphics. Gosh. In an Indie game. Someone phone the ♥♥♥♥ing press. I guess the execution's acceptable, but it's, like everything else about this game, utterly unremarkable. The music? Well, I guess it's got some. It's not chiptune, so maybe it loses a little bit of Indie cred there, but it's dull, repetetive, loops over and over again, and is repetetive, so I guess that's nearly as good. What there is of it is fine, and it isn't actively obnoxious for the first hour and a half, so I guess that's OK. And the game has seperate audio sliders, which is useful, when you finally get sick of it. Finally, the story. Um... Not much of that. There's a tiny opening cutscene, and, I'd guess, probably an ending cutscene. I freely admit, I couldn't be bothered to finish the game. I guess the story's adequate to explain why you're doing what you're doing, but Spec Ops it ain't.So, the result? Look, I don't know if I've got the point across yet, butOH GOD IT'S SO DULL. This is proof that it possible to find an Indie game not merely lacking in execution but in heart. It's just utterly soulless. It's like someone took Realm of the Mad God and removed the elements that made it fun. The only reasons you should buy it are as a dire warning for budding game designers, and so you can get a really rare badge for your Steam profile.I can't hate this game. It doesn't have that much personality. I just resent the hours of my life I spent playing it."

No story at all, almost no text or cutscenes.Each floor works exactly like the last. Only the colors and the enemies change slightly.Also, all enemies are basically the same.

Your first ability will always be the main one. Most abilities aren't even subtle or interesting; it's mainly just ""deals more damage in a larger zone but costs more mana and has a longer cooldown"".

One of the the things I think the maps could benifit from is secert doors.I find the ballance of the game is good for the most part the only issue I have found is that sometimes it will place a boss right at the begining of the first floor which is hard on first levelers.I also like the fact that you can encounter your non winning characters as ghosts.I hope this helps.

It plays fast and intuitively and has catchy tunes and sound effects.Goal of the game is to get to the lowest floor (6 or 7), where you can defeat the end-boss and thus winning the game.You gain experience by killing monsters and completing quests as you progress through the floors. Mana and hitpoints (depending on difficulty level) can be regained by either ""wandering around"" (avoiding the word ""exploring"" in this context, because it's effectively possible to replenish mana and health simply by running around in already explored areas), or consuming potions or food. When having explored all of a dungeon floor, your level and equipment will be good enough to proceed to a lower floor with more difficult monsters and boss(es).Magic books can be found in chests and monster-drops, which you can read to learn a new spell. Each spell has a short explanation and is easy to memorize. Every spell has a cooldown period and mana cost.Gold is collected from monster-drops, destroying breakable objects, chests and or selling items at the shopkeeper. Equipment (weapons and armor) can be looted from monsters and bosses, found in chests or bought at the shopkeeper.Quests can be initiated by activating ""quest poles"", scattered around the floors. Basically, there are two kind of straightforward quests: ""search quests""; which require you to locate and collect an object or ""kill <name of boss> quests""; in which you'll have to find the boss' hideout and defeat him. While the overall approach of the game feels rather easy, the bosses can be tricky though... make sure you come well prepared. It's mostly the spell arsenal you possess at the moment that makes the difference between victory or defeat, this especially counts for the battle with the final boss.SummaryFun, fast, easy to learn, easy to master; therefore making QoD an excellent beginner-roguelike, no more-no less. For experienced roguelike-players, this game is simply too basic and too easy to be taken seriously into account. Even the hardest difficulty (Hell) it is fairly easy to beat.  When having achieved a perfect game (100% achievements in 18 hours), you've about had it with the game. For me at least, i can see no further challenge and/or the need to play QoD again (soon), therefore offering little, to none, replay value.My advice:get it if you want an introduction into the roguelike genre or if you're an achievement hunter and want to quickly add 18 achievements and a perfect game to your profile. If you own other roguelikes, play them or search for other ones, but definately skip this one."

You play the game in turns so everytime you move one square, attack or use a consumable that counts as a turn and your enemies can move or attack you in that time.On my first actual playthrough on the easy difficulty it took me about an hour and a half to get to floor 5 after exploring every single room and doing all of the quests, i had some of the best gear i could find when i went up against the boss of the floor, got cocky and didn't drink a potion, he killed me, again that was on easy the difficulty goes up to hell.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good roguelike game that allows them to just sit down, relax and click the left mouse button.TL:DRSimple concept, fun game."

Simple gameplay, with simple graphics, and rules with basic rogue strategies.   The downside right now as on release, is the GUI.  It could benefit greatly from an overhaul, as there is a lacking of hotkeys, along with cluttered inventory management.  Spell, and Skill selection consists of several mouseclicks to use, so setting up defenses, buffs, and attacks is a matter of 5 to 20 mouseclicks of manually selecting.    Also, was the lacking of passing time by standing still, which from a strategic POV, hinders you in battle if there is 1 square difference between you and a foe.  Even on Easy mode, there was a large gap in learning curve between dungeon levels.  Almost as if it could use a tad bit more game balancing for one or two classes.If you can get past some of the quirks, then it can lead to many hours of play.  Be warned, its a true roguelike, with perma death, so it may not be everyones cup of tea.   Its a simple battle of attrition to outlast each subsequent adventure."

But if you're at all familiar with roguelikes, just don't bother.This game lacks any real depth or strategy. Enemy behavior patterns are drop-dead simple and can be trivially abused (if even boss-monsters don't know how to chase you around a one-square obstruction without making mistakes and going the wrong way sometimes, expectations have to be set pretty low). Monsters don't have different speeds, or different pursuit-patterns, or even different immunities (even skeletons and slimes and golems and vampires and, yes, boss-monsters can be made to sleep with 100% success); they DO occasionally have different ranges and special-attacks, but that's it. It doesn't feel like an effort was made to have the treasure progression make sense; a few floors into the dungeon, you can sell inferior gear for thousands of gold, but the increasingly high-quality gemstones you find are still hovering between 10 and 20 apiece, which means the only reason you would pick them up is to make sure there's not another item hidden beneath them. Selection of gear could have been interesting, but this is another missed opportunity; few pieces of gear provide any stats other than the primary stat always provided by the gear-slot, meaning that choosing the best gear means just picking the highest number rather than making meaningful strategic tradeoffs. Any difficulty comes purely from the fact that some boss-monsters or special attacks can remove half of your health or more, but that's okay because if you know anything about tactics in roguelikes you don't have to let them attack you at all, if you play a ranged character and have patience.Graphically, the game delivers on everything its trailers promise. There's good variety in learnable skills, incorporating status effects and areas of effect in ways that would force you to make meaningful strategic decisions, if not for the homogeneity and simplicity of the threats you face. The music is varied and enjoyable enough and fits well with the game's themes. Overall, the game's production values feel decent for its price-- except for the deep, gaping hole where game-design and strategic challenge should be.Long story short, if you're a halfway-experienced roguelike player, you can jump into this game on its hardest difficulty, win on your first or second run, and have no reason to go back, as was my experience. With all of the noteworthy competitors in this genre, don't waste your time."

NOT EVEN WORTH $0.50 WHEN ON SALE!If you need to know why feel free to read on...Horrible.  Turn based RPGs may be my favorite thing ever but this....  Beat it in an hour an a half and enjoyed about the first 10-15 minutes.  I have NEVER uninstalled a game so fast (not an exaguration I've play hundreds of games and it was a first).  It is clear that ZERO effort went in to this game.  I almost never write reviews but when a game is this bad you just need to.  I will list just a few of the billion complaints I can think of.1.  There are like 8 floors and I got every skill in the game for my class (yes EVERY SKILL) by half way through THE FIRST FLOOR.  Every skill book there after was pawned off for lots of gold which I don't understand cause they are worth like 200 pieces of chicken but I turn over a rock and 3 of these books come tumbeling out.2.  Balance is non-existent.  I only played one class but with how horrible the game is won't try the others.  The shamens first skill will kill almost anything anything by itself.  Goen are the days are combining skills with other skills for cool combos cause hell I can just use Terror and they wont attack for like 7 turns!  How my severaly underleveled shamen was able to scare death (the final boss) over and over, shank him repteadly and then when he would wake up put him to sleep (probably the most combo esque thing i ever did) while I wait for terror to come off cooldown in 3 more turns is beyond me.3.  Enemies are all the same.  Almost every enemy is exactly the same.  They move the same but have different health and damage ratings.  All they do is melee.  A few guys shoot but those are the only other type and they just act the same as eachother.  I dont remember if bosses were the same as I would just ♥♥♥♥ing fear/sleep lock them (and set them on fire for fun).4.  First floor i explored everything.  2nd and 3rd I was bored and just wnated it to end but figured if I dint at leats get the items the bosses and merchents had I would have no chance.  OH HOW WRONG I WAS!  See I guess there were 8 floors in my first complaint but I honeslty don't know because I would enter a floor and leave it for the next one just a few turns later.  Sure the enemies were much more powerful then me after I did this like 3 times but I guess I can just be glad the Vampire Lords and Mummies are so afraid of me that they can't even attack.  Oh and did I mention potions?  The best health/mana restore items stack and take only 1 turn to use!  Gj almost one shotting me Death due tot he fact that I skipped 6 floors!  *sleeps then heals to full health*5.  But items are procedurelly generated like levels!  It is like borderlands!  that is cool right!?  NO!!!!!!!!  They have random stats and random names.  The only procedurale thing about them is the names vaguly remind me of the way you might put english words together and the damage values tend to be hiigher on later floors (that requires a very advanced algorithum you know!).  I did love the VERY RARE stat adjustments on items though!  Wait what?  What do you mean there is no way to tell what any of the stats do!?I could go on but honeslty I feel like if I havnt convinced you not to buy it (and if you already bought at least dont install and/or play it as it isnt even worth that) yet then you probably were going to buy it no matter what you read hear.

,Recommended,270050,15177164,"Posted: 2 April, 2015",all,Smurf,"Quest of Dungeons is probably one of the best ways I have ever spent £3.99The game play is one of the simplest you will ever see, You can play the whole game by just using your mouse or you have you the w,a,s,d keys to move if you so chose. The game throws you into the dungeon with no tutorial so you are going to find your self dying quickly but I think it this challenge of the game that make it so enjoyable unlike most games of today if you die you have to start again. there is a ""save"" but this is only so you can take a break if you die the save is deleted and you have to start again, This can be annoying but it also makes you want to play it again and again.You start the game by choosing one of four characters warrior, wizard, assassin and shaman then you are in the game. from this point onward your goal is to kill monsters to get money to buy better stuff to kill more monsters  and repeat. you do all this so you can get further down in the dungeon in a wild hope that you might really beat the game. alone the way you find shops to spend your money, random boss's and the odd chest if you're lucky. then from you lose track of your health and die. then you press new game and give it another go  and after a few 100 goes you might really win and then you will do it all over again with the other three characters.over all I think this game is one of the rare case's of getting more than you are paying for because than game is simple fun and something you can sit back on a lazy Saturday and play for hours not caring about the world and for £3.99 I don't think you're going to get much better. The only thing that I would want to improve in the game in small thing like  customs characters and making it so when I equip armour it shows up on my character it seems a shame it get a cool new golden bow and it now show up in my characters hand, but apart from that I cant put the game down great fun small price the way a 16-bit game should be."

Sounds easy right? No. For some reason the ""easy"" difficulty is harder than most games i find difficult to play. You get two-shotted by bosses on Normal mode and the only good character is the ranged one because they can't directly attack you from afar unless they are mages or archers themselves. You spend two hours on a regular run and you probably won't finish the game in this time because you die by the bosses since a crit does like 60% of your HP for some reason- and in higher difficulties a crit would end your run.Do i reccomend this game? Yes, it's so much fun. But only if you don't mind having to start over again. Basic combat that everyone can understand sounds horrible, but it's actually not that bad as it looks on paper and fits the game very well. The graphics are very nice for a pixely game and the music really gives a nice ambience, even while it sounds so... stupid?Trust me, you will spend an hour, die, probably not play the game again for a couple of hours or even a day and do another attempt on it the next day. You will try your *ss off so hard that you will ragequit over and over again, but you still want to see that booty when you finish the game. You will get really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when you open a door and a boss shoots at you or uses magic at you and crits you, making you lose the game. But you will come back. And you will pick the archer 90% of the time since you hate the other guys being f*cking more hardcore than hardcore hardcore. You will deny your gf for sex because you you are so far playing this game and you haven't died yet...Buy it.. Buy it now.. Finish the game for us so you can save our souls.."

But the whole game is always about: find one thing or kill that boss.Speaking of boss... Why so hard? You need to go farm the floor after just to get a few more levels before facing the boss of the prievious floor. Why?Melee characters are weak as fuuu compared to mage and rogue. Even rogue gets super weak very fast. I managed to get floor 8 with the wizard and died of a boss which was right at the door and managed a single lucky crit. Also, I don't know for the others, I had nearly one million gold before I died, and I never had anythingt good in shop beside once or twice I got a doom key (which are kinda rare) Otherwise, I always got mana potions because the mana regen ridiculously slow.Monsters in general are relatively easy to beat other than some floors where the difficulty increase very quickly (I think of floor 5 I think with the vampires)There is too many little things that irks me. It could definenately be better. Like some others said, there are better roguelike games out there. This one is decent but do not expect too much.It is only fun once you get the twist and to waste time. Nothing else (could be a mobile game, that would be a lot better.)"

My first run I tried out the archer who can hit anything he can see while they slowly creep towards him. As soon as I figured that out, I never got hit again. The most difficult part of being an archer is finding shopkeepers to sell all your loot so your inventory isn't full anymore. Not that you need any loot, all you need is  the sleep spell, which as far as I can tell puts anything you want to sleep such that it cannot act until you kill it, which is how i beat every boss.I played again as the warrior to see what it'd be like to play something that couldn't just kill everything before taking damage. I still quickly became a god, though I had to use health potions at first. Luckily I found the warrior's version of ""sleep"" within the first 5 minutes. Only this version is an AoE shout wth a 95% success rate which paralyzes everything until you kill it. However, this time I did not succeed on my playthrough. This time I walked into a room and was promptly frozen by some random non-boss mob, I couldn't move or heal or do anything but watch it slowly kill me after hitting me several times. As far as I can tell, there is a random mob who can instantly kill you from any range no matter how strong you are. The only thing you can do is not be unlucky, or just play an archer.I didn't try the other two classes, but if they don't both have the ability to at least instantly kill everyboss for free then they are severely underpowered. If you still feel compelled to play this, probably try either the mage of the druid (though im sure the mage has something and wouldn't be surprized if the druid did all the same.)The only thing I liked about this game were the graphics. That's actually what drew me to play again, something about them I us find very appealing. Even though the gameplay is terrible, at least it's fast paced enough such that if you don't think about it it's still kinda fun. I would however suggest you move along after looking at the screen shots."

I played a few rounds with different classes and my success with a character was entirely dependent on if I got a good spell or weapon within the first floor. Otherwise I found that as soon as I encountered a boss my options were reduced to dying. What really upset me was a play through as the archer. I got to floor 8 and I was essentially a god. I was mashing former bosses into pieces, and I one or two shot everything, and I was generally untouchable. Then I run into some weird mage, and it ♥♥♥♥ing one shots me! I'm fine with a bit of diffaculty, but that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. A one shot should never happen in a game like this where your ability to react to such things is minimal at best.I guess to sum up if you've got a couple bucks, and a couple hours to kill go for it.

I am going to go ahead and give my review because I don't really want to spend more time on the game unless it is fixed. Maybe with the beta that is out, but I could care less.  The game looks great and it has great appeal. The classes are fun to play, and the skill books throughout  the game give the characters a good edge. The main disappointment about this game is that the bosses are extremely overpowered, and do a good double the damage that you do to them. You also have minimal health compared to them. But they are also easy to kill because all you have to do is run around the sides of the room with them following you, so that you can heal. Pointless. A good solution to this would be that the only way you can heal would be a wait button, you hold it to heal and you stand there while stuff happens around you.Another bad thing about this game is that NOTHING happens around you. You leave the room, everything stands there with their thumbs up their butts. Come on, make them do something.While playing my first character I looked at the sign with the skull on it, and it killed me instantly. Pointless?I played a second character and walked around for a good while, beat the first floor with the boss run-away technique. Tried to go to the second floor and the game crased, erased my data. Just my cup of teaMade a third character, a warrior. The game gets pretty simple when you get the roar attack that makes enemies scared, because you beat on them all you want. I got to floor four I think, and then stepped into the stairs on accident, game crased and erased my data. Dandy.Edit: I have mad numerous more characters, almost all of them have died the same way, wizards freezing me continuously. This is absolutely ridiculous and there is almost no way to counter it.Needless to say, this game requires A LOT of work.1.) Fix the healing run, or make bosses easier.2.) Fix the crashing.3.) Make inventory stuff stack, it's annoying having 8 chicken legs in your inventory.4.) Stop the intro crap. I don't want to look at that every time I start a game.5.) Fix the spam freeze.6.) Make characters change with different gear. Maybe even make it more complex, instead of seeing the same art for two different swords.7.) Some sort of auto-save, cause the crashes cause erasing of data3/10But as far as I see it, the game is unplayable because of its unbalanced combat, freezing, and general annoyances, and I don't see myself coming back to play it anytime soon, and would classify it as an unpolished turd."

You can hit skip a turn (enter) but that doesn't auto repeat, so you would have to spam it far too many times (I'm talking hundreds of times). The best way to get your hp and mp back after fights is to run from side to side of a dungeon over and over againAlso above means that in boss encounters you can just kite melee bosses in a square and take no damage. Giving bosses diagonal attacks would solve this but would make them a lot harder so it's probably not something you would want to do.[FIXED]  movement keys auto-repeat almost immediately which I think he's done so people can treat it as a real time game although it's turn-based.

First of all, gameplay sucks. I played a lot of dungeon crawlers, and simply this one has nothing good in it. There is no character development - you will gain experience that will level you up, but you have no infuence on how it affect your hero. There are spells - a few for each character class - and some of them are overpowered, others aren't usable at all. The gameplay is too simple; what is fun in such games is finding best strategies, finding weakness in different enemies, and constant threat, but there aren't any of them. All this makes this game too easy. What is more - design should be kept fully oldschool. Although i like style everything is made, the animation of dying monsters is terrible. Imagine this: everything is made of really, really BIG pixels, yet, when monster dies, there is animation of rotating and rescaling it, showing full potential and resolution of your display. It just doesn't suit there.To sum up, if you want to play good dungeon-crawler, choose something else - good alternatives are for example Desktop Dungeons, or Dungeons of Dredmor. They will give you much more fun."

76561198047398357,Not Recommended,270050,12022050,"Posted: 8 September, 2014",all,StopSignEnthusiast,"This game is boring, uninspired, and poorly thought out. I get it, it's a rogue-like/retro/classic RPG with a snarky attitude. It's also just plain bad. The original ""Rogue"" and its character based followers are superior to this game in every respect. But I'm not going to try to wax poetic about why this game stinks. Let me just give a clear list of points that illustrate, very plainly, why this game is deeply flawed.1. You and everything else have the same move speed. That means that you each move (or preform one action such as attack, open door, drink potion, etc) per turn. The problem with this system is that when you are facing a fight you know, mathematically speaking, you cannot win, you may as well just restart the game then and there. Why? Because you aren't going to be able to out damage what you're fighting and you cannot run away either. Because everything else has the same movement speed, anything that you fight will follow one space behind you... forever. They will chase you through the entire dungeon, always one space behind you (did I mention there is no actual animation in this game either. Just sprites moving along in linear motions along a grid? Yeah. Even NES RPGs had some semblance of animation, but not this ""retro"" release. But I digress) and when you stop, guess what? You're gonna get hit and die.2. Health and Mana slowly regenerate on a per turn basis. What this means is that after you've cleared a room, you can just spam WASD (moving one space=one turn) and pace around for a little while, to get your health back. It will regenerate to full, if you are patient enough. It doesn't take long enough to be a great nuisance to do, but it's not so quick either that it's not annoying. The main issue with this though is that it completely makes the inventory system, complete with food, health and mana potions, totally useless. You don't need to drink or eat anything because you'll always just be able regain health and energy after you've completed a room. As for actually using the potions and such in combat? That too isn't really practical because anything that you're fighting that you'd need to drink a potion for is going to kick your♥♥♥♥♥regaurdless of how much you drink. That's the biggest problem in this game. You're either gauranteed success or failure the moment you walk into a room. Either way it's just as boring.3. The actual combat is really boring. For the wizard you're always going to be better off using your spells but your mana runs out. But, again, that doesn't really matter because you can just walk around for about a hundred turns (so about 20 seconds) to get all the mana and health you lost back. The knight is just awful. All you can do is hit stuff and then let it hit you, walk around, get back health, repeat.I think I've made my points very clear. There are still a few bugbears though. For example, there are bear traps scattered throughout some of the rooms. Why? No reason. The player can easily avoid them, the enemies can't knock the player into them nor can the player use them to his advantage. Why are they there? No clue, but it's just a little aspect that really shows how little thought, effort, play testing, and just plain common sense went into this game.This is an absolutely boring, cliched, uninspired game that still somehow thinks it has the right to mock the player on death (such as flashing ""Seriously?"" and ""Let's just pretend this never happened"" in red when the player dies) and ask ""leaving so soon"" when trying to quit the game. Yes, I am leaving and I will not be returning. If this were just a little flash game on Newgrounds or whatever, I'd take it as a budding game maker spreading his wings and getting his barings in. But charging actual money, no matter how little, is rediculous. Take those couple of bucks this game costs, go to a McDonalds, and get something to eat off the dollar menu. Trust me, that alone will give you far more joy and satisfaction than this game ever could.1/5, the only redeeming value is that the music is not totally♥♥♥♥♥♥"

This game is stupidly easy and has no business being called a rogue-like.Random creatures? Yep, the game has them. Of course, none of them are ever a threat to your character so whether they're random or all the same doesn't matter. Bosses are about the only thing that require any thought or effort (and the ones I met still never came close to killing me - they just required the use of skills).Random dungeons? Sort of. Yes, the dungeons are random, but they ALL follow the exact same pattern of hub and spokes. If you go out a 'spoke' you won't find any way to connect to the spokes next to it - except by going back to the hub.  You will NEVER find a circular route.  So, explore north, come back to the middle along the same path, explore east, come back to the middle along the same path, explore south, etc. You will NEVER find a path that connects from center to north to east back to center.  A forced path would have been better - at least that way your not spending half your time covering ground you've already covered.Gems aren't worth picking up. Their value is just too much lower than the equipment you find.If you're looking for a rogue-like.. keep looking.If you're looking for a game that requires almost no thought to stay alive.. this might be for you."

Most of the enemies aren't too bad, but bosses are much more difficult.  Spamming arrows as an archer only works for a few turns before a boss is already on you, and then you're dead in about 5-6 turns, depending on how many potions you have at your disposal.  The pixel graphics are okay, but they could be better.  Enemies are pretty standard, including bats, skeletons, and vampires.  Nothing special and there are better rogue-likes out there."

The difficulty level is high and this game will punish you if you don't take it seriously. Since it’s a rouge-like, or perma-death, you start with a new character each game.Cons/Changes id like to seeThere are only four characters. Also they should have called the assassin an archer and just added rouge in place of the assassin (just my opinion). The classic character classes are covered, but I’d like to see more. Possibly characters rewarded for beating bosses (reaching a lower floor) or a character tree for each class that unlocks the more you play. You could add strengths balanced by weaknesses to fine tune the character (basically character creation).All in all this game is amazing, and I would have happily paid more for it. Give it a try!"

Well I feel a little slow because it took me 2 hours or so.  Content wise the game is good for about 6 run throughs.  First run to figure out wtf you're doing.  1 run per character (4) and then a final run to try the hardest difficulty.  That last run... may be more than 1 run...Graphics are exactly what they seem like.  SNES style.Controls need a little tweaking.  The default settings can get you in trouble so be sure to look over the options if you're thinking ""oh why wouldn't they do it this way instead"" cause you can :-P and they did! sort of...Sound I actually really did enjoy the music.  The sound effects feel pulled right out of SNES as they intended but the music feels golden age PS1.Story is... well it is present... technically.  They make some jokes and it's pretty good.Overall I liked this game.  Got a few days out of it for 3$ on sale.

,Recommended,270050,23966875,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,Neptunella,"If I am to describe this game, I'd say that Quest of Dungeons is charming in its simplicity. Gameplay is turn based, very laconic and, therefore, easy to get used to, but I think that this game still has enough diversity to keep you entertained. You have four characters (actually five, but the last one is unlocked after you've beaten the game for the first time), and due to unique skills each one of them has from the start and can learn later from the books, they are all different and playable in their own way. The dungeon you are to go through has seven floors with randomly located bosses, and, of course, the final boss in the end, but it is your choice - to thoroughly explore each floor or rush through them as fast as you can. There are also locked doors and locked chests that will require one of five types of key (or even two keys at once!), but some things are designed to make your life easier - like the hidden stashes you can find by just walking through a room, or fountains that can be used once and restore your life or mana. Another classic element - merchants, who can buy treasures you find and sell you potions, keys and armor/weapons.Of course, there are minuses. One of them is the quest system - there are only two types of quest, ""find something"" or ""kill the champion version of the regular mob"", and doing them is nothing but boring. Another minus is that, for me, the game was pretty easy, even on Hell difficulty.Still, overall I found it an enjoyable little piece, and for its price I would recommend it to anyone, even to those who are not familiar with roguelite games. It's simple, it's accessible, it looks cute and it can be great for killing your time."
