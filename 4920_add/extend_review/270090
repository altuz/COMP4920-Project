This makes it very difficult to see anything.On the upside pressing escape instantly closes the game so you can get away from it that much quicker.

,Recommended,270090,14285947,"Posted: 1 February, 2015",all,Maxmetpt,"//N.P.P.D. RUSH//- The milk of Ultraviolet is a very, very weird game! It's mostly a top-down shooter of sorts, with some light rogue-like and bullet-hell elements. It's a game that you can pretty much beat in less than 10 minutes, but it may take a couple of hours to understand what's going on and be able to beat it.Basically, you're dying. You've been in some sort of accident, lost your limbs, and are now attached to a motorcycle, with guns for arms. Badass, huh? Everything has a decayed, drugged feel, in a good way. Your task is to collect girls for an unknown purpose (later revealed), and try to survive while you're at it.You kill enemies that drop money, and you can use that money to upgrade, sell your organs (and be left bleeding out), buy girls, buy more time, etc. Have I mentioned it's a crazy game?ContextAfter Uriel's Chasm, Rail Slave Games seems to have become the developers whose games people just get for very cheap, and then do joke reviews on. While there are many legitimate flaws in this game, it certainly does not deserve the way people look at it as.I played his other game yesterday, and while I recommended it for people who owned it, and wanted a completely crazy experience, I do not think it is a very good game, even at its core. The cryptic biblical theme didn't help either.With this game, however, while it's full of huge flaws, design-wise, it's also something very unique at its core, and I actually enjoyed it! Think dark Hotline Miami, on steroids. This is pretty much that, although in a smaller scale.I've bought it for less than 40 cents, and it gives you 3 cards, which you can sell for 9 cents each, so half of the game pays for itself.PresentationAlike their other game, there are steam reviewers saying the game'sretro lookis badly done and very ugly.Well, the ugliness is completely intentional, and it gives the game a very personal vibe, in my opinion. It's a weird mixture ofglitch and cyberpunk. It's gritty and cheesy, but it definitely sets the tone and carries the experience almost by itself.Mind, however, that the game has many faults when it comes to feedback, and part of it comes in visual form.This is because you get blood on your screen when you kill enemies (the one introduced after release doesn't, due to a bug...). This would look like you're the one being damaged.However, when you're damaged, the screen gets blue, and can often pass unnoticed.It's ... not good. You'll often die because you didn't realize how close you were to death. It's unfortunate...Thematically, it's very cool looking!Thesound-effectsaren't very high quality, but again, help to set the tone. Didn't find them very good at all, but hey...Themusicis also a mixed bad. It's mostly an amateur industrial metal. It'sverynoisy and low-fi, and I'll definitely not listen to it on my own time. Yet, it adds a lot to the experience. Most people will find it completely awful at first listen... the whole game feels like that. But if you can put yourself in the right mindset, you'll find that it's a very cohesive experience, design-wise, and thus creates a great atmosphere to visit for a short while.Interface and Options-wise, it's pretty horrible. Besides, half of the things do not exactly work as intended. Your preferences always reset when you get to the menu (either by starting the game, or finishing a run), the timer starts counting on the menu rather than when you start a run, etc. Still, the most important option for me was the game's volume (no separate sliders either), and that could be changed at any time, by pressing ""+"" and ""-"", so that's fine.You always have to click when the cursor is on ""back"" to go back. Many people, myself included, simply press ""Esc"" to go back, and that closes the game immediately. There isn't any sort of saving, so you may lose a few runs by mistake like that.Most of the dreadful first impression comes from this. The developer has said that he doesn't like making options menus and the like and wants to express himself. I can understand that, but the result is a game that seems to have be hammered together. And, for most people, it's definitely a big wall to their enjoyment, leading the the whole joke circle jerk around the developer.The game didn't feature any menu, initially, but it was updated after release to havesomeoptions. It was appreciated, but it explains many of the bugs. The menu exists, but the game hasn't been changed to accomodate it...Bottomline is, it's probably the game with the roughest edges I've played. The interfacing is absolutely awful, and the presentation very unpolished. Still, if you can get past that, you may enjoy yourself!Structure & MechanicsIn this game, you need to save 30 girls, spread through 5 floors. After that, a passage on the 5th floors opens up, leading you to the final Bossfight.It's a simple twin-stick shooter. You move with WASD, and aim/shoot with the mouse. The menus are the same.I don't know why people mention the controls as being bad. I thought they were fairly good. Sure, it does not have gamepad support, but it's no the end of the world.Perhaps people didn't notice that you're on a motorcycle, so you move as in such. It felt pretty good, to me!Besides, your guns have a very high rate of fire, and make the enemies seems like butter, at times.The camera is also very close to your character, which mayhindergameplay for most people. Honestly, I was waaay past that when I played this game. It's the kind of thing you can play for 10 minutes, be challenged, and then put it down.Each floor has a different configuration, and you'll have to learn their layout to plan accordingly. You have a time limit (which you can increase with money), so it's important to know where to go. The levels are also full of enemies, some of which have a very bullet-hellish pattern. There are only 3 enemy types, though.There's a shop in the begining of the level, and it's also your ""staircase"" to change floor. In the shop, you can buyoneweapon upgrade, time, girls, and then there are 2 things with a heavy penalty to them. One, is buying health, but losing time. The other, selling your organs, for a big amount of money. Time doesn't tick when you're in the shop. However, once you sell an organ, your health starts to decrease, as you're bleeding out.While the intention would be for the game to have a very subtle balance between what the player buys, it can be cheesed (haha, obviously!). While that may seem a bad thing (and yes, it is bad design), it opened up a speed-run competition on the Hub, where people are trying to cheese the game faster. It's amusing.When I first beat the game, I beat it normally, by using the shop only to buy the weapon and time. I explored the levels thoroughly, and collected the girls. It took me more than an hour to understand what wasreallygoing on, haha! After that, I cheesed the game, and half cheesed it a couple of more times. It was fun.The last Boss is in a small screen, with bullet-hell patterns. It only has one phase, and there are situations where you can't avoid to take damage. Still, I never died against it, and I'm not particularly good at these games... The Boss fight is also independent on the rest of the game, so no need to worry about health or anything else.ConclusionThe game is very, very imperfect, and really bad at times. However, if you manage to ignore that, and even the sub-par design, you'll be left with avery unique experience, and quite fun at its core, I've found! I won't play any more than these 2 hours, but it was almost free... Besides, if you're into getting into the highest scores, the game is quite fun to play with.For the vibe alone, recommended! Otherwise.. don't."

This doens't feel like something you'd buy on Steam, this feels like something you'd download from the internet for free. It's not propperly full-screen, the mouse-cursor appears above the crosshair, and there's no main menu.Secondly, it has a nice concept, but doesn't exectute it properrly. In an andrenaline-fueled top-down shooter where move at high-speeds, you'd expect to accelerate automatically, right? Well, in this game, you don't. You have to hold down the dirrection you want to go in.Thirdly,  this is mostly personal, but I was expecting a cyber-punk Grand Theft Auto style game where you could explore freely, but no.  Not only are you restricted to missions, but you're timed.It's quite clear that the developers of this game are competent, but they just didn't go for their full potential."

The game starts up with a set of unresponsive text panels that display and skip through way too quickly. When I realized they would move through before I could read anything I chose to skip through them but every click of the mouse would take a second or two to respond before going to the next pane.When I finally got into the game, lag spikes due to loading as well as badly positioned warp zones held back the quality. I'd rather play hotline miami than to keep playing this game. There were no transitions between screens, virtually no animations besides flickering fullscreen effects, and the HP meter drops to -1 often before giving a game over.To top it off, the windows volume mixer showed two programs, NPPD Rush (which didn't produce sound the whole time) and ""New Project""This game has virtually no polish and feels like it was hurried through.I expect more from a game that is able to get on steam."
,Recommended,270090,26140895,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,FavoR,"//N.P.P.D. RUSH//- The milk of Ultaviolet is a retro-styled game. As a top-down shooter, it is a fairly fun game. It includes a strange story-line which is briefly given to you at the start of the game, with the rest of the story uncovering as you play further. You're placed in the middle of a drug-infused city, as you attempt to destroy your enemies and save your drug addicted allies.The thing I love about this game is it's unique artstyle and music which accompanies the game quite well. Although this game is quite different, it has a very short storyline. The factor of repetitveness can sometimes make the game frustrating, especially with the graphics. The graphics are decent though the fast-paced, flashing colours make it hard to focus and concentrate on the game.The game seemed rushed, not because of the intended graphics, though because the gameplay was very short and tedious. It did bring a story-line to the table, and actually was interesting at times. It was a fun and short sit-down game providing a small burst of entertainment. The game can easily be played again, though after an hour of attempting to do it once, it gets fairly boring."

RUSH// - The milk of Ultra Violet is friggin' weird, man. Set in a hellish cyberpunk future, you play the dying, limbless head-and-torso of a Nox junkie, freshly amputated and installed into a police-issue battlemech and sent forth to rescue 30 unfortunate women from the industrial dystopia that is Nauseous Pines before your life support systems fail or you simply get shot to pieces by drugged-up mutants and murderous nuclear snipers. The setting alone was more than enough to get me interested, and the gameplay certainly sounded compelling, but the final product is a whole lot more unpersonable than I'd hoped.The game consists of five levels, each of which is filled with monsters, a number of women, and an exit that takes you to the next floor and offers you a chance to shop for upgrades. Killing opponents along the way earns you coins, which you can spend to delay the inevitable onset of time death, upgrade your weaponry, or rent a hooker for a health boost. More dubious services available include selling your ""excess"" organs for cash or getting a Nox hit, greatly healing you but causing your perception of time to get slippery. While there aren't too many enemies to encounter, the levels are randomly generated, so each game layout is at least a suprise. Unfortunately, that's exactly what you don't need in this game.The visuals are heavily glitched out, resembling an NES game undergoing severe and likely fatal errors. Each foe you kill smears the screen with an opaque haze of red; each injury you sustain stains the screen blue. Every encounter leaves you semi-blind and hoping for the best. Even worse, your field of vision is intentionally so short that you'll be blazing along at high speeds, only to crash into an opponent and take heavy damage. The reaction time needed to not get mangled is inhumanly fast, and since the game has a timer, you're not exactly willing to go forward cautiously. The interlevel shops certainly help somewhat, but money's a scarce commodity, and spending time killing every opponent you come across is two kinds of suicide. In the end it winds up being a manic, stressful, anxiety-laden experience, and the lack of any sort of unlockables or achievements leaves you feeling that your 30 or 40 agonizing deaths served no purpose. Admittedly, you'll get better with time, but the game is still NES-title unfair and actively tries to aggravate you into quitting. It's a neat little art project with some gorgeous visuals and an enticing knack for authentic old-school agony, but if you're looking for a game you'll actually want to beat, look somewhere else."

From what I understand is that you need to collect so many women to beat the game (forgot how many)... only problem is the entire game is based on a timer that constantly drains over time and when you get hit. Because of this, I can barely make it to level 2. I've even managed to clear the first level with no hits, killing all enemies and collecting all money and women, and still only have about 10 seconds left of time to play on level 2. Since this happens, I've been stuck playing the first level over and over and over and the game got boring super fast. *The screenshots on the store page only show Floor 1, and that's all you will see as well.The graphics look neat, but dear god I hate the SDTV Lines effect that this game has, and wish I could disable it.

RUSH// blew the mind out of my head, removed my limbs, and tossed me into the hyper-real clusterf##k of patterns and surreal violence that is Nauseous Pines. Now, MHLK 2.0 is Back TO KILL MY BODY.My first impression of RUSH was like taking a hit of:ENTER THE VOID, ROBOCOP, NAKED LUNCH, VIDEODROME, AND/OR BRAZIL while playing a glitched out SEGA Death.It was a thrilling, desperate, intensely stimulating, and sickening ride. The visuals, sexy, tiled, and multi-textured, made me feel like I was bolting through a cramped, neon and chippy glass tower of 198X excess. The parallax scrolling and layering effects gave off the weirdest sense of dimensional overwhelm. The details beg for careful observation and some kind of meaning, but there are urgent matters pulling you into the search for bodies. Memory strategies and knowledge are gained through your failures and experiments, and it all starts to make sense and click in the end. A tense pulling apart of the mind's pattern recognition software is ultimately required to reach and defeat Ultraviolet. The classic version can be found on Desura service for those that crave it's crazy charm.UPDATE IS LIKE SUPER HARD AWESOME MODE GAME:Installing the new version makes RUSH a totally revamped and extremely arcade like experience. You go way faster, hear louder music and more of it, kill more, face a more coherent and solidified challenge, and easily access upgrade shops from the start of each floor. You get brand new level designs, new graphics, new enemies and game mechanics, new presentation of ideas, and a new level of challenge. If you were perhaps turned off by the charming and quirky but problematic roughness features in the previous version, you will be happy to see that there is now a standard fullscreen mode, intro, menu screen, options and effect settings. When you die, you can start again without repeating the intro text. The new RUSH is a like a hardcore challenge mode. While the pre-patch version seemed to focus more on the mood, aesthetics and weirdness, the updated game focuses on action, speed running, and a smooth bullet hell gameplay experience. There is far less clutter and confusion, and more raw violence. The added CRT monitor, fatchip, and scanline effects are cool, but unfortunately I had to disable them by running in windows xp compatibility mode for my old rig to play without lag (Try running in 256 Color mode for an OLD TIMEY DOS feeling :) Overall, I feel the two versions are almost different games.

Sometimes you will be scavenging for enemies and junkies, sometimes you will be overwhelmed and, if you're quick, rich. The ability to move about the five levels freely is a false positive; you're always asking yourself if you grabbed the last one at the last level you were at, and, having to go search for that final junkie is killer. Literally.Everything scales well on a CRT monitor; looks exactly as it should. I can't speak too much on the graphics because of my weird setup and the nature of the game. If you're still rocking a CRT, you're in for a retro treat. Flatscreen 16:9? Don't know; hopefully it scales okay.This game is the price of a bag of candy, or a big box of Pop-Tarts. I can say that this is a much better value than either if you like twin-stick shooters. Or arcade games. Or if you ever had a Sega Genesis. Or if you're a person."

It seems like the entire development budget went into making it look like an Amiga game on a broken television and not a thought spent on actual gameplay, which is repetitive, shallow and buggy. The freakin' timer (which kills you when it runs out) counts down on the pre-load screen! You can Game Over before you even begin playing!It's difficult to tell what is an actual hazard and what is merely part of the trippy background, and you don't seem to have any mercy invulnerability, so you can take a massive amount of damage in a short period of time when your screen gets ""splattered"" with pixels, which it constantly will. The camera itself barely lets you see ahead of you, too, so if you try going faster than a snail's pace, you're going to run into enemies or their projectiles. For some reason, you use the keyboard to navigate the menus but use the mouse to make selections; but cannot actuallyselectthings with it until you've moved the arrowwiththe keyboard! It's also inconsistent, letting you use the arrow keys insomeparts and forcing you to use WASD in others, and of course, there's no key rebinding options, and hardly any options at all.The music is the only part that seems to have any semblance of quality, but even that feels like it's ""trying too hard"", and the soundtrack isn't included so that kinda negates it, since you're still gonna need to actually play this awful game. It's not very expensive, but even for the little I paid for it (with a coupon), I feel like I was overcharged. And if you buy this, you'll feel the same way too."

Do I sound like a pretentious old fart stating this (and all the below)? Probably, I do not care. I along with other dorks who still sit in the basement and play games made gaming what it was, made the classics ""classics"" and also helped inspire contemporary games of any salt, for the most part. So accept this fact and my word or bugger off, poseur.#2 Many of the ""classics"" from C64 to early PC (up to mid-90s before games started to suck bad), I have played and loved as an original consumer.#3 I like originality and creative especially pertaining to aesthetic - legitimate aesthetic - and admire some games that achieve this as well as stand on their own ground as unique visions.#4 This game is tough as nails (you can view the walkthrough online) - I dare you to complete it. Does this mean that it is a bad game? NO.#5 Is this the most legitimate true punk meets cybergame ever made? Along with the Trese brother's Cyber Knights RPG (Android) - ABSOLUTELY.#6 Am I biased or serving an agenda in some way? NO. Have I even emailed the developer to only be ignored and did this bother me to the point of thinking the guy may be a jerk, when he's on youtube and simply could have replied? YES.#7 Do I like this game? YES. Do I play it often? NO. Is is fantastic to put on once in awhile, get acclimatized to its bizarre environment and controls and give it a go in a gaming session? YES. Did I grab a copy of the posted walkthrough in my permanent vgame video archive - YES.Like a great trash cult film, the developer has made a real and true original cyberpunk cult gaming classic that is top of the heap, truly. Unsurprisingly when many cult film classics came out they were considered trash, unwatchable or crap. Time and appreciation tells another story. This is the ultimate cyberpunk challenge or even a torturous, bleak, dystopian coffee break game.I understand most games prefer another aesthetic or Green Day as their prefered poseur form of manufactured punk. I do not, and I constantly look for games in the weird or cyberpunk genres, this is a must --- even if you try to play it and give up due to its lack of instructions or confusion.

,Not Recommended,270090,14182805,"Posted: 26 January, 2015",all,celeste_ar,"I'll start out by saying that this game isn't as horrible as the reviews might suggest. But i still wouldn't recommend it.It is made by the same developers who brought you the infamous ""Uriel's Chasm"". That in of itself is a red flag. But NPPD RUSH is actually a whole lot better than Uriel's Chasm. it isn't exactly down there with E.T and Bad rats as many people would lead you to believe.But the game is simply too difficult and eccentric for the avarage consumer.Here are the main problems:-Barebones mechanics, No powerups or anything like that. Just WASD and Mouse1.-Camera is too close to the character compared to how fast you're moving, Making the time to react to a threat very slim. And enemies can also shoot you off-screen.-Art style is very cluttered and could cause problems for some-Game is timed, and the timer starts as soon as you launch the game. This means you can lose just by idling in the menu-Options only contain Volume slider and two toggles for the visual effects ""scanlines"" and ""chip fat"". No resolution or control options.-You're constantly being chased by a target reticle that will drop bombs on you if you stand still. The explosion animation of these bombs decays slowly for some inexplicable reason, and continues to damage you long after they initially exploded.This is very frustrating as there seems to be nothing you can do about it other than to avoid it. Even when all enemies on any floor is cleared, the reticle remains and continues to bombard you. As if the timelimit wasn't stressful enough.-Enemies can fire ""bullethell patterns"" simultaneously, Making their patterns overlap and becoming effectivly undodgeable.-Store prices are unbalanced, Buying extra time (1minute) for example costs 3000 in-game credits. Which is a way offset price compared to the rate you are gaining credits. Getting 3000 isn't really that hard, But 1 minute is simply not worth the price and effort. The same kind of ridiculous price ratios are present in other store items as well.-When you get damaged the screen gets covered in blue blood, Making you unable to see your character and potentially causing you to bump into more enemies, further damaging yourself.-You have to find 30 ""junkies"" that are spread out and hidden across 5 huge levels. And finding them all within the timelimit on your first try is next to impossible. The game therefore requires you to remember all the positions of the ""junkies"" and leads to a lot of trial and error. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, But is worth mentioning since trial and error-style gameplay isn't very popular.The Positive aspects of the game would be its experimental and eccentric vibe. It works if you look at it as a piece of art. However, that might not be something very sought out for here on steam, and would probably fit better on a place like Newgrounds.NPPD RUSH feels like an experiment made by an art student, which is not aimed to be an insult. But might put many people off.My recommendation would be to ONLY buy it if it's on a huge discount and you're intruiged by the concept. EVEN after reading this review."

The graphics are very unclear what is background and what's an actual object, and also what enemies are, or backgrounds are, or what's you're looking at. Its just kind of sickening to view and play.
