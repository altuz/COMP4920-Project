76561198010933023,Not Recommended,270110,19802931,"Posted: 20 December, 2015",all,ciceqi,"I originally bought this game while it was still in Early Access, long before it went to the pay model it adopted on release.  And to be honest, I'd already uninstalled it before release because it was already a fairly tedious game not improved by the odd loading limitations of the world chunks.  I can't say I was enthused when I heard about the new pay model, but as the devs claimed the game was fully playable without, I thought I'd give it a fair chance.One thing I will give them:  the world looks much better now that it's loading larger chunks, or else loading them faster.  And the topography of the world section I've been playing in is much more realistic, whereas it used to just climb off into Escheresque directions at random.  Water physics is still confusing, where you think you're going to float, and sometimes you do, and sometimes you end up at the bottom of a ravine.  The 'village' you start in is rather charmingly constructed, at least.  And speaking of charming, the baby dragon is a nice touch.As to whether the game is playable without pouring cash into it...well, that depends.  Do you have a high threshold for tedium?  Because this has not changed.  To be fair, it hasn't changed one single bit--as far as I can tell, they haven't slowed down any of the processes from what I remember.  It's just that it'sexactly as bad as I remember.Your tools last practically no time at all, whether they're constructed of stone or iron.  The higher the tier, the faster it goes, but pretty soon you feel like you're spending all your time mining just to replace your tools so you can mine some more to replace your tools.  The dragon is cute and quite useful in the outset, but I already feel like I'm going to be spending all the time I'm not mining trying to keep it fed.  And in order to feed it, Icouldkeep giving it apples, at least until I run out locally...or I could give it meat from animals I have to run down to kill, while they're healing obscenely fast, so that I always need to hit them one more time than I should, wearing out my weapon quicker, which I'll have to--you guessed it--mine to replace my tools and restock my coal and build more furnaces to smelt a single bar of iron over four minutes to replace the weapon so I can keep my baby dragon from starving.  Or I could throw money at the problem.  (The ability to throw money at the problem is literally the only time improvement I'm seeing here from pre-release.)Yes, diamonds have been dropping in-game, but not fast enough that I feel like I can grind my way out of this.  On the whole, the game is just slow.  Painfully slow.  And I'm literally achievement-hunting a game where I'm waiting for potted plants to grow, but at least I can leave that up and switch to another window.  Considering that we're supposedly able to take or leave the new pay system, and considering that by choosing to leave it, this is almost exactly the same game I've been playing all along, I'm going to have to say that the same flaws that made me uninstall it the first time around are still present and have resulted in a game that's more of a slog than a grind.  With all the other sandbox games in my library (and with all the new ones coming out), I just can't see wasting any more time with this one."

It makes a mockery of Early Access games that update frequently and stay in touch with the community on a daily/weekly basis such as 7 Days to Die, Don't Starve Together, Starbound, Plague Inc... Etc.For the first hour of the game, it was interesting seeing everything from a new eye. But I later came to realize that everything is quite... Lackluster and unpolished. The quests are plain and boring, crafting is a bit of a chore and not very clear, the graphics of the world itself make Minecraft look like the latest next gen game, and the leveling system is dull, clearly either the devs were going for a money grab with the pixal-block genre craze, or I'm missing something big.Over all, I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone out there, the dragons in this game is merely another way to get your interest in giving them your wallet."

Back when this game was first released, there wasn't that much to do, it was in early access, the game had microtransactions, and originally the price was $10. The developers did listen to the complaints, and removed the microtransactions, lowered the price, and added lots of requested features that the players have been asking for.

But Early Access SHOULD be used to make people test the game, while the updates are coming. It seems the developer doesn't understand this though. Its been MONTHS without even a single update. The game works, but it has SOO many issues, and so many things missing that where promised, that I just lost interest.Now the developer is inviting people for a CLOSED BETA TEST. So... isn't this Early Access? Aren't we paying to test the game already? Why doesn't he release updates so that everyone who paid got this can test it?The way the game is, its almost unplayable. Early Access games are usually buggy and incomplete, but we at least get updates from time to time. In here, we don't even have that!As for the game itself, its a clone of Minecraft, but with some new ideas. It features RPG elements, quests and a more complex system. Its a good idea, really, but the execution is, at the moment, horrible. The quests are lame, and usually not fun to do. The construction aspect isn't as fun as Minecraft, and the RPG elements need a WAY better implementation. I don't recommend this game as it is. Its one of the most incomplete and nonfunctional EA games I've ever seen, and the lack of updates made me doubt the developers are even taking this game seriously.EDIT: I'm not gonna change this review based on the Beta patch, because I'm gonna wait until the game is finally released.

That's probably what the developer of this game must've thought.I suppose you could create stuff in the game similar like in Minecraft but everything here just feels off. Obviously all the NPC's, dragons, other creatures... which are higher res, simply do not fit in the world. Besides that, the UI feels and probably IS like a casual game.Block Story has been in Early Access for almost a year now and there are almost no updates. It seems to me like this game is build in a hurry just to earn a quick buck, obviously without any love for games.After reading some of the other reviews I found out there's also (going to be?) microtransactions, which is just silly for a game like this, especially since the game is still 10 bucks, which is way too expensive.

76561198083470320,Not Recommended,270110,9947471,"Posted: 26 April, 2014",all,FractalRadiance,"I just bought the game, and am very unsatisfied with it already. ;( I want to like this game so badly, but I just can't, I even voted for it to get Greenlighted ages ago.My first gripe, is that when I encounter a hill, the char takes more time then nessasary to negotiate going up a simple block automatically. If you try jumping it to negate the clunky control, you either jump short and have to rely on the automatic manuvering, or both imputs are being considered and it's still slow as heck moving up a block.Secondly, the crafting window. Kinda cool how to craft you have to make the materials resemble the shape of the tool(i.e for a pickaxe, take wood and stone to make a ""t"" shape, Terriara did this too in the beginning) but making stacks of material and moving them around are a pain! It took me multiple clicks to get the game to recongnize that I was trying to pick up items to move around in my inventory. And then, either I picked up the whole stack, or none at all!! I tried playing on a different computer, thinking that maybe it was my mouse/keyboard, but still the same issue.Thirdly, my char must have some weird aversion to water, because I always get stuck in it somehow, and die from lack of oxygen.Additionly, one positive thing I have to say about the game is the amount of detail they put into the mobs,npcs and sky. With that being said, the difference between thoes elements and even just the landscapes are HUGE. For the first time in my 20 odd years of gaming, just looking at the game gave me a headache(I know that is entirely subjective). Comared from looking at the sky( HD metor showers!=D) and then focusing back to the landscape is so jarring due to what looks like a child picking colors. The grass blocks are bright puke green with little texture, the sand is just tan blocks of blah-ness, and the water blocks are so very transparent with a extremely light blue hue. At night there are many random patches of bright electric purple and green that it's a hard on the eyes(and I play with lights on in my computer room) too.Speaking of NPCs, talking to each and every one is a slight variation of ""go kill 20 mobs and bring back the spoils"". Nope, no thank you half naked dude. I had trouble with the first mission of collecting wood from ""trees"". The reason why I put trees in quotations is that once you harvest the blocks from it, most will not be accepted by the NPC. The harvested block title has to just wood, not anything else. For whatever reason, I found a lot of palm wood and various other types, and the NPC wasn't having any of it. Having trees drop normal wood isn't a hard concept is it?!And lastly, I can glitch through blocks and see for a good distance, but with no texture at all, just basic colors.I understand that at this point it's an early access game, and the devs need players input, but dang, one would think that a game would be more polished when relased to the public.I have little hope for the refund from Steam for the money I spent on this game."

You play as a guy with magic flying powers in a land where the enemies are actual 3D models that look like they were ripped from an old medieval fantasy game with poor sound quality and awkward timing for music that only plays for 5 seconds. The only difference is you can have multiple characters that carry over their inventory to other worlds like Terraria.The first thing I would absolutely LOVE to point out is this game is a mobile port. The first sign that it is a♥♥♥♥♥♥game. Second, I've been following this game for a couple years now, waiting for an update, but it never came, or so I thought. The updates did come out, but only for the MOBILE version. They haven't kept the PC version up to date at all! There are features being shown off on the dev's YouTube channel that came out on mobile devices that just aren't there for PC.Second, the controls are horrendous, due to being a mobile port, optimized for touch screens. Going from touch screen to a mouse and keyboard makes it really hard to move around in your inventory, proving difficult to grab only one of an item in a stack or seperate the stack in half.Third, the way they went about mob spawning is really stupid. They spawn on/near a specific block, rather than having the mob spawn randomly throughout the world or in certain biomes. It's also REALLY hard to find the specific mob you need to kill sometimes, so you actually need to check the forums for a seed to find that specific mob or NPC to give you that required quest.Fourth, the crafting is revolting. Combined with the horrible controls, in order to craft armor and shields, you need to gather a boat load of ingredients to put into one square, just to craft something that goes away after a few hits. You know all that time you spent killing horses for their hide to make that stupid goblin armor? Well, it just got wrecked after that bat bit your arm!FINALLY, these devs are kind of nice people, but they put it all to shame with their empty promises. I have had this game for around a year and a half and have waited and waited for an update that never came. This is absolutely unacceptable, even for an early access game. They have said the game will recieve an update, but they haven't released even a bug fix. It also seems to me that they may have abandoned this game completely because recently on January 12, 2015, they released a video on YouTube about ANOTHER game they are working on.

Like terraria). And seemed much more ""free"" to me.It was worth 15 dollars, honestly.Now it's the definition of trash, P2W mechanics, sorta bad storyline, and there are no spawners everywhere, meaning you have to face intense grinding torture where you have to go everywhere and wittle enemies with toothpicks to just get them to turn into a spawner.Not to mention, back then it was alot more better with the mechanics, the durability system was much better since it was unique; no green bar, but just that you had to craft a certain amount of the item and that would be its ""durability"".  It was pretty ""spawner based"", meaning you can alter what mobs spawn in an area and what don't.Now you have to have random things spawn in your house at times, pay to skip smelting too.Back when it didn't have the phone mechanics, like paying for stuff, was when it was the best."

Not to mention, Dropbox is great for backing up my worlds.From my experience with Minecraft, I can say I like this better. While the community is insane for Minecraft, there are things I like about this better.I play almost exclusively in create mode. I've found that placing blocks is a lot more flexible than Minecraft. This results in building structures that much faster. I can do things in hours that might take days in Minecraft.What needs to happen:This game has seen too little support. For an early access game, there needs to be frequent updates and additions. There needs to be more variety in blocks and furniture. Really, what the game needs is more content. I've hardly played Story mode, spending most of my time in create mode.The game does not seem to be optimized for PC, performing better on my tablet than even my PC. I have 8GB of RAM and still have to play on very low horizontal/vertical load to reduce impact on memory.I believe this game makes creation simpler than even Minecraft, among others, but needs some attention."

At first glance the graphics, AI of enemies and the story seem to be an improvement. However after a few more hours play, you realise there are far more limitations. Mindcraft is all about encouraging creativity. But the combinations of possibilities in this game are very disappointing. I am middle aged and tried mindcraft a couple of years ago just to see what it was about. I got hooked because of the games deceptive simplicity, but I have to say with no story/quests, mindcraft was ultimately pointless, except for the challenge of creating wondrous constructions. By comparison, Block Story has quests that are tedious (like going back 20 years in expectations). Characters and monsters (graphics at least 10 years old). Worst of all is the lack of array of blocks and tools you can combine. There also seems to be a many differences on the android version, but to be honest, that is not much better. If you want a mindcraft experience, try Mindcraft. If you want questing RPG, there are so many options now available. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS."
