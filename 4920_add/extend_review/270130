So I really, really don't want to give it a negative review, but I have to be honest.My co-worker owns a Vive, and I didn't recommend he buy this because it's just so short for such a high price. So if I'm telling somebody I know not to buy this, despite how good it is, I really don't feel like I should rate it any differently on Steam.The only problem is just that it's just so very, very short for such a high price. If that doesn't bother you, or if you want to support the developers and feel more like ""donating"" than ""buying"", then I encourage you to pay the price so that the developers can create more of this game. Just keep in mind that there is roughly 90 minutes of actual gameplay."

Specifically the Vive until Oculus Touch arrives assuming dev support for the Touch controllers.At a $30 price point for the time I spent in the game I would be hesitant to recommend this right out, but I think that the quality of the game and the polish I felt while playing it I would definitely suggest giving this a shot. Don't go into this thinking it will be like the old school point and click adventures as the puzzles are generally nonexistant and you rarely interact directly with any characters. Go into this for the feeling of adventure.Pros:-Looks and sounds beautiful-Great acting-Movement system pretty intuitive and with no motion sickness-Interacting with everything feels great-Feels like I'm in a movieCons:-Short, very short. Short enough that I am concerned about the price point.-Shooting flares was somehow the hardest thing I had to do in the game-Very subjective, but I wanted significantly more puzzles than I got."

On one hand I want to give this a positive review because it's a great gaming experience with some neat writing, fun ideas, amazing atmosphere and immersion, etc. It hits on nearly every single element a VR title should.Some gripes though....Why does the first video on the store page for Gallery spoil the entire ending? Like, I think they show every single segment that happens to close the chapter in that one minute video to preview their game. Seems really....Strange.30$ for a single episode of a multi episode series? Will this be five episodes? To finish the story we'll be paying around 175$ after tax for this product. Jesus. I mean....That's like a full fledged triple A product with the largest DLC bundle that'll be dishing out content for 12+ months to come....Maybe they'll be cheaper? Hope so.Secondly the content is short, I mean, really short. Don't let my two hours fool you, I started and restarted and started and restarted and spent like an hour in the main section of the game. I'd say this game could probably be beat in one sitting spending around 30 mins if you know what you're doing. Probably less.So for 30$ we only get the first episode (as bizarre and economically shady as that sounds) and hopefully enough excitement to sustain interest long enough to purchase Episode 2....Whenever it comes out and however much they charge for it (the fact I don't know these things is also disconcerting).I guess....Please just make it longer. You've kind of trapped me between my expensive new device and curiosity because I've already dropped money into your project. So, please make it longer and even offer different avenues and solutions to puzzles so the game can have a tiny bit of replayability.For now? Negative I guess, wish I didn't have to. I just don't have a positive feeling despite really enjoying the product, I think how they have handled that episodic system is really amateur and it leaves all of these early adopters who just spent thousands on gear standing yet again outside waiting to be let in with the hope and promise it'll be nice and warm when that time comes."

,Recommended,270130,23214982,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,Palin Freeborn,"I took a chance and purchased Call of the Starseed, even though it seemed a bit pricey for the reported length. I played it for longer than a couple of hours and spent a lot of time searching for things and completing some of the achievements. The inventory system is easily the best I've seen so far in VR, the camera repositioning/blink system is incredibly good (if slightly confusing at first and a little wiggy on inclines), and the graphics are very good at highest settings for a first-generation title.Having that said, I am a 30-year-old gamer and have been an ardent comic book, fantasy, and sci-fi geek my entire life. And what I experienced tonight in Call of the Starseed reduced me to tears when I finished the game. When the credits finished and the game closed out, I took off the headset and sat in the dark, openly weeping with happiness.I won't spoil it for any of you, but the experience was equivalent to being a child and seeing Stargate for the first time, at the moment when Jackson first sees the Stargate activate and walks through it. Or the first time you saw The Goonies and they found the bottom of the Wishing Well. Or like the first time you played Myst and were swept away by the fantasy of discovering the secrets of the ages. The elation and fear of the unknown, and the sense of impending adventure... it came crashing down on me so suddenly and overwhelmingly that I completely lost my sense of self.For people the need a TL;DR:PROS:- *Excellent* presentation- Detailed environments- Interesting puzzles- Voice acting, audio, and music are splendid- Inventory and blink movement systems are easily among the best in VR to-date- Achievements!- The beginnings of what promises to be an excellent and engaging story- No motion sickness during moving bits (Elevators, etc.)CONS:- Hand tracking will (very rarely) spaz out for a half-second- Blink movement will sometimes wig out on inclines or too close to walls, which can be disorienting- Short length, if you're rushing through it. (I recommend taking your time)- Pricey for the length, but it's VERY polished for a first generation title- Physics for loose, thrown, or falling items can sometimes be a little wonky.- Graphically intensive. Ran perfectly on 980ti at highest settings, might need to go lower with other GPUs- Accidentally forgot my in-game hands weren't real and punched myself in the face with the Vive controller while reaching for my backpackTL;DR: The first title I've played for the Vive that truly made me forget about reality and engaged me on such a deep level that it stirred profound emotions and reminded me why I love gaming. Absolutely worth your time and money, full price."

I'm hooked and I can't wait for the next episode.Where most VR games focus on a single mechanic or two, Starseed focuses on telling a story, and in doing so it manages to blend elements from walking simulators, puzzle games and classic adventure games without feeling scattered. There are a handful of clunky systems (interacting with objects could be unpredictable) most of their experiments pay off (I loved the backpack inventory in particular).It was worth every penny of the $25 I spent on it, and I say that as someone with a tight games budget. I'm a little stunned at the negative reviews. Someday when the kinds of experiences it offers are more common that price may feel steep, but for now this is a rare treat and I strongly recommend it."

This is what VR should be like. How the hell these guys set such a high benchmarks on what was really an emerging system is incredible. The story, acting, graphics, sound scape, immersion are outstanding. The in-game user interface, the backpack system all so clever and well thought out. Everything works. It's easy to get stuck on the beach but really after you solve it you see it was pretty simple. I just love everything about this game, it is short but it is so high on quality I don't really care. I hope Valve have their eyes on these guys for HL3 VR. Becuase you can easily see how they could pull that off after this work.

Although it's short, it's the first title with a level of polish similar to that of a triple A production. The first half hour will be spent like you are on drugs with you staring at your virtual hands, repeatedly opening then closing them while giggling uncontrollably. The inventory and menu system alone is worth the price of admission. Everything in this world you can touch, pick up and interact with. The eye for detail is simply astonishing.There's exploration, mystery, adventure, humor, puzzling and some tense moments. Call of the Starseed has got it all. The finale, the last half hour of the game, will without doubt provide enormous goosebumps. I've finished CotS in one sitting, took me about 3 hours and I'd say it was well worth the 30 EUR I paid for it.

On paper it's a straightforward adventure game but, if The Gallery is any indication, VR will be transformative for the genre. The hand tracking makes such a difference. For example, early on you're navigating some dark tunnels. You've got a map and you've got a torch. To look at the map you reach over your back to grab your backpack, get the map out, hold it up to your face and shine the torch on it with your other hand. While these interactions are necessarily a little abstracted (without any kind of finger tracking you're only really able to grab and release), they're enough to really draw you in to the experience. And it is absolutely worth being drawn in to.Regarding price, I don't have a problem with it at all. Maybe in the future when there are thousands of incredible 10+ hour VR games to choose from at the same price point I would think twice. Right now though this is an experience you can't get anywhere else. Compared to the IMAX, a football match or a theme park I think it’s totally reasonable. If anything it might be too cheap considering the limited user base and the high production values. I hope the developers make enough from it to finish the story.In conclusion, the game is great; please buy it so I can play the next one."

,Recommended,270130,22745732,"Posted: 1 May, 2016",all,Pengu,"Summary:Pros- Looks good- Immersive- Inventory system is fantasticCons- Cumbersome teleport mechanic compared to the teleport mechanic in other VR games- Overpriced- Short (1-2 hours)- Puzzles and exploration are the main focus of the game, but the puzzles fall shortIn Depth:This game is very visual, it tries to look good, and succeeds most of the time. There are only a few moments in the game where I noticed poor-quality textures or mesh clipping. The textures could be due to the fact my GPU is the minimum recommended, so it's not a big deal for me. The game ran fine, no graphical lag, no crashes.At the time of writing Call of the Starseed is probably one of the most graphically appealing vive reality games out, if you want to experience a nice looking game, this is your best bet, but don't expect the earth.The main pro here, is that the game is quite immersive due to the way it looks and plays. Another main plus point is the inventory system, I think it sets the benchmark for every other future VR game. Hands down. It doesn’t break the immersion, it’s easy to use, I just wish I could put anything in there not just key items.However, there are quite a few cons.The teleport navigation is bad, when so many games have done it so well, it makes me a little baffled to think what they must have done to make it so counter-intuitive. It’s like trying to drag a cat around. How you move your controller and where the teleportation target moves does not seem to be linked by any logic.Picking stuff up is questionable. Quite often I found essential or interesting items impossible to pick up. In numerous circumstances the floor was lower than my own, meaning pressing my controller against the floor would leave the item an inch from reach. This is not a calibration issue, there are different heights in some of the in game floors. There also seems to be a bug when in which you are unable to pick anything up if holding the magnet gun. No matter what you try to pick up, a vacuum tube will teleport to your hand from the gun. In general that portion of the game was very frustrating. Tubes got stuck inside objects and are needed to complete the puzzle, placing your hands inside one tube and trying to pick it up would pull up another tube to the right of it. You could argue this could be a tracking issue.The game is overpriced. It just is to me. I understand that a developer, or multiple developers worked hard on this and need to make a living, but for 95 minutes of gameplay, I paid £22.99. Which means I would be paying £15 per hour for something I didn’t even get 2 hours into. That 95 minutes includes credits and restarting areas several times due to item bugs. If the experience changed my life that would be no problem, but the game is 90% wandering and interacting and 10% puzzles. I only noticed 2 puzzles in the game, (ones that require you to think and work out the solution); both of which only took 5 minutes to complete. Which leaves this game drastically lacking in the gameplay department. Leaving the game a mostly interactive story experience, but for this beggining of an episodic story, there really isn’t much story to be had, and any tidbits you get are from listening to tapes. The final nail in the coffin for the overpriced status, is this game is Episode 1, that’s right, the game is episodic. I understand developers sometimes need to break up a game in order to fund the development process, but if people are not impressed they’re not going to buy the second part. By the time I finished the game, it felt like I had just paid for a lengthy demo. The end was visually spectacular, but that’s it.To finish. I had fun, I played it to the end, would I recommend it? Yep. If you don’t mind the cost. Which may seem counter-intuitive to what I have been saying.The fact is the faults of the game could be forgiven if the price was reasonable, and a reasonable price is subject to personal opinion. I will not be asking for a refund, for the following reason. I want the developers to take my money and spend it on the next one, use people’s suggestions to improve the game. I want to see a much longer episode, with more puzzles and more character interactions, but if it falls short again, I will get the episode refunded and wait until the game is a reasonable price.Also, the people in the game seem really really small."

Yes, the original price of $30 was pretty steep but I doubt these guys are pricing it that way just to screw us over or be greedy. They spent countless hours with a small team of creators  (not a hundred of hired hands) and created something beautiful for us to enjoy. I don't think it's unreasonable to want something back for that effort (so that they can keep working on more products!). You won't find a good painting being sold for less than a $100, so why not support these artists with $30? I'm just so tired of people complaining about artist's high prices because they are comparing those prices to mass production goods. They can't compete with those prices!

Every mechanic fits together perfectly.  The visuals are breathtaking.There were a few moments when I thought to myself ""WTF are they thinking, this scene is going to make me motion sick!""

The visuals (particularly at the end) can be breathtaking.Mechanically, it speaks the ""language"" of VR very well. Movement and interaction with the world is natural, and the inventory system using a backpack which you ""pull"" from your back when you want to access the inventory is neat.It's not perfect (nothing is). Graphics demands are high, with some juddering on my 6600k/Radeon 480 system, which mostly cleared up when I turned the settings down to low. There are some nausea issues with parts of the terrain where your elevation can change while you're walking in room scale, which can cause discomfort. The puzzles are a little simplistic, and the episode itself is not very long.That said, it's a wonderful first effort from this studio.

One, the way the camera adjusted up and down in height depending on what you are standing on is extremely uncomfortable with me and the only time I've experienced motion sickness with my Vive. Granted this is the only game that that has different Heights in room scale that I've played but if it's for immersion reasons I'm two floating hands that cast shadows, having my view locked to a height to avoid screwy motion sicknesses on each blink would be OK.Two, the price.

The story told is a launching off point to a bigger tale and delivers a satifying first episode; leaving me excited for the next one by the time the credits rolled.My only criticism is that sometimes I didn't notice the colour outline on objects and had to trial and error to see if it was something I could store in my backpack.  Perhaps more distinct/customized colour choices could help in future episodes.Also note that this game is definitely on the higher-end graphical scale, so you'll want to tweak your graphical settings to ensure you're not dropping frames.

The game has a very noticeable level of polish and production values, and the visual quality is probably the best I've seen in the Vive so far. There's a lot of things in the environment that can be interacted with, and even if something isn't related to a puzzle it can be a lot of fun just messing with things, like throwing beer cans at rocks and watching them fizz around or cooking popcorn on a campfire. As a first episode of a larger series, a typical playthrough will last maybe 1 or 2 hours, but it can easily go more depending on how much you like to interact with the environment. My only complaint is that the checkpoint system is somewhat lacking, and if you encounter a bug or something that makes you quit the game you can sometimes find yourself replaying a lot of gameplay, particularly in the longer early areas. But the game is so good that you probably won't want to quit anyways, so barring the rare glitch it isn't much of a problem."

On the way you will discover audiologs, do puzzles and play around with objects and the environment.VR technical:- The world is gorgeous!- When you get to close to walls, your vision starts to blur. At some spots it maybe starts to blur a bit too quick.- The ingame movement is a blinking system, you can even rotate your play area.- There is some automatic height adjustments which is quite uncomfortable. So avoid walking on and off ledges, but just blink. There was one point where I went to close to a ledge to look down and I sort of fell to area below. I had to take a breather to get back on my feet. (Devs try to look at these high adjustment mechanics because they could probably improve)- There is tutorial area which teaches you how to blink and interact with object, which is quite good but doesn't take to long if you already know all this stuff.- Moving object around can be a bit flaky and could use some work.

There has been a resurgence of adventure games recently with Telltale's series and Life Is Strange. This game harkens back more to those adventure games of the 90s that LucasArts used to make, and the popular Myst series. There is still a strong narrative but it doesn't take as much focus as the more recent adventure offerings which are often small bits of gameplay peppered around long cutscenes and NPC dialogue. Here the emphasis is more on environmental storytelling, with additional exposition being delivered via cassette tapes you'll (perhaps inexplicably) find around the game, and traditional NPC dialogue.The game has some of the best interaction with objects I've seen in a game. Most objects you can find in the game are able to picked up, and the way your virtual hands interact with them feel very natural. This game also has the best virtual inventory system I've seen in a game; you pull a backpack out from behind your back and reach to grab the items you want from it. If you want to stow something into your backpack, whilst holding the item you reach behind your back. The occasional puzzles you encounter in the game use this excellent interaction model to great effect.This is one of the best launch titles for VR, highly polished with about two hours of content. So the question is is it worth it? Currently it is one of the highest priced games on Steam for VR. Personally I felt the price was worth it, but that opinion is coloured by virtue of this being a VR game. If this was not a VR game, I feel like this game would be better priced at about $20 for the episode. I don't think you can disregard the VR because right now the audience for VR is very small and the developers likely need to charge a higher price to compensate for smaller sales. If you're looking for a VR adventure game in the vein of Myst or The Dig, then I recommend this. If you're on the fence, it might be worth waiting to see how future episodes are reviewed or for price drops."

This episode begins a bit slowly, with the atmosphere seeming a bit understated. Regardless of if that is intentional, it definitely has a sort of way about it that seems very unique and fresh.

I was especially impressed with the inventory system which has you reach over your shoulder to grab your virtual back pack.You can then position it somewhere convenient to acces your various items. Once your finished simply grab the bag and put it back over your shoulder. Very simple mechanic but i thought it was a cool way to manage inventory without clunky menus.I look forward to more form this team and this story arc but im sure a more realistic pricing structure will have to be reached.

It isn't a demo, or a quick experiment. It's not something somebody threw together for a college project. It's a short (< 2 hours) adventure game with easy puzzles, but the art assets and voice acting are what you expect from a full retail game. The world isn't huge; there are 4 locations in the game, but they are all properly atmospheric and look great. This is a glimse at what a full-blown AAA VR game would be like, even if this is only part of one.The controls all just work. Tracking of the two Vive controllers is fine, the haptic feedback works when it needs to, but wasn't anything special. The ""blink"" method of locomotion is passable. I wish the rotation of the destination weren't so finicky. Holding the flashlight and map at the same time, using the flashlight to illuminate the world and the map is great. Item management works well, though it's strange that many objects just can't be taken (only special items can be stored).If these puzzles appeared in a regular 2D adventure game, they would be insufficient. The thing about VR, though, is that if you trade that off with immersion, it's ok. I feel that the stuff that's here, while basic, works well enough because you're *inside the damn game*. But don't come in expecting Grim Fandango.The game is about 110 minutes +/- some time depending on how many bugs you hit. And it's 30 bucks, and it seems like the other chapters will be also. All in will be over $100. If that bugs you, fair enough. But I have two people in the house who will both play it, so to me it's worth the money. My wife and I spend that much on a regular restaurant meal, and you just blew $800 on a Vive. To me, I'd rather do this than play 10 half-baked games.About the bugs: yes, the developer has work to do. Some items will persist in the game world (for me it was a miniaturized set of ammunition for the flare gun), floating there for no reason as you move through the game. They can get stuck onto your hand, and only a reset got rid of them. I also had several instances where the game was bogged down on my GTX 970/i7@3400 GHz machine, though minimizing the game window on my monitor helped. The game also froze after solving the ""main"" puzzle near the end, which made me have to redo it after restarting. More checkpoints would be nice.The Gallery is at times spooky, but I'd never say it's scary. There are no jump scares or anything like that, nobody gets in your face. There are a few sections of automatic locomotion that may make some people motion-sick, so beware of those. It's just a few elevators, but it's a substantial amount of game time near the end. Also, if you run into the frame rate issues I had, you might puke; I don't recommend this if you don't meet the Vive's minimum spec."

I like the backpack inventory and the puzzles in general. The world is very beautiful and feels very spielbergian but it's very short. It also seems like they're almost scared to show the one character you really interact with. He's always in the distance and you never get a clear look at him. One of the biggest things I wanted from VR was characters I could get attached to and grow to care about. I thought this game would be that, but it turns out it's another pretty lonely single player experience. I hope the second chapter has real characters that you can interact with.

It's probably the best ""story-driven"" game that's available on the HTC Vive right now.Here are a couple things that disappointed me:- Lack of subtitles. I'm not a native English speaker and I had some trouble understanding some of the dialogue.- The game adjusting your height if you move around on sloped terrain. It's really disorientating. I understand why it's like that but it breaks the feeling of presence.- It's a little expensive for the length, about 2 hours. That said I understand that for a production value of this caliber, and with VR having such a small market base right now, that's a necessary compromise. It was a bit disappointing since the game ends in the middle of a really amazing moment. I also see the ""expensiveness"" of this as a way to support the funding of the future episodes, so I'm okay with this.Overall I would absolutely recommend this game unless you were really short on money, but if you bought a VR headset anyway you probably aren't... so go for it!"

I am not trying to do Cloudhead games a disservice by comparing them to Valve but their games attention to detail in the environments, the physics of the world and the story completely remind me why i once loved Valve and i think i found my favorite new developer in Cloudhead games. I just started playing The Gallery earlier today and i played for 2 hours straight because they brought their world in this game to life in an amazing way and it sucked me in without any hesitation. I keep reading about people complaining about the price of the game but 30 dollars is a fair price for the best VR game out there right now on the Vive or any other headset bar none.

The mood set by each ""scene"" is incredible, where I was properly on edge in certain parts. I had tingles in a lot of it, and it is the only/first game for the Vive that made me jump... Stupid glowstick falling into water behind me...The story is very well put together, the characters are really well acted/fleshed out considering the minimal contact you have with them. I can't really explain how effective it is.Considering the graphics, the performance of the game is great. I've had so many problems with other Unity games, but this one ran nicely on a R9 290, i5 6600k. Maybe 5 dropped frames the entire time. I did run the game on low, mind, but it still looked great :)My only critical review point would be about the backpack. I found myself struggling to juggle 2 items then get the backpack out etc. I don't know how I would improve it though, it was just too real :PI haven't finished the game yet, but I'm already happy with the purchase. The amount of quality content is 10x to 100x that of a lot of £15 games for the Vive, and I feel bad that the devs are getting negative reviews about the price. My argument goes: at least 5 games in the top 20 Vive games are a single scene, with low quality content but good replayability. Now those are great games and they absolutely have a place, but charging £10-£15 for them just seems wrong when put up against disproportionately  high quality content like this.Anyway, I hope the next episodes are quick for the devs to produce as they have the format, interactions, optimisations all down now.

The player interacts with everything , even her inventory, in a very natural way, from picking up and manipulating objects to opening and closing containers to loading cassettes into aWalkmanTalkmanto throwing and catching items to shaking glowsticks to manually loading a flaregun. Curiosity is encouraged and rewarded, and the player will make use of the full range of her play space, vertical as well as horizontal.The story is engaging, and the graphical and auditory effects are beautiful and immersive.The only thing that makes me hesitate to recommend this title is the conjunction of its length and price. At the time of this writing, it is priced at 28€, and it takes 60-90 minutes to play from beginning to end - potentially a bit longer if you take more time to complete the puzzles and dexterity challenges, or if you explore and examine everything exhaustively. If it were either significantly longer or substantially less expensive (both of which I understand that subsequent episodes will be), I would be harping on and on about it to all my friends, relatives, and casual acquaintances, and relentlessly nagging them to buy and play it.As it is, The Gallery: Call of the Starseed is a fantastic experience, and I heartily recommend it to those who feel it's an adequate value."

I really wasn't disappointed.If this were a normal, 2D FPS-type exploration adventure, you'd whizz through it in about 45 mins. Because you're immersed, however, you take so much more time to observe and enjoy your surroundings. The world is lovingly made and there are lots of details you'd skip without the abillity to pick things up and look at them from all angles.At one point, I had the entirely open choice of using my flashlight, a lantern or a candle. I decided to pick up the candle because I enjoyed moving it around and seeing how it realistically affected shadows. This feature isn't groundbreaking in terms of what game engines can do - but when you're *in*it, it's delightful. Shortly afterward, in my other hand, I picked up a note. As I tried to read it, the ambient light was a little muted, so I moved my candle closer. I had just started to read it when the page blackened and set on fire.The few puzzles you solve are satisfying, and the final big puzzle experience is mesmerising, and done so well. Nothing particularly mentally taxing, but because you're moving things around with your hands it just *feels* more awesome.Other, random highlights:- Moving things that emit sound closer to your ear to hear them better (hint: try the seashells)- Trying to juggle with beer bottles in the tutorial- The beach.- Being able to rotate your playspace to fit each little nook and cranny you want to explore. It meant I could figure the best fit and not have to teleport to enjoy all the details a particular room/spot was hiding.If this were a 2D game, you'd be upset to pay over £20 for it. Because it's VR, it's totally worth it. I felt like I was the silent protagonist of a feature length episode of a new JJ Abrams/Damon Lindelof collaboration. I'm really looking forward to Episode 2, and am *really* pleased this will now be bundled with the Vive as I think it's a fantastic intro to what storytelling in a VR experience can be."

Plus I ran into some bugs, for example entering the sewer system through the gate (after the beach) caused the vision to go black and I was unable to go/turn back, it just stayed like that , so I had to restart the game.That aside, the game did finally run pretty smooth on the lowest settings with a low-ish resolution (changeable in setting), and sweet jesus the experience is awesome. Well designed and differenciated levels, lots of cool game mechanics.  The game is indeed short (4 chapters that you can each basically rush through in a few minutes), but you can spend much more time exploring the world.Also, the ending tight as ♥♥♥♥ and definitely justifies buying the game."

This game is on the shorter side but I believe you get your money worth compared to other games in the VR landscape right now.  The Gallery is detailed and you can tell a lot of work and love went into it's creation.  The environmental puzzles are fun.  I would say they are hard but not unreasonable.Be aware that this game has the player's head moving around quite a bit unsynchronized with your physical head.  Your tracking system isn't bugged out, realize the game is trying to keep your head the same distance from the terran you are moving on.  I was able to get used to this once I realized what the game was trying to do.After finishing the game I took the headset off and said ""Whoa.  That was something different and awesome."""

I beat the game in almost exactly an hour. The puzzles weren't difficult at all, and there was not 'exploration' due to being very linear. Graphics were fine, not quite at 'The Lab' level but better than some other VR experiences. For me it wasn't worth the ~$25 I paid for it, but it is a great start to something that will hopefully end up being interesting (the game stops on a cliff-hanger, just as it is getting good). That being said, this will be the first (and hopefully last) game I've ever refunded on Steam (I seriously cannont justify $25 for 1 hour of gameplay, since my wife isn't going to be interested in doing a playthrough of this game). If they add episode 2 to this as a paid, or cheap, DLC I'll gladly re-purchase it (perminately) to continue on with the story, but for now it goes back on my wishlist for me to watch as things *hopefully* improve."

Felt like I was inside a Pirates of the Caribean movie almost (no pirates though sorry). I did pick during the Steam sale otherwise I might have not dropped the $30 Ill admit.

The environment and detail and space the game gives you is really what made it for me. At times I was scared and at other times I was dancing. It's obvious they were inspired by so many things, from Goonies to 2001, and they found a way to synthesize it all.

Graphics are stunning, was surprised to see this was a Unity game. Music score is great and fits the scenes perfectly. The puzzles were easy enough that as a non-puzzle person, I wasn't frustrated. My major gripe with this game (besides the short length) was the blink teleportation- I would really prefer directional locomotion as teleportation breaks immersion, and when the environments look this high quality and detailed, you really want to stay immersed. I actually shelved the game for a few months after starting it because I disliked the teleport so much. Lack of facial animation on the characters was a bit disappointing and immersion-breaking as well. The backpack inventory system was really innovative. Voice acting was great. Overall, one of the best, most highly-polished games out at this time., with really nice detail in the environments. I am on the fence about purchasing Emberstone if there is no directional locomotion (and hopefully it is much longer, with more puzzles)."

The movement is very smooth, the interaction and inventory system glorious, and the varied use of depth-of-field was actually done extremely well; that being something that, at least conceptually, I would have thought would clash with VR.There is full voice acting and the actors did a fine job. None of the acting came off as cheesy or amature. The graphics are very good as well and the story thus far is certainly intriguing. I wouldn't say the puzzles were all that difficult. The fuze puzzle to me  was the ""hardest"" and did take me a couple minutes which I rather enjoyed, but it was mostly just a linear walk-through after the first checkpoint.Even so, it is a very enjoyable and atmospheric world that I highly recommend to anyone with a VR headset."

This was the first adventure/puzzle game I downloaded for my Vive setup. Once you get used to the controls, they feel extremely natural. The only thing that left me a bit disoriented were areas with major slope changes in the ground. This results in the camera vertical position jumping to the correct height to prevent you from clipping into surfaces; as disorienting as it was, it doesn't happen frequently at all, and I personally don't know of a better solution to that game design challenge.My favorite innovation was the inventory system. Once you get used to using the backpack, it feels very natural and fun!"

It's more of an experience.There is very little to do beside walking (=teleporting), and the puzzles are really uneven. The first one is actually pretty hard to figure out as you have no idea what to look for.I enjoyed the final one with the capacitors but that was about it.The final sequence (that everyone is raving about) does have a nice 'Encounters of the Third Kind' feeling about it, but the dialog is pretty meaningless and doesn't fit the preceding events. It's plain inexplicable. Also, the sequence itself is more of a visual effort than a story or event. It doesn't make much sense.The game mechanics are generally okay, although there are some glitches (I had to solve the final puzzle with e flare shell stuck to my left hand). Voice acting is great (especially the sister on the tapes) and sounds are also spot on.If you're considering buying it, do so for the ambience and visuals, not a great adventure game.

Games like this one get a lot of mileage on our Vive, since I play, wife plays, kids play - so we get a lot of bang for the buck on puzzle adventure like this.Some of the pros are:- Very immersive- Wonderful Graphics (as good as currently able in VR headsets at the moment)- Not to be a spoiler, but it's hard to believe where you are at the end of the game ... considering you start on a beach.- Impressive feelings of descending at various parts.- Decent Locomotion.

Definitely worth your money.I do still think it's price point is high for the hours spent playing but Graphically and story wise it's AMAZING! where you end up is SO different than where you start. And it sets up the next episode so well. I CAN NOT WAIT to play the next one.Yes I still have some issues with the way you ""blink"" as well, but none of these issues are dealbreakers. People need to stop saying there are no VR games to play because I'm sure they haven't tried this.  If you own a VIVE this is a NO BRAINER. I'm going to play it again for the acheievements. It's that good!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For the most part I think this is a great VR experience. It's one of the few I've played that really feel like a full fledged game not just a tech demo. I also like that, unlike most other VR games, you do get options to turn up the graphics performance.2 Things I don't like1: controls. They just don't work for me AT ALL.Either you look where you're teleporting or point to your teleport location (options for both in settings). Unfortunatly neither is a very good solution. To make matters worse they want you to rotate the touchpad to the direction you want to move to While having the pad pressed down.. When you release it teleports you to the location and direction you chose.  Not sure if they have a different Vive than I do but that just DOESN'T WORK.  I really want to keep exploring this world but I spend 70% of the time trying to face the right direction.Devs if you're reading this: Please allow for a toggling option. So you press the pad down and release once to get into ""blink mode"" then you can move your head or pointer to get to where you want to go. You can also slide your thumb in the direction you want to stand. Then press the touch pad down and release again to blink.I know it sounds cumbersome but I'm sure it would become second nature in a matter of minutes and you'd be fine. Also thats a better solution than what we have now. You can't keep the pad pressed down while also moving in the direction you want to go. I'm surprised this game has been out this long with no up date to that.2. The price. LIke I said at the top of this review the game is great. Looks great; shows alot of promise.  And I totally get that this is a new meduim so Devs taking real risks and making real games ( instead of the basic experience we're seeing in VR today) should be rewarded.  But that same arguement works the other way.  This is new: if you want it to grow the installbase you shouldn't make episode 1 cost $30. Even if its a full experience, the title suggests you'll be buying more than just 2 episodes. Thats too expensive for something thats  still far from mainstream. Those prices will keep people from jumping in.I think they're afraid there's not enough of an install base yet so early adopters are supplementing the price to keep them working on it maybe?It's not a deal breaker though because I've seen far less quality VR games demand more money. I just wish they made it just a bit cheaper since we're talking episodes.But I totally dig it. People should definitely sheck it out."

,Recommended,270130,29215399,Posted: 12 January,all,melon202,"The Gallery Call of the Starseed (Episode One) Ended up on my VR Playlist when I was looking for narrative story games in VR. This is what I found so I added it. So when you drop the $20 dollars to play the VR game on steam your expecting quality, as $20 is quite expensive for a VR game. And Gladly when you boot the game up that is what you get. The graphics are very good for a VR game and the graphics settings are adjustable in game. The game is loaded with cool depth of feild effects, bloom, and other various visual gags. and it also runs very smoothly.The game starts off with a tutorial, and it lasts for about 5 to 10 min and teaches you the basics of how to move around the enviroment and pick up objects. I Liked the tutorial and it had a good voice over. then it moves on to the area selection which is done by playing tapes in a tape player (The models of which have stunning detail I might add) I like the idea of playing tapes more then hitting a button. Its an unessesary detail for the game devs to include, but they did it anyways. It was creative.The game then goes on to take a semi long but pretty average loading screen. After its done loading it drops you on a drop dead gorgeous rocky beach with lots of little things to pick up and play with. Now when your wlaking on the beach there will actually be an area where there are two paths to explore one to a sewer and one farther into the beach, now the game doesnt tell you the correct path to it just allows you to explore for yourself. It does not hold your hand. eventually you go down the beach farther and it actually has a mini tutorial kind of thing to show you how to use your back pack and tools then you go up a stair case to find a workshop in the rocks with many interesting areas to explore and things to look at and throw around. However the main quest items to actually start telling the story are on the table now like I mentioned before there are actually more tapes and you have a tape player so the story is told through the tapes. You hear the character's voises but you do not actually get to see the characters until later and you only get to see two of them at that. I really enjoyed this hyping up of the characters it invests me more in the story for some reason.Anyways, you read a paper get a flare gun then it is on to the first large puzzle. the puzzle is opening the gate to the sewer, and to do the puzzle you have to shoot three bells with the flare gun. Now I didn't listen to any of the extra tapes the professor recorded so the solution to the puzzle may have been in those. But if it wasnt for youtube playthroughs, I would have had no idea to shoot the bells.  but eventually you get it then move on to the sewer.Now I'm going to cut the review short here, because I don't want to spoil the rest of the game and I will be here all day if I go over the whole thing. But in the end I got around 3 hours with the first episode. Now I was hoping for more but I guess we will have to wait for the next episode right? I just hope I don't have to buy it because The game is already pretty expensive for a 3 hour game. Anyways in short the VR implementation was excellent, the puzzles were well thought out and difficult but not too difficult, and the story has me hooked and kind of ends on a cliff hanger. Can't wait to play more! and I give it a 9.2/10 (Played on HTC Vive)"

I am eagerly awaiting Episode 2, even though I suspect it too will have a high price. You do have to consider the fact that this is an experimental field, both for developers and consumers, which is why The headsets are so expensive, as well as the games. There is not enough information on either end to predict the direction virtual reality will take. Just my two cents, but I feel the 30 dollar price tag is well justified!11/10 will play again, waiting on the next episode!Also: There are some tracking glitches and the beach (firepit) area does have a very glitchy stutter making you motion sick, but looking straight up kind of fixes it when it gets bad.so -1 point for thatOverall 10/10"

The story is mysterious and makes we want to play the next episode. Playing leisurely, I finished the whole episode in 80 minutes. This seems short to me, even for an episodic game. This is also the second most expensive of the 15 VR games I've bought. On the other hand, this is the closest I've seen to a AAA game for the Vive (or at least the introductory chapter of one). As a story-based game, there isn't much (any) replayability, although VR in general is starving for more story and less arcade.Unfortunately, the VR market is still small which is likely the cause for the price if the devs hope to recoup the costs of their top-quality content. If the next episode comes at the same price, I hope they manage to significantly increase content quantity to match their already impressive quality.Performance is impressive, especially looking as good as it does. I have a GTX970 an an i54690K@4Ghz, and didn't have any performance issues after the beach, and the minor framerate dips on the beach weren't bad enough to cause the nausea that major stuttering does."

Trying to rotate the teleport space was a little akward with the touch pad, but that's maybe a hardware/firmware issue.   Also aiming with your head is awkward/kinda uncomfortable.  I really like how Valve had it setup, where you aim with the controller, and press the touch pad to instantly teleport.  You have a delay in this game, as you ""walk"" to the teleport area or something.- Some of the env. art felt a bit in-consistent.   The last env. felt pretty rough.  Geo wasn't too bad, but the textures looked almost placeholder/temp.  Lower res/too large of UV scale/noitceable seams/ect.- In multiple cases, when I leaned my body left/right, the whole world seemed to move up and down or something. Which started to get me a little motion sick/unstable.  It wouldn't always move, and in some cases only 1-2"".  But the worst was when it moved 6"" to 1ft, and I really started to feel un-easy.  Not sure if a bug or what.- When I loaded into an area once, maybe since I teleported into a doorway before the load, the loading icon/menu was broken, and I saw 3 large grey planes infront of me.- In multiple cases, the Flare Gun ammo got stuck floating in the air attached to my gun.  Or I couldn't drop the ammo/interact anymore.  So I had to load it into the gun to get rid of it, or shoot my flare gun till empty, then reload.- The backpack, while cool, wouldn't get put away many times, when I thought it did.  So I started to walk away, and it was floating there yet.   Or I could try to drop items into it over my shoulder, and it would miss and fall to the ground.  Unless I wasn't doing something right.- The game is very short.  Depending how fast you solve the puzzles.  But, even still maybe only 2-3 hours long.- The env was very linear/not really much to explore or checkout.   I probably wouldn't play through a second time. Unless to show friends/ect."

Since most of the ground is sloped, shifting your weight or leaning/etc causes the world to raise/lower. Also with the winding map, you're constantly having to turn around and reorient yourself after teleporting. There are a lot of objects close to your player, which isn't comfortable on a Vive. The 'sweet spot' for view distance on a Vive/Rift is at least a few feet from your character. I got this weird sensation after taking it off when physical objects that were close to me felt too close, since the Vive renders near objects as a few feet away. I also found myself impaled by objects several times while teleporting from room to room. That's a little awkward when you're already starting to feel sick.Overall, a high quality game but they need to apply some VR learnings to their level design. I'll try to work through the rest of this game in small chunks. Hopefully episode two has a little more flat ground.."

While there's a couple of puzzles and a little maze, it's mostly just exploring the environment, interacting with objects (which can be fun in itself) and discovering the story. The fact that, in VR, you are actually there, really makes this an experience rather than just a nice little story. Though limited, I also thought the voice acting was well done.That being said, I wish you could give a neutral rating on Steam, because at 2 hours, including a fair amount of time fooling around with breaking bottles and setting off fireworks, I think the price tag, currently at $30, is steep. I hope future episodes are either cheaper or include more content, otherwise I may not continue this adventure. And I do want to continue it. I don't know where you go at the end, but it's bound to be a cool trip.As a side note, I did occasionally have issues with skipping and occasionally a frozen camera for a second or two, but I'm also running an old CPU that caps out when I try to run Job Simulator and Budget Cuts, leaving those games off limits for me.

On the one hand, it was lovingly crafted, with lots of little details and a great interface and UI. The time I spent with it was enjoyable, and it felt more like a tripple A game than most launch VR titles do... but on the other, it's so pathetically, laughably short for an adventure game it is insulting to those who pay good money for it. There isn't a whole lot here that isn't what you'd expect from an adventure game, but there's so LITTLE of it is what makes it a problem.The story barely, BARELY gets started. If this was a book it would have ended halfway through the prologue, it's that short! I don't know what else I can compare it to, but the length is just plain a joke. Is the story good? Who knows? There isn't even a ghost of enough of it here to be able to tell. Should we be excited for the next chapter? Who knows? This one is so short we barely got past the title before it was over.A serious player can beat this in well under an hour. The only reason I have as much playtime as I do on record is because I spent an unusually long time playing around with the environment... and despite the shortness, I managed to find a bug that wasted my time for over an hour by denying me a clue that was floating around that I needed to progress.I hate to harp on how short it is but I just can't get past it. To put it another way, fire up an episodic game from Telltale. Watch the intro. Now play for fifteen minutes. Stop, and that's about how much is here. Now look at what they are charging for this. Can this content possibly justify the price? Another way to put it, there are so few areas for screenshots, the store page actually has one from the tutorial room that has nothing whatsoever to do with the game, other than forced padding! That's some seriously bad form.Is this a cynical cash grab from a company that is exploiting the launch of VR by overcharging for a glorified demo because they know people will buy it due to the lack of titles at launch? I hope not, because I'd heard from the developer and thought they were more passionate about the project than that. More likely, it wasn't anywhere near completed, but the April 5th launch of the Vive was coming close, and they had to lock down what little they had completed and publish.I love the quality on display. I love the interface and gameplay, and I'd love to play a full-length adventure game using the systems developed here. It hurts me to have to bash something so polished, and I really, really want to give it a good review...

The puzzles could have been a bit harder because they are too easy (the fuse one I hate it until I realize there was a hidden clue (not saying which, of course).

What it was is a step in the right direction for what we want exploration games to be in VR, and my critique of the game being too short should speak to the enjoyment I had of the game since it implies I wanted it to continue. Sadly it doesn't, and you are left feeling a bit shocked at how quickly you played through the game considering its asking price. As a game starseed is great, but sadly I don't think I'd recommend it (even at the as of writing this steam summer sale discounted price).If the price included upcomming episodes then I would have recommended it, but right now I'd probably recomend that you wait and see if you can pick it all up later in a bundle after more episodes are released - that way you'll get more value for your money and more content to enjoy at the same time. So for now this is a wait and buy later in my oppinion.PS. It hurts me to give this recommendation because the game itself is really fun and you can see the devs put a lot of love into it.Edit: With the change of the game being included in the purchase of the vive I am changing my recommendation.

The entire design process is new, the interactions are new. Most games or VR products out so far offer 10 to 15 minutes of ""gameplay"" (i.e., just a VR movie) for 10 or 15 bucks.

Despite having quite a few visual wows and a well realised inventory system I couldn't recommend it as I just didn't find it fulfilling.The first puzzle in particular is an unintuitive mess.I spent about half an hour trying to work out a morse code puzzle that didn't exist. The sewer puzzle isn't really a puzzleYou can only go the wrong way by going to the well which lead me to think i would have to put items in the well to get stuff out of the sewer.Finally in the third and fourth sections the puzzles got more interesting. But after that it was time to sit back and enjoy the ride.In general the whole thing felt like the episode once had a lot more content which was cut but the hints of more interesting things were left in. There was never once a point where I got to use knowledge i had learned earlier. There was never a sense of mastery. So what was left was a game that felt like a theme park ride where you get shuffled from one scene to another.Unfortunately the story doesn't quite make up for the lackluster gameplay. [spoilter] The monolog near the end is painfully long whilst you literally do nothing for 10 minutes with very little happening on screen for most of it[/spoiler].In general its the gameplay that really needs a step up here. VR adds a 3D spectacle but this game could have been made without it and without it the game would be utterly forgettable.The controls are well realised and the rotating teleportation works well.  My hope for the developers going forward is now that they have the basics down they really need to double down the gameplay and puzzles for the next episodes.

Period.Lots of effort put into making most objects interactiveVery novel backpack inventory management systemCons:Very short (around 2 - 2.5 hours)A bit pricey for the durationAs others have pointed out, the solutions to some puzzles are not exactly clear. There are hints scattered around, but the world is very detailed so they're easy to miss. It is extremely rare for me to me use any hint or guides but I did need to in order to complete the episode.Overall, I highly recommend this title for any Vive owner."

Only few bugs (like one important object went missing and had to restart the level) Biggest complaint I have is that the game was too short. I liked the story and puzzles were good. Really waiting for Episode 2!

,Recommended,270130,22481614,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,Mega Maniac,"The game is really well put together and is one of the most compelling experiences on the Vive so far.But I simply cannot recommend the game based on the amount of content in the game. It took me a fair amount of time to solve the couple of (actually very simple) puzzles that are there, the time taken mostly by not noticing visual clues which lead to the solution of the puzzle. But even with this relatively slow problem solving the whole game lasted 90mins. Its like a single level of a game.I fully understand the tiny market the developers are dealing with here and they would like to pay their own wages and invest in the future of the platform, but I have come away from this game feeling very impressed with the content that is there but unhappy with the amount of it.I feel like even within the small level that you play through the developers could have stretched out the content, maybe making it a little more difficult or simply putting more puzzles in each stage of the level.I think ultimately it comes down to this: Are you prepared to invest $30/£23 in not just your own experience but in the future of the platform and the developers, because you have to want both as the experience itself just isn't worth the asking price in terms of what we are used to as far as games go.I wouldn't have chosen a 'yes' or 'no' for the recommend option if I didn't have to as I think it hinges on the above question. Personally I think bringing the price down to £17-18 would make it easier to accept and help the game gain wider adoption ultimately resulting in not much loss of revenue, if any at all. Having said this I expect the developers have done more research into the market than my anecdotal guessing.Edit: Since writing this review the price has dropped down to £14.99. this is about what I would consider 'right' for this game, it remains one of the most polished experiences yet."

Its around 2 hours long, but after almost a year of games, this is one of the better ones around and worth buying. When Episode 2 comes out, I will be buying that as this is very well made!"

When I first purchased this game I felt it was a little overpriced at $30, and more importantly I was having a lot of stuttering issues, however those issues seem to be gone, either patched or fixed from my end I don't know.This game is by far the closest to fulfilling my VR dreams. While other great games offer fun short experiences that you can repeat but get boring. The Gallery offers a true immersive story driven experience. They game features some of the best locomotion of any VR game to date (take note Loading Human!), and some of the best environments VR has to offer. Some cool puzzles and wonderful audio design.And the game is now dropped to $20! A price that is fairer for the 2-3 hour experience the games offers.I wish there was more character interaction. Would love the ability to have conversations with other characters and explore the story more that way. Very interested to see what else in done with the gameplay in episode 2 with what happens at the end of episode 1.If you are still looking for the true future of VR, Call of the Starseed is what you need to buy! After finishing I am desperately looking for other games that comes close to this experience. VR is perfect for adventure games, and Call of the Starseed proves it!"

Arcade style VR games are a ton of fun, but this story-centric puzzle game just completely blew me away. It is so beautiful, immersive, and detailed -- there were several moments in the game where I genuinely found myself just standing slack-jawed in total awe. Starting about 15 minutes in, I pretty much just completely forgot I was playing a game until the end of the episode.Waxing a little less poetic-- the story was engaging, the puzzles were tricky but not SO tricky that you'll find yourself getting frustrated, and though the atmosphere and characters were often somewhat spooky/ creepy, it was never so scary that I felt I needed to take a break. It was exciting to find a story-based mystery VR game outside of the horror genre. The price is steep for around two hours of gameplay, and I don't think the game has much replay value . . . but what a game."
