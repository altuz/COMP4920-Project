76561198281484746,Not Recommended,270170,29909158,Posted: 13 February,all,FreakeyP,"Text based game with very stereotypical situations.Did not seem to be much of an effort put in to this game.Instead of helping people, it makes you want to turn the game off.Depression isn't just about one thing. Like an onion there are many layers to depression.The game seemed to deal vary basic ideas of depression.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbpN59h4qfg"

If I could package siphilis in a box and sell it this is the worst product ever.I would rather watch the room or play superman for n64 before I ever load this again.

Literally, if you just don't pick what are the obviously wrong choices, you win. The lesson I got from this is, ""Hey, depressed people, all you need to do is start being social and you win! No more depression!"" Kinda insulting. GOD. It's so bad. IT'S SO BAD. Is this even game? Ugh, it's so bad it's funny. Also, can't wait to get some for leaving a bad review."

I can’t really call it a game as I did nothing but click next or select the only option not crossed out. Which made it feel as though I was just reading a novel/ebook, and not a well written one at that."

It filled me with despair at the time, but then again, so did finding out that Santa wasn't real. At least the Devs didn't expect to be paid for it.By the way, what on God's flying green f*** is this doing in the games section? It's a series of glorified blog posts! If 'you' was replaced with 'I,' then it'd be worth quite a few Victim Bux."

The option to see a therapist and take anti-depressants and talk to people was a cathartic experience that makes me believe that it can get better for me. There's a way out of this if I talk to people, and I just arranged for myself to get therapy for this. Thank you for making this, I definitely recommend if you want to get an insight into what living with depression is like."

Although it is hard sometimes, you want to help the character and show, that you can do it."
76561198032371229,Recommended,270170,30052897,Posted: 20 February,all,Ghost,"A chilling, thought provoking, and accurate representation of depression. This game is not enjoyable, however, that is not the purpose that it is supposed to serve. This is a narrative game with the purpose of making you think, and it succeeds in this regard. Personally, I believe that this is the most accurate representation of depression that I have found in media, and I am thankful for it. Ultimately, this is less of a game and more of an art piece."

I felt myself at one point feelign completely powerless to change where the game is going and improve my characters outlook. For the people giving negative reviews because of that, your really missing the point. Its supposed to make you feel lke theres no hope of improving your situation.I've never seen such a huge number of people who negatively reviewed the game because they missed the point. Seriously trhe guy complaining that theres no difficulty progression I'm surprised you know how to read.This game is amazing. It wont be fun but yo uwill be moved by it. If your not moved by it then go play it again because you clearly missed the point."

I only ever attended one therapy session IRL for example, but I'll come back to it.. at some point, and see where that path leads."
,Recommended,270170,29925646,Posted: 14 February,all,enorca,"This game is fantastic! I really enjoyed it. It's a simple text based adventure game where you play as a depressed person. At the begining of the game this person does not realise that he has depresion. The game ofers variuos ways to help yourself in life. While playing the first time I tried to choose the options that would fit my own tactics in similar situations the best. And got the brightest ending. Then I wondered that maybe that's because I don't have depression and then tried to play again deliberatly choosing the worst possible options.... and got the worst ending :SThis game is short, easy to play, and teaches a lot about yourself and other. Would recommend to anybody looking how to spend and not to waste a spare hour.PS music is fantastic!"
,Recommended,270170,30124113,Posted: 23 February,all,A trash can somewhere,"This game is absolutly amazing, its slightly emotional and I relate to some of the stuff in it. Lack of sleep, emotionally unstable and really stressed out. Its not entirely relatible but still, its great.I love games lke these and because it's mostly relatable I can find the best options that I can to help this fictional characcter to see if it can help me in my later life."
,Recommended,270170,30153691,Posted: 24 February,all,OGB Idle-Empire.com,It's good but not everyone gets so lucky with depression and this example seemed specific and somewhat stereotypic as if the only ways to get better with depression is with therapy and having a support network. It would be better if there was more than one story to come at depression from more than one angle and to illustrate how deep and varied the illness is

,Recommended,270170,29533547,Posted: 27 January,all,xdmeme,"Depression Quest is an interactive fiction game where you play as someone living with depression. You are given a series of everyday life events and have to attempt to manage your illness, relationships, job, and possible treatment. This game aims to show other sufferers of depression that they are not alone in their feelings, and to illustrate to people who may not understand the illness the depths of what it can do to people. Since the goal is to spread awareness, there is no minimum amount you need to pay to play the game. However, if you do choose to pay the developers for their efforts, a portion of the proceeds will be donated to National Suicide Prevention Hotline. I used to cut my wrists until I saw this amazing game, Depression Quest taught me that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporarily problem, and allowed me to open my eyes and get counseling for my cutting and my depression. It has allowed me to make new friends and start conversations with strangers."

It was one of the most carthadic experiences I had ever had at that stage of my short life. This game is truly excellent. Something unique and new. I understand it's not fun. Most of it is just reading. But the simplicity of the game is truly benneficial. If you have or are currently suffering from depression then you should play this game.

I know that many people experience depression in different ways so this game won't always be relateable. But it got it right for me.
76561198025066754,Recommended,270170,30083826,Posted: 21 February,all,cres3.14,"I picked up this game after watching a longform discussion of it by Noah Caldwell-Gervais, in which he shared that Depression Quest accurately reflected his own experiences with depression. I have never been depressed, but among the people that I love are people who are battling with depression. This experience has helped me better understand and empathise with the struggle they go through, and that insight is invaluable. Depression Quest isn't ""fun,"" and you shouldn't expect it to be. However, Depression Quest connected deeply with me on an emotional level, and was well worth my time. I hope the same will be true for you."
