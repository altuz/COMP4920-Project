The puzzles were challenging but not impossible.  The only negative is that this game was trasnlated to english (from polish I think) and the translations are a bit off, you definitely get the jist of what they're saying but it often comes off as a little goofy which detracts a bit from the dark atmosphere.All in all, a good point and click puzzler with unique artwork/graphics."

Most of this is me starting over again and again while I was recording my walkthrough videos.  With that in mind, I want to share my thoughts about this game with you.First: Are you are a fast action, first person shooter, explode first ask questions later kind of person?If you said yes and get bored reading a review half way through then this isn't the game for you.This is a point and click adventure puzzle game.  There is no combat mechanic in it.  The game makes you think.  So if you enjoy puzzles and creative and/or critical thinking then this may be something you like.Second: Are you used to games holding your hand?  Do you skip the dialog knowing the answer is in the journal or marked on the map for you?If you said yes then this may not be the game for you either.This game has a story and a plot.  This game has a clear direction your character is going in.  The difference is that it doesn't tell you what that is.  The character has no clue what is going on and so why should the game tell you?Third: Are you a snob for perfect grammar and spelling?  Do you judge a game by its sound effects? music? graphics?If you said yes then this may not be the game for you either.This game was created by a polish company.  Words, Spelling, and Grammar don't always translate well the first time.  The development team is working on fixing that of course, but people like to take their shots when they can.  It's a translation issue not an intelligence issue.  Also the game isn't full of CGI or motion capture cut scenes.  They use very well done stills and limited animation paired with an excellent narrator and music to get the mood across.There will always be someone who has something bad to say about a game.  Everyone is entitled to their opinions.  But look carefully at what they are saying before you judge the game by their words.  This game is thought out, well designed, and the challenges require observation, problem solving, and some skill.  Some of the puzzles are static puzzles, others are random,  but no puzzle is repeated in the game.tl:dr ?If this is where you skipped to don't buy the game.  It isn't a game for you.If you are here for a summary? ok then.Classic Point and Click Adventure Puzzle.  A throwback to the 90sGood graphics and music set the mood and theme for the game.Controls? they are exact, no room for errorReplay ability? low unless you are a completionist and want those achievements!"

The story so far is interesting enough to make me want to continue playing.  The gameplay is very similar to your typical BigFishGames hidden object game but even with that I would say you should give it a try.  If you're into the high action shoot-em-up games of today then you may want to pass on this.

It has a really great dark heavy atmosphere, with some nice eerie cutscenes (I just love the narrator's voice). There is a good variety of puzzles (some very hard to solve, some easier) which is great. I wish there was more games like this one having both a compelling story and strong puzzles."
,Not Recommended,270190,21992787,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,niX,"Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game. Just not good enough to recommend.The gameplay is point and click puzzling solving which is actually pretty solid. The main problem is that the puzzles range in difficulty from easy to just plain crazily convuluted and overally complex. This makes the game feel tedious and frustrating. The challenge is all over the map and it breaks the game in my mind.The game is relatively short, but I feel the price tag is justified for the amount of time you'll probably spend as you try to trudge through the puzzles. The game has a lot of gore, but they went a bit overboard with it, and it doesn't feel scary at all because of it. I do, however, feel that the art syle works for what they were trying to achieve and is one of the main highlights. The story is fragmented and poorly delivered, with no closure at the end.It has no replayability. There is literally nothing different if you play the game a second time, unless you want to try and replay it for some achievements. Hardly seems worth it to randomly click the screen 5,000 times for a single lousy achievement. The ""play the game for three hours"" achievement seems bugged, so this screws those who likes to try and get a 100% rating in games.Lastly, I had minor issues with the game in terms of funcationality. There's no options menu to fix the screen resolution, sound, etc. You're forced to play in full screen. This would be fine if my game didn't crash when I tried to alt tab out if it was necessary. This wasn't always the case, and luckily the game's auto saving is good, otherwise it would be a complete trainwreck.Although an honest attempt was made and there are some good points, ""tedious"" is really the best way I can describe this as a whole."

I would say it's only worth picking up if you are very patient, are interested in seeing more of the unique art style, and are willing to accept an abrupt and anticlimactic ending.

You just need to use your sixth sense to guess that you need to click that grey dot, one of hundred on the screen, because it represents hatch while others represent stones.Near the end of the quest you suddenly have to start playing realtime, shooting squares with precision and speed of Counter-Strike Pro and without a single error.

By that, I mean that if you click in multiple places in fast increments, the screen will freak out and literally TELL you not to do that. It even forces you to stop whatever you're doing and not click on anything for 5 seconds until the game finally settles down so you can resume.What sane person would think that any of these things are acceptable in a POINT-N-CLICK adventure game? I've never used guides for any puzzle games that i've played, but for this game it's a necessity if you want to progress in this game.Unless you want to play a game of ""guess what the dev is thinking"", go waste $10 elsewhere."

Many of them were free online flash games, so thats the experience I went into this game with. First things first. Do you like a challange? If you do this may or may not be up ur alley...This game has the tendency to throw a lot of items at you without any explination, hints, or dialogue that might lead you forward. Most items needed are hidden, as in the blend very well in the back ground. other times the damn items are not picked up, even if you have clicked them 2 or 3 times. for example,*SPOILER*the crow bar thing you need is next to the vent of the raised city. I clicked that ♥♥♥♥ing thing 4 times. the 5th time I guess I clicked it in the right spot because I picked it up.*SPOILER END*A game should not be hard, becuase the mechanics are ♥♥♥♥ed up. and as for any direction in the game, there is none. you basically wander about not knowing where to go and what to do next. maybe thats a apart of the ambiance. who knows. it left me wishing there was more story line in the form of notes, or messages. I felt like I was just doing random things that had no real significance. (yeah i know its  point and click, the point is to solve random puzzles) but some good PCs have story to them or reference other storeis or events.Next comes the graphics. The digitially drawn graphics were nice. they added to the creepy factor and the dream like atmosphere. I wish there was a bit more creepy invovled but its fine the way it is.My biggest problem was the grammar. (ignore my bad grammer, i dont care suckas) throughout the game, there were rubish sentences and misspellings, like ""the doors ale closed""  ""ale"" closed dont you mean ""are"" closed? and others with no subject verb agreement and in some cases, the use of wrong words. I know they are polish, but still. If you are going to have an english version, get a translater, not google translate. The narrartor was cool, I really liked his voice.I dont see my self playing this game again. which brings me to a close.TL:DRthe game as messed up mechanics, and you dont always pick up an item after clicking it. the bad grammar was distracting but the narrator and graphics were cool. The lack of intructions and dialogue in the form of notes or messages, made it feel like I was wandering about aimlessly.so I give it a 5/10.

I was sucked in by the trailer, but disappointedly, this game did not meet my expections.Before I get to the negatives, I dp have some positives. The artwork was amazing, the suspense was perfect, and the little narrations that gave away little clues as to what was going to happen next were pretty good. I did enjoy the story line, but it was way too short. Otherwise, this game was well done.And now for the bad news.The puzzles became too frustrating that the only solution I had was looking up a walkthrough. I don't want that. I want a game to be enjoyed by myself, I shouldn't have to look for help to further myself through the game. There were limited hints that could be used. Using a hint to teleport me to an area isn't much of a help. The hint system was a plus for me, but the hints given weren't that big of a deal.Plus, the ending. What happened? All my efforts for nothing? No ""defeating the boss"" or ""killing of the psychotic bad guy""? Nope. Just another kidnap and the game's over.Although this game is a greenlight game, a little more effort would make this game perfect.

The puzzles were hard (some harder than others) but possible if you thought you way through it. But some of the hidden items and things you are meant to do are confusing. And some you need to think literally about. Such as, what makes up a fishing pole and what do you need to use an empty lantern (Oil and a Hook) But a lot of the time some things also don't make sense (Lets murder animals and put them in bottles! :D)There were a couple little problems. Needing to use a guide to progress on occassion wasn't all that good. Like these puzzles Professor Layton would even scratch his head over! There was 1 line of text that wasn't translated. (When you click on the arm things in the torture room thing on your 2nd visit to the room (1st visit is in the tutorial part)) Russian maybe? Idk languages well enough to say for sure. And a the 'play for over 3 hours' achievement glitched out for me I think. (Since I've played twice that yet haven't gotten it.

I needed an item in the game, I knew it 100%. The problem was that I never found the item, until I checked a video online. It was very well hidden, but very important, and without it I could not get further.Backgrounds are also cool, and the narrator just got the right voice.
