Well the controls are terrible, but the game is alright.The puzzles are interesting, but I feel like the hunting for the objects is much harder than the actual varied puzzles (none of which have taken me more than a few minutes), it's hard to build good depth when you only use a puzzle system once. The story is well executed, with forshadowded twists (so it's rewarding to be engaged with the story) with decently good voice acting. The controls are abysmal, even with an options menu for them, the mouse controls are completely bonkers, they *need* a ""normal mouse"" checkbox, and there are no convience features I often see in similar style games (auto save, arrow key navigation, some transitions (via doors) take too long, etc). The graphics are alright, some scenes look very nice, others merely ok, due to compression and the resolution I play at the video transitions look terrible (I also spoted one immersion breaking graphical glitch in the cafeterria).If Myst style point and click games with a sci-fi story are your thing, this is an alright game for that genre, I enjoyed it because I love the genre, but it probably wouldn't pull in someone not specifically looking for the experience. Unfortunetly there is also a problem with the ""price / quality / play time"" ratios; there are probably better options out there for the price. So I recommended it to people who want to scratch that genre itch."

How so? many thing one being the environment -youre on board some sort of ship.  Submarine or spaceship? you soon find out. There is no horror or jump scares not at all its a lovely adventure point and click game 360 degrees vision but not free walking. Its first person though. point your middle of screen cursor and if theres an arrow you click once and ""you"" walk a few steps automaticaaly. I actually prefer this freedom of movement because you dont have to inspect EVERY nook and cranny you pass by. Also it cuts down any motion sickness or dizzyness you may get to nil. well for me anyway. i love this game if you are a adventure ""myst"" gamer like me then you will enjoy this though not near as much as soma."

Always wanted a 3D rendered version and this I think is the closest I'll ever come to it.I play 'fps' games mostly and this is frankly a refreshing and totally different experience. Can have a cup of tea and cake, take my time and feel that I'm actually doing my brain some good.These kind of games died sometime ago but with 'Julia among the stras' and 'Prominence' they seem to be coming back.Ok, it's not everyone's genre but as far as I'm concerned it's well worth the dosh. The key to these type of games is simply don't give up and look everywhere carefully, floor, wall grills, cupboards etc. Ok, got that. good.Thought I'd add that I play this on an i5 4670k 3.4GHz pc with an ATI R9 280X GPU 14.1 drivers, 16mb ram. Obviously no fps problems and althought the 14.1 drivers need updating (they don't play minecraft, that's how flawed they are) it runs Prominence fine."

Basicly, besides all the fun we are having, we ARE spending a lot of time patiently saing ""Of course, pressing forward made me go backwards, just what I intended...""UPDATE: I have no clue if the developers have solved the problem yet, but my problem was due to some truble regarding my integrated and dedicated graphics cards.

,Recommended,270230,19573742,"Posted: 8 December, 2015",all,tealeaf,"A wonderful adventure game, with a genuinely interesting story. Plenty of puzzles to keep you interested, and plenty of exploring and discovery without endless trudging around picking up random objects. From the first 'who and where am I?' moments, you feel that there's a real progression as you learn more.The story also leaves enough unsaid and unexplained that you feel part of a wider 'real' world, rather than endless explanations and tying up of every conceivable loose end. Very good story writing.On the negative side, some of the controls are a bit awkward, including an apparent bug with some graphics cards for which the relevant point to click appears when you're facing in completely the wrong direction. (I fixed this on a Thinkpad T440s by forcing it to use its NVIDIA chip rather than the integrated Intel graphics.)My one complaint is that there are multiple endings, but there's no real signal for you when you 'choose' this. It was only due to browsing the forums that I discovered that a seeming non-choice was actually a point where I could go in two very different directions. I suggest playing through, and if you can't work out how things could have ended differently then feel free to look up spoilers in the forum.Overall, a lovely game and well worth the money."

It pays homage to old school point and clicks, whilst keeping some fresh new ideas and a good mixture of different puzzle types in a rich and enjoyable environment, all round.I played on a new laptop with hybrid graphics, having an Intel HD 5500 on board plus dedicated Nvidia GeForce 940M. Without making any changes, it ran on the Intel, and I had the issues described, including some awful slow-downs on transitions that meant I had to stop and restart each time it happened - which was often. When I forced the game to run only on the Nvidia, none of the problems were apparent and it was noticibly much smoother, immersive and enjoyable, problem-free. Prominence has an engaging storyline, quality voice acting and good plot development.So I think some compatibility issues there, but once overcome - if you can - it's a great game for the money, if a little short for me.Recommended for classic adventure fans."
,Recommended,270230,20307752,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,markzwaan,"Liked this game a lot. It's easy to ruin a point and click adventure game (unfortunately), but this one pretty much nails it. Reminds me of what the best point and click games of the late nineties had to offer (think of the Myst series, 7th Guest, 11th Hour, Journeyman Project series etc.). It has good looking graphics, an interesting story that's slowly revealed, an intuitive interface and well integrated puzzles. None of those - I guess I'll just lock my safe with a sliding puzzle - type of puzzles. And also no puzzles that require some heavy lateral thinking in many, many complex steps (remember the puzzles from Day of the Tentacle or Monkey Island?). Some achievements can be tricky to get, but they are fun to find and there's plenty of hints in the forum. I've encountered no bugs, no glitches and no crashes, so the ones that have contributed to the negative reviews have aparantly been fixed. I'm also very glad they included the momentum slider. When I first started to play the game I felt seasick and had trouble clicking things until I turned the momentum WAY down. The only other negatives I can think of is the fact that the enhanced view mode you receive later on in the game has to be actived with the F2 key, which is all way on top of the keyboard. It would have been nice if it had been bound to either the space bar, the middle mouse button or if you could have turned this mode on and off from the inventory screen. Also the cursor changes to an upwards pointing arrow when you can climb up or down a ladder or something similar. It confused me several times having to click with an upwards pointing arrow in order to move down, but I got used to it in the end. Some of the screens could've done with a bit more animation, especially the one in the cockpit. But these are minor irritations which only serves to indicate that there is very little room for improvement. Bottom line: If you like scifi themed point and click adventure games, get this, you won't be disappointed. And even if you're not a fan of scifi themed games you might still enjoy it because it is well made."

,Not Recommended,270230,28309580,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,alison,"This game was a disappointment for me. I am hardcore into both sci-fi games and adventure games, but this just didn't measure up to stuff like Shardlight or Technobabylon. It falls more into the realm of JULIA or STASIS, so if you liked those games you might like this one.My biggest problem is that there is no motivation. There is no one to talk to. There is nothing to care about. You are just a floating head who listens to radio logs and does busywork. There are no narrative puzzles and no creative solutions. There is no opportunity to combine the wrong stuff for comedic result. It feels more like a hidden object game than an adventure to me, except even hidden object games tend to have some kind of compelling (if cliché) story.The lack of story might be forgivable to fans of this sort of puzzling, if it weren't for the absolutely abysmal control mechanism. I have honestly never played an adventure game with such poor controls. It looks like it's a first-person game, but you can't move around with WASD. In fact, you can't move around at all. You are stuck in one spot and you need to very slowly rotate the camera till you find a magic hotspot that lets you click to move to the next corner of the room. There is no freedom to move anywhere. It feels incredibly restrictive and is very tiresome on your wrist.The best part about this game was the walkthrough. It's well-written and adds a lot to the experience, because the in-game mechanics are so bad. But overall the game just isn't very entertaining."

76561198096426378,Recommended,270230,20884410,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,jordipg,"A well-crafted science fiction adventure.  This game is especially commendable because of its attention to detail and the authors' expert writing.  By the end of the game you will know the map of the Laeril, details about the crewby name, and have a small inventory of tricks to solve the various puzzles with.  The story is plausible and original.I was frustrated by several hidden hotspots -- a regression from otherwise excellent, plot-integrated puzzles.  Once you are aware that you spent 10 minutes trying to figure something out, only to discover that you simply weren't aware you could open some container, you spend the rest of the game wondering if the same will be true about each new puzzle.The interface felt old-fashioned at times.  The ability to look around in three dimensions, but only stand in one spot seemed awkward.  The transitions should probably just be turned off for all they add to the game, although several cutscenes were well-done, if short, including a glorious compilation of sun surface video (which I think were taken from real videos of Sol!).Overall, a strong recommendation, especially for science fiction fans.  Certainly not ground-breaking from an interace or graphics standpoint, but this is made up for by the care taken by the authors in crafting a narrative and world to take part in for a few hours."

After you get through the game, your wondering when the movie is coming out.   You have these people, and this technology, and this history, and its all woven together and introduced in the game.  And it's complete - you have relationships between people and leaders and workers and hopes and dreams, and technology failures, and work arounds, and all of it centers around a certain star, and all of that is revealed one peice at a time as you play.  The art in the game is excellent artwork, and it works with background story.  You have the drab look of the lower level, and the pristine look of the upper levels.  The chipped yellow paint on the ladder in the elevater shaft, the natural beauty of the hydroponics lab with the large open window looking into space, the large brown CO2 tanks, and the awkard round thing that turns them on...the entire game has so much detail in the artwork - I dont know how the designers knew how to make it seem so real.  All the characters have different personalities that fit their jobs so well.  All of it reminds me of the way that different people worked together when I was serving on a ship in the US Navy.  The girl in waste processing who is tired of getting reminded of how to do her job when someone forgets to open the valve outside of the main room.  The security personell who stir their drinks with the stun batons, and break them, and the guy in the engine room who gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥becasue he has to fix them.  There is so much stuff like that going on.  And that's just the background.  The actual game plays great.  Even on my 13 year old single core machine.  Figuring out stuff is a challange, there is a lot of items and rooms and things to keep track of and sort through.  I've gone back and played through many times.  I write down names and notes to better understand the story, and the people.  Some of the tech in it is raw, basic stuff that is fun to work with, like the terminal computer, or like the card reader / encoder.  The music and sound effects are excellent.  I like turning up the volume on my 200 watt / per channel system, and clicking on a locked door over and over again to here the sound effect.  The locked CO2 absorbers have a really good sound too.  The voices of the characters are awesome.  The voices, and the way they say stuff, you can tell that the developers hired a bunch of different actors to get it right.  The medic, who has to tell someone that they have a day to live due to a lethal radation dose, but seems to get excited in the next sentence when she's explaing the technology, and that guy who is dying, OMG, you get to hear him giving updates as he runs around the ship trying to fix it, running into a hopeless situation that gets worse and worse, but he's pushing through the pain with an inredible sense of duty...I just keep on playing the game and listening to all of these lines over and over again.  I highly recommend this game."
76561198018473081,Not Recommended,270230,29805560,Posted: 9 February,all,tmacwms2,"It was a tossup whether to recommend this game, or not.  It has good features, a good idea, an interesting story line and development, but there are some improvements needed for it to be highly recomendable, or as good as other games of its genre.In summary, I give the game high marks for artistic merit and story, but low marks for several areas of technical execution.  The mousing was problematic, and movement feed was actually slowed to visible frame jerks in one area.  (I have an Intel 3.2 Ghz Quad Core i7 on an ASUS Rampage III MB.  IT is not slow. This program is inefficient in its execution.)The worst drawback is that there is too much time spent in what old-school gamers used to call ""pixel hunting"".  The game has ""hot spots"" where one can interact, and NOT ONLY are they not easy to find, they are easy to overlook.  I'd guess that the game engine is at fault.  It is unwieldy and slow, overusing, and inefficiently handling computing resources, such that a player can swing past one of the hot spots without the guide icon even reacting to it.   Mousing control and sensitivity is wonky - even with a ""setting"" for ""momentum"".  The game acts like it has a novocaine block interfering with ""feeling"" one's way with a mouse - - - making pixel hunting by ""feel"" even more difficult.There were a number of puzzles and a good story-line progression via the puzzles.  (The puzzles themselves were not difficult nor illogical: the steps were to find the piece to overcome blockage or whatever does not work, install piece, turn on equipment / open access, push button, search around again for  next ""way to proceed"").  I noted user comments about ""could not find anything to interact with"", and I got stumped in a couple of places, not because I could not figure out what was needed for the next step, but because of areas I had searched ""completely"" and failed to find the one piece of gear obligatory to fix equipment.  Each piece that could be found had to be found in order to solve each puzzle.  Again, technical execution was poor: finding pieces was one item at a time, and every single item that could be found was critical to resolving one puzzle, or to achieving the next step.As an illustration of what I mean about problematic game design, imagine four identical cabinets, each with the outline of a service access, only one of which will react to the guide icon, or which can be opened.  So the user checks one access, notes inability to interact, or checks and notices no reaction on three out of four, or, with the wonky ""momentum"" behavior, zero accesses show any reaction to searching.  (*It would be much better game design if each and every access would open, with three out of four empty.*)   Some time later, after referring to a walkthrough, the thought is that, ""I need to comment on that.  This game has so much good in story and art that they need to improve this, treating it as if it were a 'bug'.""Spoiler: The yellow data-stream visits were where the game engine jerk-frame-stepped on my machine, and reacted to mouse clicks as it it were being poked with a stick, from a distance.  Too much data thrown at a bus at a time.  If I would have to overclock because of something this - spare - (compared to something like ""Witcher"") then IMHO, the program is at fault.Ultimately, because of the technical deficiencies that interfered with game flow, I do not recommend this game - at its current price - because of good games with better game flow (at lower prices) that are its competition.  I WOULD recommend a ""version 2"", at this price, with an upgrade to improve the single-item puzzle dependency, unreactive most everything unrelated to specific puzzles, and problematic pixel-hunting ""momentum"" glitch."

I reached out to DEVs and gave them crashlogs, but they couldn't figure it out and no solution was ever made and this was a very long time ago, money well wasted, with that said: anyone interested in suing this company? This game is unplayeable and I would like my money back! Going through the civil options now.PS: basic specs, win 7 64, 12gb ram (corsair), 1tb hdd, 2x 2gb radeon crossfired = 4gb (tried just running the one to no avail also), i7, asus sabertooth board, no exceuse and no reason for this low end game to be acting up like this, nice try on the possitive reviews people who have minimum play time LOL, bottom line is you took my money and gave me broken software, I can't play this at all!"
