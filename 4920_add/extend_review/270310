It's an alright dialogue-driven adventure game where some of the dialogue is sung, like a musical. However, most of the singing is pretty bad and off-key. This might be a reference to how autotuned mainstream music is nowadays, a topic that the game touches upon. Intentional or not, it did make my ears bleed a bit. The clay models used to depict the characters are hideous and the stop-motion only has a few frames so it never really feels authentic. The story is nothing to write home about, a short slice-of-life about gender equality and a bad economy (and autotuned pop music). Game is quite short too. Took me less than an hour and a half (that's less time than what is required to get the steam trading cards for the game)."

Me, I found it boring.  There's no challenge when you can only click what they let you click when they let you click it, and your clicks can't affect the outcome of the game.  You're a spectator here, not a player.  I would describe this as an interactive music video rather than a game.  You will spend 80% of your time watching shoddy claymation figures (an aesthetic choice, I assume, rather than a lack of skill... I hope) talk-sing tuneless songs with straightforward, uncreative lyrics.  The aesthetic was half my motivation for purchasing the game, but I have far less appreciation for it now that the whole experience feels lackluster, and lazy.  I'm sure a lot of hard work went into the game, and I don't really mean to disparage the makers, it's just that because the game is so underwhelming it soured me on everything.  Point-and-click games can have depth, and challenge, but here the challenge is enjoying the show.  I couldn't."

,Recommended,270310,9444748,"Posted: 12 March, 2014",all,hellafun,"I cautiously recommend this, cautiously only because it's not a game for everyone; if you're in the right audience though, it's a hilarious and fun, although short ride of an adventure game. It's a game about wierdos, for wierdos, presumably made by wierdos.Although there are multiple endings (which seem to be determined only by the final choice), the game itself is pretty short. A single play-through takes about an hour. The game mechanics are simple but completely workable: you click on items on the screen to get dialogue or action options, or add things to your inventory. Most of the interactions are in the form of (frequently sung) dialogue, although there is some light puzzling, but it's mostly in the form of bouncing between locations as you open further dialogue options.The story is cute and cleverly written. It's also pretty socially consious, but not annoyingly so. For the right audience, there are many clever bon mots and allusions peppered throughout the dialogue. The singing is horrible and off-key... but that's part of the charm. The story revolves around economic depression and autotuning in the music industry. It also playfully touches on gender identity in a way that makes me wish the game had been a bit longer and that had somehow been more of a story point.The graphics... well, I think it's self-evident from the screenshots above. The models and animation are exceedingly simplistic, but they're charming in a Gumby kind-of way. I think the graphics work well in light of the humorous tone of the game, but your mileage may vary.All in all I enjoyed the game, and hope this is not the last we see of Dominique Pamplemousse. If you like quirky, cleverly written off-beat games, give this one a shot, especially if it's on sale. But if you find out-of-key singing and simplisticly built and animated clay models to be grating, spend your money and time elsewhere."

But I was still intrigued by that game sounding so French (I mean, Dominique is also used in French and Pamplemousse is a fruit). After getting it, I decided to try it. Besides, it's not a heavy file and I'm still trying to run after all my backlog trading cards.It's a point and click game in black and white, with characters in... well, you know the stuff that you can use to model? Well, the animation is really well done even if they chose to add a grainy film. But while Dominique Pamplemousse is a short game with two endings, the real originality is that 90% of the dialogue are sung. And in tune with the music.Besides, even if the voice actors aren't The Voice, it's not breaking your ears because of false notes. Besides, the lines are funny so... And the credits are also original as everyone who backed the project has their names being spoken, rather quickly.Anyway, for $4 dollars, you're not ripped. Don't expect to be the game of the year but still, a little indie crowdfunded game that is enjoyable."
,Not Recommended,270310,16630057,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,Lin,"I can't in good conscience consider this a good game I can recommend, but it was interesting watching it fail at what it's trying to do, and at least it's an original concept.The only way I can describe it is as a stop motion musical in a point & click framework. It mostly fails at all these three things, mainly by looking, sounding and playing as the work of an amateur. The art style is distinct, but the stop motion isn't all that good. Still, it's charming. The music and highschool-musical-theater singing are also kinda charming, at least once you realize that the singing is off key and rather bad ""on purpose"", but you still can't call them good. The point & click elements are barely there, with no real choices and no real puzzles, just serving to move you forward in the story.I think what really tipped this over to no for me was the story. It's very much on the nose. It's got some points to make, and instead of building them organically into its storytelling, it just repeats them over and over. We are never really allowed to empathize with the characters: Instead of watching them deal with the world and its problems we are being told what their problems are and are expected to feel something from that. Good storytelling doesn't really work that way. So if one of the goals of the game was to make us think about gender and the economy, it very much falls flat. Instead of sounding humorous and lighthearted as it seems to attempt to, it feels awkward and preachy.So an interesting little amateur experiment, the first commercial game of a single developer working on their own, trying out a relatively novel idea. I didn't regret the cup of coffee I paid for it with the discount, because the aesthetic is charming and  because it didn't overstay its welcome, but that doesn't mean it's a good game."

When I first saw this game in the Steam Store it had mixed reveiws. But this game is not all that bad. Yes, there are bad things about it, that's why there are negative reveiws, but I must say the game was worth the money I spent on it.The bad traits of this game are clearly and without doubt, bad things. There's no arguement that makes the bad traits go away, but the good traits do outweigh it. Firstly, the game is quite short, surprisingly short. This SHOULDN'T be a surprise though, when you think about how hard claymation is to do, how long it takes, and it's clear that the game makers put a lot of effort into this game, just not enough to make it a full length game, and obviously the time  also depends on how good you are at completeing the game.Secondly, the voices, Dominique Pamplemousse is about singing, about the music industry and opera. The bad singing voices at the start of the game are really cringeworthy, they make you feel uncomfortable, because we are not used to listening to people sing normally, and this game perfectly demonstrates that, (which is one of the reasons I love it!) it shows that some people sing normally. The singing is not so much bad, as normal. After a few minutes of the characters all singing you get used to it, and playing a game with an opera sort of stlye can get quite enjoyable, when you realise the voices aren't really THAT bad. And it's such a special experience seeing someone in a musical type setting who doesn't have a strangely perfect voice.The game makes a lot of claims. It claims that it is a game about gender, and economy, which it really isn't about that much. Yes, the protagonist is non-binary, and appears to express their thoughts about this, and having all the rest of the characters confused about the protagonist's gender. It is clear that this game planned for this to be a big theme, but it didn't really turn out that way, because the game is clearly too short for them to have any discussions about gender or even the economy.Dominique Pamplemousse does seem to have some bad things about it, but it is really worth buying, as it is a beautiful claymation game, and I really am in love with any type of claymation, or any game made with real life materials. This game really has some nice subtle discussions on auto-tune and the music industry, which is not a common plot for video games to have. This game is also in black and white, which is another rare thing for video games, as video games are too advanced to have really gone through a black and white period (if you don't count the time when games could only be in two colours) as televisions did.One last little touch on this nice game, which barely has anything to do with the game, is that it has DLC that you can buy that will give you the sheet music, and sheet music is such a lovely thing to buy as DLC, which is really the whole reason I bought it, but I enjoyed it past the sheet music. This game isn't really that expensive and not really that long, but if you have around $5 you should think about buying it."

Most lines are done in the form of a song in time with the background music. While an interesting idea, I couldn't quite get into that. The visuals are definitely very interesting, too, very unusual. There are plenty of ideas put into this game that I could enjoy, but were just not quite done in a way that I could personally enjoy. But with a clear non-binary protagonist, which is a very nice plus, as an agender person myself.I only recommend this game, because there's no middle option, and I would say that you should at the very least give it a try,"

There is no in between.I happened to love it. It's a quirky point-and-click game where you place as a detective who can't pay his rent. I can't really say much else without spoiling the game. Almost every line is the game is sung. The singing is off pitch but can be pretty funny. The game itself is actually pretty funny. You will either enjoy almost every second of the dialogue and music or hate is so much that you can't play it for more than 5 minutes.To sum it up, if you like quirky games that will make you laugh a bit, you will probably like this. If you like serious games, this is not for you. Also, if you don't think you'll be into it, you probably won't be."

Hideously catchy.I love claymation, and even though this is super low-end budget style, I liked the characters and backgrounds.  Animation is not very varied but it gets a... thing of sort... across.After the first scene or so, the overt cheesiness of the constant amateur singing of the majority of the dialogue wore away.  It really is nice how the music score rolls right along and the dialogues always queue up to hit the beat right when they ought to.  It's a neat effect requiring only momentary pause, and feels really natural in a sort of... absurd impromptu musical.  I liked the score quite a bit and, partnered with the timing of the singing, it honestly felt like the most polished part of the game.The plot is admittedly pretty silly and nothing worth writing home about, but it might give you a weird kind of chuckle.The gameplay was very simple, a brief point and click adventure.  I've played a handful of point and clicks, and this one, while it required no massive leaps in logic (which is good), it was far too easy (which is bad).  Regarding variation, there's far more interrogation of the characters (which makes sense given the musical platform) than there are backgrounds to be searched and interacted with.  Finally, there isn't a lick of puzzle element in this game, which I find to be kind of irregular for the genre, but to each its own, I guess.The kicker, it was super short, a shade more than an hour.  (Additional ""playtime"" was spent waiting for card drops.)To sum it up, weirdly catchy tunes, too easy, odd visuals, and too short.Get it on sale if you're feeling frisky, I guess."

It should have been impossible for me to dislike this game, but instead, it ended up being one of the worst I've ever played.  I really and truly wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt, but try as I might, I could not find a single redeeming quality.The first thing that hits you is the singing.  To call the singing 'music' would be quite generous indeed- the choice of notes breaks every musical convention, but that is overshadowed by the fact that the voice actor can't hit a note to save her life.  The rhythm is all but indiscernible, and the rhyming is strained at the best of times.  The fact that they're selling the soundtrack is a smack in the face.The stop-motion is rough as well...  it seems like the developer only chose stop-motion because drawing the characters would have actually been more time-consuming.  There is a fine line between “artistically simplistic” and “shoddy,” and this game qualifies as the latter.The game says it's about gender and the economy, but the only mention of gender is a running gag that nobody knows the gender of the main character. My suspicion is that the developer has some personal opinions on gender ambiguity, and I can sympathize with the sentiment, but it seems tacked onto the game, and serves no real purpose towards the plot.  Games with political undertones have their place, especially in the indie community, but it has to be done well.  In that respect, this game fails miserably.My final advice is this: don't play the game.  But if you do, just to see what it's about, don't allow yourself to think “it's starting out bad, but it'll probably get better!”  It doesn't.  Feel free to quit at any time...  you're not missing anything."

The crude choppy claymation, the characters singing with the quality of a middle school musical, severely shoehorned rhymes, it's something that you'll find charming or downright annoying.Next is the setting, the style is clearly made too look like 1940's black and white crime dramas, and includes most of the tropes. BUT you get these references that clearly place this in present day (twitter, auto-tune, etc.), and the dissonance that this creates is as unique as it is hilarious.All of the plot exposition is in song, which as I've said before you'll love or hate. Each character has their own melody that reflects their personality. The plot itself, however, isn't very remarkable and you'll see the twist coming a mile away.The gameplay is definitely the weakest element of the game, very simple point and click mechanics and puzzles that aren't very difficult to solve, it's just a means to an end to carry the exposition.Oh, and the main character is genderqueer, which I wasn't expecting. The game doesn't really make this a main part of the story or anything, it's just a passing fact, which I found pretty cool. And the way they deflect other characters' prodding question as to their sex/gender is both masterful and hilarious."

If it only happened occasionally it would still be ok,  even slightly funny...but when almost every single conversation is sung ( and there is a lot of talking) it gets a little grating ...that said I was willing to plough through regardless just to see how the story ended, and I'd guess I got about halfway, but then the game crashed and exited unexpectedly and I hadn't saved for awhile.... I'm still trying to work up the resolve to replay back to where I was before and continue....Its not all bad (although not great either),  its good points are its quirky and the style has a certain strange charm.....but for the sake of your ears I'd  play in short bursts if you do decide to give it a try and FOR THE LOVE OF SANITY remember to save after progress is made, just in case."

What if i ask, if you played a Point a Click Musical game. If you answered no to both of those questions i wouldn’t be 100% surprised. Dominique Pamplemousse is probably the first of it’s kind that i have ever seen. A point and click detective musical game. it’s sort of hard to picture it while i even write it down; and I’ve played the game. But Dominique Pamplemousse has heart thats heading towards the right direction of innovation, creativity and a bit of nonsense.First of sure Dominique Pamplemousse is NOT a fun game to play. It is as basic as a point and click game can be. You see something out of the ordinary and “boom!” you click it. The only difference in this game, is that almost ever dialogue is sang in a musical tune. Crazy as it sounds the game does have plenty of character. Although it seems that there is only one voice actor for ALL 9 or so characters, you can tell that the developer of this game had a blast making it. As i said earlier the game is all animated in clay. As odd as it is, the animation sorta fits with the musical theme. sorta not that great. There isn’t lip moving when the characters talk, instead they just move the mouth up and down over and over. The singing in the game is extraordinarily terrible! A lot of off keys, and most of the time it feels like the singing is forced into saying words really quickly just to keep up the tune.Aside from all of that i was really quit interested in the story. Sure a lot of points the story is very cliche, but once the game was over i was feeling for some more Pamplemousse action and of course singing. I hope the developer doesn’t quit on this style of game. Unfortunately we live in a time where there isn’t as many creativity in video games as there use to be, and this game really brought a smile to my face to know it’s not gone. I’m glad a game like this exits and i hope to see more, but maybe next time, i would like it longer then 1hr and of course with more voices.I definitely want people to play this game, it’s $5 right now for the deluxe edition which includes the SHEET MUSIC (come on, how many games come with sheet music) and soundtrack. As i said, i WANT people to play this. I don’t expect people to like it and i understand but it just seems like a game, personally to me, that i did not want to miss."

However the price is fitting for the amount of content.While it is a point-and-click there isn't really an inventory system like most adventure games and almost no puzzles.

However, what we have on hand here is Dominique Pimp-...Pampel-...Pumpernick..Whatever. A Flash game created by an independant games designer with an ear for catchy tunes and memorable lyrics.This game is presented in the style of clayfighters 64, or The Neverhood, with a heavily Noire-ish turn and grayscale colouration. The character figurines are rough, simple and yet manage to be recognisable and easily identifyable. This is helped in no small part by the voice acting, with varied voices provided for all the characters. While certain characters' voices might fall apart in some musical segments, on the whole, the song fragments are well-written and do a fine job of explaining the situation or the topic presented.The story follows Dominique, the PI of indeterminate gender with an effeminate voice on his/her mission to find a missing pop star. The story does play into some twists and turns, and while some of them are obvious, or heavily foreshadowed, none of them are jarring with the story. The game is heavily linear, though, with only a single solution present to each puzzle until the ultimate choice at the end. So unless you wish to trawl for trading cards, there's very little reason to replay the game.if you like musicals, or games with a certain sense of silliness about them, then this game may be for you, if you can forgive the fact it's coded in flash. (encoded rather loudly, I might add) For veteran point-and-click gamers, though, it will ultimately prove to be a relatively shallow entry into the genre, carried somewhat by a fun and catchy musical score.My positive reccomendation, then, does have some caveats to it. If you play an instrument, splurge on the sheet music for a few short pieces to play."

,Recommended,270310,9436387,"Posted: 12 March, 2014",all,Believe_In_Steven,"Dominique Pamplemousse reminded me of of the investigation portions in the Phoenix Wright games. It's the type of game where it's more of a visual novel, with not much in the way puzzles or logic tricks that you would expect from the average point-and-click adventure.  There are often moments where characters are having a conversation, and you are essentially just clicking the ""next"" button to hear the rest of it.This is by no means a bad thing, though. A video game format can be used to deliver a story in a more nonlinear way that wouldn't be possible in any other medium. Just don't go in expecting much challenge.The story itself actually had me pretty entertained and interested all the way through, with the twists and mysteries in the story being pulled off surprisingly well. There were also a few clever lines that ranged from making me smile to letting out a little chuckle.I really enjoyed the musical element of the game. There's background music on each screen, and on some dialogue options, the characters will sing their lines in time with the music. The singing itself can be a little off-key at times, but I honestly enjoyed that. It added some charm. I'd really like to see the ""singing along with the background music"" done more in games. The background music is also really charming by itself, and I rather wish the soundtrack available for purchase would have included the instrumentals.The game's description says it is a game about ""gender and the economy"", and while these subjects are touched on a few times, it's usually little more than a mention, and doesn't end up affecting the plot at much, which was a little disappointing. The game is really more about corporate intrigue and the music industry.Dominique Pamplemousse is a fairly short game, clocking in at a little over an hour for me, and zero replayability, but for only five bucks, I would recommend it if you like mysteries and visual novels."
