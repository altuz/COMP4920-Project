,Recommended,270490,12702400,"Posted: 30 October, 2014",all,cimerians,"Forest of Doom is a gamebook originally released as a paperback in the 80's under the Fighting Fantasy Gamebook series. The game mechanics, text and all of the art from the book itself is intact and laid out very well along with some music to set the mood (which can be turned off).For those who are not familiar with gamebooks, they are literally a cross between Dungeons & Dragons and Choose Your Own Adventure books. You ""play"" the game while reading the book and choosing different paths with usually a goal to reach in the end. You roll up stats for your character: Skill, Stamina and Luck and also keep track of your equipment on a character sheet. An automap is also featured and very helpful on subsequent playthroughs, because beating these books on the first try is extremely rare.Combat is done by rolling dice adding your Skill score and comparing it to the creatures result. Higher score hits. This is repeated until someone wins. Other factors come into combat as well...items, luck, escaping, multiple enemies etc. The game can be quite difficult in later parts of the game when creatures tend to be a lot tougher but by then the hero is usually quite capable for themselves.Most books tell a typical D&D like story and sometimes items or quests are involved to resolve a mystery or defeat some evil foe. The books were quite popular in the 80's and have had a recent resurgence, these games originally appeared on tablets and only now are making their way onto Steam.As a final note, I can't recommend these games enough especially for old school RPG players out there. There's nothing quite like sitting down for the night to unwind and relax and playing\reading these on a big screen TV....along with a nice bonus...achievements! A dream come true for me. Excelsior!"

That means you have to read through the entire adventure and from time to time there's an image that's relevant to the situation.If you don't like reading, then you should stay away from this game, otherwise, if you like visual novels and rpg's; go buy it. It's worth it.Depending on how you play, the game can be rather challenging, but satisfying. There's a lot of combat and many treasures to be found. Some may aid you and some may.., well, do something else.An important thing about this game is that it stands or falls with your own imagination. It's just as good as your fantasy and as such it's rather complicated to say if it's a good or bad game.For my own taste I say it's a good game and fun to play."

This series of books defined recreation during my childhood 30+ years ago. I have no idea whether or not this product would be appealing to someone who lacks the nostalgic bliss that I have regarding this series, as it is basically a CYOA book with some 'lite roleplaying' concepts borrowed form tabletop gaming. Dice, stats, equipment tracking...all of these things are faithfully recreated here along with the original artwork.  But for people in a certain age bracket or for younger gamers who want a taste of how we amused ourselves before the advent of the internet and couldn't get a DnD group together...this is a perfect taste of the FF gamebooks of yore."

Where do I start?  The music is decent - not my cup of tea, though some may enjoy it (it's certainly thematic).  All of the old artwork has been not only retained, but enhanced with color, and (in the case of the main menu screen, and perhaps others I haven't seen yet) subtle animation.  The parchment-style rendering of the text is a nice touch.The interface is easy to use, and the creators understand their users.  The game supports the use of unlimited bookmarks to simulate how you used your fingers back in the old days!  The graphics and sound effects further enhance the atmosphere of the game, although they aren't obtrusive on what is simply a text-based game.  The game comes with extras written by co-creator Ian Livingstone himself, about the history of Fighting Fantasy and the creation of Forest of Doom.Anyway, I appreciate the TLC that Tin Man and Livingstone brought to the project.  I hope this makes enough money that we see more of these.  I can't wait until Deathtrap Dungeon, Freeway Fighter, and other alliterative titles are released!  Also, the Sorcery! series...keep em coming, guys."

Playing the game was both a nostalgic delight and a fun, exciting interactive experience slightly reminiscent of playing ""Citadel of Chaos"" on the C64 many years ago.TinMan Games have done a fantastic job of reproducing Ian Livingstone's classic extremely faithfully; I was able to find my old maps and utilise them to complete the game in around an hour. Combat rolls are represented with actual dice; white for the player and red for the monsters, enabling a quickly understood and resolved outcome. The musical track is suitably atmospheric and doesn't outlive its welcome.I very much like the inclusion of a ""Hardcore mode"" for experienced players where no provisions are allowed and initial player statistic rolls are lessened. (You get only 1d6+4 for your skill stat for example...) this added a dimension of challenge to a familiar story. However, amusingly I ran into a bug at the encounter with ""Quin the Arm-Wrestler"" and found myself with 68 stamina going into the next encounters, which trivialised reaching the conclusion of the book.It was a pleasure to support the developers and I look forward to seeing more of their work.Recommended to Gamebook, Fighting Fantasy fans and those looking for an interactive reading and single player role-playing  experience."
,Not Recommended,270490,16327573,"Posted: 12 June, 2015",all,dpvhWYnpIwNT8BPQAOc9,"I wanted to like this game, but I simply cannot. I loved the good old series fighting fantasy books by livingstone, however, I feel the devs have chosen a really poor book to begin with as the writing is too simplistic and predictable. Warlock of firetop mountain was always one of the favorites among fans of these books and would've captivated many more people than what this forest of doom could, deathtrap dungeon, even city of thieves.The game uses unity engine which seems unecessary, adds very little originality to the book it is based on, illustrations are low res, theres very little content for its price tag, and the music is absolutely godawful. The music was an extreme annoyance to me as I was trying to read the book and concentrate on the narrative when the music is just blaring trumpets into my ears, I had to mute the music because it never stopped being loud.I think if the devs put some thought into this game and think about how they can bring an old adventure book into the attention of modern pc gamers, they could achieve delivering a great experience to their customers. Also, warlock of firetop mountain is just a much better story.However, if you;re looking for a game based on an adventure book then I would recommend looking at Joe Dever's Lone Wolf game which is also on steam for a similar price but is considerably superior."

Losing 20 consecutive dice rolls is NOT cool. (I'm talking to you, Ape Man).It's cheap and shallow with almost no strategy involed, but opened my eyes to the existence of gamebooks (I was born in 1991). I cannot say I regret the purchase at full price. Just don't expect it to blow your mind and appreciate it for the cultural value."

Although you'll undoubtably have to play it through four or five times before you see everything, it's still a very short game with little content.  The creatures are stereotypical of this genre, but you must remember this is based on an old novel from the days of D&D.  We didn't have the crazy monsters which we have now.I'm not sure if the game is worth the money I paid, even if that amount was lower due to a Steam sale.  I expected this game to be as long as a Tolkien novel with thousands of different paths and events.  This is more like a single chapter.In the end, I do recommend it for a quick play through, but wish I had referenced the game before purchasing.  At least to the game's credit it offers a free-roaming option so that I may re-read every possible option without fighting."

Recommended when on sale.High production values in graphics, music and sound effects makes this fun to play, and this one is much better written than the ""Choice Of"" series on STEAM. Those tend to annoy me because I get asked questions about the nature of reality itself, e.g. ""what is the weather like on the day you start your adventure?"" or ""who just called you on the phone?"" instead of thrusting me into a story where I have to react to the reality presented to me. The reality of this story is a nice, cheesy, 80's feeling D&D adventure.Randomized stats and some choice in starting gear early in the adventure add some replayability. Still, the nature of the game medium means it's limited in scope, so I can't recommend these at full price. $2 each during the STEAM summer sale? I'll take all five, please, even the ones in genres I don't normally care for."

These were something like a one-man rpg session, for which you needed only dice, a pencil, paper and the book itself. Froms tart to end you choose what to do, finding new potential foes and treasures at every turn.This game is essencially a simulator of these books. It's more practial, as all the laborous tasks such as rolling the dice every time and noting down every item are now done for you by the game.The game also has nice music and features the original artwork from the book, although in a coloured version this time.For me, this was a very nice dose of nostalgia, and i would recommend this game to anyone who wishes to either remind themselves or find out how an old school rpg book feels like.I should however notify prospective buyers of two things.Firstly, this game if fairly short. You can complete it in just one afternoon, although it will be a very enjoyable afternoon.Hopefully the next titles will be longer.Secondly, like in the original Fighting Fantasy games, your success in the mission depends on your choices, you will need to do certain specific things, otherwise you will fail, so it is important to explore.Final words; Short and Sweet and Nostalgic!"

The book is great but I feel like this is a lazy game. Having the game track my inventory is handy but there is almost nothing additional that takes advantage of the medium, its just a picture of a book. Give me additional artwork, sound effects, interesting combat, themed UI, add a bestiary, I mean do something to justify the existence of this book as a video game.Edit: It has to be mentioned that the price of this game is absurd for the 2 hours of content you get. Definitely get it on sale."

That said it is a bit childish, which should be expected given that we read these books when we were younger. It's a great game for kids to be sure. A+ while I may not play it to the end I have no doubt that the kids will.Thanks for the game ^_^"

I am highly looking forward to others being converted in this manner. I've still got a lot of fighting fantasy books including this one and it was not only a nice nostalgia hit but a new fun way to bring reading back into video gaming where it's a cross between a digital comic book and interactive point & click adventure.Definitely limited in its scope but simple and fun. The music is well suited and cheat option is also good fun when I remember back to my childhood and hold I'd bookmark pages with my fingers just in case I made a wrong mistake.Very keen to see the entire Sorcery series adapted the same way. Worth the price and double so if you read the original books.
