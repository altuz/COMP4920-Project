,Recommended,270550,12702428,"Posted: 30 October, 2014",all,Roland Deschain,"This game is a great arcade-esque style shoot em' up and I adore it. I played for a few hours with a friend and it was a lot of fun but I have a few suggestions to improve gameplay:1. SKILLS-You can put a point after every round into a skill-Skills could be like: accuracy, damage, run speed. and scavenger (get more from cash/supply drops)2. GUN UPGRADES-Pay to get various upgrades/attatchments to your guns-Such as: incendiary (does dmg over time) explosive (hurts more than one target) or like an increase in damage, accuracy or firing speed3.CHARACTERS-We need just a little bit of character development, who is ""The Girl""? Or ""The SWAT""?-I suggest adding MORE characters and giving them each starting attributes depending on who they are like: The SWAT gets a defense bonus due to his bulletproof vest.4.TRAPS-You should add more traps and trap like elements to the game-Such as a bear trap that costs, say, $50 and you could put them in a 1/4 space of a normal tile-Fire traps would be cool5.PALISADES-Palisades should decay with damage and you should have to pay to repair them-The advantage of this would be you could add in palisade damage. As in they do damage to zombies based on how new and freshly repaired they are.These are just a few suggestions that I thought could make this game better, even though it already is pretty addicting.-ZacP.S. Add some detail to the map, just a few cracks in the concrete or litter. Something to make it more immersive.EDIT: Nearly a year later, I played this game again and saw that the devs practically took all my ideas and implemented them and I couldn't be happier! Skills and traps have been added and so have harmful palisades! They also added a couple of aesthetic details to the map! Awesome work guys and thanks for using my ideas :D"

The player is free to choose from 9 unique weapon Yet-Another-zombie-defense-game-gameplays and fight against waves of zombies. The game is simplistic in its mechanics, as zombies become increasingly fast and have more and more health. The game as limited replay-ability as the scene does not change. It is worth to buy this Yet-Another-zombie-defense-game game, if you are looking for a simple co-op game.

The objective is very clear: defend yourself against ever increasing hordes of attacting zombies (hey - that's in the title!). So I went into it, as in quite some of these small and cheap games, I do admit, for the trading cards, and since I love games with Steam achievements. During the first encounters things got on in a rather predictable way. I managed to survive several waves of attack circling around a single lamp-post with nothing but darkness surrounding me. There was the ability to buy new weapons and ammo in between the rounds, but no upgrade possibilities for the weapons, to name but one thing.Also, I could place some fences, but that produced a rather weird result, since the fences can't be turned around so stand as soldiers in a row awaiting the onslaught. And slaughtered I got, out there on my own in the darkness.This morning, I decided to give the multiplayer co-op a go, and made my game open to anyone who wanted to drop in or out. And that made quite a difference: people came and went, staying for some seconds or longer, and suddenly it proved to be quite some fun to blast away at those pesky zombies. I do have to admit I find it difficult to watch other players jumping around like grasshoppers on speed - be a man, stand your ground and shoot!!All in all, a small diversion for the dead moments in between the more serious games, but hey, this game didn't pretend pretend to be anything more than just that.UPDATE - August 2015After coming back to this game after a year, I have to say the developers polished it nicely since then, adding some more interesting weapons and most importanly: zombies can drop extra powers for the player, such as invisibility or invulnerability. These help a lot and make the game more enjoyable. I was pretty impressed that multiplayer still seems alive, and I enjoyed hunting for some more achievements.Recommended: unpretentious but well-made game with some challenging achievements"

The Good.- lots of weapons to use, from pistols to chainsaws and tesla guns;- plenty of buildings from palisades to turrets and mines to place in order to help you survive - and make zombies go boom!- RPG elements (can pick traits to improve like reload speed, extra health, health regen, etc.)- resource management - money and ammunition are all important- 2 game modes - a strategic one, and a brutal one where surviving over 3 minutes is a success of its own- multiplayer with still plenty of active people online- The music - albeit the game has only 2 relatively short music tracks, I love them both. The Main Menu music has that ERA/Enigma vibe, and the combat (level) music is heavy metal kind of the XBlades 1 type.2. The Bad.- repetitive- only 1 map- only 2 music tracksThe Conclusion:An amazingly good game for 49 cents in my opinion, perfect to fool around with to relax and break the everyday tedium, or as a nice filler between your crazy good AAA games. Even if you're a huge cheapskate and think that 49 cents is still money, deduct 24-30 cents from the steam trading cards that you will sell and you get a perfectly fine SP/MP experience for just 19 cents. That's cheaper than a chewing gum, for God's sake. Get this game, have some fun, and maybe come play online with the others as well!"
,Recommended,270550,13057171,"Posted: 23 November, 2014",all,Ult,"Yet ANOTHER zombie defense is a decent entry in the zombie/survival genre despite the over-saturation of zombie games in recent years.STORY & GAMEPLAYChoosing one of three characters, you must survive for as long as possible by constructing and buying resources by day and defending by night either alone, or with friends and strangers up to four players.The game presents you with an assortment of weapons and accessories to aid you in your zombie slaughter. Ideally in zombie shooters the most expensive weapon is the most effective. That concept is no different on Yet Another Zombie Defense: Expensive = Effective. You can either buy weapons during day break at full price, or wait for a discounted sale to hit in later days. You will burn through money fast; therefore sales provide you with an option to cash in on low-price gear. You can effectively create your own “safe zone” through the use of auto-turrets and two variants of palisade walls: Wood and steel - the latter being more durable to zombie attacks. You can have all sorts of combinations, though their effectiveness will be tested in combat.The online portion works just as well as the single player with a drop in/drop out feature. I had some lag drops here and there, even during my own hosted lobbies though not too often that would ruin the overall experience. Players can communicate via the in-game chat box and host is able to kick players who are otherwise trolling or lack contribution. From the several games I played the community is rather active, friendly and helpful which is a major plus.The current offering is satisfying, though for a limited time. The game lacks weapon/fortification upgrades and variation in terms of maps. Once you breach wave 20 you will stop and question whether it is possible to progress any further as zombies become ridiculously over-powered in terms of speed, durability and damage. Future updates are promised by the developer (most recent being 14 August 2014) possibly free of charge, therefore it would be nice to introduce additional features to build on the current game.I only played this game with an Xbox controller, therefore cannot comment on the functionality of keyboard and mouse. Xbox controls handled well without any problems.GRAPHICS / ART STYLEAesthetically nothing impressive. The character and zombie models are almost identical to those in Garry’s Mod. Delivers an entertaining game of mindless zombie killing.AUDIOBetween 4-5 different tracks; nothing major in terms of variety. Some sound effects were off-sync – i.e weapon shots and zombie growls.OVERALLA fun but limited zombie shooter with a not-so-ridiculous price tag. In dire need of additional content to bolster its current offerings.PROS+Two modes which can be played alone or co-op + supported by leaderboards.+Nice assortment of weapons and tools to change gameplay.+Ridiculously cheap.+Developer is opposed to the idea of charging players for additional content (DLC).CONS-In dire need of additional content – especially map variations.-Unexplainable lag in single player and online.-Some sound effects off-sync."

,Recommended,270550,22958909,"Posted: 13 May, 2016",all,Its_Oli | UK,"Yet Another Zombie Defense is as the title suggests, a zombie defense. I can't really say much about this game, but I guess I'll start at the price. This game is quite affordable at the price of £1.59, although I got this in a sale for £0.39, and I'd say that it's most likely worth it. The game's design isn't unique or out of the norm, but it doesn't go to say that it's a bad game, at all. The zombies work well and don't bug from my experiences so far, nor do the items for sale (guns, barricades, turrets, etc). However, there was an issue that happened to me a few times, and really annoyed me. After 'daytime', when the night starts and swarms of zombies attack, occasionally your character would not be able to move or equip any weapons other than the starter weapon, the pistol. Only being able to use the starter gun and look around isn't good, especially if you've progressed really far by yourself; just a side note, the map isn't really that large. I'd love to see a new map added that was much larger and had run down buildings in which you could put turrets in.The Co-Op is good. There's Multiplayer, Singleplayer and Local Co-Op, the Steam Trading Cards, Leaderboards and Full Controller support add to why I believe this game is good. There are 3 Characters, the 'SWAT', 'Boy' and 'Girl', which aren't too imaginative and do not have any personalities. There aren't many online lobbies, but playing with friends or hosting a lobby is still pretty fun. To add to that, there are 3 game modes, all of which I like.I'd recommend this for people looking for a quick game to pick up and play; like I previously said, there's not a whole lot to say about this game, it's not bad, but it doesn't stand out well. I enjoyed playing this game myself and would recommend this game to those considering buying it."

If you are good enough to trick the system with your base you will go all the way trough the first 20 nights or so. Then it becomes more challenging.TheEndless Nightmode instead is definitely a zombie shooter and you need to be very skilled to go over several hordes.Last mode isDeathmatchin which you'll have to play against an opponent while you and him are facing zombies hordes.Major improvements I would adviceIn Endless Mode you should""save up"" weapons and ammosso if you find a weapon you don't have to lose the previous one you were using.In Defense mode the building system should be improved:it's pretty hard and tricky to remove barricades.In Deathmatch thedrop rate for the losing player should be increasedotherwise if a player starts to win he will be advantaged.Open the game to modders! This will create a new fan base who will eventually build maps, weapons, characters, skins, textures, new zombie types and new modes as well!Minor improvements I would adviceI'm looking forward to somegraphic adjustments, otherbug fixes(e.g. you get spawned out of your base so you need to be clever when you build or you'll be spawned out of your walls!), newgame modes, and a bit of astorymodewith funny dialogues and interactions (e.g. Blood and Bacon).Final Score: 8/10You can get it for 50 cents and play with your freinds for several hours.

,Recommended,270550,15877331,"Posted: 17 May, 2015",all,Xpliciit,"Saw this was £0.39 on Steam (75% off) and thought YOLO how bad could it be!This game is actually pretty good for a small simple game that it is. The goal is to survive hordes of zombies trying to kill you and you have some variety of weapons and defenses to help you.There are two game modes, Defense and Endless Night.DefenseFirst of all you can choose to play solo or allow others to join you when choosing this game mode or you can choose to find a game hosted by another player. Playing with others does help survivability however only the host can buy items such as walls, weapons, turrets and ammo.You start with only a pistol to defend yourself and earn $ by killing zombies. You can buy weapons, walls and even turrets which can have any weapon mounted on them as you see fit. You do need to make sure that you buy ammo for all of the guns that are in use however because turrets will be useless if they are not shooting because of ammo shortages. In the later levels repairing walls and resupplying ammo can start to get very expensive since the zombies also progressively get faster, tougher and stronger.The area you have to build is a little smaller than the edge of the map where the zombies will be spawning and you have a single lamppost in the center of the map providing some light. The very edge of the map is an invisible barrier and zombies will just spawn instantly so can occasionally block you if you happen to be running the edge of the map.Lastly the items that you can buy to help your survivability sometimes can be bought slightly cheaper because they go 'on sale' which can be helpful but sometimes it can take a while for them to do so, in which case it might be more viable to buy them at their full prices.Endless Night ModeIn this mode you can also choose to play solo or allow others to join you when choosing this game mode or you can choose to find a game hosted by another player. Again playing with others can help survivability but in this mode you cannot build defenses, you can only run around so make sure not to run into each other with a horde of zombies either side of you and get trapped!This game mode runs 'endlessly' until you die, there is no daytime in which you can buy weapons or defenses or ammo, there is just one single night that lasts until you die. You can however pick up weapons dropped by zombies upon their death but the ammo is very limited for these so you will run out and your pistol (which has infinite ammo) will be pulled out again.OverallGreat game for only £0.39 that i bought it for, does have achievements that took me only 5 hours to achieve but its a very simple fun game and for that price you can not go wrong!For reviewing completeness the game does also have Steam Badges if you are interested in those too!"

,Recommended,270550,13185749,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,Fantasy,"""Yet Another Zombie Defense"" is a co-op game where you and your friends have to kill zombies on a small map, that is the only point ... but that is pretty fun ! Up to 4 players can fight together, using a man, a girl or a member of the SWAT (the only difference is the skin, nothing else).There are two modes.The first one is the defense mode. You have to survive waves of zombies over and over until the end of your lives. Each time you kill a zombie, you get some dollars plus from time to time money, medic kit (enables your team to recevor health) or ammo (you need to have at least one weapon to get ammo, that does not take into account the pistol that you have at the beginning because you have infinite ammo for this specific weapon). After each wave, you recover your health but the zombies get stronger : they will deal more damage to you if they bite you, they will be faster and you will need more and more hits to kill them.In order to survive, you are able and you have to use your money between each wave. You can buy different weapons (rifles, shotgun, flame thrower, tesla, rocket launcher, laser, ...), but always remember to have enough ammo tu use them ! Tip : I think the best way to go is to buy only one weapon so that, when a zombie drops ammo, you only get the adequate type of ammo. If you have two or more weapons, you are going to drop at random two types of ammo, and if you are looking for one specific kind, you might be unlucky and get the other one.You can also buy barricades (wooden and steel) and auto-turrets and place them on the map, almost wherever you want within a medium circle from the center of the map. You can build up to 5 turrets, and for each of them, you have to buy and mount a weapon on it to get it active. Them, each time the turret shoots a zombie, it will use your ammo, so be carfeul with your stock ! The idea is to protect your turrets with barricades because zombies can destroy them, and since they are pretty expensive, you have to keep them alive.Remember that only the host of the game can buy stuff and place items. You can ask for specific weapons, but the host has the final decision. I think that you should spend the first four or five waves killing the zombies with your pistol (which is free thanks to inifinite ammo), then you are likely to buy the weapon you like the most. There are also ""sales !"" : at random, between each wave, some items are going to be cheaper (-25% I guess), so you might want to wait if you are looking for a specific item and maybe get lucky after the next wave, unless you die ...In the end, you have to get the highest score you can to get your name on the leaderboard.The second mode is the endless night. As indicated, there is only one wave of zombie, but there is no end to it ! No money on this map, no barricade or even turret to build, you have to kill zombies with weapons. There is a lot of zombies and they can drop weapons : as soon as you pick one of them, you have to use it, you cannot get your previous weapon back (unless you drop it again). The aim is to survive as long as possible, so try to gather medic kits when you need one of them, and never stop running !To conclude, this game is pretty fun, maybe it is lacking a little bit of content, but with two modes, Steam trading cards and 18 achievements to unlock (5 hours should be enough to get them all), it is worth its price, which is quite low currently :)"

After each wave, you can buy ammo or guns.Here are the flaws. The lobby leader holds all the money and can buy the guns for the team, build walls, and turrents.So if you get a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who wants to not buy anything, he can start next wave before the team can ask for a new gun or mention low ammo.But if you happen to have a few friends to play with, can be real fun.

There might be a few elements, reminiscent of Tower Defense strategy, but success owes much to the player’s ability to react quickly via the use of their hands.Working on a wave basis, each in game night pits the player against an increasingly large, tougher and faster horde of zombies.The weapon selection is decent, but the fortification side of the game – the purported tower defense – is an absolute snore. Perhaps my expectations for Yet Another Zombie Defense were off-base. I was looking forward to a sharp mix of light tower defense strategy and arcade action, but what I got was a competent but unremarkable dual-stick shooter with sentry turrets and blocks- reasonably fun, but quickly forgettable. Overall 6/10."

,Recommended,270550,13679638,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,A String's Vibrato (Violoncello),"Within the time I've played this game, it helps pass the time. It's like a basic tycoon game in which you can earn money as you kill zombies. As you progress, the zombies become stronger and more lethal. Trying to survive 10 nights might seem difficult enough, but getting at any point past night 10 is difficult if you have less than four people. Trying to get all the achievements can be a challenge and makes more goals to go after in this game. What I liked most about this game is the accessibility to auto-turrents and the ability to mount any weapon on top of them, making them fierce allies if you're able to protect them. My personal favorite weapon is the Telsa Ray, which can attack up to three zombies at once, and is basically an instant-kill gun. I love the idea of ammo sharing and whenever some gains a health pack you get some of it too. It was definitely worth the $0.69 I paid for. Even though I currently only have 2.6 hours on it, I expect to add more, seeing a this is an enjoyable game to play.Some things to know before you play:You can have up to 4 people playing with you.You can customize your server to personnal or to publicThe game becomes harder as you playIt matters where you place everythingThe Rocket Launcher is not a good gunThe auto turrents are VERY usefulAt random nights, there are sales on various item in the storeNever play aloneThe street light is your friendSome thing that could be added:Better assortment of weaponsNew barricadesPossibly new mapsNew charactersNew game mode (Example: A defending mode where you have to protect the street lamp from the zombies.)Few various tweaks on the AIs of the zombiesVoice chat in the gameAnd maybe a few bosses that come out each night during the horde, to add a little spice to the game!I hope this helped you and gave you a proper decision on whether to buy this game or not, but I will say this; It is defininetly worth the amount of money it is being sold for, very fun and low graphics, meaning you can have a fast gameplay on slow laptops, like mine!

76561198123412640,Recommended,270550,13891910,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,Sam Lilly,"Yet Another Zombie Defense is a fairly simple top down twin stick shooter with some tower defense elements thrown in. Basically, you are thown in with nothing but a pistol and fight off a wave of zombies. These are the nights. Then, once they're all dead, it goes into a section where you can use the cash you earned from killing zombies to purchase and build. These are the days. You can buy guns, ammo, turrets to place guns on that will shoot automatically, and walls that can be placed to help stop the incoming waves. During the night stages you can pick up drops from the zombies like ammo crates, money stacks, and full health. Health will come back between rounds, but if run out of it during the night, it's game over. The walls and guns become very necessary for later rounds as the zombies continue to increase not only in numbers, but in speed and health as well. You're going to die. It's just about how long you can survive. Eventually ammo will run out, walls will get destroyed, and you'll be overwhelmed. And that's basically the whole game. Simple, but with possibilities and strategies to try. Oh, and there's an endless mode with is similar except that... there's no day stages.There's also mutliplayer, which is where this game really shines for me. You can play with up to three other people (meaning four players total including yourself). That means four times the firepower, and a game is only over if every member dies so... better odds. Just make sure not to get in each other's way and do your best to cooperate. Playing online is a great way to make this game more enjoyable and interesting, as you can see other people's skills and strategies. I've played much more online multiplayer with this game than single player, and it's one of the few games I actually play online anymore.I also want to mention how cool some of the other things are in this game. It has some neat music, which is nice. The way you can build walls and turrets to create a defensive outpost between rounds is a lot like a tower defense game, and it's a cool way to implement that genre into this top down twin stick shooter type of game. It's basically what I think a new arcade game would be like. I like it.But every game has some downsides. The online can be awfully laggy at times. That can be due to distance, but... it's still a major drag since there's no local co op for this game, another downside. Also, while graphically it looks alright, artistically it is a bit drab. It's a zombie apocalypse, I get it, but that doesn't mean I have to like the dark, dirty look. Just a personal preference thing I suppose. Also, there's this weird system that allows everyone to use the money to buy things in private games with friends, but in random online matches there's no way to do so. Only the host can buy things. It works out alright, but the fact that it's inconsistent is strange to me, and not really explained anywhere either. The heads up would help. Speaking of that, it'd also be nice to get a little warning on the turrets. See, you buy the turrets from the shop and then you can place them. Pretty easy to figure out. What's confusing is that you're supposed to mount a gun on them. This could've been conveyed a little better. Many times newcomers will buy a turret and place it then be confused as to why it won't shoot. Well you have to have another gun to mount on it. And that gun also uses ammo. You start with many extra pistols to mount to them, which is nice enough, but being given a small heads up on a few of these features might have been nice little things to add. Also, there are supposedly more updates coming... but they're taking long than expected as well as longer than announced. So don't base your purchase on new features coming as it's still a bit up in the air. However, let it be noted that, at the very least, more stages to pick from would be very appreciated.It's still a pretty fun little game. Nice for a time killer. Simple. Easy to learn. And for two bucks, it's worth it. Wait for a sale even. I got it cheaper and even I think it's worth the full price. Yet Another Zombie Defense gets a 6/10 for being a fun, simple, arcadey experience in a more modern time."

Even though there are plenty of guns to thin down the horde with, some of them are just plain useless or too expensive to use.The game’s problem is further compounded by the lack of variety, since you only get one map and two enemy types. Sure there are three characters in the roster, but they all play the same beyond cosmetics.The lack of play testing in development showed as well, since there are only a finite amount of zombies on screen at a time, you can cheese out the endless survival mode by circling the map “endlessly” for top scores. Or get lucky with a turret sale and get a much higher score than other less fortunate players in defense mode.If you can look past all that, the game can be pretty fun for a couple of hours.

,Recommended,270550,12737920,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,Domo,"In just the short time I played the game, I do have a few pros and cons to point out.Pros: It's a fun top-down zombie shooter, especially when you can co-op with other players. Endless fun until you're dead, aim to be at the top of the leaderboards.Cons: Unfortunately, there seems to be some major lag when playing with other people online. =( I think the only way this game can be enjoyable and lag-free is via LAN with some real life friends. Some other notes also, I bought the Auto Turret, thinking it's a machine gun turret that'll fire at zombies if they get too close (dunno if it can rotate 360 degrees or not, or if zombies have to be in front of it, or if it can shoot over barricades). But when I bought it, I watched as the zombies went up to it, bashing it, and destroyed it, and it never fired a single shot. =( Is there something we're supposed to do to get it working? Or is it just a broken item? Another problem also is I found the Flame Thrower to be utterly useless. Short spurt of flame, then reload. Short spurt, reload. Never seen a flame thrower with such a small capacity, and when I played one online game with this person, it was just an utterly useless weapon. The shotgun turned out to be the better option as the spread shots would hit multiple zombies better than the flame thrower (also flame thrower doesn't seem to catch zombies on fire, or you just don't see the fire animation on the zombies, so you can never tell if you got them or not).So yea, unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros right now, as I can't think of many pros. It is fun though, and I love how it has trading cards too (selling those should cover the cost of buying my copy of the game). I hope the devs work out some bugs, and polish it up abit. After all, it's supposedly a ""Zombie Defense"" game, where you gotta survive, but at the same time you can build barricades and turrets, you'd think it could be a tower defense game as well. Sadly, what good is a tower defense if the tower (in this case the auto turret) doesn't even work? It's utterly pointless to even have in the game then. =-(I'd still recommend this game to friends, but only in the hopes that this game gets some free updates or even free extra content, then it'd be all worth it.*EDIT* Ha, ironic, I didn't realize it, but there was this small window still open in the backround after I had exited the game. I looked at it, and it was a thank you from the devs for playing the game. It also said if the game became popular and would earn ratings, they will include extra content free of charge, with new weapons and even game modes. That just made my day, thank you devs! =) Though I won't be editing my review on the cons till all noted issues are resolved. XD But I will recommend the game!"

I like the fact that your character gets stats upgrades throughout the run and you don't really have to upgradeaweapon.Even though, I dislike a bit the fact that the weapons in the shop are a bit expensive. You probably have to buy them when they are 'on sale'(random in-game shop discounts) and just ring around the rosie with the zombies untill you get enough money(I have only played for one hour or so, so I don't know what strategies are to be followed). You may be able to upgrade your defense system, but the offensive one will probably be worse.Also, I don't know why the money, temporary stats upgrades and ammo dropped by the zombies disappear so fast. I believe they should stick around a bit more. For example, at the end of the night(or round), when the character stats upgrade menu pops up, it freezes you and you cannot pick anymore items left on the ground.. which sucks.Lastly, the optimization is not so well done. I don't know if it's capped or something, but I can't go above 30fps for some reason. It just.. doesn't go further.Despite this being more of a rant than a positive feedback, I do recommend it because it's really fun, both singleplayer and multiplayer."

It's an overhead twin-stick shooter game where you spend each day shooting zombies who seem to have an uncanny knack for knowing where you are. The game plays on a single, large parking lot with a lone street lamp to keep you company as you gun down masses of ever-increasing zombies who become faster, stronger, and more durable with each passing day. Killing zombies provides you with funds with which to buy new guns, ammo, turrets, and fences (Who's selling these? Ah who cares).The graphics are serviceable. They look like they were designed with the bare minimum. I haven't experienecd any slowdown, so that's a good sign. Collision detection is a little spotty, as it can be hard to tell when you get hit, and fences act a bit weird on how you can walk past them. As for the music, I hope you like combat and build phase songs because those are the only two songs you will ever hear. They're not bad, but you will almost certainly want to put on some other tunes after you've heard them a few times.Endless mode is a nice change of pace for when you get tired of the same gameplay. In it, you cannot purchase anything and must make do with random drops provided by the zombies. It's all kiting the old-fashioned way. Overall the standard game is much more satisfying to play though.The best way to enjoy this game by far is with friends. This game was meant for co-op survival and to that end it does it very well. No matter how good you are you're going to die, as the zombies scale much faster than you. Your cash reserves are pooled together, so it's best to play with someone you can trust, as sometimes strangers are unaware of this fact and spend your cash by accident.So the big question is, is it worth it? Yup, this is one game I can recommend even at full price, just because of how inexpensive it is. The return value in entertainment is quite good, and having friends to play it with makes it all the better. Surprisingly YAZD is updated from time to time, so it can be worth coming back to after a long hiatus to find out what's new.  I rate this game a 8.5/10 for its nice combination of affordability, multiplayer, and fun."

You can try it alone or you can team up with your friends to see how many waves of the undead you can repel, whilst earning cash drops for weapon upgrades, ammo resuply, defences, and other accessories. The zombies get tougher and faster as each wave begins so some sort of strategy might be in order. Do you run circles around them, or do you just hide behind  you defences? The agony of choice.

I would recommend buying this for yourself and friends because it's sometimes hard to play since not many people play. If you have your friends to play with, this would be much more fun.Sum of the gameMax 4 players a gameI highly suggest getting chainsaws for everyone. They're unlimited and kill very quickly up until wave 10~. This is a great way to save money for better weapons and defense.Creator of a game controls all money picked up. You can click "" Buy"" on an item you request to have and it will say that you wish to have said item bought above your characterGun turrets can be useful, but are weak against being attacked. Be cautious having them unprotectedGun turrets are used by placing it and mounting it with a weapon that you have already purchased (it's unlimited ammo on turret as far as I know, with slowish fire rate?)Communicate by pressing ""enter""A great strategy is to try and group the zombies together and kill them by following the edges of the map. Upgrade movement max for this to be best so they can't hit youLast three weapons seem to be the best. Blaster is great but may cause lag especially with multiple people.I don't suggest getting the item-grabbing upgrade unless you reall need it.Be mindful of what weapons you purchase. The more weapons you have, the more you have to switch weapons to get to one you want sometimes which is time consuming. I typically stick with 3 weapons (chainsaw, Tesla, Blaster)Pros:fast paced, lots of options for different strategies, simple to play, fun, nice graphics for being simple, smooth movement and shootingCons:not many people play, sometimes you freeze and can't move until you die, lag can be bad by around night 20 due to so many zombies and shooting, high rise in difficulty as you get to around 20, people don't chat and quit early, people may join your game and not agree how you spend money which may become problematic as a teamSome things I wish would be changed:upgradable weapons and barriers, option to change leader, minor glitches fixed (I've experienced two so far: one where the camera will stick and won't follow your character anymore and when your character freezes at the end of a round and either won't move or shoot until you die)"

On 4th wave you'll have enough money to buy a better weapon (I prefer the Sniper Rifle) or start to build up your camp. Therefore are wooden or steel palisades and turrets where you can mount all weapons.Every wave you evolve more. But the zombies do also. Each property of their damage, life and speed raises by a factor. There are even more effective weapons like a rocketlauncher, the tesla coil or a lasercannon, but the ammo is mostly too expensive or the reload time is quite too long.Another mode is the endless night mode. which you gain after 10 waves of survival. In endless night mode there are no palisades. Weapons spawn by random of killed zombies. Here you must survive 5 min max.The MP is stable and makes fun. Achievements are partly deactivated for MP.

The player gets to build his shelter from zombies during the day and fight 'em during the night. Each zombie killed gives the player money reward plus they have a chance to drop extra cash and some other cool stuff.In defense mode the game requires the player to be wise and strategic in order to get equipped with good weapons for harder levels and to be able to save enough for good defences.Each purchasable item has a chance on becoming on sale randomly by a small amount noticed about 25% for each purchasable item for in-game money.The few minor defects about the game though:1. When purchasing the SMG weapon full price (not on sale) as well as the ammo, ammo shows the price for it - 60 butplayer gets deducted - 80. And when it's on sale it is the other way around, the cost displayed is 80, while actually deducting - 60.2. Some areas of the map is for some reason blocked from deploying mines, I wonder if that's intended or actual bug???Some features to be added would be great:- No explanation or strength of the defences.

Otherwise, I give the game a 9/10 for a low price and fun gameplay.I found this game randomly, saw it was 75 cents for a two pack (ON SALE), and instantly got it thinking it would be only decent, but it's actually really good! This is a very simple game, and as such it is not very difficult to learn the different mechanics. As the title may suggest, this game is about defending yourself from zombies, but it's in a third person perspective and it's done pretty well overall. This game offers two gamemodes, which are Defense and Endless Night (which can be unlocked by getting to night 7 of Defense). The 3 characters are Guy, Girl, and Swat, and they do not (as far as I've seen) have any difference between them. I think it would be cool to add some special characteristics to make the characters different; such as the Guy having more Defense, the Girl having more Speed, and the Swat having more Damage or Firing Speed. Every Night in Defense mode you can buy upgrades like fences or weapons, and so you evolve from night to night. But as expected, the zombies slowly get more challenging too. This game is a masterpiece for the asking price of as little as 50 cents for a copy, and is still fun. For those who have that little amount of money in their steam wallet, I highly recommend getting this game. It's lots of fun.Yet Another Zombie Defense - 9/10"

,Recommended,270550,23108174,"Posted: 20 May, 2016",all,TRU±PlayMaker,"IntroductionYet Another Zombie Defense is a game which puts players versus zombies in a fight for survival on a very simple map. It's a very simple and straightforward top-down, arcadey shooter with a fairly large arsenal of weapons and defensive options to be used. There is a lot of fun to be had with this one, and has some very interesting stategic options to fit many playstyles. Read further to learn more.GameplayThe gameplay of YAZD (I'll refer to it by this acronym) is divided into three sections: Classic, Survival and Deathmatch. One common thing between these three is that the zombies get stronger and stronger over time, which means that no matter how hard you try, you're eventually going to die at some point though you can hold out for pretty long especially with a full 4-man squad. Speaking of which, this game supports a maximum of 4 players in any multiplayer game. Zombies drop ammo, money and power-ups for the player randomly when killed.ClassicYour goal is to survive each night from a horde of zombies that spawn. Each night has more zombies, and their defensive, offensive and mobility multipliers go higher every night meaning that survival is less and less likely each night. To your aid are weapons, pickups and the store. After you complete a night, you can shop from the store which randomly has items on sale. Money is an important resource which you collect from dead zombies, and can be the difference between an impenetrable defense and a failed run.Every few nights you get a skill point which can be allocated to upgrade one of the following: Movement speed, pickup range, health regeneration, health points or reload speed. It's important to identify which particular upgrade path suits your playstyle and stick to it. Survive long enough and you'll get to upgrade them all, but some upgrades are better than others early on.Defensive and Offensive options are plentiful and really cater to multiple strategic playstyles. Want to run around shooting zombies that chase you? Grab an automatic weapon like the uzi. Prefer to snipe out entire lines of enemies? Sniper Rifle. Need an effective area of effect weapon? Grab a rocket launcher or the tesla coil. The combinations are endless, but your money and ammo is not, so always think ahead.SurvivalThis time it's a race against the clock to see how long you can hold out from the endless wave of zombies chasing you. There is no shop here so the only thing that drops are weapons. Good luck collecting them though.DeathmatchI haven't played this one enough to give it a detailed review, but essentially you can now hurt other players whilst having to deal with zombies at the same time. I will update soon.VisualsYAZD doesn't really have much in the graphics department. It's not horrible on the eyes, but it's not very good either. The one map it has is very plain, and the edges of the map are simply black. A lot more could be done visually to give it a better feeling overall, but the devs may not go that direction.AudioThe soundtrack, while being okay, is repetitive and limited. Again, not much worth mentioning here.Summary & ConclusionYAZD is best played with your friends or anyone online for that matter. The fight for survival is a very fun experience, and can lead to some rather tense moments where you're struggling to keep your base from falling as the zombies close in. Playing solo is not really recommended, as there's much less zombie killing action to really enjoy, but you can if you want to. At the price it's easy to pick up and play, and it goes on sale quite often, so it's definitely worth your time and money. For what this game offers at its price:7/10 -Must...Survive...Another...NightIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It also has coop and every game is more fun with a friend, especially a zombie defense game.So after all that and the game is only 1.99, definently worth it!p.s. more items are going to be added soon as stated by the devs and they also said it would be free because they hate DLC just as much as we do, best devs I have ever seen."

,Recommended,270550,18319797,"Posted: 3 October, 2015",all,Paraturtle,"I will rate the two primary factors to this game (Gameplay and Sound) and include a final score below.__________________________________________-Gameplay 8/10 (Very Good)The premise of the game is to survive wave after wave of zombies that increase in Toughness (health), Damage, and Speed. Each kill you earn is money in your pocket, and they regularly drop pick-ups from ammo, limited power-ups, and bonus cash. After each wave you have the chance to build barricades, guns, or turrets to mount guns. After a certain amount of kills, the player can choose from a tier list of upgrades including but not limited to: Reload Speed, Run Speed, Health Regen. After beating a minimum of 7 waves, the player can now play endless night mode in which the entire game is spent during the zombie phase and you progress by picking up weapons the zombies drop and pray to God you won't die.The difficulty in this game is incredibly high. Getting passed early waves is easy but your choice in purchases will impact how far you can get in the long wrong. There's a limit to the amount of money you can make each round, and it's up to RNG to decide how many drops of bonus cash you can get to help buy those extra barricades or that final turret. The micromanagement of your cash is probably the most engaging part of the game, but as most defence games work this way this becomes an incredibly fun part about the game. Zombies have a one track mind and will do everything they can to get their hands on you, and their spawns are quite methodical as they will appear to surround you within a second with only one way out. It's very bullet-hell-ish.The Multiplayer aspect of the game is spot-on and has virtually no issues other than minor connectivity problems that seldom appear.-Sound 5/10 (Average)The audio in this game is quite cheap. The song that plays on loop is bland, landing itself on the sweet spot of, ""This is a constant loop but it's not annoying so I can tune it out white noise."" The weapon sounds feel like an after thought, like the developers forgot that they needed sound the entire time and made quick sounds, leveled them so they weren't abnoxiously loud, and then released the product a little early. However, like the music, they're on a sweet spot of comfortable absence.FINAL SCORE........... 7/10 (Good)__________________________________________Rating System:10 - Fantastic9 - Great8 - Very Good7 - Good6 - Fine5 - Average4 - Bad3 - Very Bad2 - Horrible1 - Apalling"

Graphically, its not outstanding and its only ambience considered is a single lightpost among a dark, barren concrete wasteland. Despite it being beaten within the day, the replay value might be low, considering not much is left to be unexpected, except how long you can last. If you're looking for a quick and simple strategy game, look no further. But if it's the customization and creativity you're after, you might be disappointed, but willing to play for the low price.As an aside, the indie developers send you a message upon exiting the game for support and if you know anything about indie games, they deserve their time in the limelight."

The game itself is the pinnacle of tactical shooters, rivaling games such as Arma 3, and Battlefield 1 through to 4. Its RPG nature allows it to surpass games wuch as The Witcher and Mass Effect. And to top it all off the strategy aspect feels like it came straight out of lego star wars the clone wars battle mode.I purchased this gem for 99 cents and bought it for a friend. We play it every chance we get and it is continues to serve as an excellent option when there is nothing else to play. All that is missing a competitive scene for YAZD, I already class myself as in the top 5 players in the world as my skill with the tesla gun rivals the awping of KennyS so when the dev does add it, it will pro long this titles life span for another 10 hours.In conclusion YAZD is the pinnacle of gaming, it the finest example of how a game is done right.

With the current defense placement system, it can be extremely tedious to add and remove defenses while still retaining your sanity. Also, because the bodies don't disapear until the next wave, the game sometimes lags once you get to the point where you have 100s of bodies on the screen at one time. If the way you place defenses gets tweaked and the bodies fade away after they die it would be perfect."

Can also become a mindless grind after a while, however; I see the developer makes improvements and adds new features every once in a while which I think is great. I hope they continue to do so, there is so much potential for this to evolve in to a really great game. For now, it's a really good get in/out blast away at zombies to kill some time sort of game.

,Recommended,270550,21245610,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,Emperor Eagle,"Firstly I saw this game for an ultra cheap price during the Steam sales.  Then I looked and saw that a few of my friends had it too.  So I bought it thinking that if the game was bad I wasn't going to be very disappointed because of the cheap price.  I downloaded it and realised that it hardly took up any space, that was good.  Or was it bad, small games are often bad.  No, no, this game was great.  I launched it immediately (sort of, a day or two after I bought it, so not really immediately) and the game loaded within seconds.  It came up with a menu full of zombies that were ready to kill you and eat your brains as soon as they saw you.I pushed play.  It was a single player game as I wanted to have a go by myself before I went co-op with others.  Once you press play there are a series of options.  They are the choices of a character ('The Guy', 'The Girl' and 'The SWAT), a game mode (defence, endless night and death match) and the types of players that could join (everyone, friends only and local).  The controls were easy to master and the first couple of nights were pretty simple.  Soon enough I had a few achievements that were super easy to earn.  That's one good thing about this game.  There are easy, medium and hard achievements to earn, all of them will take time but none of them are out of the range of a medium skilled zombie slayer.In Yet Another Zombie Defence I found almost nothing to criticise.  Apart from the facts that some of the settings don't change much like the blood for example.  One hundred percent means you have heaps of blood flying everywhere and spattering on the ground making a mess.  If the blood is on zero percent you will still have heaps of blood flying everywhere and spattering on the ground making a mess.  There is also the problem of being able to walk through some of the barricades but not others in between levels.Anyway, for all of these reasons stated in the many paragraphs I would rate Yet Another Zombie Defence 91/100 for its fun cooperative gameplay and for its easy to use set up (the menu, the default controls and the item shop setups).  It could have better graphics but for the type of game it is, they wouldn't need to be much better.  It is a brilliant game that I would recommend to anyone who likes shooting, strategy and zombie survival games.  Great game."

Now, this is being said in consideration that this is anindiegame, meaining it won't have as good graphics, it may not have original sounds or even soundtracks, and it just overall won't be that one game you always play (sometimes). YAZD however, does not in my opinion fall into the last critique.The gameplay, the bread of the entire indie sandwich, is very straightforward and easy to get used to. You move around with (for gamepad users) the left stick, shoot with right trigger, and aim with right stick. Aiming is pretty on point and you hit your target 98 times out of 100.The sounds should be split into two categories: sound effects and soundtracks. The sound effects are okay, not too many of them and the ones that are there aren't the best, but keep in mind that this is an inide game, right? The actual soundtracks, the music playing as you zombie defend, is the same one every round. While in the main menu and in daytime there is a second soundtrack, but it's kind of corny with the same ""Darkness... is coming..."" opreatic repeated over and over.There is no dlc for this game, meaning when you buy it for $1.99 (or 49 cents, the price i got on sale) you're buying the whole thing. You won't need to drop another 30 dollars on in game currency or costumes of maps - which, and i need to say this, there is only one map, for day and night time. It's a concrete lot with a single street light in the middle.All in all you won't really be wasting your money on this game. It's very addictive and fun to play with friends, especially those who enjoy zombie defense games. It runs very well on a computer like mine, which has an okay graphics card and a processor with two CPUs. YAZD is not the finest game of it's kind, but it's still a fun and worth it's price (even more for sale price) game to grab any day. Get a two pack next time you see it on sale and enjoy it with your best friend :P"

,Not Recommended,270550,11175572,"Posted: 10 July, 2014",all,Ty163,"YAZD is the standard ""Zombie Defense"" gimmick (as made obvious by the title), But there's really only so much enjoyment you can get out of this gimmick, and YAZD just fails to entertain me. I, as many others only bought YAZD because I got a 90% coupon for it. Honestly, YAZD's one of the very few games that I hold Buyers Remorse over. I've spent roughly seven minutes in this game to-date, And in those seven minutes I managed to figure out pretty much the entire game.The gameplay is fairly standard: You are a survivor with a supply of weapons (That you for some reason must purchase) who mindlessly slaughters zombies. Most of the game is spent holding down the Left Mouse Button and strafing around the zombies, And at later stages even strafing becomes useless when the zombies get faster. There are two barricades you can purchase (which I found wildly useless) and a sentry gun (Mildly helpful, But you have to relinquish one of your weapons for it).The graphics (Yes, I know graphics aren't eveything, But still.) are subpar, from the character animations to the lazily done Single level. There's nothing impressive about the barren level, and the only scenery on the SINGLE LEVEL is one lamppost, Which even then has completely terrible lighting.The UI has a rookie feel to it, With current ammo being a confusing yellow bar and health being the standard red bar, Money is displayed in a green font. Honestly, The UI isn't really bad, though that may just be the minimal amount of elements to it.For droppable items, there is a very scant amount of them: Ammo, Health, and extra Money pick-ups. Ammo is fairly obvious along with money, But health just gives you full health off the bat. All three are displayed with the generic sprites that you've seen everywhere.And for sound; I can't really complain about weapon noises or zombie sounds, As you can't really make ""correct"" sounds for them. But the music is just not good, It doesn't sound like you're in a zombie apocalypse, fighting for your life. And with that, There's no ambiance (though, That's probably because of the lack of scenery, Not really the musician's fault).Overall, I honestly cannot reccomend YAZD to anyone in good faith. To me, It feels more like an indie-startup's first project than a full fledged game. I personally feel that $2 is too much for a game where there's nothing but an established gimmick. I sorely regret impulse-buying YAZD just because I saw the price. Oh well though."

The only real reason to play this game is to go for the achievements. Otherwise, it just feels pointless because of how quickly you'll end up getting overwhelmed by the zombie hordes as the rounds progress, and their strength, speed, and numbers increase. Being able to obtain enough equipment to continually survive against them requires some amount of luck - how much money the zombies drop, how much of it you're actually able to collect, and whether or not the shop items go on sale between rounds. Even if you're lucky enough to get good deals and lots of equipment, chances are you'll still reach a round where the zombies just completely overwhelm your barricades and auto-turrets.Rating: 2/5"

Not even a stamina bar.-Mouse movement is just really weird. Actually kind of all the movement.-There are some strange bugs that, even though they are hilarious, cause the game to rate lower: giant legs of your team mates appearing on the screen, getting stuck in palasides...This game is really fun though and I reccomend it."

I got it a couple months back for 49 cents each. Every cent was worth it. One of the most fun games to play with your friends. Just mess around and shoot zombies for a while. What's even better, my friends would troll each other by making a massive hoard chase around one guy, which in the end, he would get surrounded and mauled to death. Hilarious. The gameplay may not be amazing, but the laughs you will get will be worth it. However, I would like to warn people; DO NOT BUY FOR FULL PRICE! The game may be fun to play with friends, but it isn't worth a cent over 49. Here's why:Pros:A lot of fun with friends.Zombie mechanics and gun mechanics make for funny gameplay.Forts are fun to build and get trapped in, and be laughed at by your friends.Very well optimized and absolutely zero bugs.Very easy to connect with friends.Cons:Very amateur.Not fun in solo.Extremely rare updates.I highly recommend Skype for playing with friends (when they are at their homes), it just makes the experience better.Overall, 10/10.P.S. I will be buying more copies of the game if the price drops below 49 cents during a sale."

Hell, you don't even have to keep clicking, you just need to hold down the left mouse button and watch devestation unfold. However, I recommend this game for two reasons. 1.) It's only 2 dollars. It costs less than most games on your cell phone. 2.) It's nostalgic. I don't remember how many times, be it in high school or even college, that I would play certain tower defense games that just involved pointing and clicking. (Hover over enemy, click them X number of times and watch them die) I love games like that. They are simple, to the point, and can bring hours of fun. Not to mention that you can play this game ONLINE with your friends or with anyone else who just happens to be on the game.True, there aren't too many weapons right now and it's also true that after you hit a million points it just sort of gets repetitive. But hey, what do you expect from something that costs less than a soda? This is one of those games that has many options for future developement. I really look forward to new weapons, new enemies, who knows what else might come. Also, one more perk about this game. It's a very small install size. It downloads fast and installs fast; and you don't need to worry about it soaking up your space like other games do."

You can pay for this with a few trading cards.~~Anyways, let me get into the actual review.~~The game is simple enough, and as you might expect, it is light on content. But the fact that it costs less than the average IOS or Android game makes it worth purchasing if you have some change just sitting in your steam account.As of this review the game has two modes. Endless night, which is literally just a test of will to see how long you can last without any defenses, and the normal game mode. In the latter, you have access to traps, weapons, and barricades you can purchase after each night ends. Similar to Call of Duty zombies, each wave gets increasingly harder, but also awards to player with health, ammo, and money drops. All are very important to survival, and without them you would be dead meat in minutes.And well, that['s pretty much it. If this game was more than a couple bucks, I would give it a bad review. But the fact that it was so cheap leads me to say that if you just want a quick game to play to satisfy your zombie needs, you should definitely pick it up.Finally, I just want to say that the developer has mentioned free updates in the future, and while I look foward to seeing them, it appears they come very slowly, as the last update was 2 months ago."

Check.This game is really fun. The achievements are difficult (but not impossible) to earn, and some of them you have to make a conscious effort to attain, which I definitely like. Played this originally at a LAN night with friends. The only downside in my opinion is that it only fits 4 people. If it was up to 6, it would be perfect, but then the first few nights would be way too easy. After 1 play, you can already start formulating strategies for barrier/turret layouts. This game doesn't take long to get good at, and it's got good graphics for what you're paying for it. I bought a 2-pack for $3 and gave one to a friend.All in all, this is a must own for anyone who likes defense games. One tip for when you buy it, try to wait for weapons to go on sale before purchasing them, and you will save a bunch of money in-game that way.I would recommend this game 11 times out of 10."

It's some thing like black ops but has cool upgrades and weapons and turrets.I like this game too bad items cost a lot so its heard to build a good defense but over time with the right walls best to use reinforced walls and upgraded turrets with only pistols they cost no ammo. but we only made it to level 16 and that was with three friends most of the time a forth came in later...

The turrets require you to purshase a gun and manually mount it to the turret, you then need to buy ammo for the gun which runs out really quickly, on round 10 it takes around $5000 of assualt rifle ammo to make a turret last the round.Did i mention the whole time your running around or trying to keep zombies off the barricaides they are breaking them and ignoring you? they target the most exspensive things first.You can glitch and go threw corners or barriciades, (and so can the zombies).When you throw a grenade you pause and cannot move for 3ish seconds and you have no control of where your guy throws the grenade.Every two days you get to pick a upgrade that helps you survive longer, extra health, regen, walk speed, etc.The public online mode of also horrid, unless your the host you cant build, buy, or pickup items. All you can do i shoot using the same starter pistol with infinite bullets that takes 2 clips to kill a zombie with.There are also a few powerups that drop that make you invisable for a short time or make you reload faster for a couple seconds.Also you get to choose from 'Guy' 'Girl' and 'SWAT' as playable characters.But for the price its a well made game and it will probably kill a few minutes of bordem or maybe a few hours if you get creative with a few friends."

Yet Another Zombie Defense isn't that bad. Really.The problem with the new reviews is that they care too much about things that doesnt affect in the gameplay itself -like ""bad graphics"" - I really hate when someone makes a review of a game, and put ""bad graphics"" as one of the cons. Graphics DOESN'T make good any game. Gameplay do. Fun do.Ok, we know that the game is repetitive, yes, it is. But, what you must consider is: The developers are working right now to put more weapons, zombies, and even a perk system. If this was the problem, you wont have it anymore. My guess is: They made the game, but didnt expected the game to sell well, and it did. Now, they see how much the game sold, and want to make it better, bigger. Remember, its a Indie game.Consider play with friends. Playing alone can make the game boring - unless you like the style (like me). Wait for further updates, the game is really cheap, and I absolutly not regret buying it."

,Not Recommended,270550,10622289,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,BlasterBox,"Way too repetitive.+Direct and easy game+Players share ammunition+Multiplayer makes it a thousands time more interesting-Waaaay too simple...-Too few weapons-Too few playable characters-Only the host can manage things (buying, selling and placing items)-Doesn't deserve to be paid-There are hackers-There are similar flash games for freePROS1. Direct and easy gameThe game itself is very easy and simple. You know your goal, which is to survive the zombie horde. Having such few and simple tasks makes you keep more focused. Moreover, the controls are extremely easy and it is almost impossible to get lost in the controls.2. Players share ammunitionA fact that adds a lot of realism to the game, playersalwaysshare their ammunition and money earned with each other, trying to survive the zombies. This is an excellent factor that consists that both players have to save ammunition as much as they can, in order to have better weapons sooner. Well, they're in a zombie horde together, they have to share the'wealth', don't they?3. Multiplayer > SoloMultiplayer is a thousand times better than single player. More funny and more challenging. Single player sucks, seriously. The zombies always come in your direction and in a straight line. With multiplayer tasks can be divided (one defends while other fetch ammunition, etc)CONS4. It's too simple!You just defend yourself from zombies. Nothing more. Okay, okay, I understand, this game IS defending yourself from zombies --but, there's literally nothing more! Nothing more! The terrain is flat, there's no boss, there's only one type of ammunition, there are only two or three types of zombies (slow ones and fast ones) and you can only kill a zombie if you shoot it in the head! What the f'ck, seriously~5. Few weaponsThere are just a fw weapons, ten or eleven, I estimate (along with one turret). Some have different aspects from each other but there are not enough weapons! This game's lacking mines, solid walls, homing missiles, katanas, daggers, bows and maybe some buffs? Bruning aura, speed aura, defenses, healing, luring... What about pets that deal a little damage? Or guns upgrades?6. Three playable charactersJust three: one guy, a girl and a SWAT member. They're all the same, the only difference between them is the appearance, nothing more. One could be a bit stronger than other, or faster, maybe more accurate? Or there could be level up system to increase defense for a small amount? But no.7. Only the host does things between waves!Let me explain. Zombies attack in waves. Between those waves the host can buy weapons or barriers, manage the ammunition or disassemble turrets. What about the other players? They just keep looking! Sometimes you want to help, building a nice blockade or buy a different ammunition and you can't, because this game system is bad! Being host means being the king8.This game doesn't deserves to be paidNot even a penny. The game itself is cheap (I bought it for ~R$1.50 -- ~US$0.70, I think) but I recognize I wasted my time, that this game shouldn't even be worth a penny. I bought the two-pack to play it with my cousin but now I realize this game was a waste of money and time (sorry developers!). The whole game looks like it was made in a hurry, to earn money and nothing more. It's so badly made that I played for half an hour and earned about 50% of the game achievements...9. HackersThe game community is dead. Along the dead community hackers usually join you room and eep trolling zombies and killing the rest of the fun and constantly you have to stop waht you're doing and ban them. I don't blame this game for the hackers, but they're annoying.10. There are similar games for free!There are similar flash and unity games likeYet Another Zombie Defensefor free! Some of them areBoxhead series. And even they're simple, they are as fun as YAZD and free of charge!"

Needless to say, I didn't expect much going in, as the title and price surely indicated.But a part of me, maybe niavely, at least expected some basic core elements of a shoot em' up waze-based zombie survival game, such as noise made by either the zombies, my character, or guns. Nope. The best you get is a single monotous thud sound when firing some of the weapons - which sounds less like an actual gunshot, and more like the sound of your heart sinking at the sight of this game.Another basic feature that is missing altogether: a point. Sure, it's called Yet Another Zombie Defense for a reason, and that's exactly what one should expect from it. But the utter lack of depth to the game - besides a handful of guns to buy and a few player upgrades (which are unlocked here and there, but don't provide much difference to the game) leaves you bored after only 5 or 10 minutes.Ultimately, if you buy this *flash game*, here's what you can expect: running in circles in an extremely limited, un detailed environment, shooting identical zombie after ifdentical zombie silently, while a repetative music track from some royalty-free music site plays endlessly. Oh, and keep an eye on your health, because there's no sound or visual indication that you are being hurt, other than the small red bar in the top corner of your screen disappearing with each hit, making you question if you're really playing a game from the 21st century or not.However, I understand the limited capabilities of independent developers, and for that I feel this review may be a bit harsh. But, then again, independent or not, if you want good reviews and happy players, make a decent game.Thankfully, I only payed about $1 for this game, and I do know that you get what you pay for. But, then again, I've played free flash games that are 5+ years old that are easily 100 times better than this garbage. Don't waste your time or money here."

It's a very simple hold your ground horde defense mode game. There's a fairly nice selection of weapons to pick from and 3 characters, but they don't really matter as they're visual only. The real ""meat"" to the game is the auto-turrets and walls. The auto-turrets allow you to place ANY gun you've bought on them and it then becomes that type of turret in effect making this a kind of tower defense game. You can even set up the little walls so zombies have to maze in through your towers to get to you.Will you play this much? Really depends on much much time you want to put into the walling and turret system. If that's not your thing, then this won't offer much for you. Do I recommend it? Again if you like those things it can be a good time killer while waiting on something else to download. So for that alone, yes I do recommend it."

It's one of those games that you play for about an hour, if you  have some friends to play with then maybe for a couple of hours and then get bored and forget about it. If this was a free to play game I would recommend it, but if you want to buy a co-op game where you have to shoot zombies just save up some money and buy something like Killingfloor 2. The problem I have with the game is that it doesnt excell in any cathegory. It looks awful, the gameplay is immensly repetitive, the music is nothing more than noise. On the other hand, if you like tower defense games, zombies, have some friends to play with and the game is on discount, it might be a good deal."

Charatchers, : The Swat, The Girl, and the Pizza Guy. So basically the only light is lit on a Street Post, in the Middle of no where powered by Redstone. I wish this was good like Orion Prelude. You can make a Wood Barricade, and Stone Barricade made by a Street Light. The guns come from God, The Zombies are low, The Rate of Fire is really not Straigt, The Bullets feel like your in the Matrix again. WHICH WAS IN LIKE 2201. Wow That was soo Past. *******************Tense****. This game has Guns wow. Wow its $10 which, you can play a better game on Miniclip made by a 12yr old. I can't believe this game is 10$ sale is like in 6 months. A baby can be borned. This game has only like 5 servers. The Objective of this game is to Survive just like COD:AW Zombies, get a Railgun become OP, Get Abuducted Cry Tears out like the Binding Of Issac, die then here comes the Binding Of Issac Rebirth. Still this game is the best Shooter, than COD2 how, Horrible does game where. Soooo babbbbbby.... This game is really named Yet Another Zombie Organism. Because the Zombies walked like they been a Virgin their whole life just like (Jessie). 10/10 would die by a Girl Zombie Again."

It's not worth full asking price, not by a long shot.There isn't much to the game and from a ""game design"" perspective it's pretty amateur.  However it worked with no bugs.I found the 'base building' to be tedious and unenjoyable to the point where I just erected a ton of wood walls as quickly as possible so I could quickly get to play the shooting part of the game.  I had no interest in exploring other options because it was a guessing game... there's no in-game information about why one base component would be better than another and I really didn't find myself caring enough to explore.The shooting part of the game is sub-par as well, but not super glitchy or annoying.  Aiming is a little wonky as your have to learn to aim above the zombies.But all in all if you like top-down shooters, buy it for an hour of something different.

I hopped in the game and matched up with 2 random players online.  Game was a bit fun for a few rounds.  Then I started to wonder why the graphics would lag when about 25-40 zombies would be dead in the same round.  My pc build could handle crysis 2 on ultra settings and almost any other very high end graphics game on high.  Anyways, i continued to play, and building forts didn't matter anymore because they would go down within the first 15 seconds of a round.  Every round resulted in everyone dieing in the first 20-25 seconds MAX except for myself.. I found myself just running in a circle around the map with a chainsaw and slowly killing the rest of the zombies.  The only challenge was to get the money before it disappeared (for the other players to spend) while having no upgrades on pickup reach/range.  So, basically, 1st game i played of zombie defense and already i was invincible with probably the cheapest weapon buy in game, the chainsaw.  Everyone thought i was hacking but obviously they were just too.. dumb to actually listen to me when i say ""just run around in a circle like i have been every round and you won't die.""  So in conclusion, the idea sounded VERY fun, i've always wanted to play a defense map where you could upgrade either weapons or your character stats and build turrets.  The game however, lags when more than 30 zombies are dead on your screen, weapons are very similar in damage and effect so there's not a lot of interesting/entertaining strategies you could use.  Although there are a nice range of weapons you could buy (but like I said they are all similar so it's not a big difference of buying them).  So, good idea, bad development.Oh and I told my friend that I gifted the 2nd part of the pack to not even waste his time.  This game was not only a waste of even the small amount of $2.99, but a waste of an hour of the very limited game time that I have."

The further you venture from the lamp, the darker it gets. So you are ecnouraged to stay near the lamp but not restricted from straying.It's your standard horde mode in that waves of enemies are sent against you that increase in quantity and difficulty as the game progresses. Killing enemies can net health, money, or ammo drops that disappear over time so you must be somewhat quick in picking them up.In between the waves you have the opporuntity to purchase various weapons and defenses which can give you a great advantage in the next wave. A nice feature is that these items will ocassionally go on sale making them significantly cheaper than their original price and stretching your money further. This can help in giving you that little edge up you need earlier than you would otherwise be able to afford it. Which can seriously help late game.As stated before, this game will not change your life and it isn't without it's faults. Mainly, it's limited. I would really like to see it grow and have new weapons and defenses added, maybe slightly expand the map over time.As is, this game is worth every bit of the few dollars I paid for it and I hope to see more.I'd give it a 3/5"

You try to survive wave after wave of zombies until you finally die.The weapons are typical for a zombie survival game (pistol, shotgun, flamethrower, SMG, Assault rifle, rocket launcher, etc). The map could use a little more detail. It's just a big floor of concrete with a lamppost in the center. (If you add some lines it could be a parking lot. Maybe they could even add some pot holes, and a few abandoned cars.)The game only has three playable characters guy, girl, and swat.The game could also use some more gore. (The zombies just fall over dead after shooting them. Exit wounds and blood splatter effects would make the zombies look sharp.)So far I haven't encountered any bugs.Yet Another Zombie Defense has the potential to be a very good game.

This is an experience like no other. Playing this game with friends, I truly discovered what it was like to love again. Running around the only light source in the game, desperately running from your pursuers while trying to pick up their leavings, is obviously an analogy for something deeper, something more akin to a spiritual release. As I lasered the lumbering forms of those I can only imagine I used to know, as Night after dreary Night came on, leaving little or no time to reflect on my actions leading up to this, the most drastic of situations, I knew that I had found the true meaning of futility. And when, invariably, I died, leaving my friend to be eaten by those brain-hungry beings that had dogged our footsteps, my only thought was that of retrying, doing better, surviving one more round.A true work of art."

Really looking forward to some of the proposed features of the game!The game really requires some skill, I think the furthest I've got is night 12, passing a night feels really rewarding! After that it gets crazy but from what I've read the developer is working on that.Multiplayer feature is fun but games are hard to connect to and sometimes just lag out. I'm guessing this is being worked on too.No real settings options. Not a big deal for most PC gamers however if your running intel 3000 or less graphics you may get some serious graphical lag even in low resolutions, would like to see visual quality adjustments. Would like to see support for more resolutions, Has trouble over 1080.Gameplay is straight forward and fun!

This game is JUST 1.99 EUR and IT'S BLODY EPIC! This is a strategic survival game in a zombie apocalypse. In this game, you need to build turrets, barricades and to buy wepons and see how mutch as long as you can you can survive!1) Wepons: In this game, the wepons are: pistol, machine gun, shotgun (which is my favourite), rifle, rochet laucher and some kind of a lighting. Oh, and you can have laser as an attachment. (I dunno if I spell it right :P)2) Zombies: Lot's of zombies! AND MORE!! AND MORE!!!........But....they try to kill you (logic) and you need to kill them to earn money, health and ammo.3) Gameplay: This game has Singleplayer and Co-op. Co-op can be played with friends and online, with a player. The game doesn't have much thing and zombies, characters etc., But It Is A Lot Of Fun!!!So, the conclusions are: Such Fun, Much Zombies, WOW!....Ha ha ha!

The name gives most of it away.  Decided to buy it with a 75% off coupon, and it was a good game for the price, and to pass a little bit of time.What I like is the co-op option in this little, simple game. Though I have not played it yet, and I know there are much better games out there for it, I can still see me and a few friends having fun on here for a little.Then there is always the plus for some people; that is, it just being a little game that you can turn on and do a little bit of killing zombies.  Of course not all people, but I know some people who would like this just for the fact that you get to kill zombies in it and test how long you can survive against the endless hordes."

Nobody plays Endless mode Online so you will have to Solo it but anyways.. this game is one of the best zombie games i've ever played like.. the things i like about it are it actually takes skill to survive and no pay2win stuff although it is a very basic game.. looks like it took about a week to code but still its worth the buy :) I love this game sometimes i get bored of other games and i start this up and i remember how much fun it is."

,Not Recommended,270550,16708120,"Posted: 25 June, 2015",all,pokusan,"Kind of hard to say here, but I ultimately can't recommend it. I got it on sale for $0.75, which I think would be the only time to buy this game. I finished all the achievements in 3 hours and it isn't hard to get any of them. I'll say what's good and not so good about the game quickly.Good:- Online multiplayer + leaderboards: You can actually join any game that is being played up to 4 people and you can choose to let people join your game or to just allow friends, or not allow anyone. It's easier to rack up the achievements with people and get onto the leaderboards.- Quick perfect game & avg. game completion %: There is only 1 achievement that requires a bit of tact and strategy, but as soon as I tried it, I got it pretty easily.- Endless mode: For those of you that are into survival.- Easy to pick up and put down: You get into the game quickly, so you can do it to pass some time and try to see how far you can get.Not so good:- Too easy: There really isn't much difficulty to this at all. A little thought as to how to manipulate the mobs takes you a pretty long way.- Not much to the game: it's a pretty simple game, but I wouldn't call it ""fun."" It's just kind of a mindless game.- Music: Same music all the way through, so it gets stale real fast.Simply put, the game just isn't MUCH fun because it doesn't seem rewarding or frantic. I think they really missed out on the feel of the game, because while zombies are pretty mindless, normally there seems to be some sort of danger. The music misses out on this danger or frantic touch too, so overall, I can't recommend the game. However, if you're looking to raise your perfect games and avg. completion %, this is an easy one to help you with that."

You buy ammo and barricades at night, but be warned though flimsy little barricades aren't the most reliable things. You can get multiple different weapons and things to help you. Grenades, chainsaw, mines, smg, assualt rifle, shotgun, rocket launcher, sniper, and a flamethrower. Make sure you work with your team and worry about your health regen too or else you aren't going to last long at all.All in all I'd say this game is worth the $2 you pay for it.

Why you have to rely on the host to get anything that isn't a pistol, I've no idea. I had a host who bought barricades, thats all - ofcourse he had to buy himself a shotgun and assault rifle after that but 3 players sharing a shotgun with hardly any ammo is not very fun. Getting hit doen't seem to work well either, the range is a little further than it should - running past a zombie that hurts me despite the sizable gap beween it and I is annoying. Almost as annoying as the time and fixed position of a grenade throw, sure you have to position it and it goes where it should but the time it takes can get you killed at the later stage if you have ben hit - an almost defenite if theres multiple that get to you.I also found a fun little bug, what I pressed that caused my entire hud to disappear? Not sure it was tab, capslock, shift or control and since there wasn't any options when I pressed escape, I couldn't quit to fix it or check if theres a control to do so - there isn't.

This, for the little amount of money to get this game, is a good deal.  Its cheap, it's cheerful, will definately kill a couple hours and if you bring in a friend, then you got some fun to be had.Ok its far from perfect, hell I did encounter a bit of a bug/glitch that i had to restart the game and on controller ( which I used ) the aiming is a bit hard, but for the price, you can forgive it.Basically the game is a Tower Defence x Twin Stick Shooter x Survival.  Build your own little fort and defend it as best you can.  Simple right?  well yeah, but its not AS simple as it sounds cus of course things get harder and harder as the levels go on.  You got a decent varierty of weapons and defences at your disposal, ranging from simple wooden fences to electric fencing, pistols to RPGs and a bit more.  A rather neat lil tool is the Auto Turret in which you must mount a weapon you have on your person as the gun.  So you can have an Auto tracking shotgun turret, or flamethrower turret defending your base with you.Granted the game looks bland with the grey floor and single solitary lamp post and yes, I think the game would benefit highly from additional environments and more objects in the environment, so hopefully that can be a thing in this games future.All in all, my advice is if you see this on sale, get it.  I got it for 39p....39p!!!  I can buy chocolate bars more expensive then that and enjoy them less then this game.  Really, what you gotta lose when you spend that little?  100mb of space on your hard drive, thats it.  Grab the game, grab friends, kill zombies. Worth it."

Sentries are a bit too OP(and by OP I mean NECESSARY TO SURVIVE past level 9), just slap them in a box and kill everything!It's medium to complete(as in earn all achievements, completing a survival game doesn't really work otherwise), and fairly short at that.The atmosphere is a bit too dark(the map literally has one lamppost in the middle of it which is all your light), and of course the map background has literally no decorations whatsoever.Slightly luck-based, in Survival the weapons you get are by random chance and you can hold only one at a time, and when you're kiting zombies in circles they can spawn right where you're running to(AKA the only place without zombies)Recommended at full price!"

They do nothing other than change what you look like.A normal guy, normal girl, or a swat officer.  You can only access defense mode at first till you get past level 10. You can then play Endless Mode. In defense mode you fight off waves of zombies making money for each kill and they drop random amounts from 250$-750$ as well. You can place turrents and walls to help you as you progress. The turrents you have you buy a gun and place it on the turrent for it to work. In Endless mode you just fight off an endless wave of zombies trying to stay alive as long as you can simple and yet very fun.I had overall a wonderful time playing although not many people were playing only 5 games were ever found at once for me to join and never a endless mode game.

Heck, my second go, I jumped in a random game with three other players and it operated well: No Lag and No drop in FPS that I could tell. I will go on to say that the game is CURRENTLY at a state where more could be added, but what lies there is an enjoyable framework of a zombie defense game that can continue to grow with support.

It's bigger than some $60 games out there, there is a good variety of guns.Graphics are so/so but the fact that there's one lightpost and then a bunch of open land, there could at least be a little more scenery in my opinion.Trading cards are easy, just the way I like it.No voices in the characters, no running but the zombies increase in difficulty which is a good challenge.Two game modes are actually enough for this game, it keeps you satisfied.Online play works fantastic, probably the game's best feature. Online play makes the game easier and more enjoyable with randoms and friends.For $1.99 and was on sale for 49 cents at one point, It's something you should consider buying.Items like barriers and turrets don't help as much as you would hope, but creating a base around the lightpost (hint, hint) and trapping yourself inside with a turret on each side is a EXTREMELY good idea surprisingly.Achievements, fun to try to accomplish. I have yet to get more but they do increase in difficult, so I like them.I bought this game for my friend and he doesn't play it that much on his own time without friends (me)  so I don't know if he enjoys the single player as much the multiplayer when playing. I do however.I do recommend this game, for $1.99, it's a steal, a good couple hours to get into. A few flaws, but many advantages. No campaign which kinda stinks, but endless night, never stops. No character voices, but tons of screaming zombies. Guns are generic, but there's a lot of them. Barriers and Turrets can be useless at points, until you find the right way to use them.
