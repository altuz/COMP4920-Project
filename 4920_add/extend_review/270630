There is always something new to discover. The art style is full of love and character.CONS:The game itself is pretty short. Achievements are finicky, some are simply not working, or have to be jarred by messing with the menu options. AI can act a little wonky, especially if you've been messing with them for a long time, (as you would when trying to get certain achievements.)

,Recommended,270630,20893450,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,[J7] Dsp21 👻,"A very casual and really unknown game this is. I stumbled upon it on the Halloween Sale and it looked like it could be fun. There's little to no story, and that's good when looking at a simple game like this. In Haunt the House: Terrortown you play as ghosts who possess objects in order to scare people. Your objective is to empty the buildings, by making people leave, or actually making them jump out the windows. You have a meter which indicates the atmosphere of the situation and it goes up by scaring people. While it is going up, you unlock more actions (up to 3) in each object to cause a bigger scare and actually make everyone run for their lives!See? Simple as that, but the overall look of the game makes it so appealing for me because of how contradicting it is. Contradicting because you have this really cute ghost, who basically wants to scare everyone away :DThe game lasts a mere 5 hours, maybe 7-8 for completionists, but rather than that it's a bit short. It seems that new levels are added once in a while though, and that's great. For 5 euro, it's definitely worth a buy if you're in doubt to get it, the casual and cute-looking ""horror"" game definitely deserves a bit more fame, hence my spooky review! 7/10"

And then as you do that you turn more people into ghosts and can play as the different ghosts, and as the area gets more scared the objects you posess do spookier things.I really liked it and hope they add more to it, because it's super cute and spooky.The only con is that it doesn't have a whole lot of game play took me a little over an hour to beat it the first time."
,Recommended,270630,25872902,"Posted: 5 October, 2016",all,Audish,"Ever since the classic Ghost Master gave players the power to scare idiot homeowners out of their dwellings, I've been eager to see more games about being the haunter rather than the hauntee. Poltergeist: A Pixellated Horror was another fine offering, if a little simple. Now we have Haunt the House, possibly the most polished of the haunting simulators yet, but still not as deep as you might be hoping.You take on the role of the cutest ghost in the entire world (seriously look at him) as he works to scare away every mortal in sight. You're going to need more than his adorably pitiful ooOOoo though, which is why you can possess just about every object in the game. Once you have taken over a chair or lamp or dresser or whatever, you get some new options to terrify those in the vicinity. Most objects can move or make some little sound, but once you raise the overall terror level in the building (shown in a big, helpful bar at the bottom) you can unlock new moves with certain objects like projecting apparitions and breaking things.Starting out, the gameplay appears dead simple. You find the largest gathering of people, possess something, mash your spook button until everyone flees, then repeat. After a some time with your ghostly bud you'll come to discover there's a little more nuance to it than that. People recover their composure after escaping a spook, so chasing down specific victims and chain-haunting them is far more effective for getting them out of the house. You can also corral terrified residents to windows which they will gladly leap from to save you the wait for them to reach the door. Not all spooks are equal, either, as the ones that can be unleashed rapid-fire can send people into a tizzy before they can escape.The base scenario, Terror Town, features an open map with four locations to haunt. There's also the mansion from the original Flash game, a holiday map, and a train with three cars. Most areas have 20 to 30 people to run off, along with some secrets to find like fatalities you can cause and objects with special spooks. That should be enough to keep you busy for an hour, but beyond that... I can't really say. You're scored on the efficiency of your haunting and there are achievements to turn up, though if neither of those interest you then this is going to be a short game.I will say that I can't get enough of the bold, cartoony look Haunt the House revels in. Possessed objects do all sorts of ridiculous and adorable things, from tables dancing to portholes becoming eldritch portals. Your victims are all wide-eyed caricatures with giant expressions and silly screams. The sound design sells a lot of it, in fact, with equally adorable honks and swishes for the spooks and an old-tymey cinema soundtrack. It looks great, sounds great, and plays great (especially with a controller), it'll just be over before you know it. But if you like terrifying virtual people as much as I do, it's a good time while it lasts.Did you enjoy this review?

Grab the game while you still can before the ghost grab you soulsI still remember myself back then playing this game on a website (i can't remember what the website name is but... it was flash game website), i've put many hours on this game, tried different method, tried to ""kill"" every person, etc.... to be honest, if my friend didn't play this game (I saw his pop-up playing this) maybe i never knew this version of Haunt the House exist.Sorry for my english, it's not my first language."

YOu play a ghost, and your ghoul is to float to a number of location and scare the bajeezus out of all the people that are visiting there. You do so by inhabiting all the objects that rest there. You start out being able to do really simple things to the objects like moving and jiggling them. Eventually once this scares people, you can do really BIG things with them. This causes terror level to go up and people to start jumping out of windows! (HURRAH!) The addicting part of this game is that it's really fun to see every bit of this game. The art cartoonstyle is awesome and perfect and you really want to see every level that each object can do. There are a ton of ingame and steam achievements to do. They've even added content along the way. It's definitely better than most casual games. It actually has goals, endgame, and best of all: a point! Which kind of makes it a real game. Just a very original one. Only negative is that after playing awhile it gets a little tedious trying to scare away those last few people. Although it is funny seeing them still casually chatting in a room as if they are emo and bored when they've seen all the haunted house stuff you've been doing to them. The price is not bad at all for the amount of content. Whenever it is onsale even BETTER!"

When it went on sale, I picked it up. It's definitely a throwback to the original and features the same game dynamics. The ""levels"" include a train, a town, the north pole, and the first Haunt the House, which I was excited to see! This game is just as much fun as I remembered, and I still have a lot more to play. The only note I have is that after playing the Terrortown level for a large chunk of time, my screen froze and after waiting for a while, I finally had to force close, unable to complete my level with only six people left to scare. This was a bummer, and put me off a bit, but as long as it is not a reoccuring issue, I'm sure I'll enjoy many more hours haunting! I definitely recommend for anyone who enjoyed the original, but also for anyone who wants a fun, easygoing game!EDIT: Although my game did freeze, forcing me to shut it down, when I later started it back up, the game showed my previous progress and asked if I would like to resume. This was great, as I wouldn't have to restart the lengthy Terrortown level. Because of this, I again give it a thumbs up!EDIT: I played the original level for the first time and some of the people were frozen in their running pose and not moving from where they were. This was remedied by scaring them, but made me have to spend time specifically with them, scaring them enough to unfreeze and run away. This weird freeze-pose has only happened to me so far on the original level, although I have only played it once, so it may not be a recurring issue; I don't know.After these edits, I still wholeheartedly recommend Haunt the House: Terrortown!!!"

If none of what i suggested is your gaming choice, avoid this game. I found this game is actually more stable and playable than others on steam, and was quite fun. This is why i am giving it a thumbs up, for being good clean fun and all around stable as a game.UPDATED: With the new levels added, it is much longer than it was, but it still seems too short all in all..still, a great game to play with your children, especially around haloween or late in the nighttime.."

It's a fun, if short game. You float around as a ghost and posess diffrent items to scare people, and depending on how spooky the house is at the moment, you can do diffrent things. Some of the spooky actions you can do are actually a little creepy (like the spector strapped to a gurny) while others are silly (like making the dino moonwalk). It's a really fun game.But it is VERY short.I wish it was at least a little longer (it's only 4 levels plus one DLC Christmas themed level), or that, at least, the various ghosts saved between playthroughs so I didn't have to unlock my faves each time. However, it being so short does make it something I can play for a half hour to a hour and be done with it, without worrying about being pulled into a long thing. I'll play it for a little bit while waiting for, say, stuff to be done cooking becasue it's pretty fun way to kill some time.I'm not sure if I can fully reccomend the game for full price, but I got it on sale for half price and feel that was a fair price for it."

Afterwards, you can play as their ghosts and listen to their various undead calls (for example, the chef has an evil French laugh).However, I do have a problem with the game. It's a small one, but it seems that the AI of the people intruding your home becomes worse when there's less of them. For example, on one of the levels I cleared out a majority of the people, with only two left. These two people took 15 minutes to get rid of, despite the fact that they screamed for most of the time.But like I said, it's a small problem that I might be subconciously exaggerating and is definitely worth the price."

No need to wait, Haunt the House: Terrortown may satisy your need.Haunt the House: Terrortown has you play a ghost throughout all of it's levels to drive the people out of the building. There are different ghosts in each level, several in the level Terrortown due to the scale, which are designed accordingly to the level. This also goes for the items within each area, if it's a museum theme, there will be objects to fit into it. An added plus is the personalized scares between each type of item. Not including duplicate items that appear across all levels, each new item has it's own spook. Depending on the item, it can also have between 1-3 available spooks that will have to be unlocked by the atmosphere meter, which fills the more you spook people, and along with this, people will run out. The AI, however, can be frusturating as it dashes to go in the opposite direction of the exit consistently. They will eventually go to the exit as you scare them constantly, but this can be annoying especially if it is the last person on the map.Haunt the House: Terrortown will crash when first playing it. This does force you to close the game in the middle of playing a level. Fortunately, Haunt the House has a saving system that saves quite often. You can continue the level from where you left off, with only the objects returning to their original places and the people walking around contently.The soundtrack has the same theme throughout each levels without annoying the player. With how much the player does, and the individual sounds each spook has, it is easily forgotten. While the artwork is one of the selling points, which is why I bought it, as the cute art style shines.The replay value depends on the player. If you are an achievement hunter, there are achievements that are rather difficult to complete.Overall+ Cute art and animations+ The unique spooks with every type of item+ Effective, simple controls- Short- The AI can be frusturating- Crashing is common when first playingHaunt the House: Terrortown is short, but it does bring enjoyment in those empty afternoons.

The charmingly simple idea behind HtH, taking territory by scaring everyone in the area away or into killing themselves, is undermined by 2 issues:1. The response time of your character and your inability to effectively interrupt animations results in great difficulty in chasing characters around the level and encourages you to sit in 1 object and spam the same animations over and over.2. Characters don't respond reliably. Chasing a single or a few characters who won't leave with no clear information on what you could possibly do to make them leave is immensely frustrating.If the game was actually easier I would've had more fun exploring the animations, and if there was greater depth this might have been a better game over all. However, as it stands HtH is just a waste of time."

Gameplay is somewhat chaotic, there's really no information about how to scare people effectively, and it is just repetitive. Achievements here are also a weak point - they are almost exactly the same for each level, demanding just to interact with every single item possible in every available way.I am really sad to post a negative review here. Especially that few years ago I have played flash version of this game - which included only Mansion level - and rated it 5 out of 5 on Kongregate.

You win when the last person has fled the location.To scare the guests into fleeing the place, you can possess various objects dotted around each location and using them when a person comes within its range. Using possessed objects near people causes a meter to fill, which in turn grants more ways to spook people per possessed object.Why I do not recommend this gameThe art style is nice and there are a lot of possessable objects the player can use. I like how some of the haunts are references, like a book getting pierced by a fang (Harry Potter) or an object damaging an enemy RPG style, including the HP in damage it did.However, the game unfortunately turns into a bore to play. At a certain moment you've seen all the haunts each possessed object can do, but the people have not all cleared out yet. So you need to chase them out, usuallyone by one. When they get scared however, they might actually run towards the haunted object instead of fleeing from it, so trying to steer them to the exit will prove to be hit or miss. Thus trying to chase them one by one from the location with objects you've already used alot turns the game in a chore, however charming the atmosphere.Moreover, every level works in this same manner: possess objects and scare the guests away. There are no new mechanics being introduced during the gameplay and the only increase in difficulty comes from increasing the number of people your ghost is to scare away.Last but not least, people rather often got stuck on objects and only started moving again after a good scare. This is a small bug though.In conclusion I can't recommend this game, despite its charm."

It's not that it isn't cute or enjoyable, but there's not enough content to justify the price tag, even at $4.99. There's supposed replay value, but why would you go through the trouble of choosing the other ghosts when there's literally no difference between them? They don't have any different powers, so you're better off just sticking with the default ghost and playing through it once.To me, there wasn't enough innovation here. The ""hundreds of objects with different powers"" get old fast, and not all objects are worth possessing. For instance, the little bottles only spray into the air and don't really scare anybody at all, so if a good portion of your objects don't do much, why would we bother seeking them out? Why not just go for the big ticket items? I could understand if they had interesting animations, but the little objects I'm talking about flat-out don't. I didn't see the big fuss there, and by the end of your first playthrough, it's likely you've possessed them all anyway.This game might be good for kids who like repetition and don't mind replaying the exact same thing over and over again, but it could have been great for both kids and adults, and that's what bothers me most.

There are different ghosts you can unlock but they don't do anything different apart from slightly changing the sound you make when pressing S.The controls are kind of unfinished too, mostly I expected controller or mouse support but there wasn't any. It's all done with the keyboard and in a kind of awkward way (you use S to confirm in the menus instead of Enter or space, and D to come back instead of escape).If you want some bit of fun I recommend it but only if it doesn't bother you to put 5€ in it.

,Recommended,270630,10738008,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,arbitrarycivilian,"This is an absolute gem of a gem, and I'm so glad I discovered it. It is simple yet satisfying, and just the right length.You take on the role of a ghost, whose only goal is to go about the town scaring its poor denizens. After getting sufficiently spooked, they will abandon whatever place you're currently haunting, and your goal is to get everyone to flee all the buildings.As a ghost, you can float around freely, and the movement is rather quick and elegant. It really is a joy to just fly around the environments as an adorable little poltergesit. To actually scare people, you haunt objects and then perform one of a number of different preset actions, which is just a cute animation that scares any citizens that observe it. For example, you might cause a rocking horse to start rocking back and forth on its own, a phone to start ringing, or a skeleton dinosaur to snap its jaw. There are also some that actually involve some ghost/entity appearing and doing something that would be genuinely creepy if this game weren't so darn cute. You unlock more interactions as the citizens get progressively more terrified. Nothing in this game is actually scary, of course. The art style is playful and cartoonish, and all the animations are adorable (and very smooth).Besides scaring the pants off everyone you can find, there are also some special inhabitants (a clown, a cook, a boat captain) who you are able to kill by solving very simple ""puzzles"" (really just special interactions with the environments). Once they are dead, their ghosts become available for you to use, although this doesn't change the gameplay. Still it's a nice addition. Who hasn't wanted to be a ghost clown? If only there was a pirate ghost available...There are only four locations in the game - a hospital, a boat, a museum, and a theater. They are each unique from each other and all have some great animations to behold, but I found the museum and theater espeically fun (in the museum you can move around as a statue and attack people, and in the theater you can play instruments). Even if you want to see every animation the game has to offer, it can still be beaten in about an hour. You cannot die (you are already a ghost!) or lose in any way. Overall, the game is more like a toy than an actual game, but that's fine. It's a delightful toy, that please 21-year-old me just as much as it would have please 10-year-old me."

This'll give you a good idea of what you're in for; however, like others stated, the game takes MAYBE an hour to beat, and there aren't really any extras besides trading cards and achievements. I bought the game only because I absolutely love everything about this little game: the art design, scare tactics, animations, and especially the ghost.Basically, what you do is you possess things around the place you're trying to scare people out of. The terror meter raises every time you do something, and as people leave the house, you'll sort of have to chase people down and scare them personally. The AI can be a little stupid, so sometimes it requires a little patience. In addition, there are people who don't react to your scare tactics- you're supposed to kill them! They each have special ways to be killed.I personally liked the original game much more. The ways to scare people were better, but there were a few that captured my heart. So, I'll restate- it's probably not worth the money, but it's definitely fun."

I feel the addition of this content makes it worth buying it now.They also added a free soundtrack for people whom already owned the game.In these days were DLC is king and supporting a game long past its launch date is an uncommon thing we should reward/support developers like these.The game itself is fun and there is a good amount of humor to be found in it. They nailed the atmosphere with the art and music direction. It gives the feel of a haunted house you'd visit at the fair.The controls could still use an option to remap keys since the current keyboard layout felt awkward to me... but there is indeed a good compromise available: using a controller like someone recommended in the comments.

You're a ghost trying to scare off the living. You manipulate things in the environment to freak people out until they run away screaming. Many of the classic basic horror movie props are involved (mysteriously swinging light fixtures!) but there are also surprises and enjoyably unexpected results.The graphics are cute and creepy in a way that's distinctly different from nearly every other cute and creepy game. The stylized design reminds me of antique marionettes from old childrens' books - cute enough to make the horrible aspects less disturbing, but weird enough to remind you that you're not playing a goofy kids' cartoon. I enjoyed making little kids scream and cry WAY too much.Unfortunately, the idea is so good that you can't help wishing they'd taken it farther. I'm reminded of Jaws - another genius ""why aren't there more games like this?"" idea that ended up as a good but not great game. I'm also thinking of Spelunky, and how all the different elements sometimes come together to produce hilarious/catastrophic occurences. If Haunt the House had more potental for those kinds of ""perfect storm"" random interactions, you could play it forever and see something different each time.So it takes a short time to see and do all of HtH. Even with the additional levels, I pretty much finished everything but the completist acheivements in a couple of casual hours. On one hand, there's nothing wrong with that - it's a great casual game that isn't loaded down with unecessary filler. I'd much rather have devs do a small game perfectly than try and fail to make it bigger than it needs to be. On the other hand, I was left wanting more... that awesome idea just begs for more.So I liked Haunt the House, it's one of those great little games that I know I'll pick up and play every once in a while. But a bigger Haunt the House - with more complex and unpredictable environmental interactions - could easily be one of my favorite games ever. Will anyone make this happen?"

Controls on the Steam PC version are slightly different, but not terribly so.The Steam version is essentially a collection of minigames, with not a terrrible amount of variation, but enough that each is distinct. The goal is always the same: creep people out enough that they leave your residence.The MansionThe browser game is, essentially, the Mansion. It plays pretty much the same, and you play the cute little inverted teardrop ""Oooooh"" ghost. This one I occasionally will just let float off somewhere and press the possession button a few times just to hear it's cute little ghost noises. The moans don't seem to really affect people so much as actually possessing things and creeping folk out. Some things don't seem as effective at scaring in the Steam version, such as the hand-plates. In the browser version, claws breaking through wall-mounted plates would be enough to send people to jumping out the windows, but here it often is only mildly frightening, and is less likely to induce panic.The Holidays/North PoleThe little ghost that inhabits this area has the sniffles, and will sneeze when possession button is pressed apart from objects. This area has fewer strict rooms, and has a general holiday vibe (if you hadn't guessed). It isn't that much different from the mansion in terms of environment, but it still definitely has some interesting things going on.TerrortownIn Terrortown iteself, you return to the ""Ooooh"" ghost...sort of. You start out in the bell tower and float around scaring people out of a total of four locations: a hospital, a museum, a cruise ship, and a theatre. You will find a total of nine people whom you cannot scare. These people you kill off, in essence, and once they are dead they will haunt the bells, and you can play as them instead of ""Ooooh"", though I am reasonably certain everything does the exact same things, so it's really more like if you want to be a nurse ghost, now's your chance.Ghost trainDespite the fact that this level features a CARNIVAL on a TRAIN, this is, I believe, the only level where you cannot cause someone to commit suicide. At least, no one did when I played it. The dynamics here are unique: there are three cars, featuring a haunted house, a carousel, and a fun house. Each car has a different atmosphere, but people can walk through all the cars. The goal is to get everyone off the fun house car at the back of the train, This is a bit different than previous levels, because in, say, Terrortown, people did not come back into a vacated house; they just left, and stayed out. Here, though, you could have someone get chased out of the haunted house, go all the way to the fun house, and wander back, screaming the whole way.Oh yes, and that ghost is a steam-shaped poultergeist, dubbed, the ""Nyaaaah"" ghost.In conclusion, if you want a basic idea of what this game is like before you buy it, play the browser version first; it's a nice little preview, and should give you a pretty good idea whether you'll like this or not."

It's just a simple cutesy game for people who like cute spooks. Seeing how the scares evolve with time can be entertaining, The music and art style can certainly be appealing. It was worth it for me personally to have this short game to toy with around Halloween, but I sort of wish they would make downloadable content with more levels!"
,Not Recommended,270630,32696687,Posted: 23 June,all,Milkman: Beyond,"As a big fan of this game's Flash counterpart, Haunt the House, I was excited to experience this game, even with the understanding that it would not be much different than its predecessor. I'm sorry to say that even with this in mind, I did not find the game very worth it.Pros: The graphics have improved slightly. While I personally prefer the more cartoony, flat look of the original, the HD revamp is nothing too jarring and is welcome. The game runs faster (most of the time - see below), and scares are as satisfying as ever (when they work - again, see below). The expanse of levels and new content is entertaining, as is the inclusion of characters that you can intentionally kill to unlock as ghosts.Neutral: The controls are tighter. In almost all cases, this should fit in under one of the Pros for a game, but the lack of floatiness sort of detracts from the atmosphere, though this is mostly nit-picky. With the larger levels, it is necessary to be more mobile, and the ghost has been given a speed boost to compensate for this. However, with trying to precisely possess a specific object where multiple are clumped together, this sometimes becomes more of an inhibitor than something that is beneficial.Cons: The game freezes and crashes at random, typically during the redesigned Flash-version level. AI has taken a few too many hits to the head, and sometimes your victims will stare directly at a top-tier scare with no effect, stand still or run in place, or go from being perfectly calm to jumping out of the nearest window for no reason at all. This is a significant downgrade from the original game which, while suffering from this issue, did so at a much lesser degree. Scaring all of the people from the house/train/mansion/etc. becomes more of a game of luck rather than one of tactically using your environment to your advantage. Most importantly, the game is far too short - I've completed much of it in an hour, and it seems that the only thing prolonging it are the built-in achievements, some of which are rather random (possess one particular object and use one particular scare) and others which are obvious (hit a Terrifying atmosphere).Thanks to a sale, I managed to purchase this game for 99 cents. If you are a die-hard fan of the original Flash game, you can certainly pull some enjoyment from this title, but I would very much advise against doing so at full price. Be prepared for a game that may provide only a few hours of entertainment with many moments of frustration inbetween."

,Recommended,270630,31186751,Posted: 16 April,all,Mercury,"If you've played (and enjoyed) the original flash game from 2010, you'll want to purchase this one! The classic mansion house level is present, along with a ""North Pole Department Store"" level and a ""Ghost Train"" level. And of course, there is the main level within the game called ""Terrortown"" which actually consists of four smaller areas. It'll take maybe about 3 hours tops to complete each level, and a likely 5 hours to 100% the game (all S rank, all achievements). Achievement hunters, you'll love this game! Now there is one achievement that is a bit bugged (Next of Kin) but just prioritize getting all of the ghosts in the Terrortown level in a run, do a few cycles, and you should be good."

76561198321593650,Recommended,270630,31052880,Posted: 9 April,all,dolanspin,"I certainly liked the original Haunt the House, so finding a way to throw money at it made me feel good. Also, with 4 full areas (But can you really call Terrortown just 1 full area?) it's worth putting money into. The game retains its charm and humor from its flash days, and has even more polish than before. Really, it's exactly what you'd expect: A vastly expanded and polished version of the original Haunt the House, already one of the best, most addicting, and polished flash games I've ever played.However, I do have a couple of complaints with this game. First of all, the controls. This game controls very similarly to the original, but there's one small change: You can't perform spooks with the arrow keys, which are performed with the WASD keys. (Also, I just realized--this game has individual names for every spook action, another almost unnessecary layer of polish.) If the game's going to use the arrow keys and the WASD keys, there should be an option to switch between arrow keys only and WASD keys only. Also, the people you're supposed to scare get scared way too easily, and in combination with them moving a bit slower(?) it makes it fairly easy to overdo it.Though, those complaints all come from playing the original game for like 5 years. It's still a very good game, and even if you can't buy it or feel it's not worth the money, you still have no excuse not to play the original Haunt the House on places like Kizi and Armor Games."

Some of the spooks are actually a little eerie, others are brash and hilarious.My main issue with the game comes from its mechanics - basically you have to scare people out of the house. It's easy enough, fun even, until you drop down to the last handful of people - then it becomes tedious. People react in different ways, which makes it interesting when the level is full of people, but when it boils down to just you and this one obstinate prat who just won't leave no matter how many things you levitate in his face it kinda loses its charm.Overall I still enjoy playing, but only when I have time to kill."

Scaring the people out of the building is challenging, but it feels random rather than like something skill can beat.  You could probably go achievement hunting if you wanted.Make sure to start with the terrortown map, that's the only one with a full-fledged tutorial.The developer's detective P&C game is better."

Luckily you do not have to even experience cruel fate of Patrick Swayze either, just try playing Haunt the House: Terrortown.A product, which originates from flash game project made by SFB Games, may not give us chills and make our hearts shiver in terror, but that does not mean it cannot offer us a decent level of entertainment. HtH :T is an action game, where you play as an (un?)friendly ghost. When you take the first glance of the game, you will notice its humble and simple 2D graphic, which resembles the style of Detective Grimoire.  With that approach game does not try to be scary, but instead is presented with pleasant and frivolous outlook. Soundtracks only contributes more to the not-so-horrific atmosphere of the game, and it certnaly has a charm.Your main goal is, what a shocker… to scare people in town. The place, where our ghastly adventure begins is separated into 4 areas : hospital, museum, theatre and ship. Because our ghost is possibly too cute to actually scare anyone, he has to posses objects and animate them in front of unwelcomed  meddlesome citizens. Whole mechanic is very simple – you use arrow keys to float with our dainty blob of ectoplasm and with w,s,a,d keys you perform certain actions on objects installed in every area. Each scare builds our energy, which allows us to perform even more terrifying frights. Ghost Master anyone? You have to be careful though, being too scary may badly influence our rating, because our victims may decide to simply end their lifes. Whole gameplay is very simple and you just cannot dislike ghost characters and their silly moans, design of levels and general humour HtH:T has.However the game contains a serious flaw: main problem is the lack of an actual content. Whole adventure may actually be finished in around an hour and two additional levels do not mend this issue completely. The another problem is the AI of our unfortunate victims. They sometimes can run back and forth without sense if we terrorize them too much, which may prevent us from getting a good grade for our haunting.This leads to the conclusion, that product may fit better as an mobile app, that you play while riding a bus or during lecture, than actual Steam game. I can recommend it, but please be aware of its limited possibilities.Haunt the House: Terrortown - game cuter and friendlier than CasperPros:-	 Graphic and music-	 Casual flow of the gameCons:-	 Lack of sustainable amount of content does not ensure much of a replayability-        Problematic AI of NPCsVerdict5/10"
