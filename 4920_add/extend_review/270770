,Recommended,270770,20522050,"Posted: 14 January, 2016",all,Faudraline,"Etherlordsis a strategy defense combined with a neat and challenging card game combat hailing from Nival Interactive, a small Russian development team that will take on the formidable feat of developingHeroes of Might and Magic V, eventually later on. As a side note, alongside its quite improved sequelEtherlords II, the game holds a special place for me; meaning many frustrating hours of deck building and combat practice during 2001-2004. I was about to shed tears of joy when I first managed to beat this one!In the world of Ether, there comes a time when the way to the Temple of Time is finally open. The old legend states that whoever holds dominion over the Temple shall rule the power of Ether, the substance of all magic and creation. Four distinct nations of the realm: druidic Vitals, aloof Kinets, fierce Chaots and decaying Synthets all begin a race towards the Temple to challenge the master of the world: the White Lord. Only one shall succeed and overcome the challenges of becoming the next White Lord. As the saying goes: ""The Ether enslaves the ones who obey it, and destroys the ones who do not"".I suspect that neither European nor American market are familiar with this challenging and enjoyable series, so I'll try to make a resume for the game dynamics. In its essence,Etherlordsis a strategy game which presents the player an isometric map with a capital city, resources to gather and monsters to challenge. With each combat your hero overcomes, he/she levels up to unlock a selection of abilities. You have to make sure that you protect your base and gather needed resources to wage war at the same time. Here, we basically have aHeroes of Might and Magicalternative.The combat itself on the other hand, is a variation ofMagic the Gatheringcard game where your hero and the enemy faces each other, with monsters to summon and spells to alter the battlefield. Here is where things get complicated: you will be collecting the spells throughout the strategy map and you will have a limited number of spells that your deck may hold any given time. For each spell acquired, you will also need the appropriate resources which determines how many times that spell can be cast. Thus, you have to establish a careful balance between the game's strategy and card game elements. Easier said than done, this restriction quickly becomes tricky to handle. When you decide to change one card, you can easily find yourself travelling to the other side of the map, while an enemy hero silently marches towards your capital.Graphics are fairly outdated, but still charming enough in my opinion. The environment and character animations are colorful exaggerations that we are already familiar fromWarcraft IIIorKing's Bountyseries. Camera settings are usually a bit distasteful, inconveniently choosing to focus on random figures, but hey! No one promised an A+ game. What we have here is an old, challenging strategy and card game that certainly doesn't hold hands with the player.There is a truckload of negative reviews about the game out there, complaining about constant crashes or not being able to run the game at all on modern systems. These issues are long gone. The worst that you should be expecting is that you may have to run the game from the directory rather than the Steam shortcut which doesn't record playtime. Otherwise, it works fine. The campaign is fairly long - with two concurrently occurring separate scenarios. You can always run an independent strategy or dueling session too.I strongly suggest givingEtherlordsa chance if you either enjoy strategy or card games, or that you'd be curious about a successful combination of the two. Take it when you're feeling up for a challenge.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

No kidding, even normal difficulty will have you thinking over on what kind of strategy and builds you must use to win every campaing map.- Game is played out on a strategic map (similar to HOMM) & tactical battles (collectible card game).Some points to think before trying it out:- Game is Hard. It is a double edged sword...when playing campaign, think of it like a puzzle game (remember HOMM campaigns with impossible odds, but when you knew a particular trick it became easy).- Game runs on a locked 4:3 resolution.- Game pace is rather slow (you can improve it by choosing various game options, but still)However, I would recommend it to anyone born in 20th century. There is also a sequel which is nearly the same but improved (oh the times when sequels were actually good)."

It needs a bit trying, but I succeeded with WIN XP SP2 compatibility mode under WIN 7 / 64 bit. No other changes.This card game is one of the best. I like Etherlords 2 more, because of better graphics and its more polished, but the 1st can be good as well. It is different in the way of the map and moving around, and also because of more resource types. If you don't mind old graphics, it is enjoyable.AI of both games is remarkable. Developers of some new games should be ashamed to see this old game beat their AI."

I use a Pavillion g7 with windows 8.1 and have only had one other (solved) issued with about 70 different games played thru Steam. The game just freezes and you can hear the sound sticking. Only Ctl/Alt/Del will get you out.With that being said I bought the game bundled with Etherlords 2, which works fine and seems like a significantly better game than the original, which I was only able to play in tiny segments.In summary, don't bother with Etherlords, but Etherlords 2 has so far been enjoyable for a follow the path and battle monsters with trading card deck, turn based battles. The battles are interesting due to strategic card play depending on luck of the draw cards.I think I will get bored with this long before it ends, but Etherlords 2 is a well thought out game, despite it's predicessor."

,Not Recommended,270770,16334190,"Posted: 12 June, 2015",all,CelJaded,"A card battling RPG is a great idea for a game, but Etherlords doesn't fulfill that potential. Play Etherlords II instead as it's much more streamlined and enjoyable.Whilst the card dueling portion of Etherlords is robust and enjoyable enough, the strategy/world map portion is simply not fit for purpose.Producing hero units and casting global spells like a Heroes of Might & Magic game holds no weight when the ideal tactic is to simply eliminate the AI’s strongest hero and make a beeline for their temple.As the game goes on you get the feeling that Nival lost faith in the strategy side of Etherlords and quietly downplayed its importance in favour of the superior card battle system.The final battle of the campaign though is problematic as it pitches you in a duel against the sinister White Lord with a totally different hero and every spell in the game unlocked for deck preparation.All of your hard work in building your own personal deck disappears at this point and it becomes a troubleshooting exercise instead of a grand finale to an epic adventure.Read the full retrospective at my blog »"

From the get go the game was confusing, with no real way to tell what you are supposed to do.  No tutorial, or in game instruction at all.  That alone wouldn't bother me much, as I like to figure things out.  However, when you combine that with the fact that the game constantly locks up, and I personally had to completely restart my machine to get out of it, this game is just a frustrating mess."

I am trying to find a solution myself but just something to be aware of for anyone interested in picking up this game.The sequel however from what i can tell does not seem to suffer from this problem. so you have the option to skip over this one and play the sequel instead if you dont feel like risking it or trying to get it working.
