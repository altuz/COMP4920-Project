The player collects cards to build a deck of spells and creatures.  When you approach enemies on the world map you have the opportunity to fight them.  This is where the actual card game starts.  The player takes turn with the enemy casting spells and attacking.  Victory is achieved by killing the opponent.  The card game is surprisingly complex and it feels rewarding when your deck works.  In addition your character levels up and can choose perks that will influence your strategy.  If you enjoy these types of table top games you will probably have fun with Etherlords 2.The problem is...everything else outside the card game. The voice acting is sub par and the movement/animations on the world map are jerky and frustrating.  There is no camera angle that let's you properly see where you're going and there are no resolution options that I could fine.I rushed thought the poor dialog and map navigation as fast as possible so I could get back to actually playing the card game.    If you like card games then I will grudgingly recommend Etherlords 2 because it can be quite fun, but everything else almost spoils the game."

No power steering.Funnily enough, extremely fun.Sadly, far too short.  Something very essential is missing to make this game work, becuase it has soemthing that no other game has out there, a perfect mix of card game, and grid turn based strategy.  so many games out there have tried, and failed.  Simply because they got the basics wrong, this one, I am amazed to say, as bad as it is---got the basics right.Just a shame that's about all it got right,recomended purely for strategy enthusiasts, or developers that want some inspiration."

There were so many unique monsters in it. Where as so many games apply NO creativity at all and just throw in generic monsters, Like spiders, skeletons, werewolves, zombies, orcs, elves and demons, this game steps away from that. It makes its own unique races, creatures and characters. Also it avoids the classic elements of fire vs water earth vs air and so on. It has good enviroments and music. The game may not have the most current graphics but there is a charm to older figure style games. the mechanics are very intricate too. they arnt built around this race beats this one, or these spells beat this, its all about strategy. One build could get wrecked by a lower level wild monster, but trumph a boss. It even has a button that makes it so the game plays for you so you can take a look at its sweet beastiary and magic. I wish there were more games out there like this. A good game isnt something that blows your mind with its rendering or models, its one that keeps you entertained and interested."

For those that are not so comfortable with excessive terminology and tactics however, the easy mode still makes for a fun experience.Whereas the first Etherlords was an interesting proof of concept only, Etherlords II is the inevitable expansion of that idea and one that works a whole lot better.It’s a solid game, one saved by a remarkably diverse battle system and a dizzying array of fun strategies and deckbuilding potential.Read the full retrospective at my blog »"

,Recommended,270790,22000972,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,BadassFreeman,"Do you know anything about Heartstone? Is it that it's kind of a ripoff of Magic The Gathering? Well, Blizzard were not the first ones to rip those damn cards. Etherlords did it first, and I personally think this game still holds up to Heartstone, if what you're looking is a singleplayer experience. As usual I'll start talking about the things the game doesn't do right:The game has a story on it, a story that seems somewhat deep for a card-based game... However, it never got hooked to it. Seriously, it's quite boring. It also doesn't help the story that most characters have less than average voice-acting to them.Another issue I have with it is the difficulty. Most of the enemies in the game are okay, offer a good challenge, and being defeated usually means that you should look at your deck and change your cards, as there's probably a better way to deal with this sh#t. However, one of the races on the game seems to have some balance issues: the Pale race. These guys don't f#ck arround. Some of their monsters are hilariously broken, as they're insultingly hard to kill (they usually just go hollow when you kill them, becoming a ghost but being able to return to life in exchange of mana or other stuff), and some of them deal insane amounts of damage, while also draining your HP. Seriously, build yourself the most broken and lame deck against those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.The last thing is that the multiplayer is long dead. Now there are ways to play with people, even while the servers died years ago by using third-party software... But there's barely anyone who has the game. I HAD IT YEARS AGO WHEN IT RELEASED AND EVEN THEN IT WAS HARD TO PLAY WITH SOMEONE! This game did not get any attention during it's life-time, and it shows.However, is the game good? Holy crap, it is.The gameplay is a real good challenge, an entertaining strategy game were you're always trying to build your deck to get better, but also a game were defeat is usually just the perfect chance to get better. Something like that is hard to pull off.The amount of different cards, races and monsters is also quite great. There are tons of different strategies you can build to yourself, along with the tons of different enchantments, traps, artifacts and other crap you can get your hands on.The level system is also interesting, and I liked it a lot. As you level up, you can select extra passive skills such as regenerating some HP each X turns, getting an extra card each X turns and so on. They really make you feel like your deck and character is unique.Do I recommend this game? Yeah, IF you're a fan of this kind of strategy games. If you like Magic The Gathering, Yu-gi-oh, Heartstone and all of those other weird card based games, you'll like it a lot. If you're not a fan of those but you like strategy games, it might also interest you. If you're neither of those, you should turn arround.Oh, and ♥♥♥♥ Exile. I f#cking hate that spell. It can go f#ck a d#ck sideways on the shadow realm.TL:DR Edition: Old card based game that ripped off Magic The Gathering, mostly singleplayer because of dead multiplayer. If you like Heartstone and other card games, give it a try on a sale."

76561197995669628,Recommended,270790,13619098,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,Sorokonojka,"Etherlords 2 is a card game with 3D Models ,5 unique races and challenging campaign . Gameplay is similar to regular card games with some overtop map exploration like in Heros of Might & Magic. Multiplayer community is very much dead but singleplayer campaign is fun enough by itself .This game is pretty old and does not support high resolution so expect bad texture . However it has very creative artsyle and design overall .Etherlords2 has more depth than most modern games . Aside from basic spells and creatures you also can level up your hero to gain unique abilities and use several different artifacts. There is also some resource management as you will have to buy/sell cards in shops and look for resources around the map . Defense phase is very extensive and many creatures are designed around that extra step that most card games do not have .AI is suprisingly good which is funny because this game is way older than hearthstone . It actually uses synergy combos and saves cards for them . Infact sometimes AI will save he's units if he knows that you have favorable trade.The campaign plays similar to Heroes of might and Magic but with less features ( Etherlords 1 had castles but this game droped that completely ) . Some fights can take you 50+ tries even with the right deck . Its very fun to build specific decks to kill overpowered opponents which is kinda similar to Hearthstone Boss fights .The best way to play this game is HotSeat PVP or over 2 computers with a friend but single player campaign is enjoyable too . You can probably use 3d party software to find oldschool players but at that point it's not worth the hussle for me .Selling Etherlord2 for $1 is insulting because it should be considered PC classic . If you like card games give it a chance .Score : 8/10 Considering the age of this game I think it is amazing for what it is . It is not perfect and the are some design flaws like redundant overtop map exploration . The core of this game is  advance and fun card game and one of the best games at that ."

They left me a little concerned as they seemed to be mostly based on nostalgia for this game or for the genre/era.It starts off a little rough with few actual tactical (per encounter) or strategic (long ranging) choices. The card management interface is clunky which is exasperated by the constant need to devise specialty decks. Each new non-grind opponent comes with his own specialty battlefield that harmonizes with their decks leaving you to more often than not have to rebuild your deck. About halfway through the first half every fight was pretty trivial using one or two decks, with no way of being able to anticipate which deck was the the good choice for the encounter. As you cannot ascertain what the specialty battlefield will be until you suffer it the first attempt.*Minor Spoiler*About halfway through you switch up your POV taking on a new Protagonist and reseting your deck. At this point the game lost what little enjoyment it had for me. You get zero options as far as deck configuration, so you have to play it as is, and it is not designed to handle the next few opponents. The battles were not complex or interesting, but as the battlefield was designed for them it become a long odds roll of the dice to win.In the end I would say unless this was one of your early fell-in-love with games or you massively love the genre of early card games give this one a pass."

I played it a lot many years ago, and its just good to do it again.If you have a bad/weak PC at your office, but still want to spend some time playing, while your boss is not looking, you should try this.

I do wish it had more resolution options, but that's a small quibble.You have 18 (or 16, can't remember) spell / card slots and as you progress through the story you build your deck. In combat, you get a random hand from that pool with additional cards each turn. I do like the mana system - it's not cards like a lot of card games. Your mana increasea over time and can be boosted with spells (and you can reduce your opponent's). Feels nice."

Its similar as good as playing Magic the Gathering, but with many features making it different from a traditional card game. The turn-base abilities are actually like playing cards of MoM, there is the deck-building aspect that I consider mandatory for these kind of games, and there are artifacts you can trigger in a turn etc. The variety of cards is as needed to maintain interest, and since I played this game also before getting the steam version, I have gladly finished two of the races campains twice. The AI, one of the most important aspects in this kind of games, is 'clever' and challenging, even if at some point a specific enemy could be strongly specialised to one kind of attack-approach.Even if the game is really old, the visuals are not at all annoyingly audated. Dont expect fabulous light effects etc, but the graphics are still pleasant to the aye, and not a big deal at games like this in any case.The original CD version allowed for LAN multiplayer, and Steam version allows for multiplayer via a loby. Note that the loby is actually empty-abandoned, so you need to phonecall a friend so the both of you get in the loby to multiplay. But even if multiplayer is now harder to achieve, single play experience definetly worths the money on this game. I had and still will have many-many hours of fun with Etherlords II.Definately recommended from my end!"

Unfortunately there are no mission maps provided at the steam version of this, so this is pretty much a rip off to me, who enjoyed vastly the skirmish maps of first games. There does not seem to be any maps available to download either so I am considering a refund, not because of the price of measly 2 euros, but for the thought of being scammed.Will just go find my old Etherlords 1 and enjoy that some more I suppose. Didn't bother testing with the campaign. It was good in Etherlords 1, but not the thing that attracted myself.The game itself is a charm, even though it's quite old. If you enjoy Magic the gathering kind of card games or TCGs in general, this game might be for you. Etherlords 2 is not so much about map control from what I heard but I didn't have much chance to test the mission kind of gameplay anyways so how would I know.If you want just the core TCG part of the game, sure.
