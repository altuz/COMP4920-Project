The problem isn't the fact that it goes fast (i like fast games), the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility. You HAVE to jump to pass the wall, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed unless you are lucky with the layout.And the game hasn't much to offer, it's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind (it takes hours in order to be able to buy an uninspired upgrade)There are so many better endless runners, free and paying, I can't find the appeal of this one."

It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version.Gameplay.You play as Emma Jones. She's a firefighter and your mission is to guide her along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, you'll collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more.The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios.Graphically it's clearly based onMinecraftfashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.Jones On Firecould have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions,Jones On Firedoesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.Positive points. (+)Sincerely, none.Negative points. (-)Bland, annoying and repetitive gameplay.The progression system is weird and isn't nothing funny. Lots of gameplay required to unlock some basic improvements.The camera is quite bad (doesn't fit to the game speed).Bad controls. The only two are clicking and arrow controls, however the clicking controls aren't explained in depth, while the arrow controls only work on the arrow keys themselves, not WASD, what can hurt the hand/wrist.I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good."
,Recommended,270810,17070126,"Posted: 15 July, 2015",all,Hanging Bunny,I highly recommend this adorable game.  This is a runner type gameplay but the levels change up so you cannot just memorize the route.The sounds are well matched to the game.  The visuals are bright and cartoony but still clear enough that you can easily tell what is going on.You can play only a few minutes at a time or hours on end if you want.  Trust me you can quickly get addicted and spend an entire afternoon trying to get some more of those precious golden kitties!If you are looking for a fun way to blow off some steam at the end of a workday (or on a break) this is the game for you.Plus you wouldn't want to leave those poor kittens in the way of that nasty fire would you?

It's accessible if you're not a superstar gamer, but definitely challenging enough for more advanced gamers (save ALL the kitties!). I played it first on iOS, and I'm delighted to be able to play it on my Mac as well. I haven’t tried setting up a controller yet, but I think that would be an even better way to play (there isn’t native support, but with a little effort it should work).I also highly recommend the sorta-sequel, Hot Tin Roof."

,Recommended,270810,17554704,"Posted: 15 August, 2015",all,Lu Zhishen,"Extremely charming and delightful runner-style game that revolves around kitties and the saving thereof. The more you play, the more deceptively complex it becomes; the controls are simple, but the ways in which they're used in combination with the landscape and obstacles offers a great ""just one more go"" experience. Makes you work for unlocks, but they change the game considerably, so it stays a fresh experience run after run. If you like elegant arcade-style games, and you like kitties, buy this game immediately. If you don't like kitties, you belong in a dungeon."

A game which is fast, both in gameplay (accurate and quick response to actions, also gets quite fast in its...jumpy slidyness pretty quickly) and lagginess (where I turned the graphics up to fantastic and had no gameplay issues, and this is a laptop that can't play Cod WAW), humerous and witha dark and disturbing plothats, nice sound effects and music.What should be added in the future:While in your concrete barricade you should be able to move cats, paintings and furniture etc. or at least have some sort of response from themController supportWith these adjustments it would make a good game, a perfect one, thankyou for your time"

It's all been done before, but it is done EXTREMELY well here, and the price is right. Great music, endearing graphics, and I really appreciate the female protagonist."

Whenever you ran out of lives then you have to spend Gold K.If you can't spend golden K to buy lives again. Then you will start all the way back to level 1 again.Upgrades and challenges will NOT be lost whenever you are restarting back to level 1.You can recover a health bar by outrunning the fire wall.Game is very easy to understand and to pickup.The Parkour will be changed whenever you have died on the level.Other things.Jones is a girl...Mew :3-------------------I Give this game a 7/10

,Recommended,270810,18781855,"Posted: 30 October, 2015",all,Kelpula,"Simplistic, stereotypical, yet, also entertaining.This game is just super cute in its own little way, analogizing to Jetpack Joyride with its constant fast-paced action game, or Temple Run's classic past-time activity. Or just even compare to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Flappy Bird. It may look like I'm just comparing only somewhat similar games, but what they all have in common is that certain types of feeling you experience while playing the game.This game seemed to be suited for people who like classic, or even just small-looking Phone games. [Specifically to people who fall for cute kitties!]Pros:Fun, time-waster.Gets more challenging as one progresses, so it doesn't get bland quicklyKitties! Lots and lots of Kitties for you!It also appeals to your Pathological emotion, when you lose all of those lives, not being able to save those kitties ahead, you always got infinite second chances, no matter how much you have to walk on flaming logs and slide through flames![* Powerups!]Cons:I had this on a seperate account, and I remember that:The only problem I had with this game was 'shortness', this game just needed a few game modes, I mean, once you get all the power ups, [takes a while] and also all the other items, thats where it actually seems to get bland at, because there isn't much to do after that."

Not worth 3 bucks or whatever it goes for normally, but if you get it on sale and sell the trading cards, it's about a net loss of 30 cents, and it's worth that. It's structured kind of like a mobile game in that it has an in game social media function, currencies, and a simple, 2 button game mechanic. These, however, do not take away from the fun of the game.Regardless, if you like cats or know someone who likes cats, it's worth the 30 cents for a giggle or 2 and the righteous feeling of saving felines."
