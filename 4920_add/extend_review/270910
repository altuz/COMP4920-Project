There's no good online (yeah, wtf Team17), no steamworks matchmaking, I don't remember seeing a direct IP connection so I guess you will have to use Hamachi and similar software to play with friends without lag, because there's just this UK Wormnet master server where I was unable to join a single damn match and there's no people whatsoever, ""the perfect online gaming experience""?! yeah sure. Did I mention the game crashed 3 times in 20 minutes? what the hell? and there are people having compatibility and optimization issues as well in the forums. I heard people having FPS problems as well, so yeah, another strike.Don't bother buying this, don't even think of it, is a copy-paste of the original game with no improvement aside from the 1080p gameplay, all it's features could be achieved with a free mod for t he original game. If you are wondering why I don't have this in my library anymore, it's because I asked for a refund, you should do the same. Developers should learn how to do a proper ""remastered"", don't give them your money so they can undestand that and stop releasing lazy games like this.If you want a true 2D Worms experience, buy Armageddon."
,Not Recommended,270910,17111582,"Posted: 18 July, 2015",all,Aro,"FIrst of all, let's make one thing clear: All of the negative reviews, including this one, are not towards the actual gameplay,Worms World Partywas a fantastic game all those years ago, and is just as much fun to play today, same asWorms 2and of course,Worms Armageddon. The reason for the masses of bad reviews is because Team 17's idea of ""Remastered"" is far from the truth of what a remastered version of a game should be. As a seasoned fan of the Worms series ever since the Amiga days, it really pains me to click ""Not Recommended"" on this review...Worms World Party Remastered, it's essentially exactly the same as the original, but with 1080p In-game Graphics (this does not include the in-game menus unfortunately) and 60 FPS gameplay, both of which have been a part ofWorms Armageddonfor a long time now, so ultimately it's nothing new, and seeming as how they're almost exactly the same game, it feels very much like we have been cheated paying £10.00 for something that isn't new and far from actually being remastered.Worms World Partyitself does offer a handful of features and content that were never included inWorms Armageddon, the Wormpot options for example make for a ton of unique options to give the gameplay a litlte more variety, it also has more missions and a co-op online mode, but aside from that,Worms Armageddonis easily still the superior game due-to the fact that it has recieved constant updates for many, many years after it's release.What I expected to get fromWorms World Party Remasteredwas the second coming of aWorms Armageddonso to speak, the entire game being completely remastered, updated and with a new layer of polish to compensate for todays standards, but most of the updated and awesome features included inWorms Armageddonwere not included inWorms World Party Remastered, what we were left with was nothing more than an option to use some remastered sound effects as opposed to the classic ones. I am thankful that the new sounds are fully optional instead of being forced down your throat though as it just doesn't feel the same without the classics.Right now, this needs a lot of work to justify it's price tag and the title of ""Remastered"", online play doesn't even work properly as of the moment without some pain-staking workarounds (see the 'Guides' section on the Community Hub), the frame rate can sometimes be incredibly choppy and the fact that Team 17 didn't think to include the updates that Worms Armageddon received just baffles me...Just before this was released, they delayed it's release a little longer after discovering a bug that they wanted to fix first, which shows Team 17 care about their products, they always have done and I salute them for that, but re-releasing a game that hit shelves over a decade ago whenWorms Armageddonis already available and vastly superior is just something that I can't support.I am hoping that this game gets the patches that it deserves and truly needs to live up to what we all hoped it would be, but until that happens, I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this to anybody else, I even told my brothers to steer well clear of this game and stick withWorms Armageddoninstead, and I give the same advice to all of you. Don't pay for an inferior product when there is a better and very similar option available instead."

Enable blood, x2 damage etc.. Something Worms Armageddon never had.Cons:- Menus are 640x480- No Windowed Mode (If you have double or more screen your mouse can easily go to the other screens while you are playing)- Almost impossible to play online. Even Armageddon have 60-100 online players in their lobbies. WWPR have max 10 players. (Same like other Worms games - I am looking at you 3D Worms games - unable to play online because of lack of players)- Even you find enough people to play. You need to struggle like 15 to 90 minutes open ports, change your net settings etc to host a decent game. Even at Worms Armageddon you can easily host a game with hostingbuddy but not at wwpr.- Some voices are wrong, missing.If you have Worms Armageddon or Worms World Party do not buy that game. If you dont have well I think Worms Armageddon is still better. At least you can able to play online... Waited like 2 weeks for WWPR (released with 1 week delay) and I am just heartbroken."
,Not Recommended,270910,17080332,"Posted: 16 July, 2015",all,Schlinkay,"I was expecting this game to be fully modernised for PCs of today since the old version's menu and gameplay are in low resolution, the controls are slightly awkward, and online play was sometimes hard to get working (I feel as if that's okay considering the game came out in 2001 before Steam.)They promised us an improved frontend and 1080p/60FPS which as a customer I can assume it was for the entire game, but upon purchase and launch I found that the main menu ran at 640x480 which is exactly the same as the original release of the game, and the mouse movement in menus was far too sensitive with no way to change it at all. I didn't see a keyboard rebinding menu at all in the options, only a button that opens a screen displaying gamepad controls. The keyboard controls were awkward because I had to use the jump button before I could even move at all, and the keybinds were not displayed for me anywhere.I am severly disappointed with the quality of this game and I hope that they take the criticism recieved on board. If they bring this game's quality up to the standard expected then I'll be happy to re-purchase."

The only changes applied is the 1080p option, and adding ""Remastered"" to the title's name. You might be dissapointed about this game. You might feel like ""Oh  boy, WWP! What a nostalgic game, I can't wait to play it!"" And unfortunately you have became, or will become something like ""Well, this is even worse than the original WWP lol.""Well if you want to get the retro Worms experience you were looking for, I suggest you to refund this game and buy Worms Armageddon instead. You may thinking ""Why? Worms Armageddon is prequel of Worms World Party. Probably it's even worse."" Well guess what? It's far better game than you can imagine. It's the perfect online gaming expreince Team17 talking about. Well though, funny thing is Team17 didn't do much to improve, the superiorities of WA are there thanks to it's fanbase and 2 coder (Deadcode and Cybershadow) hired by Team17 from community to make patches.Well you might be wondering why should I refund WWPR, and get WA instead? What are those superior features of WA? You may think I'll just wait a bit for WWPR to get his patches etc. Well, don't wait! Everything you are waiting for is in Worms Armageddon!Let me count some, for example bigger sized map support, you can play on maps with any size, you can play on any png-8 bit maps in WA. Also replay recording. You can watch played games exactly how they happened. And replay files are ridicilously small, such as between 100kb-500 kb. And there are very active community, with over 50 new game modes. There are active leagues working with replay sharing, if you win a game, you send your replay as a proof for your victory. And you can watch every replay of any game whenever you want. There are over 200k games played on leagues so far! And it's still active. For example, the recent games page of the most active league, TUS:http://tus-wa.com/leagues/recent-games/About new game modes I previously mentioned. For example, you remember the famous ninja rope right? Imagine racing on a map with it, it's called Rope Race in WA. An example video of a Rope Race:www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXJpLQldlJ4Well, do you want to know what other spectacular features the game has? Check this video on wormtube, to understand why Worms Armageddon is so superior to Worms World Party Remastered:http://wormtube.worms2d.info/81/wa_beta_showdownYou might be thinking is this a Worms Armageddon promotion or WWP Remastered review? Well the reason why I talked about WA is, WA became a such game with only 2 people and the fanbase. And Team17, after all those years, with all the resources they had, they can't even come up with a better game. That's why this game is so bad and that's why I lost my respect against Team17. And I want people to have the game they deserve, Worms Armageddon."

It could be because of my graphics drivers but I don't have this issue with other games.The mouse cursor still tracks like it is on a 4:3 screen so moving up and down is normal but left and right movements of the cursor are just too fast.I have 3 screens and WWP was playing in the centre screen.Now the game menu runs in psudeo full screen which caused some issues.When you move the mouse to the left or right of the game window you actually scroll on to the other screens that arent used in the game. You try to move the cursor back to the game screen and it sometimes blocks the cursor leaving it on the unused screen.I had to move the cursor back and forth a few times and it eventually went back to the game screen. N.B. because the left and right scroll is accelerated due to the 4:3 stretch you can get the cursor to the middle screen but I actually had the cursor go from my left screen, past the WWP screen in the middle, and to my right screen because the cursor was so fast in the game screen.Starting a game is just like it used to be on the original WWP but the stretched menus just don't look nice.Once in a game it played just like it used to.The updated sounds were nice but just didn't match the graphics.The graphics are the same as the original WWP and the old soundbanks just fit better.Moving the cursor off the screen isn't a problem during a game since moving the mouse will just move the camera or weapon selection cursor.The game defaulted to my 2560x1440 graphics but the game didn't run like it was 60FPS.It was a bit choppy and just seemed dated.I quit the match changed the graphics to 1680x1050.I loaded a match and it was smooth but still looked the same as WWP back in the day.I quit WWP completely and saw that because I changed the game resolution to a lower resolution than my 2560x1440 desktop it had shifted all of my cursors that were on the lower part of the desktop up higher!Luckily I have DesktopOK running so I can just restore the icons to their original positions easily but this is just rediculous.This game was a rushed port, which is odd since they had delays, and I recommend only die hard Worms fans purchase it.I didn't try online play and only had a quick few test solo games and it plays ok in lower resolutions but the implimentation of the game seems like it's still designed for Windows 95/98 or XP.One other issue that I encountered was loading the game.If you load the game and in the part with the developer Team 17 and Tick Tock names appear you click on a different screen the game screen will minimize but you can't restore it.Alt-Tab doesn't show the game is running and I had to kill W2.exe with task manager to quit and then I reloaded the game.There's just too many issues with the game and I think it should have been redesigned for Windows 7/8/10 not just ported like this.Team 17 please release some major patches to fix everything that is broken so we can enjoy this game on our new computers without these issues."

,Not Recommended,270910,17182574,"Posted: 22 July, 2015",all,Ben [PortsCenter.TV],"The only ""remastering"" they've done is improve the screen resolution in-game (frontend menus are still 640x480), replace the in-game sound effects with sounds from later Worms games (which can thankfully be turned off) and touched up some of the frontend graphics.Other than that, it's almost identical to WWP at launch, which means it lacks many of the features, enhancements and improvements that come with the similarly-priced Worms Armageddon. The game also struggles to run on modern systems - I get, at best, 35 FPS, compared with the 60 FPS I get in Worms Armageddon.If you really want the featureset of WWP, wait for a major patch. If you just want a good Worms game, get Worms Armageddon instead. It's the same price, uses a near-identical game engine, and runs a Hell of a lot nicer.TL;DR - Not remastered, possibly broken.

However, this still doesn't remove the annoyance factor and occasional issues caused by the low resolution menu.**Original Review**I've spent countless hours playing the original version of Worms World Party on the Sega Dreamcast. When I saw the announcement that this was coming in a ""remastered"" version to PC I could not have been more excited.Unfortunately, this game did not deliver like I thought it would on Day 1. As many others have noted, the menu screen is at a very low resolution. With Team17 touting 1080p and 60FPS, one would think that they would deliver this ""standard"" throughout every aspect of the game.All I can say is this... If you are interested in this game, just give it some more time for Team17 to fix some of the Day 1 issues. However, with the ""trend"" in gaming of companies delivering broken products on Day 1, I am not happy that Team17 fell into this trap as well.A bit of a PSA to game companies: Please delay your game if you know it is not ready for release yet.

Maybe it wasn't clear for some people previously, so I'll try again to make them understand better about my opinion on this game:As a Worms Ultimate Mayhem player, I was curious about this WWPR and I purchased it to find out if it's a good Worms. The thing is, I couldn't have gone far enough. Why? Probably not because of the game itself, which seems quite feature-rich and fun for some players here. I requested (and obtained) a refund because of the so-called remastering we've been promised. I think it is just some kind of emulation of the old game, with some tweaks to ensure it works on the latest Windows:1-Menus and UI (in Menus) aren't upscaled, they are stuck to default resolution from back then when the game was released for the first time;2-There's no Windowed mode (I guess it wasn't available in the first release either, but for a remaster, we could have expected to see such a ""basic"" feature available on day one);3-Alt+Tab should be avoided with this game (I was stuck once, unable to do anything with the mouse, I had to open the task manager and kill the game, hurray...);4-The 1080p/60 fps combo: 1080p only during a match, and framerate usually drops to 50 and below.Selling a game with such a price for such a lazy emulation is quite steep...You'd better keep playing at your current Worms titles than buying this one."

I do not consider myself a negative or toxic person, but this ""remastered"" version is bringing out the worst part of me.Me and my mates have been playing Worms World Party on LAN for ages now. We've used the original version, and that have been troublesome and exhausting at times. But more often than not we managed to pull through all the nonsense and actually have fun. We were very happy to see that Team 17 was going to release a remastered version and put it on Steam. We really didn't care much about the updated graphics, we just wanted to enjoy this little gem over the internet.So why am I fuming? Why am I not recommending this game?Well for starters, they really didn't remaster anything. It's so called 1080 - 60 FPS, but that is simply not true. It's a blatant ♥♥♥♥ing lie. Whenever you blow something up (and that is the ♥♥♥♥ING PURPOSE OF THE GAME), the whole screen freezes and the game drops BELOW 1 fps. And keep in mind this game is older than♥♥♥♥♥♥ And this happens for everyone in all game modes. Have Team 17 ever heard about testing? How the ♥♥♥♥ can a bug like that be able to survive to the launch? Are everyone at Team 17 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?I must admit I was a bit disappointed about that. But you know what, for me it is not game breaking. You can still enjoy a nice round of fun Worms with your friends even if the FPS is terrible. So why am I still not going to recommend this game?Because you can not play over the internet. Well you can sometimes. A few times. But mostly you can't. Wormnet is really unstable, or it is something else with the game that is really unstable. Team 17 doesn't know. Team 17 doesn't care. Team 17 can suck my hairy testicles. And it really doesn't make any sense as to when or why you can or can't play the game online.I'm gonna round this review off with a friendly tip for whoever is in charge of remastering things at Team 17. When you remaster stuff, please make sure it works, please make sure the game does not get WORSE than the original game. Because when people buy a remastered version of a game they already own, and the remastered version eats donkeyass compared to the original game, people are going to be upset. And the bugs and problems with the remastered version are not exactly very well hidden and only affects very few people. They ARE VERY VISIBLE AND AFFECTS EVERYONE!"

(not that there's many people to compete with...)this game doesn't utilize any of the features added to Worms Armageddon over the past 14 years. not that it really matters because it would have been a wasted effort anyway. this release was dead on arrival and will never revive.the new sound effects are taken from some of the latest Worms games, they are not exactly new. most of them fit well enough, but it is good that they are optional. the implied""Full Controller Support""is just a lie, as there is no way to remap any of the buttons. unless you have a xbox controller, you are better off just using software like joy2key. not sure why anyone would want to play this game with a controller anyway.""Imagine taking the perfect online gaming experience""; as far as Worms go, that's Worms Armageddon. it is updated and maintained by people who actually care about the game. team17 do not even know what made armageddon so great and keep on releasing inferior and unnecessary additions to the franchise. this release in particular is a cheap cash grab pandering to nostalgia, for the people who are not aware that WA exists and has been taken care of.what should have been done instead is a DLC(and a free update for owners of the original WWP)for Worms Armageddon that migrates all original Worms World Party content to the better version of the engine. when (if ever, hopefully) WWP exclusive content becomes usable in WA, all iterations of WWP will become fully obsolete."

No.Worms World Party is at it's core, the great 2D Worms game that we have all come to love over the years. It is Worms at it's greatest.However, this game is being sold under false pretenses. Instead of having the title 'Worms World Party Remastered', it should actually be called 'Worms World Party Steam Edition'. Team 17 have taken Worms World Party and done as little work as possible in order to get it working with modern computers and modern monitors.The standout improvements to the game are 1080p support, and controller support. The problem is that these are about the only major improvements to this nearly 15 year old game and even those improvements come with caveats. For instance, the 1080p support is only when in game. The main menus have not been improved from the 15 year old game and are extremely low resolution. Controller support feels a bit tacked on as things like scrolling and positioning don't work as well as they should.It is quite obvious that this is just a port of the original game as many of the limitations of the original are still present. Probably the most egregious of these issues is the way multiplayer is handled. More specifically hosting of multiplayer games. You can't install the game then go straight into hosting multiplayer games. In order to host a game you first need to go into your router and set up port forwarding. You then need to edit the registry and finally you need to enter your WAN IP address into the game. This is unacceptable.The hosting issue alone has nearly killed the community for this game dead. I have seen the ridiculous situation where there were 10 people in a lobby all wanting to play a multiplayer game but none of them could host a game so no one could play. I ended up writing a Steam guide to try and help people get around this problem.It is this hosting problem which I think has led to the multiplayer being pretty much dead. The game has only been out for a week and the average player count is 9.5 players per hour(http://steamcharts.com/app/270910). This number is also made up of people playing single player as well. Good luck trying to find a multiplayer game.Then there is the menus. They look like they are presented in 640x480 resolution and they look dated design wise as well. When in game the resolution is 1080p but the weapon select screen is not scaled properly so is very small and makes it difficult to see what the icons are.Those are the major issues but there are quite a few other little niggles.This game is not a remaster. It is a quick cash grab. The original game has had a minimal amount of work done to it to make it compatible with modern computers and that is about it.We have been complaining to Team 17 on the forums and the Team 17 rep told us he would have a plan of action to present to us in order to improve the game by the end of the week. The end of the week has come and gone with no word from the rep.I believe it is pretty unlikely that the game will ever be improved as there is no financial incentive for Team 17 to do so. The game is dead on arrival.Basically I would say to any potential buyers, don't do it. Don't support Team 17 who have taken the good will of their fans for granted for too long. This is a quick cash grab and the game has no future. Don't waste your money or time on this."

I am dead serious when I say that my old PS1 version of this game ran smoother. Seriously, this is the fastest I have ever had the hype train derail completely.I can't make the game run fullscreen at 1920 x 1080p. For some reason, there's some letterboxing going on and the aspect ratio looks more like 21:9.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=538793258<--- This is the only aspect I can play the game at. The dynamic zoom seems to be broken, at least for me.Attempting to change the screen resolution or render quality softlocks the game. Always a sign of quality.No AA-settings ensures that all the edges look like crap. Come on, it's 2015, this shouldn't be this hard. I swear the game looks so much better when I force AA through my graphics card settings.Another sad part is the criminal lack of game modes in the multiplayer game menu. There's no ""for fun"" mode with all weapons. And I mean ALL. Don't hide away the concrete donkey, guys. I remember my PS1 version having a metric butt-ton of pre-defined weaponsets and half of them seem to be missing.The interface for the terrain generator/pre-made backdrops is abysmal. Worms Armageddon / Worms 2 has a better one. In a HD remake, I expect to have a proper preview instead of the gallery thumbnail.The game seems to abandon all settings you toggle. I tried to turn off the remastered audio, but the game clearly didn't agree with me and checked the box right back like I had offended it dearly.Font rendering is also screwed. Team17, if you want to include an ümlaut Ü in your game, pick a font that supports it. It is jarring as all hell to see a letter rendered in Arial just sit there, being taller and blockier than any other text.TL;DR the boxed copy I got fourteen years ago that was bundled with a shockwave-based installer somehow manages to run better than the remaster.EDIT: No Low Gravity mode.

On the first launch of this game on my Sony 4k TV I saw a little box in the middle (which is 640x480 as a few guys pointed out here) and lots of stupid clouds flying around, the worst here is that I could't choose anything - Steam Controller just didn't do nothing. None of the buttons helped, so I went to PC (4k resolution normal for today) and what you think..? Again no luck, then I turned of BIG SCREEN MODE and tried it only from PC - no luck again, no luck also with lowered resolution.UPDATE - I really TRIED to play the game for another hour. Actually it was again playing with all the settings on the PC and steam link I could ever think of. Changing resolution actually did not helped me at all, so I went back to original 4k resolution on the PC and additionally forced v-sync (as someone noted in the comments) + I also turned on hardware scaling on my Radeon settings, which actually help with the menu looking way better. Haven't launched the worms fight itself (only playing in the main menu, but it still did not help me to make Steam controller work (doesn't do anything in the game) - will try again maybe tomorrow for the last time."

It was referred to many as a big disappointment, because it hardly offered anything extra to the plate – Wormpot (where you can alter the game in various ways), some extra single play missions, a mission editor… and precious little else.In Mid 2015 – Worms World Party Remastered was released on Steam. Once again, the new features were very minimal. It boasted higher resolution (which Worms Armageddon had YEARS ago), Steam Trading Cards, Achievements and a few other things that in my opinion, were not very noteworthy.Thankfully I bought this on a sale at around £3, and that was only to revisit the single play missions. There was no way I was going to fork out £10.99 for this half-baked product.PROS:-	Achievements and Trading Cards, which is something I guess.-	Wormpot offers a lot of diversity. You can have permanent Double Damage, Super Rope, or Unlimited Crate Shower           to name but a few selections.-	A lot of Single Play Missions. Although some are pretty samey, some are really unique and actually quite fun to play.-       The Mission Editor is also fun to use; good if you're the creative type and you know a group of friends who will play your missions.CONS:-	Let’s get the biggest problem of the game dealt with first. Online Multiplayer is virtually non-existent. Compare that to Worms Armageddon, where you usually see twenty plus people during the evening (UK), here, you are lucky to see one person at any time. This is a major issue, especially since multi-play is the absolute foundation of Worms.-	Although Wormpot is a unique feature, about 75% of the options to choose from are just plain uninteresting and lazy. High powered Firearms, High Powered Animals, High Powered this, High Powered That. We’re not all kids that crave ‘big-boom’ weapons. It just shows a lack of originality.-	The screen feels ‘choppy’ , and that’s with all the features cut down. Likely, this is something I encounter on my computer only, but when Worms Armageddon runs smoothly on the same resolution, why am I having issues here?-	No features to unlock. It was a rewarding experience in Worms Armageddon, where you got an extra utility or an extra option to modify should you complete a mission. Here, everything is unlocked at the start – so it doesn’t feel all that satisfying when you do beat a hard challenge. Then again, there isn’t really a lot more features at the start anyway.-	The Steam Achievements, again, are unimaginative. Complete all the missions, Complete Deathmatch, Drown 100 worms… yeah fair enough, but the majority are pretty lame and can honestly be accomplished by accident. Woo, I attacked the same worm with the bow and arrow twice. Wow! Have an achievement!Overall, Worms World Party is the inferior younger brother to Worms Armageddon. Unless you can get it really cheap – and that’s really just for the single play missions – don’t waste your money here.52/100"

Other than that, it’s practically the exact same game from when it first debut.So if you liked Worms World Party when it first came out and still enjoy it today, then I highly recommend getting it.

,Recommended,270910,17309281,"Posted: 30 July, 2015",all,Lenmacca,"This is Worms World Party, just the way I remember it. It's the best Worms game ever made, and, after years of terrible Worms games and 3D, it has aged remarkably well. Running without issues on Windows 10.It's getting alot of justified criticism due to the word 'Remastered'--it shouldn't be called a remaster, rather a 'Steam edition'. It is false advertising. This is because the game has  is still in the original resolution outside the gameplay, and not much has actually been 'remastered', apart from the gameplay, which is in 1080p and a solid 60fps. It's the same game with more resolution options tacked on and Steamworks support.However, why would this matter? Of all the games, a 2D Worms game is the last one that needs to be in 1080p and 60fps. There are also new audio and sound effects, which, as a fan of the original release in 2001, I really appreciate.This is the same game that shipped in 2001, with 1080p gameplay and new audio. However, despite the false advertising, I'm still inclined to give this a positive review. This is because this is a working version of Worms World Party for modern operating systems--the old 2001 'Sold Out' version, which I still own a physical copy of, no longer works with Windows 7, nevermind Windows 10 which I recently upgraded to. I have been longing to play Worms World Party again for many years, so I am thrilled to be able to do that again.So in short, if you don't care about the false advertising and, like me, just want to play LAN or Local games of Worms World Party for nostalgic value or fun, pick it up. It was my first Worms game, and has always been my favourite, due to the amount of fond memories I have of it :)"

However, there is no denying that whilst it hasn't undergone any radical changes, the result is that this is still the same Worms World Party we know and love, for the same price as Worms Armageddon on Steam, and arguably offering a superior experience due to the new ""WormPot"" modes and the added controller support, which is surprisingly well-implemented.Originally, ther menus were rendered in 640x480, but with a new update, the menus have now been vastly improved with much nicer graphics and fon, not that the menus actually looked any worse with the old resolution. As for the ""remastered"" sound effects, I really quite like them, they sound a lot nicer than WWP's original sound effects, and if you turn them off you've basically just got the original Worms World Party."

It feels a litlle bit cluncky when playing online and i think that feature should be improved but overall if you are interested in anything other than the online experience you should definitely check this out.Edit1: After some more hours into the game i finally understood where all the bad reviews where coming from. The main problem is definitely in the online version. The menus are very old and outdated and its hard to create an half decent room to play in. The only availble server is the one that was created in 2001 in the UK.

It's nice that they are trying to resurrect Worms World Party and all, but the ressurection attempt is still buggy and has almost no players online. Worms Armageddon on the other hand is significantly better maintained and actually HAS a large community of players in multiplayer."
