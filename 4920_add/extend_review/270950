Pretty much same engine it seems, with different machines, slightly different ""economics"", but generally more of the same, but just up and down mountains, instead of fields. Only buy this if Farming Simulator isn't enough for you, otherwise stick to FS, which is the superior game."
,Recommended,270950,8979784,"Posted: 4 February, 2014",all,Warondar,"Being a big fan of Giants Software's Farming Simulator series, I was very curious about Ski Region Simulator when I first saw it.  Being Canadian, you just have to love snow, or at least like it, if you're to remain sane living here.  A love of skiing might be something you'd think of useful of this game, but you won't be snapping your boots into those bindings and shred the slopes in Whistler or Blackcomb.  You get to manage a ski resort with some pretty detailed aspects of the whole business.You start off with just 2 stations which are connected by a ski slope, and you need to ensure there's enough powder there and that it's groomed just right, which is a bit hard packed for my taste, but it's not back-country heli skiing in deep powder.There are helicopters flying around, the rescue kind, but you don't get to fly them, only bring the 'injured' skiers from some of the missions to the helipad for medivac.You get to buy more ski stations, from small to very large ones, which cost more based on their size.  Own the stations at either end of a ski slope and you own it.Then you get to build small to large support buildings all over the mountain, and these include from a simple Tourist Information outlet, to full size Conference Halls, Spa Retreats, Movie Theaters, and so on.You get to choose what kind of service is offered in each building, which have a few selections for each one.  The trick is to cover all demographics of your guests/clients, and the game has some nice statistical breakdowns to help you manage your resort.  Young, Adult, Young Senior, Family, Single, Couple, Romantic, Party, Business, poor, middle-class, rich, and so on.  Lots of info and details to manage day to day, even hour to hour.And of coure, the best part!  You get to drive all kinds of heavy machinery and 'play' in the snow.All in all I'm really enjoying this Giants title, and the Gold edition includes both DLC packs.  Also, there's some mods available, but not many.  I think the best mods for the game have been made, and still being made, by Don Chris which can be found here: (Apparently posting a link in your review is considred 'spamming'.)  So let me try to cheat here by masking the website for you.   donchris.jimdo dot comAll in all I'm very happy with this game and glad I finally decided to buy it."

Kind of turned me off. Would still recommend this game, however. The modding community for this game is quite large. You'll be able to find plenty of better maps, along with other scripts and vehicles that hugely improve the game along with simulation capabilities. The way I play the game, it's actually multi-faceted and not as boring as originally.Bottom line: Vanilla game is awful, but with modifications it could be made great. 7/10.Recommended links:https://srs-2012.modhoster.com/andhttp://www.austrianmodding.at/"

Physics aren't nessisarily perfect but atleast work.  A great deal of micromanagement is involved.  Its less take care of the slopes, more take care of the resort guest needs.  A decent selection of vehicles, they are setup to add some DLC for sure.  If you want to make money quickly it involves alot of mission running.  You can't ski but you can certainly go crazy on a snowmobile or the tracked hummer.  Overall 7/10"

I personally found it very immersive, very very expansive and packed out with silly amounts of equipment available to purchase depending on your strategy. It has the exact same gigantic feel to it that Farming Simulator does and if you dare to try it on hard as I did you'll find you're really really up against it to keep the slopes in good condition. I'd recommend getting the darker night mod available online somewhere as it really adds to the atmosphere.Do bear in mind you'll be doing a lot of slope grooming so I'd recommend very strongly that you earn enough money early to buy the most expensive slope groomer and Pisten Bully to go with it.Also make sure you pay attention to your strategy as if you buy mixed facilities or fail to arrange things right for your preferred target audience you will not make much money. You can still make plenty from missions but the idea is that you do enough work not to need to eventually.Long nights, busy days, beautiful mountainous sunsets, clearing car parks of snow in a panic, semi-haunting personal quiet moments way up in the hills when a task has just been finished, absolutely wonderful and loads of longevity to it.Ace :)"

This is how long the game held my interest.The game is a unique and original idea, something i have never seen before. First playing the game, i enjoyed grooming the slopes and buying snow plows that actually push around snow! I very much enjoyed these features of the game until i started to look farther into the game.SlopesSlopes require much maintenance from grooming to delievering snow to keep the slopes in good condition. I Love all the different tools and attachments that can be used to care for your slopes. The problem i have with this is core feature of the game is the ability to ""hire a worker."" If you have played GIANTS other popular series, farming simulator, you may ask, ""why is hiring a worker so bad?"" Because you are not really hiring a worker. You pay one flat cost and your slopes are instantly in perfect condition. This has ruined the core featue of the game for me. There is absolutely no point in buying or paying to maintain any equiptment for your slopes when you can have your slopes groomed instantly.Parking Lots/Plows/SaltWell when the core feature of the game has been ruined, there is still caring for your parking lots that no one parks on. Yes, you spend time clearing parking lots of snow that no ai traffic goes through to park, not even magicly appear in a parking spot. Well okay, clearing snow is still sort of fun.. Using snow plows i expected some monster of a plow that pushes away all the snow in its path mush like you see in real life, but in this game all it does is make one small path that would make clearing a parking lot take hours of real life time. Well when plows are horrible at their job what do you turn to? Salt. Salt is nothing special, we see it on the back of all snow plow trucks but in real life, tell me, do you instantly see it destroy all the snow it touches? No? well it does in this game. Salt is extremely overpowered and makes clearing parking lots too easy.In the end, there is no real gameplay that is worth your time and turns this simulator into a micromanagment mini-game."

My thoughts on the game:-It's boring and repetative-The economic system is unbalanced and makes no sense-The managment system seems to have no effect on anything and does not contribute to the success of the resortIn other words: It is the most accurate simulator of anything, ever."

I wasn't expecting much from the game, but I couldn't pass up the deal I was given, so I bought it and I am very glad I did. It is a remake of Farming simulator 2013 to farm skis slopes and invest in a swiss alps ski community. What a enjoyable contrast to most other simulator games I own and consider it one of my top favorites!"

But there really isn't a whole lot to do in this game. Its mostly just grooming the hills, which consists of driving a machine up and down, up and down, and up and down again. This is basically all you do, plus plow some snow once in  a while. Even though it was cheap, I would say its (in my case) $10.99 out the window"

I didn't feel the same way i do when i get a new farming simulator. i just dont have the feeling of fun with ski region simulator. its not worth buying for 9.99. the series has been killed off by giants and probably for a good reason. its not good its not fun and its highly outdated. farming sim 2013 was more updated than this. no hands are visible on steering wheel/handlebar unlike fs13, you cant see your hired workes in ski region sim and you pretty much just do everything on your own. i know in farming sim you do too but i like the feeling that i know that i hired workers and that there actually working i like to see the hired workers i hired. but you cant see them. Just no if you want a game from giants get one of their farming simulator games i suggest farming sim 2017 as they added pigs in it and alot more but i also reconmend farming sim 15."
