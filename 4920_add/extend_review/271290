Not anymore.Hawken was a great game with a small but dedicated fan base. Player counts were starting to pick up, youtubers were starting to review the game, and a strong community loyalty bonded players both to the game and to fellow gamers. Unfortunately while this was happening the publishers of the original devs squandered what money was raised on unnecessary, unasked for merchandise. The devs ran out of money, and Hawken development was discontinued.The game was still fun, but with a floundering playerbase it was difficult to keep it alive. Regardless, with an injection of new players the game could be great once again.Then Hawken was bought. Our beautiful game, purchased by a dev team renowned for grinding up and milking games for money. This is where I hung up my coat, and called quits. Since then, I've been monitoring Hawken in the hope it will once again ascend to it's former glory.And what a naieve hope that was. The game was ported to console edition, but it flopped. The steam community was abandoned, and players have lost money and time they invested to errors- errors ignored and unanswered by the devs. Our game has been abandoned by people who cannot even muster the pretense to care.Hawken, I miss you.Hawken, I love you.Hawken, I loved you."

But the game is, as stated in the requirements not for the most average gamings pc's, i maintain a steady framerate at medium, high is just a little too much for my Gaming laptop, runs on max on my rig no problem.f2p Fairness 10/10(while you certainly can buy items with credits purchase by real currency, the game never feels like it is pay to win, and the gameplay is always fair. pay if you feel like investing into your favorite mech(s) or grind the game and earn it!  all  you can pay for is customization and convenience (battlefield for example, in  bad company 2 allowed you to purchase shortcut packs to different classes, and that is a full retail release (AAA) at that so is it so wrong to pay 5,10, or over 9000! on a game that is certainly worth it and completely outdoes its f2p tag.Controls/Navigation-10/10 i found the controls extremely easy to get used to and all of the default mapping was great for all options, and everything is relatively easy to manage and navigateCommunity 9/10- in my first hours of hawken me and my best friend were eager to learn and the community was certainly helpful on not ony the forums but also in game chat. some minor annoyances occured in game with people complaining of""Hackers"" or ""p2w losers"" but overall i have had a great experience.OVERALL SCORE 9/10 Must Try!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you for reading, i would also like ot note that i installed hawken purely for a quick fix for titanfall, but soon realised that this game might be the king of mech games afterall, it takes mech combat and gameplay and makes it amazing, without the need for any desire to ever leave your mech(why would you, anyways?!)  this was my first full review and i thank anyone who took the time to read it!, i will hopefully build on it in the future with more examples, notes. but for now, back to the game!TLDRHawken is the S#!t.

Then decided to replace things that worked with things that didnt work.In long:I Was great back when its first developer had it in alpha/beta.But has been since sold to the same company that made APB reloaded and is being treated like another trashey free 2 play game.This company could have left most things alone, polished the game up a little bit, then pulled its early access title off and called it good... But they turned it into the same free 2 play garbage that APB reloaded ended up being.If you enjoy the pay to win feeling and the general garbage that most free 2 play games, this is the right game for you.I usually have more inteligent things to say, but I have been dissapointed so hard by Reloaded Studio's previous games and their modifications to this game that I dont even want to waste much more of my time with a good, honest critique.If you wont want to take my word, then download it... its free... the worst that can happen is you waste more of your time here.I can not recomend this game anymore. Even this companies web site doesnt even advertise Hawken, so even they show little respect for this game....To any current and future game developers who might actually read this. Stop/Dont use EARLY ACCESS as an excuse to keep changing around and designing what should be a game deep in development... If you made it to steam, you should be passed the design stage of your game making process. Here is where you go when you are pretty deep into your development stage with maybe less than a year (for large companies) to a year (for small companies/indie) to get your game a little more content and a lot more polish. Upon compleating most if not all of your games polish, remove the early access title from your game. Then just maintain/patch it, add a couple cool things here and there if needed. profit. done.Im sure everyone else is getting sick of these early access games that stay early access for a few years, or even hult development alltogeather after they got the money they needed. Or games that stay early access because they want to redesign something you paid money for because you enjoyed it before they broke it (This game in point)PS. I did throw money into this game back when it was in Alpha/beta back when it was good. That might be some cause for my butt-hurt. Other than seeing such a good game go to♥♥♥♥♥♥"

,Recommended,271290,17067147,"Posted: 15 July, 2015",all,Capt. Satellite Jack,"HAWKEN is a fantastic flurry of metal, carnage, and sheer energy. The game fills a niche place in the market to be sure, but that dosen't mean you shouldn't try it.The Good: GIANT MECHS WITH GIANT GUNS!! Really though, it's Michael Bay the Video Game. Huge mechs duking it out across a bunch of different maps. There's a whole host of mechs to choose from, depending on how you like to play. This game is NOT PAY TO WIN. IT JUST ISN'T. SO STOP SAYING THAT. Everything related to gameplay can be unlocked with in-game credits. Mechs, items, internals, the works. The only thing you have to pay for is swag, like paint jobs and different chassis.The Bad: The previous devs (Adhesive) shut down, and left the game in limbo. Then Reloaded came along and picked this game up from the ashes. This just happened recently, and Adhesive really screwed the game up, so there's gonna long turnaround before the current team can actually release anything new. In the mean time, some balancing needs to happen, but nothing soulcrushing. This game plays like an arena shooter (UT04 for example), where the fast and maneuverable live. Not that this is bad, it just means there's a pretty strong learning curve.The Ugly: Again, Reloaded got the short end of the stick when they got the game from Adhesive, so there's a host of bugs and balances that need to be worked out. There's stuff in the works to be sure, but it may be a while before we actually see any of that happen. The learning curve and grind have also been known to scare people off.TL;DR Big machines, big explosions, big fun. Reloaded is stuck in the mud for the time being, but the game is still super fun. Also, check out the forums athttps://community.playhawken.com/These guys are super cool. Very welcoming and willing to help out a new player in need."

The servers are empty, leaving you without much to do.If I were the game DEVs, I would retire Hawken and just start working on a sequel.

Generally the person who pays the most plays the most and dominates the game. Not so with Hawken, sure your encouraged to upgrade and improve but in general you can go pretty far with the default Mech.  You can play and earn your way to the next level of mech if you so choose to. You also get a chance to test drive or try before you buy the paid mechs.  I have been looking for a replacement for Mech Warrior the old Microsoft game and here we go.  No real story but far much better game play.  This is all multiplay all the time and does it very well. I also stay away from early access as well but this game has had few if any problems.  The changes have come in balance and other areas not in game crashing bugs. Great game great fun and as you can see I have wasted a small portion of my life on it."

Perhaps there'll be a rebirth once it shakes its Early Access status? I hope so. I really, really hope so.My bullsh*t:Real talk, I adore this game. The controls are great (appropriately heavy, but not in that MechWarrior, each leg's a shifting continent sort of way), and the classes are fun and fairly diverse. You've got the fast and fragile pew pew, the mid-sized all-rounders, tanky mash n' blast 'ems, and all of the good ol' FPS tropes in-between. Borderline RPG balancing, honestly (Kombat Technician FTW). The gameplay modes are few, though, as is the map selection, but the gameplay itself is so involving that you don’t really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥when things start looking a bit generic (which, admittedly, happens after the first hour at most. The mechs, combat, and overall ‘spectacle’ are solid, but the environments are passable at best). Regardless of the few flaws and limitations this game was pretty goddamn fun, and while it had a necrotic period with its original developer, I saw a new hope once it was acquired by Renegade, who were laudably active and seemingly interested in expanding the community and revamping the messy bits. Unfortunately, the same story seems to have played out with Developer Dos. Fewer and fewer updates from the devs. No significant updates to the game. Little excitement. Tiny pool of players.

Weapons are not balanced at all. Many are far superior than others which makes the game feel like you are pushed into a specific position. 3. You can end up queued for a match that is practically over, and then, as if that wasn't enough, you get to go through the score screen which wastes even more of your time. 4. None of the mechs feel anymore unique than any other. To top it all off, I'd say most of my time is being spent looking at loading screens, which isn't exactly why I play video games. Overall, I think these need to be addressed before anyone continues to play this game, let alone purchase it. This game could be brilliant, but it let its own beauty get the better of itself."

(I couldn't play titanfall because it kept making me want to play this game)Yes this game is F2P which normally means it's Pay 2 Win. But honestly I was amazed at how little (or none) advantage you get from the upgrades. The only thing that's worth paying for is different mechs as they use different weapons, and if you want to use a different type of weapon, you'll need to fork out to get a different mech, or play the game a stupid amount of hours to earn enough ingame money. (If you want different mechs, or want every thing this game can possibly offer not including skins, buy a bundle, you'll pay once like any other game and have all you want, except skins...)The default mech you recieve for free is perfectly balanced with the other 'medium sized' mechs, there is 3 sizes, light medium and large, all play together and all are supposed to be 'equal' they mostely are but it really depends on how you use them. There is a higher learning curve on the smaller mechs as you have to really make full use of your small agility boost or you'll die in 2 hits, larger mechs allow beginners to be a bit more lazy, especially if you find someone to repair you.If you're a first time player, or not in a light mech make sure you always hang around your team mates! :) or prepare to be frustrated :("

It can stomp. It has two legs to charge (or run away) and it has two arms which are guns! Koo koo cachoo baby! A masterpiece in graphics, sound and especially gameplay and 'feel'.I join a squadron of other mechs and go forth to conquer territory, capture missile silos and struggle to down enemy warships or hold a vital installation. Sometimes it's the straighford business of victory by body count. Sometimes it's  about line breaking, sometimes it's about standing your ground and sometimes it's just about surviving. Plays like a classic Unreal Engine shooter. PVP monster with with the feel of the epic and it boasts a respectable PVE co-op element.Free to play, but NOT pay to win. All mech upgrades can be bought with credits from match money - no boring grind out of proportion to gameplay here. The only things that *require* micropayments are cosmetic, or bundles you can make up one item of a time with your match money (received for every game played).In addition to the quality of gameplay and feeling the phrenetic pandamonium as giant things smash each other to bits, this shooter looks like a graphically intense sim and has loads of development potential.

Seriously, everything is life based.  Hitting someone in the arm, leg or body all has the same damage effect.Limited customization.  Check the website, everything you see there is exactly how it is.  Every mech gets 2 guns, one of which is swappable with a limited number of options (1-2 alternates).Using micro-transactions, you can make any mech look like a different model mech.  This makes battlefield identification pointless.Visual distinction is kind of funny.  You can unlock one alternate model and one camo for each mech.  Everything else must be purchased.  The funny part is that you cannot use the camo on the alternate models.This is not a mech game.  It's a standard fps with jetpacks where your player model happens to be shaped sort of like a mech.Hawken is not a bad game.  I spent $10 to buy into the early entry and played it up to 14 hours a day during a week waiting for a different game to release a new content patch.

So, if you are a gamer that likes to switch classes, you are going to spend time grinding until you unlock enough HC (earned credits) or outright buy MC (purchased credits).  All the upgrades are cool, but they are definitely trying to entice you to skip the grind and paying cash for the game.  Screw that.  I bought into the Nemesis pack thinking that I'd unlock everything like some other games (*cough* Tribes *cough)... essentially paying for a full game to help the devs.  This is NOT the case.  You get a partial game.Example: sucks seeing other players air dodge but you can't because you haven't purchased that particular unlock.  Screw.  That.  Noise.

I am pretty much addicted to playing Hawken and find myself hard pressed to find another game to play that is as fun. I have been playing pretty much every day since Open Beta came out and I love it. The game has evolved and changed so much and yet still stays true. There is nothing like the speed and thrill of running around in an scout (the fastest, least armored mech in the game but hits like a sledge hammer). You can move and fight in ways I have never been able to ever do in any game before.On top of that, the community is amazing. They are all by far the best of any game I have seen. Everyone is willing to help and jump in. Most of the players are kind and have great sportsmanship. There is nothing like getting a GF (Good Fight) after a hard fought battle with someone.If you want lots of action, skill, fast paced, crazy trill FPS game, then Hawken is for you.

While it's cool that these tank-like mechs are all powerful and filled with weaponry, the combat tends to be fairly boring and slow paced compared to regular FPS shooters. With HAWKEN (silly name for this game, imo), the devs have designed some much faster mechs with more agility. Even the slow heavy mechs are fast by normal mech warrior standards. And unlike in traditional mech warrior, the little fast mechs can dish out a ton of damage, and don't have misguided weight class restrictions to prevent a heavy weapons loadout on a fast mech. The lack of armor and survivability is handicap enough.So while the HAWKEN guys have done a good job at giving the game an FPS feel, the game still has the traditional control problems and vision limitations of your typical mech. While some people will be delighted to hear this, I personally would just like to see some kind of GUNDAM anime style mech combat where you can share the instant response controls and high visibility as you would in a normal FPS. As it is, you must rely on your radar to be aware of the battlefield, and depend on your team to cover your blind spots. Great for pre-made squads who intend to play this game competitively, no doubt, but not ideal for solo players running into a team of pre-mades.So in conclusion, HAWKEN takes a mech warrior game to an almost-FPS level, but still keeps some mech handicap traditions alive to make the game still feel like a mech game. Does it succeed at being a good FPS? In my opinion, not really. And does it succeed at being a good mech game? I'd say yes, but mostly because I feel every other mech multiplayer game out there has failed at what it set out to do.HAWKEN gets a 7 on 10 from me, which is a great score for a mech game."

I've been enjoying it more and more the longer time goes on.HAWKEN's long TTK and heavy handling (read: there is a turn rate maximum), positioning and teamwork become even more important than they are in other offerings.  The mechs feel like mechs without feeling incredibly clunky, the weapons feel punchy and satisfying, and there are very few things in the game which are just better than other things.  It's rare for me to find a game wherein I have so much trouble choosing a favorite class/weapon/etc.This game is great.  Play it.  Give it to other people.  It takes a long time to unlock things for free, but they're making its F2P shop better every day, and both mech fans and shooter players will absolutely get their money's worth out of one of the mech-unlocking bundle packs.The newbie mech that you get for free?  I still pilot mine and top charts in it.  The CRT Recruit is loaded with weapons that are easy to pick up and remain potent in the right hands without getting ridiculously overpowered; it's sturdy, relatively quick, and has one of the most potent sustained firefight abilities in the game as well as literally the most flexible main weapon.Play this game.

Many people have simply labeled this game as ""Pay To Win"" but that is SO FAR from the truth. Every item in game and be purchased with both Real World money and HC (In-Game Money) You gain HC quickly enough to be able to freely acquire internal and offensive devices for your mech and ALL of the additional mech can be bought with HC, as well as the tons of cosmetic options (some can only be bought with real money, but there items are ONLY cosmetic)The combat, once you get the hang of it, is extremely fast based and reactionary. You can quickly dodge incoming missiles by sliding either right or left at the perfect moment, you can hover up into the air, and quickly turn your mech 180 degrees if someone catches your unprotected backside. The biggest mechanic that a lot of reviewers seem to be missing is the Dodging / Boosting system. You have to be quick to dodge using your boosters. Read your opponents moves and play strategically while still maintaining twitch reflex shooting. Its very, very intense. Don't treat it like your average FPS, you aren't a humanoid, you are a mech, you have separate advantages and disadvantages, get used to them. Verticality plays a huge role in the gameplay as well. The mechs are agile in a whole different way. But if you try to run and gun like an average FPS, you're toast.There really isn't any other game like Hawken out right now. Its a Mech Sim FPS with an arcade game feel. There are tons of mechs to choose from And each with their distinct advantages and abilities. The game also features a very robust item/ mech upgrade system, much time will be spend configuring the build that suits you best.As far as the F2P model, its rather well designed, if you play smart and play well, procuring ingame credits is a breeze (as is leveling up). If you lack the patience or time, real world currency can be used for unlocks.Did I mention the game looks incredibly stunning? No other game imo right now touts as much polish and detail visually, its remarkable that its F2P.- XeroSyphon"

Here's an in-depth video review with my reasons.http://youtu.be/TvzBWwPvF38In summary, here's some of the pros and cons.+Fun gameplay. You really feel the weight of the mech you're in and all of the feedback.+Large variety of interesting mechs to help you find your playstyle.+Weapons and mechs are mostly balanced. Everything has a strength and weakness attached to it without one being flat-out better than another.+Nothing quite like it anywhere else. It's different from other FPS's because of you being in a mech rather than a person. Lots of interesting situations arise that make the game feel unique and stand out from the rest.-Very grindy. It takes about 8 hours of non-stop gameplay to purchase the most expensive mechs with in-game currency. There are some that are cheaper, but a lot of them come at a high price.-Slightly PTW. You can use real money to buy internals and items that give you an edge in battle. You even can unlock them early only by using real money, as opposed to spending 8-30 hours of playing to unlock the best stuff in the game.-If you are FTP, you ONLY start with one mech. While it isn't any better or worse than the others, it only offers a limited playstyle that may not suit your needs.-No true way to test drive a mech to see if you like it. You're stuck with that mech if you bought and can't get a refund. While there is a feature that grants you unlimited test drives of 1-2 mechs weekly, you're unable to customize it the way you want and are locked with only that. Gambling 8 hours worth of work is too much of a risk to find out if you actually do like the mech you're gonna get.-You feel locked into one particular mech. You accumulate experience with that mech and unlock different loadouts with only that particular one. All the internals and consumables you buy for hefty prices are also locked onto that much only. It feels like it's punishing you for choosing any other mech because you have to start from scratch.-No way to fully customize your mech. One thing that really irks me is that your secondary weapon will always be locked.Overall, I think the game is still worth a play, but I highly recommend you buy the nemesis bundle if you truly want to best experience. Otherwise it's too harsh on FTP'ers."

This game is like taking Tribes 2 and marrying it with Quake 3 Arena while holding some class diversity seen in games like Team Fortress.Pros:+ Mech-based combat.+ Class-based units to choose from.+ Customizable loadout and gear.+ Thoughtfully designed maps.+ Skill-based and fast paced.+ Coop mode included for wave after wave type fighting.+ Enjoyable competitive field.Cons:- Has some F2P elements such as a market.- Doesn't have surround or eyefinity support.

Great mech warfare, fast paced, and strategic!For a free game, you can't get much better than this. There's 4 main multiplayer modes and a co-op ""horde"" mode. The 4 multiplayer modes are deathmatch, team deathmatch, missile assault (essentially king of the hill type style), and seige. Seige is the most unique. You gather energy and go back to your base to deposit it. There is a bar on the top of your team's score that shows how much energy is required to release a giant ship to attack the enemies HQ. Once this giant ship is released, you have to either shoot at it (takes forever) or fight for the anti-air platform somewhere on the map to dispose of it again. Then it starts all over again with energy gathering. Essentially, it's a race to see who returns the most energy and releases the giant spaceships the fastest. Very unique.The mechs cost a lot, and the ""currency"" earning and XP is kind of slow, but I guess they have to make money off of this somehow since it is a free to play since they offer experience and currency boosts for some money. Each mech is unique in its own way, so I would research the mechs to see which ones are worth spending currency on (that way you don't pick a mech and waste all that hard earned currency on something that does not fit your play style.)"

During the 2000's, Chromehounds filled that void but when their servers got shut down, I had nothing for a long time. Hawken brings back the amazing feeling of a mech shooter as well as being familiar to modern shooters that are popular today. I am always skeptical of the free2play model, but Meteor pulls it off right where you can play the game to unlock the mechs, or drop a couple bucks to get what you want earlier.I highly suggest trying this game out, the graphics are breathtaking, controls finely tweaked and it is still only the beta yet it feels like a full game as is.and remember, watch your fuel meter."
,Recommended,271290,32577787,Posted: 19 June,all,Booch,"It's too bad this game is getting some very harsh reviews... there are very few mech combat games out there and HAWKEN is a gem.I put some money into this game a couple years ago before it moved to another developer (505) and thought it was a great game then. My friends then got me into Mechwarrior Online (MWO), so I played that quite a bit. I recently came back to HAWKEN and forgot how fun it really is.MWO is a great game as well, but both games are completely different and, honestly, I'm getting a bit tired of MWO. Really, the only similarity the games share is they involve piloting giant walking robots (which is rad). HAWKEN is much more fast paced and there's no sitting at the screen for several minutes watching other people play before I can pilot again.I don't regret putting money into HAWKEN and certainly may do it in the near future hoping the community for HAWKEN will grow (again). There are some things that HAWKEN does right that I think are just amazing.1. The weapons, for the most part, are very visceral. It feels like they belong on these big machines.2. Each mech is a purpose built machine. The secondary weapon on every mech is hard mounted and cannot be swapped. This may sound like a bad thing, but it's not. The secondary weapon helps define the purpose and role of the mech. For example, I purchase a mech with weapons and abilities designed for long range fighting. Naturally, the secondary weapon has this amazing long range cannon on it. Why would I take it off and put something else there?3. Dirty, rusty, mechanical feel... from the mechs themselves to the maps. Though the graphics aren't top notch, the game looks and feels goodI really hope the community for this game grows. This is one of the best ones out there."

That said though I do have plenty of good reasons for making this a positive  review.This game is excellent for people who like to jump in and play a game without having to put too much time into levelling. In terms of combat, the fighting can get extremely intense! There have been many times in battles that I have found myself either in awe of a pilot's skill or astounded by the the fast paced combat and prolonged fire fights.People occastionally complain about how unfair the fights can be if someone is at maxed out their mech and pilot level, to which I say: Any player at any rank with any mech can beat anyone, provided they have the skill, tactics, or - in the case of myself with a grenade launcher on my mech - a reasonable understanding of grenade bounce physics and detonation timing.If you really want to or don't have the time to manually earn things through levelling and accumulating Hawken Credits - the standard earned currency - you can use real money to buy the specialised in game currency - Meteor Credits.This can be used to do the following:- Gain early access to and purchase otherwise level locked weapons,- Purchase items and internal systems for combat,- As an optional currency to buy or refill consumables,- Purchase new mechs,- Transfer XP between mechs,- Buy cosmetic upgrades- Or simply purchase credit and XP bosters.That said though, unlike a lot of games that utilise micro-transactions, what you can buy with the Meteor Credits will not give you an unfair advantage, and seldom help you win fights if you still don't have the skill to survive.I've played this game for north of 115 hrs and enjoyed it immensely. I hope my long winded review helps and I also I hope to see more people on the battle field soon!TL;DR - Good game with good graphics, people still play it, just check the server region, you'll almost always find people on somewhere."

If you crave for a solid fast paced mech warfare, this is the game you need. The balance between generic FPS and Mech sim, achieved really well. It is not CoD brainless, and also it is not as slow as say MechWarrior Online( which is also a good game). As I played many Gundam and Macross  games on PSP, I feel like this may be it. Sure robot design is pretty unique, and first thing I ever said when I first saw this game  ""gundam, but with mech built from trashcans"". But if you look more closelly, those mech really represent current day tech. You will see communication antenas, cameras, flashlights and other stuff, which is more of a this day tech, than some space tech used in Gundam or MechWarrior. So now I am not complaining about it :)Visuals are a treat for the eyes, even if it is Unreal engine. Also Nvidia owners will experience full quality with PhysX effects on.  Sounds are well recreated, but I wish game would have surround audio. Also controls are tight, and you will feel at home after  few mins in-game.So, should I recommend this game? Hell yeah. Even if Titanfall is behind the corner, this game is not in competition with it. Two different games. Titanfall is still CoD, although a good one, even a a really good one if they keep this up, but it is still CoD, and it will have all the lame CoD community stuff too, like screaming 12 year olds for example. And Hawken is still more of a sim, with atleast slightly mature community."

Oh that's right. Nothing.Even worse, if they actually continue with this game (which i don't think so.) they now have to update 3 versions of it. *smh* not worth your time, honestly. Nothing has changed in the stock pc game.Nov 15 2015: Still waiting for the new developer to deliver. Looks like a patch or two was released, and nothing out of them since then. Looks like hawken won't be coming out of early access. I will retain the 'not recommended' setting for this review, as it still fell pretty short of my expectations.April 5, 2015: i've gotten notice that a new developer has taken over the Hawken project.  I'll wait for an update or two and see if things change for the better. The review past this point is outdated, and I will require a few plays of the new hawken to see what's changed. very hopeful about this.***/updates***Graphics: 7/10 - reasonable. a bit choppy and low effort in some areas.Multiplayer/Network: 9/10 - Glorious connection, rare desynchs, and barely any lag. makes pvp modes really shine.CoOp: 4/10 -unfortunately the modes are limited to two choices (it used to be only one), one of which you cannot join after the game has started, and has a persistent and annoying end-of-round timer. the second choice is a full on human vs AI deathmatch, which helps break up the monotony, but not worth nearly as many points as the long grindy wave-after-wave co op mode.Gameplay: 5/10 - for what it does, it does well, lack of choices and customisation of weapons causes this to have a reduced score. as well as the lack of a singleplayer mode. You don't get to choose your armor or weapons, each mech has its own loadout, and you can only change weapons once you've ranked up or puchased the weapons, a max of three weapon choices per mech, and they're not very inventive. Kind of a huge letdown. Coming from games like mechwarrior, and Chrome Hounds, the ability to not customize your mech is just awful. I loved designing my mech and testing it in combat, until it was perfect. Most engineers will find this game ridiculous.Replayability 2/10 - Really easy to leave this game on a shelf, or just delete altogether. very easy to groan at the sameness of play. The limitation of the game modes apart from pvp is just stifling. Again, the lack of customization also comes into play here.developer support ?/10 - I have no clue when the last update for this game came out, but what I can say is that each update changes very little from the player's perspective. Highly doubt any huge revamp updates coming from these guys. In fact, It's easy to say the game is dead, save for a few hundred players at peak times.And after acquiring this amount of playtime (100+hrs, my profile is on private due to steam spambots), it's very easy to suggest that this is going to be how the game is going to stay, as well as go further and say the game is dead, and gone."

It can feel challenging, especially when playing a good team, but in my experience, I always had at least moderate success, even if it required a change in mech to adjust to the playing style of those I faced.If you're a Mechwarrior fan, it's the multiplayer version of the game Mechwarrior would've been if it had been made in the current era. The mechs can fly well - unlike the original Mechwarrior games - and you're constantly challenged by your own mech's customisation as much as you are by other players.The only other advice I'd give new players, and its vital: STICK WITH YOUR TEAM MATES! You WILL die if you try taking on everyone without them, even in the tank-type mechs. Likewise, read up on your mech before playing. Tactics is vitally important, both in mech customisation and in gameplay.The only other concern to bear in mind - it's Free to Play. That means there's juicy stuff to buy with your credit card. It does not matter. It's tempting - and by all means, support the game if you want to, but it doesn't NEED you to pay to win. You can do as well in a crap, rusty starting mech as you can in a mega-powerful over-the-top mech that costs a fortune. Of course, an over-the-top over-powered mech is a lot of fun, but it's not like they clearly dominate the field unless they are ALSO being used by an extremely well-skilled player, which is why they'll dominate. Powerful mechs just have deep specialisation, and while amazing in those areas, the right methods can always bring them down.Brilliant work by the developers, and a pleasant challenge to Titanfall, though I didn't think I'd say it - watch them with care.

Stick together - teamwork wins games.CUSTOMIZATION: After you take a break from the battles, it's fun to customize your mech with camouflage and try out various internal upgrades and deployables.  All of the customizations that make your mech look totally awesome cost money of course, but they don't affect the game play.UNIQUENESS: Because the mechs are so nimble, Hawken is more like an FPS than a standard Mech game.  Even so, Hawken differs from many FPS in that every Mech carries two weapons that are available simultaneously - like akimbo in a typical FPS, but with different weapons in each hand.  Imagine an automatic in your left hand, and an RPG in your right hand.  Then add 1-3 deployable items such as turrets, explosives, radar, etc.CLASSES: There are three classes of mechs: Light (A), medium (B), and heavy (C).  The lighter mechs are fast and maneuverable, but fragile.  The B class are a good balance of mobility and firepower.  The (C) class mechs can reconfigure themselves into a slow-moving mobile fortresses.  Within the (A) and (B) classes, there are sniper-mechs, stealth mechs, and assault mechs.  There is even an (A) class repair mech - you can be sure to find a mech that suits you, but new pilots should probably stick with the (B) class initially.FTP: It is FTP, so  plan to spend some cash buying upgrades or package deals - the developers didn't get paid when you downloaded the game, right?  You start with a B-class assault mech - some of the new players complain about it, but the veterans sometimes switch back to this mech just to prove that the problem is the pilot, not the mech.  WIth the right upgrade (the prestige weapon) and some decent internals your B-class assault mech can hold its own - you can read on the Hawken forums for recommendations and even key configurations that players use to improve their game.SUPPORT: The best part of this game is that it's still getting better.  The developers are still adding more mechs.  The latest patch balanced the mechs better, fixed some gliches in the maps, and added another game mode.  Give it a try, but remember to stay with the pack."

The only down sight I find is that its main focus is only on multiplayer, with no focus on single player.

,Recommended,271290,9657530,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,Eggmayonaise,"HAWKEN is a wonderful multiplayer game that emulates the feel of stomping around in a combat mech. Succesfully piloting your mech will take a lot of skill- preventing yourself from overheating, dodging and taking evasive action, and knowing the strengths and weaknesses of both your and your opponent's mechs are all key to victory. The graphics are incredible, the gameplay is visceral and oh-so rewarding, the audio really makes you feel like bullets are pinging off your hull as you stomp towards your enemy, minigun spinning up and rocket launcher flinging its payload at said opponent.Yes, microtransactions ARE part of the game, but, barring cosmetic items, there is almost nothing you can buy with real money that can't be earned in the game, and the starting mech (though unimpressive in appearence) is remarkably well-rounded and balanced. The mechs are varied and useful only for certain situations- spending money to instantly buy the biggest mech in the game and unlock all its weapons immediately won't help you win. Knowing the strengths of your mech and its weapons, and how to use them against the enemy, is what will make you do well in HAWKEN.I do spend money on this game, but what money you put in will be well-spent. Mechs (in the in-game currency to buy them outright) are roughly $10, and another $5-$10 will take you far in terms of customization. You can also buy some of the various bundles here, which will serve you well as a place to start off from."

I have played over 30 hours on it, and even though there's no campaign, it is very satisfying. Granted, since it is all online, there will be times where you are literally dominated by longtime veterins of this game even from before it was on Steam. But the gameplay allows you to level up, which gets you better equipment, which helps you out on the battle field. All that said, this game is still in developement, so even though there aren't as many maps as other online games, more are coming.Since its a mech shooter, it comes with a variety of mechs, from light-weight, to mid-weight, to heavy-weight. Of course, the light-weight mechs are faster but with less armor and damage output, but speed is essential in fire-fights. The mid-weight mechs are more of an all purpose machine. Then the heavies are slower but pack bigger punches.Currently there are 6 game modes; team deathmatch, deathmatch, missile assult, siege, and a co-op bot destruction where you work together to fight the 25 waves of robots.This game has beautiful graphics and I don't even use the max video settings. I highly recomend a good internet connection since it is an online game, and the skills to work with a team (unless you're in deathmatch, because that's just a free-for-all)."

Gritty fast and raw battles, amazing visuals, and a combat system that is much more dependant on skill than your wallet.If you loved the old Mechwarrior I and II games, fire this up.The only big negative with Hawken so far is that it wants to ""double-dip"" players on the standard Bonus Exp , Bonus Credits monthly modifiers.  Unlike most (MW, World of Tanks, etc)  Hawken wants you to buy both exp and credit bonuses seperately. There is no ""monthly"" gold membership type option.  If you want EXP and Credit bonuses for a month get ready to pay 30 or 40 bucks for it.You can still play it F2P but the speed at which you get exp and money in this game is insanely slow, much worse than most f2p games. Also, Items and Internals are not interchangable; if you spend a week griding to buy a droppable machine gun turret for your sniper mech your going to have to spend another week grinding to get the same turret for your brawler. This REALLY puts the pressure on you to dish out $$$$$$.So overall a great game, but the F2P setup puts the screws to players a little too aggressively imho.  At least make it so we can get monthly bonuses for a reasonable 15$ a month or something. $30+ just for the bonuses is pretty damn greedy."

Anything cosmetic will cost you some $$ but its well worth it to make your mech yours.  Given that the game will be eventually free to play, I have purchased starter packs and items to support the devs for making a great game.Matches are fairly even for the most part but sometimes the matchmaking fails and pits you against players that are more experienced but I dont mind as much as that will help you get better.

,Recommended,271290,9300952,"Posted: 28 February, 2014",all,Cosmic Isle,"This is a great game.  The visuals, sound and gameplay are all excellent.  The mech designs are striking and unique.  There are a lot of mechs to try, all with their own strengths weaknesses and playstyles.  There is a lot of room for customization.  The matchmaking is usually excellent with many close battles making for some intense matches.The mechs all feel great, clunking around in them is very satisfying.  Movement has weight to it and there is a definite sense of mass when piloting the mechs.  There are a lot of great details.  Bumping into walls produces sounds of metal grinding.  Streelights and debris are either crushed or knocked aside when you collide with them.  The cockpit is well detailed, the viewscreens flicker with static, the instruments all make sounds.  The floating hud hurts the immersion but it does make keeping track of your health and fuel easier.  All the weapons make fantastic sounds and the overall sound design is beyond excellent.  Shooting feels great and the movement mechanics will make for some furious skirmishes.  This is not a mech sim, do not expect Mechwarrior, this is more like an arena shooter with mechs.  The movement evokes the feel of japanese style of mech games, or say the newest unreal tournament or COD:Advanced Warfare.  There will be a lot of boosting, dashing and dodging.  Learning how to chain all that together efficiently while still aiming and firing at your opponent is key to victory.  Twitchy yet tactical.Most importantly is that the developer is doing free to play right, every item that affects gameplay can be acquired just from grinding.  It can be a long grind but you are still given a fair amount of credits after every match.  A few hours will yeild enough HC to outfit a mech with internals and items.  There is no pay to win at all, plenty of people can dominate using the starter mech.  Cosmetic items all cost money but some will unlock just by leveling pilots or mechs.  I've heard it compared to the League of Legends F2P model and that sounds about right.  If you don't want to grind you can also unlock things early.  There do not seem to be any mechs or weapons that are straight upgrades though, the game is well balanced.  The developer has invested a lot of time into this game and it shows, it has grown a lot since the alpha and the finished product is polished and well thought out.Great game, good F2P, worth throwing some money at and definitely worth the install.  If you like mechs and giant robots you will enjoy this game."

The digital tech theme is very well done and fits the genre perfectly.The payment scheme is a lot like League Of Legends which allows players to unlock items with real money Meteor Credits [MC] or HAWKEN Credits [HC] which are earned by playing the game.Lastly, HAWKEN is more of an action game with mechs.

Thought the free to play model was gonna be a bust, but so far so good. All mechs can be purchsed with in game currency, but require serious grind to accumulate the necessary amount of credits to purchase the expensive equipment. All items can be purchased by credits, except for cosmetics which require real money. If you don't wanna bother with the grind, you can buy any of the equipment or mechs with real money, as well. The visuals look stunning (especially the flight pattern of rockets followed by explosions XD). There are certainly areas in need of improvements, such as matchmaking and mech balance.

,Recommended,271290,9764629,"Posted: 8 April, 2014",all,C413B,"I downloaded this game on the assumption that it was some sort of bird simulation MMO, but sadly, the title is misleading. Instead, I found myself in heated mech-on-mech battles, complete with gunfire, explosions, and a few people who spent way too much money in microtransactions to deck out their mechs. (but luckily, there weren't many people like that)The combat was fast-paced and interesting, although my one complaint is that you don't seem to have much health. (you can repair yourself quite easily during battle, so that makes up for it a bit)The game runs on the Unreal engine, so it looks good and most people with half-decent computers can run it easily.Most of the things you have to pay real money for are cosmetic, so it isn't that bad. However, I believe that there are a few mechs you can only buy through microtransactions, but hardly anybody uses them, and they're still well balanced.While this game has nothing to do with birds, (I have no idea from where they drew the title), it is still a satisfying and fun game that I would highly recommend to any mecha/fps/Michael Bay fans out there. 7.9/10Okay, let's be honest. I knew it had nothing to do with birds. Do they even make bird-related MMOs?

,Recommended,271290,9151819,"Posted: 17 February, 2014",all,BDA,"HAWKEN is a very fun, arcadey robot shoot-em-up. There are a surprising number of interesting game modes (though not as many maps as I'd like to see, at this point in development), and a fair number of neat robots, weaponry, and abilities. Gameplay is simple arena-style for the most part, with plenty of explosions and bullets whizzing about, and with the unique abilities of different mechs adding a bit of variety for different playstyles. Overall, it's fun and engaging, if a bit simple.I do have some pretty noteable criticisms, though. The grind is extreme, if you haven't bought the starter bundle (which is a pretty fair value, all in all). Unlocking new weapons and robots takes a very long time, and cosmetics are cash-only. There's also not much in the way of non-cosmetic customization. Each mech has one special ability, one non-unique secondary weapon that can't be changed, and a choice of three non-unique primary weapons (that need to be unlocked through grinding or real-money). This feels a bit arbitrary. It makes me wonder why they didn't actually let you BUILD your mech, by choosing from a wide variety of parts, abilities, and weaponry. The only customization to speak of is choosing which of your selected robot's three primary weapons you'd like to roll out with, after grinding to unlock one of a rather uninspired collection of cookie-cutter prebuilds.I'd recommend the game, because it really is fun. The core gameplay is there! But it's not a very high recommendation, because of the huge amount of missed potential with the gimpy customization system. I'd give Hawken a 3/5 in its current state, but changing simply changing the customization system to one that let you actually assemble your very own mech would make me reconsider that rating in a big way."

What it does is bring back some small memories of the Mech Warrior and Battle Tek era. The graphics are top nodge, the sound is just as good and the gameplay is smooth and fast. And that IS its major flaw. The combat is fast and hectic. Not good for this kind of genre. If I want a fast mecha game, than I gonna play a game based on Pat Labor, Ghost in the Shell, Front Mission Evolved or something like Full Metal Panic. Get the idea? I'm piloting a mega tonage heavy behemoth of destruction with serious cooling problems; so I want the feel with this deal. Combat should be dangerous, stalking, waiting, striking like. Right now it's not more than Unreal Tournament with beep beep robots where the unlocks are used to keep players bound to the game. And that's another flaw. The unlocks are not attractive and there's hardly any ""real"" Mech Warrior / Front Mission Evolved garage option.Can it be fun?Yes and no, the game is fun as long as you play with some friends, but only for 20 minutes or so. because the major matches are nothing more than kill the enemy.

You will invest a lot of time into a mech to unlock all it's features only to discover there's a mech recently released that does basically the same thing but better.The game gets boring because the best strategy is to take as little risk as possible. Because it takes so long to even kill one mech by yourself you must travel in a huge pack (6v6) and hope for the best. Unfortunately, there are Technician mechs which heal you for points and every mech already can heal itself in safety so the end result is constant run and hide without killing. To add even more to the problem, each killed mech leaves behind health for you to collect. It just ends up being too campy with repair mechs behind you and only medium and heavy mechs can take somewhat of a risk for a flank attack.The game is poorly balanced at this point with its gameplay and mech classes. The risk/reward ratio is greatly out of proportion. It's a shame since the game looks pretty good for a ""FTP"" model."

It WILL take sometime to try out each mech thoroughly and pick between those you work with best. (My personal line-up is the Technician, the Rocketeer, and the Predator). Once you finally figure out which mechs you are compatible with, try using them in different ways. Whether its being a lonewolf, hopping on the team wagon, or simply sticking with a specific team member- im sure you'll find some good results in the aftermath of the battle. The game consists of very few bugs so far, and constant tweeks are being made to increase in-game balancing and performance. Also, new mechs are added to the game every few updates are on constant watch to get their fair-share of tweeks and battle adjustments so no mech seems overpowered. Sometimes though, you may get a player or two who think you fight a little TOO well and may call you a hacker. As far as i've noticed. these ""Hackers"" are really just experienced players who found thier perfect match with a very specific mech and knows when and when not to fight. Tips for those who get this game: Try your best to stay on the ground; Never stand still in a fight; Never run from a battle when close to death or it'll be easier for the enemy to shoot you in the back and finish you off. Goodluck to you guys who get the game."

You do die that quick. You could be in a the heaviest mech and be shredded by a light or medium in one and a half seconds. If that is what you want out of a mech game then I'm sure this is the game for you. I just think that most people who want to play mech games want the matches to be slug fests. Sure the mechs themselves could move fast and there is nothing wrong with that but there is really no way to survive being jumped in this game. Skill won't help and your equipment won't either.I really wish I would have had a chance to play the game before the devs made all of the changes. Lights should be lights and all that encompasses same with heavies. It just seems meaningless in this game except for movement speed.
76561198005403195,Not Recommended,271290,9230117,"Posted: 23 February, 2014",all,Leifanator,"TLDR: This is more of a shooter than a mech game, the gameplay is fun enough but nothing to go crazy over, it's free to play model seems to be reasonably fair but a bit on the grindy side (which is to be expected really), and the prices range from understandable to a bit too expensive.I wish there was a third option for the ""Do you recommend this game"" buttons, like ""Maybe"" or ""Undecided"".Firstly, at the time of writting this, Hawken is early access and if you want to play you need to pay. Later on it's been said it will be fully free to play once it's fully released.Secondly, I would highly recommend waiting until you can play for free before putting any money towards it so you can have a clear picture on how the game works/plays first.So, what have I experienced so far? Well, I've found that Hawken plays more like a shooter than a mech game and this is the crux of the issue some people may have with it as how the game is played determines how well people will enjoy it especially if they were expecting one and not the other.Ok so, games like Armored Core or Mech Warrior are ""mech"" definitive games. These games let you customize your gaint stompy robot with a plethora of parts (things like changing your engine to affect your speed or increasing the amount of armor on your mech). The main component with these games and ones similar, is that every part on your mech has a disadvantage and an advantage (like taking extra ammo for your big gun instead of adding more armor).Enter Hawken, the mechs/robots can only be customized in what they can bring with them to a fight and no changes can be made on how they perform. Hawken has a class system for their mechs, each one does something different and has different weapons and different abilities. Sure you can load up your mech with a bunch of defensive items, but these feel more like traits you'd pick rather than a custom built mech. Each and every mech has unlimited ammo, each and every mech has only two weapons, each has a special ability that is activated and has a cooldown before it can be used again.If you like shooters, Hawken will be to your taste. But do not go into it expecting to fully strip out your mech and rebuild it from the legs up with a bunch of parts. You can change the way how your mech looks of course, but there is no function or stats associated with those changes.As a shooter, it's solid, the game modes are fun (if a little uninspired) with death match, team death match, king of the hill, and a coop against AI mode. The shooting is a little boring as I've only seen one laser like weapon with the rest being ballistic type weapons. The mechs themselves range from unique looking to just plain uninteresting and I would imagine this was done on purpose to try to get people to purchase cosmetics.Which brings me to the final point, it's free to play model. From what I can see, everything can be purchased with money, weapons, skins, items/internals (traits). Now the game feels balanced enough that this doesn't seem like an issue as the only thing you can't seem to get with the ingame currency are the cosmetic stuff. However, if you don't spend money you will need to play for a fair amount of time before you can fully kit out the way you want to. The prices seem to range from fair to slightly too expensive on everything at the moment.All in all, Hawken is a game to wait for it to become fully free to play as I can't recommend to put money down on it at the moment or maybe at all. It just doesn't do enough to draw me in as it is at the moment as it just feels like another shooter with robots instead of people. That said though, I was looking for a mech game where I could fully customize how the mechs performed so I am SLIGHTLY biased in that regard."

I am not a some kind of hater, no. Just love mecha games and try Hawken. No one promised me hardcore gaming that I expect, so theres no blame on game itself. Just write a couple of words for those old fans of battletech and armored core."

It makes me not even want to play video games anymore especially online MMOS.Do not support this game financially.

In this regard it does extremely well. It's got all the features of a fun first person shooter, and includes the fairly standard unlocks-by-level design to keep you playing.You'll like this game if: You just cant get enough mech action, and think that getting out to run is for cowards.

The variety of mechs you can buy are all very interesting and fun to play.

,Recommended,271290,9116595,"Posted: 15 February, 2014",all,Lethal Onomatopoeia,"Gameplay - 8/10Desperately needs more maps, and the ones recently added seem to be slipping in quality compared to the older ones (what the hell is going on with Bunker, seriously). The core game itself is really super fun, however, and strategic play, coordination, positioning, and map control play a refreshingly important role. The Air Compressor internal could certainly stand some heavy nerfing, or almost every other internal item needs to be heavily improved to match its level of game impact. Most high level players recommend equipping Air Compressor on ALMOST EVERY SINGLE MECH IN THE GAME (exhibit A)https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al62eM1sHTQ-dGRSWjdzaURENGdZa2FxelF6U2Vkdmc&usp=drive_web#gid=0and if that's not a huge red flag that the item is way too strong then I don't know what could be. Sadly, don't expect it to be balanced any time soon, as the item requires you to be a fairly high level to unlock it, unless, of course, you spend real money (which is probably the idea behind the strength of the item).While versus multiplayer is definitely the strongest focus of HAWKEN, there is a cooperative mode that, while unrefined and definitely tilted strongly towards certain mechs and against others, is still decently fun.Networking/Servers - 3/10Solo matchmaking play works ok, but this is a game that could really, REALLY, stand to have dedicated servers. And god forbid you actually want to play with your friends. You'll have to jump through dozens of hoops, your party will need to be a specific size, if somebody's MMR is too skewed they can't play with you AT ALL, etc. It really sucks.Graphics - 9/10This game is very good looking. The maps are all very beautiful, now we just need a larger variety of them in higher gameplay quality than recent additions Last Eco and Bunker. Also extra points for the ""boot checks"" that play across your mech's HUD when you load into a game. I think its a really nice touch that, while small, adds a lot of atmosphere to the game.Sound - 8/10Surprisingly good, if limited music. Other sounds are pretty good.F2P Model - 1/10This game is apparently valued at half a thousand dollars. Spent $50 on a game I think is fun and still feel like I got pretty heavily tricked and ripped off. Good unlocks are hidden at high ranks to pressure players into spending real money. I can't believe that back when TF2 went Free-to-Play I thought that the F2P scheme was going to be one of the best things to happen to gaming. It's like when anybody considers a free to play system their pupils turn into dollar signs and reason is abruptly thrown out the window. All cosmetics and mech parts have to be purchased once PER MECH, despite being the exact same thing. Many of them, especially the ones accessible to low level pilots, who do not start out with starting items in order to make them feel pressured to buy something to fill up those empty upgrade spaces, are blatantly underpowered garbage designed to drain players' HC (in-game currency that is EXTREMELY time-consuming to grind) funds to entice them to buy Meteor Credits (buy-with-real-money but obscured bogus value credits to hide how much money a player is actually spending) later on, before the player really knows how useless the things they're buying are. If you see a F2P game that uses this kind of currency, you can bet your♥♥♥♥♥they chose to use monopoly money values instead of real-life currency prices because everything in their store is vastly overpriced and they know it. Parts cannot be sold or traded in any way (of course) once a player realizes they were a waste.This is all a real shame since I would have been totally ready to spend well over $50 on cosmetics, new mechs, etc if I felt the pricing was fair or generous, the game would have been more fun and balanced if you could choose all internals and active items right off the bat, and now I regret spending so much and am very leery about making another ""micro""-transaction on this game.What I'd consider a fair deal is $60, maybe even up to $70 for every mech, internal, and active item currently in the game (I wouldn't even expect to get future-released items for free after this), not even including nice cosmetic items. I'd be willing to pay EVEN MORE ON TOP OF THAT for cosmetics. Holy hash browns, they'd get more money from one customer than Respawn Entertainment is going to make from one sale of Titanfall. According to the Meteor Entertainment, however, a package that allows you to actually ""own the game"" like that would be worth more than $500. Are you kidding me? How greedy can you get? How many other games have you spent $500 on? The pricing is an awful deal at best and abusive and scammy at worst. They did trick me out of my $50 to unlock a little more than half of the mechs and have a little bit left over to be wasted on a couple of their other super-overpriced transactions, though, and I guess that's good enough for them.In the end, HAWKEN is a great game, but has unfortunately succumbed to ""super F2P greed syndrome"" that squanders a large amount of potential and makes it much more difficult to get into than if you were simply able to ""buy the game"" in a bulk transaction. I think Meteor bit off more than they could chew, so to speak, and that in the long run the game's overzealous pay system is going to weigh down the game, which is really unfair to the folks at Adhesive who put lots of good work into it."

Think a little more Armored Core, a little less Mechwarrior.The Good:Environments:  Best world design of any game in its class. If nothing else, download it just to see the levels. In cities, Bladerunner meets Dubai. Gameplay-wise, the maps are challenging to learn but provide a lot of different approaches.Gameplay: Not everyone in the community agrees, but I like the fast fights with little respawn time. You can snatch victory with a well organized last minute push. Likewise, you can't get too comfortable with a strong lead - you have to work to keep it. Seiges are the exception to the rule, and can seemingly last forever. Still a unique & enjoyable gameplay mode though.Immersion: AAA polish when it comes to the mech interiors, the splash pages, the garage and the HUD. Loving attention is paid to little details, like wondering if your clunky old CRT mech will pass all of its pre-flight checks.The Not-So-Good:Let me start by saying that anything you need to win can be unlocked by playing (Game Currency, or Hawken Points, are free and accumulate as you play). There is no pay to win, although you can certainly get a head start by spending some cash to unlock gameplay essentials early. Nothing uncommon there.That said, paint jobs, cosmetics, and customizations are mostly Paid-currency only. I wouldn't mind, but each customization has to be purchased separately for each mech. Think buying hats for your toons in Team Fortress, but you have to buy them separately for each class. Considering that, I don't think the Paid Currency, Meteor Points, are a good value right now. But the Nemesis pack is pretty good if you can get it and want a head start. Unlocks most mechs with enough left over to trick one or two of them out.Also the physx and the open nature of some maps have been scaled back since beta. Sad, but necessary to get reasonable frame rates I suppose. There is still enough complexity to keep the maps interesting. Hopefully they will be able to take some of the forcefield ""bumpers"" out in the future though.Overall, highly recommended that you try Hawken if you are a mech fan, or if you enjoy FPS and are just looking for something different."

The controls are fluid, polished, and the gameplay is release-ready.If you're a hardcore robot jockey that was disappointed by mechwarrior online, Hawken is the game for you to play, it has enough robot action to satisfy your nostalgia for old school sci-fi sims and enough mainstream twitch-skill FPS appeal to keep competition healthy.You can theoretically buy everything in the cash shop, but the game is not pay to win. Only paints, emotes, skins, and all the customization stuff that has no effect in combat is cash only. Everything else can be earned grinding, and each individual mech only has so many options. Most of the most powerful weapons in the game are skillshots and a competent noobie can smoke a wallet warrior.The real skill cap in the game comes from mastering mech control, because the robots do actually have movement profiles and 90% of fights are won through maneuver and strategic positioning, even in a noob mech vs someone who bought/grinded and unlocked an advanced mech.As of this review, the only way new players get into Hawken is by purchasing the Nemesis package and unloading $30 on the game, which is a hefty pricetag for what you can get on Steam if you just wait for the right sale. The Nemesis bundle unlocks roughly half the mechs in the game, from every assorted playstyle, their optional sidegrade weapons, and gives you enough cash shop funds to buy paint or parts for the ones you actually like and play after you try them out.If you enjoy the game and actually like it, you will not regret a penny of the Nemesis package, just for the amount of time and effort it will save you grinding to find the mech that suits your playstyle."

Ignore the 'early access' thing, it's release quality.Well put together game - graphics are pretty good (it's Unreal Engine, with Unreal'esk graphics) - runs well and gameplay is pretty smooth. It's a kind of mix between one of the original Mech Warrior games and UT3. A little clunky at first for a new player as the maps are actually quite complex, but once you get the hang of it, it's much easier to navigate your way around.The mechs aren't quite Mech Warrior style - you can't customise them from the chassis up, there are 3 classes - light, medium, heavy - and then mech types for each class. Each type has a fixed secondary weapon and special ability. You get a choice of 3 primary weapons and you can custimise your 'internals' (small buffs) and what 'items' you take. Items are anything from shields, area denial, sensors/jammers, bombs, etc. This combined with the more complex level design adds great balance and startegy to the game. You'll find yourself dying less (giant mechs take a bit of beating and you can repair) and needing to work together as a team more (staying together in a group is essential).There is some micro-purchasing in the game.. it doesn't impact the game very much though - it helps you expedite the path to getting your small buffs - instead of waiting till you level up enough (Call of Duty style unlocks) - you can just buy the buff. Other than that, the micropurchasing just unlocks cosmetics, etc.Lots of fun, nice well put toghether game for anyone who enjoys the old Mech Warrior games, or Unreal style FPS'."

I played Mechwarrior Online for quite a while and discovered that it was just a bit to serious for me. I saw HAWKEN quite a while back when it was announced and thought ""Oh gee look at this, a mechwarrior clone."" I was so incredibly wrong! HAWKEN doesnt try to be overly-realistic, instead offers you a mix of strategy and fast paced shooting. You must choose your fights very wisely based off of what mech you are in, but when the heat of battle does start it starts fast.The boosting mechanic in the game adds this insane yet very skillful art to the game. Dodging a missle at the last second only to give your enemies a face full of your own is just so rewarding. It also allows for very cool level design as the tops of buildings are very accessable by almost all mech classes.Honestly, a good comparison for this game is League of Legends. HAWKEN treats mech almost the exact same way that League treats champions. Except, I do think that the start of the game could offer a bit more than 1 so so mech and 1 free week mech. Earning the cash for mechs is quite painless since the gameplay behind HAWKEN is just so damn fun!If you like giant mech games, and fast paced tactical shooters this game is definately for you."

76561198002435939,Recommended,271290,9095834,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,SpecOp Clergy,"Hawken in currently the best mech-based game out there at the moment.  Sure, there is another F2P mech game out there trading on its famous IP, but when it comes to fun over mere lore, nothing beats Hawken.  It looks great and, even more importantly, plays great, largely due to devs who take the crituques of the community seriously.  I have been playing Hawken since the game went into open beta about one year ago (!), and have largely enjoyed every minute of it (there was one or two expansions that were a bit messy, but Adhesive was quick to fix whatever was broken).Now, it needs to be pointed out that the mechs in Hawken aren't the slow, stompy kind, but rather something quicker - more like a jet with legs than a tank with legs.  As a result, combat is much faster in this game than in a traditional mech game were victory is often a matter of slowly attriting your foe's armor.  Instead, combat is more like a dogfight on the ground where snap decisions and smart weapon choice seperates the victor from the loser (Hawken mechs can have three weapons: a primary, a secondary, and a special ability that can also be a weapon).This game is also a looker.  The maps all have a lived-in style to them that greatly helps with immersion, particularly those maps with destructible terrain (trucks that can be kicked, lamp posts that can be toppled) that really brings home the fact that you are piloting a big war machine.  The mechs themselves are nicely designed, particularly the cockpit overlay that really gives a sense of motion.  Combat effects are a bit rudimentary - sadly, mechs cannot currently be dismembered bit by bit - but convey sufficient feedback to make battles fun.Hawken even offers you different modes of play (five or so), from the ever popular deathmatch, to the new (and fun) co-op mode where it is your team of mechs versus a rampaging army of AI-controlled mechs and bots.  Great fun!I really cannot say enough good things about this F2P game.  Oh, speaking of which: this is definitely NOT a pay-2-win game.  Everything in the game can be unlocked with ingame credits with the exception of cosemetics (camo, vanity thrusters, etc.).  I would even say this game reminds me of World of Tanks in the sense that you can spend so many hours playing this game enjoyably without spending a dime that you start to feel guilty and eventually just buy $5 or $10 dollars worth of currency out of guilt!I think with its forthcoming Steam launch, the future for Hawken in very bright.  The devs have a proven trackrecord of listening to feedback, not to mention rolling out regular updates with new maps and mechs.  Hawken is highly recommended by me!PS:  The game even has an interesting backstory.  I recommend you check out the three free short graphic novels, along with the full length graphic novel ""Genesis"" for a proper grounding in all things Hawken.  Now if they will just give us that live action web series...."

The Beta as of now didn't have asingle player but I don't think that is coming. There is  5 Modes TDM, DM, Missle Assault, Siege and Co-op Bot Destruction; This isn't including the VR training which is the only single player mode. The first thing you will notice is that the mechs have real weight on them. The maps themselfs are really nice looking and all have different flows making team work important (some A-holes will ignore that fact). If you are a new player the Nemesis pack is really hell of a deal. If your like me and are a existing player then the pack will miss you all up. The main problem is that it will give you more mechs and if you already have that mech you now with doubles and the double has the awesome chassis.... Even worst is there is no selling mechs or scrapping mechs at this time... So my rank 3 Bruiser has a twin brother that is new born but with better chassis and good start sidearm (WTF Hawken!)

All said, there aren't a lot of weapons choices. However, there are plenty of items and equipment to ""tweek"" your mech to your style of play which can help quite a bit.

Tachincally still early access, so there are a few bugs here and there, mostly just bldgs you should be able to land on but can't. It is pretty much 100% playable.Is this pay-to-win? Yes and No. Theoretically you can grind enough to buy upgrades and new mechs. Realistically, though, the earning scale for in-game currency is way too low, and therefore way too slow. Levelling doe snothing for you but unlock the potential to buy stuff you will probably never be able to afford. However, you can purchase Meteor Credit soutside of the game, and buy everything offered at a lower price than the in-game currency, and you can buy it before you have unlocked it.I appreciate the game devs need to get paid. So the concept of a completely free-to-play game is kind of a myth, or at least a misnomer. It is worth buying maybe 3600 meteor credits ($10) and buying three mechs with it. It's jsut enough to do that. Get yourself a light fast mech (I recommend the Scout), a mid-range mech like a predator or soemthign with 300+ armor, and a good heavy, 600+ armor mech. Then you cna grind for the in-game currency to buy parts.Another annoying thing is that you can buy any cosmetics with in-game currency, only meteor credits. I'm not sure whose bonehead idea that was, but if painting your mech purple is really important to you, then it's going to cost cash. I can't imagine anyone but the rich brats wasting money on soemthing that does nothing for in-game performance. I think the devs just did that so they could say its free-to-play and any out-of-game costs are mostly for aesthetics. Really stupid plan on the devs part.I recommend this game because this is pretty much a Mech Warrior/Battletech clone. It's a shame FASA went belly up, because Mech Warrior, being over ten years older than this now I think, is actually a superior game to Hawken. Hawekn's has better, up-to-date graphics, but as far as gameplay goes doesn't even begin to rival that old dinosaur of a game. That being said, no one is playing Mech Warrior anymore, so for those Mech-junkies out there like me, this is what we get. I certainly can't argue against a price of ""free"" for the game, it's worth playing just for that. However, if you want to actually compete with the rich kids, then it's going to cost you. Frankly I would rather just pay $40 and earn everything through grinding, like most shooters these days. Cosmetics shoudl be awarded for levelling, not for cash, and power ups should be staged throughout leves more appropriately, then the battles you can participate in determined by your level. As it stands now, the richest kid will probably dominate, and you can always tell who they are right away because their mech will be purple and black  all over."

Used to play Q3, UT, CS earlier, but these days don't playing online much.But Hawken is really addictive ;o) Fast mech battles where team playing is the key. You can buy stuffs, upgrade to maximum, but it's useless with non-cooperating team. Playing with your teammates is the key, no matter of upgrades etc. Just wait a few rounds for a good balance and then it's a lot of fun. I like the tactical part of the game and upgrades too. For example oponent turned on the shield and I used cool-down to my busrt weapon and finished him with his barier :) And smartly using repair drones or better to have a good techs around is a win ;o) Just don't go for lonely journeys and stick to your team god dammit! ;o)"

Quite simply HAWKEN was a game I was always keeping my eye on before it came out and I never got a chance to get it.  With the recent Steam pack I suggest the $9.99 pack and you’ll be off to a good start.  As soon as you hop on the game you will have to create an account and do some basic training before you go online.  Surprisingly the training makes you feel like you’re a pilot learning how to use a mech and it’s not as tedious as you think…it actually puts you in the mood.  Now once you enter your first Team Deathmatch you will be blown away by how fluid it is and how beautiful it looks even for low computers!!  To me it’s a mixture of Unreal Tournament, Strike Vector, Counter-Strike, and Mech Warrior.  It’s like they put all the best elements of our favourite games and synthesized it into one package.Now if you are worried about this game being PAY-TO-WIN have no fear as it is only the cosmetics of your MECH that you buy.  Yes you can unlock certain things early but you can earn them with in game experience and levelling.  My only gripe with the game as of now and it’s nothing major is that I’ve been noticing problems with the MIC support.  Sometimes it comes out choppy even if one has a fairly good microphone.  I’m sure the developers are well aware of this and are making plans to fix it.  So if you have a team of friends I suggest you use SKYPE for now.Lastly, I just want to say that the community is great and really helpful to new-coming players which is very surprising!  I think the game is just so damn fun that people don’t want to fight/heckle after a match.  Hopefully it will stay like this.  A USEFUL TIP:  Always stick together with your team and never go lone-wolf unless you’re sure you can push and make the kill!  I’ll see you on the other side in Illal!!!"

For starters, I have dedicated endless houes into Mechwarrior Online and have always enjoyed the level of simulation and tactics involved in that game. Many have been highly critical and many of the critics are reasonable as the game lacks depth and feels restricted + repetitive. Only a fan, like me, would continue investing time...That is where Hawken comes in, although both games were in beta over similar periods, the games could not be more different from each other. MWO is a serious simulator with a physic system true to quasi reality, Hawken is a fast paced mech sim with some fps elements, but a suave touch to it. Hawken differs from MWO that in that is richer in content (cinematics, destroyable environments, TUTORIALS, SLICK INTERFACE), easier to get in (there is no complex torso/leg rotation systems) and has more attractive game modes.The latter point is where this game really made it for me. More game modes = MORE FUN!They aren't exactly innovative game modes, but they throw a challenge of well balanced, fast paced and competitive play which make the game much more interesting than your regular fps. Tactics, team play, deployable items, and a plethora of game play options make this an enjoyable experience + the community is nice to the newbies :pFinally, the entry level bundle, packs a reasonable mech line up, I instantly fell for the Infiltrator, some currency to spend and  most of what you need to get started.This game could not be more different than MWO. They are both mech online competitive simulators, but the target audience is quite different. I would say that this is an excellent game for those who are tired of your gazillion COD out there, enjoy MWO but want something more casual while retaining some of the core elements of tactical mech play.Give this game a try. It's good fun and better than most online shooters out there!"

Hawken makes me want to keep coming back for more. The players are skilled, and while some mechs are more powerful than others, it all comes down to the skill of the pilot (you). So yes, while everyone is going to be busy playing Titanfall, I will be busy playing Hawken.The gameplay itself is amazing and self paced. And while now that it is free to play (before, you had to buy either the Prosk Starter Kit or the Nemesis bundle to play), the in game ""meteor points"" can only be obtained by real world cash. This sucks because you can't paint your mech or customize it without those meteor credits. The MCs are also used to purchased other mechs early, even though you can save up your Hawken points and buy mechs with those, the Hawken points are made by playing matches. The problem with that though is that the end matches rarely generate tons of points, and honestly? Hawken feels more like Pay To Win at times. I wish the development team would allow you to earn Hawken points even slightly easier and make the customization option expanded to Hawken Points as much as Meteor Credits.Aside from the slightly ridiculous market system, Hawken is a very good game. I usually play with a controller attached to my computer, but the controls with the keyboard are simple and you can do amazing things with those controls. They train you quite well before you go into an actualy player vs. player match. It is beautifully textured and I looked forward to future updates of the game."
