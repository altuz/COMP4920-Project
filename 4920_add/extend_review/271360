76561197999100829,Recommended,271360,17543068,"Posted: 14 August, 2015",all,ZeroInCircles,"This is one of the games, that brings the ""thumb up or down""-system to its knees.The game itself is not that much of a complex economic simulation. It's a resource-management game that gives you the opportunity to create stuff from resources and sale it in your stores. It's your job to organize the location of your factories and stores, plan lines of productions, set prices, watch surrounding cities growing and plan your logistics.It's a re-release of an older game, so don't expect high end graphics or fancy animations. The only thing you will hear, are some simple effects and different background music, which you will turn off at a certain point.If you like games like Transport Giant, OpenTTD or Capitalism 2 then you should take a look at it.The problem with this game is a technical one. Actually, there's more than one problem. First, like the retail version it seems to have trouble with every graphic processor that is not from stone age and as long as you run a newer modell, the game won't even start. You can prevent this, by starting it in windows comp mode (WinXp or earlier). Second, right now there seems to be a problem with some Win10 systems. The problem should be known by the dev team now and if the publisher wouldn't have a history of non-delivered patches, I could be optimistic. Third, there're some glitches and flickering that may occur under particular circumstances. Best advice to get rid of that, would be closing all programs you don't need at the moment of playing the game.Ok, there have been games with bigger problems and patching a game after release to make it more stable seems to be a common practice at the present time. But this case is different: These problems were known for years, long before the new dev team kicked in. I'm asking: Where is quality assurance? Did they do any Beta tests? If you buy this game now, you give the dev-team and the publisher a big advance for work there is still to do, to make this game consumer-friendly. Question is: Will they do it, if they hadn't done it in past?There is a very high chance, that if you buy this game now, you will have some kind of issue, but the good news is, that these issues are known to the community, waiting years for a stable version of this game. So in most cases there will be some sort of fix. The game itself is a economic goldie. If you get it running on your system, you will have a lot to enjoy. A smoothly rising difficulty, endless maps and maybe they will add a working multiplayer to it, but even without there are plenty of gaming hours to play.I recommend this game to people interested in economic simulation or logistic games, being aware of the technical issues. Waiting a few weeks, taking an eye on possible updates, is also a good idea."

76561198013970151,Recommended,271360,17540715,"Posted: 14 August, 2015",all,Lord Jebus VII,"I played this game for hundreds of hours as a child and it's great to see it working again (the game is notorious for poor hardware support).For a 13 year old game it holds up fairly well, although it does have several usability quirks that stand out such as build and info menus only closing when you press the X button rather than clicking anywhere off the menu as is much more common these days. Selecting moving vehicles can be a pain as well and so selecting your trucks from the vehicle status menu is advised.Unlike many of the transport tycoon simulators out there, IG2 lets you manage the production of goods from start to finish. Each factory, mine, farm, refinery and so on, have their own production levels which change depending on the availability of resources. In other words, a ranch in grasslands produces more milk than one on a beach. This makes production more complicated as you add more stages of manufacturing before reaching a final product but the financial rewards are worth it. You also get to set the price of the products and place your stores in key locations to manage demand. Always make sure the demand is slightly higher than supply to prevent buildups of unsold goods in your storage areas. You can also export goods overseas for a reduced profit but the demand is always high. The range of goods available to export is slim though, conversely you can import goods for a higher price but without the hastle of producing it yourself.As the game goes on you unlock a vast range of products and vehicles from inflatable dinghies to luxury cars. The number of options is impressive but may leave players feeling overwhelmed with choices that often won't make much difference.One area the game does disappoint I feel is the transport side, although you can choose from lorries, trains, planes and ships there are few circumstances where the lorries aren't the best option, even over large distances. You don't get to set their route either so you can't choose to avoid a busy downtown area in lieu of the empty country road you just built. With trains you do get to choose which tracks to take, but you don't get to choose which platform they use and with a maximum of 2 tracks in and out of each station (2 per side if the trains turn around rather than passing through) bottlenecks at your large stations are an issue that has long since been solved on other transport sims.It is disappointing that this remains one of the best games in the genre, it is a good game certainly, but there are lots of little issues you feel would not exist if they remade the game today. I would also advise caution when buying as it will not play on many computers. I have owned six PCs over the years and this game has only worked on two of them. This version does appear to work better than the original with the Nvidia patch, but do not be surprised if you have to ask for a refund. It's a shame that such a classic can't be enjoyed by a wider audience.(It works for me on an Nvidia GTX 970 and on my GTX 770, both on Windows 10, since the issues seems to be graphics related you should be OK with either of these)"

Lots of transportation options.- Very little guessing with the products. Lots of graphs and statistics tell you exactly how much of a product will be produced and consumed at each factory/store. This really helps optimizing.- In-game wiki describes each product, where it is made, where it is sold, and what it takes to make.Cons:- Graphics are outdated (early 90s sprites). This doesn't really bother me a ton, but it could bother others.- You never miss something until it's gone: the interface is outdated. Specifically, there is no time dilation (faster/slower) or pause. There is no view rotation which can make hooking up roads/rails difficult.- The range of their buildings should be rebalanced. I find myself constantly either kicking myself or just taking dynamite to things because they are just out of range. Often by just one or two squares.Nitpicks:- They skimped on their English translator. You get the gist of what they're conveying, but it is off-putting. Names aren't exact so if you look for one thing, it's often called something else (though similar enough).- Trains need brains. Even with two rails, they often go down the same side and slow each other down.Edit: Found on the forums that + increases speed and - decreases. ""P"" will pause. Still marking them down for not showing key bindings in the options or something. Who knows what other keys I'm missing?"

Got it back when I was a kid.The box version would not run on modern PCs, but this steam version does run. I had only one crash. I guess the Devs did an ok job on remastering the game.The game sets you up in a role of an entrepeneur, you decide what your company will produce and sell. Sadly there is no simulation of inter-company trade.Eg. You could focus on being a supermarket.You grow your own fruit orchard, have a dairy farm, and makes wine to sell in your own chain of stores.You adjust prices of your goods and the demand-supply curve will adjust to your price. City grows overtime as you open new types of stores in the city (growth is VERY slow).You must control all three sectors of business (Produce. Manufacture, and Retail) and also manage logistics for your goods.It is good to play in campaign mode, deadlines forces you to make difficult choices, as your finances are limited and must be used in the most efficient manner. Eg. Would I set up a new production line (costs millions) next to a big city or would I buy a new cargo ship to supply that huge city across the map with goods made elsewhere? Would the transport cost break even or make a good return on investment?My advice is to start slow and do not grow too fast.The system is fairly simple when you get used to the quirky controls of the game.Warning: The ESC button returns you to the main menu.---------------------------------------------------------------------7.5/10It's a good simulator, but it's not the best.It's a good test of macro management skill.It does not promote varying play-style, you will find one working formula and probably stick to it."

Then when I opened it something about the UI hit me, and I didn't want to bother learning it and asked for a refund.  But they told me I had owned it long enough they wouldn't refund it (even though I had only played for 1 hour).  So fine... I decided to try it again.  And it is fun - but it borders on tedious in places.Hints would have helped this game a lot.  Like ""Hint: + and - will change game speed.""  That's a big one.  Or ""Hint: Just because water looks contiguous doesn't mean a boat can go through it because the graphics are buggy.""  That one kind of sucks.What would I compare this to?  It strangely reminds me of Factorio - some of the same logistics take place here, and some of the same tedium.  What is not like Factorio is the possibility of having maintenance costs that overwhelm an economy into a downward spiral.  This is a really great feature of the game.  Build a bunch of warehouses and a ton of transportation and watch the balance sheet go deeper and deeper into the red with no hope of reversal!This is probably more accurately a precursor to Anno 2017 - although I find this more playable and engaging - maybe because has more logistical puzzles than Anno has (for example the warehouse placement can introduce interesting problems).This is an economic sim.In all I'm happy they refused to give me the refund.  This is not a bad game, and it was worth the effort overcoming small learning curve and UI."

I owned this on disc many years ago, and I have not been disapointed with this re-release, which enables you to run the game in full HD.  It is unfortunate that others have experienced problems when running the game - I have had no such issues (NVIDIA GTX 660, Windows 10).  I would advise those individuals to try again with the latest verison as a couple of patches have been released since launch.Before starting the campaign, I recommend completing the three tutorial missions.  If you happen to close a dialog by mistake, which I did find frustrating at times, most can be re-opened from the message window (mail icon in the bottom left of the screen).As for the campaign itself, I cannot comment much at this time as I have not been playing the game for long.  However, I remember playing the original game for many hours and finding it highly enjoyable.In summary, highly recommend for those who have not experienced Industry Giant II before and for those fond of the original game who have always wanted a version that would work on a modern PC in full HD."

,Recommended,271360,17542001,"Posted: 14 August, 2015",all,Ikke,"Although it's advertised to work on Windows 7, 8 and 10, some people have problems with this game. There are a couple of fixes mentioned on the forum that seem to work for most people, but be aware that you'll probably have to spend 5 or 10 minutes getting the game to work, as I had to do as well. This is an old game after all (released 2002), and wasn't developed to be compatible with our modern hardware.The game itself is what I consider somewhat of a classic. Even though the Jowood games catalogue consists of relatively obscure titles like Traffic Giant, Transport Giant, and Hotel Giant, I think they have made some of the greatest classic tycoon-genre games ever made (apart from the *real* classics of course - you know which ones I mean).IG2 combines goods transportation (similar to their other game Transport Giant) with industry and production management, and the result is a pretty fun game that, even though it shows its age in a number of places, will keep fans of the genre entertained for a decent amount of time.To me it's worth its current discounted price (12€), to get to play a more or less ""fixed up"" version of a game that I used to play a lot of. Without the nostalgia I would probably find it just a bit overpriced, especially the full price (15€) I think is pushing it for an old game like this. But it's definitely still a fun game, no matter how old it is."

The fact is, on some PC's it runs better than on others. From what I've heard about the developers, these various bugs may or may not get fixed. However, my PC runs the game just fine, and, to me, it is very playable and enjoyable in its current state. I would suggest buying the game and, if you have problems with it, simply return it. As I've seen, there seems to be no way to tell if the game will run on your system or not. It's not all NVidia graphics cards, which I use, its not later versions of windows, I'm currently on 10. Just try the game out and hopefully you can get the unique experience that I've been looking for in a game for a long time.The game itself reminds me of Anno in that you have to set up production chains and turn products into other products. What was missing for me from Anno was the ability to just focus on the business aspect of the game. No diplomacy, no ecobalance, just making products. Now to be fair, I am a nerd. I like to see efficiency and to make small numbers get larger. If you don't like working with numbers, this game might not be for you. I for one like looking at my cow farm and deciding that I can run it at 75% efficiency to supply demand, or making the perfect ratio of wheat farms to donut factories. Hopefully the developers will keep their promises, fixing bugs and even adding multiplayer. I've even heard talk of a sequel, so I would be very excited to see a modernazation of this classic."

As of writing this review, I have not gotten to the late game yet.I would also not be too quick in comparing it with OpenTTD, as some reviewers seem to do. The similarities between the games are merely that they are 2D isometric games which feature vehicles. The base game of OpenTTD focuses on transporting one of about 10 different goods with very simple production chains, this game features complex production chains and much more flexible vehicles, which allow you a much greater ability to plan efficient routes (For example a truck can transport one good one way and another the other way)Overall I think you should try the game out. As other reviewers pointed out, there is the chance it might not run on your computer, however if that proves to be the case you can just take advantage of Steam's refund policy.In the past, the game had low frame rate issues, but I'm very happy to report that this has been fixed!

I used to have LAN games with my friend that would last entire weekends. There's just so much you can do in this game!As for whether it's worth getting the Steam version, that's an absolute yes!As I said, I used to play this game a long time ago, and then it started to have issues running on modern PC's. They released and nvidia patch, which got it working, but it was still pretty glitchy at times. (Flashing graphics, sometimes things just not appearing on screen etc.)So far, my time with the Steam version has been flawless, and I'm running it in Win 10 Pro 64bit with a GTX 1080ti.All the movies work, the tutorials work, gameplay is smooth. The only issue I've even seen so far, was when I went to one of the options in the main menu (I don't recall which one atm) and upon choosing it, the game kind of slowed to a crawl as one of the graphics in the background of the menu scrolled across. Given this was before I had tried to play, I was initially a bit concerned, but strangely, I only experienced it once. After quitting the game, and trying that menu again on subsequent runs, I have not seen it re-occurr.They've honestly done a fantastic job with restoring this game to its full glory!My only gripe really, is its limited resolution (at least for me.) I've seen others say they can play at 1440p, but for me, the biggest resolution I can get to show up, is 1920x1200. I honestly don't know if the engine could really handle running at 3840x2160, but I would  like to try at least. I'd even be happy if I could play at 1440p. Still, even though I can only really run it at 1920x1080 (without it looking a bit warped) it still looks great, and plays so well that I can let it slide.If anyone knows a way to trick/force the game to show me higher resolutions, I'm all ears!!Should you buy it?

I have loved this game ever since it came out 13 years ago and was really disappointed when even with all the online fixes, patches and workarounds I could find, I could not get it to work on my new pc or laptop.I emailed the devs last year who said they were working on a version that would work with modern day computer's and their operating systems, but did not see anything further.Then yesterday I see it drop on steam and immediately by it whilst it was on sale at £8 and I was upset to learn it still wouldn't work. Read some forums and tried a few workarounds including various different compatibility modes, but no dice.I shut down my pc and rebooted and just as I was about to send an email to the devs, venting my frustration and requesting assistance or an eta on a fix, I decided to boot the game again (with no compatibility modes turned on), so that I could get the error code and Boom, worked first time and worked flawlessly all evening last night.So to all who buy this game wanting it to work, try the workarounds, shut down and reboot your pc to try and make it work, you never know your luck. The fact it does work though on my PC which has an overlocked i7, GTX 780 ti, Windows 7 pro 64 bit, shows that there has been progress in making this game compatible with modern day PCS.Unfortunately it does appear that its not universally working so yes its a risk, but if you played this game in the past and enjoyed it as much as I did, its worth the risk especially with the steam refund policy that now exists."

You can play endless, where you don't really have a goal. You can just play the way you like. But if you want a goal, there is also a campaign mode which contains missions with goals you have to complete in order to win.The soundtrack does get boring after a while but you can turn it off and listen to your own playlist (via Youtube for example).

I can't find it past the bugs and the noise however.Industry Giant 2 is an old-school tycoon type game. Don't let the release date fool you. This game came out in 2002 and was a bit dated even back then. I can get by the graphics even if it does take a fair amount of squinting. That's not the issue.The issue is the ""quality of life"" improvements that we've seen these 15 years are not reflected in the game. For instance, getting something as simple as milk from one place to another takes the following steps:1. Build cattle farm2. Go into cattle farm and select milk3. Build warehouse near farm4. Build truck depot near farm5. Build market near destination city6. Build warehouse near destination city, making sure it's within the market radius7. Build truck depot near destination city, making sure it's within the warehouse radius8. Build road to connect the farm depot with the city depot, making sure to connect the exits on both of the truck depots that are often hidden by the header over the depot (and you can't rotate the map)9. Go to the farm depot, click to choose the type of truck, hit accept10. Go to the next screen, tell it what you want to collect and whether it waits until it is full to run the route11. Click on the destination depotIf you've managed to do all of this correctly - and often the game gives an error - then your little truck will pick up milk and drive it to the destination city. Then there's the fiddling with the price, quantity supplied, amount produced, etc.*phew*  That's a bunch of steps! If that kind of micromanagement doesn't bother you then this might be your type of game. It kind of is my type as well.But then there are the numerous bugs. There are your normal lockup/crash type issues here but sometimes the game glitches and entirely screws you over. For instance, on the very first scenario I did the following steps. For some reason the AI decided it was a good idea to have other cars use my dirt road which terminated at my truck depot. They wouldn't move and the line of AI cars kept getting bigger and bigger which prevented my trucks from reaching the depot. With no way to remove the cars, I had to restart the scenario and there wasn't any part of that which was my fauilt. That's just the game deciding to take a dump on my scenario. Then the next time through it crashed and I lost what progress I had made. This does not make Blackadar happy.Then there are the QoL improvements that I spoke of earlier. The devs decided that bird noises were the best way to fill players' speakers and thus be prepared to here a cacophony of bird and other noises piercing your airspace. The interface is simply too small in spots and trying to see what you're doing can be difficult. You can't rotate the map and getting to certain spots or even buildings can be difficult - and this matters when you're trying to link up tracks/roads and so forth. It's an older game and there's been nothing done to bring it up to today's UI standards. Then there's the income statement which only shows per YEAR which means it's very difficult to figure out whether you've turned things around or not. Losing money and made some adjustments? Well, you're not going to be able to tell because there's no monthly income statement! That's a pretty massive oversight in a business sim.I might load this up again someday and see if it will work. But in the meanwhile, I've been unable to get through the very first scenario because it's simply not very stable. And even if I could get through it, I'm not sure if it's worth the effort. That's the issue here and the reason I can't recommend this game."

In this game you produce the initially resources, process them and then sell them to your retail outlets in towns and cities that grow, while controlling the logistics and infrastructure as well."

I just hope there will be a worthy succesor of this someday ...until then just stick with this one ,it's a good game and has  a lot of depth to occupy you for hours and still has decent graphics although being 10-15 years old."

Although the looks and the ui is somewhat outdated, the mechanics are still absolutely amazing.  It's a true business simulation where things go downhill when they left unattended unlike most build n thrive no brainers. There are tons of gameplay elements to fiddle with to optimize your production chains from raw materials to finished goods on the market. Definetely still worth a try if you havent already."

They had a weird glitch where it was incompatible with GeForce cards.  Like, ALL GeForce cards.  Since the existence of the GeForce I haven't been able to play this game.  I'm so happy I finally have it!Now on to the actual game.This game is a transport and economics sim with a very simplified mechanic.  Make goods, move goods, sell goods.  Trains are very forgiving- there's no signals or collisions here.  The early missions are pretty easy but later on there are some really cool interesting tasks.I don't know if it holds up with age, I just know I love it."

There is just a charm about it that I can not place.It's a classic, it's an old game, so the Graphics are not modern, but more or less 2D, like in the good ol' days.It could use some optmization, but overall, it's an oldy, but goody."

That means you're building mines to collect resources and then build stuff out of those resources, then building either railway or use trucks or airplanes to get your stuff to the cities to sell them.It's really fun and i love it."

In the beginning i was worried to see only one campaign for each level but as you go on and pass a campaign it unlocks and makes visible a new one. So you have enough campaings and for many different levels of players. New products and industries are added as time goes by (within a game) which is a nice addonCould make some changes as every time i try to mute the music and sound effects it crushes,tutorials are a bit poor and maybe make it possible to make time pass quicker."

I emailed JoWood support and recieved no response. I eventually concluded that JoWood were never going to put the effort into fixing a 7 year old game and then shortly after they disappeared into the history books.13 years after the release and I once again get to enjoy this classic game. The more I play it the more I realise how advanced it was for its time, features such as the control of production, influces of a city's growth, but it is all to do with supply and demand."

I turned the sound all the way down but it didn't help, all of the sounds are still there and when I try to turn the music off the game crashes. I enjoy playing the game while I watch videos but I can only play for awhile before the cuckoo runs me off.  It is a great game and a lot of fun to play so I would reommend it to anyone who doesn't mind the noise or turning their sound down on their computer."
