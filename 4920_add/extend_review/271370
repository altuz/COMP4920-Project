While challenging, it was also fun to play and I spent many hours completing the campaigns. Unfortunately, since it's been released on Steam, I haven't had much success or fun with it. The first three laptops I tried to install it to and play it on were not successful. I had the flickering issue on the main menu page --which didn't clear up and there's no help or bug fix to resolve it. On the third laptop, I was finally able to play it for awhile and saved several missions --but then had a different issue where the game would crash. Now I'm on my fourth and final laptop and playing it in compatibility mode for windows 7. No crashes yet, but have to replay each campaign because although all my saved games may be played, it doesn't let me advance to the next level until I open and complete the previous levels. So unfortunately I can't recommend this game at this time. If there is some better support for different graphics drivers and game crashes in the future, then maybe."

The graphic is a bit old but who cares when you have a lot of fun in this package.The game works just fine on my desktop.  I played already more than 20 h on Win 8.1 and have no problems at all with it. On the Surface I couldn't play it because of the onboard graphic card but I saw there is a remark on that in the discription.
,Not Recommended,271370,11994865,"Posted: 5 September, 2014",all,BigMeatSwang'n,"*******EDIT: (9/9/14) So after some messing around I found that running the game in a resolution like 1280x1024 seems to improve the lagging and stuttering I experienced while moving about the map. Now, it's not great but it's better then when I'm running at 1920x1200. Hope that helps.*******Unfortunately this game does not, at this time, receive my recommendation because the game performs like garbage. It really upsets me to see this great title being defamed in this manner. Everything that is great about this game has been there since the original game and United Independent Entertainment GmbH has taken that exact game, made some nice little additions, allowed for HD widescreen resolutions and that seems to be about it.  At any speed, moving around the map is near impossible, it stutters and jerks about, sometimes continuing to move around long after I’m done pressing the left or right key. Needless to say this performance issue is pretty severe and I’d imagine that we won’t hear anything from the developers in the form of a response regarding this seemingly widespread issue, but I’m hoping this is one of those “feel good” gaming stories where the Scumbag Steve actually ends up being the good guy Greg.On the bright side I love what this game was and would love to be able to play it in “HD” without having to quit in frustration because the game cannot handle moving about the map. If this issue is addressed and patched you can be sure I’ll be recommending this game."

Nice features for a small game and a lot of opitons for a great transportnetwork.This game is simular to the 2004 game Transport Giant Gold Edition.There are a few new feautures who are added on. And the tool to zoom out/in has become a great tool to oversee your map!What I realy miss in this steam version: "" the competitors "". When you start a random map/free to play, the game asks you how many compeditors you want to add on, but they never show to your list of competitors. With this big miss no one can make a nice strategy to overpower the map and take-over other competitors.What the builders could think about:- add on competitors- real-life signs: like orange : the trains might go pass the signal but wiht a lower speed- new bridges with the option for tonages (it forces to the player to make a strategy)- separate the look of the industries between continents. The city's have a diffirent look but not the industries (the wheat farms for example are in a American style. In real life European farms don't have those)Overall it is simular to the 2004 game. A few new things are added on but also the big loss of compediotors.If you want to create your own transportroutes this might be a nice game for you."

I was never able to modify the forestry, but i wanted larger mines. nope, no matter what i've changed in the config, the game uses what he wants. so, sorry, but this is not what I WANT.- LOW FP RATE. like in none. on larger resolution, yeah, is nice to see a big part of the map so you can plan your transport and so on. but nothing is moving. NOTHING.so.. i am trully sorry to say NO. DO NOT BUY IT. DO NOT TRY IT EVEN FOR FREE. if you care of your eyes and time.until at least the flickering issue is solved for good, no way in hell i am gonna play this one again.and this is too bad because, despite ancient graphics, i still consider this one better than the new launched Transport Fever ( which is a shameless rip off of TG )."

Strange, but it's OK, I have played railroad tycoon, Can't be much different.Before I go much further, I must say that I did not expect this game to be visually pleasing, I was expecting something low spec. And I was not disappointed, with old 16bit block graphics style game play smoothed off a bit.But that aside, I started playing, I choose an open play ""sandbox"" style of UK, and I started from the beginning, 1850.Wow was I wrong about it not being too hard to pick up, I have a total of less than ten hours on this game, The first two was setting up a transport link and trying to set up a route.After all that, I was suddenly drawn to how much it had cost me, How much it was costing me to maintain buildings, And how much I was loosing on each run!After a few more hours setting up different trade routes It struck me as how hard it was to make any money, I was just keeping afloat mostly,Starting from the 1850's I only had access to horse and cattle, a few years on I got a train and some ships, One of which was 6.5MILLION!!! to buy, you start the game with 15M and I was fast down to less than one million, So I fast forwarded time to gain some funds, and for some reason, The white house appeared in Cornwall? Quirky.I also noticed at this point the lack of transport options, I was still in ""horse and cart"" mode, Starting on my railway, I did a long link between two factories, That was great fun and was a money earner, I was back up to a few mill in no time, So I went to do another rail link.....And For some reason, I cannot place another station anywhere on the map? I looked this up on the internet and apparently it is a bug, And to my surprise, one of MANY! No, Seriously!Many of the bugs I have not come across yet, But this along with no hover over tool tips, The inability to do roads/rail in 8 directions (can only be done 4 directions) and the awkwardness of setting up routes (route manager disappears when you move the map with the mouse, you have to use the arrow keys!) just makes the game look underdeveloped.I have reluctantly decided to call it a day for this game, And it cost me a GBP £10.99, Steam will not give back money for you buying rubbish that they offer, You have been warned, Please research what you can about a game before you give it to steam.It might sound a little harsh, If you decide to put up with all the flaws, your a better person than me, I just can't play this game.Thank you for your time."

Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, the game fails to bring that excitement. A decent amount of work was put into making this game, but that is all - just decent. Although for a 2004 game the graphics are up to par, there are notable interface and menu design problems that make it difficult for players to play as smoothly as they did with Transport Tycoon and the Railroad Tycoon series. To be specific, the menus and features of the game-play are not  not intuitively designed (hard to navigate). Another issue is the limited amount of information the game provides about vehicles, stations, industries and cities.I will not say that I am disappointed at this game, but I will say that I hope whoever continues the legacy of making transportation games, uses way more care and attention in desigining such games by learning from the mistakes of their predecessors.All in all, Tranport Giant is a FAIR attempt at reviving the dead era of transportation games, but in falls short of being exciting and addictive. JoWood Entertainment, the make of the game, is no longer with us! Hopefully someone will come around and end our wait by making the next awesome ""transport tycoon"" game."

It still is, but there are better alternatives nowadays.The only things I really noticed that are new is high-resolution support and a refreshed UI (visuals only).I'd like to compare this with Train Fever, they are similar in terms of realism.This game has a few more ways of transport (e.g. ships, planes, friggin zeppelins!).But that's where the advantages end. This biggest disadvantage of this game is that so many interaction things like building a railtrack or making a schedule is SO QUIRKY! When you're almost done planning out your train's route you accidentally press the right-mouse button and boom, all effort gone! :(Performance wise it's okay, unless you zoom out fully, which made my game run at 2 fps, not really enjoyable.I recommend saving up an extra €10 and buy Train Fever instead.Maybe if you really like 2D games or just love the nostalgia like me you should buy it."

It does not add new things, it adds compatibility to modern operating Systems and high monitor resolutions for a game released in 2004. And that is fine for me.I have seen many complains about grafic problems. Personally i don't have such problems. There is only very very rarely a flickering while zooming. The game runs fine on my system, a GeForce 580 GTX with latest Nvidia drivers on Win7 64bit. But the variety of computer systems out there is nearly endless and the game seems to have problems with some. As far as i know, the game devs are working on bugfixing right now.The gameplay is as solid like it was in 2004. You build two station, a road/railway between them, add a transport vehicle, click on the goods you want to transport and wait until you get the paycheck from it. While this is convenient simple, the whole mass of different goods and production chains makes it complex and interessting. You can focus an some goods or transport ways, offer passenger service to a region or become a real ""Giant"" an the whole spectrum of transportation.At this point, i really miss a windowed-mode and there are still some bugs with the endless mode. But i have hope that there will be a fix soon.I want to mention one more thing. ""Transport Giant"" is not ""Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe"" nore want it to be this game. It came in 2004 defnitetly inpired by the classic game, but thats it. ""Transport Giant"" focuses more on complex chains for differnt goods.The free OpenTDD has a devtime of 10 years now, not to mention the 10 years after release of the original title. Every game with so much working hours can make something better in therms of stability.just my 2 cents to that.Edit:One year has passed and there was a grafics fix for flickering just a few days ago. Does it help some people? Sure. But ONE year for a 2,5MB fix? NOT acceptable at all. And there are still no AI competitor in endless mode. This game is NOT like the original and propably will never be because of incompetend publishing.Today, i would give it a 5/10"

You can maximise your profits with intelligent planning of your transport system and delivering the whole production line from the pig, over the slaughter, to the fast food factory and the final destination in the next city.Due some bugs like no competitors in free games or you can't place train stations individual, you will possible don't have that much fun. The game is lagging as hell also on higher zoom levels and it's missing a tutorial.This game is a classic. But UIG showed their quality again. More resolution, old bugs and never hear about that game again. You can play it, but you will need to deal with the bugs for the rest of your live.3/10"

The new UI-design looks really better than in the original version of the game (10years ago). And it supports 1080p resolution with 120hz, really great!Just dont use the new superzoom-function, this will cause the game to get little bit laggy. But if you play it at the common zoom level, its really stable and stable, even in 1080p.If you liked the game in the past, just buy it- it´s now worth the money."
