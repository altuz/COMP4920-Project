76561198013594452,Not Recommended,271500,8924251,"Posted: 31 January, 2014",all,Firearm Encyclopedia,"I played the game just long enough to find out either the hit detection is way off, or soldiers were able to take several rounds without flinching. That there are no adjustable sights, all firearms seem to be sighted in for 50m, and you generally won't be going much farther than that (Which is pitiful in a Sniper game because I can hit a man-sized target with a PISTOL at that range). Speaking of which, the silenced Luger P08 that you start out with isn't capable of being aimed with iron sights, only hip fired. You also can't use the iron sights of your sniper rifle, only the scope. Also, there's wind effects on the go in this game. Apparently in WWII, wind could go in pretty much any direction at any time, strong enough to potentially sway a 150-200gr rifle round going 2500-2850 ft/s off the point of aim within the mere distance of 50m. If you're on a budget, love sniping games, and this is the ONLY one you can afford, then I suppose you could get it, however I doubt you'll find much enjoyment. You'd be far better off getting a game such as Red Orchestra II.Adjustable sights, bullet drop at a distance, ability to use either scope or iron sights with the push of a button in case you get caught in close range, pistols actually have useable iron sights, and even if a player survives a rifle round, they might still bleed out in short time. Then there's the ability to rest your firearm against a window sill/door frame/rock/almost anything to make your aiming almost perfectly steady, even if you're a bit out of breath. There's a plethora of other realistic qualities in RO2 if that's what you're after. If you want an easier game of lesser quality and lower price, look no further. This one might keep you busy while you're on a tight budget.Perhaps this game was made around 2004 or something and I expect too much of it, feels like something that'd be on the PS2. At least the sights on the scope are realistic for the time, unlike that damn Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie game that came out a while back. There is so much wrong with that game's ballistics... don't get me started."

,Not Recommended,271500,18223725,"Posted: 27 September, 2015",all,Shadow Knight,"I got this game for free when I bought one of the Sniper Ghost Warrior part. And well it is an old City Interactiv game which should say everything about the quality of the game but I still made the mistake and played it.Negative PointsAI- The AI is horrible. They will detect you from 20 kilometers away, they can see you through all kind of buildings and vegetation, if you hit them they immediately find you, often they dont react if you just killed one of their group etc.Hit Detection / Hitboxes- Also pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Sometimes you just dont hit the enemy even if you perfectly aim at him. Also the enemies can take a lot of bullets if you dont hit their heads (which is a problem due the low ammo you have and the problem that the game dont recognize that you clearly aim at them).Options and controls- Only 2 different resolutions available, no real sound option- The controls are buggy, you slide around pretty oftenSavepoints- Just ridiculous. Sometimes the game autosaves the game just a few seconds before you get killed. And if you load that savegame you get instantly killed again so the savegame is brocken.- Sometimes I tried to save the game via Quicksave, the game said ""Saved"", I died and the game started from a totally differnt spot (what means IT DID NOT SAVE THE GAME). Good work!Graphics- Very bad for today standards. I am not sure when this game was released (the most sources name a release date between 2007 - 2008). This would mean that the graphics of this game was still below the average when it was released.Story- Completly rubbish. The story makes no sence, the missions are boring and you have to do always the same. The monologues/dialogues are so freaking bad, the voice acting (german version) is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... it is just a pain at all.- Story is short (around 2 hours) which normaly is a negative point but for this game I was really happy that I had not to suffer longer.Cut- German version of the game is cut (Nazi symbols AND gore effects) which means no swastikas, no blood, no ragdolls after death.Atmosphere- Nonexistent. You just dont feel like a sniper in WW2, the bad level design, the bad model design and the bad sound doing the rest.Bugs- This game is full of bugs. You get stucked so many times, the AI (especally with their trucks and tanks) are completly bugged, animation bugs, mission target bugs, problems with picking up a weapon etc.- Cutscenes are also buggy- Ladders are very deadly. Sometimes if you try to interact with a ladder you get killed. Going down the ladder is even more dangerous so I often just slided down the walls of the building..- Mission 5 is so buggy that my game crash many timesOther things- You can not zoom while you lean- Horrible placement of most ladders (you just fell from the roof when you go up a ladder because the end of the ladder is so badly placed)- Your team mates kill you if you ran into their fireline (but you cant kill them)- Only 2 sniper rifels avalible (also there are only 1 mp, 1 pistol and 1 knife/melee weapon)- There is a button for throwing grandes but I never had granades and I never found pickable granades. Maybe you just throw the granades back if an enemy use it but this would be non sense because they explode pretty fast so you would die in 99% of all trys)- Devs say that the game has a ""complex ballistic system"" - it is a lie.Neutral PointsNo Multiplayer- Game have no multiplayer. Not that bad because I am pretty sure that it wouldnt work and no one would play it anymore.Positive PointsNoneConclusionDo not buy it. I know it only costs around 3€ but this is way too much for this game. The game is bad, dont work properly and it is just a huge waste of time. Only russians defends this game because you are a ""russian snajper hero"" so do you a favor and dont buy/play it."

,Not Recommended,271500,13921222,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Skops,"Sniper: Art of Victory is an FPS game that is basically a discount Sniper Elite. If you know what the Sniper Elite franchise does, you'll find just about everything here mimic'd but done in lesser polish. If there was ever a phrase to describe this game, ""you get what you pay for"" fits this one perfectly.GRAPHICS:Art of Victory's presentation is painfully average. While there is nothing wrong with the models and terrain shape, the textures are sorely lacking. Everything is heavily washed out and nothing really has any detail, if you take a close look at anything; its just a blur. Animations are extremely stiff, the Germans will be in a walk cycle only to stop, look like they're about to attack, spin around, and continue walking.. it looks really goofy. Death animations also are stiff. When you shoot a soldier, they stiffen out and twitch about like their having a seizure. Just not good stuff here, I could go on, but there's other stuff to talk about. It should also be noted that this game does not support widescreen.GAMEPLAY:This is where the game falls apart; both creatively, and functionally. I say creatively because all of the shooting mechanics are completely and shamelessly ripped straight from the Sniper Elite series. When you aim down sight, you must hold your breath (which slows down time), control your heart beat, and adjust for bullet drop/wind. Then pull the trigger. You might also be greeted with a cinematic animation showing your bullets journey right into a soldiers face... Sound familiar? It should. Sniper Elite does all of that, but far better than whats displayed here.That is what you'll be doing for 90% of the game. You'll also be equipt with a silenced pistol and knife, but both of those will be utterly useless as you'll almost never get close to the enemy to use them. Even when you have an oppertunity, the pistol is so unbelievably inaccurate you'll miss 6/8 shots you take from 6ft away..This brings me to where Sniper: Art of Victory is just mechanically broken. There are times where you can aim dead center in someones chest, pull the trigger, and nothing happens. The hit regestration is peticularly fickle in missions 5 & 6 for seemingly unknown reasons. Not only that, but you will frequently be ensnared by the worlds geometry and may sometimes be forced to restart at a previous checkpoint.SOUND:The soundtrack to the game is all stereotypical war trumpets and orchestral tunes. Not bad, but nothing memorable. The sniper rifles have a good crack to them, at the very least, I would say it sounds like a rifle. The voice acting is unreal. I swear they just put words into a program and recorded the playback its that robotic.STORY:I honestly don't think there is a story here. You play as a sniper in the Russian Red Army and you run through eight seemingly unconnected missions to the campaigns completion. I didn't even know the protagonist was Russian until mission three's briefing file specifically saying ""glorious Red Army"". None of the missions are peticularly hard, one comes dangerously close to ripping off a famous scene from Enemy At The Gates. The game shouldn't take anyone more than 2 hours to get through.OVERALL:I'm a little devided on how I should view this game. It's creatively bankrupt; it doesn't try to do anything new with the genre, and even what it does, it's kind of broken while doing it. However, at its full price point of just $2.99 CDN (I bought it for $1.24), what can I really expect?I didn't hate this game, but I can't recommend it either. Put your $2.99 towards something else."

AI is miserable, as even your allies will kill you because they are only programmed to keep shooting in the same area where you are supposed to go. Enemies have superhuman hearing. The only reasonable explaination why you will not be able to sneak up on them, and why they can so accuratly triagnulate your position (if you miss a shot). There are only 4 different guns to choose from, the Luger and the MP40 hardly hits anything (even at close range). So make that only 2 guns that are usefull. Both of which are just different sniper rifles. You can't loot ammo from bodies, only swap out guns. Your choice; MP40 with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of ammo? OR an MP40 with an even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of ammo? There are 'guns' you an get through cheats (AK47, M60). However, there are absolutly no models for these, and they all take up the same inventory slot. Cheat Shotguns aside, the long list of cheat weapons became moot since most of them where 'Gun that shoots fast'.TL;DR: NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY"

I didn't play more than 40 minutes of this because:- Enemies are unforgivingly broken (shot at me through a wall across the map).- Controls are extremely slow and sticky (don't go prone near objects, you'll most likely get stuck and have to do an extremely slow reversing maneuvre).- The maps were lush and very good-looking, but didn't conceal THE BARBED WIRE PRISON FENCE keeping you inside the play areas. Nice level of detail and modelling, but quickly-seen-through player restriction in level design.- Story is paperthin and easily trashed by player interaction (first map objective is getting on an enemy truck - to get inside the camp with the truck, you have to kill everyone present (because they can see you through the walls), which would probably include any would-be driver).- Secondary weapons are useless because you will get killed by a spray of bullets as you round the corner (because they see you through the walls). Sniper rifle is useless when there are more than two enemies that need to be killed within a small timeframe.You'd be better off buying the later installments - Sniper: Ghost Warrior 1+2. A lot more balancing, budget and work put into those, guaranteed."

,Recommended,271500,8987492,"Posted: 5 February, 2014",all,Dr. Phil,"As a person who loves bad games, this is the cream of the crop.It's totally playable, once you accept the fact that 9/10 shots are going to miss the enemy's hitbox, which I can't for the life of me determine exactly where it is. If you stay at least 15 feet away from the enemy they're very unlikely to hit you since the AI stands in place and fires blindly for the most part.The story is generic and uninteresting and the voice acting is horrendous. The main character sounds like he's trying too hard and the NPCs sound like they stopped trying years ago. The rest of the audio design is not bad actually, the guns and explosions are alright, and the music is actually very good at times. But since the rest of the game is bad it just results in it being comedic.Ultimately, if you're looking for any kind of good game, you should know this isn't one based on the reviews :P But if you're a fan of bad games or are just desprate to play something old that's cheap, give this a whirl! It's definitely worth the $3.Needless to say, I stopped a while in when I discovered that there were copious amounts of holes in the level that I could get trapped in invisible walls and forced me to restart levels over and over again."

Skipped over the second, in hopes that a different setting and everything like that might make it more fun.2.8 hours logged on the game....and I've already beat it.the bullet physics SUCK, the fact that it's taking wind/breathing/etc into account is a given by this point in the series, the problem, however, is that with a ""sniper rifle"" a trained monkey shouldn't be missing shots at 75m at 575m, sure, but, ballistically, if you have your crosshair on your target, unless you're facing 20+mph crosswinds, the bullet is going to hit the target, and, most likely kill them.  if these guys keep developing similar games, they need to sit down with ballistics experts and have them explain what they're missing out on with the way they're handling shooting."

On the first mission, the game seemed ok, like let's just get through this game and dump it at the end.Stealth is well you can shoot enemies and it can take a few bullets.

Maybe the game designers were thinking they were being clever by adding in one other element to challenge the player that was unlike other games, but it's simply not fun at all and often it seems quite random whether you actually hit your target or not.  Second, ammo starvation to the max.  I don't even think you can get more than 30 bullets max per weapons, and with enemies always getting an instant kill on you, it's not like you're going to find more ammo easily.  Third, everything else: knifing people doesn't work, so it's not a stealth game, some missions are made impossible at a certain savepoint if you lack ammo, the pistol and submachine guns are horribly inaccurate, etc., etc., etc..  I wanted something like Hitman with a focus on the sniping part, but all I got was this really overthought, overchallenging, and unpleasant game."

Charecter control is horrid, there is some wierd char acceleration decelleration thing going on, he gets caught on almost everything and anything. It's hard to do simple things like climb over handrail and jump foot high cement blocks.2. The symbol for when i grenade is thrown at you is in the same style for the symbol for picking things up... got me a few times that one.3. Sometimes it seems like the bullets just miss for no reason, no wind, distance within 10m shot fired at headand.....miss?4. The aged graphics in combination with the charecter movent is nausiating.5. The game encourages aiming for the head and getting head shot over body shots. Most chars take 2-4 body shot to kill which seems silly considering the size of round we are firing compared to the amount of armor the enimies are wearing. As a sniper duing that era you would aim for 'kill' shot which would be a chest shot.The ugly (i dont mean graphics, just odd things i noticed)1.Picking up a mp40 makes the game 10000 times easier as it doesnt seem to have much if any of the sniper mechanics on its bullets.2. In the first few missions you play a Russian marksman stuck behind enemy lines, yet you start the game with a German Kar.98, doesnt quiet seem right."

Or if you run the area in a wild order then a group of enemies may suddenly have disappeared from a place they shoud be. The plan was to eliminate them and then you can't proceed with the mission because you can't kill them. You need to load a save point far back enough when the enemy still was there. Near the end of the game, as I restarted a mission, the cut scene was weird (companion standing still and nothing happening) and when the mission started he was still doing nothing. I could not go anywhere past him. I could continue that mission only because I had previously done a save point in the beginning of that mission and I was able to load that.In the other hand, some missions don't require you to do what all the instructions say. You can just proceed forward on the map and do the next task that is waiting there.Aiming is a joke. You will miss the target most of the time even if you shoot when there's no wind. Most of the time you can't kill enemy if you use pistol and manage to shoot five times from a few meters."

The hit detection is abysmal, the graphics are disgusting even for an old game and did I mention that the hit detection is awful, I shot the enemy sniper in the first mission straight on atleast five time before the game decided that he had been hit, the man survived several direct headshots because they weren't detected, if you want to kill a still target you might have to shoot to the side of them to ensure they actually take a hit. Moving targets are even worse, you can't anticipate their movements and shoot slightly infront of them, you just have to hope you can shoot them directly as they are running.

I had always been curious about this genre so I came in with an open mind (I normally play FPS).The graphics are terrible. In some places, you can see areas that don't even have textures. Nothing is interactive (not even doors).  Going prone is supposed to give you an advantage, but good luck seeing past the solid grass blocking your view, yet the enemy has no problem seeing you through a line of trees.The ""AI"" is cheap as enemies will spot you in a millisecond and shoot. If you're lucky you'll just be injured and not insta-death.  Your best bet is to shoot them in the shoulder from behind a wall or their crotch from under a jeep.  The hit box is terrible - you can have the aim dot square on their nose and take 5 shots before one actually hits!  How that would work in the advanced mode (no aim dot) is beyond me.The missions are generic and it may as well not have a story line at all.  The voice acting is likely done by the interns.  The game - even though from some estimates is only 4 hours in length - is artificial since half of the time you'll be be getting killed, repeat, killed, repeat.  Its particularly bad when you die just after a cut-scene and you have to repeat the cut-scene and there is no way to skip it.  I found myself rolling my eyes more times than I can count.Some reviewers say that the game was way too hard - I don't particularly agree unless you have Parkinsons or are playing on a laptop in the back of a school bus.  Yes the AI is cheap but not that bad, you just have to memorize the location of enemies and use necessary cover.I got to stage 8 when suddenly the game crashed. I thought the game save was corrupted so I tried to load an older save - crash.  I looked around for a quick solution but couldn't find much info on this game, so I just happily uninstalled it thinking other sniper games can't get any worse.  But it's like your first date - no matter how ugly you still will kinda remember it with some sick nastalgia. :)I highly recommend not to buy - I got it as part of a bundle."
