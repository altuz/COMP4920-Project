A bit more if you want to achieve gold on everything.The game has excellent balance.   Getting gold on a scene is challenging enough that you'll end up having to play many of them multiple times, while others you'll get right away.All achievements can be made by simply playing the game from end to end inclusive of the bonus challenges.   One note:  Make sure you click ""next"".  If you click ""back to menu"" the game doesn't register what you've done in the scene as counting towards the achievements.  I played the scenes a couple at a time so found myself clicking back to menu quite often and when I did that none of the achievements were popping up (became very obvious when I needed to fix 10 pipes and I did the one scene with six of them twice that it wasn't working).For a couple of dollars, well worth it."

The main game is cheesy, all-ages time and resource management, with some interesting mini-games in the mix. The timers on each level provide a decent level of challenge, and it's always possible to work out what you could have done to finish each level in time. The game functions well, the graphics all work together, the sound is a little annoying after a while, but easily muted. All in all a good game, but limited replayability means you should probably hold out for a sale."
,Recommended,271550,22623725,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,AbbydonPrime,"This is a welcome departure from the usual worker & resource management games. It's not a time management game as the time is only for arbitary bonus points. Unlike Alawar and similar light strategy games that follow overhead paths, this one goes the vertical and horizontal route. Also, it is possible to use up resources the wrong way and have to restart a level whereas the Alawar ones tend to not have a way to paint yourself into a corner.Some more aspects that make this game stand out to others in its class is the unique characters and story. Instead of following the tired ""inspired by history"" or ""rescue the whatever"" pattern, this one involves completely fictional creatures, the Tribloos. The story and dialog were entertaining and kept me going to figure out how it would end.Considering this game was essentially made by 3 people, it's very impressive. It was a nice addition to my casual game selection. There's nothing stressful about this game, the levels and puzzles can be worked out, and getting 100% achievements is simply a matter of playing the game, including the Challenge levels.The price is a bit on the high end, especially since the game has been out for over 3 years now, so you may want to wait for a sale. However, dedicated casual gamers might be willing to pay full price.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=672508107---For more...My Reviews||My casual gaming...Group|Curator Page"

Most of the levels are very easy to complete - the challenge lies in doing them quickly enough to beat the timer and get gold star ratings. There are 75 levels plus 15 bonus levels in the game, which for me amounted to about 20 hours total play time. Easy to pick up for 10 minutes and put down again."

(Like me!) Each chapter adds a new wrinkle, so you'll be learning new strategies throughout the game.The game's difficulty is moderate. For an experienced player, it is fairly easy to get the gold award on the levels in the first chapter, but getting the gold becomes a true challenge by the middle to end of the game. The punishment for failure isn't severe (you just try the level again, and you can skip the intro if you want). After the first few levels, you have to do tasks in the right order, or you'll get stuck and have to start the levels over.I found the art, animation, and music charming, and I also enjoyed the simple story. People with severe cuteness allergies should check the screenshots and videos before buying, though."

First two important questions, where can I get part one and when is part 3 coming out? This is a fun game for children and adults to play alike. These little guys really love to build. great graphics, relaxing music and loads of fun. I recommend this game to play after a hard day at work. Good job Devs."

Only got about half way through, not due to any fault of the game, I started playing something else and just didn't go back. I'm thinking about finishing it up since they have added Steam Trading Cards since I put it down. It's a cute time management game with a story line to it. I can't speak for how good the story is since I never finished it. For all I know everyone blows up at the end. If you can get it for a few bucks and like time management games, I reccomend it."

The downside is that it's hardly challenging for an experienced time manegement player to grab all the achievements. But it's adorable, enjoyable with a neat although simple storyline. And the later parts of the game requires some serious multitasking to get Gold-medals. But as I said, not required for all the achievements."

Needs some work on the text style (white outlines and a white background...) and needs a lot of work on English grammar and spelling (which is *very important* if you're selling this as an educational game). The game mechanics themselves are nice, though."

It probably gets a bit more frantic later on, but with so many good puzzle games out there for so cheap I didn't feel like it was worth the amount of time I spent just watching meters count down and clicking in an obvious spot once every 30 seconds. I was told this was similar to lemmings and that's probably part of my disappointment, as that's one of my favorite game franchises - none of the anxiety and feeling of need to solve the issues present in lemmings is here - it's just a timer and apparently doesn't even matter if you complete on time to progress."

76561197968553599,Recommended,271550,18592996,"Posted: 20 October, 2015",all,InfoSoph,"This is one of those games where you have to build structures and collect ressources in a particular order within a time limit. (Like the Labours of Hercules series.) All time limits are fair, so that a good player usually only needs a few tries maximum to get a ""gold time"". There are also a couple of achievements to unlock. There are also some nice tracks within the sounds. ;-)All in all a great little game. A bit slow at times. Includes about 100 levels, and takes around 12-14 hours to get through if you want all achievements."

Being a completionist certainly contributes to my long playtime - I finished every level with a Gold time rating - but also bear in mind that there are 90 levels to work your way through.On the whole I think that there could have been more variety with the resources and more complexity to the resource chains, but at least it does have a fair variety and does have resource chains. Although I don't mean to mislead you here. This isn't a resource management game, it's more like a gentle logic puzzle that requires some timing.GameplayThis is a bit of a god game in that you order your little furballs around. There are set buildings to construct which require resources that you must gather. Some buildings produce resources or tools which you will need in order to access all of the buildings or special resource goals for each level.Although the basic concepts are rather simple, you must figure out the best order to perform various actions, as well as managing your timing well. You don't want to be short on a resource for a building when you should probably already be halfway through its construction!One big downside would certainly be the repetitiveness. Some new resources will get introduced and the scenery changes every once in a while, but every level is pretty much the same thing. It never really ramps up the difficulty or complexity of the game.ControlsAll done with the mouse. You click on the blue circles to initiate a job, and then you can choose to add or remove tribloos to that job. More tribloos means it will complete faster, but you will find you need to reassign some of them to other tasks.StorylineThere is a storyline with some rather nice comic strip style artwork. These little bits of storytelling happen throughout the game. I must say though that it was the artwork I enjoyed more than the story, which seemed to be rather one dimensional and the characters flat. Nothing ever made me feel particularly protective of the furballs or very concerned about their survival.This might not the sort of game you buy for storylines, but if you're going to go to so much trouble to create all the artwork, I think that one should go to the same sort of effort with the writing.SoundI found the sound certainly complimented the game. It was generally relaxing music, although the sound effects were fairly innocuous. I would say that the sawmill's buzz-saw noise got tiresome after a while. The sounds at an end of a level along with the giant rainbow are definitely obnoxious, but one only has to suffer it at the end of each level.GraphicsI really enjoyed the art style of the game. Sure, it doesn't look terribly complex, but there is a nice organic feeling about it. Where the sound falls down, the visuals certainly pick up the slack.Pros+ easy to lean to play and complete+ a little challenging to get Gold+ lovely art+ did entertain me for 25 hoursCons-/+ treats the player like a child- dull, flat storyline- gets repetitiveHelp me Help youPlease• give me constructive criticism in the comments - tell me why the review wasn't helpful• upvote my Steam review if you liked it so that others are more likely to find it too!Rothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website.
