It's a kind of Unity game you can make in a week or two with about as much content and testing as that implies. My Xbox 360 controllers pull to the left randomly--often killing you--and there's no ability to adjust the game's joystick dead zones. The levels are very empty and non-interactive, and the puzzles get very hard very quickly. I'm used to old 80's/90's games where a twitch can kill you, but my wife isn't. So any time she dies, the round starts over at the beginning with no checkpoints.The puzzles just aren't fun enough to warrant dying 20, 30 times just to move forward. At least in better games where death is also common, the death is quick and gets you right back into the action. This one makes you walk... and walk... and walk... to the third part of a puzzle doing the same boring steps that you've already learned. ""Shoot guy, walk at a snails pace to pick up block, place on switch... controller moved me into a stray bullet and now I'm dead. Start over."" repeat 30 times.I'd definitely watch a Let's Play video from the very start to make sure this isn't going to bore or frustrate you before plucking down the $10 that I did."

This gets very annoying when you want to play a Co-op game with a friend but you can't because it won't connect. The singleplayer is pretty good, a Survival-type minigame where you have to try and fend off the Vege-monsters, robots and other strange but funny creatures. I quite like the way you can collect Ammo from the Wooden Crates, but also get a random new gun. Overall the Singleplayer Minigames are pretty fun.

After you saw all of levels there is not much of a point in playing it because you would by then know have to past a level really fast. The point of the game is to be in a sync with a friend. When you buy a game you get a gift key of the same game which you can give to a friend with whom you are going to play. The game also has a split-screen co-op option which is pretty nice. For a single player you can try to connect to a random game but i didn't have any luck with it, also you can play a endless challenge with halloween theme."

Long missions that are unenjoyable and easy are just not the kind of puzzle solving you want to be doing. Shop lacks items and are extremely cheap so it is easy to obtain high end shop items. I think this is a game just to laugh at for it's sheer stupidity as me and my friend did. I only recommend this to people with a large wallet that enjoy bad games.4/10.

How a regular person can even play, let alone enjoy this waste of time is beyond me.First of all, if you were looking for space farmers, you're in the wrong place. This game has little to do with space or farming whatsoever. It's about some ""farmer""-looking Minecraft Steve lookalikes traversing through some isometric-view action platforming.Sure, it was 90 cents in money wasted, but to get this POS even working for local co-op took half an hour of wrangling; not with the two Win 7 PCs on the same network to talk to each other,but through this game.Audio issues (i.e. no audio at all) were apparent on one PC; WASD controls were not registered on one PC; with regards to the networking issues, after finally connecting successfully, a change in server from the host PC required a complete restart of the game from the other PC to even recognise a game; otherwise it just sat there saying ""connected"" and not doing anything on either computer. Another would not even load the splash visual custimisation screen and the only way to play was to hover over the taskbar icon and double tap Enter, which loaded the game in windowed minimal resolution mode. Without sound.Also, the gameplay really sucked. The 90 cents are gone, but the frustration of me and my friends stays with me.2/10, it's not even worth 90 cents on Steam and writing this review was a catharsis."

It is ABSOLUTELY GREAT co-op fun, for your friends, kids, anyone. This game is in fact a great training in co-operation. I am playing it with my almost 6yo son and we have A LOT of fun. Sure, there are some much harder to beat levels, but overall... I higly recomment this game. GOOD JOB !"

Really interesting mechanics that actually emphasize working with a partner. Is coop only so its also nice that it gives you a free copy of the game with purchase to give to a friend.

It can take a few tries for the other person to be join the game.  This game requires a lot of coordination between the two players.  It helps if you have a voice chat going while playing.How hard or easy this game is really depends on what rooms you initially get.  Some are relatively easy, and other can take many attempts to get right.  For example, one room has a bull where both players are wearing ""attention hats"".  When you turn a hat on, then it will charge at you.  You turn it off before it gets to you and get out of the way for it to kill stuff for you.  The trick in this room is for each person to take turns calling the bull.  Once you have it down, it feels a bit like a coordinated dance.  Even so, the final two bugs that need to be killed by the bull are tricky since you do not have much space to navigate in the last area for that room.  My friend and I died several times before we finally got through that room.Once you get through five rooms, you get to an intermediate area and then can do the next route.  At first the routes are randomly chosen, but once you do enough rooms, you can start to choose the path you take.  Each room is fairly unique in requiring different types of coordination.  Some rooms have more of a puzzle nature figuring out the right sequence to get through the room, while others require more team coordination.Overall, for what this game is, it is pretty good.  It is only for playing with one other person online, preferably someone you know and can work easily with."
