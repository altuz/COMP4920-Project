The levels are simple and short, but if you're anything like me you'll be spending hours attempting to minimize your time on every level and get that sweet spot on the leaderboards! Perfect for quick pick up and play sessions but also challenging and deep enough to practice for hours until you're confident enough to beat your friends (and maybe even the world)"

,Recommended,271670,9593452,"Posted: 22 March, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"Short, responsive, sweet and pricey. Just some keywords to describe 10 Second Ninja. You have 10 seconds to clear a level by defeating all of the enemies. You start with some simple platforms, but a few levels later the game will introduce something new. Falling pillars and portals to name a few. It requires speed, skill and a clear head. I think I would describe the game as a puzzle platformer, even if it's more action focused than you would think. There are 5 worlds to complete, and each world has about 8 levels I think. But I think it took me less than an hour to complete all 5 worlds (ok, ok, I didn't clear every level with 3 stars) so it's pretty damn short. But man, is it good. Normally I'd say that if you enjoy a game the price doesn't really matter. But it's hard to justify the price for this game just because it's so freaking short.So, let it be for now and grab it when it's on sale, or at least costs €5 or less.[Rating: 78/100]"

,Recommended,271670,11110007,"Posted: 6 July, 2014",all,Heartview,"I have a few things to say about the game so I'll do a Pros vs Cons list first.ProsFast pacedPretty tight controlsEasy to pick up, difficult to masterCHALLENGINGSimple (read effective) graphicsGood sound designConsShortA bit pricey (related directly to above con)Maybe lacking a few featuresNow I consider myself to be a veteran when it comes to platforming games like this. I have completed n, Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy, I wanna Be The Guy/Boshy all in their entirety, as well as a slew of other action platformer games. And I easily consider 10 Second Ninja to be up there as one of my favorites. It's a game with a realtively simple concept: Kill all robots on the map using either a close range sword or long range shuriken projectiles, all without dieing in as little time as possible. Easy enough to understand, but the level the game is played at makes it a deceptively difficult. The timing for a lot of the levels requires near perfect jumps and accuracy to get 3 star ratings on, and posting higher leaderboard scores requires nearpixel perfectaccuracy and timing. There is a real challenge here hidden behind the easy to understand controls and mechanics. If you enjoy a good challenge in your platformers, don't skip this game. While not masochistic by any means, any self-respecting action platformer fan needs this game under their belt.Now the controls for this game are also pretty good, with great response time. My only gripe with some of the controls comes from slight issues like corner bumping. Landing too far off the edge on the corner will not let you stand on the ledge, however a second mid-air jump can still be performed after falling off even if both jumps were used prior to landing, meaning the game registers that you have hit the ground already. In a game where pixel perfect accuracy comes into play, this might get a tad annoying on some levels, though it is a bit difficult to notice. It can also be difficult to gauge throwing shurikens along the ground as the hitbox for it is a bit strange. This is really a non issue, but sometimes a shuriken will hit the wall at a corner, and other times it will slide across the ground as you wanted it to. I say it is a non issue because honestly, it comes down to how precise you are when throwing it in the first place, so it becomes more of an issue ofwhen you throw itrather than the game registering the hitbox badly. So in reality, its just a small visual gripe rather than an actual game issue. Otherwise, the controls are incredibly responsive and tight. A real pleasure to play as the game feels like its actually listening to what you tell it to do.The sound design, while not much to note, is effective and aestheticly pleasing. No over the top speaker destroying sound bytes, just simple, effective sound design. Love it.Now I listed 3 cons, however this boils down to really just one, and perhaps more of a reccomendation for future development. My only real con with this game is the current $10 price tag, for a pretty short game that can be completed in one sitting. No end game content, no unlockables, which means the only thing keeping you playing the game after beating the final level is getting better personal times, and ranking up on leaderboards. And with the few levels provided, should be quite a bit of replayability, though I would still say the game lacks girth. However, this issue would be remedied entirely by a user level repository, and obviously the ability to make your own levels. Now do I think the price tag is too steep? Not at all. I have payed more for less before, and given how awesome this game is, it is well worth it. More of a passing thought rather than a real issue to be fair.As for any lacking features, it really boils down to adding in a level builder for users (Steam workshop integration would be awesome, a la Battleblock Theatre) and possibly adding in individual level leaderboards, though I could see how that would just be more confusing given that times come down to differences in 100th of a second resulting in long lists of the exact same time on down the leaderboard.So in conclusion to my lengthy review of a rather short and simple game, I would absolutely reccomend the game to anyone, completley ignoring any small cons I might have found. Action platformer fans, if you don't already have it, get it. The games length and price is no excuse to not take part in the robo-nazi slaughterfest by the hands of a twitchy ninja. You are the only hope little man, save us from those Evil mecha-nazis. I heard they hate kittens!"

The only downsid is, that a normal jump(you can double jump) has always the same height.Maybe it is not necessery for this game, I will know when If could need it.The price is a bit high compared to other Indiegames, but since it was released yesterday I think it's okay.Also I can't judge the price fairly before I played it a bit longer.Short: If you have the money, like the really fast gameplay, and like to redo things often to get better: Buy it.###EDIT###Completed the game in 10 hours. 10 hours for a 400second game, huh ;)Definitely worth buying, the feeling you get when you miss the needed time by only 0.02 seconds several times and the happiness, when you finally did it."

In this fast-paced platformer, your aim is to clear every single level in less than ten seconds - that is, kill every robot on the screen, using your weaponry and triggering environmental hazards. Aim for the lowest possible time to earn a three-star rating!The concept is really nice, and the par times are very tightly balanced. Finding the optimal route for each level will require meticulous planning, and the execution leaves no room for error.It is incredibly satisfyingwhen you nail your inputs perfectly and maximize a route's potential, and deeply unnerving when even then, you're still half a second too slow; reconsider what seems obvious, think outside the box and, most of all, keep optimizing your inputs. The original core concept, the precise controls and meticulously balanced level design are the game's main strenghts.Now for the cons. The visuals and cutscenes are entirely forgettable, which can be excused in a low-budget indie game such as this. The soundtrack, albeit repetitive, serves its purpose but isn't particularly memorable either. My main criticism would be thatthe game is really short, and perhaps not quite as ""hardcore"" as it may appear at first. I was a little disappointed to hit the ending credits after only a few hours (plus maybe an extra half hour on the bonus world), with all the three-star ratings earned and without hitting any major roadblocks.I would have loved more content, and I felt that certain ideas in the level design could have been further developped (portals, falling/crumbling blocks, etc). As it is, I can't say that the game has exploited its potential to the fullest; nevertheless, it remains a solid puzzle platformer and one of the most execution-intensive games I have played in a while, with relatively fair content for its price. A shame that such an interesting challenge turned out so short."

,Recommended,271670,12414362,"Posted: 8 October, 2014",all,nO_d3N1AL,"A simple but ingenious idea for a game. The controls are extremely fluent, and the game takes about 10 seconds to pick up and play, and perhaps 10 minutes to get the hang of it. It combines puzzle with speedrunning in the most fundamental kind of way. The fact that each level is about 5 seconds long and restarting is instant means it's not frustrating or off-putting. This is perhaps its greatest strength - that by having extremely short levels, the execution becomes much more important. Timing jumps and movement perfectly to shave off milliseconds is something you'll be doing a lot right from the beggining - and this is, in essense, what speedrunning is all about. Games with longer levels and deeper mechanics are so complex that most players never really reach the point of searching for an extra few milliseconds to hit the target time because most players don't have the time to practice perfecting their run of a level longer than a minute - and thus, they lose out on the excitement of time trials. This game is extremely accessible and fun to play, and clearly demonstrates the appeal of speedrunning to any non-gamer. Would highly recommend for perfectionists. Also, the ahcievements are awesome."

At first glance (as well as when you play it) the concept seems more geared to be a mobile game than a PC game. However, the pacing is more fitting of a PC/console game. Completing each level in 10 seconds or less is not hard at all, even if you aren't used to fast paced games. With practice, avoiding spikes and falling objects becomes easy. The real challenge is getting 3 stars on every level, which can take some time.If you are considering buying it, ask yourself this: ""Am I going to try to 100% it?"" If the answer is no, you aren't going to get much out of the game. Playing through each level only once won't take much time, and is especially not worth $9.99 in that regard. If you are a completionist (or are for just this game), definitely pick up the game, but still at a discounted price. I only heard about it and bought it because I crafted a 90% off coupon for it (s***, it was 99 cents!). At that price, it was definitely worth it.Of course, getting 3 stars on every level is often brutally difficult, and at times frustrating. You will have to time your jumps and attacks perfectly , which will take loads of trial and error (and error and error and error). This is a turn-off for a lot of people, but a selling point for others. It is entirely dependent on whether you enjoy fast-paced games or not. Completing each level with 3 stars left me saying ""Damn, I can't believe I just did that, let's do the bonus levels!"" and not ""Wow, I just wasted 5.8 hours on that?"".In the end, the question I ask myself is ""Did I have fun?"". Yes. A lot of it. There were some levels that were just frustrating (I'm looking at you Deathcube Level 1), but most of them were a blast to complete. Definitely pick it up when it is discounted if you enjoy fast-paced games or are looking for something new to try."

Lots of levels but I cant get more stars because I am not very good. Cool game thoughThe graphical engine is nothing to write home about here - only the most basic technology is involved however it accomplishes what it set out to do - when you consider that the controls are lightning fast responsive and that the game is buttery smooth it all comes down to gameplay. The best comparison would be Super Meat Boy, but instead of navigating grueling mazes of traps with twitch reactions you have 10 seconds to hit a number of targets across the screen. The failure screen is quickly skipped allowing you to chain-attempt the level without breaking any sense of continuity which really helps with the flow of the game. Given that I am not a great at platformer I am not the best suited to evaluate this but I can feel myself tense up and get drawn into the game and I can tell that there is a solid enough formula that this one indie platformer does earn its place in a proper gaming library.I would recommend this one"

Good move speed and jump height, sword attack has nice range, shruikens are decently fast, double jump really helps out, and each area has a few gimmicks of its own to keep things fresh.The main problem is that, well, the game is super short.

And that's, really, the sticking point for me. I quite enjoyed my time with this game, it was a ton of fun. This kind of thing is right up my alley. But for the asking price, combined with the presentation equivalent to a flash game, I would *not* recommend this game at its full price. Half off, maybe. 66% off is what I got it for and even that feels a bit too high for me, but considering that I did enjoy most every moment I spent with the game I suppose I can't complain too much. It's designed well, the 3 star times are fairly realistic when you figure out the expected route, and the fact that everything is so quick helps too since you're never losing more than a few seconds of progress with every failure (or a few minutes in hard mode, but that's usually more than one failure to fail the target time...)So yeah, if you want a good fast-paced platformer with an emphasis on speedrunning, and you don't care about the price, pick it up for sure.

Very easy to pick up and yet this game is extremely challenging if you are attempting to gain three stars on every level.The game is divided up into worlds, each with several standard levels that lead up to a 'world boss' fight which must be unlocked by achieving enough stars on the previous levels. Every level, including boss fights, must be completed in under ten seconds, hence the name.This isn't normally too taxing - the difficulty comes when attempting to either gain stars or to achieve a better time in order to get into the top 50 leaderboards.The comedy in the cutscenes is fantastic - the premise being that 'Robot Hitler' and a legion of baddies are planning world domination and one little ninja is all that stands in his way.Easy to pick up and put down.

The game doesn't recognise controllers on many PCs. The devs are aware of this and are working on a fix, but to release a game based on twitch reflexes like this and have the controller support that bugged is a complete mistake on their part.2. The game eats memory like I eat Chinese food at a buffet. Why is a game that looks like a Flash game from 2005 using 400MB of RAM? Why does it stutter and lag on my computer? My computer can run Super Meatboy just fine, but this game has to be dropped to the lowest resolution in windowed mode to run smoothly. On better computers, this is probably not an issue, but a game like this should be able to run well on a computer from 4 years ago - heck, it should be able to run well on a computer from 10 years ago.3. This game is not worth 7.99€. The amount of levels is staggeringly low. I've played the game for 2 hours and am almost at 100% on all the levels except the locked bonus stage. Either the devs thought people would struggle more to get through stages that it would take longer, or they honestly thought the game has enough content to justify 7.99€. It does not.I get that the devs are independant, probably don't have a lot of money, and are trying to make some money to work on bigger projects, I totally understand and respect that, but as a consumer, 7.99€ is not a price I would pay for a game this short with so many problems. The devs say they're trying to fix things, and if the issues go away I will gladly change the review to positive (even despite the shortness), but until then, I'd have to advise people to not buy this game."

A few youtube videos showed gameplay that looked kind of fun, but the actual game itself is kind of buggy and poorly designed. I heard someone compare it to Super Meatboy, and I can only assume they meant the newgrounds flash version rather than the much more polished game available on Steam.Also, a few times, it felt like my route was sufficient to get three stars, and it eventually did, but it fell short of a tenth of a second the first time. It's a very tight game with somewhat unforgiving controls. For example, I swear I should be able to jump at point A but no, I need to wait a twentieth of a second before jumping.In short, it tries to be a Super Meatboy-esque game, but Super Meatboy was very polished, while as this feels more like something some guy just made in Game Maker. It COULD be a Super Meatboy level game, conceptually, but it just lacks that same level of polish."

As the name implies, 10 seconds to beat the platform challenge as a Ninja.Although it seems easy and you can actually complete it within minutes, you'll end up wanting to perfect the stages with 3 star ratings. Great for those after a challenge at finding the quickest route to clear. However, little replay value once you cleared it fully, other than attaining impossible times for scoreboard."

If blowing up masses of nazi robots in 10 seconds of ninja action sounds like a good way to blow the afternoon, this game is for you. Not for the clinically serious gamer. Let's take a lookThe graphics are pixelated, but look well enough. You'll find most of the enemies look the same, but the graphics are not the main point. The music is fine enough, but you'll be heading to the options to turn it off after half an hour or so, as the track can get repetitive.The gameplay is the real action here. Your task is to destroy all the ninja nazis in your vicinity within ten seconds. This can become quite easy, but when you realize that for all three stars you need to do that in what is about one-third of this time, strategies begin to develop. It can be quite fun to find new ways to go around a level faster to defeat all of those pesky nazi robots. However, some levels begin to boil down to simple quick reactions, which can easily become frustrating after retrying a level ten times because you're one-tenth of a second short each time. However, the sense of accomplishment after finally winning is great.There is no story other than the fact that you are a ninja and there are evil nazi robots and you must kill them.So would I recommend it? If you haven't seen the big blue thumbs-up, then I would say yes. The gameplay is fun, as you feel great after defeating five nazi robots in three seconds. The music is no problem, and neither are the graphics. If you're looking for a quick, humerous, reaction-based puzzle game, then this is for you."

,Not Recommended,271670,20496228,"Posted: 12 January, 2016",all,- dan -,10 second ninja is a simple platformer where you are tasked with clearing the enemies from a stage within ten seconds. I enjoyed this game quite a bit until the second world where you begin to need to have cleared the previous stages with a top rating to unlock more levels. This proved to be a brick wall increase in difficulty and after banging my head on said wall for a few hours and making virtually no progress I said ♥♥♥♥ it and deleted the game. frustration vs fun ratio leans so far towards the former that I would hesitate to recommend this game to even the most hardened masochist.Good- tight controls- good conceptBad- progression system leads to great frustrationNot recommended 1/5 could have been so much more
