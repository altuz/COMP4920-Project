My problem is that I have completed the game in 48 minutes.  That includes some interruptions as well.  There is simply not enough content here to justify a game.  At the end, I wondered if I was just playing the demo."
,Recommended,271730,11270260,"Posted: 16 July, 2014",all,murlakatamenka,"So, let me share my thoughts, especially seeing that many red ""Thumbs Down"".""Light"" is a tiny indie game made by just a few people according to the game credits.It's a sneak'n'hack game about an escaped test subject. Controls and gameplay are pretty simple. You sneak using WASD avoiding guards and cameras, can unlock the doors (E), hack (Q), kill guards and civilians (SPACE), hide their bodies (2) and change outfit (3). You will also find and read some documents to understand what happened to you. That's it if I don't miss anything.Gameplay, story, music and minimalistic cyberpunk'ish graphics style are pretty satisfying, I can definitely say I enjoyed them all as well as the game on the whole. Yes, the game is short and won't take much your time to be completed on 100%.Pros:+ Simple controls+ Nice-looking cyberpunk'ish graphics+ Story (despite it might seem typical)+ Soundtrack (special thanks toGavin Harrison!)+ Short (yeah, it's a + as I don't need to put dozens of hours into a tiny game)+ Easy to beat for 100% (apparently, a + for anyone who isn't indifferent to achievements)Cons:- Short (I doubt anyone would complain if the game were longer)- Pricey- Low replay valueI'm literally forced to pay attention to the price. Yes, guys, I agree the game is pricey. I also understand some disappointment and comments and reviews saying ""lack of content"", ""too short"" and agree. Store page is a really promissing one and raises your expectations from the game. My thoughts were like ""Ouch, it's like a mix of my belovedMonaco(50+ hours played) andFrozen Synapse(well-known and highly acclaimed by critics and players), I should check in out"". That's why I've purchased and played ""Light"".However, I don't think the fact the game is pretty expensive (for the content it offers) gives the right to leave a ""Thumbs Down"". I enjoyed this tiny game (I'd especially highlight its music), got a +1 perfect game, learned several new English words (despite it has a Russian localization, I played it in English), didn't invest much time in it and I've also supported indie game developers. I don't regret doing all that and in general cannot say anything bad about ""Light"", that's why - my ""Thumbs Up""!Some notes/recommendations to developers:•Add more content and reduce the price. Seriously. Mentioned Monaco offers you a huge amount of multi-level missions, 8 characters, up to 4 players online co-op, story with its charm and humour as well assoundtrack by Austin Wintory, Steam-features like leaderboards, cloud, Workshop + level editor but is still priced less. Something is wrong here ...• Probably,add more achievements(to pass each level unspotted / under some defined or devs' time / to kill all guards on a level etc). At least it will increase players' playtime and will add some challenge. This point completely depends on your attitude to achievements and your fantasy/creativity :)• Probably,add Steam leaderboards(competition spirit, you know). I doubt it will be worth doing, but still, that's what comes to my mindP.S. You won't lose anything if you don't play this game, but you will likely enjoy it if you do. And Steam is not the place where you can complain about the price. Even just released games are offered literally tomorrow with a good discount (my example: boughtAsteriathat was released a bit more than a week ago with a -75% coupon received for badge crafting). Countless bundles popup almost every day. You're warned multiple times about the price and content mismatch, so you are free to buy the game when it's on sale or comes to a bundle. Then you'll be more prone to share some love with ""Light""."

The enemies don't move in wholly predictable patterns, they have a degree of randomness that makes the game more of a adventurous that you normally want from a stealth game.Stealth games normally let you plan things out, and let you duplicate your route if you die. This game prevents that sort of careful planning. Instead you're flying by the seat of your pants.Fun, but I wish some small issues would get touched up."

Wireframe offices and iconic guards and civilians. Mostly you have to deny the guard's viewfields, hack doors & cameras over a terminal hack, collect items, place intels and find the exit of a level. But you can also knockdown all guards and get 1-2 min timelimit to search the now harmless level until the reinformances arrive. I prefer the brute method to go faster."

That wouldn't be a problem if the experience packed into that hour was socks-rockingly great. But it's not - it's aggressively mediocre in all aspects but soundtrack.The story is eye-rollingly unconvincing in the same way that kid at school whose dad totally worked for Nintendo was unconvincing. Worse, it's told clumsily (e.g. confidential project journal entries printed out and scattered in the company's lobby, to name one of the less stupid moments). The gameplay looks interesting, but in the absence of level design to hold it together ultimately boils down to ""run around, tap at yellow things, avoid red things"". The guard AI is dull and seems to have been rostered from extremely nearsighted personnel who all forgot to bring their contact lenses to work. The ""hacking"" looked cool in the trailer but does not actually lead to any interesting possibilities, instead acting as a red-key-blue-key-green-key series of hotspots.The soundtrack is pretty good, though."

It's too bad. Still, I won't hesitate to buy the next game from this studio. They have tons of talent and now have very clear feedback on what they need to focus on next time. Seems like a guaranteed hit. Good luck!OLD REVIEW BELOWWow, great game! Why then am I saying don't buy it? Because it's an hour long. It's also not really challenging at all. I failed 3 levels and the rest I passed on my first try. What we have here are a team of great artist, composer, programer and project manager but completely lacking a dedicated or talented level designer(sorry to offend this person). The game just isn't long enough or challenging and without a massive community of mod makers this game is theft at $9. If you can get it for $5, go for it.I will definitely buy the inevitable multiplayer sequel."

Love hiding almost forever and waiting for right moment.Light has interesting and simple visuals, i am ok with it, there is a lot space left for players imagination and i like imaginate :).Light has very nice alectronic ambient soundtrack, i like it.Also Light is very short (no more 2-3 hours if you try to be really stealth and if you do not kill anyone, it is really hard in this case), but i am ok with it too.Light has very nice and interesting story.But stealth in Light, which is primarily stealth game, was a huge dissapointment for me. You can change your suit (aka disguise) for suit of killed civilian or guard. But no matter if you do or not, guards and cameras allways detect you as enemy.You can kill and hide everyone in cabinets, toilets etc., but every time you kill someone a message ""reinforcements arrive in 2:00 minutes"" will pop up, no matter if you kill someone in crowded room or in a lonely place.You can't go ""under"" cameras and stay undetected while staying in place, which is one of basic stealth mechanics.Guards are able see you (even walk!) through opened door if you hide behind them.This is how stealth really should not be done, imho. Someone wrote ""nice idea, terrible execution"" and unfortunately i must absolutely agree. Moreover there are a lot of games which primarily are not stealth, but they are much more enjoyable in stealth than this ""stealth"" game.More than complete game it seems to me like just proof of concept ... but this concept is very very unfinished in this case :(.Conclusion:Overall dissapointed, moreover because this is my first ""not reccomending"" review on Steam.Moreover because i am huge fan of stelath mechanics and stealth games."

Finished the entire campaign in 40 minutes.A fine value for the $1.29 I paid, but absolutely not worth $12.99.The video captures the gameplay well, and the gameplay and play are like Monaco trying to be Metal Gear.It's a better value than an arcade game, so pick it up if you can get it for less than $3."
,Not Recommended,271730,11340285,"Posted: 20 July, 2014",all,Kom,"To begin with, this is a good game.  The gameplay is exactly as they show it, not much more, not any less.  The graphics are alright, as well as the sounds and music.  There's a story there, but it's not anything way over the top, and it's obviously not the focus of the game.  Therefore, if you like what you see in the trailers, than you might like the actual game.Where the issue comes in is the game's length compared to its cost.  At only 12 levels, all but two or three of which can be easily solved in under a minute or two, it's quite possible to see literally all this game has to offer in under a half an hour, even if you don't manage to rush your way through every map.There is obviously much more that could be done with this in terms of content (additional levels, level editor, diverging story paths), and mechanics (more hacking options outside of unlocking doors and disabling cameras, additional enemy types or obstacles) which people may come to expect from such a game, but the developers chose to keep it simple, and I don't feel misled.All in all, it's a good game, and it plays as expected, it's just far too short, especially considering the current price."

It has a great aesthetic which is simple but really cool at the same time. The gameplay can be challenging at times, particularly if you are trying to go quiclkly through the game, and the story is fairly compelling - I found it very interesting to actually read all of the story related parts. Also, the game has some great music and sound effects.While I do think this game is a lot of fun, it is extremely short; you will likely only get an hour or two out of it, unless you want to redo levels to try and get a higher score. Due to the length of the game, some people probably won't think the price is worth it, which is fair enough as it is fairly expensive for the amount of time you can really spend in the game. I think with the addition of a level editor or something along those lines would make it well worth the cost for anyone however, since the game itself is as I said quite good, just very very short.If you want to see some gameplay, here's a link to a quick 2 minute long video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8n_YASVsrcAnd if you would like a more indepth look at some later levels without any story spoilers, here's a link to a more detailed video that is approximately 15 mins long:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9fBf2yHC1Q&feature=youtu.be"

However I can understand the curve being a bit of a sharp increase, given how few levels there are.I was left a bit nonplussed at the end, when it abruptly cut to credits without any closiure as to whether my actions saved the world after all.I would still recommend this game though as it was entertaining."

It looks pretty and the idea is nice, but it just doesn't seem....finished. The basic gameplay is an obvious rip-off of the likes of Hotline Miami and Third Eye Crime...but there are some stupid flaws in the ""finished"" product.First of all, the game can be finished in about 45 minutes. £9.99 for that? That's ridiculous. I know that we shouldn't judge games based on their length, but surely this is pushing their luck...Secondly, there are some curious flaws in the guards motion. It's tricky to predict their movement because you watch one, and he turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left...so you follow him, and he turns right and shoots you. There is NO warning he's going to do that. In addition, it seems very hit-and-miss whether they can see through things like chairs (and yes, I know about the windows - that one was obvious)Thirdly, some of the gameplay features don't seem to make any sense. If you kill someone, the guards are alerted immediately, even if there's nobody else in the area. You can hide the body, but it doesn't make any difference at all to what happens next. You'd expect the guards to take longer to find you...or perhaps the timer doesn't start until someone finds the body? If you kill someone you're given the option to swap clothes, but again, it doesn't seem to do anything. Camera still detect you, guards still shoot you on sight....so why bother?There's a good game here...and I'll be interested when it's finished."

Personally I liked the minimalist style, however I can imaine this will not be to everybody's taste...The gameplay is a fairly typical 'stealth-em-up', watching guard patterns, dodging cameras and hacking terminals to unlock doors and disable security... again, there is really not much else to say as this has been cut down to the absolute essentials. The objectives for each level are clearly marked in the upper right hand corner of the screen and the plot unfolds through on-screen text conversations and examined documents.Whilst this is a recommendation I would warn potential buyers that I completed the game in under and hour - I could imagine stretching the playtime a little by going back to 'stealth' the levels where I was spotted and forced to kill a guard... but that really wasn't too many.

Unfortunately, that's where the positives end for me.The music was not bad, but nothing to write home about. The writing was rather contrived; it seemed like the story was quickly cobbled together to support a few levels of stealth gameplay and comes to an abrupt, unsatisfying end.The gameplay didn't have much depth to it either. Most guards are easily snuck past. Sometimes you'll want to kill one, as a guard outfit makes circumventing the cameras and other guards significantly easier, and the trade-off of having to deal with the reinforcements never comes into play because the levels are so short that you are done before the reinforcement timer runs out.The hacking portion has no depth to it at all. It's simply a matter of finding the computers and pushing all the buttons, which will open doors, turn off cameras, etc. There's no special gameplay or decision-making involved.All in all, the game falls incredibly short of the expectations set by the price point.PS: Some people are defending the game by pointing to the small size of the development team. Much bigger and better games have been done by smaller teams. Obviously every game's development history is different, and not every team can commit the same time and resources, but they chose to release what barely qualifies as a demo as a full game for 12 bucks -- I feel it's only fair for people to criticize the games flawed aspects and rate it accordingly."

Simple, because it is too short in my opinion.In terms of visuals, gameplay mechanics, etc, The game is fantastic as I like stealth games. It doesn't really look like anything else in my opinion. Had they added more levels, or an ability to build your own levels, then i would definately change this to thumps up. They could easily add this game for modding, because then this game could become more than what it is."
76561198003565373,Recommended,271730,13817059,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,[GAW] Luuna,"I got this game as it was remembering me Frozen Synapse/gunpoint, games I enjoyed a lot, with stealth elements.I was really looking into it. I read some reviews which let me down at first but I jumped in to check for myself.Pros:-Art: I do like the blueprintish 2D view from above.-Controls: Controls respond well.-FPS: The game is running well without any problem on my Nvidia 580.-Stealth: Stealth is efficient, you need to stay out of the vision of the guardc and cctv.This is rather easy most of the time (if you get a guard outfit the vision of all the enemy gets reduced by 2, it is then very easy to get out of sight of everybody)-Punishment: If you get caught, depending where you are of course but there is a high probability that the guards will find you and one shoot you. This is good as its avoid the raise alarm run all over the place and everybody gets reset asap. As the level aren't that big it is ok to die.-Level design: The level aren't very big, which is good when you die and have to restart at the beginning.Cons:-Art: It takes time and trial to understand some of the object (like windows took me 10 run to see the difference and why that guard was seeing me despite being inside a room).-Doors: As soon as you get too close from a door it opens automaticaly, it is annoying if you want to peek inside and see the most of the room.-Kills: All the time, the only option is killing the guard and ""innocent people"" ? Despite the description of the game saying ""Stash unconscious guards in cupboards"", if I kill them, they will be dead and not unconscious.-Story: The story will be forgot as soon as you close the game, even the mission objectives lack excitment sometimes and it's a little all over the place.-Hacking: The prologue was not clear on one point. When you hack a terminal, you can access the item unlocked at anytime and you don't have to stay near the terminal you hacked.I quite enjoyed the game but it lacks on several points.Specialy when it comes to time. It took me an hour and a half to go through all the game, I have seen reviews which indicate they closed the game in under an hour)The story isn't memorable, I was reading it but just to be sure I wasn't missing anything. You won't play for the story (better for you to play gunpoint if you want something similar with a bit more of story and being able to choose your path in it).I do like to compare game to movie when it comes to price as this is, for me, interactive entertainements.For about a bit more than an hour I would expect the price of the game to be similar to a movie theatre ticket (around 7/8euros in France), I got the game on sale for 6euros which suits me well.I do recommend the game despite being so short. It was fun to play it.This game is probably for people who love stealth game and want a game that can be finish in the evening.Luuna."
,Recommended,271730,25025176,"Posted: 19 August, 2016",all,OdatNurd,"As many other reviews are probably stating, Light is a very short game. It took me roughly 2 hours to complete the game end to end and that's probably because I like to take my time in this sort of game and not try to speed run everything.That said, it's entirely a personal matter if the price of the game and how much play time you get out of it matters to you or not; if it does, maybe pick it up on sale?In any case, everything in the game seems very smooth and polished. The controls seem quite tight and the minimal graphics really work well in this sort of game and seems to make sense. You can disguise yourself as a guard but will still be seen if you get too close, which makes sense (guards know who other guards are close up), guards notice when people are killed, and so on.The story in the game is not super great (at least to the degree that it's fleshed out), and it really just cries out for a level editor. This sort of feels more like a tech demo or a game where the users are meant to create the content more so than a fully realized game.Regardless of all that, if you're a fan of stealth games, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up (at a price point that seems acceptable for you) just to experience it."

You can't predict anything - which normally is a good thing, but together with bugs (getting blocked by NPCs, people shooting around the corner etc. etc.) you die a lot. A LOT!The achievements... I've never seen less creativity in this essential part of every game!The game is very pricey for its lack of content. I bought it for only $1.30 but in retrospect I shouldn't have spent money on this game.I can only recommend this to people wanting to speedrun this game (8min) or to people trying to stealth through the whole game without getting seen. I don't have the patience (which happens very rarely). I've played this game for 2h, have all the achievements and I'm done."

Both by the original and eye-pleasing art style, and the gameplay, the short length is actually a good point in my case as I’d become bored by the gameplay if it would have gone for the length of several hours.The story intrigued me and kept me entertained during the whole span of the game, although it isn’t very complex. (The premise is interesting, though) Here again the short gameplay time helps the game as if it went longer the story would become stretched out. Speaking of the story in it lays my only negative about the game.The open ending, who likes open endings?"

Not groundbreaking, but simple and executed well enough.But the game can be 100% completed in under a half hour on your first try without much effort. And the game doesn't really introduce any new mechanics past the first level or two. Probably worth less than $2.There were also a few technical problems. I changed it to windowed and lowered the resolution and the game crashed, and the error message that popped up kept taking focus away from every other program, including task manager. Had to alt+f4 it. Worked fine after that point."
