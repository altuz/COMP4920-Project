76561198113629964,Recommended,271860,12783639,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,Aborsive Extralogical Shrievalty,"So this will be my second review of the game. Hope you guys find it helpful and if so, a thumbs up would be appreciated, thanks. :D--------------------Scoring Guide1 - 3 Terrible4 - 6 Decent7 - 9 Good10 Perfect--------------------So after writing my first review,  I had a chat with the Dev (which you can see in the comments below) and decided to put a little bit more time into Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection. I booted up the game, played all of the modes, killed all the things, and now feel like I have my review to write.[Gameplay] 8/10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So the Gameplay is rock-solid, the best thing about this game in my humble opinion. There are Three different Ships to choose from. The first being average damage and average area of attack, The second having a lower damage but higher area of attack, and a Third with higher damae but very small area of attack. They all felt very good while playing them. I did find the higher area of attack to be the best one, although this may just be personal opinion. If i had one complaint about the Ships would be the lack of a boost/quick dash button. Sometimes I feel like that would help things out a ton, and would add a nice other level to the game. Deffinetly not needed, but I would have liked to see one none the less.You do have bombs, like in most other games in this genre, and they work the same way. I'm not 100% on if you can refill the bombs, it may have said something in the tutorial that I missed, but other than that I did not find a way to.The main difference in this and others in the genre is the math. ""Destruction is just part of the equation"" is exactly what it sounds like. In certain game mode, there are numbers that will fall down, such as 7+, a few seconds later another will fall, such as 5, Lastly 3 other numbers will fall, one of them being the answer. You must solve the problem and you will get a multiplier to your score. I will say, as I did in my first review I am not a fan of this. It is not bad, and it is well done, I just am not a fan.As in game modes, this game has quite a few for an indie title.You have your regular mode, as well as an easy mode in which it will automatically use one of your bombs after you get hit.Time Attack pits you against the clock, and gives you a max multiplier at the start. Doing the math in this mode will give you +30 seconds to the clock, which I actually like alot more than the regular mode, not sure why it just ""feels"" better to me. Personal opinion I guess.Lastly you have a survival mode, which has no math, you have one life and max multiplier.The game modes are well varried, and you can play around with them and find your favorite.So I'm not sure weather to put this under Gameplay or Design but  think it may go best here. I did have trouble seeing the numbers sometimes while playing. As this is a bullet hell type game, I won't say this is a huge problem, and it may be just me, but i felt like sometimes i got ""cheated"" out of the correct answer because of so much stuff going on on-screen. Again this may just be me and being bad at the game, but if I had one major gripe about the gameplay this would be it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Design] 8/10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The design of the game is pretty good for an indie game. All of the menue's look and feel fine while navigating them, and the particles are actually very well done for an indie game.Now let me make it clear that there are better looking indie games out there, but Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection looks just fine, no complaints here.The enemy ships while being generic are varried in design, and while I only reached the 2nd level, I will say I do find a certain charm in the enemy design. I would like to play farther, just to see what else the game has in store for me. Bosses are the same way, although I will say I only reached the first one as I did not beat the second level. Again I would like to get farther, just to see some of the other boss design. :D---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Music/Sound] 6/10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The music in Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection is solid. The intro had me hyped from the very beggining. It is a metal/rock track and gets you ready to blow some♥♥♥♥♥♥up.There are a total of 5 tracks and they are all prety good, tho not amazing. They seem to get quite repetitive, quite fast, and would have liked to have seen a different type of music in the actual game. You can switch tracks in game with the press of a button, which i greatly appreciate as not enough games do this. All in all I would say the music, while good, is the weakest part of the game.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Conclusion] 7/10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------All in all I feel like Super Killer Hornet: Ressurection (love the name by the way :D) is a very well made indie game and deffinetly, if you are a fan of the genre, worth your time and money. For the fair price of $4.99 I would deffinetly recommend this title.Thanks for reading doods."

I got it on sale for $6.99 and it feels a bit much for something this barebones. I would have loved to see the game support higher resolutions, to me that omission is a dealbreaker."

,Recommended,271860,11798142,"Posted: 20 August, 2014",all,Professor Icepick,"It's a little rough around the edges, but Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection is actually an interesting idea. Take old-school shmup action and throw in some math problems in order to increase your multiplier and power up your ship. The game itself is short, with only 6 stages, but it's a single-sitting game, which makes it infinitely replayable. After beating the game on ""Auto-Bomb"" difficulty, which is effectively the game's standard difficulty, I've found myself mostly replaying in Survival mode, which is an interesting change of pace. There's also a Time Attack mode, with three difficulty settings, which puts you on a limited timer, which can only be refilled by completing math equations correctly. Playing Time Attack mode on Survival difficulty is a pretty fun time killer, once you've completed the game's main campaign.The graphical style seems to invoke old-school DOS games in my opinion, which is a welcome change of pace compared to most retro-inspired aesthetics, which go for an 8-bit NES look.All-in-all, I'd have to say SKH:R is definitely worth the $5 Flump Studios is asking for. I'd definitely recommend it."

,Recommended,271860,14043877,"Posted: 17 January, 2015",all,SolumnMushroom,"I just... Where do I begin with this one?  You get 2 games for the price of 1 cheap game, so I'll break down this review accordingly.  Please bear in mind, I got this game for $0.50.  Let's begin.The original game feels like it's trying to be something it's not, and that is a touhou game.  If you don't know what a touhou game is, look it up online.  It want's to be one, but isn't.  The overall concept is sound enough, but I'm not sure who their intended audience is.  To get power-ups, you need to correctly solve relatively simple math problems.  So is it ment to be an educational game?  If that's the case, it's far too edgey for practical classroom use, and far too difficult for at-home use by the average pre-schooler.  Overall, it's not bad, it's just misguided.  It's trying to bridge to completely unalike genres, and it fails to do so.  Does that make it a bad game in it's own right? No, or at least, I don't think so.The main game you buy is Resurrection, and it suffers from the same problems as the first, with some more fluid controls, better graphics, and even SIMPLER math.  I know math is a core element of the franchise, but it really doesn't belong in a shoot-em-up.  Also, british rock for the main soundtrack?  Odd choice, but at this point, we're far beyond the point of random.  It fits, nonetheless.  Overall, better than the first, but I'm still mixed about it.  Not that it's a bad game, it just doesn't define it's place very well.For the both of them together, you won't be disappointed.  The gameplay is solid, the controls fluid, and the soundtrack will leave you rocking out for a while at least.  The core fundamentals are unique, but slightly awkward.  Don't let that distract you.This game gets my Seal of Approval.  Pick it up the next time it's on sale, or if you're genuinely curious."

If your looking for a shmup that reinvents the wheel and all that stuff steer clear of this game and let me know if you find it because a great shmup has been on my wishlist for a while.

,Not Recommended,271860,12404664,"Posted: 7 October, 2014",all,Skeptical Minotaur,"Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection (SKH:R for short) is a game developed by Flump Studios. A bullet hell shooter that originally destined for XBox Live eventually made it’s way onto Steam. I originally was going to write a review for Danmaku Unlimited 2, but this game caught my attention and I decided to try something new first.Starting with the good, SKH:R is a decent shoot em’ up (shmup for short). Controls are alright, but the hit-box for the ship and bullets can get dodgy at points in the game. The game isn’t as hard as other bullet hell shooters or shmups, making it a good entry point for someone who wants to get into the genre.The way you power up your ship is a bit annoying. In the midst of shooting enemies and dodging bullets you have to a number ranging from 1 to 11 with a math sign next to it (+, - , / or x), then grab another number (again 1 through 11), then grab the correct answer. Answering correctly powers up your ship, an incorrect answer will power down your ship. Rhythm Destruction had this same issue of distracting the player from the gameplay. Not only do you have to dodge bullets, you have to focus on picking up two numbers, solving an equation, then finding the corresponding answer in the onslaught of bullets. However unlike Rhythm Destruction, this style of powering up feels tacked on and isn’t fully integrated into the gameplay as one would hope. The gameplay is solid, but the overall look of the game lacks polish.While I wish a bit more polish went into the final product, it is a decent schmup. At $4.99 it's a good beginners introduction into the schmup / bullet hell genre (or for someone who likes a retro game look), however for die-hard lovers of the genre I would pass for other games in the genre at the same price point.See more of the review at:http://www.skepticalminotaurgames.com/super-killer-hornet-resurrection"

,Not Recommended,271860,9818479,"Posted: 14 April, 2014",all,Goldenkitten,"Did you ever want to play a really lackluster Shmup while solving grade-school math? Congratulations you just got your wish.The idea isn’t a horrible one, but the implementation is less-than-stellar to say the least. The sprites and action feel less “retro” and more just “cheap” with a dodgy hit-box, underwhelming visuals (some of the enemy designs are creative, but the actual quality is iffy), and bullet patterns that feel like they were tossed in at random.This would be bad enough but the whole unique selling point of solving math equations feels like it was shoehorned in at the last moment. Not only are they dreadfully simple; rarely being more than fifth-grade multiplication, but the whole system feels like an afterthought rather than what the game was built around. You can play with the math system off if you wish, but take it away and you’re left with the subpar bullet hell I described above. Definitely can’t suggest it.Note: As for the music I’ll leave that one up to you. You can play with the music you hear in the trailer or a more traditional soundtrack. The traditional one is a very generic, if working, shmup soundtrack. The licensed songs are much more a matter of taste being a very niche-genre so if you like what you hear in the trailer then you’ll probably like the other ones on offer. Or vice-versa."

Too bad it doesn't have co-op mode that would double the fun atleast. I bought this game knowing that it has full support controller, but unfortunately it doesn't support it :(. well atleast the BGM is good, plus it has classic soundtracks well done flump studios you made a pretty damn hard game."

First the Music is just annoying. Then you will have to do math during the game to keep your chain up. You are playing with some spaceship thing and you will kill enemies. From time to time you will see numbers in your screen and matching them will give you a chain. So for instance, What is 5+5?. Nothing against bullet hell games but this game is not even making any sense at all.Terrible Music.Game is overpriced.Have to do more to keep up your chain. What's this? SCHOOL?Meh controls.No replayability.Is boring.Other things.Crashes while alt tabbing.-------------------I Give this game a 2/10"
