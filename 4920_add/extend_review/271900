The number of strategies you need to use to solve the puzzles is incredible and gives the game far more depth than Minesweeper. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this game is if you could not beat the original Hexcells. The puzzles here are brutally difficult, much harder than the original, and some may take you hours to figure out. If you're up for a challenge, you'll find that this game truly hexcells."

It's a whole lot harder than the regular version. There were points where I couldn't find the next logical solution in the puzzle and had to guess. That doesn't mean there wasn't a logical move, just that I couldn't find it! The boards are much bigger and there are added game mechanics that result in more complicated play. It's way more like sudoku, with times when you have make complicated deductions based on the overlap of number clues.If you want a nice, relaxing puzzle game, buy regular Hexcells. If you want a challenge, grab Hexcells Plus. Better yet, both. I think I slightly prefer regular Hexcells just because I like the more relaxing puzzles, but there is a certain sense of accomplishment to be found in Hexcells Plus that regular Hexcells lacks."

They ramp up quicker, and there's an extra mechanic added, so they definitely qualify as more for people who want more Hexcells. If you don't know what Hexcells is, it's a chill puzzle game that's kind of like a cross between Minesweeper and sudoku, and I definitely recommend it."

This is more of an expansion than an actual separate game, but the price is so cheap that it doesn't matter.  Both games are worth far more than the asking price, in my opinion.The music and sound effects are spot-on fantastic, the puzzles are lovingly and painstakingly crafted, and the difficulty progression is just perfect from one puzzle to the next.  Hexcells Plus adds a few things over its predecessor:  additional types of puzzles, a couple of new types of clues, and a bit more difficult end puzzles.I simply cannot recommend both games enough.The mechanics are similar to Minesweeper and if you find yourself clicking the wrong mouse button (like me), you can change the button configuration from the Input tab of the configuration menu when you first start the game.  Also, keep in mind that there is never a time that you must guess.This game makes me feel smart."

The style of gameplay is somewhat similar to ""Minesweeper"" in that you must reveal all the highlighted hexagons based on surrounding clues, but that's where the similarities end...Hexcells:Offers clues horizontally, vertically and diagonallyAlways has a logically constructed solution (random guessing is not required if solved properly).The variety of clues offer more interesting challenges than MinesweeperIn addition,Hexcells Plusoffers further clues beyond the immediate perimeter cellsIs it worth it?If you play the game PROPERLY (ie: no cheating with 'random guesses') and solve each puzzle based on logical deduction, you will find the game deeply engrossing and will find many hours of play.  If however you play it like Minesweeper and click on an unknown cell with a wing and a prayer(!), the game will likely feel unremarkable and no different to Minesweeper (especially as it will permit you unlimited mistakes without penalty).  Since not allowing myself to guess and setting myself the goal of ZERO mistakes, the puzzles have been a huge challenge and really enjoyable."

You had to find the mines and avoid them by marking them. It worked with some clues, since numbers gave away how many mines are close by.The Hexcells games are very similar to it, but they are not working in square blocks, they come in hexagon shape and often remind of chemical combinations when you open the next level. These shapes make it sometimes hard to figure out what is going on and in later levels you get extra clues for the lines of hexagons and stuff like that.playing Hexcells is fun in a kind of weird way. Even if you don't want to make your math homework, you sit down to ""calculate"" the grids, but it is not that much math anyway, more like drawing lines from dot to dot.Later versions of Hexcells (Hexcells Plus & Hexcells Ininite) are basically the same thing on harder levels and Infinite includes an Endless-Mode that let's you play levels created by chance. Start with the normal game and get infected, this game is addictive and you should consider buying the complete pack right from start.10/10 I think I've seen more hexagons than a beekeeper did"

And you get what you order: clever puzzles in the spirit of good old Minesweeper, sans the random guessing element.The difficulty level in Hexcells Plus goes up way quicker than in Hexcells, there are few really easy levels. The more difficult levels can even take up to 30 minutes or so, which started to feel like too much, especially given that you cannot save the game in the middle of a level! Also, it does feel irritating if you make a mistake towards the end of a level after having spent 20 minutes on it, especially if you're after the Perfectionist achievement without cheating.Anyway, the puzzles are hand-made and some actually almost made me laugh out loud when they revealed some perfectly composed, might I say beautiful, hint as to how the blue hexes are set. If you liked the original one, then this offers more of the same, but much more challenge too.

At the time of writing that review, I was unprepared to spend another few dollars on Hexcells Plus. One day Hexcells Plus was on sale, and I figured I should give it a shot, and I'm glad I did.This game is certainly an improvement on the first one and I enjoyed it a lot. The puzzles are a bit harder and some present an actual challenge, particularly if you are disciplined and refuse to let yourself make a blind guess.GameplayThe concept of this game is intriguing, adding a few levels of complication and being much more accurate in the solution than Minesweeper is. No guesses are required, everything can be figured out with logic and enough persistence. Harness your inner vulcan!Some of those complications I mentioned include: cells are hexagons, there are more numbers (rather than just being on the cells they are also found on columns and rows), there are different sorts of numbers (some mean that a string of ""mines"" are all adjacent, others that ""mine"" strings are interrupted by a gap).ControlsVery simple - right click and left click. Still no option in game to change which button does what, but you can change it at game launch. However, by now I've become mostly accustomed to them and didn't make too many stupid mistakes by hitting the wrong button.StorylineNo storyline, doesn't need one.SoundRelaxing gentle zen echoie noises. Also, when you click a cell you get nice tinkling chime-like noises. I don't know why that makes it more satisfying to click on cells, but it does!GraphicsVery crisp, clean, and clear.

This is the same, but... Hexcells is based on the idea of having a clever puzzle game with simple rules. The introduction of the blue tiles that tell you how many other blue tiles are within two hexes, however... It's not a good mechanic. It's not impossible, but it's just not intuitive, especially with the shapes hexes create. You're suddenly dealing with these weird flower shapes where much of the flower is confused by strange colors or parts missing. It's not fun.It's confusing, but not in the way a puzzle should be. It feels like bad design and it comes in very early on. I don't find drawing patterns on the screen to find what I'm supposed to be looking for fun. I'd rather be solving the puzzle than trying to figure out *where* the puzzle is. A simple outline to show where the area is, like was done for the slanted lines in previous games, would have gone a long way.It's not the worst mechanic ever, and I'm sure some people enjoy it, but I personally cannot recommend this game because of it."
,Recommended,271900,14988704,"Posted: 21 March, 2015",all,Admiral Rinj von Scoot,"I really enjoyed the first Hexcells, but my main complaint is that it was far too short. While Plus technically has the same exact number of puzzles, it will last you a whole lot longer--there are new mechanics that make the game far, far more challenging than the first. The same basic gameplay is still here: it's kind of a mashup of Minesweeper and Picross, and it's incredibly satisfying to logically work out all the solutions.If you played the first game,there's two new types of tiles. Black hexes can have a question mark on them; they serve to severely limit the paths one can take to fully solve the board. These end up being an effective way to resolve the primary issue with the game's structure, in that it is otherwise far, far too easy to finish puzzles. The second new mechanic is blue tiles with numbers--the number represents how many blue hexes are present within a two-tile radius. They're great additions; I found them to be a pretty clever way to expand the basic structure of the game.It's absolutely wonderful to have a sequel that provides more of what I enjoyed while also resolving every issue I had with  the initial entry in the series. The first Hexcells honestly just feels like a prototype after playing Plus; I'd still recommend it, but there's no reason whatsoever to play it if you've skipped to Plus. Either way, though, Hexcells Plus is a must buy for anyone who enjoys puzzle games."

This is false. The game is certainly more difficult than its predecessor, but no level actually requires guessing. Some places just requires combining information from two or even three different sources, but those sources are plain to see (though sometimes you have to complete other parts of the level to uncover that information). It's not always easy, but with a firm grasp of the mechanics involved you can always figure out 100% which hexes are what. One of the most fun aspects of the game is finding that logic rather than guessing.If you liked the first game and would not mind a more difficult version, I see no reason not to recommend Hexcells Plus to you."

It's very much like the original ""Hexcells,"" except the puzzle difficulty ramps up immediately (since we already have experience with them from the first game) and the developer added one more puzzle element:  a number in a blue hex indicates the total number of ""hits"" in the surrounding TWO rings of hexes.  That's actually one of my minor complaints with the game:  I kept making silly mistakes because I confused the ""number in the blue hex"" with the ""number in the black hex"" (the number of ""hits"" in the surrounding ONE ring of hexes).I do have to watch my phraseology in these reviews.  In my review of ""Hexcells,"" I said:  ""...still, it would be nice if it were longer.""  Well, the developer listened.  The original game took me 4.1 hours to complete its 30 puzzles with all Achievements.  This game took me 21.1 hours to complete its 36 puzzles with all Achievements.  So, it's absolutely worth the price.  The trouble is that most of these puzzles are MUCH harder (and longer) than those in the first game.  And, since progress within puzzles can't be saved (only the completed puzzle is saved), that leads to puzzle fatigue and even more silly mistakes (clicking the wrong mouse button, black vs blue hex numbers, flat out missing hexes, etc.).  Still, I can't really complain.  This is a really entertaining, worthwhile game.  Recommended."

76561198038132122,Recommended,271900,33534984,Posted: 14 July,all,ForestWolf,"Rating: great (8/10)IntroductionHexcells Plus is a puzzle game where you have to find out behind which cells there are blue or black notes by either right or left-clicking on them. There are multiple different variations of the puzzles with different functions that give you hints on how to solve it. I would call Hexcells a modern version of the classical mine sweeper game.Gameplay & Story: 7/10Same as most other puzzle games, there is no story behind it, but still each new functionality is introduced with a small tutorial, giving you a feeling be being guided. There are quite a lot of different functionalities that spice up the gameplay - blue circles that indicate the area, in which the number of blue cells is given, number for blue cells in a row, indicators for separated or combined cells, question mark cells where you cant know the amount of blue cells next to it and so on. Each level has a different touch, so the design is amazingly well done. Even though im not a big fan of puzzle games since I mostly prefer some action in a game, I definetely enjoyed the gameplay in Hexcells Plus.Combat & Challenge : 8/10The gameplay has an increasing difficulty - it starts off with really simple levels becoming suprisingly challenging at the end. Different functions explained under gameplay topic spice up the challenge even more, but also give you multiple different approaches to the same number of hexes. There were few points where I could not find a definite solution, so I had to take a guess, but still mostly there were mathematical backups where you can count out the chance of which hex is blue.Graphic & Interface : 8/10For a puzzle game the graphic was really smooth and on the point. There were only needed elements, but with a certain level for detail being the level design itself. There is visual feedback for your choice when opening a hex or when making a mistake. The interface is kept so simple, that its stripped of all unnecessary elements.Progress & Mini-Games : 7/10Due to the fact that the game exponentially grows in challenge with higher levels, the progress slows down a lot in ""late game"". This is exactly the sweet spot that any game needs - quick start to grasp the interest of the player and then once you dived in, the progress slows down due to the challenge the game provides.Audio & Immersion : 8/10The music is a soothing composition that combined with the sounds lets you concentrate on the task at hand. The audio feedback gives you yet another confirmation if your choice was correct, so combined with the idea of the puzzles being challenging and the music being really immersive for this game type, it creates an amazing combination to dive fully into this game until you finish at least few levels.Side-NotesThis game is single player only.This game contains steam achievements.This game contains no steam trade cards.This game is fairly short - I finished all the puzzles with Perfectionist achievement (finishing all levels without mistakes by retrying the whole level if you failed one note) in 10 hours play time.This game offers some replayability if you took a longer break from it because you forget the layout of the levels and have to think yourself into it from the start.SummaryI would recommend Hexcells Plus for everyone, no matter if you normally enjoy puzzles or not. It offers a great challenge combined with soothing music, different level designs and great progression curve. It is a fun game to play few levels inbetween and does not take too long to finish completely and for the offered price its a great puzzle game.I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.

However, Hexcells Infinite includes a puzzle generator, where you put in a string of 8 numbers, or have the game randomly pick, and will generate a puzzle based on those numbers, so you can challenge you friends.

This can be both a good and a bad thing. Because of the higher challenge level, I strongly recommend you to first play the original Hexcells.Game has changed little from the original Hexcells. User interface (UI) is exactly the same as before. Just like in Hexcells, you have to deduce whether hexes are blue or black based on simple rules similar to Hanjies and Mine Sweeper. However, the puzzles are completely new. The sequel adds one new mechanic: now blue cells can also have a number on them that dictates how many hexes in two cells' radius are blue. Still no guessing is required at all: everything can be logically deduced.Music has changed a bit but it retains the ambient theme from the original.Just like in Hexcells, there are 36 well-designed, challenging puzzles. Unlike Hexcells, the challenge level jumps up very quickly, and the further you get, the longer the puzzles will take to complete (assuming you are not guessing and strive for perfection). Coming straight from Hexcells it's alright but starting out it would be a bit too much. Especially the new mechanic of numbered blue cells can make it difficult to understand what's going on, though the UI has a convenient helping function to keep your thoughts straight. Unfortunately at least I had to resort to the infamous ""try and exclude"" deduction strategy way more often in this sequel than in the original game, so the puzzles can drag a lot longer. The lack of saving option within puzzles can become a drag if you find yourself in a hurry.I still recommend Hexcells Plus to anyone who liked the original Hexcells and was left craving for more. The upped difficulty level is more hardcore though and I can't emphasize this quality too much. For me the game took some 10 hours to complete fully, while original Hexcells was just a 2-hour stroll. If you want a smoother difficulty curve and a more pleasant a sequel considering the difficulty level, you should skip straight toHexcells Infinitethat also finally adds saves and random levels.In that effect Hexcells Plus shares many problems of its predecessor: it has limited content that lacks replayability after being completed and saving feature before that. However, it also shares most of its virtues: well-designed, albeit (perhaps) too challenging puzzles (when compared to the original one) with pretty much perfect user interface and audiovisual outlook for its game type. For challenge's sake it continues from where Hexcells was left so in that effect it is also a fine sequel for the puzzle enthusiast."

Go through different levels of difficulty and solve all of the puzzles to get to 100%. Can you get every one with no mistakes?Hexcells (apparent from the name) adds new dimensions to the classical game of Minesweeper: More adjacent fields to one hexagon as well as border numbers, which indicate how many fields of the pattern are in a line/row/diagonale. Each boder number can indicate different things, everything is explained within the game. No need to rush things. You are now thinking outside of hexcells.Sound & MusicShallow but fitting background soundtracks and sounds. Nothing special, but that wasn't needed here. The soundtrack and soundeffects change every once and a while when you complete a puzzle.GraphicsDon't expect anything here. The game is primarily a puzzle game, so no high end graphics or effects. The design does its deeds and fulfills its task. Visuals are never irritating and do what they need to do.WeakpointsSometimes, portions of the soundtrack are a little too high-pitched in my opinion. This can get annoying, if you are not used to hearing the same sounds over and over again. They are adjustable ingame though, from soundeffects only to completely mute.Concluding ThoughtsGreat puzzlegame, compelling, challenging, tricky but fair. Nice soundtrack, nice sounds, simple gameplay yet sometimes mindwreckingly hard. Don't worry, if you are the enthusiastic puzzle type of gamer, you will get used to loving this game!"

The board starts with an oddly shaped field made of orange hexagons. Mines are marked by left-clicking a hexagon, turning it blue. Hexagons are revealed by right-clicking, showing the number underneath if you click correctly and shaking the piece and adding a tally mark to your mistake count if you're too hasty in your decisions.Unlike the original Minesweeper, Hexcells is a much more complex game involving a board marked with various different types of clues that give the player hints about how many mines are in each column or in the surrounding area of the board. Hexcells Plus expands upon the original Hexcells by giving players an additional thirty-six puzzles to complete with a couple of added gameplay elements. These elements include the dreaded ?, a marking that denotes a hexagon that has an unrevealed amount of mines around it, as well as numbered mines that indicate how many mines are in a two-piece radius surrounding the hexagon.Unfortunately, the addition of ? hexagons adds a somewhat frustrating element to an otherwise well-balanced game. I often found myself encountering large walls of ?'s that split the board in half, preventing me from continuing on without making a few risky clicks based off some logical guesswork. Altogether, I found Hexcells Plus to be fun, but slightly less enjoyable and more frustration-inducing than the original Hexcells (although that, perhaps, might have been caused in part by the ridiculously long span of time I had been playing Hexcells for by the time I reached some of Hexcells Plus's more challenging levels).Nonetheless, Hexcells Plus is an engrossing way to spend an afternoon. Hexcells Plus can be seen as an expansion to the original Hexcells, adding thirty-six new levels for players to complete, or it can be played as a standalone experience, with the basics of the original Hexcells being explained in the earliest levels of Hexcells Plus. After completing the set of levels contained in Hexcells Plus, be sure to check out the original Hexcells or the inexhaustible Hexcells Infinite, which includes a rather effective level generator and the ability to play user-generated content."

Cheesing in the Cells.Genre: Minimalist Casual Atmospheric Number PuzzlersDeveloped & Published by: Matthew BrownPlatform: Windows, Mac and LinuxBusiness Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by MyselfRead the full & unabridged review about the entire Hexcells Series on A Paladin Without A CrusadeOverall Gameplay ThoughtsHexcells is a minimalist puzzle game that I like to think of as a combination of Minesweeper and Sudoku. A comparison that has probably been made elsewhere. Every level is basically the same. You’re presented with a variable number of cells with a number in the top right corner telling you how many blue cells there are in the puzzle. The challenge is figuring out which cells are blue and which are numbers. If you guess incorrectly, it’s counted as a mistake that will affect how many points you get at the end of a level. The numbers on or adjacent to cells are telling you how many blue cells are connected to them. It’s up to the player to figure out the pattern by examining the numbers. In general terms, if there are two unknown cells connected to a cell that has the number “2” on it, they’re both blue cells. There are several different mechanics used to confuse the player and make them logic out the solution. Upon completing a level, you’ll be rewarded with points that are used to unlock additional groups of levels. As such, this does requires you to complete most of the puzzles with a minimal amount of mistakes in order to progress forward.Hexcells: Plus FeaturesPlus is the expandalone title to the original featuring 36 new puzzles and a some new twists. The main new mechanics is a cell that tells you how many blue cells are in a radius around it. Otherwise, the game is as good as the rest and there are some tricky levels in it. It’s not required to be played but if you haven’t gotten enough Hexcells, this adds some more to theoretically sate that hunger.My Main Issue With HexcellsHere’s the problem I have with the entire Hexcells series. It’s a pretty good puzzle experience, if you play it how it’s intended to be played. However, I feel that they have a problematic design flaw: all of the puzzles can be cheesily completed. If you’re stuck at a certain sequence, you can just click through the rest of the puzzle making as many mistakes as you like. (I had some puzzles at 50-60 mistakes). What about the points you would get from a near perfect completion? Well, once you nearly finish the puzzle, take a screenshot and then instantly replay the level with your own personal guide. It’s possible to win all three games this way without much effort on your part.PC Settings & Audio/VideoIt’s a minimalist game so there really aren’t many settings to change. Since its running on the Unity engine, the Unity launcher menu pops up when you start the game every time. It allows you to change resolutions and turn fullscreen on/off. The graphics quality is set to beautiful and can’t be changed. However, I was able to play this on a basic, five year old laptop running Linux Mint and there was absolutely no trouble running it. Alternative keys can be changed here as well. Hexcells Infinite was the only game of the three that allows you to swap the left and right mouse button functions.Final ThoughtsOverall, I think the Hexcells series is a decently executed puzzle idea with plenty of content. I take issue with the lack of anti-cheat but it's not enough to make it an anti-recommendation. (Thanks to a friend for making a case to change my mind on this). It’s a fun logic number puzzle series. And I did play the three games how it was intended too, with a few exceptions. I had quite a bit of fun deducing the my way through the levels and had several “aha!” moments despite it’s more casual nature. Additionally, it maintains a mellow and atmospheric experience that I can appreciate. While there is the less honorable part of myself thinking “you can just easily ‘cheat’ this game and not spend hours on it”, that doesn't disqualify it from being a decent puzzle game. So, if you can avoid cheating yourself, get the Hexcells series. But if you can’t restrain yourself from looking up help on even the slightest bit of challenge, I probably wouldn't get it. Otherwise, that's my thoughts on this series.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade"

,Not Recommended,271900,21131536,"Posted: 11 February, 2016",all,Holocene - Moving House,"Hexcells plus is a standalone game that's a follow on from the original hexcells. The concept of minesweeper/sudoku is still the core of the game and just like the first one the soundtrack is excellent.The first hexcells managed to achieve a perfect difficulty curve where you never really got stuck for long periods of time which kept the game ticking over and enjoyable. Unfortunately, this one gets too difficult too quickly. There's barely any instruction as to the rules of the game and as this is a standalone from the first one, you shouldn't have had to play the first one to understand the rules.By the time I got to the 2nd set of levels (2/6 through the game) I was already getting stuck for 5-10mins fairly often which just became boring and frustrating. It's not like other puzzle games where if you spend that long you might find a good chunk of the solution which makes the effort rewarding. You can literally spend minutes upon minutes staring to uncover a few more cells only to get stuck again because of how big some of the levels are. Maybe it's the way I play; I know there is always a logical way to move forward in the puzzle so I refuse to guess. But in no way does the game punish you if you do guess. You fail if you guess wrong too many times, but it should be like minesweeper where if you make a single wrong move you've failed the whole level.This is a hard game to give a thumbs up or down; it is very cheap so is worth getting. I think it would be a good idea to buy the other two hexcells and play them first.

This installment is where the rubber met the road for me.If you enjoy games like sudoku, you will find logical puzzles here that work your brain for hours. While a naive comparison, the game plays similarly to a very advanced Minesweeper. By the second act, though, you'll have discovered the futility of that comparison; this game is on an entirely different level and has an elegance in the solutions that random Minesweeper puzzles cannot ever hope to achieve.A couple of the puzzles stumped me for more than an hour, and my roommate rapidly grew tired of me talking the solution out loud as I moved my mouse around. There's a brilliant simplicity to the gameplay and yet, while playing, one must keep a large amount of logic in their head. It's easy to get overwhelmed by logic in one area of the puzzle while overlooking the simple move forward in another area, and the feeling is intense when you slap your forehead in stupidity on discovering it.The soundtrack is quite relaxing, and even after working on the same puzzle for an hour it did not grow tiresome. It's really fun when you get on a ""roll"" of solving the puzzle, too, because you generate little ditties as a reward.The entire Hexcells series contains puzzles that are among the greatest I've ever solved. I highly recommend the entire collection, and also very strongly recommend that you start with Hexcells. It is easier than the other two, this one included, by far. For perspective, I am not the greatest logician, and I invested about 15 hours solving this campaign -- for 15 hours of gameplay, this game is a steal."
,Recommended,271900,34853458,Posted: 9 September,all,100% Hippo,"Hexcells Plus is a great puzzle game, and a great continuation of the first Hexcells game. Much like the first game, the base mechanic is that tiles are either marked blue or give a number representing the number of blue tiles adjacent to them, somewhat similar to minesweeper. But the game takes that base mechanic, adds a few other basic mechanics (number of blue in a column, marking that some need to be consequtive, having some '?' tiles), and builds it into a wonderfully satisfying and relaxing puzzle game. The music is ambient, and actions taken in game generate tones that go with the music as well. All puzzles can be solved without guessing and have a single solution, so when playing, I find it most enjoyable to take my time and only take action when I know it is correct.The puzzles largely pick up where the first game left off. While there is some introduction to the mechanics, it is done in levels that serve to introduce the mechanics while also providing some challenge if you played through the first game. The levels (36 in total) grow in difficulty more quickly than in the first, but even the last few levels, although they can take some time to carefully comb through, remain enjoyable and approachable. The new mechanic, blue cells with numbers that give the number of tiles within 2 blocks, is used well, and makes for neat levels that are just as good, if not better than the levels in the first game. It took me about 7 hours to play through the game originally, and a majority of that time is on the last few, larger, levels (it took me around 40 minutes to do level 35 when I played through a second time, though I probably could have been faster if I'd wanted).All achievements but 'Perfectionist' will be unlocked simply by playing through the levels. 'Perfectionist' requires that you beat all levels with no more than 1 mistake each, so if you play through each level the first time with that in mind, it too will be unlocked after a single playthrough. If any levels are completed with more than 1 mistake, you can simply redo them again, so all in all the achievements for this game are straightforward.The Hexcells series is wonderful, and I highly suggest you pick up the complete pack of all 3 if you enjoy peaceful deductive puzzle games."

One new mechanic is introduced compared to the first game in series - some blue cells have numbers which indicate how many of them are located in a 2 hex radius which contributes to higher game difficulty.

Luckily there is always a logical next step based on the clues you get such as ""there is 2 blues touching this hexagon"" or ""there are 3 blues in this column and they are all touching each other"". The clues get more subtle as you go on, and by the end you need to combine multiple clues and always be considering what clues have now become relevant with your latest move.There's not a huge amount of puzzles, but the quality of them is good and the solutions/levels are nicely varied.  It's already a low price and in the sale it usually drops by a good margin, so it's definitely value for money whenever you decide to pick it up.Aside from new puzzles, there's also a few new clue types compared to the first Hexcells game, if you liked the first you will like this too."

I have played the original Hexcells and quite enjoyed it, getting perfect on each level. While I liked the first game my only problem with it was the few occasions where the game forced you to guess, with literally no way to logically figure out a puzzle without risking a mistake, and having to try it again if you were going for perfect scores. Hexcells Plus claims to be more difficult, but I feel this isn't due to any real increase in difficulty, but due to artificial difficulty, particularly directed towards players who try to get perfect scores. I've finished the first three worlds, halfway through the game at this point. There have not been any new mechanics which make the game more difficult introduced, but I believe every level so far I have had to restart due to being forced to take a risk and failing. There is no logical way to solve the puzzles correctly on your first try, and the game turns into repeating levels over and over while trying to remember what to do with the spaces that have no way to be figured out. If you look at more traditional, non video game puzzles, there is usually a way to solve them without resorting to guesswork. This would have been easily possible with Hexcells Plus but the developers chose not to so they could artificially enhance the sense of difficulty. I really don't understand how this game has gotten so much praise when it's such a terrible sequel and none of the levels are well designed.Summary: Levels force you to guess rather than using logic, very poor level design overall compared to the first game."

All of the first opus's flaws are corrected, basically. The music doesn't become annoying anymore after a few minutes. The OST is made of great, relaxing tunes that get you through the puzzles. The game doesn't feel like a big tutorial but like a real game now. Of course, it's all based on simple math and logic, so it's still easy as pie. The first four worlds are a breeze and are merely an introduction to worlds 5 and 6, where the real challenge awaits. Norealdifficulty, no traps, no vicious designs though. You just need to look closely at the board, to watch every number, every line, every intersection to figure out how to go further.All this game needs to be perfect is an Undo button. How often did I have a ""mistake"" because I accidentally clicked the board (two ""mistakes"" in a level and you're basically playing for nothing)! On the other hand, it's kinda good, gives you a bit of stress, makes the game feel more hardcore.Bottom line: if you like Minesweeper (or games like Kakuro or Sudoku) you're gonna LOVE this. Still a bit much to charge 3 € for it, especially since there are only 30 levels and basically zero replay value (I've seen many free games with more content than this one), but for a short game it's relatively original, a solid concept, and lots of fun.

As you progress through the levels, you are also introduced to some new mechanics accompained by a tutorial level to make sure that you understand them. Because the puzzles are carefully and wonderfully designed, you never have to guess your next move, but finding it gets hard in the later puzzles. The interface is clean and the sound effects are cool. Hexcells is easy, Hexcells Plus gets harder in the second half and Hexcells Infinite steps back a little at the beginning, but in the end offers the most challenging puzzles. It also comes with a seed-based puzzle generator, adding 999,999,999 additional puzzles (even if they aren't hand crafted, they're still good).

If you haven’t played the first Hexcells, then you should either play that before playing Hexcells Plus, or just play Hexcells Inifinte (the last part of this review will cover that more).What I will go over is what’s new and different to Hexcells Plus compared to the first game in the series. The short answer: not much. Hexcells Plus is basically the next series of levels after the final ones in the first Hexcells game. It does re-introduce the mechanics found in the first game, but its difficulty has a sharper spike, and it’s (thankfully) quite a bit more difficult to complete. It only has 10 more levels than the first game (making a total of 36 in Plus), it takes quite a bit longer to complete than the first did, Plus in more in the range of 8-10 hours, as opposed to the scant 2 of the firstNow, what’s new about Plus? Well, it introduces two new types of cells to the game. Vacant cells that have a question mark instead of a number in them, simply not indicating how many adjacent cells contain hexes. The other type is a blue hex that contains a number, indicating how many blue hexes are within a 2 cell radius. These two mechanics add a lot more difficulty to the game, and overall make it more enjoyable.That added difficulty spike is also why my two criticisms from the first game are even more noteworthy than before. Those being: 1). An option to save your progress mid-stage to resume later, something I once again get around by taking a screenshot to glance at when re-doing my progress if I need to stop playing before I can complete a stage. 2). A way to test out potential solutions without actually applying them yet (essentially like Picross’ overlay feature). This would be far more useful here than in the first game given the more complicated puzzles, and needing to look at how all the different numbers indicating hexes interact with each so that you can determine which cells have hexes and which do not.None-the-less, Hexcells Plus is still a fun puzzle game. If you’ve already played the first game, then this one serves as a fine continuation to it, offering what is essentially a hard mode. If you’ve not played any Hexcells games, then either pick up the complete pack when it’s on sale for under $3, or get just the third and final game Hexcells Infinite, as it offers a level generator, so it offers more gameplay, if you only want one."

Then, as the puzzles continued, my mind became so occupied with the intersecting logic that I stopped trying to compare it to other games at all.The level design is excellent, and the puzzle progression slowly encourages you to learn new solving techniques, with no huge jumps in difficulty.Beware, though: Hexcells Plus doesn't save level progress.

A new mechanic is introduced and in general the levels are much more challenging and demanding. As a seasoned player of logic puzzels this game took me around 10 hours to complete and brought me much more enjoyment than the way too easy first part of the series. Sadly there still is little replayability (this is only fixed in the third installment). My only real gripe is that far too often this game derives its difficulty from a bigger quantity rather than a better quality. Most of the later levels are huge and the challenge becomes less figuring out logic puzzles than it is spotting the one tile bottleneck that lets you continue. Still each level typically has an area that is very interesting and makes you feel really satisfied after figuring it out. The absolute high point of this game were the three small levels providing tough nuts to crack with little distraction.Design and UI are the same as the first installment. The soundscape created is still interesting but I had to mute the game an hour in because it started to become grinding. During some of the larger levels a save functionality would have been nice to have. I've never encountered a bug, error or crash.If you like challenging logic puzzles this might be worth full price to you.

Correctly uncover all tiles to finish the puzzle. But various other visual clues have been added to the mix, such as: digits telling you the number of blue hexes in a row or column (or diagonal); numbered blue hexes indicating the amount of other blue tiles in its vicinity; question marks hiding information from you; and other intersting hint systems that let you deduce the locations of blue tiles without resorting to luck.As far as I know, it is always possible to deduce the tile locations using the hints given. No more of these 50/50 chances that occur all to frequently at the end of a game of Minesweeper. And mistakes are allowed too, you can continue the puzzle even after clicking on a wrong tile. Though you need to keep mistakes at a minimum to unlock everything.The presentation is clean, simple and slick. Cool visual aids are provided that help you easily identify all the tiles of a row, or all the hexes in a 2-tile radius around a numbered blue hex. These are particularly useful in big and unusually shaped puzzles (unlike Minesweeper, the shape of the grid varies from puzzle to puzzle).The electro-ambient music is also very fitting for a game that requires your full concentration. Notes are played each time you click on a tile, merging beautifully with the ongoing music. It is a detail, but it certainly adds to the experience.All in all, if you like this kind of puzzle game, you cannot pass this up."

Players are presented with an orange grid comprised to hexagons and it is up to them to determine whether these cells belong to the blue pattern or not (black cells). The black cells not part of the pattern have a number in them to indicate how many blue cells are adjacent to them, thus providing a clue as to how to proceed.After completing a puzzle the player is awarded blue hexcells based on the amount of mistakes made; these in time accumulate to unlock one of five new areas - allowing you to complete more difficult puzzles. Some areas also introduce new clues and rules to help you, making the puzzles more complex over time.New additions for the puzzles include blue cells with a number that denotes how many other blue cells are present within a two-cell radius and black cells with a question mark, making it impossible to know whether there are any adjacent blue cells.Although similar to Minesweeper as mentioned, there is a key difference: there is always a logical next step. You never have to take a gamble so if you feel stuck, take a step back and focus on another area.Why I recommend the gameHexcells Plus is a very simple puzzle game in its visual design. The menu is simple and provides the players with the option of turning the ambient music on or off and selecting one of three save slots. The same can be said for the puzzles themselves; a grid of hexagons on a white backdrop. To me this is good design, as I'm here for the puzzles and that's where the focus clearly lies.The puzzles themselves are interesting and more difficult than the original Hexcells, which is a plus.However, multiple problems I had with the original game are also present here. For instance, it is still not possible to erase a save slot so starting completely from scratch is not an option if all three slots are in use.My biggest problem with Hexcells Plus is that, like its predecesor, there is no option to save mid-puzzle forcing you to either finish it or redo the part you already completed next time.All that being said, as I have recommended Hexcells and this game is an improvement with the new rules and harder difficulty, I would encourage those interested in puzzle games to give this one a try."

Because of this, you'll never encounter a case where you have to take a random choice and have 50% chances of winning. There will always be a path to the end of the level and we you get stuck, it's more both frustrating and motivating because you know there is a path to find.Hexcell Plus introduce some features that were not present in Hexcell and is a nice improvement on the difficulty. Hexcell was easy for me untill the end of the game but Hexcell Plus got harder sooner.

,Recommended,271900,29478269,Posted: 25 January,all,Solemen Wolf,"So I played all the Hexcells games and this is the second of the series.Let me tell you something right away, if you expect this game to be exactly like the first Hexcell, IT IS NOT.This game is harder and challenging by introducing new elements.One of them is the ""?"" spaces where it removes the number around the blank spaces which forces you to look at other details for information.ALL PUZZLES IN THIS GAME CAN BE COMPLETED WITHOUT GUESSING AND JUST PURE LOGIC.Every other review that states you need to guess to progress are terribly wrong.You need to check other information such as how many blue space remind for example.IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME, I LARGELY RECOMMEND CHECKING THE100% NO MISTAKE GUIDEAS IT EXPLAINS HOW TO SOLVE EVERY PUZZLE LOGICALLY!I use it to check on cases where I am just stuck, hard, and see if there was something I missed and I missed a lot of stuff. (I also suck at counting...)Anyway, I would recommend this game if you want a challenge but do not get it if you wanted the same game as the previous version.The puzzle's pacing is long because of it.PS. Hexcells Infinite added a save feature which I wish it added in this one..."

,Recommended,271900,31099985,Posted: 12 April,all,Confanity,"A worthy successor to the original Hexcells. You will feel like a genius when you're done with these puzzles, because they start with simple rules and then combine them in ways that make you think increasingly long and hard. I recommend picking up the entire pack."

It won't last forever, but the price is so low that it's very fun to play once in a blue moon and tickle your brain.  Highly recommend it along with its predecessor, Hexcells."

76561198110595954,Recommended,271900,34092174,Posted: 7 August,all,RagnCharran,"First thing I will say is that while I do fully recommend this game, I suggest buying HexCells first. Because if it turns out you don't enjoy, or can't get your head around the logic, of these kinds of puzzles, HexCells is at least a gentler introduction to the puzzle types. And if you like HexCells, this builds on the premise with larger and more complex puzzles, and will also be worth your time and money.But as a standalone review, yes, I recommend this game. It's a solid Minesweeper style game, but with no random guessing, in part due to additional logic rules and all of the puzzles being premade rather than randomly generated. All puzzles are 100% logic solvable, with no guessing required - so at the risk of sounding condescending, if you're reading a negative review by someone who says guessing is required, they just couldn't logic the puzzle out. There was only one puzzle I did get stuck on, but it was entirely due to a stupid error I was making by not seeing something GROSSLY obvious (I literally stopped seeing a mine flag I had placed myself). The game lets you make a few mistakes without failing you on the level, but as a perfectionist I restarted from scratch each time, and was able to clear them all (aside from needing to watch a YouTube video of the level I got stuck on to see my mistake - which again was 100% MY fault, not the game). I found both the difficulty and the learning curve to be fair.The only downsides I see are:1. Because it is astandalone game, it has ""tutorial"" puzzles to teach the mechanics of the logic rules - which are boring if you already played HexCells.2. Since the puzzles are fixed, not a lot of replay value...BUT, for the cost, it's still a solid value for the time to do even one playthrough - especially if you get it on sale, like I did.3. The mouse buttons are opposite to Minesweeper, so if you're used to it (and that is kind of the target market here), it's hard to readjust. But if you've already played HexCells you should be over it by now.4. There's no ""maybe"" flag like there is in Minesweeper, so you have to do all your ""what if"" analysis in your head or on paper.Fully recommend."
,Recommended,271900,34369718,Posted: 20 August,all,Luc,"Hexcells Plus takes all the good concepts and attributes of the base game, Hexcells, and adds more clues of its own. The puzzles, especially the later ones, are definitely more challenging than those in Hexcells, but are all uniquely solvable without any guessing. If you like intricate logic games, this is a must-buy. I bought it in the sale, but it is definitely worth the full price – which is, for the record, still cheap :)"
