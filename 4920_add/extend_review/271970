76561197971951603,Recommended,271970,22696272,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,EPGAH,"It's very retro graphics, on par with say SNES, but the gameplay is exquisite.You cannot Level, but the girls you take with you can.You can still accrue EXP, though, and you can give it to your girls, or use it as currency elsewhere.You get beat down by a SLIME in the intro, and resurrected in a tavern by a man called the Haremancer, who summons two girls to help you.Each townsperson you talk to gives you ONE MAXHP bonus, permanent. Since you start with a MAXHP of only 100, that's quite a bit more generous than it sounds! (Hint: This is a game where at high Levels, you regularly give and take blows of OVER 9000!)Buying or selling in town gives the TOWN EXP!That's right, THE TOWN can Level, but not you! You can still gain stats, though, from various ""Stat Up"" hearts or veggies.Rare, and if you find a merchant who sells them, very expensive. It's all about grinding, but it's not tedious.Eat your veggies enough, and you can become King of Level 1! (As in, your Level 1 self can fight alongside your Level 250 girls, and actually make a difference, rather than have to be coddled and protected, as you'd expect.)You can capture SOME monsters (The ones that don't move, either to chase or avoid you), and use them to defend the Town, if the girls you left behind are too low-Level to do the job. The monsters movement gives an element of strategy, in that if you get behind them, you and your girls get first strike. If they get behind YOU, THEY get a free hit on YOU!There are also Bonus Bosses, who are WAY harder than any other monsters in a given dungeon--UNTIL you figure out their ""Gimmick"", at which point they become basically pushovers. In other words, Puzzle Bosses.(One of them, in an EXCEPTIONAL creative twist, asks you trivia questions about the game, and if you get it right, she damages herself to the tune of half her MAXHP!)However, even Puzzle Bosses can be ""solved"" by simply Leveling your girls up enough and then walking all over the enemy.If your whole party dies in normal play, you get teleported back to the Haremancer, to get back up and fight again.And there are Bonus Dungeons, from the Challenge Tower to the Other World.In the Challenge Tower, you get to see if you actually contribute to the group or not, because YOU can't join, only the girls can go into the Tower. Every 5 floors, either your main character gets a 5 point buff in each stat, OR the game shows you a cutscene. You cannot use Items in the Challenge Tower, only Skills and Spells.Cutscenes are hilarious, though still low-res.Think of Lufia II's ""Ancient Cave"", if you ever played that on the SNES.The Other World is where all the Bonus Bosses you've already killed go so you can beat them again and get ""Other World Points"", which can be traded for the best weapons in the game, and the all-important Stat Up Items. Be careful, though, in the Other World, DEATH IS PERMANENT!There's even a fortune-teller who allows you to make temporary changes to the NEXT DUNGEON RUN ONLY!· Fewer monsters· More monsters· Only Armor in chests· Only Weapons in chests· Only Items in chests (As in potions or Stat Up Items)· A specific seed value for the next dungeon (Useful if you are trying to capture a monster or find a particular Bonus Boss)You can order ONE change. It will take effect on your next dungeon run, then the dungeons return to ""normal"", whatever that might mean in the case of such a whimsical game.And the girls themselves not only Level, but have Affinity with you. You can gain Affinity just by fighting with them at your side, or if you have money to burn, you can buy baubles at the ring store (Or sometimes find/get them free from townsfolk) and give those to a girl to boost her Affinity. Boosted Affinity boosts stats, at least that's what it says. There's supposed to be an onsen cutscene when you get your Affinity high enough...And one of the girls IS your daughter. At first, I thought they had just mistranslated ""Musume"" from the game's original title, which can mean ""daughter"" or just ""girl"".﻿The girls are wonderfully varied and well-written, from the standard schoolgirl and healer type (The healer is depressed because she's ""average"" and there's even a running joke that if she's not in your party and you talk to her, her name shows up as ""Passer By"", until she corrects it!), to an assassin, a steroid freak, a ghost, a witch, a robot, a maid, a street-waif thief (Who is a LOT more damaging than you'd expect from that description)...and another overpowered character who is holding back because she WANTS to instead of FORCED to like your character!Plus the daughter of your own hero, who looks very much like your hero, and has junior versions of your Skills.You can talk to them and learn more about them as their Affinity rises.Each character has different Skills, some are specialized to heal, some do massive damage to one target, some damage a whole enemy party (And enemy ""parties"" can be up to 20 monsters, or at least that's the highest I've encountered so far), so you will need to customize your party to your NEEDS, as in whether you're grinding on normal monsters, or tryring to speedrun the Final Boss of a dungeon or maybe one of the Bonus Bosses.Arguably the most important loot you can find are Summon Stones. Bring them to the Haremancer, and he can summon you more girls, or if you have all the girls that are currently available to you, then you'll get ""Memories"" instead, which allow you to gain the girls' Skills on your own character!All-in-all, it's a wonderful game, if you don't mind SNES-Level graphics!﻿ Or perhaps if you PREFER retro graphics."

From what I've gathered, most of them was a result of the game crashing, which to be perfectly honest does happen. But lo and behold! Open the discussion forum for this game and you'll find an easy fix to the issue. The developer pinned the discussion thread in the hopes that it could help us unfortunate souls from lost progression torment.For those who have difficulty locating said solution need look no further. Just follow these simple easy instructions.- Close game- Open ""Run""- Type ""regedit""- In the menu bar at the top, go to ""Edit"" and then ""Find""- Type ""Enterbrain"" and press OK- Wait for search result to populate- Right-click on ""Enterbrain"" folder and deleteNow for the actual review. I gotta say, I enjoyed this game more than I thought I would. I found some of the conversations to be witty and charming, with a dash of humour all-around. Thyere's not much that hasn't been already said by others but a feature I found interesting is that if you take the time to read some of the item names and descriptions, you'll find that the humour is present there as well.An example would be the weapon Cross Sword.It's description is a 5 letter word that starts with S, the answer is Sorry. It took me a couple of moments to recognize the joke, but when it did, I actually laughed out loud (lame I know). Cross Sword = Crossword.But I do wonder how in the world did I have 2 save files with leveled up characters in the first 2 save slots, before even playing the game. I've heard of others whose save files have been overwritten. My condolensces, my advice is to save on the lower save files, or even better, have multiple save files so that the probability of your save files (and progress) disappearing would be lower."

,Recommended,271970,32890979,Posted: 27 June,all,Cerzel,"Many RPGMaker games are focused on the humour of poking fun at RPG tropes, but many of them don't do that well. Hero and Daughter is one that does, with consistently funny writing and entertaining plot developments that keep each chapter fresh. While primarily a grinding game, H&D actually has competent gameplay as a result of the large cast with their diverse skills, town building elements, dungeon events, and very fast battles. There's a surprising amount of content in the game, with things only really starting to slow down in the second to last chapter, and the final chapter naturally offers you the ultimate bosses that you'll need hours of grinding to beat. Might be a pain for those total completionists, but if you're willing to pass on the bonus bosses you'll get a pretty well-paced and fun experience out of it."

There's an almost limitless amount of content.

After some searching it doesn't seem there's a reliable fix for this--so as much as I'd love to recommend spending many hours grinding away in this happy waifu-world, you'll hit the crash wall eventually. For that, I have to say no sale.It's a sad state for an RPG love-letter that always gives you something worthwhile to do with your time; a collection of character content, spicey dialogue, minigames and RPG-type extras. The raw amount of characters will ensure that you find at least one waifu in the mix, and if decorating your imaginary home is your kind of jam, there's also no shortage of tinkery homestuffs to make your virtual abode cosy.The combat has enough unique skills that it becomes more than button-bashing in certain instances, and the individual types and bonus enemies mean you can always find an extra challenge. I found the momentum of the game to dwindle as it reached a conclusion, but for 12 hours of gameplay in such a happy scenario I think H&D+ would be worth it if the bothersome bug that strips you of yr precious levels were taken care of."

I love their interactions with the hero and the ""Haremancer"", and you can raise their affection by taking them to battle with you, or buying them gifts, and you can learn more about their backstories.

This game has the unique twist you are Level 1 and cannot gain levels at all, meaning you have to farm stat boosters and rely on allies (if you are into waifus, which all your allies are, you will have fun getting them all, like a non pornographic Pokemon meets harem anime, though it's a bit ecchi though, be warned if that turns you off)The gameplay is mix of Diablo style dungeon crawling (with maps that are semi-random like the bonus dungeons in Final Fantasy 1 & 2 Dawn of Souls and classic front view RPG turn based combat, though with the twist all you allies are very specialized and you must pick and choose wisely.However, you must try to keep all your summoned waifus leveled and well equipped, as the game includes a sim element where you ""level up"" a village, and as you do, the village get attacked from time to time, with the waifu force as the defenders, so can't just bench and ignore part of your harem force either.It's very forgiving for the most part, so a noob need not fear jumping in, it's pretty self explanatory on the game mechanics and while it's a pain to keep your main character from dying early on, the game includes tons of ways to make him not suck so much, not to mention is kinda encourages you to have the waifus do most of the work anyway.Overall, it won't win awards for originality, but it's VERY fun in a Diablo style way, and as a big Diablo II fan, this game is like that, just more colorful, slightly easier, and with a lot of waifus as support."

Instead of focusing on making new graphics or sound, the devs have done significant work on mechanics and gameplay systems.The game goes through a pleasurable feedback loop of handling preparation of dungeon romps in town with facilities that level up as you spend money on their wares, increasing their inventory or effects, and interacting and leveling up your team of summoned party members before heading out.Dungeons themselves run off of a mild RNG permutation system, where the dungeons have at least 10 possible builds for each to go through, but the treasures/amount of monsters is diffrent upon each entry, certain dungeon builds will also have certain special bosses to fight, and you can adjust some of the variables of a dungeon before entry via a facility in town.  Monsters appear on the field, where running into them initiates a fight, and you have multiple enemy group types you can tell via their sprite, such as normal groups, mini-bosses, and special metal/gold slimes.  Special NPCs will also populate dungeons that add some variety in the form of mini-games or random chance events that can gamble with your stats/money in exchange for rare items.  Anytime you leave a dungeon, either via beating the dungeon's boss or being wiped out, you get to keep your experience and any items you've found.  There is also a chance of a random event playing out between characters when coming back from a dungeon.The game is very freewheeling with how it doles out improvements to your group, while your main character cannot level up, he can still accumulate experience which can be used as a special currency for certain facilities or as bonus experience for party members, and your party members already can level up incredibly fast.But most of all, your party members are powerful.  Any given character will feel like they would be completely overpowered in any other game given their special abilities.  Especially early on, unlocking a character's abilities is a treat in opening up new ways of completely stomping the opposition, and several characters can easily keep single enemies - bosses included - on lockdown.Do you need your party to have every stat buffed immediately with the possibility to constantly stack buffs?  There's a character for thatDo you need to do armor piercing multi hit combos to an entire enemy group? There's a character for thatDo you need to charm a boss?  There's a character for thatDon't take this as an endorsement of the game being easy, party synergy is a big part of this, but later game situations will take into account that you can do all of this.Getting said overpowered miracles of destruction requires summon stones, which you can get in chests, from bosses, or special challenges.   Any time a summoning stone is spent it gives you a random girl from the playable roster, and they take up place in the town's pub, where you can talk with them, give them gifts, or pour EXP from your personal stash into them.  It's ok to be greedy with snatching girls from various places across the multiverse, as any you leave in town while dungeon romping will help level the town up.The writing for all the game's characters is light hearted and goes for a rather teenage sensibility, there's not much in the way of long winded rants or incredibly serious and dire emotional scenes, everything is in service to the comedy and doing mild exploration of character personalities and backstories.While the game's content might seem sparse at the first glance of what you are dealing with, you can be assured it will offer up plenty of new features and optional challenges to do as you advance forward.   And if you should ever feel you might be getting a bit too overpowered, there are features down the line that allow you to adjust character stats as you see fit.I whole heartedly recommend this, it reminds me of the simple joy older console RPGs use to go for in the 90's, and if you recall the ""Ancient Cave"" from the lufia/estapolis series, then you have a similar idea at play here."

Probably more busy than the main story.  Besides the girl's portraits and battle sprites, as far as I can tell a lot of pretty much everything else is straight from the RPG maker starting pack with some nice touch-ups and edits here and thereI guess something I would nitpick is that there was a fairly large level gap at one point that I hit because my party set-up was really good for bosses, and now dungeons are a big hassle.

Every new girl brings something new to your game, and while you'll end up favoring just a few, the combos of girls are unlimited.Angel, Red Witch, and Princess, are my personal favorite companions but I have not even begun to experiment with all the girls, let alone unlock them all.This game is worth playing if you are looking for a bit of light hearted comedy and adventure."

It's weird I hate games that base their entire system around grinding but this one is actually doesn't really feel like you are for a while. My one and biggest complaint is that there seems to be a scripting error that occurs when you get higher level in the game. It seriously pisses me off to be honest I can't go 1 hour without an SS3 error occuring and wiping my insane amounts of progress in challenge tower. But up until that its a good game to use as a cool down mindless game until you switch back to the hardcore like Dark souls 3 or Fallout 4 Survival mode.

,Recommended,271970,24392590,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,Darkaros,"Fast-paced and addictive dungeon-diving fun, but grindy-in-a-good way -- lots of progression if you want to sink your time in it. The game is a typical JRPG, with a minor social/dating aspect talking to your party members. Its strengths are definitely in its variety (you can experiment with over 35 characters to take on several dungeons) and amount of content (as you progress further, more functions get unlocked).You can play this as complex or as a simply as you like -- either a strong main party that absolutely wrecks dungeons to speed through content, or a rotating party to eventually achieve 100% completion. I'm playing a mix of these styles, as I use a main party whenever I want more gold to skill up my other party members whenever I want to backtrack and hunt down more Bounty bosses. One nice function is that the main character, despite being locked at level one, still gets EXP which can be then given to other party members, allowing you to power level new characters. This, combined with the gift system letting you buy affection, means that it's completely possible to play with just a main party.One thing I hate about poorly-made RPGMaker games is that they take forever to progress through the text and combat. In Hero and Daughter, you can hold down the main action button to absolutely fly through combat. An auto combat button is also added, with the ability to modify your characters' AI to avoid wasting abilities when they don't need to, but so far it's faster just holding down action and spamming the default attack.The story itself is generic outside of the level one gimmick, and the characters know it -- it's just a silly, funny romp.Overall, this is one of the most user-friendly and plain fun games I've played. I found out about it from the DegiGames newsletter as an award-winning game, so I knew it would be good. I picked it up because the concept seemed interesting, but I've been continuing to play it because it's just that fun.Note that I too have experienced the RGSS3 crash error -- hopefully this is not a common bug, and I think that it was caused because I kept having this game open while doing other things."

76561198040255092,Recommended,271970,22825953,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,HeroDave,"(Edited Review)I am updating my review due to the fix of the issue I had previously. Since the below issue has been resolved I will gladly re-recommend this game.I've been having a ton of fun playing this game so far. I had built 2 parties, a main and secondary, the former hitting about level 80 while mid dungeon. While the game is relatively simple in terms of play, the amount of content involved clearly took a lot of time to develop. There are plenty of small aspects that add up to make this a very worth-while play. I did, however, run into an issue: mid dungeon after my party had gained about 10 levels my party bugged after a battle and would only run straight down. Not just that, but in the menu and in combat the down key did not work at all. I tabbed out to see if my key had broken but it worked fine elsewhere, so it was an in-game issue. After trying to figure things out for about 10 minutes my game closed out (no chance to save as you have to move UP in order to get to the save point in the tavern). Upon restarting my game most of the characters I had acquired (and I had them all) were gone. It did not revert to a previous save as the first characters I had acquired were missing. The remaining characters were missing almost all of their levels, ranging from 5-12, only random characters were remaining and only a few of them. Another thing of note was that I somehow had 2 save files when I had only ever used one. I would have liked to send this message to the developer directly to try to provide anymore information as to help solve this issue but I'm not sure how to do that.Before this happened this was an amazing game, very well thought out and had great gameplay. As of right now this is kind of a big issue though... there isn't much of a point to building something up when you know somewhere down the road it will just be torn down. I will gladly update this review if they can get the problem solved."

The game has crashed, and completely erased summoned characters. Its even radically changed what level I was on, and opened tons of other areas I hadn't even been to yet.It has made playing a bit more random, and in a way, has kept it from getting boring...BUT, I like to know that spending 4 hours leveling a set of characters wasn't completely wasted when I log back in and suddenly find them all at level twenty when they were previously 100+That being said, I find the Level 1 hero to be an interesting and creative twist, if somewhat time consuming in terms of dungeon crawling and lady leveling.Other then the issues with in game glitching, I've actually really enjoyed the game.OF course, I'd enjoy it more if it didn't feel like a beta run, but that could just be me."

I don’t normally even buy RPGMaker games, although after playing this for quite a while I’ve started paying more attention to them.Anyway, this is just an incredibly entertaining game. Your hero gets stuck at level 1, so he has to summon girls from other worlds to do the fighting for him. There are quite a lot of these girls and all of them have different skills. Apart from the first girl you can’t really know who you’ll get, since the summons are random, so you’ll have to come up with strategies which work with whoever you have.The story actually does eventually progress from there, but I don’t feel like spoiling it too much. I’ll just say that there is much more content in this game than it initially seems. I literally thought about 10 times I had finally beaten the game, and more content just kept appearing... The difficulty also builds up gradually. The game seems to be very easy at first, but it’s only because you aren’t as far into it as you think. There are also characters who seem to be quite crappy, but whose skills are actually good at some point later on.So yeah, the fighting is quick and entertaining, there is lots of things to do, the girls are cute, the music is great, the humor is funny, what can I say except highly recommend this game?"
