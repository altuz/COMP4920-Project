Reminds me of the fun i use to have when playing the original Pokemon games in the 90's. Who cares about how the game was made? It's fun and i'm enjoying it. Thats all that matters.Something i will add after progressing into the game. You may find yourself getting lost quite easily, as being able to find some of the locations in this game rely on whether you have a good memory."
,Not Recommended,272010,14204691,"Posted: 27 January, 2015",all,Fractal Fischer,"Just finished part 1 of this series and boy am I drowsy...Aveyond has a lot of things going for it with some really pleasant sound design, excellent graphics (for a 16-bit style RPG) and fairly interesting characters with some decently writen parts.  It really does look nice and as far as I can tell it's all-original.  The sound is especially good with some really well done environment ambience and some really memorable tunes.   However, the gameplay itself just really turned me away from continuing this series.  And by the way, I found out just now that it was a series.  Never noticed the part of the description clearly noting this.  My fault I guess.I really tried to stay engaged with this game after the first few really well done opening acts, but it steadily became more and more apparent that this game has issues that I don't want to be subscribed to.  The character development, game mechanic-wise, is nonexistant.  Leveling up has a neglegible impact on combat with every character stepping up through the same present 30 HP tiers.  The only other attribute not directly associated with gear is physical strength, and raising this didn't seem to actually change anything in combat.  Basically, your stats are your equipment, and there are only a few sets in the game.  Grinding is hardly worth it for just a few additional HP.The battles are beyond basic as well.  Think Final Fantasy Mystic Quest here.  There are 3 status effects, each has maybe 1 or 2 enemies that use it exclusively, and aside from that it's just trading blows until someone runs out of health.  There is basically one cheap-shot strategy to beat every boss:  keep tripping them every round (it'll almost always succeed) and let the rest of your squad wail on them unimpeded.  Or you can just let the vampire wear the curse armor (she finds it almost immediately), and she is then essentially invicible the whole game by way of the drain ability.  Speaking of abilities, there are only two character that even do anything besides attack, and they are each basically pigeon-holed into a set function.  The healer does absolutely nothing but heal/shield/cure, and the main character can either trip or steal, however I never had the steal ability succeed even once in the whole game.  Not sure if it works or not to be honest.I have very little to say about the story really, despite this being one of the key aspects of a good RPG.  It starts out really promising with an interesting premise and characters, but for whatever reason it gets about a halfway into it and then devolves into what I would describe as a sequence of random events.  You go random places with no real compulsion to do so, you do random things for random people, and then thankfully by plot contrivance one of the random people give you your mcguffin for no real reason.  They just happened to have it I guess.The final nail in the coffin is the quest and map design.  I'm not sure how long I actually spent playing as I went AFK a couple hours here and there to do other things, but I'd estimate it was at least 5 ot 6 hours.  Take out the time spent walking endless back and forth from opposite ends of the game and I bet you could cut it down to 1/4 of that.  So. Much Walking.  You have no idea how much uneventful walkthrough you're in for with this game.  There is a fast travel system, but it is prohibitively expensive and less than adequate for the amount of back-and-forth the quests have you doing.Aveyond looks nice, sounds nice, and had potential at the start, but the story just sort of wanders off halfway through and sadly I found the gameplay to be just flat out boring.  I'll be interested to see what this dev does next though, and hopefully they'll put a bit of poilish on those combat mechanics and come up with something that's as enjoyable to play as it is to see and hear."

,Not Recommended,272010,9309459,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,Lord of Crack,"This  game is just alright and thats being nice. Intially it  was  fine, however  as you proceed  you discover it really lacks depth, ingame looks shoddy  lacking creativity, the gameplay is a  snooze and the so called humor, perhaps  it's there if you're 10.  And the the price certainly  should not be 10$   it's  not even the full story  just a part which is super dissapointing.This game is good for a rainy day, however paying full price is not worth it. I may give the sequel a try if it goes on sale significantly.When it comes to games like this I just can't resist,  unfortunately however  there is  almost always, too high of an expectation and a less than average gameplay experience as a   result of these rpg maker games. Based on my play through of the beloved final fantasy  and golden sun series and many others, growing up. Golden sun being one of my all time favorite jrpg  games its understandable how many games seem to underdeliver. :DUnderstandably this  may have been a  typical, low budget, rpg-maker game   it still could have been better.This game was  dissapointing, But still worth the try if onsale.4/10"

It's made using RPG maker, so naturally, the controls and visuals are going to be limitted. However, this isn't a problem if a game makes up for it through gameplay.Unfortunately, this one doesn't. It starts out well enough, but a couple hours in, it becomes one wild goose chase after the next.Let me elaborate. As a general rule of thumb, if the only alternative to searching everywhere for the one obscure way forward, after reading all relevant text, is to use Google, then the player is not being given enough direction. This is especially true if that one way forward involves traipsing across half a continentand back. I understand this was a common way to artifically lengthen games back in the NES/SNES era where cartridges' data storage was limited, but we are no longer in that era, nor was it really a good idea to begin with. A game does not need to be long to be good; look at Portal, for example.I was forced into this situation no less than three times before I gave up and decided my gaming time was better spent elsewhere."

,Recommended,272010,9407271,"Posted: 9 March, 2014",all,Reinveil von Megabee,"I've scratched my original review entirely now that I've finished the game.  From what I understand this is the first part (of four) of the third game in the Aveyond series; a curious place to start for Steam gamers unfamiliar with Amaranth's work.As with most games made with RPG Maker, writing quality weighs heavily upon whether or not a title is worth your time and money.  Here Lord of Twilight is thankfully relatively solid.  Most attempts at humor fall flat, but character dialogue is decent enough, if occassionally a bit unnatural.  The overarching plot is kind of all over the place at this point, and the game ends on a really weird note, but of course this is only the introductory chapter of a larger narrative.Graphics are nothing to write home about, with much of what's on display being RM stock assets.  Character designs are attractive though, and the handful of original assets are done well.  Map design is occasionally frustrating, particularly in towns, which have a tendency to be needlessly convoluted and complex (a lot of dead ends, no shadowing to indicate changes in elevation, etc).Many games using this engine are plagued with slowdown, but Aveyond runs smoothly throughout.The soundtrack is really the standout feature here, featuring catchy town themes and one of the better battle tunes I've heard in recent memory.Overall I would cautiously recommend Lord of Twilight.  It's quite rough around the edges in parts, but I enjoyed myself enough to stick it out and am curious to see what happens in the next installment."
76561198054046176,Not Recommended,272010,9980265,"Posted: 30 April, 2014",all,Seph,"An interesting story however there's just something lacking that keeps me from wanting to continue.  It feels like a grind for some reason I can't put my finger on.  The sounds are nice but in the wild there's no music tho there are little things like crickets, bird calls, the sound of rushing water.  The story bounces around quite a bit between who you play as which is a downside as for some reason you share inventory.  Purchasing weapon and armor upgrades are a pain because they are so few and far between, not to mention farming for money just to afford those things, and even the items that help you survive like potions etc. are over priced.    Let's look back to a much earlier RPG called Secret of Mana originally for the Super Nintendo back when Square was still Squaresoft.  This game was immaculate in its leveling and purchasing system.  You never felt like you where grinding for eternity to get that next set of gear for your characters and the music made you WANT to go into the wilds and kill stuff, don't get me started on how great the combat system was, it wasn't turn based but it was great.  I didn't play much of this game because of aforementioned reasons and I only give it a 6/10."

I Mean, is it really that hard?Seriously, the only Sound option you´ve got is ""on"" or ""off"". And like flashgames, its way too loud by default. I´m Aware of the fact, that I can change it via the windows soundmixer, but it should belong in the options in the first place.The Gameplay is Boring, like most of these RPGmaker games are, the ""Humour"", that is advertised isnt there if you´re older then 12.So far i´m not Impressed at all and think I wasted 10€ on this.Update:There is more that bothers me, then the Volume issue. But that was just the first bad thing, that jumped on me. Same with the Resolution, others mentioned it in there review´s too. I use two Monitors and when started in fullscreen, it ♥♥♥♥s up my whole 2 desktops.Ofc I could change the volume of the game in the windows soundmixer, but thats not the point. Image you buy a game, that is way too loud and someone comes and says. ""hey, just turn down your Speaker volume."" The story is cliché and boring. You are the daughter of an ancient powerfull blabla and you must save the world because... Reasons. The fights are way out of Date. Dont get me wrong, I grew up in the 90´s and Played, and loved games like Final Fantasy,Chrono trigger and so on. But we got the Year 2014 and games like these are out of Date. Thats it. If you are totaly and Oldschool gamer, maybe its something for you. But As someone who realised that there are games out there, for 10€, that offer way more Entertainment, its just scam in my oppinion. Played it for an Hour or so, and I didnt feel comfortable at all by doing so. Worst buy 2014 so far on me.And still, didnt saw any of the Advertised ""humour"" anywhere."

Now this would be fine except for the fact that the resulotion is bad. So I go to the options menu and find it's lackluster at best, yes or no kinda bad.Once in the game it looks ... okay, I mean it's not bad. Just looks so standard and unimaginative.The tutorial is ... weird, you choose between keyboard and mouse controll and then completly ignores the other option even though you will use both methods.Once in the game it gets better, the gameplay is standard and so is the plot. Oh, and there is apparently humor.All in all a okay game, even if it is a bit on the boring side."

While Aveyond: Rhen's Quest remains my favourite, Aveyond 3 has a lot of replay ability and is an overall good game with a good story and concept. There are many missable things, so you have to be aware of anything and everything - like the candy at Witchwood.Honestly, give it a go. Buy it on special. It is a decent old-school style rpg game."
