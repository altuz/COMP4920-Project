,Recommended,272040,8823725,"Posted: 23 January, 2014",all,Pebblig,"It''s a very pretty game, with nice soothing music in the menu. The aim in each of the puzzles is to ""clear"" the screen by making  all the paper the same colour by applying coloured paper to it in as few moves as possible. There isn't any time element to it, so solving the puzzles is quite relaxing and when the game gets tricky it becomes challenging, but not in a frustrating way. There's also a hint system to solve puzzles that you're stuck on. For the price, it's a lovely little indie game with very nice graphics which will probably get you several hours of gameplay, there is also a complex set of puzzles too.(I think it's very resonably priced) - Definitley worth a try if you love a good puzzle game!"

In total, there are 63 puzzles as of 23 Jan, 2014. Each puzzle has different challenges and can vary in difficulty. There are two different types of puzzles you can do - premium puzzles and classic puzzles. Both great game modes with distinctive styles. Soundtracks are nice, relaxing and peaceful."

The gameplay is simple yet challenging; the goal being to convert the entire board into a single colour of paper within an alotted amount of moves. The amount of puzzles is quite large (20+ levels that contain 9 puzzles each) and they increase in difficulty over time by adding more colours of paper and through making denser shapes with them.There are hints available to help with puzzles you're struggling with; however they are rationed daily to prevent you from rushing through the game unjustly; which I found enjoyable as it forced me to sit down and examine pieces for longer - which in turn increased my apprecation of the delicate nature of the design.My only wish is that the thematic music (traditional japanese accents) was looped, or had a several tracks to move through. Currently the only music played is when the game is opened or when a puzzle is completed in the correct manner. These little tunes help encourage the setting intended by the designers, so it would have been nice to have more of the same - and with an option to mute or not (there is currently no mute function, meaning that if you put your own music on and complete a puzzle the in-game tunes will still play (I would have probably bought the OST as a bundle too if it was available)).But that's just a minor complaint honestly. If you want to have a relaxing time and feel like you're being mentally challenged in a pleasing and charming way, then please buy this game. If nothing else, it's nice to have in your library when you want some quiet time to either just have some light fun or to just zone out and relax (i'd also recommened putting on some chill or classical music whilst playing, it just makes all that much more pleasing)."

The music and sound effects and soft and unintrusive, but I did turn off the music so i could watch videos and listen to music on the side.

The goal of every puzzle is to get the board to a single color in the fewest number of moves.Kami ramps up appropriately, exploring various types of boards and helping you figure out new tricks and strategies. The puzzles are a nice blend of thinking through conceptually (what strategy should I use in deciding where to click?) and just clicking somewhere to see what happens. The puzzles can get fairly difficult, forcing you to change your plan of attack when it isn't working. Only one puzzle felt completely impossible; I tried it for an hour after beating the rest of the game but  finally gave up and used the hints. At the other end of the spectrum, maybe 30-50% of the puzzles are very easy, requiring one or two attempts.Except for the level I couldn't solve, perfecting all the levels took about 7 hours. This is long enough to include a substantial amount of content, but not so long for the levels to feel repetitive or tedoius.The atmosphere, graphics, and experience are smooth, with care put into the details. For example, the game allows you to click again while one click is still playing out -- this is really a no-brainer, but too many games don't have such features.Cons: First, I would have appreciated some steam achievements for the game. Second, at least two later levels were solvable in fewer moves than the ""perfect"" solution; I personally would have appreciated the extra challenge. Finally, there is the minor annoyance that pressing ESC puts the game into small windowed mode instead of quitting (I'll get used to it)."
,Recommended,272040,33680560,Posted: 20 July,all,Nokia 3210,"Kami delivers all that I expected when I bought the game. The gameplay feels good, the controls are perfect. But, Why I'm saying this? Because there are a bunch of ported games from IOS and Android that have clunky controls, lack of undo and reset button, slow transitions/animations, and some waste a lot of time in load a new level or restart the level.About the puzzle itself, some of them can be really tough but you can purchase a hint to make the first move, and this helps a lot when you don't know what color and segment switch.- My only concern is the lack of achievements and trading cards, some people find this pointless but for me, this gives the game more value to my purchase, I would love to craft some badges and complete 100% of the game."

Fullscreen, music on/off and some other option. But hey, it's an iOS port so it should run on certain types of vegetables.Overall it is a good game to play while on the toilet or when you're bored.

Some of the trick solutions were particularly devious and brilliant, and I would never have even guessed the opening move if it weren't for the hint system.The way the game gives you hints is fair, while still making you work for it. I played anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour every day until I finished the game, and a good chunk of that time was spent staring at puzzles because I used all my hint credits for the day, and nothing I tried was working.

Most puzzles only take a try or two to solve, but some are tricky. The whole vibe aims to minimize frustration, but I still felt a little thwarted when I couldn't solve a puzzle quickly. Nevertheless, the paper-folding sound effects are nice, the visual effect of the paper unfolding is pleasant, the music is soothing, and it mostly succeeds in engaging your mind in a meditative problem-solving mood."

Can be played slow whilst pondering every move, or quick to go with the instaflow. =) Whichever, the challenge is new every time and grows on you pretty fast. Me like!"
,Recommended,272040,16787811,"Posted: 29 June, 2015",all,McFrugal,"This is how KAMI works:  Click on a square to assign it a new color, and all connecting squares of that color will change too.  Change it to the color of squares near that group, and you can change those squares next move too, as they're now the same color.  Do this until the whole area is one color.There is a surprising amount of depth to the game, but I didn't have a lot of trouble with it.  Also, the last 9 ""premium"" (free expansion) levels seemed to be random garbage.  Even so on a couple of those levels I got UNDER the perfect score, which seems like it shouldn't be possible.  Maybe those levels weren't very polished.  I feel as though a bigger playing area could have added some needed challenge and enabled more varied puzzle designs.It's very pretty too, but I wouldn't pay 4 bucks for this.  Get it on sale."

,Recommended,272040,16663285,"Posted: 23 June, 2015",all,aliceinhell,"KAMI is one of the best puzzle games I've played in a while. The concept is simple and the gameplay is challenging, which is right up my street. Add all that to the beautiful aesthetics and soundtrack, and you have yourself a near perfect game. Although the game is a little short, I have gotten 9 hours of fun (and, sometimes, frustration... and then relief upon finding the solution) out of KAMI so far, and I definitely see myself returning to it at some point. Well worth the price.My only real gripe is that the second set of the premium puzzles were much unlike the others, as instead of simple colours, the folded paper had harsh black and white patterns, which really hurt my eyes and made it difficult to focus on the screen, which meant I had to keep coming back to them later. I understand that the patterns were used to add to the difficulty, but it wasn't for me.Other than that though, the game is perfect (in my opinion, of course), and the level of difficulty is just about right. You can always aim for ""OK"" scores rather than ""perfect"" if the challenge is a bit much on some of the puzzles, but personally I love the challenge of solving the puzzle in the absolute minimum number of moves. I definitely recommend KAMI and I look forward to trying other games created by State of Play."

You'll have streaks of 5 puzzles that take less than a minute of thinking, then you suddenly cant solve the next one without hints.7/10Would recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games."
,Recommended,272040,17147936,"Posted: 20 July, 2015",all,gNatalie,"A simplistic paper-puzzle game. Goal of the puzzle, make the papers all the same colour, but do it in the set number of moves. Really challenges you mentally and often when you are close, you are actually farthest from the correct way to do it. Think outside the box.Straightforward but hours of entertainment. I personally play this when watching a movie or when killing time.8/10"

Though the addition of some resolution settings would be much appreciated.(Lack of graphics settings is a shared downside for some games from this studio, including this and Lumino City. I haven't tried other titles, but I'd assume it's true for them too.)"

It should more than satisfy the casual puzzler and becomes vexing enough to satisfy puzzlers looking for a challenge. The music is also minimal, with the ability to turn it on or off within the puzzle screen (I prefer it off and only having to listen to it when in the puzzle selection screens.) And I presonally have yet to tire of the paper folding soud effect. At $3.99 it's a great value for the amount of game time you get out of it and I higly recommend it."

(But at least you can mute it ingame).Difficulty is not linear. You can pass 15min on one and 10 sec and the next one...And don't tell me how much hint I need per day !
