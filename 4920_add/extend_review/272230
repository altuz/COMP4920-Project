Improve that somehow or this game is only worth getting back to if you just organize gunfighters."

The game is advertised as being about teamwork and co-operation and compromise, but good luck even joinig a corporation to enjoy that aspect of the game when you need to have friends in a corporation already before you can even join one.On top of that all the servers are empty except one or two, and even if you were blessed enough to manage joining a corporation - nobody cares or even wants to roleplay. You are supposed to be able to complete deals peacefully, but that never happens. As soon as anyone sees someone else, they start firing.It's not a corporate business simulator, its a god damn civil war and the 4 corps are the rival armies.Sad to say it but if you think this game is going to be fun, you are mistaken, and it's completely because of the community."

I cant express how happy that made me, I have been following it for a little more than a year, waiting to be able to get into the alpha. I will warn you though, it has a learning curve and that may put some of you off from it, for example: how to load/unload your gun.step 1: equip gun by pressing 1, after you purchase it.step 2: equip ammo by pressing shift+2-5, what ever button your ammo is on after you purchase it.step 3: press shift+R to load, shoot things.step 4: press shift+R to UNload empty mag.step 5: press shift+`(tilda) to drop empty mag.step 6: follow steps 2-5 to reload again.now some pros and cons:Pros:-fun gameplay, yes I only have 2.5hrs atm, but I have not had that much fun with random people in a long time.-Can lead a faction, if you are lucky enough to get the big bosses phone-has a phone system to contact members of your faction as well as people from others to conduct trades for missions.-You can decide if you want to play nice and follow the deals that were set up or you can kill the people who show up to do the deal, your choice!-literally if you just want to drive around and shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can.-lots more but I want to get back to playing so I may or may not update later.Cons:-I personally have HUGE FPS drops when around more than 5-6 people or when someone nearby uses voice chat.-only 3 mission types, however they are fun even after doing them over and over for 2.5 hrs already.-steep learning curve, a plus for me but I am sure most wont see it that way.-No control layout that I found.-very little ability to change graphic settings.-only 2 servers, that I saw, not sure if they are going to put more up since its on steam, I hope they do.In closing, for now, I would recomend this to anyone who wants to have some fun. If you liked GTA you will most likely enjoy this. Join up people!"

Didn't have to wait long for the train, I stepped on and was in downtown in minutes. Got off at the stop in front of the car dealership, didn't see anyone so I decided to walk around. Only half a block away before a man in a tux shouted at me from a car.""Hey!"" I stopped and turned around.""Yoh?"" I said, unsure.""How much money you got?"" He asks.I naively tell him right away. ""Only a thousand.""""Get in."" He says quickly. I do so, getting into the passenger seat. ""How long you been here?"" He asked as he starts driving.I tell him honestly. ""Just got here."" A pause from him before he spoke again.""Don't kill anyone till you know the rules here."" He says. Wtf!? What have I gotten myself into?""Oh... Kay..."" I said slowly.We get to a warehouse and he stops at the door. ""Open up."" He yells. The door opens and there's three men in suits inside. Two armed with guns pointed at us. Omg.The driver goes in slowly and pulls up to the office in the back. ""Out. Follow."" He says firmly. I do as told and follow him into the office. He throws a tux at me. ""Alright. Lets go."" He says to everyone. ""The van."" He added as we all walked out. I follow far behind, still unsure of what's going to happen.Four of us get in, I choose the very back, another chooses a middle seat, the other two in the driver and passenger seats. We take off across the town.After an hour everyone opens fire on a limo, besides me, I don't have a gun. The man in the owner seat gets shot and dies. ""Jesus Christ!"" I yell. ""This isn't what I signed up for!""The Middle takes a moment to reload before turning to look at me, dread serious eyes on mine. ""This is exactly what you did."" He says before shooting some more.The driver laughs,""Welcome to Sub Rosa!"" He says. Eventually everyone from the limo is dead. We stop by it, the two getting out and walk around before getting back in and drive off, talking about going to the hospital before The Driver stops. ""Did you get the disk?"" He asked the other guy.There was long pause before the man in The Middle laughs. ""Nope."" He says.""Crap."" The Driver said laughing himself. We go back and they get what they were after.We go to the hospital and The Middle and I get out. I wait outside, The Driver goes off and returns right as The Middle is done inside. The Driver tosses us both burgers. ""Eat it."" He says to me. I do as told.We go back to the warehouse, Passenger is back already, opens the door for us, once in we all get out of the van, Middle goes to the office, The Driver gives me about two thousand bucks. ""Okay, next part."" He says then.I choose to vocally my confusion. ""I have no idea what I'm doing!""The Driver looks to the other two, ""Go. I'll teach him."" He says. The other two leave. In a few hours I 'learn the basics.' How to get a gun, reload, bandage. Give him back my tux. We then leave in a car together and he drops me off at another warehouse. ""Stick with the. You make millions."" He says and I he out of the car, he drives off.I didn't choose the life. It chose me!"

Had been hyped on this game for a while..Though this is ""Still"" in Alpha, it has been on Early Access / in development for the past 2-3 years (since 2014). I don't feel any enjoyment with the game.-It is not very user friendly.-The practice mode is useless.-There is hardly anyone online. Maybe 3-4 players and that was it, for one server. No one else.- Terrible ControlsI had no idea on what exactly were the controls, I could barely manage to reload and insert a mag.This game wasn't even available for purchase until this year (I think), since the last few years of it's announcement you couldn't purchase it on steam and had to go to their website to apply for a key or somet(if I remember correctly). I paid $18 for a game that was 50mb and failed to at least give a better intro to learning the controls and what not. Even seen by other people that purchased the game mentioning that the development (or updates if you will) were very slow.Honestly, really disappointing. Had potential. Now doesn't..."

Now man listen : You have 5 companies and all of them have jobs etc. I will not give you any tutorial about this, you can find tutorial videos on youtube etc. . But i want to talk about few stuff. Before you buy it. I will explain few stuff on topics and then i will give you my verdict.Pros+Community+Randomness+Basic gameplayCons- Community- Repetetive- Laggy visualsStarting with Pros:Community : Well first of all lets make this clear, This game has the best and the most annoying community ever. Now you may get confused, but listen to this. You can meet with some great people and have hours of fun then maybe join other teams and enjoy the game, that is good part of community, but some ''Trolls'' will be there for trolling you and annoying you. Right now there is not much players 50/60 players per day but if you can get on like some hours you may sure find 20 players in one sw. I think thats becasue game is still on alpha.Randomness : Everything can happen here. You dont know what will happen 5 mins later, on phone people can say you a good deal, and then ambush you once stuff starts. BUT thats the point of this game, you must be prepared. Its always see to find stuff like these in games.Gameplay : Once you learn the controls and learn how to play. You know almost about everything. 1/2 hours into the game and you probably know how to do everything. Now usually this would be boring but Randomness of this game makes everything betterConsCommunity : As i told above, nothing more nothing lessRepetetive : It is very repetetive but randomness makes everything better. I hope devs will fix this once game is out of alpha.Laggy Visuals : First i thought i was lagging. But later i learned if you have a basic/medium grade PC you may feel a little uncomfortable at first, BUT dont let this put you off from the game, you will get used to it. BUT i really really hope that devs will fix this problem too.Final Verdict : Buy it ! Our community is getting larger and i belive more features will be added soon. If you managed to deal with lag and a little bit of hard learning curve, you will have a very decent gaming experience.To the Devs : Guys great work, game is fun but please , PLEASE ! Fix some of the problems above if possible. We need more content in the game. Maybe sniper rifles,pistols more vehicles, more missions, more equipment etc. will give us more fun and enjoyment, btw please increase the player limit for servers, theres usually 1 server which gets full very fast, and people dont join anything except that.THANK YOU FOR READING THIS ! I HOPE IT DID HELP YOU ! :)"

You will quickly find yourself and others killing, and decieving; hunting, and running, as you climb a long and crime-riddled ladder to reach a golden nirvana, shimmering with bright red blood and the spoils that come with it.Despite being alpha, this game has surpassed and broken videogame barriers that do not even exist yet. As did version 0.07 of the game, it centralizes the gameplay and outcomes entirely on human level trust, something yet to be seen in triple-A titles. You will find that communication and cooperation proves more devastating than a gun - if you chose it be."

You can go through the game making honest deals or being a ruthless warlord. You complete missions in a corporation through hostile means or through simple trades, and work your way to the top. Unfortunately, the playerbase is fairly small, the dev is slow (which is understandable as there is only one person working on the game), and the RDMers can be a nuisance.

I wanted to actually try the missions and play the game, but you can't because there are so many people that interfere with deals, or kill you out right in the street, or simply have nothing better to do then to ruin your day in a game that you want to chill in.I've tried for at least 15 hours to like this game but after trying 5 times just to get into the city dying each time by spawn killers, there is no way to make any actual money. I get you have to join corperations to make money, and thats fine, but there are no civilian jobs to allow you to make money. There are no mini games to keep people from getting bored and killing corp guys. Theres too much of a loss of cash when you die, but no penalty when someone actually does kill someone.  This game is supposed to be about deals, betrale and shadyness. I get that. but when someone just completely kills you such as a civilian for no reason, that should be punished. It should also be the same way when a corp guy kills a civ. Battles should be fought on civ and civ, and corp on corp, so people can acutally get stuff done.Out side of the rant, i really do like the games mechanics and lay out. Its simple, yet it has more steps then most games do, and it is really fun when you can get into a corp with a good group of people, but with all the ways that the community is treating things, theres no way you can actually complete things the way the game was ment to be played. This is a negative revew, I do want to give this another go sometime, but  yeah its defenently not at all ready.

It's not like H1Z1, which is only being worked on so they can squeeze their last few players dry by charging for cosmetics. This is a fully functional WIP. Everything is in place for the future, missions, vehicles, stocks, weapons, gunplay, dynamic movement, and a friendly community. I would give it a 1000000 / 10. Its seriously that good, you are an idiot if you skip trying this game and learning it. It might be hard at first, but when you get the hang of making friends, you will reach the top easily, even if that means, traveling around messing with the armed and unemployed."
,Not Recommended,272230,32094982,Posted: 31 May,all,Chief,"I would recommend. I support it and also a long time fan. It's a great game and concept. The only thing that prevents me to recommend is because the community (players in the main world server because there's rarely anyone in other servers) is increasingly toxic. You can be an unemployed civilian driving because you want to relax, then someone takes shots at you to cause random beef. Then when you die so many times, you'll soon run out. Another point to get at that bothers me is that the last announced (and big) update was 2 years ago. Since then, there has been no announced update that's a major impact on the game. All that happened from then to now was the moving of billboards and unnecessary glitches in the game.Overall, if you want to play this game, just beware most of the community is completely toxic and kids that don't know how to play correctly. You'll meet some chill people like me, d0ts, moist, and a handful of others that understand the gameplay and understand how to not be toxic. People like that get ""good boy"" points if you will. Boosts reputation. There used to be a lot playing before, now it died down. Who even knows what the developer of this game is doing.Quick message to the developer: Please give us bigger, announced updates and help prevent this community from going fully toxic and unbearable. It's hard to play with people that don't understand the game and gameplay. Another suggestion is for a more informable tutorial. You have to look at user made guides to understand and play the game (props to those lads giving us that information to learn from). Just revive this great game or sell it to some other developer that will update the game more often and make it great again.Hope this helps you deciding to give this game a go or not. I'm not trying to shoot down the game or anything, just trying to give others helpful information about the game. I will keep this game, not going to delete it. Hopefully we'll get something done in the future and all goes well."

I truly did, but in the condition this game is in at this state after two years and still a game that looks like it could run on computers from 2002, this game somehow is still poorly optimized to the point that fps drops constantly.I was also disappointed that after the years that this game has been in development that they couldn't even fix it to where guns shoot where the crosshair on the damn screen is.. even when 'true aiming' it doesn't hit the mark that it says it is supposed to. There's no control information when popping into the game and only lets you set up the key for talking, meaning you have to look it up or ask people ingame how to play this joke of a game.You could get a lot more of fun out of games like Roblox or Unturned, which both are free... asking $20 for a broken game with lack of replayability and no development plans is horrible to do to a consumer.. This is an obvious money grab and should be avoided until the one man developer actually pays for a decent development team."

,Recommended,272230,33342173,Posted: 7 July,all,Cody122450,"Sub Rosa could be one of the best multiplayer crime games, however, there are many problems with the game. Currently, there is an issue with RDMing (random death match). The game has become a giant race war. There are also problems with business deals. Some of the most beneficial missions is buying a disk from another company where you will be given a sum of money (based on the stock value of your company) to acquire the disk by any means necessary. The issue with these missions is that it's not beneficial for the seller and there's nothing to encourage you to get the best deal for your company. The developer is also very unprofessional, arguing with players on twitter. Updates are also slow and few, it reminds me much like Cube World which hasn't been updated in over 3 years. I understand it's a one man development team but I wish he would update at least a couple times a year, last update was over 1 and a half years ago.Pros:- Great gameplay- Freedom on how to complete missions (lying, betraying or being fair)- Realistic combat- Shows potentialCons:- Pentalties for RDMing not severe enough.- Problems with business mechanics.- Slow updates8/10 The game shows potential, I hope the developer can resolve these issues and make a good game into a great one."

,Not Recommended,272230,30823632,Posted: 29 March,all,SeventhSandwich,"This is, bar-none, the game with the worst quality-to-price ratio I've ever purchased on Steam.You may notice that my gameplay time is 13 minutes.This is the only game I have ever sought a refund for, and the reason why has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the graphics (although the graphics are terrible).I don't recommend this game because, in 13 short minutes, I managed to figure out that every facet of the gameplay is terrible. Read on, and I'm sure I'll convince you why.First of all, when I purchased the game, I noticed that the server list was almost completely depopulated. That was the first red-flag. This game appears to be getting a wave of purchases right now (many from people on my friends list), and to see the game almost entirely vacant was very jarring. However, I've enjoyed lots of games with small, niche communities, and there were two servers with decent playercounts.What you'll notice first on entering the game is that the sound quality is really, really bad. As soon as I spawned, my headphones started buzzing with this annoying, synthetic rumble that only played out of the right side of my earphones. It sounded like some sort of cheesy 1980s spaceship sound-effect, but in actuality it was a single-car box train that, for some reason, carries players from the spawn area 2 miles away, to the city where the actual game happens. Why? Beats me.So I hop on the train right, and while I'm doing that, I notice that my mouse is slow. Really, really slow. Like ripping my mouse through literal molasses. So slow that one swipe of my mouse across my mousepad only manages to move my character a single quarter-turn. I go into the options to take care of this, and low-and-behold, there is no option to change mouse sensitivity.In fact, there are basically no options at all.You can change the resolution of the game, enable ambient occlusion, enable 'cpu affinity', and that's about it.I walk around a bit to try and find some help from other players. It takes me about three or four minutes to find anyone because my character moves at 1MPH (I later discoveryou have to use the scroll-wheel to change player speed.Who the ♥♥♥♥ thought of that as a control scheme?). The first guy I find is no help to me. He merely yells at me in Portuguese. I try and reason with him and ask for help with the mouse sensitivity issue, and all I get is ""NAO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" ""NAO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" ""NAO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"".So I abandon asking him further questions, and I move on to someone else. This next person was a little more helpful - explaining that there is, in fact, no way to change the mouse sensitivity in this game. Instead, I have to change my computer's global mouse sensivity from my control panel to a number way, way higher than I actually want to use outside of Sub Rosa.While we're chatting, I move my mouse up to the sky, and sure enough, my character falls completely backwards like a drunken fratboy off of a Zeta House balcony. I stumble around like this for probably a minute or two, completely unable to regain control of my character. The helpful guy explains that you have to press space. So I do that, I jump, and I'm suddenly upright again. Why this feature took priority over a mouse sensitivity slider? Beats me again.I ask him some more questions, but unfortunately a wandering group of idiots with assault rifles come over and blast the guy helping me to death. I explain to them that he was trying to help me with the game, and I ask them about the control issues. They respond by telling me, (this is ad-verbatim btw), to ""eat♥♥♥♥♥♥you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;, and then proceed to ram me into a building, where I then get glitched into an enclosed area with no ability to escape. As they're driving off, they wish me ""good luck with that♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Real nice folks.Anyway, at that point, I realized that this wasn't one of those neat, jewel-in-the-rough games with terrible graphics but highly innovative gameplay. It's just a turd all-around. The client is barely functional, the controls are nonsensical, the features lack any meaningful purpose in the gameplay, the community is seemingly toxic to the point of ridiculousness, and of course, on top of that, it looks terrible.Summary of my review:Cons:-Controls make no intuitive sense at all-Has a bunch of seemingly redundant features that detract from gameplay-Community is toxic-Non-toxic members of the community get trolled by the toxic ones-Game client lacks the most basic settings for players-""NAO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NAO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥""-Game just looks really bad, overall.-Somehow manages to get sub-perfect FPS on my GTX 1060, despite having graphics sub-par even by 1990s standards-Apparently the developer delays the game development over politics? (From what other users have said here)Pros:-32MB download size is convenient if you still use dial-up or live in the year 1989-Would work great as a case-study for game design classes about what decisionsnot[/n] to make while developing a game."

It's essentially an sandbox version of GTA With emphasis on gang v gang missions. I played like ten minutes of the original sandbox game and saw it was dead. THEN i played some time in the new alpha and now it's a round based GTA? not sure where that is going but i liked the sandbox mode. It gave the opportunity for players to make stories and hold grudges against the red team. If they had just made the money the Gangs made gang accessible and not kept per person and focused more on that it would have been an helluva experience. But it's not going that way.

But, pulling of a dirty deal is EXTREMELY fun.Cons:- The fun of the game mostly stems from the community, which can lead to some bad things---ex. Had two guys join my team, hop in my vehicle to go do a mission, then teamkill me and my friend----UPDATE: If you find that the people in your server are just randomly killing, leave.

I've met some really friendly people that play the game often and they were very helpful in giving me more tips about the game!

If I'm being generous, about 40% of the time I was actually attempting to make deals and play the game and the other 60% of the time I was making the mindboggling boring trek from the spawn area and attempting to join a corporation after being RDM'd. It is apparent that this game will not be updated as much as it needs to be. Do yourself a favour and don't waste your money on this game. Even if it was super cheap or even free I don't think its worth spending the time on."

You start out in a corporation meaning power tripping isn't a problem and have one mission to do for the round, once that mission is completed or you die trying to complete it you wait for the timer to run down so you can get your paycheck/fine."
