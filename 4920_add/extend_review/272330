,Recommended,272330,17508595,"Posted: 12 August, 2015",all,Jaxxxson,"Absolutely love it, as many have mentioned, it will itch at your speed running abilities as the levels have a great flow and are very fun to complete.  There is also a level editor which is quite basic currently, but I imagine will be touched upon as the game updates.  The controls are perfect, favoring speedy executions, air dashing and my favorite wall jumping approach in any game I've played.  I highly recommend it if you're into pushing yourself through speed running or if you enjoy a good platformer.On top of this, the developers keep updating their game, fixing issues that happened to slip through the cracks of developing a game.  They're willing to update their game, so I am willing to update my review.  This company is genuinely trying to give you a great game, and I think they succeed all around."
76561197996990109,Recommended,272330,34200455,Posted: 12 August,all,DeadBabyJuggler,"This is a great ninja themed platformer with more of a focus on speed then stealth.Never heard of it until it popped up in my discovery queue a while ago. Finally picked it up during the last Summer sale. The story is...whatever. It's there. Store says it's ""Fully Voiced."" This is...untrue? There is sound effects during the story cut scenes but there was no voiceover. Found it odd. There's 3 different modes. Normal, Hardcore and Master Class. You unlock the latter 2 after completing the game on normal. The level design varies differently depending on what difficulty you're on. Overall the controls are tight but on the Master Class difficulty their flaws begin to show when you need to be a little more precise. The games forgiving though with lots of mid-level checkpoints.There's collectables in each level and then a handful of challenges to complete after the fact. The challenges aren't particularly difficult. You can probably beat them all in 15-20 minutes.Overall: Great platforming ninja themed game. More focused on speed than stealth. Just the right amount difficulty to be frustating but not anger-inducing. Controls are tight but sometimes not precise enough for hardest difficulty."

Were it not for the listing on Steam or their logo in the intro, you'd have no idea that the same studio that made Garshasp made this game- the margin in quality is that vast.Shadowblade: Reload is an action platformer with an emphasis on fast-relexes based around the small, yet versatile toolset the game gives you. Double-jumps, air-dashes, and LOTS of wall-jumping are the name of the day here. So there isn't a whole lot of variety in the actions you can perform- but the game is aware of this and thus enforces the need for a good handle on the nuances of these mechanics for players who want good stage-times or all the collectables. The controls generally do a decent job of allowing you to keep up with the pace of the game- though unfortunately they aren't perfect, occasionally glitching out and causing a cheap death here and there.There is also combat in the game- though it is much weaker than the platforming. Most enemies can be easily killed by just throwing shurikens at them or performing your sword attacks in time while charging at them. Now this doesn't work on all enemies- the larger enemy types tend to require more specific methods to be dispatched... In theory. That is until you realize that ALL of them- except for a single enemy type- are insta-killed by your aerial drop attack. Even without that knowledge- there really isn't much to the combat at all, making the combat arenas the game occasionally throws at you the most boring parts of the game. The surprising contrary to that are the few boss battles in the game- all of which are actually pretty decent.At least the animations for the combat are quite good as well- that's its main redeeming factor. In fact, Shadow Blade's graphics are quite solid overall for the most part. It runs well at a solid clip without losing a step and- again- has some pretty good animation for everything going on. The glitchy ragdoll physics and poorly done shadow effects are the main weak points. (I advise you leave shadows off in the options menu, they just don't add much and don't look good at all.)It should be noted that the game can glitch out in ways that force level restarts though. Bugs I ran into included getting stuck at the end of an enemy introduction cutscene, getting stuck in a ledge grab animation on specific ledge corners, and falling out of the level when standing on a sliding door. Nothing game-breaking, since full level restarts generally fix them, but still annoying when they come up.Overall a great pick for platformer fans. Especially for those who like them fast-paced and/or speed-run focused. Good value as well- with its campaign levels being playable on three difficulty levels and the game having a level editor with Steam Workshop compatibility.Pros:- Simple, yet versatile fast-paced platforming action- Solid controls- Well done graphics and animations- Surprisingly good boss fights (Though there's really only 3 of them)- Good amount of content: All of the game's main levels have at least slight alterations through three difficulty levels, and there's a level editor with Steam Workshop supportCons:- Somewhat buggy in places.- The controls are generally on point- but occasionally glitch out as well- Overly simplistic combat and enemy types"

Thankfully, the game was only trolling me and after you make your escape the map finally opens up. So far chapter 2 also offers 7 levels and there are 7 chapters in total, so yeah I think this might be ok for the asking price.About the game: You are a ninja. You kill people. You jump around. You collect ""stuff"". That's it. This is a point attack game. Try to get through the levels as fast as you can, while collecting everything, killing everyone and not dying. Thankfully you don't have to do that and can take all the time you want and die as often as you want. There are no lives, no time limits, nothing. And checkpoints are so far fairly spaced every few moments.Enemies die in 1 hit, but some enemies cannot be attacked from the front (back and top works though). Unfortunately, this also means YOU die in 1 hit. But thanks to the checkpoints not that big of a deal. The game plays perfectly. If anyone wants to create ANOTHER platformer, please ask these guys how to do the controls. The ninja controls flawlessly, wall, double and dash jumping from 1 point to another. If you die at the platforming sections you either made a mistake or you're trying to get a hard to reach collectible. Either way it's not the game's fault. This is no ""floaty"" Rayman. These controls are crisp and precise. You always feel in total control.Slicing up enemies feels satisfying thanks to the nice visceral style.The story is ""ok"" I guess so far. It's presented in nice comic book frames, but it's not really interesting. Standard far east ninja stuff. Looking forward to completing it."

Everything moves with beautiful fluidity.The controls are spot on too, as stated above I had a problem with the controller but a reinstall sorted that out and now everything is fine.  I press jump, he jumps etc.All in all this is a game I will actually come back to quite a lot, ESPECIALLY with the community designed levels from the level editor that comes bundled in the game, I can see this one lasting."

These people have obviously never played the other titles or maybe they just idled the game for cards and took a guess based off the screenshots?This game is a fast paced parkour platformer, it's actually closer to Rayman Origins than anything else. The game's all about how fast you can finish a level and how much of an item you can collect before finishing the level too.Overall, I found it to be more fun than Mark Of The Ninja but less of an interesting story. It's easy to understand why people would compare this game Mark Of Ninja when they first (since both have that graphic novel vibe) see it but when you actually play it, it's a totally different story.There's NO stealth element in the game. The enemies do not react to the environment. It's very basic and everything is simplified. It's not about sneaking, it's about running fast.Think Rayman Origins with Ninjas. Worth the money and a worthy addition in your library if you dig Ninja games."

,Recommended,272330,22487980,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,Truner,"I stumbled across Shadow Blade: Reload randomly before it was even out. Already looking quite cool, I noticed that Shadow Blade was on iOS, so I bought it. It had me so hooked, I instantly bought the Android version and simul-played it using Bluestacks. Later on, I completed both of them once again on newer hardware, and even the free version of the game called Shadow Blade Zero (Android). Bought this Steam release in early access and then bought it again on iOS and have 100% completed both. But why?This game is kind of like the love child of Strider 2 and Shinobi 3D. It's fast paced, focuses on platforming and minimal effort put into actual combat (you are required to end enemies ASAP). All of it is done extremely well, from the well made level design to the careful enemy placement. Everything just clicks.It also controls like a charm. Kuro is easy to handle, he can double jump, dash in air, use several different ways to attack, wall kicks when needed and puts many other ninja video game characters to shame.The music is catchy, but nothing to write home about. Ever now and then I catch myself humming some of the better tracks, but it could be better.The game is not perfect, every version of it (even the originals) has collision problems, stuff ending rather abruptly, enemies glitching up or spawning at incorrect places. Sometimes it can get frustrating. I don't care.I don't care because I REALLY, REALLY loved this game. There's no perfect video game but as long as most of the game clicks together as in Shadow Blade: Reload, I will enjoy it. Can I recommend it? Hell yeah, it's easily one of the best ninja games out there and if you like those, or are into retro games, this will surely satisfy your needs.It will last a while too. The game has three difficulty modes all with altered level designs and enemy placements, a challenge mode that offered some of the best thrills I've experienced in recent years (gaming-wise) and even a stage creation tool that also has the ability to upload it to the masses easily.I get it, this isn't really a review and it certainly doesn't help that I'm raving over this game. But look at that trailer. If you think the game looks cool even just a little bit, you should probably buy it. I doubt it'll disappoint.Still, I feel like this game was made for me. I have no other way to explain why I love it so much. It just clicks with me. Thanks for the awesome work, devs.This game gets the Ninja Connoisseur's Stamp of Approval."

Levels flow pretty well, the platforming is interesting, and it's very quick.That being said, Shadow Blade: Reload needs to decide whether or not it wants to be a platformer, or a more combat focused game. Drop assassination is the end-all-be-all of combat outside of the Iron Fist enemy which requires the even more succint dash attack. On top of that, the boss fights are not engaging at all, a lot of it is just waiting around for the boss to hit himself or destroy the wall to the next area - if you have this combat system, why not use it in boss fights where enemies can take more than one hit before going down??? In addition to this, you're going to get killed from off the screen a lot, from enemies with rifles, kamikaze bots, and especially homing rockets - honestly, homing rockets are alright in platformers but these last waaay too long. Following the vein of ranged enemies, Iron Fist, and the pink haired enemies have a ranged attack with next to no warning/indication of the direction they're going, why???Overall, I enjoy the game, it's entertaining, but I often have to set it down because it feels like the enemies in conjunction with the level design is just so random and stacked against me."
,Not Recommended,272330,21179720,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,CptChaos,"Nice and cool game. Only big downfall I've found so far is lack of good controller support as it lacks support for the X360 controller which I own and only seem to work with the XONE controller out of the box.Because of the weird controller support (the buttons to be pressed also differ from reality*), it's quite obvious that this game is actually a console port.Nothing wrong with that though, but no mouse in the menus at least? Come on!As for gameplay, I would actually recommend this game. It's easy to play and the enemies are easily killed in different manners too. But the things around it, kill the game itself a little bit.I also miss my mouse in the menu and I think it's kind of stupid to not support the X360 controller at all, although in the menus the controller seem to work?So I actually can't recommend this game, nor can I advise to stay away from the game. The gameplay is good, but some things could've been done way better, making this game an easy port from the Xbox One (guessing due to controller support) version of the game.I will revise this review when I see this game has been updated and has better controller support, which is a gamebreaker for me. Kind of.And yes, if the controller support gets better (it can't be that hard to add X360 controller support when an XONE controller actually is supported), I will definitly recommend this game to others.In conclusion:This is a nice game gameplay-wise and although it's an obvious console port, some things (like X360 controller support and mouse in the menus) definatly could've been done better.Will review my review when things will actually change; in the meantime, I set the recommendation to 'No', hoping the developer will notice the complaints and hopefully do something with it. It would be nice and much appreciated! Untill then, I'd advice to only buy this game when it's for sale or available for cheap somewhere.* Compared to X360 controller buttons, at least."

And, it does have a challenge mode, giving you a few extra stages to play, once you're tired of the story mode. However, this is all the game has going for it. As, the longer I played, the more problems with the game I spotted.For a game centering itself around speed platforming (with a little bit of action), the controls can feel quite wonky, causing you to do one thing, when you mean to do another. This is irritating to the player, yes. But, what's worse is the fact that the game is full of game-breaking glitches, that ruin the fun for any person playing the game.The two glitches I found myself running into the most were the following:1 - Passing through a solid wall, and out of the map, while trying to wall-jump.2 - Being frozen in my attack animation, after performing a downward strike on an opponent. That could only be solved by dying, or RESETTING THE ENTIRE GAME.These two kinds of glitches are damning to any game. Despite how fun it can be, when it actually does work. And, for them to be in a full release, that isn't eary access, or even getting patched anytime soon...That's just inexcuseable. As is the ""level creator"" that is in the game. For, not only does it not work at certain resolutions, but it's ability to create is pitiful. As you have so few creation aspects, that there's no way in hell to make anything that you'd want to make in this title.Long story short: ""This game does deliver some fun, but you'll be tossing it aside after about an hour or two, due to all the glitches. Plus the false advertising of a 'level creator' that doesn't even work.""Trust me folks, save your money, and spend it on something else you've been wanting.Unless this game is on sale for $1, do not buy it.Final Score: 4/10"
