76561198027620893,Recommended,272510,12140901,"Posted: 18 September, 2014",all,Captain,"This game should really be named Naruto Storm Full Burst Revolution 3.75. since there is no major continuation to the story line it is a typical filler from the creators of Naruto. Also there is just too much Chakra in this game with all these chars being brought back to life, it causes my game to crash frequently.  I also verified game cache multiple times still the game crashes.So after 14.4 hours invested into the game and unlocking every characterHere is my analysis.Pro's- Ninja Escapades was well made and no pointless running from place to place. ( This was the main story for me not the Mecha-Naruto garbage.)- Improved UI-Class types-Ultimate jutus allows use of your ultimate jutsu (which varies depending which support chars you chose)-Awakening allows for true awakening, Magnekyou kakashi, Sage Mode Jiraiya, Kyuubi Mode Minato, Control over the 9 tails with Naruto, control the 10 tails with Obito, Susanoo's for those with Sharingan and much more.-Drive mode Allows chars to seal 2 substitution jutsu gauge slots and their opponents Ultimate jutsu in battle. Also starts you off with full support drive ready to be activated from the start of the fight.-Battle arena 1v1v1v1-Chakra Rails in free for all are a nice touch. They allow you to ride around the arena using jutsu or shoot you into the air to come crashing down on opponents (each move varying per char)- The timeline is well into Naruto and everyone is super powerful.- The jutsu's are well created and aesthetically pleasing.-Cons- The main story line is based around Mecha-Naruto- They Removed the forward combo from all chars leaving them with only 3 combos a tilt and a throw.-Game crashes (some of them carry over from Full burst)(This is a problem with my system.)-Shisui Regular B combo finisher = game crash-Hashirama (First Hokage) Normal punch = game crash-Minato (Fourth Hokage) true awakening = game crash-Shikamaru Ultimate Jutsu = game crash (which is actually a problem that I also had with Naruto Storm Full Burst 3.5)I will post more as I find them.- Annoying obstacle chars ruin the immersion of a free for all ninja battle.- Free for all ninja battle in the story mode sometimes feels like a 1v3- lack of player control for 1v1v1v1's,(What needs to be implemented)1) Allow players to set up free for alls and control options in free battle tab.A) Allow 2v2's and 1v2's or even 1v3's.B) Implement player free for allsC) Allow toggle for obstacle chars/rails/traps/barrier for the arena- Needs more combos for True awakening chars (Kurama only has 1 combo and ten tails only has an arm smash and arm sweep.)- No Juubito11/10 because I love the characters of Naruto and being able to fight with them (especially with the new Team Ultimate Jutsu system) does make it worth it for me.But6/10 as a fighting game. Maybe.Someone came to me to ask about the controller mechanics. Having a controller absolutely does make this game easier to play, but is not necessary. I adapted to Naruto storm full burst pretty easily without the controller and only use the controller because my girlfriend bought one to use when she plays. But in my honest opinion Controller > Keyboard for this game.Shout out to Hiradragon She (or he) makes a very valid point with this comment. I still prefer games like street fighter though.Hiradragon - (かがみ) Oct 21 @ 12:37pm  DeleteThey have added a lot of subtle changes to make it more competitive (such as counters, dodge changes, combo cancels and more drive types). Sure the combos don't require you to memorise anything, but it is definitely a more skill based game than previous titles."

,Recommended,272510,14567090,"Posted: 20 February, 2015",all,Teram,"I like the game. Take this only for the multiplayer, since the story mode is boring as hell. Like every game of Naruto, its story mode is too easy, and even if set on super hard it will still look easy.Multiplayer mode, imo, is where this game shines.One particulary critic I will make however is regarding how the game was made. Almost all character models were taken from the previous Naruto games. there is no difference! one can only distinguish this from the other one on steam simply because here you can choose between true awakening, ultimate justu, but beside that there is nothing new. Sure, there are also new character, but I don't think that is enough to make the price go to 49,99€. I own both games and there is no change in attack animation, no change in the voice, and they even kept the same subtitles with the SAME grammar - and not only- mistakes !  (in the italian version 4 mizukage makes a grammar mistake and the Raikage, even if he says ""that's the power of the raikage, in the italian subtitles it says ""that's the power of the hokage"")  The same kind of errors appeared in both this and the other game, they didn't even bother to check them or to make something new. On internet is already possible to see how the next game will be, and again I already recognised moves already seen. I give him a positive vote but, as a fan of the series, I'm quite disappointed"

,Recommended,272510,12377194,"Posted: 5 October, 2014",all,F4rseeR,"Revolution is a game made for entertaining, not impressing. It is a fanservice, a way to spend time in an enjoyable way, not something that will cause catharsis. Is it good? Depends on how you look at it. As a fighting game, it's superior in every way for their predecessors. Still, there had to be a downside when compared to the old games: it has no storyline. Thing is, the game doesn't need one. I played it 100% to be sure of that. It has a lot of characters and even more sidequests.There's a whole island to free roam, new areas get accesible as you progress in the tournaments, areas where you can find characters, do what they request to unlock them. On the island you can also exchange medals to get accesories and you can try your luck at the lottery. The tournament mode is a lot of fun, it's well designed and the challange clearly goes higher as you go near the end of the path, the spot where your chosen ninja is acclaimed as being the greatest of them all. Best part is, it doesn't get repetitive. There are obstacles, enemy power ups, all kinds of things to keep you pumped.There's also a short story involving an abandoned concept, the mecha-naruto, a story which has some humour, some moral talking(you have to look deep) and an emotional end. It can also be considered as a NaruHina fanservice.One feature that should be noted is the Team Ultimate Jutsu, which actually makes the ""who's on your team) matter, as the strong combo involves the compatible characters do awesome stuff together.30 FPS lock kills the mood for the regular PCGamer, but you won't notice it, as it keeps steady and the actions are fast, flashy and quite spectacular. You can enjoy the combat by choosing what type of extra power your chosen characters will have, the league mode, another tournament mode and the survival mode, where some great challanges awaits.For the online part I'll say: same old, same old. I have to keep my finger crossed to get a lag free match. Good thing is, achievment hunters don't need to bother with it.As for the DLC, all are skin packs, the story is safe and tucked away for the next game.This is the first game I pre-ordered and I don't have any reason to regret it.The predecessor had a moving story. This one got everything else better, that's why I enjoyed it a lot more.It has a lot of content and most of it is great, this game delivered on it's promises. While many say it could be better in some aspects, as someone who played all the game has to offer, I don't give a f**k. A storyline would have made it shine brighter than Naruto in Beast Mode, but I guess they're keeping the best for last(next game just has to be that awesome)This game is a 9.4."

But with a few tweaks from previous games.1. No god awful story mode to unlock the characters, so no following the entire anime plot from A to Z  and taking 20+hours to complete. You unlock the characters by playing with friends In multiplayer. Which is better.2. You now choose to either have an ultimate jutsu, Awakenings, or ""drive mode"" (actively helpful teammates) So the uber cheese characters have been toned down.3. A short game mode called ninja stories which involves a few fights to unlock the antagonists with original anime quality cut scenes. Which was nice.4. Karin is still the absolute worst"

However, if you don't own a gamepad or XBOX 360 Controller, this game is nigh impossible to play. It took me almost an hour to beat the 3rd battle in story mode, simply because the Keyboard controls are so convoluted and hard to use. That being said, this game assumes you have an XBOX 360 controller plugged in, so all the movement instructions are in the format of ABXY commands (Which, on a Keyboard, are bound to L;PO by default). Good luck trying to figure out where the RT and LT buttons are. It took a lot of getting used to to play this properly, and the controls cause my hands to become quite cramped after a relatively short gaming session (about 30 minutes).The game itself, graphics, story, voice acting, characters and whatnot, are excellent, the models are well made and the attack animations are great. There are characters that are clearly overpowered, such as Bijuu mode Naruto and Deidara, as well as those that are severely underpowered, like Konan, but that's to be expected in a game set in the Naruto Universe.All in all I'd give this game a 7/10, if you're playing with a keyboard.If you have a controller or a gamepad, I'd give it an 8.5/10."
,Recommended,272510,12134801,"Posted: 17 September, 2014",all,Raito,"Do you want a good feel train with many hours of great Naruto story gameplay like on Fullburst?You won't be getting it.The ""attraction"" to this game is the Ninja Tournament game mode.You choose a character and enter a free-for-all tournament, in which you whack your opponents around like a bunch of badly disciplined cod kids.The tournaments consist of multiple stages and difficulties, ranging from D all the way up to S+.The goal is to go berserk on your enemies, which deposits their points on the battlefield in forms of glowing balls. The objective is to collect as many ""balls"" as possible while going ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on Sakura. The first difficulties are one sided slaughters in which you decimate your opponents like new born babies with a 10000-0-0-0 score and tell yourself ""bg, 2 ez, l2p noobs"" after the match.The story, which is the true gem of the Naruto games, is pretty non-existent.There's only approximately 1 hour of story gameplay.The story mode is entitled ""The Ninja Escapades"" which consist of 3 different chapters.The Creation of Akatsuki, which tells us how they gathered their members etc.The Fall of the Uchiha Clan, which tells us how Shisui and Itachi tried to stop the coup d'état.The Far Reaches of Hope, which is a movie of Team Minato featuring Kushina.The Ninja Escapades give an amazing animelike experience, which you can just watch on youtube if you're only in for the story.As I bought the game I didn't really know what to expect, the anime isn't that far from where Fullburst left us so there couldn't possibly be +10 hours of story gameplay incoming, still I hoped there'd be more to the story.The fighting system is pretty much like Fullburst with a couple new mechanics added, Guard Break and Counterattack.Guard Break is an attack that ""breaks"" the guard of his opponent, a stroke is executed by holding the opponent and knocking him down and leaving him unconscious for a moment, taking a break for the player to carry out a coup that further damage the opponent.Counterattack is used when an opponent is about to land an attack on the player, the players can knock them unconscious, rendering them helpless and sealing their support.As the game seems to be focused mostly on the Ninja Tournament, it really ruins it for me. I play the games for the story and not overall whacking and dominating my opponents to the oblivion. But as a fan of the series I have a hard time not recommending this game, but I do recommend you wait for a Steam Sale, as this game is definitely not worth 49,99€.If you're having difficulties choosing between this and Fullburst, don't fret over it.Buy Fullburst for the sake of the story."

,Recommended,272510,12114013,"Posted: 15 September, 2014",all,Poe,"Futher thoughts after more time with the game: Half the new ideas were clearly come up with by a gibbon. The story mode is a joke first of all. The Akatsuki Origins is interesting and takes about an hour. The Two Uchiha is also nice to see but was covered almost in its entirety by that Kakashi filler a while back adding in only a handful of new scenes and taking perhaps half an hour. The last one is a ten minute cutscene with zero gameplay and while it's still nice, I'm sure I don't need to explain why that's stupid. Then there's the one to two hour Mecha Naruto campaign that no one cares about. So yeah. The story clocks in then at less than four hours. No Tournament mode doesn't count because that's the same bloody fight with vaguely increasing levels of difficulty ad nauseum. I'd be disappointed if most indie games only lasted four hours much less a full priced game.As for the Tournament mode by its own benefits though, it's fun enough and changes up the gameplay a bit. But again the gibbon left his grubby fingerprints all over everything and added a bunch of moronic special conditions. My favourite of which is when enemy attacks ""seal"" you. That is; you can't use Chakra for a time. No one apparently explained to the developer that Chakra is an essential part of the game. So your only recourse at this point is to stand around like a lemon with your thumb up your♥♥♥♥♥♥ And this even applies to the free, long range and very hard to see coming and thus avoid Shuriken attacks. That three other characters whose AI only seems to target you can all throw. So you're basically guaranteed to spend that entire time wallowing in utter pointlessness. As well as plenty of other poor design choices and execution.This game isn't worth £40/$50. It's that simple. I'm not even sure it'd be worth £20. It's barely a move on from Storm 3 Full Burst and while it's still fun most of the time, it's the most irritating game in the series so far. Especially with the amount of on-disk DLC people have already found showing how far CC2 realy have fallen into expoitative, nickle and diming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Get this if you haven't got 3, but even then I'd say wait for news of a Storm 4. Which is a shame because there's a lot to like in this game too, hence why I still give it a recommendation. But there's so many little asterisks next to that recommendation and my anger isn't really with the game for the most part but at the developers and probably more so, the publishers who need to take a good hard look at themselves in the mirror. Which again is a shame because the developers at least seem like nice guys in interviews.Original review: I recommend buying this if you have more money than patience and you just can't wait to play as Sage Hashirama, Kyuubey Chakra Mode Minato, etc. or of course you don't own any of the other games. Otherwise, it is still only Storm 3.5 (or 3.75 if Full Burst was 3.5) - an improvement in many areas such as reworkings of old characters and quite a few new things but not really £40 worth of new and improved and as such I'd suggest waiting for a full on Storm 4 or at least a Revolution Full Burst type of deal. Having been with the game series from the start, this one feels more like it's a compromise between the first game and the later ones which is a good thing. Combining the refinery of the combat system and the depth with more elaborate combos and ultimates from the first game.In short, it's a good game but it's largely the same good game that is has been since Storm 2."

It’s fairly enjoyable but I only played through it once to be honest.Just like the previous one, the graphics look fantastic and faithfully translates Naruto’s world into a game. The options are little limited though. You can chose resolution, V-Sync, Super sampling and window/fullscreen. I think at this point I should note, the game is locked at 30fps, which isn’t a big deal, the animations are extremely fluid regardless.In terms of gameplay I find this one to be the best, they’ve included a few new mechanics like counter and guard break pill, and you can chose from 3 different battle types: Ultimate Jutsu Type, Drive Type and Awakening Type. It’s an attempt to balance the game but Drive type seems to be the best from all 3.There are new 4 player(You and 3 AI) battles that you can enjoy in the Ninja World Tournament, which get boring fast, due to the easy AI. It’s a shame that this can’t actually be played with 4 players.Other than that there is huge amount of content from a huge rooster of characters., customization items for your characters, cards, titles.If you are a Naruto fan, this is a must buy, plenty of fan service and fun to be found."

,Not Recommended,272510,12117512,"Posted: 16 September, 2014",all,Izeyash,"I am utterly disappointed by this game. I will hereby explain why:The game promised the, I quote, ""Story of the Akatsuki"", which was basically 5 minutes ofObito telling Nagato and Konan which members to get for akatsuki, with a few fights featuring the respecitve characters thrown in. That's it. I would have expected to see some more insight inside Akatsuki, for example telling howObito gave Nagato the rinnegan thus leading to the akatsukior some background story of their respective members.The second ""story"" part of the game featured Shisui's Story, called ""The Two Uchiha"" (if it's not the correct title, you have the permission to shut up). This is basically the same as I wrote above: 2 fights, 5 minutes of anime, end.The third story part contained no fights at all and was the most disappointing. 7-8 minutes of anime featuring Minato, Kushina, Obito, Rin and Kakashi talking to each other in a familiar manner (by familiar I mean the literal family). End, get achievement for watching an ova. Yay.Aside from the gameplay changes (which annoy me to the fullest, who would want 3 different types of playable character?! Storm 3 Full Burst was just fine!) I have nothing more to say. It's the same old launcher, the same old settings you can choose, damnit, it's basically the same game with community mods! Nothing spectacular happened in the time from Storm 3 Full Burst and Revolution, and still they want the same damn amount of money as last time! I call literal bs on this game, I deeply regret buying this game and If I could, I would refund it and get something more advanced. I understand that the developers wouldn't change something that works, but charging the same prize for basically the same game twice is completely unjustified.EDIT (20.12.2014): If I should rate this game it would be 9/11.

I can only recommend this game.I'm playing on a laptop, and not a gaming one in fact. So for me to still be able to run this without problems is perfect. So some of you with old pieces of sh*t PC's can also enjoy a tournament I suppose. And as for bugs some report. I've seen none so far.Now let's get to the details. The mechanic is almost the same as in Full Burst. But the step forward is the 3 battle types you can choose from.Ultimate jutsu - as for every charecter you can use the ultimate jutsu for pure power. But also with a full bar you can perform a team utlimate. Nothing special, it's all standard.True awekening - This is a great option. You can't use utlimate but you can become stronger in a pinch. If you play right you don't even have to go below 50% of your HP. This allows you to become stronger and use some hidden abbilities. For examples Hidan with true awekening can with LB create a circle and with RB you can spam to induce damage on your oponent without moving. And even if you move just reactivate a new field with L1 and viola. Death in spot. But ofcourse evry character has it's own true awekening with more power or different use.Support Drive - This one.. I haven't tried much. I only know if you fill out the bar you can perform a FREAKING SEALING JUTSU. With that you instantly seal 2 substitution logs, half chakra, the power bar (for one of the 3 styles) and such. Really gives you advantage in a pinch if you know how to play strategy in a full head-on battle.Characters are amazing, new ones bring interesting option.s Although unlocking them is hard as in tournament mode you have to go to them, complete their tasks and then you may play them. Some you win when you finish a tournament mode. Like 3rd Raikage on D tournament as a additional prize.I would surely recommend this game. It has potential to be time consuming.12/10 because 11/10 ain't enough."

I usually play the Naruto games to catch with the anime I don't feel like watching so when I played and discovered the lack of any story and the skip from 3 to basically the end of Shippuden I was unhappy to say the least.

Speaking of repetitive, the cutscenes and commentary would also have the same descriptor attached to it, where as you move up the ranks of the tournament there is literally no variation in cutscenes or the 5 lines of ""Commentary"" (which does not even apply to the battle mind you). The Mecha Naruto story is even somehow WORSE! Have you done mushrooms while taking a ♥♥♥♥ ton of adderrall? Because I felt like one of the producers did this and ranted to his father to implement this piece of garbage into the game for 5 hours until his will finally gave and put this horrid  content into the Naruto game! The story and gameplay is similar to that of previous Naruto games which is nice, a lot of running around just for a cutscene here or a battle there while providing some means to make me care...

In order to progress in this mode you are forced to tediously wonder around a miraculously bland open ended world.  If you were expecting the actual gameplay and combat to be as fast paced and intense as Full Burst then don't waste your time. Instead of utilizing the mechanics that worked last time they decided to adopt a very floaty combat system with the speed cut in half compared to UNS3.

The titular character (seen in the orange/blue jumpsuit, with spiked blonde hair) is one of the most recognizable characters in animation.Bandai Namco Games Inc. publishes at least one “Naruto”-themed video game per year. The newest offering is from the “Naruto: Shippuden” subseries and titled “Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution.” In layman’s terms, it’s a “Naruto”-themed ninja fighting game.Naruto UNSR Menu It's not the most technically advanced in the world, but the Japanese aesthetic is charming.The Good“Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution” has a gorgeous paintbrush aesthetic: it's reminiscent of famous Edo Period art. And it’s not just the menus that get this look -- the characters look hand-drawn, even during hectic battle animations. The game often switches between this anime-inspired aesthetic and scenes from the actual “Naruto” anime.Battles are ridiculous and fast-paced. There’s always an explosion happening or someone getting punched into the atmosphere -- it’s completely over the top, but the close-quarters fighting is entertaining, in a juvenile, basic way. There’s a lot of button mashing because your main attack is channeled through just one button, but you unleash a flurry of hits that happen too fast for you to recognize. Then you can follow with a “Chakra Attack” or “Ultimate Jutsu.” There’s another crazy animation, and you go right back to the action.All your favorites are here, each with an arsenal of theatrical attacks.There’s a ton of content to unlock, pages and pages of character customization accessories, finishing moves, outfits, and new character models. Plus, the fighter roster is north of a hundred. The characters aren’t that diverse  -- most still float around effortlessly, they’re ninja, after all -- but there is definite individuality. Naruto feels different from Sakura, Tsunade and even a younger version of himself. Other characters are similarly well-executed, and considering the vastness of the roster, that’s impressive.You’ll have to unlock almost all of these characters, but the game smartly places rewards at easy intervals -- you earn something every 10,000 ryo, and it’s really easy to earn at least 20,000 each battle.Naruto UNSR Bandai Namco included over a half hour of original animation in the game in the side quest mode, ""Ninja Escapades.""For devoted fans of the series, Bandai has also included a few original episodic stories, complete with new full-motion videos.“Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution” is a lot better than expected, and a ton of fun for anime fans.The BadBut it’s nowhere near perfect.Naruto UNSR Graphics You'd be forgiven if you thought this was a PlayStation 2 game. The overworlds certainly don't look up to par for 2014. Photo: Bandai Namco / International Business TimesAlthough the characters and animations are beautiful in battle, and the full-motion videos are commendable, the rest of the game looks terrible. The environments are bland, the texture pop-in is atrocious, and all the environment assets look like they’ve been recycled from PlayStation 2 “Naruto” games. One of these days, Bandai Namco might make a game that takes full advantage of gaming hardware, but today is not that day.Now, the combat system is worthy of priase, but its simplicity can frustrate fighting-game veterans. Fights aren’t decided so much by skill as by button-mashing; the circle button is the basic attack (no variation for kicks/punches, high/medium/low attacks, etc.), and most encounters rely on you getting in close and slamming the button repeatedly. There is “chakra” (special energy) -- that lets you power up basic attacks or perform jutsu/special moves. It’s difficult to do meaningful damage without relying on chakra, so all too often matches come down to jumping around and waiting for the chakra bar to recharge.Naruto UNSR Sometimes you can come back from an opponent's counter in the most satisfying way -- kicking them in the face. But you're still better off dodging instead of countering. Photo: Bandai Namco / International Business TimesThe game does feature counters, but they’re not easy to time. Plus, you’re better served playing keepaway and peppering opponents with projectiles until you get an opening: counters can set up big combos, but your opponent can always ninja substitute after the first barrage anyway, so you may as well go in swinging in the first place.The camera will make fights a bit of a mess. It focuses on a particular center point on the stage, tracking the back of the character in the foreground. That’s all well and good when your character is in the foreground, but when it’s in the background, good luck seeing much of anything -- you don’t even get an indicator above your head in one-on-one fights. You do get a small colored circle below your combatant in four-player melees, but with all the crazy action on the screen, it doesn’t do all that much good."

Story mode is bland and the Mecha-Naruto section is useless filler for what seems to be such a well designed character. The Ninja World Tournament is teadious and multi-player battles just don't work as well using this battle system. It takes the worst sections of Ninja Storm 3 and brings them to the forefront while ignoring what made that game so great.Under these additions however Revolution hides a well made advancement on the Ninja Storm 3 gameplay. There are more characters, namely a few favorites finally getting their place in the game. Team Jutsu's, new techniques, new stages and more collectables. In some ways it feels like a cash in. The new story and tournament mode used as an excuse to sell a new game in the series while adding very slight new features for fans of the older game. It isn't poorly made at all but it just isn't an enjoyable experience, especially with Ninja Storm 4 already out on Steam.I love this series and I enjoyed parts of this game. But chances are you wont ever see the end of tournament mode unless you're extremely dedicated to the franchise. Because this mode hides most of the unlocks for characters.

I cannot, however, get past the laziness of the voice actors when it comes to ultimate jutsu's for the new characters or the unknown reason as to why it was they didn't bring in sound effect files from the previous game for things like the normal and ultimate jutsu's. I bought this for free battle, but the lack of the proper sound files makes it sound like crap. The most obvious one's are Hinata's 64 palm's move making no sound whatsoever and the lack of the charge up sound for tailed beast bomb. That's just jarring.

It is extremely laggy and still has transmission error problems. Full Burst was barely playable, but somehow it got worse in Revolution!!I have beat the tournament mode (the ""equivalent"" to a story mode in Full Burst), it took roughly 7 hours (including the ninja escapades) except this game was much easier compared to Full Burst.As said before, this is overall a solid improvement over the last game with many more playable characters. Expect this game to take roughly 7-10 hours to complete the tournament mode + ninja escapades and a couple more hours to do the pointless sidequests which do not yield any major rewards. Multiplayer is unplayable and they probably will not fix it (just like they didn't with Full Burst, however I really hope they do).____________________________________________________________________________I am going to compare the game to it's Full Burst counterpart and will have my review for that game down below this review. Basically this game is everything I wanted Full Burst to be and more.Free Roam is much much better, there is still some quick frame drops happening for me, but not anywhere near as bad as the Full Burst free roam. It is actually much more fun too and there is more of a purpose to it in this game than Full Burst.Graphics are improved as well, the cutscenes were great in Full Burst and same goes for this game (looks exactly like the anime). Overall everything graphic wise to me is improve, from the free roam maps to the in game characters. Great Job!The new 4 way combat mode is great, not only are they pretty quick but it is not laggy at all even though there is a lot going on and locking on and off and switching between targets is pretty flawless in my opinion.The main game I think is longer too, I have not beaten it yet, However I beat the Full Burst story mode in roughly 7 hours, im a few hours into this game and there is still much more to do.More playable characters, enough said about that one.Awesome new Ultimate Justu when teaming up with the correct support characters, which was not in Full Burst.New customization feature for characters which is cool beyond just customizing substitution justu in Full Burst.TL;DR Full Burst was a pretty good game but this is awesome. Much better overall and well worth the money and support.-----OLD Full Burst Review-----If you're getting this to fight people via the online multiplayer, do not buy it. Over half of the matches you will play will end in a ""transmission error"" because of the broken servers they use. The publishers also do not plan to fix it anytime soon. If you are buying it for the story and the characters then go for it, it is a fun game with a 7-10 hour single player story line with plenty more to do after you finished it. Also there are tons of playable characters and follows the anime (However if you are not up to the 4th great ninja war arc there will be spoilers).I DO NOT recommend this game because I bought it for the multiplayer and it barely works and if it does it is extremely laggy. If you plan on playing it for the story, yes it is fun, but save $40 and just watch the anime. The only thing going for it is its fun gameplay (besides the often pointless and laggy ""free roam"") and the vast amount of characters you can choose from."

,Recommended,272510,13022327,"Posted: 20 November, 2014",all,Dusty,"This is one of those games I'm highly indifferent about. Looking back, I wouldn't call this game a bad game at all, in fact I quite enjoyed it. The ""story"" is comprised of four short stories with some (easy) fights peppered in that expand the lore in the naruto world through the story of the Akatsuki, Itachi and Shisui, a unique story about the new character ""Mecha Naruto"", along with a 10 minute movie about team Minato which I quite enjoyed. Overall, this will take maybe 2-3 hours to complete. Which is quite  a bit less than I'd expect for a game with such a steep price tag. The replay value is unfortunately nonexistant unless you are looking for the two achievements given for achieving S ranking on the Itachi and Akatsuki mini story lines. However, if you didn't already get these achievements on your first playthrough as these fights are quite easy, you will without a doubt get it on your second. There is also the ""Ninja world tournament mode"" which I enjoyed quite a bit. In this mode, you can select a character of your choosing (with the exception of all the young characters, which kinda sucks) and duke it out in a four-player brawl against NPCs. Unfortunately, there is no online mode for this. This is really awful since like the rest of the NPCs, they are quite easy to defeat, and offer no real challenge. I will admit by the S+ tournament I was sweating a bit at the intensity, but the difficulty is entirely due to major NPC buffs in the form of a constant ""true awakening form"" and not a more advanced AI. That being said, I still won it on my first go-around which really ruins the fun of the game. This will most likely take about 5-6 hours to complete (basing off my own time). And overall, you'll get about 7-9 hours of gameplay out of the story if you play to completion. Such a small playtime leaves something of a bitter taste in my mouth considering the price tag of this game. However, if you're seeing my play time, you'll notice I have 100+ hours in this game as of writing this review. This is due to this games' bread and butter, the online mode. However, unfortunately enough for the online mode, the online community has depleted in the two months since this game has come out. This has made finding someone to fight almost a chore and you really have to just open the game and cross your fingers that you'll find someone. Speaking from personal experience, now that the game is about 2 months after launch, it is a very common occurence that you will find noone to battle.Near the games' launch, the online was solid and all you had to worry about was a tiny bit of lag since so many people were on the servers. However, even now that not so many people are using the servers, the lag is still existant if not worse. This is a huge no-no in my opinion for a 1v1 fighter to have any form of lag. Especially to the point of making the game near unplayable at points. This raises a secondary issue in the fact that even if you manage to find someone to play against, that person might have a laggy connection and make your game either near impossible to play, or make your game crash entirely. In total, this game was very fun. But now that the main focus of this game, the online, has fallen into an abyss, I would advise against purchasing this game. Still, for all the fun I had, I think this game is great. 8/10, buy it if you have a time machine or you love wasting money for a couple hours of fun.Edit: Some grammar corrections / spelling"

The main reason for this is the lack of a proper story mode. You do get an interesting side story of the founding of the Akatsuki, but it is far far far to short. If they had expanded on this and shown the story of the anime from the point of view of the Akatsuki (the bad guys), it would of made the game so much better.Past that the game does nothing wrong in particular.

But bare in your mind that the game is still 30fps capped and as usual CC2 being lazy to add pc related settings to in-game, I mean come on guys. Also this have the same bare minimum settings that was present in Storm 3 which is very lazy of CC2.This is a direct port from the Xbox version and nothing more, just like Storm 3 but smoother. No more screen tearing thanks to vsync. Looks more like a polished version of Storm 3 with few different things here and there tbh. Game seems to be more targeted on competitive fighting than story modes.Although for me online is partially broken at the moment, not even a single match is working from the lobby and lots of transmitting messages before cancellation of the mate. Matches work okay if you add create a session or join a session with a friend so a certain extent, still input lag is there. I was not looking mainly to play multiplayer matches but it is disappointing. Also I don't understand why CC2 and Namco cannot give Asian servers for people from Asia, we too get connected to EU servers instead of Asian servers it seems.There are 2 story modes, one is Ninja World Tournament and other is Ninja Escapades. There is no canon story that follows manga with this game which is disappointing. Also must say single player modes are a joke compared to Storm 3. In NWT mode there is another story mode for Mecha Naruto which imho is a complete farce, waste of money and time. Mecha Naruto character is good but the backstory looks like its a fanfic written by a 12 year old. Escapades mode is okay but still its gets over very quickly and that's it.So far Ninja world tournament has been interesting and gets less fun once you have to do tedious mini missions(answer for Iruka's stupid questions, run around the island and fight team Guy, delivering lunch packets as Mecha Naruto are some) for various ninja so they can be added to my roster. 4 way brawl battles are good but always ON lock on enemy is annoying and can result you getting hit by other contestants but other than that mode is somewhat refreshing.Other than those issues as a pure fighter game this game is really good, they've improved from Storm 3 in that department. I didn't went in with much expectations tbh and so far game runs good. Definitely smoother and polished than Storm 3.Buy this at full price of $49.99 ONLY if you are a die hard Naruto fan \ someone who really can't wait for Storm 4 and needs their Storm fix or a huge fan of 3d anime fighter games, otherwise wait for a 30-40% off sale at least cos in my honest opinion this game and its content does not deserve the full AAA $49.99 price."

,Recommended,272510,12308429,"Posted: 30 September, 2014",all,Udkedae,"Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution (that's a mouthful) is a great fighting game. The visuals in this series never disappoint, and the tweaks made to the gameplay make it a solid fighter with a bit of strategy set into it.(Please note that this doesn't cover all there is in the game. This is a review of what's important to note in the game)First off, the combat. The previous game in the series (Storm 3) had a great mechanic where your support would act according to the type you set for each one of them separately (auto, attack and defense). The possibilities back then were limited by your skill saving up chakra and attacking in coordination with your support characters to fill up the Storm Gauge. In Revolution they've changed it so you choose one single type of combat for your team. These types are broken into:Ultimate Jutsu Type:Allows you to perform an Ultimate Jutsu alone or in coordination with your 2 teammates if your Storm Gauge is filled to the top, however you can't access Awakening or make your teammates attack with you in a regular combo.Awakening Type:Allows you to access the Awakening state at any time during a fight and True Awakening given your Storm Gauge is filled up. The downside to this is you can't use Ultimate Jutsu and you still won't be able to use your teammates in a regular combo.Drive Type:Keeps your teammates with you at all times in three different forms: Auto Drive, Defense Drive and Attack Drive. Auto Drive makes your team attack with you during combos and deliver a final blow into your opponent by the end of a regular combo and often protect from Ultimate Jutsu aimed towards you, Defense Drive provides defense from your team when charging chakra or being approached with a Ninja or Chakra Dash, and Attack Drive works pretty much like Auto but without your team taking hits from Ultimate Jutsu for you. This type can’t use Ultimate Jutsu or Awakening mode.All three types can use Jutsu no matter the type and support during team battles.New to the series is a single player mode called Ultimate Ninja Tournament. In this mode you and 3 AI controlled opponents fight against each other in the same arena. It's a competition for orbs which are dropped each time a character takes a hit, this will decrease the amount of orbs held by the victim and increase the ones held by the attacker. There are no health bars in this mode but taking a hit when your orb count is at zero will leave you off the battle. The fighter with the most orbs at the end of each round wins. There are of course many hazards in these arena battles, on top of 3 enemies that could gang up on you at any given time.It's a fun mode that would replace the Story Mode in a numbered Ultimate Ninja Storm game, and while it's not story heavy every aspect of it nods towhat ifstories with lots of fan service content.Another interesting aspect to the game is the customization. Online Ninja Cards make a return for this entry but character customization is a most welcome add on to the game. You can choose up to 3 accessories to be place on your character's arms, face, back or waist, a substitution item to replace the generic log, and 1 of four Ultimate Jutsu Finish screens for each character. All of these items are unlockable through Ultimate Ninja Tournament mode and by fighting Network Clones online.The Ninja Escapades mode lets you play through short anime stories exclusive to the game. The little story they tell goes from gameplay to anime seamlessly, a nice touch that makes it enjoyable as short as it is.At the end of the day this game's perfect for those people who like the anime, games and wish to do some fighting online and/or locally, but if you're looking for an epic battle conclusion to the events after Storm 3 you're going to be disappointed (though the character's dialogues are set up to that point in the story arc, which could come as spoilers to those who haven't kept up with the series at some points).Pros:Massive character rosterDiverse customization optionsThe new combat allows you to truly see the type you chooseFan service all over the placeCons:The team types are great but not perfect. Some are unfair in the right hands.You can't put accessories on special outfits (Anbu, school, warrior, etc.)The story is there but you have to dig to find itHints:Learn the basic and new techniques before heading onlineMake sure you try every character to know what you're fighting againstNeverfight someone online if your connection is at 2 bars (let alone 1)After completing it to 100% I definitely recommend this game. The fan service, the visuals, the music, and the amount of content I did not include in this review make a solid game in the series, and a must if you can't wait for the next numbered entry."

DBZ and Naruto are my all time favourites and I've been watching them since I was young. Because of this I've generally bought most releases for both franchises and looked at them through rose tinted glasses.This time however is the first time EVER I'm actually sorry I bought the game, Here I'll list why;- There is no story! It's just 1 Island where you enter the same tournament 6 times with increasing difficulty. It isn't canon, it doesn't make sense and it's reptitive running around doing pointless ""fetch this from the other side of the map and bring it back"" quests- You have 3 side stories which last maybe 4-5 fights... History of the Akatsuki (so many inconsistencies with this story I don't even think it's canon), a story about Shisui/Itachi and the coup (nothing here), and Mecha Naruto which is quite frankly... terrible- For exisitng characters, the moveset hasn't been updated since UNS2 (at least the DBZ Budokai series did this), it's so tiresome seeing the same movesets and animations if you own the other games- Not THAT many new characters. Yeah they added the Jinchuriki and some updated Edo Tensei characters but left out 7 Ninja Swordsmen, Gold and Silver Brothers and some others who are still only support characters like Cee, Chojuro etc (again same movesets)- You can complete the ""story"" (tournaments) in 1 day and unlock all characters however to unlock all items it would take you about 1000 years. The completion time does not scale with the playability! You would just be grinding and grinding and grinding away for minimal rewards like accessories and probably wear your controller out before you got them and by then they will have released another one.I'm not going to write too much more on this because it doesn't deserve a full review, it literally should have just been an update or dlc for UNS3 Full Burst. I had never listened to naysayers before this game, now I wish I had. Stick to playing previous versions, watch the VERY few new animations on YouTube in about 10 mins and that's all that's changed in the game and save yourself £30 odd quid!"

Ninja World Tornument is the most boring single player of any game I have ever played, the ""4 player free for all"" Is actually ""3 v You"" which gets very old, very quickly. Sure they took away the stupid Hack N' Slash from Storm 3, but other than that, and the increased number of characters, this is no way an improvement. While I can see the appeal of splitting up Ultimate, Awakening and Support, it doesn't feel as impressive as Storm 3 where you could use all 3. Also, Kushina. Oh dear. Naruto's mother Kushina is one of the most badass females in all of Naruto, she also uses a unique jutsu involcing chakra chains which has been shown to hold down the 9 tails, so in this train wrek of a game the decide to give her a frying pan for a weapon, because that isn't sexist what-so-ever..Summary: Buy Storm 3 instead, this is horrible."
,Not Recommended,272510,12129383,"Posted: 17 September, 2014",all,SirMadame,"DO NOT BUY.Worst purchase of the whole year. Judging from advertisements and trailers, this game could be considered scam.* NO Story mode besides 3 (VERY) short stories, which are done in under 1 hour.* VERY bad connection. The networking code of this game is horrible. Even if you have a perfect connection, depending on gamemode, you will share your connection speed with your opponent (meaning if he has lags, you have them too).This can result in battles being interrupted all 1-2 second by about 0,5 seconds with ""loading"" popups.Joining other people's lobbies will almost always result in a grave disadvantage for you due to noticable delays.*Only 4 gamemodes:1.) Online battles, which I described above.2.) World-Tournament mode, which actually is a mode in which you battle 4 times in each rank from D to S to be crowned best of the world. You can complete extremely short missions between the battles to either gain new comrades (must be done again for each character... ... ...) or to get some money (which is earned much much faster by simply bashing the A.I. in the VS mode over and over and over again) and items...By spending this money on any item on any shop you gain lottery tickets that are your main source for character customization items. It all comes down to a long grind that rewards you with a diminishing chance for new gear.3.) Free-for-All -> This is your Local VS Mode, either with friends or the A.I. (which is no match at all)4.) Ninja-""Escapades"" the sorry excuse for a story mode. Only 3 arcs of which one is just a cinematic with no content worthy to mention. All Episodes together have less than a dozen battles... I mean, c'mon.*The well anticipated character customization is broken down to choosing an outfit for your character (for example Naruto normal suit, non-combat clothes or samurai armor) and then sticking 3 items of your choice on them (you can choose upper left/right arm, face/masks and upper/lower torso on your back) - NO colour customization, NO renaming, NO haircuts.>>108 chars to choose from and they couldn't include a simple shinobi editor<<--> Huge disappointment.Oh well, you can choose from a wide variety of objects to use for your replacement jutsus (dodge mechanic in this game)... Doesn't matter that about 50% of those options is the normal one with a japanese Kanji-tag on them (SO mesmerizing...).[Kanji is one of the japanese ""alphabets""]*Each character has only 2 Jutsus: a normal one which knocks down your opponent (for example Rasengan for all Narutos) and an ultimate Nin-Jutsu which is a cinematic driven finishing move, which can be customized to include one of 4 short, voiced sentences accompanied by a static picture IF you finish your oppenent with it. (These 4 options must be unlocked via the lottery or gaining money)Depending on which outfit you choose for your character, these two jutsus differ (but only slightly most times, for example Naruto either uses his one clone Rasengan, Double-Rasengan in sage mode or his Rendan as pre-shippuden Naruto [Rendan is a humourus melee-combo utilizing his shadow clones])*On top of that are horrible, childish dialogues[---this game, even though you can toggle ""violence"" does have no blood whatsoever and all dialogues are cut down to ""are you happy?"" -no -> let's do something about it -> You DID something about it! -> you are my new BFF!---]*And ridiculously common loading screens, you will have to watch the loading icon after almost every action, this is NOT a joke, here is an example:[PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THIS WAS TESTED ON A TOP OF THE NODGE NEW COMPUTER; I EVEN MOUNTED A RAM DISK FOR JUST FOR THIS -> FASTEST POSSIBLE DISK ACCESS]::: You start the game, of course, it loads. 4 Logos (skippable), intro ""cinematic"" (skippable), loading screen, select game mode on main menu, loading screen, select action in submenu, loading screen (for this example I choose World Tournament mode), now you choose to either load your save or start a new game, LOADING SCREEN, skippable cinematic, skippable cinematic, loading screen, unnessecarily long dialogue with Shizune and Mabui at the beach. Now you can walk across the beach. From one end ot another it takes about 15 seconds run time... but still entering another areal of the tournament isle will start a LOADING sequence (at least this one is only about 1-2 seconds). Opening the menu has a severe delay of about 2-3 seconds, entering ANY subcthegory of this menu will show you a LOADING SCREEN. :::You get the idea?In addition to this, canceling out of most submenus will throw you back at the main menu for that game menu, even canceling out of a submenu will start a loading sequence...*And last but not least, several characters are severely imbalanced. Picking Deidara for example will yield you a win in about 80% of all fights by simply spamming your Kunai(ranged attack)-Action (Deidaras kunai special is a quickly spammable explosive-clay-bird barrage).*The only positive things about this game are1.) the massive roster of choosable shinobi (as said, 108), including all known kages, Madara, Obito (Tobi) and many child-versions of the Shippuden characters2.) the new network clone feature where you can customize up to 3 shinobi A.I. characters from which you can send out one at a time to gain levels and bring back items for you. The higher the level, the better the item.These clones are uploaded into a cloud and will appear randomly in games of other players (in world tournament mode these will stand around and wait for your challenge, in online mode, these will randomly appear after a fight and challenge you).Beating these clones will reward you that character, including their equipment. (Getting that badass greatsword to carry on my characters back from a random fight felt awesome... but that sword cannot be used, it is only decorational)I will say this as clear as I can: DO NOT BUYP.S.: If you only want to buy this for the playable characters, unlocking all of them only takes about one day of continously battling in any gamemode (If you win with S-Rank most of the time)."

The counter mechanic needs to be taken out in storm 4, it ruins the flow of the game and all you need to really do is spam that counter to win. Plus, they only added maybe 12-15 new characters,the rest are the exact same characters from the previous games with unedited movesets that make it seem like you just bought the same game twice but with barely any content added. Now finally the 4 player tournament mode is just a mess, it's hard not to get frustrated to do one simple combo on one of the fighters without getting attacked by OP characters in the tournament every 5 seconds. This type of problem doesn't occur until you get to the B ranked matches in world tournament. Once again the online services are mediocre since there is lag constantly in every fight you play against someone in, this is dissapointing because you think that CC2 would learn from storm 3 full burst, but if anything the online is the same if not worse.

I cannot say that I am disappointed.

This game is a must play for gamers who enjoy Naruto. The graphics are the best yet and the gameplay is the best the series has had and I have played all versions and every storm game made. The online is working and is just as it is in the console version  if your pc meets the requiements and you have a decent internet connection.I cant recomend this game enough I am glad I preordered and it was even made available earlier than expected. I still have not beaten the game after a few days and there is much to unlcock.  The real bread and butter is the battles and online battle modes and everything works just as it should. If you follow naruto and or just like anime fighters this is the one for you. I hope they make all other Naruto games on pc from now on.

The new characters are amazing and I pretty much can't stop playing this game. I have already put over 44 hours into this game and it has only been released for a little over three days. I'm not a fan of online so I have no idea what it is like, and I don't plan on knowing. I strictly stay with having a bunch of friends come over to play the game for hours on end.I have played this game non-stop and I still haven't finished all there is to offer. I do feel the the challenges are quite repetitive, but still good. The Battle Orb tournements I feel is a bit broken. I would understand why 3v1 happens to me when I have over 6k orbs, but when all four start with 1k and all three are still coming after me, it becomes quite annoying.Another entertaining thing you can do in this game is set up artificial boss fights in practice mode with the specific characters. So far the flaws I have found in this game are as followed: During free roam random characters eyes will glitch out causing them to go big and small constantly. Another is that some of the accessories don't fit characters very well causing them to glitch through the characters body. My final complaint is character specific accessories. I was really hoping you could have a really wide range of accessories, but all of the really ""cool"" items are character specific. This was kind of a let down.All in all, I do recommend this game to anyone who is a huge fan of the Naruto Series, or likes slightly strategic storm-based fighting games."

,Recommended,272510,12135055,"Posted: 17 September, 2014",all,Chaos1224,"To everyone who is complaining about the games lack of a story mode....THERE WAS NEVER ANY MENTION OF A STORY MODE EVER!!!! This game is a filler game, so that the developers would have more story to work with NS4. They did the exact same thing two years ago with Ninja storm generations. The only reason this game exists is so people will have something to hold them over until the next game comes out. So now that we got that out of the way, here is my review on the steam version of this game.Pros:-Improved combat systems. I play with gamepad so i cant really comment on how it is with M/K but the gamepad is smooth and plays great. They have changed things up a lot since NS3 so expect to be surprised when you start up a game. First and foremost there are 3 ways to play each character, Ultimate jutsu user, awakening user, and drive user (team battle only). Ultimate jutsu users can use their best attacks but wont be able to awaken, awaken users can awaken but cant use ultimate attacks, and drive users will rely heavily on their team mates and wont be able to awaken or use ultimate moves. The new system may seem weird to some people, i personally think its a good system. It mixes up the feel of the game and makes each battle a little different especially when playing online.-The tournament mode. Its great. I dont care what anyone says about it being awful, it really is the most unique thing the developers have done to this game that changes the gameplay so much that its actually worth replaying. The way the tournament is set up is, you have 4 teams. Each team has 3 members, and each has 1 person battle at a time. Each match will have 4 players fighting at once so it can get hectic. During these battles, there will be enviormental hazards and scenary that you can interact with to help hurt or help players win the battles. Outside of the battles, wondering the island holds different character events and different challenges to complete. On top of that, there is a story mode for the new mecha-naruto character. Its not that great of a story or that fun but it is there.-More characters-More stages-new music-can unlock characters outside of story mode buy earning money from battles. In case you hate the new tournament mode.-offers japanese voice options for characters and subtitle optionsCONS:-laggy. In combat there is no notice of lag at all, which is why i recommend this game. It is a fighting game afterall and thats where the core of the gameplay is. Outside however, the frames stutter pretty badly, characters will pop in and out even at close distances and it is especially distracting during the animated scenes where your better off skipping them.So thats it for my review. I really recommend that you get this game. If you are a fan of naruto and fighting games this is a must have.Edit: oh and if you are expereincing a slow down in the combat, turn off super sampaling. In fact, just leave it off. It doesnt add anything to the game and unless you have a powerful rig its just going to ruin your experience"
,Recommended,272510,12299006,"Posted: 30 September, 2014",all,NZ Denom,"I finally beat the game. The Escapades, Mecha-Naruto Story, The Tournament and the Ally Events. (But not all of the Challenges and Jobs, those are mindless Time-wasters.)Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution was the most entertaining filler in my opinion. It made me laugh, cry (Literally..), and also made me.. very angry at times (that wore off after a while).The first thing i started with when i got this game was the ninja escapades. The anime scenes were quite entertaining, and felt like an actual episode of Naruto Shippudden. I like how they got rid of the quick time events for the cutscenes, i just wanted to sit back and relax after a fight i had won, I got that.. and more.The Akatsuki Origins were fun and easy to blast through, and it was fun to watch the cutscenes that played between each fight. The story of the Akatsuki origins in this game starts at the point where Deidara and the rest were just getting recruited and not before the Hanzo incident. Itachi and Kisame's joining wasn't included as well.The Itachi/Shisui Storyline was Incredibly entertaining to play through and watch, revealing facts and expanding on who Shisui was, and it includes some bonding between characters that.. I hate to say it, made me cry.. The good feels, ya know?After you finish the first two escapades, you are rewarded a short episode with team Minato, with Kushina.Now to the Mecha Naruto Story.. *sigh* Basically the type of story that was used in this has been dragged through countless arks and fillers.. Mecha naruto feels like an outsider, a freak and alone, and he feels just like Naruto did in the begining Bla Bla Bla. I'm not sorry for being harsh towards this story with Mecha Naruto, My feels were depleted after the legit Gaara story. It got less appealing to watch when it was recycled for Sora and Isaribi.Finally we get to the Tournament part. Basically, you mash buttons untill you win, in a 4 person arena where you collect orbs that Drop when you hit enemies and drop boxes.. Have fun repeating that untill you get that Ultimate Steam Achievements!!.. the game awards you small accesories that you can't equip unless you're playing as a character who's wearing their main costume.. Ultimate Customisation my a-.. sorry.While I enjoyed the Ninja Escapades A Lot, the rest was mildly entertaining at best.Because I played the Rise of a Ninja and The Broken Bond Games on the Xbox 360. I was not pleased with the free roam.. it was an annoyance, it was not fun, it was slow, it was lifeless, with the most boring side missions that included running from point A to B with fights thrown in.I'd give this game a 6/10. My scoring relies on the fun i had in the ninja escapades, the character roster, the lazy attempt at trying to appeal to the free roam thing they forgot that people wanted, and the Ultimate team moves that were thrown in for awesome fan service.My suggestion for the next game is to bring in some F@$%ing Voice acting!! This isn't a PS1/PSP game, Jeez. Pressing the prompt button to get the next speech bubble was Irritating, I was interested in what the characters had to say but in this case, the characters were hollow and without F@$%ING VOICE!!!!And please expand on the Free Roam (as in exploration and worthwhile bonuses, similar to UNS1 and The Xbox 360 Exclusives), you got the fighting mechanics down 100% and i am Greatful for that!! you can put some of your efforts elsewhere too now!!"

76561198046310643,Recommended,272510,12141335,"Posted: 18 September, 2014",all,Kalkiru,"Let me preface this by saying I have been playing this title largely on my PS3 (which is why my play time on the steam version is really low, don't worry I will definitely be fixing that).With that out of the way, lets get into the review. This game is a solid game and a decent addition to the storm series for a few reasons, though it is held back a little by lacking story content to a large degree. To be fair, there hasn't been much story progression from the anime/manga since storm 3, so I'm not really surprised to see them offer more filler based content in this iteration.The story content is based around 3 very short 'escapades' that involve some animation in-between battles, these backstories revolve around the Akatsuki, Itachi and Shisui Uchiha and Kakashi's former team mates when they were younger. There is also the Mecha-Naruto story line, although I wouldn't count that as much of a narrative, while funny and slightly heartwarming, its execution was a little lacking and isn't much of a story by itself.Beyond the lacking story content however is where we get to the meat of the game, and ultimately, the part where it shines the most. That would be the gameplay. While not too much of an overhaul, since this game runs on the same engine as the previous title, new battle mechanics as well as offering meaningful choice in how to play your characters really do add polish to the system.Within this new system, players are offered the choice of 3 different types of set up for any given character, these types are Ultimate Jutsu, Awakening and Drive. UJ allows your character to perform their ultimate jutsu, and when their storm bar is full (a new mechanic) they can peform a team ultimate jutsu that executes a combo before their UJ is done. The upside of picking this is that UJ is much easier to land when using all the members of your team as a proxy for the technique (if even one of the 3 characters connects in dash, the technique is cast). For the Awakening type, you can do just that, anyone picking this has access to both Instant Awakening and True Awakening. IA has its advantages for both comboing attacks and also adding strength to the fight when you need it (balanced by reducing max chakra, thereby making it impossible to awaken breifly after using IA). True Awakening if actually used in a fight adds a lot of extra power and in some characters cases an almost boss-like presence on the battefield while in this state, this is something that can really turn the fight around. Drive types revolve around teamwork and automatic support, in order to balance not having either IA/True Awakening or UJ/team UJ's anyone using this type can count on automatic support as well as switching support focus during battle, on top of this supports knocked out during the fight may revive after a period of time has passed. The drive type's only trump card is the ability to seal both UJ's and Awakening types abilities for a short period of time.Also of note, in this iteration of the storm series, customisation has been added, you can now edit your characters looks with accessories as well as their Substitution item and the video that plays upon a successful UJ finisher. Allowing both visual customisation, as well as focus choice really lets someone play how they would want to play, obviously its not the most in-depth customisation system, but it is a very welcome addition to the game.Adding to this is some new battle mechanics, along with the usual Sub/Guard defence, a counter mechanic and guard break attack have been added, these new mechanics are balanced by their use of resources (reduction of max chakra for counter and ammo system for guard break). With these, and all previous options from the last game, as well as character focus types, present a lot more depth within fights than was seen in storm 3. There are now few more options for both the defending and attacking player, which leads to more interesting fights overall.Of course, all of this is to speak nothing of the visuals of the game itself. It is quite a beautiful game, the style of the characters is very faithful to the animation style of the anime, and the environments to fight in are just as great to look at as the characters themselves. Add to this the technique animations, including the new awakenings/Special team ultimate jutsu's and this game certainly does not disappoint on the eye candy factor.I have very few issues with this game, but there were a few things to stick out. Firstly, while the ninja world tournament mode is great, and a fun diversion, the amount of redundant content is a bit too much. There are challanges and 'jobs' on top of recruitment quests for this mode, and while recruitment quests aren't all that bad, there are aLOTof jobs to be done. Case in point, there were at almost 20 jobs for each rank of the tournament I have been in so far, and a vast majority are just the standard 1v1 with supports or the 4v4 orb brawl mode with only one or two being anything different and all of these fights have no real story context. Add to this the challanges of each rank and you have a sizable list of content to get through. The trouble is that it all feels quite repetative after a while, leading to the realisation that the developer added these almost grind like elements mainly for the completionists and to give longevity to what would have otherwise been a short mode.All in all, here are the pros/cons for this game.Pros:New focus types/Customization add to personal choiceEnvironments and characters are as beautiful as everAwakening/UJ/Team UJ animations are awesomeNew fight mechanics on top of old help to make the fights more interesting than the last gameNaruto and Sasuke Swapping outfits had me fanboying a little, smart move CC2Shisui Uchiha and Kurama mode Naruto as playable characters? yesplsCons:Lack of longer story content could upset a few fansRedundant content in the Ninja tournament mode is a little annoyingWhile I enjoyed the Mecha-Naruto story somewhat, I can see why a lot of people couldn't take his addition to the game seriouslyDanzo existsIn summary, this game is better than storm 3, gameplay wise and I suppose graphics wise and is a solid title in itself, but the lack of story content may irk some fans (though it doesn't bother me to much) and the amount of redundant content in the nina world tournament mode may get on the nerves of some completionists.I give it, 7/10."

I've had huge trouble playing online for this reason and it's somewhat difficult to find people to play with.

I'd love to use the classic characters (when they were young) to fight characters like Jirōbō, Tayuya, Sakon/Ukon and Kidoumaru but we can't cause they are ""support"" only characters, at least we can use Kimimaro but why can't we use the rest of them? Some characters like Anko and Kurenai are not even playable! Many of the characters that should be playable are not, Shisui is playable but not them?It's a really good game but it's not what It should be, I really hope they will make another Naruto game on steam and this time it will be the story with every characters playable and also it would be nice if it could be the whole story from Episode 1 to the latest Shippuden episode.I can't stand the fact that characters like Anko, Kurenai, Kidoumaru etc etc... are not playable, also the story, it doesn't even continue the original story so I'm giving it 7.5/10"

Mecha-Naruto is Ech at best, and not worth the extra time put in to unlock it. In the other game the awesome fights are set up FOR you, and these fights have choices, extra mid-fight scenes, etc.In general, the other game is more fun. I played this for a few hours and got VERY bored, whereas Full Burst on ps3 I had 100%ed. And what the hell is up with most characters? They all fight very similarly and are grouped into different classes, as I see it - ranged, close combat or OP-as-♥♥♥♥-kills-everything. Balancing was done, but it sorta takes away some of the fun.And the part that pains me most? £40. Wasted. It should be around £25, maybe £20. £30 at a push, not more.

,Not Recommended,272510,12237150,"Posted: 25 September, 2014",all,Bloo,"Major online lag, lack of story and a feeling that there should be more content other than the massive amount of characters keeps this game from being more than ok to the general public. I can already tell you I only love this game because of the Naruto part of it. The Ninja World Tournament mode and Mecha Naruto story were both short, had a small amount of fights, and weren't too intresting. The ninja escapades (OVAs) had very few fights across the three, but I suppose that makes sense. They should've really just been extras you could've unlocked, like the ultimate jutsu videos. They had a nice story though...despite lasting around 40 minuets for all 3 combined.The actual combat featured in the game is extremley simple but fun in my opinon. If you like hitting the same few buttons in same manner for each character, you'll find the game fun. Don't go looking for Tekken or BlazBlue levels of complexity levels here. The character  roster spans over 100 characters, but each plays exactly like each other with few differences. For example, one combo might send the reciever farther into the air than another character, but it won't make too much of a difference. The only major difference between each character is their jutsu and it doesn't help too much to differentiate every character that well. ""Why should I play as Asuma instead of Mecha-Naruto? They're exactly the same for almost everything but one move."" Online is very, very laggy, and you shouldn't play this game for the online, just the offline.I thought the game's anime style is beautiful, despite having looked exactly the same since Naruto: Ultimate Ninja STORM on PS3 way back when. They really don't need to change it because it looks just like it is a 3D anime, which is what the game is aiming for.In conclusion: Don't get it  unless you like Naruto, or have had a run through a demo. Wait for a sale on it if you're on the fence. I would recommend this to my friends because I enjoy it, but THEY might not enjoy it as much as me unless they like Naruto as well. Stay safe with this one."

There's a LOT of characters to play from either Season 1 or Season 2 (shippuden). Nice combos, great music, and even new stuff like fusing your supporting character's ultimate into your main character's ultimate aka a teamwork based finale ultimate. There's even animated cut scenes made by the people who work on the anime themselves, and it goes into the past based on Akatsuki to Obito's childhood. Was great seeing those clips.But ....The game falls flat on story mode. You only get three of them which are very short. Then you have the World Championship which involves you hitting your opponents to collect the most orbs. It's kind of pointless and lame to be honest. Online mode has hardly anyone really playing, let alone doing ranking mode, to leaderboard mode. I have great connection but still had difficulty finding anyone to fight against. The rest of the game is lacking on terms of game modes against AI's along the fact there's not much else to it. For a fighting game, it feels it could of been more. I still enjoyed it, yet... overall, it could of been better apart from the mechanics being improved and great cutscenes done in the anime fashion like the show.

It's mildly infuriating. I just Rage quit after trying to get through this one scene with Itachi and Shisui 3 times.If the game ran at 60 fps and didn't constantly freeze up during the god damn cutscenes it would be great.

One is how far his sword goes when blocking and pressing ""B"" his sword doesn't seem to reach the distance it looks like it reaches, and when I use the flick + ""B"" combo, it hardly reaches as far as just about any other flick + ""B"" combos for any other characters. and when you start to hit things you can't chakara dash at all for a small though stupidly long compaired to any other character (at least in awakening) and there are alot of times where (In awakening mode) his giant fire ball attack misses even when it should of hit, probably because it is a straight and fast attack but it should not be as easy as it is to dodge it. In short, I think awakening mode is broken for him, or at least bent to the extent it that needs to be fixed, and the range of the flick + ""B"" as well, needs to at least be widened (since it can result if you hit someone, to summon the giant susanoo). But other than that, the game is pretty good with the fighting and stuff, the story seems a bit repetitive and boring at times as well, but otherwise a pretty good game in the Ultimate Ninja STORM series, though i've only got to play the 4th one a small amount and none other though. Alot of stupid bs happend just recently and now i do not recommend the game because of it, the com enemies can predict what you do before you do them, and com enemies also for some reason can go through rashomons in some cases as well."

For the 40 dollars I payed for it, it is NOT, worth it.Bascially, there are 4 highly...negative reasons why I really dislike the game, and two of them are actually gameplay mechanics that just ruined the game to the point I have uninstalled it, and will probably end up deleting it from my library and getting a refund.Point 1. Graphics. Honestly, while graphics are ""good"" Their almost exactly the same as the LAST game, there's no real increase here, and on top of that, almost all the characters look the same, and handle the same. This should be a Patch to the last game, not ""resold"" as a brand new game, because there's not a lot of new content here.Point 2. ""Custom"" character. Yes, you can customize your own character, just like Xenoverse!...wait, I have to use a regular Naruto Avatar, and I can't actually change anything, the only thing I can do is Add things? Sure, giving Naruto Shukaku's tail is funny, but for a ""character creator"" this was really half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥done, and more dissapointing then anything, plus the process of unlocking things FOR this creator is REALLY, really hard (as in you will pour HOURS, into trying to unlock a new tail, or hat, and even then, tis random chance if you get it, making it highly frustrating). At least Xenoverse gave you a set mission how to unlock something, here, you have to play a lottery, and HOPE you happen to get a usuable item out of it.Point 3. Storyline. The storyline while....interesting, was also Extremely short. It took perhaps 2-3 hours to complete at most. I was sorta hoping they'd have a good story, not something that I could clear in such a short amount of time.Point 4, and this is the point that just made me quit for good. World Tournement. (And ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI programming). Honestly, this is just stupid, frustrating, irritating, and Extremely difficult. The tournement comes in different ""levels"" of difficulty. And you have to unlock characters by doing quests inside the ""tourny"". Overall, another irritating mechanic, but that's not what was upsetting. The tourney is basically 3 battles of 4 people going at it, so you create a team of 3 members, to duke out those 3 people with 4 other teams. That would be an interesting mechanic, except the Ai, especially at higher settings, WILL NOT TARGET ANYONE ELSE. That's right, it quickly stops being a free for all, and turns into a 1x3, ""AI attack player"" strategy. I got into the B rank of the Tourny, and won, before I finally said Screw this.Having 3 players constantly attack you is irritating, annoying, and makes the game Very hard to play. On top of that, because you actually have to UNLOCK characters by playing the game mode, you can't even use people you want IN battles. Personally I was looking forward to playing as Pain, but even after rank B, still don't have access to him.Overall, this was a highly frustrating experience, and not worth the 40 dollar pricetag I paid for it."

My favorite was Storm 3 by far and I had VERY high expectations for this game. So far I have about 2 hours in and I tried every type of gameplay. The world tournament seems EXTREMELY bland, the ""story mode"" for the akatsuki was extremely repetative. (Oh go here. Confront them. They deny it. Fight. You overwhelmingly win. They join from their own interests.).All said and done the new features in this game are nothing to look at. Now getting down to the core gameplay most people end up playing which is free battles of all types. You're going to get what you expect which is a traditional Ultimate Ninja game, but the ultimate justus seem VERY anti-climatic and dry. Using a character like Pain and having such a mediocre jutsu is a laugh. I do think you can unlock more through playing parts of the game though, have yet to get to those parts.Overall, disappointed with my experience so far, but I'm not giving up in the game. As a fan of Naruto it takes a lot to really through me off for a game and there's still fun to be had here. Just don't go into this game expecting the AWESOMELY cinematic story more experience and thrilling free-battles we got out of Storm 3."

Well i never had a problem with it, never crashed, never had a single problem with it. and i played a lot of it offline with no MP.when i tryed the online, it is dead, but that is to be expected of fighting games now days, unless it a massive fighter game like tekkin or super smash you have to expect it will be dead at least 2 weeks after launch. as is the fate if the last Storm, and DBZ games....So this is where i start to get negitive:when i bought this game i assumed that it was going to be like genirations, where it went back in time and then bought us back up to speed with what was going on, and a little extra. It was pritty obvious that it wasent going to be a hard core story line game like full burst ( and even that only added on).....BUT NEVER DID I THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS CRAP!!!!*the campain has NOTHING to do with the storyline, rather your on a tordament island where you rank up, and guess what? you do the same thing AGAIN from d rank to s+*There is how ever a mecha naruto campain which is a story line to its self with no actual tie in to the main story line* this is a another mode that has three 15 min mini game which is the only part that was linked to the story line which to be fank if you wanna see them, go to youtube, its not worth the money...*the new game mode pits you and 3 others agaisnt each other to collect orbs, which is boring as well and locks you out of the cool attacks  unless you get a orb that give you the ability then who ever get hit with it gets heavly damaged... so its like having a fight with one leg cut off, sure everyone has there leg cut off, but if you where watching it real life, it would just be a dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fight.Sure it has way more characters and dont get me wrong, i do enjoy it when im playing the normal 1v1 modes with mates, but if your thinking of taking the fight online with like listed above, is useless...I am quite disappointed with this game as a whole and even as a fan of the storm games i would sugest getting naruto full blast, sure its older, less characters and probaly less chance of a online fight BUT*its cheaper* it has a storyline worth a fue good hours*i personaly enjoyed it better than this oneBut i can only give you a insite as to what i have played :D"

76561198062262254,Not Recommended,272510,16658749,"Posted: 23 June, 2015",all,Ninjuh,"TL;DR: A lack of story mode and less-than-acceptable servers keep this release from greatness despite many gameplay improvements from storm 3. The naruto storm series from generations >> onwards shouldn't be overlooked or slept on because of percieved ""gimmicky"" combat centered around ninja movement and it's yearly releases.  The very mechanic of ninja movement/dashing contributes strongly to a solid fighting metagame centered around good spacing, timing, reading, baiting, bar observation etc.Keep in mind, as a yearly release this is a ""filler"" game. There is no story mode to be found here, this is made by a team of 170 otaku japs who're paid to produce this yearly; they create filler games like this and Generations in order to test new mechanics and smooth things out for the main releases. On that note, I have high hopes for storm 4 which will likely be worth buying as a naruto fan simply for the story mode gameplay just as Storm 3 was.This game is very enjoyable when learned and played with narutofriends irl. However, for this game in particular, if you're going to be playing online only you'll have a bad time due to sub-par servers and a lack of people playing with half-decent connections anymore. Because of this and a lack of story mode, I can't reccomend Revolution.For fans of the series, I would say Storm 2 and 3 are worth purchasing for the story as the cel-shaded animation is superb. The boss fights manage to capture the feel of the manga while, in my opinion, outdoing much of what studio Pierrot does in the anime.And something I feel needed to be addressed about this series for fighting fan critics, a defense of the combos: ""There's only 3 combos for each character"" is a very poor excuse to overlook this game as a fighter if you really enjoy them. Don't knock it before you try it, and I would reccomend looking at some of the higher-tier online gameplay videos to get a feel for how this can really be played. The 3-combo-system is also all centered around set up. Hit him onto the ground to keep him close, knock him back to gain some distance, throw him into the air to make him vulnerable. It's all about the movement.Also, many of the combos have some very tricky things throughout them.For example, some characters throw ranged weapons at specific points in their combo which can then be used to catch your opponent and rush in for a combo. In addition, each of those combos have particular moments within the moves which can be interrupted by ""rushing"" in at the intervals which may then be counter-countered by your opponent if they read your rush correctly.If you're really that critical, I would even reccomend simply pirating this game and playing it on single matches and then teams with a friend. You will more than likely start to see what you're missing."

If there wasn't any loading/traveling you could probably beat this game in one sitting.I'm not against OpenGL but DirectX has come along way...Each character has 2 unique Ninjutsu moves and about 4 different combos and 1 unique grab. Some of them have unique support with Ultimate Ninjutsu. That said, the characters only favor either being direct or indirect aka range.Small reasons you might want to have this game:It offers local multiplayer.(Only up to two!)Online is 4 players.It features your favorite characters from the series (almost all of them.)You do need a controller for a better experience."

This next game in the franchise is going to have all of that ramped up to the max and a ton of new features to set it apart. The previous game was highly modded and this game should end up the same in the end adding many more hours to the hundreds that you will be putting in after picking up this epic game. And with the multilayer mode and many different characters to chose from it is a great game for even people who are not fans of the series, but be warned after playing this game you will be! This game will be taking place around the current Naruto Shippuden subbed episodes and into the manga chapters directly following, so try to skip the cut scenes if you are not far enough in the series yet to avoid spoilers, and many of the battles in the game are from the series but they often will add or take out battles from the series to better fit the game, nothing bad enough to ruin the story for the people who already have scene it but enough to avoid to many major spoilers for new comers. If you wish to start watching or reading now hear are links to the start of the three viewing forms of Naruto.Dubbed:http://www1.narutospot.net/watch/naruto-1-dubbed/Subbed:http://www1.narutospot.net/watch/naruto-1/Manga:http://www.mangapanda.com/93-1-1/naruto/chapter-1.htmlBut if you want you can start here without any real problems with the story because most of it is explained and most the series is not directly affected by the original but I highly recommend starting from the originals to get the full story, but again none of this is kneaded to play the games an still have a lot of fun while your doing it.Dubbed:http://www1.narutospot.net/watch/naruto-shippuden-1-dubbed/Subbed:http://www1.narutospot.net/watch/naruto-shippuden-1/Manga:http://www.mangapanda.com/93-250-1/naruto/chapter-245.htmlAll of this is ongoing with the manga about one hundred episodes in chapters longer than the Subbed and subbed about one hundred episodes longer than the dubbed. I have done all three and the only difference between subbed and dubbed content is length but both shows have fillers in them that the manga does not have but are still considered cannon, much like some of the content that will be in this game in the form of flashbacks and other cut scenes. And all of this is still ongoing but saddle the manga is going to end sometime late 2014,leaving the amine to catchup but still giving us marginal content with fillers and there is also a movie and other content coming out not based solely of the manga."

Because of the absolute lack of plot within the game. The 4-way battle sytem has grown on me, rahter because its provides a minor change of pace from constant battling. Overall the battle mechanics are great, though I would have prefered that characters had access to all battle forms as in the previous game, not just, jutsu, drive or awakening. It helped with the sense of OP characters prove why the had the right to be OP. (Nagato tears)"

When I bought this game, I had the same problems I had with Ninja Storm 3 after I upgraded from my old Radeon HD 6950 1GB to a Radeon R9 290 4GB. From what I've gathered, these games do not run well on GPU's with a clockspeed that is too high, and will then run at a framerate as low as 20 FPS at worst. When in a fight, it will vary from 25-30 FPS. This not only means stuttering animation, but a lowered game speed as well, because the game speed is bound to the framerate, as is common practice in fighting games. I recommend this game to anyone with a slightly weaker system. If you DO have a stronger system, and decide to buy the game regardless, there are programs that can fix the problems. If you google ""ninja storm revolution framerate"" you'll find steam threads that can help you, although some of the instructions leave out some vital parts, so keep reading further in the threads."

At least there are 3 scenarios that play out a little like mini-anime episodes. And the other tournament, Mecha-Naruto story, is about a couple chapters worth of campaign.Multiplayer is still hit or miss with connections.You can create/customize an enemy that will appear in the main tournament island for people who are online.

Ninja Storm games have always been overwelming to new players but with Revolution's new twists on the older mechanics and a completle lack of a tutorial this game seem like a gumbled mess to the uninitiated.However vetrens of the series will welcome many of this games new changes such as teaming up with your supports to do new team ulamite jutsus, the addition of new characters to the roster, And the most important change of all is now players will have to chose between their ulamite attacks, awakenings, or having their teamates provide additional help in battle adding a new layer of strategy to teambuilding.The game's main campain is Meh and the Mecha-Naruto story falls somewhere between a poorly written fanfiction and the anime's filler episodes so don't expect a great single player experiance outside of free battle, but thankfully online battles are just as fun as ever. Players can fight in ranked matches, compete in tournements, or create and train a network clone that is essentialy an npc that can challenge other players.Overall this game can be extreamly fun IF you know what you are doing.

World Tournament mode is a thrill, and the Ninja Escapades which is basiclly story mode is entertaining... With a few fights in The Akatsuki Story, two fights in Shisui, and NONE in Obito's which I think is kind of lame. They do offer Free Battle mode, Online Mode, and World Tournament mode outside of the Ninja Escapdes mode though. World Tournament is a four man/woman battle. You start at D rank mode, and work your way up. First match is free for all, and after that you have to hunt down a partner on the tournament island to help you.edit add: So I just wanted to add I played 15 hours now, and found you can get mecha Naruto story if you beat world tournament the first time, and its highly worth it to seek out accessories if possible. You can make some pretty epic looks. In Free battles you can do League, and Survival mode. There is also a special type system ultimate, Drive, and awakening. Awakening allows for constant awakenings, Ultimate allows use of ultimate, and Drive makes you more interactive with allies, and they often protect you from ultimates. Bringing together allies on your team creates different effects. Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura will get you the three way summon. So basiclly its based on who is on your team that makes the special and yes these specials replace your ultimate jutsu. So becareful cause your characters REAL ultimate might be better.Its got a good set up so far, and for those of you who are looking for a keyboard layout here is something just for you!Start: EnterBack: Right shiftY: AA: SpaceX: ZB: XLeft stick click: XRight stick click: right controlLeft back: QRight Back: ELeft trigger: WRight Trigger SLeft stick up: upLeft stick down: downLeft stick left: leftLeft stick right: rightRight stick up: TRight stick down: GRight stick left: FRight stick right: HDpad up: IDpad down: kDpad left: jDpad right: LIt works for me, and may be abit confusing, but basiclly it will work like...Q, and E for summoning partnersW for sub jutsuS for blockingA for chakraD for meleeZ for throwing ShurikenI,J,K,L are your itemsF,T,G,H, are your changing target in world tournament moment, or simply turning the camera.Oh and I forget to mention the space bar becomes your jump button.Enjoy this amazing game!"
,Not Recommended,272510,34569366,Posted: 28 August,all,SnubbyKing,"I bought this game when it first came out and I've enjoyed it for awhile, but this is not the best one in the Ultimate Ninja series. The reason why is that the game has its own type mode for every character, which never happened with the previous games. I guess they wanted to try something new with the series, and that's fine. But.. it's really bad.First of all, this game keeps crashing on Windows 10 everytime I try to select a certain character. Either it's the operating system, or the port is absolutely terrible. I'm sick and tired of seeing lazy ports like this. It's also locked in 30fps, which doesn't really bother me at all. I wish they could patch this game and fix some of the issues, but I highly doubt they will.I don't hate this game at all, but it's one of my least favorites in the series. I did enjoy my experience customizing character with many accesories and the tag ultimates. Even though there was no story mode, they did introduced the origins of how the Akatsuki organization began and other timelines. They also added a wolrd tournament where you can fight 4 characters.I had a hard time recommending this. If you're a Naruto fan like I am, then check it out. If not, do not buy this game at all."

This game is not worth $50, to me it should have been a sort of DLC adding the charaters that Full Burst didn't have like the Reanimated Hokage, Unmasked Obito, Madara with his fan, etc. Don't waste your money on this game unless you get it for a HUGE discount price from a sale then MAYBE it'll be worth paying 50% off or better yet 75% off"

The added 'special stories' are actually pretty interesting, and I really enjoy the replay value with the tournament mode- In fact, I'll probably be playing for quite a while.If I had a criticism though, like most others posting reviews, is that this is truely not a sequel as we've come to understand the word as- yes, it has many charecters that came out after Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, and Full Burst, but as many are saying, this really just feels like a DLC. For starters, there is no story mode- which, until today, I was lead to believe that there, in fact, would be. I was slightly dissapointed in that fact. For instance, if you bought this game alone and none of the other most recent releases, you'd be missing out on playing the story mode, which I know many people playing this game look foreward too.HOWEVER! This review is a recommendation, and not a negative comment. WHILE some of those key elements are missing, this game is still more fun than it's predecesors in gameplay and combat mechanics. The new formation modes are a fresh take on the traditional 'use the biggest jutsu first' situations- in fact, there's a formation that will cancel out those huge jutsu's! Beyond that, the animations are visually stunning as always, and the huge charecter roster is quite impressive. Besides, I've already heard that they were going to add more, of course in DLC's, but I in fact will buy them. While it's not the game I was looking for, I will play it eagerly- I preordered it 5 weeks ago damnit, and I'm not gonna stop playing because it's not what I was expecting, especially if it's still fun and enjoyable!

,Recommended,272510,12213970,"Posted: 23 September, 2014",all,Kenuty,"Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja storm revolution is a much more improved version of its predecessor in the mechanics, Taking out the parts of the game that was unnecessary such as that hack and slash gameplay and putting in more emphasis on fighting, online play and balance of the game, while suffering problems with a lag at times. However, the game sacrificed most of its epic music, story, and cut scenes(except the mecha naruto storyline which has all this) features drawing fans right down the middle. Those who are looking for a game with new mechanics, more balanced system this is what this game is about. For those that wanted a story mode, it's better off to get fullburst. Both games, however, still seem to suffer from network problems though you are likely to get better connectivity in this one.During the start of the game players will be able to browse four modes - Online battles, Ninja's world tournament, free battle, and ninja escapades.The story mode of the game is ninja escapades. To understand the story of the game players will have to play the previous version full burst, read the manga, watch the anime or look for various resources to know exactly what is going on in the series itself otherwise, prepare to be dumbfounded in this series. The game has a seriously short story mode which had its story nicely picked and exclusive. However, can be beaten in 1 hour and 30 minutes making truly short and a letdown. However there is also a Mecha Naruto sidestory in the ninja tournament mode which seems to be the main story line in the game. Previous fan looking for more of the story that is canon will be disappointed to find there is almost none in this version of the game and gone are those epic sequences and music like in fullburst.The ninja tournament mode is a single player vs three other CPU controlled characters in a free-for-all where the fight is a brawl type to knock each other and earn orbs to progress through a tournament ladder to obtain tons of unlockables such as costumes items, jutsus, ultimate jutsus, items, and cards.Players will also be able to send out network clones and have it level up toearn items and xp along with battling other network clones that appear. The mode itself has nothing to do with the story on the anime but is filled with roaming gameplay, voiced mini events, lotteries, sub quests to unlock characters, mini games, and secrets to be found through orbs.After winning the first ninja tournament mode the Mecha Naruto side story will open for a small adventure with a plot. As you progress in the ninja world tournaments more of the world opens up for more to explore and unlock.Free for all is a mode to test and play with what is wanted so that new players can understand the combos and characters to find, which is the best combos for them along with getting the mechanics of the game down. There are 118 characters to choose from to mix and match along with one or two supports to choose from for each setup.Online play also has an assortment of new options to choose from such as ranked, private matches, endless mode and ninja war mode are to name a few. Though the game is played through the network by who hosts and can sometimes be laggy making it truly hard to pull off some counterattacks and guard break if this happens, afterwards it just becomes a spam fest between who can hit what and to predict the future as moves are inputted 5-10 seconds later. If there is a good connection, then it gets really fun. The multiplayer seems to be much better in matching player's skill levels and latency but there is still the problem with lag and transmission EVERY TIME NOW.The game itself, however, had its mechanics improved and that was the highlight here. The support system is reworked and evened out, There is a guard break mechanic in place along with a guard break item, and with a counterattack move to really change things up and help solved some of its imbalance. Before a fight players are able to pick from three different style type, UAD, (ultimate jutsu, awakening, or drive type) where the game lets players concentrate on one of the three aspects in the fight.The game fighting is often more smooth on the inputs, and the game feels considerably more refined when played. This game is very easy to play and understand on the mechanics but very hard to master and takes some real skills when it comes to fighting others of different styles. Players will have to experiment with many combos to find the one that fits their style or the best ones. So yes, spammers and such can be beaten. The game was created to be fun to play and not really something to be taken too seriously as it is a game created for fun for anyone of all ages.If you are a die-hard Naruto fan, this is a must-have for you, though if you are looking for the previous story mode that full burst offered you will not see that in this one because again it is focused upon the fighting mechanics, unlockables and online play(which is lagging nonstop). Otherwise wait for the price drop to make the purchase.+ Graphics and moves are deeply flashy like the anime and felt truly cool to pull off.+ Refined fighting mechanic that is easy to learn includes guard break and counterattack to help balance out the problems but very hard to master using these since they are about timing.+ Includes Japanese language choice+ has a world tournament mode to unlock items in and do special mini games for the collectionist+ Fighting feels a lot more refined and fluid+118 characters and two different support with a great amount of combination to create+ Lots of unlockables, character aesthetic customization and secrets to unlock in the various modes.+ Easy to learn, Fun to play, but hard to master. Not to be taken too seriously+Mecha naruto story mode is different.- No hands on tutorial for new players, but you can read from the menu and learn it since its easy.- Ninja escapades story is short 1 hour and 30 mins, the mecha naruto seems to be longer.- Network play depends on who is hosting, can be laggy at times well, most of the time its a lagfest and really unenjoyable because of this if you are matched with low pinged players OR maybe its the net code not sure but holy lag.- If you get matched up with a pro, you're 90% guaranteed death lol unless you get lucky somehow- For the price of 49.99, you'll have to be die hard, because this one is focused upon the fighting mechanics' online play, unlocks and ninja world mode. There isn't much to story mode this time around.- The epic scores and events aren't in this version (Mecha naruto end battle was the only part)- If you are coming into this game thinking its a serious and very competitive game, then you got it wrong.- The lag is now unbearable online and a real turn off, as if every player is lagging I can turn on injustice or ssf4 fine without atrocious transmission or lag against other players.review ontwitch.tv/kenuty"

The feel to the game is nothing like Storm 3 or 2, if you are used to playing them and think ""Oh its another naruto game, it will be fun and easy since i am so good at this one."" Think again.  There also is no real story to the game wich is really irritating. That is the main thing a hardcore fan of naruto like me wanted to see was the final battle with Obito and Madara (hopefully will be added in future DLC once the anime is finished).  Overal extremely disapointed, but its up to you if ya want to buy this game."

Well... I'm not thrilled about the game itself.I paid about $45 - $50 (pre-order) and when it was released and had it installed on my laptop, I was disappointed by not only the difficulty of the game, but also the near inability to play it on a PC. It became clear to me that this game was meant for platforms and not a PC as the controls were straight from an XBox game pad complete with triggers and bumpers and finding the right keyboard strokes to play the game effectively proved trying and ultimately nonexistent.This should have been re-worked to be of use to those that wanted to play the game on their laptop. I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone other than those wanting the console version.~Jack Harkness~"

All of the spam characters have been nerfed and the game just plays better online altogether. Try and spam awakening, the other guy can spam ultimates or supports. There's a counter for every type of spammer.The ninja world tournament. It's stupid, it uses the over-the-head battle royale thing that was in storm 3, i hated that garbage waste of time. Escapades? Also stupid, just watch the videos on youtube, not worth paying $40-50 for something you can watch for free.There are like 5 new characters, but once again for $50, haha, no. The online lags over 9000, its horrible. If your playing with friends down the stree it works fine. But try playing with someoen in another country i dare you. It's worse than storm 3. In storm 3, the game would freeze with transmitting on your screen. this game chooses to not do that, but just give you input lag instead, which is worse because your online looking like a dumb♥♥♥♥♥who doesnt know what he's doing because your subsitution is a whole second late.I can say, once again the onine is VERY balanced, WAAY better than storm 3, if you can get it to work. I'm already bored of this game. Storm 3 is basically just free battle with more characters. It's storm 3 DLC worth $5. So unless you don't own Storm 3 already, don't buy this garbage.But me being the die hard fan of Naruto that i am, I don't regret buying this game one cent. I kind of got what i expected to, minus the crap online mode. So maybe if your a fan you'll buy the game, but if you didn't care enough to preorder it, than it's probably because you were skeptical. Your skepticism was well placed,as this game is worthless. :)"

This is not a bad game, and I say that with honesty. This game is a testamony to laziness, slacking on the devs side, its not innovative, and worst of all it's a cash grab. I would not pay full price for this game if I were you. If you want this game rent it or whatever, but don't buy it until it goes on steam sell or something.The problem with this game is that it is full burst 3, but with some new characters, and anime cut scenes. There is basically no story in the game, and they try to sell you on this tournament which you will get bored of, and they also try to sell you on this robot naruto. This I guess is one of the selling points, but his story is EXTREMLY unintresitng, and I doubt anyone wanted a game just for a robot naruto anyway.Another problem is this 100+ characters deal. They advertise this game and say we have over 100 playable people, but 6 of those guys are Sasuke, 4 or 5 are Naruto, 2 are the first hokage, 3 or Obito actually 4 is you count him as a child, and the list goes on. I really don't get it because they made 3 different Madaras one character. This is very lazy because I mean over half these characters were in full burst, and they had the exact same moves + special. Also I guess to be fun or balanced you have to choose to be in awaken mode or special mode, and I personally think they should be more of a choice and not either or. I get it is to balance the game, but it is a step back if I am playing as naruto and I can't do my special just because I can awaken or vice versa. I think they could have ismply made more complicated controls because well its a fighting game!If you've played full burst 3 you have basically played this game, and there is your story. There is no ninja time line or anyhting, so save your money. There is no point to this game other then its a new naruto game, and I'm sure next year they will make a new one because the series has not even ended this year. Next year they will probably do it right and give you a story, real full characters, and leave this tournament stuff for an extra mode like free battle or something.There is no story, there are too many copy cat characters, the ninja tournament gets boring FAST, and  mecha naruto is pretty uninteresting as a character and in his story.Final line:Game is full burst 3 50 bucks add-n and out of 10 I'd give this game a 3.5 maybe 4, but 3.5."

I suppose that I bought this game thinking that it would be a lot of added content.. I mean; the world tournament is okay but I really think the Orbs were misplaced. It just feels like maybe it should be decided based on the last man standing rather than the person who holds the most orbs. That would, at least,  take some tactics.I read a review that stated we should at least have been able to make our own Ninja. That would have been neat for the amount of money that this game costs... But you're essentially paying for some DLC in the form of a new game.Playing locally is fun but as I said before thats the only thing to do.

,Recommended,272510,18017921,"Posted: 13 September, 2015",all,Pyracious,"I like this a lot more than Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst. The Story doesn't feel like monotonous rehashed story elements from the manga, and much of the gameplay is in the tournament mode anyways which feels more like an pseudo-open-world environment. You can pretty much explore the tournament-mode map at your own leisure and help out other characters whom will then become available to support you in the battles ahead. You can also do some side missions for more money or explore the map and get items from things like floating balloons or stacks of mushrooms. Travel time is a bit tedious but there are NPCs to fast-travel between locations which helps alleviate it.There are tons of items to collect, both cosmetic and otherwise, and despite some cosmetic items being restricted on whom can wear them, it'd also be pretty silly having things like the Two-Tails Tail on Rock Lee or something so it's not like it doesn't make sense. There are also hundreds of items to customize your online profile that are super collectable.Albeit not a huge amount of new characters from the prior title, there are only so many characters that could be added from the series as after a point you're just creating movesets for characters that had a very small impact on the plotline and some others wouldn't make much sense as they've been dead for so long. Every character that someone would really want to play that I can forsee is included that were known at release. And some that people might want as characters are indirectly available as transformations (the tailed beasts).The gameplay itself is pretty cool too. The tournament-mode capture the most orbs style allows you to give it your all and it's not over until the timer ends, In the multi-round tournaments, you can also come back from a huge loss in the prior round just by playing better on your current round character, which is nice. This is quite unlike prior 4-man gamemodes where if you ran out of health you're out, which is no fun at all. It does reward ranged large-aoe attacks more, but a small price to pay for a more varied and less punishing gamemode. In the case that you want more normal matches where you remove your foes health to win, most of the game outside of the tournaments is like that.The only aspects I'd like more is some other ways to unlock characters than simply stockpiling money, and maybe different outfits for some characters that otherwise have none. A more clear difficulty for each recruitment mission before starting it would also be helpful so you know what to expect to an extent and can prepare accordingly, as some of them can be pretty challenging for a new player.I'd give the game an 9/10 overall. The issues I have with it are trivial and it fulfills my expectations of an anime-based fighting game in almost every way."

This is basically as good as it gets! The combat is very flowing and challenging while at the same time being very flashy and rewarding in how intense the fighting feels (especially in the harder levels). The story-mode in this version isn't much to write home about but the game makes up for that fact with the huge character roster.The game looks good, runs fairly well (your milage may vary but I haven't run into any issues or bugs during my ~30 hours of play) and is very fun to play if you have any love at all for the characters in Naruto.This is a definite buy for Naruto fans but it's hard to recommend it to anything other than fans of the show."

,Recommended,272510,13682687,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,Skywarp,"Nice fighting. I'd say it's even more appealing than Mortal Kombat in terms of visuals. Special attacks and combos are easier to perform which only makes the actual combat more fun: you don't bother with pushing multiple buttons and trying to perform combos and ultimate jutsus, but instead you have time to think when is the best time to perform them. Maybe it's not what hardcore players would like to play, but those who are fans of the anime/manga will definitely like it.Character roster is huge, but with some duplicates (but they differ in costumes and jutsu's they use).Story mode is cool, I cleared ""The Creation of Akatsuki"" and so much liked it (two more campaings left). And more importantly it's canon and you won't see this complete story anywhere else, so I suggest to play it.Online battles are cool, however most opponents are too experienced players and if you're still newbie, you will lose a lot. Always watch out for the ping indicator before starting online battle, if it's red you will most likely have lags.Anyway, 8/10"

I can safely say these games have certainly come a long way since then.Story:The game has its own story that it follows; think filler episodes in the anime. There are two story modes in the game: the Ninja World Tournament's mecha Naruto, and the stories in Ninja Escapades. The cut scenes in Escapes were done in the same style as the show and sheds some light on a few areas not covered in the show or manga. I did find it to be a little too short, only taking a couple hours to get through. Though in the game's defense, there isn't much more new canon left that it could have followed and what there is will likely be for a later game.Sound:Being able to pick between English and Japanese versions for the voiceovers is a great option to have. Everyone has their own preference between the two version of the show. However, the music is probably the area I found myself being the most disappointed in. The soundtrack doesn't offer much in terms of variety; I was often just listening to the same few tracks over and over again. After a few hours of gameplay, I ended up just muting it and playing my own music.Gameplay:What do you think of when you hear Ninja World Tournament? Chances are the last thing that comes to mind will trying to be the one with the most orbs collected when the time runs out. While the four person, free-for-all style battles that take place in this mode can be difficult, I felt they were wasted being only used for nabbing orbs. The combo system is another area that felt lacking. To pull off combos in the game you use the b button and, depending on the combo, tilt the control stick up or down once.Overall, I still found this a fun fighting game with a huge cast of characters to choose from. The different modes found under Free Battle help to add some variety and would certainly be fun to play against friends in. While the music certainly is disappointing, I wouldn't say it ruined the game. I recommend this if you're looking for a fan of Naruto and looking for a good way to kill some time."

Mesmo com novos combos, personagens e modos, que são os pontos positivos, eu acho que falta mais alguma coisa para não deixar o jogo entediante depois de um tempo... Tipo mais modo história assim você não pensa em pausar até saber o que aconteceu e não ficar somente em torneios vagos como se estivesse jogando tetris e parasse depois que perdesse.

I am a very addicted player, and I can have a good control of the battle. But when I tried the online mode, I got my butt kicked, because it was so sluggish that I could not perform a basic combo!)- the orb system is boring and broken. You start playing, it's kinda ok. But when you get to rank S, it is REAL boring to play, because there are no new challenges, and the NPC enemy gang up on you, and all you get to do is to dodge all your way hoping who is attacking you get trapped or step on the traps you lay down.- It is not a real story mode with last boss. Mecha naruto story has it, but anyway, you gotta play the boring orb battles first- the characters characteristics does not match what you have on naruto universe.- if you did not see the entire series, you will have a lot of spoilers. It is not really a bad one to consider, but you will be very disappointed when you begin to know something you are not supposed to.- the drive and awakening battle type feels weaker than the ultimate combo one. I don't know if it is a personal issue, but ultimate jutsu battle type is much more easier to fight than the other types.My final words: If you have played Naruto Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst, you will find out this one is REALLY BORING! Ok, we have new jutsus, a great improvement on avoidability mechanics (RT does the strafing), but no. I thought this was a good game until I played his antecessor full burst.

The only way to actually fight in this fighting game is to do free battles otherwise you are looking at a lot of pointless map roaming and endless ""cut scenes""  And just as with DBZ instead of putting any work into ""bosses"" they just make them immune to stagger from your attacks.

The AI doesn't really seem to display any intelligence with this system and seems to just attack for the sake of attacking rather than going for the opponent with the most orbs but like I said before I've only played at the lower ranks.For fans of the anime nothing here is canon at all. So if you were looking to get this game to conclude the series without the filler this isn't for you and you need to go check out Storm 4. Also there is no real recognition by anyone in relation to what character you use for the tournament. I decided to use Naruto with Kurama's cloak but when I went to speak to Konohamaru, Shizune, Iruka, Hinata, Kiba and Shino they all acted like they were talking to a stranger.

Some of the mechanical changes in the fighting, principally the change to the ""ultimate"" and ""team"" mechancis, take options away while fighting to make for less fun, crazy fights.For someone who does not own either game I suggest NS3:FB over this, however if you have not played either they are both good anime fighting games.Pros:-More Naruto fighting, more characters, new storylines-Interesting team ultimate attacks-Built on same great fighting system as previous game-Interesting four-player mode comparable to a Super Smash Bros coin battleCons:-Removed option of using ultimate attack and awakened state and team attacks in the same battle, requiring a fighter to choose between the three before the round begins, this limits your fighting style to only one of the three and takes away options during the match-Poorly done single player with tedious overworld tasks and storyline consistent with the quality of filler episodes rather than canon storylines"

I find this game funner because each match is more different. It doesn't have nearly as good as a story mode as the game before it but it easily makes up for it in it's new funtion for selecting characters. Instead of choosing the characters you are using for support in a match to be more defense-based, attack-based, or just a mix of the 2; you change how your character fights with either a really strong attack, the ability to do an awakening and a true awakeing(aka going super sayin and super sayin god), and the ability to use your supports more than before. This makes your matches much more different compared to the last game where the only difference is your characters, your enemy's characters, and what their supports are set to.I would recommend this game regardless if your a naruto fan or not, i find it balanced enough to enjoy and think that the larger array of characters that this game offers compared to NS:UNS3 is worth it even if you like NS:UNS3 better.8/10, great to play with friends or to watch and play the small movies in the game.

,Recommended,272510,20793874,"Posted: 27 January, 2016",all,2dumb2die,"i have to say, i enjoy all the naruto storm games i've played and each installment i'd say is better than the last. they put in new charcters so there is that to look forward to as well as new arenas and new things you can make your own character wear so you can be even more unique from otehr people.the game runs super well, and the fights are both fast and fun, and it's a blast to play through. this game, unlike NUNS 3, doesn't really have a story mode, but none of the others before it really copied over the same story repeatedly. you could insert a dragonball Z story from every game that's ever come out. this one does however have a few little side stories such as a new charcter to the universe based around the main mode of the game as well as a few clips followed by fights that give back story to how things came to be.the main mode of this game is a tournament based story.... 'story' ther isn't really much to it other than ""go into a rank of an arena and fight a few fights against 3 other opponents."" it's really more of you fighting 2 computers that are in a battle royal where you try to get teh most orbs, basically your score for endgame, and the one with the most wins. when you finish a rank you can continue the.... 'story' and get to unlock the next rank to fight in. this includes new traps or obsticales to make fighting the computers harder.ther are other modes such as tournaments, leagues, as well as sruvival where you last as long as you can against waves of enemies or until you get beat out in an endless fight. there is also online where you can obviously fight other players and a place to customize your charcters, and each version/costume/whatever can have their own 3 differnt custom looks with items they wear, things they substitue with, or even finishing scenes when you get and ultimate finsh.i can say for certain, after going for every achievement that the tournament stuff, the 'story' mode really isn't that hard. the higher the difficulty the more hazards you need to watch out for, but the more stuff the ai can get tripped up on and lose their orbs for you to just swoop in and steal free points. several times, eve on the challenges i never needed to do more than doge and dash for a whole round since it was easier to let them beat the snot out of one another or just get blasted by traps.that does bring me to what i would say is the last thing i can think of to talk aobut here and that is the ai.when they are on low difficulty, they aren't too resistant or aggressive, but oin higher difficulties they can basically cheat to fight. i want to call it true artificial difficulty because the only reason i seem to have trouble with fighting computer opponents and the like in survivalk where you need to win and beat all oponenets to win is because they can do things in split seconds that take you longer to do. some of the problems being, instant chakra dashes, so they can cancel your dash without you having seen them load chakra or things like, when you subtstitute and get behind them they can instantaniously dash into you and continue their combo. they can literally do this and sub from your attacks and still be at an advantage because they can do things that aren't physically possible.really, it's an amazingly fun game, and even better with friends, and it's awesome to see what you can do to make more unique combos using dashes, cancels, justsu and the like. and even though it's fun even fighting ai, they can be really cheap and unfair only because it makes it harder for you to win. but it's not really a fair and realistic chalenge where you feel great having won because you can't really get an opening out of them.last thing too, forgot to say so. if you are trying to grind out the achievements liek i did, i will say taht it is TEDIOUS! i swear most of the time i took longer to go from fight to fight than it did for me to actually beat it and go on to the next one. just be warned, if you have any desire to power through and get things in this game, you'll most likely spend more of your time sighing because you just want to be done with somethign that takes 3 times as long as it should to complete."

However there is one thing I noticed about the storm games. The first one for ps3 was simply amazing.  But as the games were released i couldnt help but to notice they removed features, for ex the first Storm had wall running, jutsu clashing, ultimate jutsus that looked awesome and you could defend against along with breaking out of if you pressed more buttons than the other player. The old ones had those features. Don't get me wrong I still enjoy the ultimate jutsus but I feel like they toned down the over-the-topness of them. In number 2 is when the made adjustments which I didn't like 2 as much but it eventually grew on me.  This one introduces a new tournament mode which is only single player for some reason. I was hoping they were going for the more Clash of Ninja approach. For those looking for a story, either go with 3 full burst or wait for storm 4 which I atleast hope the bring bacl clashing. but I do recommend this is you looking for a butt-ton of characters."

The multiple-charachter fights are annoying in the least, and I don't think the AI is very good at it. When it comes to one-on-one fighting, with or without support charachters it typically comes down to who can chakra rush successfully first, then you have the substitution advantage, and chakra rush is basicly a stun lock, then you can be combo'd and stun rushed again, unless you use your substitution jutsu, or are good with your support charachters. Of course you can try to block the stun, but that bounces them back, just far enough for them to charge for another rush, or block your rush. You can grab, too if you can pull it off, your special abilities usefullness depends on your charachter.That's just the tip of the iceberg though, unlike other games you have to choose between taking an ultimate ability or a transformation. The campaign is just constant Arena fights and occasional fetch/fight quests. on one island. The Arena is primaily the annoying multi-person fights.Overview: Spam your charged rush/melee combo/substitution unless you are deidara or tenten, point based 4-way fights are a good concept, but the targeting controls and camera make them an annoyance in a ""Campaign"" where they are practicly all that happens.

It felt much like I was getting just the combat that was in ultimate ninja storm 3 but with a few weeks worth of work making it look like a new game.   it is way too much reliant on the combat for sustenance.  Anything outside of combat is just a bare, shallow way to get you to the next fight.Also combat poses no real challenge is 99% of the battles.  Either the ai blows or the user is too strong.  I think its a little bit of both.  The only enemies that could be difficult are those who are range heavy.  Also awakening for some characters is op which i think is why the drive mode was added.  Drive mode however is still not enough with the ai behind it.My favorite Naruto game is by far Rise of a Ninja.  In that game combat was fun and outside of combat actually felt like it had a point to it.  There were fun missions (unlike the side missions in revolution), hidden items, and a cast of characters that were a joy to interact with.  I know that this is shippudden and things are much more serious than in rise of a ninja, but at the same time it lacks the fun, adventurous feel that made the game a joy to play.I would recommend this game if not only to support the presence of naruto games on steam.  The game is far from perfect, but still offers a enjoyable experience with a lower price tag."

There are so many characters in this game, and it's really fun to run around as your favorite characters, fight as them with their special techniques and ""decorate"" them with accessories that are references to stuff in the show.  There are also parts of the game that have cool storylines (there are small tidbits in the Tournament, as well as longer ones in the Scenarios mode).Even if you're not a fan of the show, the gameplay is really great.  I haven't played many other fighting games so I can't compare it to anything, but there are so many different mechanics and it doesn't feel like you're just button-mashing to win.  I really like the one-on-one battles the best, but the four player battles are similar to coin mode in smash bros and are also pretty fun.One thing that I thought the game could've done better is the tutorial.  I basically learned how to do everything from reading the tips during the loading screens.  There were so many huge things I missed because they were glossed over: chakra dash (Y+A), the substitution jutsu (RB), even that you can recharge your chakra (hold down Y).  Also, if you pick a ranged character, make sure you hit X as your primary button or you'll be wondering why your ranged character has no ranged moves.  I didn't figure out any of these things until the B-rank of the tournament... yeah....Once you figure out all of the controls and possible moves though, this game is great fun even in offline.  I haven't played online yet but I'm planning to try it (and probably get destroyed)."

I must say I am IMMENSELY UNSATISFIED with this product.The best thing about N:UNS2 was the fact that you can go through the Naruto story and relive all the fights, the boss encouters in that game were a lot of fun.This game has NO story mode at all, the main mode is a sort of World Tournament mode that takes place outside of any sort of Chronological history of Naruto itself. The fact that this mode is the main mode of the game is stupid beyond words. Every. Single. Main fight that you do is a 4 way free for all match, with horrible at AI that seemingly only targets you, there isn't really a strategy to it all, you can't play defensively you can only hope that after you are done being combo'd by everyone that you can escape and knock someone around for orbs and hope you have the most by the end of the timer.like really?

,Recommended,272510,30179159,Posted: 25 February,all,spiralstorm97248,"** ATTENTION ALL NARUTO FANS AND PLAYERS ALIKE **This review may contain spoilers and comparison information regarding other similar games to this one. Read at your own discretion...Now, under normal circumstances, I don't review single-player games unless...1: They are absolutely awesome or terrible (Glitches notwithstanding) or...2: I can compare them to an identical or similar multiplayer game I have played or also actively play. This being said, NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM Revolution will be compared and contrasted from/to...1: NARUTO Online. 2: NARUTO Saga/NARUTO Spirit. So here goes...NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM Revolution quite possibly has the best graphics and most playable characters out of any NARUTO game I've ever played. It is also VERY IMPORTANT for one to remember this is a FIGHTING GAME, so exploration of many areas is going to be quite limited, unlike in the game NARUTO Online, where there are several notable areas of the shinobi world one can freely explore in spite of the simpler (But well-done) graphics. Nevertheless, you are able to run around and even jump up to/down from higher or lower places at your leisure. The fighting here is also going to be fast-paced; be aware of this and be prepared to change your battle tactics (And perhaps your control configurations) in order to suit your foes' weaknesses. Unlockable characters include...1: At least a few of the Kage. 2: Several variations of Naruto and other notable ninja, including most members of the Akatsuki, and even Madara Uchiha! There are also a few different modes, including the notable Ninja Escapades, which play out much like a typical NARUTO Arc. The downside of this (And every game has a downside) is the inability to explore different areas during the Escapades. In fact, the last Escapade is only a cut-scene with no player interaction whatsoever. The mode which actually DOES allow for some exploration is the Mecha-Naruto Story, which isn't as fun, because of the inability to select your characters as you see fit. And speaking of which...You cannot create your own characters either; you have to make use of the ones provided and unlock additional characters as you progress through the game. Kind of disappointing, but again, similar to NARUTO Online. On there, you CAN sort-of create your own character and shape him or her pretty-much to your liking. One can do the same with NARUTO Saga/NARUTO Spirit, however, I would NOT recommend playing NARUTO Saga/NARUTO Spirit AT ALL!! The story and graphics on there are VERY POORLY DONE; you have to shell out real money to gain access to Naruto himself; the Hidden Leaf Village looks NOTHING like it should; and, to top it all off, the Ninja you DO gain access to are nothing but enemies to Team 7!! Why would anyone want Mizuki on their team!? Come on!! Anyway, I would recommend NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM Revolution for the Ninja Escapades, if nothing else. Otherwise, good luck unlocking all those talented ninja. You'll need it! ;-)"

Its more important to time your attacks, counters and defense to chip on the enemy health.Overall I recommend it if you hadnt got the previous instalations as it is a fun game, however it will take a while to unlock all the characters."

I got it more because I liked Naruto than because I particularly love fighting games, but I find the game mechanics engaging and fun. It seems to me that, with the recharge mechanics for various actions, combat has a light tactical feel. For me, this is a plus; I don't especially enjoy games that value twitch reflexes over all else. (...My favorite games ever were Medieval Totar War and Heroes 3).I find the game very nice looking, the colors and designs more vibrant and interesting than in the anime itself. In ~13 hours I've had two crashes, both in a row, and no other stability problems. In a few cut scenes I've noticed visual stutters, but that's about it for technical complaints.I do have two larger gripes:(1) The variety of characters is undercut by the fact that some of them are very similar. E.g. There are at least four different narutos -- not Naruto costumes, but Naruto characters, and I think a comparable number of Gaaras. It's really not that I find the variety of characters bad, just that the claim to 100 playable characters doesn't mean as much as it might seem. That said, I do enjoy that it's not super complicated unlocking new characters; you can get most by playing any mode.(2) I wish there were a tutorial and/or a more detailed game manual. There are some modes/mechanics that I still haven't managed to figure out by playing, and I wish there were a text searchable pdf where I could read about them."
