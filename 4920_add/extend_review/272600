,Recommended,272600,18776789,"Posted: 30 October, 2015",all,Lin,"A really fun and endearing little point & click that stands out for its narrative qualities. Unfortunately it is also very streamlined and easy, at least for anyone who has played the first game in the series and expects a bit of a sleuthing challenge.Some history...Detective Grimoire's first appearance was several years back in a free browser game that you should go and playright nowif you haven't already. As a browser game it was unique, interesting, well made (for a free game) and its best selling point was that you were actually required to do some detective work: The game expected you to collect clues, solve puzzles, interrogate people with a fun little lie detecting mechanic, and actually stop, think and make some deductions on your own before you could accuse someone of the crime. It was perfectly possible to make mistakes if you didn't think things through and that was exactly what made the game really interesting....and some crushed expectations.This is sadly not the case with its crowdfunded follow-up. You are asked to sit back and enjoy an easy ride, in which yes, you are interacting with the world and the story in interesting ways, but, no, you are not asked to do any real thinking of your own. And then when you have collected all the strands and are hyped about thinking through the mystery, the game will step in and hold your hand while it reveals its secrets. To me (with my previous high expectations) it felt dumbed down, and that was a disappointment.The Good: Writing, Art, Animation, SoundtrackThat said, this is a really really good, if short, point & click. It is less the answer to the mystery at its core that makes it interesting and more the charming, intriguing characters whose motivations and backstories you're watching untangle. I have a special soft spot for well written dialogue and Detective Grimoire delivers that in spades, accompanied by fantastic voice acting that makes the characters come alive. Bonus points for a dialogue system that expects you to pay attention when interviewing suspects, allowing you to become even more immersed in the game world. In fact not only the characters but the whole ""Boggy's Bog"" you are walking around in feels alive, thanks to some adorable art and an atmospheric soundtrack. I thoroughly enjoyed the lovingly hand-painted backdrops and all the neat animation details.The Mediocre: Gameplay, PuzzlesMy own expectations aside, the gameplay is not bad per se. The fact that it is so streamlined may make the game feel too easy (for me), but one could claim that it also helps in allowing you to become engrossed in the game's story. Still, the puzzles are simplistic and many gameplay elements feel like a missed opportunity. For example, having a suspect screen where you can look through various facts that you have uncovered and tag them as suspicious or not suspicious but then never being allowed to use this mechanic in any meaningful way felt like a real let down. On the other hand, combining your clues into logical claims in order to open up new interrogation opportunities is a much better utilised mechanic, and thus becomes one of the most entertaining gameplay elements. All in all, there are many original ideas here, most of which were sadly not allowed to shine. So come to it expecting to interact with an interesting little mystery, but not to be a real agent of change in this world.The endorsementSo there you have it. I was disappointed by this game, and yet I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is no denying its charm. It is a polished and very entertaining experience but it is also less than 3 hours long with no replayability, so gauge your preferred price tag accordingly. I experienced no technical problems, those elsewhere cited bugs seem to have been patched out. And for any achievement hunters amongst you, it is a really easy game to 100%. It gets a full thumbs up from me, it's a good little game despite its flaws and I have not regretted my purchase. But whatever you do, definitely do yourself a favour and go play it's free predecessor."

And very good voice acting definitely adds to enjoyment!Gameplay isn’t one bit challenging, but finding pieces of evidence, questioning suspects and piecing together what has happened is still fun if you are looking for a more relaxing gameplay. Puzzles could use more complexity, though, even for a casual game.If you are looking for a short casual game to pass a few hours with, Detective Grimoire has my full recommendation!"

When I started to play it, one of the characters at the beginning of the game asked if I remember them, I had to search if this game has a first part, and it turned out there was a previous game which have a separate story and it is not on steam since it was a flash game you canfind here(It doesn't matter if you play that game first or this one)The game is short, has some nice variety of likable characters, I didn't dislike anyone to be honest. I liked the art style and the way you search for evidences, interrogate the suspects characters and the notes taken. It is fully well voiced and the puzzles were nice and simple.Pros:+Great art.+Good story.+Amazing music.+Fast travel map.+Mystery/detective style.+Good voice acting.+Steam achievements.Cons:-Short game.I wished it had multiple endings, it would have been more fun. I recommend this game to everyone who love point & click games, detective, or adventure lovers!

,Recommended,272600,32994709,Posted: 29 June,all,jbondguy007,"Quick introductionSkip to ""Review"" for the game reviewTo begin with, I'd like to mention that SFB Games have been part of my life years before I even knew what Steam was. It all happened the day I discovered the original free flash version of ""Detective Grimoire"" - a wonderful, beautiful, dark, moody and entertaining murder mystery solving game. It was good then, and it still is one of my all times favorite flash games. If you haven't played it yet, I highly recommend to - the newer game even references to the older game a couple of times.After playing the original Detective Grimoire, I - as did many others, I'm sure - sought to find more great games by SFB Games. I was not disappointed to find other great games such as the ""Blue Rabbit"" games series (Climate Chaos was absolutely stunning, at the time anyway), and ""Haunt the House"" (which got a sequel on Steam as well, but that's for another review).With that said, you can guess I was pretty hyped to try the brand new, shiny Detective Grimoire. When I saw it was 80% off for the Steam summer sale (2017, for future reference), I immediately bought and played it.ReviewSo, what is Detective Grimoire? It's a ""lightweight"" and beautifully created detective game where you attempt to solve a murder under strange circumstances - a theme park in the middle of a swamp, themed around the sighting of a strange creature 60 years ago - which happens to be your primary suspect.As you can tell by this short paragraph, the game is not extremely serious, and surely less so than the original Grimoire. The setting is much less dreary than the original, which is not exactly a bad thing. The characters are very memorable and likable, the voice acting and music is absolutely amazing. The game features many innovative ideas, such as combining clues with pieces of sentences to create a thought and progress through the game.Now, while I did enjoy the game, two things annoyed me. First, the game is extremely short, which isn't the main problem - some games are better short. The second and biggest issue was, without a doubt, the confusing choice of audience the developers were going for. Allow me to explain my thoughts...This is a murder mystery game, featuring a creepy swamp and a scary monster as the prime suspect. While this may depend on the parent (or the child, who knows), one could debate that this would hardly be considered a kids game. But then again, the puzzles were hardly puzzles - more like ideas that mostly focused on the game engine's abilities (lots of 2D physics involved there) but not much thoughts put into making it any challenging. Some of the puzzles didn't even make much sense at all (the chemistry set one, for those who played the game - you'll know what I'm talking about) and could have been skipped entirely, at this point. Most puzzles were great ideas, but so poorly implemented that it was more like an attempt at slowing down the player's progress by a moment than anything else. No puzzle took me more than seconds to crack, and I'll be very honest - I generally suck at solving simple puzzles. So the question is, were the puzzle (and the game in general) designed to be easy on purpose?Another thing that was a bit irritating was the slightly annoying ""move"" implementation. When playing games like these, you need to move from one screen to another while looking for hints. The fact that you must select the move option to get anywhere, and at every new screen you need to select the option to move again, made me just use the map move feature more than anything else. And this caused problems, because I only found one of the characters wayyy too late into the game. Sure, I'm partially to blame, but honestly, I just really didn't like the way moving from one location to the other is designed - I think it's just personal preferences, though.That aside, I have to admit I did enjoy the game. As I mentioned before, the characters design, voicing and animations make the game a very pleasant experience.What could have been done better? Well, obviously the puzzles should be more challenging, the game should be longer, and the mystery a bit more ""mysterious"" rather than pretty obvious. The idea to combine hints was neat, but I would have loved to see it used a bit more often, with more ""freedom"" for lack of better words. The ability to take pretty much anything anyone said and combine it with any evidence or hints would have been extremely interesting, although I admit it would have its downside as well.Overall, I feel that the ""new"" Grimoire series is off to a good start, although I'd like to see a bit more of the old game in the new one. As for the pricing, I think it is slightly steep for such a short game. I finished it within roughly 2-3 hours, and would have been pretty disappointed if I hadn't bought it during a sale. But honestly, this is one of these opinions that change from person to person, or, more likely, wallet to wallet. Heh.Well, that was longer than expected.Thanks for reading, if you managed to get all the way down here."

,Not Recommended,272600,23311336,"Posted: 31 May, 2016",all,stardustsunday,"More for kids.This is a point-n-click adventure game where you, as Detective Grimoire, are tasked with solving the murder of a proprietor of a tourist attraction that's located in a swamp. The game has nice graphics and is well-made on the whole, but I just found it way too simple, the story so-so, and the interface and gameplay aimed too much at children.I would only recommend this to kids/teens aged 7-15.Here's what I liked:+ Mystery to be solved+ Pretty, vibrant visuals+ Fully voiced+ Voice autoplays during conversations, so you can just sit back and let things flow+ Good music+ High production values+ Quite a few trading cardsHere's what I didn't:- Puzzles are way too simple- Some puzzles are poorly conceived and have nothing to do with the context- Mainly just talking to other characters- No object use (i.e. you never have an inventory and never need to use any item)- Not a ""real"" adventure game per se (due to the points mentioned above)- Almost all the clues are pieced together by combining words to form a sentence- Very kiddish interface- Story is dull, uninspired, unoriginal and bland- Conclusion is really boring and anti-climactic- No satisfaction in solving the mystery- Game holds your hand throughout and treats you like you're 5 years oldSome examples of the ""puzzles"" you will encounter:1) Moving objects aside to find what was beneath them. And you arespecifically instructedto do so. DUH.2) Selecting the correct phrases to form a sentence. E.g. ""___ was told to ___ yesterday."" And the choices you are given are dead obvious.3) Putting the correct pairs together.4) Entering the correct code to open a lock, and the code hasnothingto do with the lock.5) Choosing the correct image to form a clue. E.g. On a diagram of a person hiding in a tent, you must choose a picture (out of 4 choices) that depicts what made him stay in the tent. All the choices other than the correct answer are completely nonsensical.6) Putting gears in the correct place to open something.7) Choosing the correct string in a tangle.8) Matching the correct shape to the keyhole.ConclusionIt's not a bad game, but it's definitely not for the discerning old-school adventure gamer looking for at least some creative & challenging adventure game puzzles to solve. Add to that a reallyblahstory with no drama or excitement whatsoever, and I say give this a miss."
,Recommended,272600,11852579,"Posted: 24 August, 2014",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"Let's get one thing out of the way first: Detective Grimoire is not the bonafide Professor Layton clone some may have been hoping for. Though it shares a few similarities, and even references the top hat wearing puzzle solver at one point, where Layton focuses heavily on brain teasers and riddles Grimoire is a pure detective game; something akin to an elaborate game of Clue crossed with an adventure game. While I could see developer SFB Games losing some people at this point, Detective Grimoire is actually all the better off for straying away from Nintendo's franchise and carving its own original, highly enjoyable path for itself.Set in a swamp located in the middle of nowhere, populated by suspicious individuals, and potentially home to a mysterious and brutal creature, a murder takes place. With little to go on, the police turn to Detective Grimoire (whose first name I never did find out), who arrives at the scene of the crime and begins to get to work putting the pieces together of just what occurred the night before.And this is where you come in. When I said this was a pure detective game, I meant it quite fully, as the entire game is broken down to finding clues, questioning suspects, and gathering evidence to eventually track down the culprit. As a result, the actual gameplay is rather simple, and usually involves little more than asking suspect A about clue B to get clue C, and repeat this until you've exhausted what you can get out of who you're questioning.It's a bit dull on paper, yes, but what kept me engaged throughout the 3 or so hour story was the brilliant writing, lively character, and dry humor and wit of Grimoire. There is a huge amount of personality in every character, every line of dialog delivered with some truly fantastic voice work leading you one step closer to the final reveal, and the vibrant and wonderfully animated art is just the character on top. The plot itself likely couldn't hold its own among most other whodunits, but the way everything is presented more than makes up for the occasionally straightforward narrative and kept me entertained and guessing right up to the very end.Perhaps some will miss the puzzles or elaborate plot of other detective games, but I for one found Detective Grimoire's offbeat style, basic but enjoyable sleuthing, and buckets of personality one of the more uniquely enjoyable games I've played all year. It doesn't try to do a whole lot, but focuses its energy where it counts and makes my only real disappointment being there is not more of it. Thankfully, if what is hinted at after the credits becomes a reality we'll be seeing more of this detective soon, and that's definitely something to look forward to.You can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

I like their smell, I like how they look, and I even enjoy eating the first few french fries. However after eating first few fries, they sit like an iron weight in my stomach and I start feeling sick. Then I remember ""Oh yes. This is why I shouldn't buy french fries. I should remember never to buy them again."" I buy a lot of french fries.I also enjoy the anticipation of adventure games. The videos tease an interesting plot, cool artwork, funny dialogue, or a tantalizing mystery and I can't resist. However, after playing one for a few minutes, I remember why I hate them. Most of the gameplay consists of searching for something to click on, watching unskippable cutscenes, or waiting for characters to walk... and I remind myself never to buy one again. I buy a lot of adventure games....and this is the first one I've enjoyed playing. The high points for me are what's not there:- You will never need to watch a character walk.- All the cutscenes are skippable and most are repeatable if you miss something.- Movement is instant. Click on the map location you want and your character is instantly there.All the puzzles are trivially easy, and the gameplay itself mainly consists of dialog trees. You click on all the dialog options in order while the game tells you its story. This is a good thing, though. A game like this is all about the story, and difficult puzzles just interrupt the storytelling.If you'd just like to be told a story and you hate the gameplay in traditional point-and-click adventures, this is the adventure game for you.Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here"

It is short, I completed the game with most achievements in under 4 hours. The story is enjoyable and the characters are memorable and well written. The puzzles are not really challenging for anyone with even a little experience of this kind of game in the past but again serve there purpose and are fun to varying degrees. The game shows its ""android"" routes at various stages (like the puzzles that require moving things), which is a negative for me but they do not detract enough from the overall experience to warrant a negative review.If you are looking for a simple, short blast of fun that can be played and enjoyed by all ages then I highly recommend this game.If you are looking for an in-depth adventure with challenging puzzles that require walkthroughs and/or immense intelligence try something else.As it stands I would purchase a part 2 without hesitation and the story lends itself to that possibility.10/10 would get a ""boggy"" foot fetish again."

Simplistic vector art with an equally simplistic sound track but its hoisted up by the intricate details that goes into the mechanics of the game itself.My favorite part of the game was the ability to teleport to places you have visited already.Seems small but alot of the point and click games that i have encountered on steam would have you clicking through every screen until a mystical portal appears from your sequence of clicks. -.-I dont want to ruin anything...so i shall shush.But its a game everyone should play..atleast once.

You manipulate pieces of locks in order to open them. You have to talk to multiple people in order to open new dialogue options with other people. It's a murder mystery involving an amusement park in a swamp!But it wasn't challenging at all. I'm not saying that in a I'm-smarter-than-you-and-all-other-gamers way. I mean that the puzzles seem like they were made for kids: you match shapes of objects with shapes of holes; you mix blue and yellow liquid to get green liquid; all important words are in a different color font. I loved the animation style and Detective Grimoire, so I'd be willing to give a sequel another shot; but I can't recommend this game to adults.

That's not to say that adults can't enjoy it, but you should know going in that may be purchasing something that was meant more for pre-teens and younger.

It was more interesting than I originally assumed it would be, considering the price (well, I got it on sale...). As negative traits, I must say it's quite short (you can finish it in three hours or less, finding every clue and getting every achievement) and the puzzles are ridiculously simple. I would even think it's cool for children (well, yeah, there's a murder, but you don't even see the corpse or even blood, but I don't mean 3 y/o kids... well I don't know).Things I liked about this game:*Artwork. I liked the cartoonish style. It was simple and nice. It conveyed very basic body language (well, facial actually) in a humorous way. The atmosphere is very well achieved.*Dialogs. The scripts were rather humorous, dynamic and very well acted. I liked the different choices in dialog, even though they don't always affect the outcome of the interrogation (but sometimes they do). Little objection:it can become incredibly annoying to click ""not suspicious"" on all the clues of one character, because the guy keeps saying it over and over, but I guess it doesn't matter if you don't do them all at the same time.*Sounds. The environmental sounds were great, not too overwhelming that they became annoying. The music was one of the best I heard in this kind of games. It reminded me strongly to the style of Danny Elfman music, and it was a perfect fit for the atmosphere of this game.I can recommend this cute little game, especially if on sale, as a lovely way of spending a couple of hours.

It's just a talking game in which you can't really do anything but talk about the handful of topics that out there with each of the eight or nine characters and eventually, when you have asked everyone about everything the games reaches to its conclusion.Don't let me wrong, I don't mind it to be easy.

Although it draws from other classic games in its style (particularly the Ace Attorney series, to the point where certain plot elements are a little too similar), this is not a game that presents the familiar challenge you'd expect from the games it brings to mind.  There doesn't seem to be any penalty for mistakes, and the puzzles, although cute and lovingly designed, won't stay on your screen for more than a minute.I was disappointed by the short length; I had expected this to be the first 'case' of the game, but in fact it was the whole game.  It ought really to have a sub-title in its official name as apparently further games in the series are planned.  The price is a bit high considering its brevity, but you can certainly do a lot worse with your money.It might all sound rather negative so far, but I am happy to recommend this game to anyone who is not bothered by a lack of difficulty or relatively short play time.  The characters are wonderful, the voice acting is great fun (though one character is disconcertingly sexy; I think her voice might haunt me for a while).

The game has a few minor gameplay issues, but nothing that took away the entertainment and feeling of immersion in play. It offers a rather detailed interface that can be intimidating at first, but each tool is important to your ability to solve the crime. I go into detail about the interface features more in my video review.This is a traditional point and click detective adventure that I am pleased to report focuses more on the investigative and detective aspects of the game rather than flooding you with puzzles that can take away from your immersion into your case. The items you acquire are clues that tie together to help you figure out who the murderer is. You aren't running around the map on a wild scavenger quest.  This game is one of the few that actually does the 'detective' aspect right. It isn't too complicated, and fairly straightforward, but it synergizes with itself well.It does have some comedic elements, but nothing that will have you rolling in the aisles. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it does so just enough to relay the gravity of solving a murder.  At the end of the day, this was a very enjoyable game. It has a solid story and solid gameplay, with a well put together detective interface and mechanics. There are a few minor performance issues, but nothing that would ruin your experience.

As Detective Grimoire, you must gather evidence to discover how and why the murder was committed, and then interrogate people to learn facts about them, which will help you to work out which one is the murderer.The game is simple to pick up, and fun to play. In particular I enjoyed the ""challenge"" mechanic, which allows you to quiz each suspect on a key topic and use evidence to get the truth out of them. This mechanic was reminiscent of the Phoenix Wright games for Nintendo DS. The puzzles were very simple, but in a way it was nice to play the game and enjoy the story without getting stuck on complicated puzzles.The story was fun, and the characters were entertaining and well-acted. My only criticism is that it is a very short game (about 2 hours long), which would be fine as the first episode in a multi-part series, but as a standalone game it does leave you feeling unsatisfied. The game could easily be extended to include more than one case, and hopefully the developers will do so in the future.The graphics in my opinion were fine, a very simple 2D cartoony style, but I imagine that some people would find the style very ugly and it would put them off the game. I would encourage them to look past the graphics and try to enjoy the game for the story and gameplay. One thing I did notice about the graphics is everything was very large, as if it was a mobile phone game stretched to fill a full-sized screen.  But this didn't interfere with enjoyment of the game in any way.Overall, I would heartily recommend this game if it is on sale. But due to its unsatisfactory length, I would not recommend paying full price.  I would say the game is suitable for ages 8 and up (despite the murder theme, there is no violence or gore)."

Beat.The detective (Grimoire) keeps ample notes on objects, places, and items (with only the occasional misspelling), so that you do not spend time trying to find out about something you already know.  Characters also (helpfully!) remember what you have asked them about -- greying out those choices so you do not find yourself repeating the same questions over and over.

(Oh, I already miss the fun and adventure.)The smart gameplay with tons of humor, leading-edge puzzles, gut-busting kind of narration with nifty voicing quality makes this game super-awesome (two thumbs up here!!!). All the characters are so adorable and the soundtracks are perfect especially for those lovers of mystification (whooaah!).What I love the most about this game is that you’re playing as a detective (Detective Grimoire) who’s very keen in solving a murder case by a weird green creature (Boggy). The characters are like those in cartoon network due to its flamboyant style, environment, art, and graphics. Excellent interface! The puzzles are not that staggering and can be unlocked through common sense and comprehension as the game is progressing.I would say that you should try this flashy game! As you meet various characters through playing the conundrum, clues and evidences will also be unveiled which will bring you up together the pieces and linking it with all that you’ve discovered to formulate judgment or conclusion. Sounds interesting, right? (Hehe!)The only thing that I felt disappointed about is that the game was too short. I was expecting of a more story rich game especially with its great quality (waaaahh).Overall, beautifully presented! I would surely RECOMMEND this game. It’s worth the play!

The story, setting and characters are charming, but that's not really what shines the most - the best part is the interface. Considering this was designed for touchscreens (and arguably for a casual audience), the interface is uncompromisingly designed to facilitate considering every little aspect of the mystery, and to minimise hand-holding.The only legitimate complaint I can make about this game is that there's one or two bugs with information showing up in the Clues log earlier than it should, and one case where the log tells you something that you can never find out in conversation - probably an error, with the detail being revealed in a branch of conversation that was re-written shortly before release.In the first paragraph, I said that the best thing about the game was the interface, but to be honest... it's the subtlety. If you're paying attention, rather more is going on here than the game will directly address. I hope you like that Twin Peaks ""wait... didnt' we miss something important here?"" feeling. I do."

Combined with a unique graphical style and good music, the game deserves a rousing two-thumbs-up.I will note, though, that the actual gameplay components are very simple and even the most complex brainteaser in the game will prove very little of a threat to anyone with a fully functional brain.

It has a decent story with interesting characters and funny dialogue. It's not exactly the best, but it's not horrible. The gameplay is a homage to titles like Phoenix Wright and Professor Layton (albeit with a LOT less puzzles and more just questioning the characters about literally everything).The music is amazing, and the background art is gorgeous. It was refreshing to have a point-and-click that was not only visually pleasing, but also atmospheric, upbeat, and pleasant to he ears despite the fact that you're solving a murder.However, that's not to say that this is the perfect casual mystery. The game is silly sometimes and it's not very challenging (probably because I feel like this was partially meant to market towards kids). I mean, you're in a swamp trying to solve the murder of the owner of a tourist attraction and you don't even know if the murderer even exists. Hell it wouldn't take anyone long to 100% this game because it's so simple. There's no replay value.But if you're looking for a short and decent casual point-and-click with witty dialogue then give this a go. It's worth the money."

My only problem with it was the length: the exploration chapters ended pretty abruptly and then after one last conversation the game ended. The fact that there were so many features made me think there would be more cases that make real use of them. For example, the game keeps memorable quotes from the characters and lets you decide whether or not you want to mark them as 'Suspicious', even providing an achievement for getting it right. However, the second you meet the culprit it's 100% obvious that it's them, so there's no real reason to juggle suspects at all. A lot of the evidence was red herrings, but in a way that looks like there was some plot that was scrapped (there's a theme of which flowers are found in which areas that seems to lead nowhere despite multiple pieces of evidence). It would be a real shame if this game weren't continued or if the engine weren't applied to a case that needs it."

This is like a short demonstration of the game mechanism and style for a detective themed click-and-point adventure, in lieu of building the ""full adventure"". In terms of these features, it could be compared to LA Noire, but Discworld Noir still had more innovation, such as combining clues and notes and objects to make deductions. Detective Grimoire could be said to build on this, but in a very limited way, by the use of a selection of combining phrases to choose from in order to craft a deduction. But, as I said, this was specialized/tailored to each specific situation rather than a generalised mechanism (plus a limited selection of topics rather than all the available clues/notes, although that limitation does make it more streamlined). So, there is room for improvement maybe."

You are a detective trying to solve a murder. Along the way you meet characters and clues to help solve this case.The voice acting and general art direction is spot-on. It's light and never too serious, but even as an adult (29 years-old), I was never put off. Probably because it doesn't treat you like kids that much.

Steam reports that I got about 3 hours of entertainment from it.As far as challenges go, it's pretty straightforward and mostly relies on discovering clues and suspects, and then interviewing suspects about those clues (and about other suspects).  For that, you're really just along for the ride as you learn more and more of the story.Additionally, there's a clever little game mechanic that involves you choosing the correct clues/suspects and fractures of a sentence to form a conclusion that uncovers various truths.  That part emulates thinking through what you've discovered like a detective might, and feels pretty rewarding when you get it right.Beyond that, there are a few minigame-puzzles to complete to allow you to progress to certain areas.  They're cute and fun, but really only a momentary distraction.Overall, this won't be a title that appears to many hardcore gamers.  But the art style, storyline & mystery, and deductive reasoning puzzles will be appealing to a certain audience.

The characters all have their own characteristics, reflective of various kinds of people in society, and (SPOILER ALERT) I like how the murder case unveils another even bigger and more grave secret within. In my opinion, such a story does not fall short of a Sherlock Holmes story.Sweet refers to the game design in terms of mechanics, graphics and music. Looking for clues, interrogating suspects and deduction are necessary in solving a case mystery, and absolutely well put in this game. The most interesting mechanic for me is the part where you have to drag in suitable subjects from a list of subjects and cycle through a list of predicates to complete your thoughts and proceed from there. The graphics are kid-friendly but still does not lose the mysterious atmosphere in the game, while the music only serves to complement the stated aspects of the game.And I sure hope the little girl becomes the detective's right-hand partner in the sequel!"

The gameplay area consists of less than twenty different locations around the bayou, but is stuffed full of memorable characters to converse with and lots of clues to discover.Detective Grimoire has obviously been designed for tablets, but the game transcends its origins simply by not dumbing down stuff needlessly. Sure, the game is not terribly hard since its designed for people of all ages to enjoy, but you do need to use your brain to actually make conclusions based on the evidence you're presented with. For the most part, it feels like you're doing real detective work instead of just solving random puzzles.Production values are high as well, with fitting music, good writing, marvelous voicework and a rather unique, painterly graphics style that reminds me a bit of Day of the Tentacle. Overall, everything fits together really well, and it's maybe even a bit hard to fully appreciate the game because of how completely slick it is.

The story is about a detective named Grimoire who was called to investigate the murder of man who was the owner of small tourist attraction in the middle of a swamp, where the main suspect is the strange creature that hasn't been seen for 60 years which is what the tourist attraction is based off of.Gameplay has you exploring the tourist attraction, collecting clues, interrogating suspects and solving various puzzles. Most of which is quite fun and enjoyable, each puzzle feels very awarding to solve although they aren't all that difficult, finding a new clue and interrogating suspects feels very exciting, however exploring the tourist attraction is a bit tedious since there are many locations and most of them are very bland and boring.I would say that there isn't really to much of a mystery in this game, it's a fairly simple concept and not all that serious and exciting, which is OK, there's nothing wrong with having something just be simple, but don't expect anything amazing with this. In fact I would say that most of the elements of the game are fairly lacking and nothing really stands out, it's all good but nothing worth praising for.To summarize Detective Grimoire is a fun game that will keep you entertained for a couple hours which I would recommend, but really isn't what you call a ""must play."""

However I would still reccomend it, because despite the fact it's short and easy (and overpriced), it's stilll good. The sluthing you'll have to do to figure out the case isn't hard, it only took till I was half-way through the game to figure it out, and that was only because I didn't realize I forgot to talk to one of the suspects. Even if you couldn't piece it together based of the first few clues, the game makes sure you have more than enough evidence to convict the killer by the end of the game. Each character you meet also has a challenge topic for you to beat. Most of them aren't hard, once again I only got stuck when  I actually had forgotten clues that I didn't think were important. The actual puzzles they put in the mix up the game play aren't challenging either, but they were kind of entertaining, I just wish they were harder. Then personally I wished the characters had more connections to each other, everyone felt like they were on their own little narrative island, with no relation to the other characters except for the murderer, the victim, and occasionaly, their single ""friend"" character.But all that aside, the game was still fun. The visuals are smoothe, the voice acting is good, the soundtrack is great, the characters have simple, but not boring personalities, the mechanics are fun, although the walking mechanics (don't forget you can fast travel) and navigating your notes can be a pain. So overall, I liked this game. If I had to describe it in one word, I think I would say the game is ""charming."" I can't honestly say the game is worth seven dollars, I typically don't mind short games that cost a bit, but this game doesn't seem like its worth that much (five dollars would have been more reasonable). But I picked this up on a steam sale for a dollar, and I feel like I got my dollar's worth.

,Recommended,272600,18585553,"Posted: 20 October, 2015",all,TordenFaaret,"What to say about Detective Grimoire. Well, here's something: It's okay.I first stumbled upon the game on Kongregate, some time before the sequel (this game) was announced. I remember thinking ""this was really fun!"". It wasn't something huge or ground-breaking, but it was a pretty cool little gem. And, to be fair, it's not trying to be grand, and I can respect that. It's not the issue I have with this game. This game is much of the same. The story is fine, the gameplay is pretty standard, but the art is definitely eyecandy.So here's the story: You are detective Grimoire, and you've been called out to a swamp, to investigate a murder in a tourist attraction. The supposed killer is the mascot on which the attraction was built: a swamp monster. You meet a cast of colorful characters, note in your pad who is suspicious and who isn't, go over the evidence and play a silly flash game from the early 2000's until the murderer is finally caught.So what are the good things? Well, characters and voice-acting. Both are really good, and I can't really point out many places that broke immersion (there is ONE, but we'll get to that). Their dialogue is fun and interesting, and breaking their safeguards on certain points is pretty satisfying because they keep denying or outright fighting you on the subject. The art, of course, is beautiful and colorful (much more interesting to the eye might I add, which begs the question: why are none of the triple-A companies taking advantage of more colors in their games?).Unfortunately, there were quite a few things I disliked about this game. The little girl character is more or less there because she was in the first game (like, really, she gives you a map and pleads for you not to arrest the swamp monster). The aforementioned flash game from the early 2000's really stands out from the rest of the game style-wise (and in early 2000's flash game fashion, the sounds are really loud). The setting is almost the same as the first game. The ending is pretty weak (first gave us a psychotic freak-out, this one has mythical monsters), and the section leading up to it is so straight forward, it almost crumbles the rest of the cookie. See, whether or not you note one of your suspects as the only suspect, you will be pointed to the actual murderer so long as you take the right dialogue choices in the first part of fetching the murderer. So if you thought that wormy guy was the murderer, whoops! Looks like it was this other guy all along! The only difficult part of the game is finding all the clues and details, which really chips down in hindsight.Then, who finally catches the murderer? What ending is this totally okay game bestowing upon us? The swamp monster. Honestly, I wasn't even angry. I was disappointed. This is a game that seems like it could be centered around our world, one that never hinted to a supernatural element (apart from the witch who turned out to be a herbalist, which I guess is witchcraft to the uninitiated), and yet here they spring an actual monster on us. I was really disappointed, because this could have been my scooby doo (there's no such thing as monsters and the whole kahoozie), and I really really REALLY wanted to like this game.In a way, though, I want you to give it a try. It's an unrefined gem, dusty and unclear, in need to find its own place in a chunk of ore. There is potential, definitely, but I don't know if the series will continue from here on (though there are characters to grab and hold on to, and the visual style is a five-star lobster dinner to the eye), but as is, it's pretty harmless."

A real shame, as when I was getting started I thought I had found a hidden gem.I single out the sound in this game as being particularly excellent.I have to emphasise just how easy and predictable it is- I read it in other reviews and thought the quality of the game would make up for it and I would just enjoy the story, which is why I bought it. Unfortunately the quality of the game's technical polish simply makes it more disappointing as I felt it could have been something really great but instead became an increasingly boring waste of time.To be absolutely clear- this is not a game I believe an adult can really enjoy as it lacks complexity, gameplay, challenge and storyline.This may be most suitable for about 7-11 year olds (I guess), there are references to a murder but it's all rather tame in comparison to something like ""Murder She Wrote"" or ""Colombo"". It should probably say it's for children on the store page- for that age group it is probably fantastic."

Yet what does that mean?The game involves you questioning subjects and looking around crime scenes for clues. You can question subjects about one of four topics, ask them about another character, or about an object in an inventory. Get enough clues and you get a special interrogation section with a character that plays out like a memory game, if you can remember the details, you will recieve an extra clue. Get even more clues after that and you will play a matching game that allows you to also recieve an additional clue. All to discover the solution to the mystery. Forgot details? Don't worry every single clue is written down for your convenience. There are even a few puzzles like trying to open a door available as well, but these are trivial.On the possitive aspects Detective Grimoire is a creative game with bright vibrant characters with voice acting and animation that instantly brings them to life in a way few games ever achieve. The world is quite fleshed out and mildly interesting as well as a tourist attraction in a swamp feels like a place that really could exist. The game is very intuitive and discovering who the criminal is stems naturally from the clues given to the extent where you could solve the case in your head without the need for sudden reveals.The negative aspect of the game can be summed up as busy work. There is an old saying that in adventure games when you get stuck you need to use everything on everything else. Detective Grimoire is a game based around using everything on everything else and unfortunately in some cases it is what you genuinely need to do. You will sometimes find yourself bringing up every item and suspect to every single character... Now you might think to yourself ""But divulging that I am onto the criminal might scare them away or put me in danger."" Not so in Detective Grimoire, you can bring up all the evidence you need to catch the criminal to the criminal and they won't even bat an eye. Essentially making this feel like a large game of ""busy work"" instead of a full blown detective game. It is also a bit on the short side.Difficulty wise the game is easy. Hints are on by default, essentially it will give you solutions, and even with them off occasionally the hints they give in the game should entirely give the puzzle away. There is no game overs and the game even has a system to tell you when you missed something. If you think Telltale point and clicks are too hard, this game is for you.This game confuses me because on paper I should dislike the game because it is incredibly easy and ultimately requires no real problem solving... Yet I actually like the game because of its atmosphere, voice acting, and world building as well as the characters that inhabit it. It helps that it is priced quite fairly.I give this a 8/10By the by, those 3 hours on record? I beat the game in that time, and probably could have done it faster."

Unfortunately I found it too short and with no actual puzzle/thinking part. I found myself mostly going through the story by a constant clicking due to too obvious selctions. Clues, notes and characters sheets turned out to be more of a to-do list that a useful part to solve the mystery. I knew who the murderer was towards the end of the game but wasn't able to finish it until i went back to find a clue I missed early in the game. Overall it took me less than 3 hours, and that is by not skipping voice dialogs. If you like adventure games and you find this on sale, give it a shot, it's a good game to spend some spare time. At full price I don't feel to recommend it, unless you're purchasing it for your kid."

I can see what the game wanted to be, and it has all the elements to be a great game but falls rather short in the end.Pros:Voice ActingBackground ArtCons:The plot is rather rudimentary, the 'mystery' isn't that difficult to solve. It feels like a chore to trudge through all the dialogue searching for clues.The ""puzzles"" can't even really be called puzzles, they are far too simple. The only real puzzle is at the end of the game where you use commons sense to figure things out.There are no consequences to any of your actions/choices so it all seems very pointless.The game practically holds your hand the entire way through, as opposed to letting the player figure things out, i.e). you'll find a clue of some sort and the game immediately launches you into what can be compared to the logic system used in the Phoenix Wright games, this causes the game to feel rather disjointed.The writing isn't terrible but it's not good either, it tries all too hard to be funny and witty."

But it's just too simplistic, too linear (their jokingly ""non-linear"" circular map notwithstanding), and too forgiving. The environment often provides too few cues as to where you need to click in order to find the requisite clues, and likewise the topics that will or won't prove helpful when talking to a given suspect are not necessarily intuitive. Basically, just click on every square inch of each scene until, go through every possible conversation topic with every possible person, and you'll complete the game in two hours with zero consequences. I guess that could be construed as ""kid-friendly"" or something, but ultimately this isn't so much a game as it is a simplistic demonstration of how investigation kind of works. And to round it all out, the voice acting is quite hit-and-miss.I applaud the idea and the effort, and I hope these guys use it as a springboard for a more ambitious project, but for now I can't call it a worthwhile experience."

It was mostly impressive within cutscenes, while in-game it looked a bit stale and clunky at times (incl. during dialogue sequences). But all in all a fairly good artstyle.The gameplay is very simplistic point-and-click. Very much just running around the map, clicking on things until you find the solution, as it switched chapters for me twice just going around the map a singular time. It does not make any effort to hide the fact that it was ported over from mobile platforms, as it continuously reminds you to ""tap"" things instead of ""clicking"" them. Not that I find it at all hampering to the overall process of playing it.The story itself is quite kid-friendly, actually, which I find to be a rather curious matter-of-fact seeing as the case entirely revolves around a murder... which is not all that kid-friendly. Nonetheless, the story did actually grab me in enough to play through the entire two or so hours as I frantically clicked away at things. In the end, a cute little story.Something that I should mention is that I, personally, had some weird framerate issues. They mainly occurred after playing for more than half-an-hour or so, and would only affect interactions with objects within the world - but it did not affect the menus, the dialogue or the cutscenes. It might only be me experiencing this, as no one on the forum seems to be complaining about such issues at the time.SincerelyCrayt"

It's a sequel to the Fairgrounds Detective Grimoire story.  Both stories are good and can be played through in about 2-3 hours.  This makes the replay value low, but the story was wonderfully woven together.  Sort of like murder mysteries you read, you remeber whodunnit the second time you read, but it's still a good story.I thought the characters were all amusing and the voices were done well.  The music fit the theme and wasn't distracting.  It helped break up the silence.I navigated by the map instead of walking most of the time, so I didn't run into some characters until the end.  I would like it if you could include the original Fairgrounds game in the next release.  Also, a second case would be nice.  Or perhaps multiple cases going in different locations.  I missed being able to challenge people about lying like in the first game.  Not everyone tells the truth in a murder mystery.All in all, it was an excellent 3 hours.

People who are into mystery solving, speaking with the other rpg characters and collecting evdience will pretty much enjoy this games since the majoirty of the time you will be doing that. However, there are a couple small puzzle games that I actually did enjoy, like when you had to arrange your words to create the correct thought to simple arranges. They don't get too annoying, but some might be to easy.One of the best thing about this game I attracted to me personally was the art style. What I always love in point and click games are the environment that we get to take our time to explore, which the artist did a beautiful job with. Also the characters are fun to look at, like being in a children books as well as matching the humor with it. All of this is unique and memorable to look at. The artist who is responsible is named Catherine Unger, an animation graduated who also help develop the other Steam game ""Haunt the House: Terrortown"". Check out her blogspot to see all the artwork she has done before and some of the sketches she created for those games.Overall, this is a nice relaxing game to bring back the traditional two-dimesional animation, funny dialogue and pleasure exploration.

You examine the area to find clues, speak with witnesses/suspects, and solve some simple puzzles.  Grimoire himself is entertaining to listen to, and most of the other characters get good voice actors.  The one thing that I'd like to see changed about this game is the interrogation scenes.  These are the moments where you're supposed to confront the witness with evidence about what they're hiding from you.  It needs to have some challenge.  If you have the correct evidence, then you probably know what to present already.  You should be forced to consider what the evidence has in relation to this witness.

Slightly older, english speaking kids (maybe 8-12?) could have a very fun time solving this murder mystery on their own.Only negative remark I would have is that I found myself testing a lot of combinations (in dialogue or objects), perhaps out of old habit, which was tedious. I would chalk that up to being my bad actually, if it weren't for the fact that I found 1, maybe 2 wacky combinations that represent the reason why we would do this in older point and click adventures anyway.

My pro/con list belowPros:-Great aesthetic. Artstyle, voiceacting, and background music were all well done-Style of the adventure reminded me of the old freddi fish and pajama sam games which I loved as a kid-The narrative was well done and very creative. I loved unraveling the mystery of the murder and the swamp-I thought mechanically and interface wise, the detective work and clue gathering was well done. Oftentimes it's clunky in these sorts of games but was not the case here.Cons:-Puzzles were far too easy. They were definitely catered to a younger age group(but the content of solving a murder seems gauged to an older group) Would have been great to have difficulty settings for the puzzles to balance this.-Game felt very short. i got in the steam sale so much cheaper than the actual price, but I finished the whole game in 2.5 hours. I was expecting more depth. Worth it to me for what I paid, but may not be the most bang for buck at full price.-Repeat dialogue when mistakes on challenges, and no way to skip or fast forward through repeat conversations-Weird narrative hole with who the little girl following you around is. It really bugged me because they imply you know her but give you no context.Overall I would reccomend this game. Look elsewhere for challenging puzzles but if you love a good murder mystery this is worth sinking a couple hours into. It also appears to be SFBgames first real foray into this genre, so i imagine they will be able to really expand on this formula in the future(with ideally a longer sequel to this game)"

It's got some decent characterization, and a really interesting plot with a few good twists to it. I'm also really intrigued by what may be potential follow-up games for it. I really hope that they expand on that soon.The two points I really have to fault them for are that, one, there's a couple things early on that were poorly explained, but more importantly is that I had fairly significant issues getting the game to work right. The game starts up fine, but would frequently freeze up on me. This was on Ubuntu, and so while the game mostly worked smoothly, if this was a less enjoyable story, I'd have been very tempted to call it quits because of those constant problems."

This game is honestly amazingly high quality, from the art to the animation to the soundtrack and voice acting, but it's pretty clear this is made to be played by elementary school kids. Despite being a murder mystery with lots of secrecy and cryptids at heart, this game is very nongraphic and fairly noncreepy, and the puzzles mostly seem like things I solved in the newspaper when I was younger. This will not challenge you, and it will not trouble you.That being said, the tone of the game managed to avoid being condescending, which can be hard to find in kids' games. At no point in dialogue with characters did I feel like rolling my eyes because I was being talked down to. I genuinely enjoyed myself, and would gladly purchase more games of this series if they were to come out if only for the flawless design and voice acting. That being said, it is short.

From the quirky visual style to the well crafted and fully voiced dialogue; there is little not to like about it.It's not a terribly long game either - I played through the whole thing in one sitting - and while I might've enjoyed it more if it were longer (why not have more of a good thing after all), the story is self-contained and well-developed, feeling a bit like an episode of your usual crime TV-series. Additionally, looking at the price of the game, the length is perfectly justified.If I had to mention a bad thing about it, it would've to be the difficulty of its puzzles. I assume that many people buying a game such as this are looking forward to slipping into the role of a detective themselves, if only for a short while. The appeal lies in the collection of clues, interrogation of suspects and then putting two-and-two together in the end.Detective Grimoireoffers a variety of all these activities and, again, they are presented in a very creative way. But I felt that the difficulty level was too low, as none of the puzzles ever felt challenging.This might not be entirely bad, as it makes the game appropriate also for a younger audience, but to many it will feel like a very casual experience. Someone more interested in solving riddles might enjoy something likeSherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments, or even something likeAntichambermore.That being said, I do recommend givingDetective Grimoirea try.

Had to reinstall the game and let it idle in the background to get the last two cards.- The ""puzzles"" are a bit simple, and all (but one) can be solved almost by accident.- The ""internal monologue"" minigame feels like a great idea that wasn't fully explored, despite being the only recurring puzzle type. Hopefully, a sequel will expand on this, as it's a refreshingly logical alternative to the ""use inventory A on environment B"" trial-and-error ""puzzle"" typical of point-and-click games. It also would have been nice to be able to call up the ""thought puzzle"" UI at any time to come up with new lines of questioning, rather than only in response to scripted events, with too many ""obviously wrong"" options to be challenging.- The ""suspicion marks"" on suspects have NO bearing on any other aspect of the game, aside from one achievement. I expected them to have some effect on Grimoire's questioning of suspects, but no.- Despite the above objections, this game is ABSOLUTELY worth buying for $5 or less, and is definitely worth two to three hours of your time.- Headphones aren't actually necessary, but you will want to be able to hear the fantastic voice acting.

Oh my gosh, I'm SO glad I did. This game is incredible. As a fan of Ace Attorney style point and click games, this was a real treat. The soundtrack was downright beautiful, the animation was flawless and flowed gorgeously, the art style was very overly cartoony (which made looking at the character animations super fun) and the characters themselves all had very unique personalities that the art style conveyed very well. The voice acting work in this game was superb, it really was. The plot, though it ended on a 'To Be Continued', was still marvelously well done. It was just vague enough to put suspicion on everyone, but detailed enough so that finding out who did commit the crime was really interesting. I also found that playing it was not nearly as difficult as I had anticipated it was. Sure, finding out everything did prove to be a bit of a challenge for me, but it wasn't difficult to the point where I needed to look for a walkthrough online somewhere, which is something I'm guilty of doing a lot for videogames.As for negative points, I only have a couple. The first is that I managed to somehow complete the game without breaking into the tent (I couldn't find the code, but was told to visit the policeman to tell him my findings anyway), which is something I don't think I should have been able to do, and was a bit of a let down. My second criticism, is that the little girl that keeps randomly coming out of no-where needs some explanation, I think. I mean, did Grimoire imagine her? And if not, how does she know the Detective? What is up with her? Why does she keep vanishing? I really hoped the game would answer those questions, but they never did.Despite that though, I really enjoyed this game and I'd reccommend it to anyone. It was WAY worth my money. If anything, I'd expect something of that kind of quality to be more expensive (though I'm super glad it wasn't)."

,Recommended,272600,28999215,Posted: 3 January,all,James20,"Detective Grimoire takes a bit from the Ace Attorney series and adds in its own gameplay mechanism, which are sadly not well explained and could be left unused, to make a pretty good detective game with a muddling ending.Visually I really liked the fluidity of the animations, they may have been repetitive, but they felt natural to the characters. That said the game has all the earmarks of a flash game.  It definitely feels like it could have been released online instead of on Steam.As for the gameplay itself, it is very similar to Ace Attorney’s investigation gameplay (not the court room).  Go around talking to people, pick up evidence and find ways to open up new conversations with suspects.  The issue is there is even more to it than that, and it doesn’t illustrate how to use it.  I was expecting a standard point and click, but there’s actually a note system, a suspicion system, and map that details completion of each section.  You get a screen with about a dozen icons on it and no alternative hover text to tell you what they are.  This game really needed a tutorial case because I got to nearly the end of the game before even knowing some of those things existed.Speaking of that, the game gives the impression that they may have wanted to do more cases, but only one case is included. There is a place to go and “lab testing” but it becomes pointless by the end, you only test for 1 substance and the test itself is laughable.Okay but aside from all that. It’s actually a really good game. It includes some lock puzzles, it requires some searching and maintain cognizance of what’s going on in the game. The ending is a little lack luster but overall a detailed and fairly well developed story. Biggest issue with the ending is that it’s kind of obvious who the bad guy is long before you get to the end.Overal, Detective Grimoire is a pretty decent game that could have used either pairing down of unnecessary extras that were included or a detail tutorial chapter and gameplay change to make them useful."

It doesn't do anything groundbreaking in terms of writing or presentation. Although it does the job very well for what it is and has it's own charm. Didn't experience any game crashes or bugs. Very easy game to get into and play through in one hit.It's clearly geared towards kids with the skill level of the puzzles being extremely low. At times they felt like they were just testing the functionality of a tablet (where a game like this is better suited). For example at one point you're looking for a clue in a garbage can and just need to move the pieces of the trash out of the way to get to the bottom. It's hard to count that as a puzzle but you get the idea of the skill level involved for puzzles. However finding all the clues, eliminating suspects and confronting the killer was chilled out fun.Worth the price on a heavy discount and if you keep your expectations to a minimum before jumping in. The strangest thing about the game worth noting is the story/murder plot. I mean, it's clearly aimed toward the younger market but the plot revolves around solving a murder. What's up with that? It's not a grisly scene by any means but it felt like the theme was still a bit off. Although kids play Cluedo and watch CSI so this game is hardly going to corrupt them."

You are a detective, and you have to find clues, interrogate suspects, solve puzzles and piece it all together to solve a mystery.The game is like your average point and click game with walking around and looking for things to click on and then solving puzzles, but it adds more to it - there's quite a lot of interaction with suspects, browsing through your case files, noting what seems to be important in solving the mystery and what doesn't. While solving the mystery isn't too hard and the puzzles are very easy (also, the liquid mixing one was completely pointless), there's a whole lot of fun to be had.The story is my favourite part of the game - you're given some very simple information to start off with, but the mystery keeps building onto itself and giving you more and more questions, then tying them all together and providing satisfying answers near the end. The characters were interesting, but human-like, and, with each one having some evidence pointing towards them, you'll be guessing the murderer until the last moments. The dialogue was witty and the great writing was enhanced by the well done voice acting. There's also plenty of cool, small details that are easy to overlook - for example, during the question puzzles, where you have to make a question for the detective consisting of multiple parts, you can notice that there are some things that the detective keeps thinking about even though they're unrelated to the investigation. You can see the options ""my beard"" and ""my hair"" appear (Grimoire is worried about how he looks), or ""Sally's hair"" and ""Sally's legs"" (Implying that he has the hots for Sally). Little details like that don't add much to the game, but they make the characters seem more human and relatable, as well as giving you a small chuckle when you notice them.The artwork was done pretty well (noticeably the same people who did Haunt the House), the game was beautifully drawn while retaining a cartoony charm. The music wasn't anything out of this world, but it was good enough for me to notice it and enjoy listening to it while playing the game.For fellow completionists: All achievements in this game are very easy to get, and 100% completion comes in 2-4 hours. It's a bit short for my taste, but if you only care about the percentage, this one's for you.Overall, this game was very short but very fun and clever.

Basically whole game is about finding clues and fitting them together (mostly figuratively). There are also some easy puzzles.Clues can be objects or things that people tell. Clues help out figuring out what has really happened and what kind of people the suspects are. Some conversation subjects are not even available at the beginning as certain facts are missing.Game is pretty short. Completing it might take maybe three to four hours.

The graphics were also enjoyable though some of the game mechanics could have been slightly better.The ""puzzles"" are pretty easy which makes me wonder if the target audience was children. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed it!I hope they create additional content for this, I'd love to solve another case."

With an unique visual style and a whimsical cast of characters this game hooked me right from the start.Playing the eponymous Detective Grimoire, you are charged with solving a mysterious crime, that happened at a tourist attraction, located in the depths of a swamp. During your investigation, you will examine and pick up pieces of evidence, solve basic puzzles, as well as interview the inhabitants and workers at the tourist attraction. While these gameplay mechanics are nothing new, SFB Games make the best of it: Every once in a while you are faced with the task of forming a sentence out of pieces of evidence, characters and phrases (it is a rather simple system, but has lots of possible combinations, making a random success unlikely). This way, the developers make sure that you really understand what you are doing. If you form the right sentence you are rewarded with a ""challenge"", meaning that you can confront one of your suspects with your conclusions, often revealing important information. These systems are a perfect fit for the game and i found them to be very engaging.Detective Grimoire's Story is nothing exceptional, but rather well-crafted; the characters are distinct and intriguing with nice animations and well-written dialog. The visual design (most notably character design) is the most apparent selling point of this game and really gives it a special flair. Together with the athmospheric soundtrack it creates the impression of a lovingly created game.But enough praise, let's nitpick a little!Being a casual/children's game, Detective Grimoire will be prettyeasyfor most adult players (, but I think a perfect fit for younger audiences). Also, the game is available on mobile devices, too; which is basically a good thing, but is reflected in the ratherlow resolutionthe game is displayed in on the PC. This dampens the quality of the artworks a little and makes the menus appear a little overbearing.Last but not least: This game isvery short. I finished it in two and a half hours, and you might do so even faster. While this does not particularly bother me, many people on Steam seem to be very attentive, when it comes to game length.All in all, I would still recommend Detective Grimoire, because its flaws are extensively outweighed by its qualities. It is a very athmospheric, engaging Adventure, with some unique gameplay ideas and likeable cast of characters. If you have no problem with its brevity, I recommend it at its full price (6,99€ here in Germany).Have fun!"

The visuals, the art, the FOR ONCE NOT-BUMBLING DETECTIVE, the option to give snarky answers.The puzzles are easy to mid-difficult so it's perfect for kids age 12 and up!It's short but really super fun!Sadly it felt rushed in the end but it set up a TBC very nicely and I will definitely be purchasing the follow up! :D"

,Recommended,272600,35396130,Posted: 1 October,all,Ichigo,"D'aww, this game, guys.  It's just...not to sound girly, but it's friggin' cute.  And a pretty good murder mystery, to boot.The good points: relatively good cartoon animation, as you already see, as well as professional voice acting that at times made me forget it was a game, though that's not to say the 'cutscenes' are drawn out, as you play those parts as heavily as anything else.  It's simplicity means no glitches, and it's good for a wide range of ages (I'm 27, and played it with my 8-year-old nephew, and neither of us lost interest until the end).  All of the characters were interesting and fun to watch.Some puzzles threw me for a loop (well, one did) to the point where I just cheated and googled the answer while my nephew was in the bathroom, so adults shouldn't get cocky.  It's fun.  I'd rank it higher than Murdered: Soul Suspect, anyway.  It was more fun than L.A.Noire, though I won't claim that it's as authentic.  You'll have a good time.The bad points: it's only one murder mystery, which lasts around 3 hours if you're not cheating.  As far as the murderer goes, my nephew and I both called it as soon as we started talking to that person, so you might find it too obvious.  Figuring the murderer out isn't the hard part, though, you have to prove it by having the evidence and using it at the right time.  It's not exactly Ace Attorney, but it's interesting.  Oh, and if you're worried about a rating for kids, it being a murder mystery is about as bad as it gets.  The detective says 'damn' once, there's a flirty souvenir seller, and you have to walk into a room filled with cartoon taxidermy, but that's nothing compared to Simpsons, Futurama, or Family Guy.  Honestly, it's more along the lines of Gravity Falls.Tl;dr, you should get the game.  It'll be fun."
