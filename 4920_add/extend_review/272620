,Recommended,272620,32605926,Posted: 20 June,all,Chrisco80,Good ol Serious Sam. Just like I remember it. If it was top-down. With retro graphics. And had rpg elements. Good times!Pros:-Everything I already said plus all the good stuff others saidCons:-Wont run on my Super Nintendo
,Recommended,272620,32711613,Posted: 23 June,all,Guardian_Angel,"That's pretty good for a 2-dimensional game set in the world of the iconis Serious Sam universe. I think it's their (Croteam-promoted) best indie-game so far:The good:- Even though this is a pixelated game, the graphics are really neat. The sight of a whole screen covered with explosions and guts of the aliens floating around is simply great. Gets absolutely extreme with miltiple players.- The game contains a rich variety of enemies. The bestiary includes enemies brought from each and every single SS game: Kleers, Gnaars, Biomechanoids, Kamikazes, orcs, Cucurbitos, Siribulls and others.- The OST is awesome, it cleverly mimics the classic tracks of older Serious Sam songs.- Level diversity is good enough. From Gall-damned Egypt to Turkey, then Greece and, finally, Moonbase.- The game supports online Co-op up to 4 players and PvE + Survival with up to 12 freaking players each. Level editor is also an option.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The bad:- The 2-dimensional gameplay gets boring and monosyllabic quickly. It's an a lot simplified version of an original SS, although it still is fairly hard when multiple types of enemies start raining hell down on you all together.- Gore system is totally crude. All regular enemies just fall apart, independent of what weapon you're using. Like, I'm not sure, if akimbo pistols can turn someone into a bloody mess in 2 shots, honestly. That takes away a lot of satisfaction that you should've had when killing alien scum.- Some dev level design strokes are getting so repetitious throughout the gameplay they actually start bringing annoyance. Like the mine fields or transportation teleporters.- Online is an absentee right now. The only lobby I found had just 1 player and he even have quit before long.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion:I do recommend you to have a closer look at this game, either if you're a Serious Sam fan or have friends willing to play the game too OR both. The game is fairly priced and can deliver a good loads of fun for a good amount of time.7/10"

I very much enjoyed the experience..."
,Not Recommended,272620,32609474,Posted: 20 June,all,RERLTuna,"Good game, but falsely advertised. Literally in the trailer they are all sitting around on a couch with controllers playing this game. But there's no couch co-op. What.UPDAT 06/21/17E- I guess they finally have revealed they are indeed working on couch co-op. So I'll re-review it once I run through it with a buddy. I'll have to rebuy the game of course. Wish they would have let us known sooner."
,Not Recommended,272620,33192350,Posted: 3 July,all,Fishfish,"I'll start this off by saying i enjoyed hammerwatch and i enjoyed the serious Sam games, but i did not enjoy this game.The levels are massive, like way too big, combine that with no map and It turns combat into tedium as you kill a few enemies then walk around aimlessly looking for the next few.Some of the upgrades actually have downsides which doesn't make sense since you have to earn them. It would have been better fitted as a game mutator in some cases.Exploration doesn't feel as rewarding in the game when you could spend 10 minutes and find one ammo pack or at most a star that goes towards upgrades, but that fell back on my second issue of not even feeling like upgrading.I would suggest Hammer watch over this title if you have never played before, otherwise i think anything else would be better for scratching a top down shooter itch.edit: there is a 'map' if you can call it that which is just a rough outline of the mission area, but it in no way describes where you are or where to go next. In the Serious Sam fps games the lack of map is fine since you can actually see a far distance in front of you so you can see the next point of interest, that does not carry over in a top down game however."
,Recommended,272620,32597536,Posted: 20 June,all,ZeroTacTiX,"This game is EXACTLY what you'd expect it to be. All the enemy types and guns of all the Serious Sam games, only this time you're playing it top down.Although it's VERY Serious Sam esque in its action, the level design is akin to classic Doom and the clones. You might even occasionally get lost in a level, as the level design is not seemingly, but most definitely maze - like. You backtrack to collect color keycards and ammo/health, you micro manage your ammo pick ups so when you have 19 Cannon Balls, you don't accidentally walk on a large Cannon Ball ammopack that gives you 10 more balls. You get what I'm saying.All the elements of classic fps games are incorporated in this top down shooter, and it works just perfectly. The pacing is perfect, and there are occasional horde scenarios which makes you all sweaty, soon to be followed by relief, as you take your time to breathe, you're killing some well placed enemies who come 1 by 1, just so you feel all godlike again. Brilliant pacing, great position requiring gameplay, just brilliant.There is a light RPG system, as you can upgrade your health, movement speed, carry 10% more max ammo, make the shotgun fire slightly longer but with lesser spread, etc. I found this to only compliment the game well as it doesn't take away from the overall action experience, and it gives you the challenge escalation, games like these need to have.What's more? The game supports Ultrawide 21:9 resolution, and it deserves to be applauded for that as not many indie games such as these support them.Great game, great fun,and if you don't mind the pixellated graphics and a good challenge, you got yourself an awesome game.. It's probably the best ""Game"" I've played all year, I just wish it had Nex Machina style graphics n animations. This isn't a bullet hell game, but I think the enemies and guns in Serious Sam have the best ""variety"" making combat more fun and diverse, than dodging the same kind of 'bullet hell' the entire game. I love this game and highly recommend it."

76561198012327487,Recommended,272620,33771201,Posted: 24 July,all,Kobest,"Serious Sam's Bogus Detour is a fantastic run'n'gun shooter.It is really a Serious Sam game at heart: you will be frantically running backwards, changing weapons and dealing with a nice variety of enemies all at the same time. There is an ideal weapon for each situation and the developers have improved Sam's arsenal in a very good way. The levels are simply massive with plenty of secrets, and you have a good incentive to find them since even an RPG-like progression system was added to our hero's adventure.The content on offer here is nothing short of amazing. Just beating the game on serious difficulty in co-op took us around 14 hours, and we haven't even touched the survival mode and the Steam Workshop mods. Any difficulty level above normal is pretty challenging, though some players might find it off-putting to replay these huge levels over and over to master them. Since I enjoyed the game a lot, I wanted to get all the achievements, but heck, that would take a really long time.I seriously (pun intended) have no idea why it doesn't have more players at the moment. It is a fun, addicting game and it is also a blast in co-op! Remember those games in your primary/high school computer rooms that would keep the kids there for hours and hours? This one is just like those!Serious Sam's Bogus Detour earns my recommendation easily even at full price."
,Recommended,272620,32667191,Posted: 22 June,all,Dr.Tr1gger,"Very addicting game with beautiful graphics and great music. RPG elements give it additional replay value and I bet it's even more fun in CO-OP mode (no friends so I'm just guessing on this one).First time in the series normal shotgun is more usable than super shotgun :VGame also comes with editor which lets you do basically whatever you want. Well unless you can't really code (like me) so then you are limited to making maps.Some things that I didn't like are:- Giant arsenal of weapons but during campain most of them are useless. Played the whole thing just using 4 best guns unless out of ammo.- Sometimes it's not clear which objects are just decoration and which will block you. Died many times getting stuck on a single meat piece hidden in a pool of killed enemies.- Destroying the batteries is really annoying and repetetive. Shoot with cannon, run away with flamethrower and repeat x8Everything else is great in my opinion. Definitely worth checking out."
,Recommended,272620,32690461,Posted: 23 June,all,Hamster Gutz,"This game is really great.  I never knew I wanted a Serious Sam top-down shooter until this came out.  It perfectly captures the feel of the FPS games but from a top-down perspective.  The pixel artstyle is really well done too.   It has all the guns from the First/Second encounters plus a few new ones, and they all have the original sound effects too. I've almost finished the game and I totally recommend it for fans of either top-down arcade shooters or Serious Sam(or both)."
76561198092369884,Recommended,272620,33787996,Posted: 25 July,all,stevevolnutt,"Insanely Awesome and Fun game Highly RecommendedIf you love top down shooters, serious sam, hammerwatch and chaotic shooting this game is for you.It mixes the best of both worlds of serious sam and hammerwatch together makes a really great game especially for multiplayer.Its way too easy on easy mode its recommended to start on normal to experience it as fun and challenging.The game runs smoothly if you set the FPS at unlimited and its not really a issue since the game doesnt have extremely intense graphics.However the retro art style of the game fits very well with nice colorful environments and character animations that are very pleasing to the eyes.The classic serious sam weaponry and new innovative weapons ""not counting the sniper rifle"" they all work adequetely to cutting down mental's horde.There is a depth of liveliness in the maps having non combatant units and breakable environment for added chaos.There are more enemies implemented in the game including the the old cast of enemies discounting some old and adding new ones but it doesnt impact the entertainment factor of the gameplay.The effort to make new enemies or non combatants wasnt necessary but the developers really wanted to give a new twist to impress the players with nostalgia with a hint of surprise.The bosses are progressively more challenging and gives different twists on how you should fight them instead of straight up brute forcing with makes it a lot more fun to strategize and play with friends or touch up skills on singleplayer.Even enemies have distinct different attack patterns that encourages the player to use different weaponry, prioritize targets and experiment with strategies with the more encounters that the player has with the enemy roster and weapons in the game.There are no moments i can think of where i can consider an enemy placement or part of the game i can label as cheap of where it uses trial and error to just kill the player making a unnecessary death making artificial difficulty.Just like when you can see the enemies outline behind the topdown view obscured by walls so you can see their locations.There is a bit of a problem of the game's maps being really large without a map its a easy to get lost sometimes but with a bit of searching after a minute youll find the way to the exit surely.There is a pace breaker mid game where it forces you to use the sledgehammer and takes all of your weapons away counting that the game gives fair amount of weight to your arsenal gives a sense of starting over again but in a fun way.Every weapon that there is in the game has a purpose even the pistols are still useful for taking out smaller hordes of gnaars or kleers or even shooting weak ranged unit enemies from a distance while dodging making a good weapon for ammo conservation.The sledgehammer was poorly implemented however because youll hardly find any incentive to use it when you can just use the pistols as they have unlimited ammo if you are trying to conserve ammunition for other guns including the fact you will fight many at once and in a melee scuffle with melee units you will have difficulties not getting hit and its out of the question for ranged enemies because you wont have any time to dodge the incoming projectile from such a close proximity when your trying to run towards them. Why would you use a more riskier lower damage output weapon when you can stay back and shoot with the pistols as a alternative for ammo conservation.For the price of not even a full game you surely get a lot for your money its worth a buy even if your not a fan of serious sam or hammerwatch.Best play the game with friends for the laughs and singleplayer for the experience and story.Either way the game is a awesomely crafted masterpiece, Its a breath of fresh air from modern games youll love it to the core."

,Recommended,272620,33013716,Posted: 29 June,all,UnluckyNinja,"The game in short: Pixelized top-down version of Serious Sam. Great artwork, fantastic recreation of original game essence, decent level design.And you can see it from other reivews. So I give this game a thumb-up. It's a good game.But I want to mainly talk about the editor or the mod support.It looks good outside, however inside the process is rather miserable.The editor is too shabby. It can barely get the job done.There is not much of GUI. A history panel stores up to 10 action for you to undo, taking up 1/6 of the window, while most part of it is blank, and you can't increase the number of records. Some resource tabs, with only the path-styled string identifying them. A view of game camera and a properties tab. That's all.The mapping is a disaster. There is no any general tool helping you do the job. Tiles are unselectable, which means you can't move it or enlarge it, or even know what tileset it is, and you can only erase a piece of tile by using the same tileset! For god's sake! I just want to clean that specific tile, no matter what there is.So I have to become Holmes to figure it out? Or Stanley tryin them out one by one?Which make it worse, there is no panel tracking entities you put in the level, not to mention layer/group management. What you got is the camera only, do the management with your eyes.They uses AngelScript as the script language. But if we can use C#/Lua/Javascript/Python it will be better.The API is roughly documented, nothing much you can get from it. The wiki is far from finished, but seems to be in (not that) active development.I used to make a map or two for Super Fighters Deluxe. At that time I feel there is plenty of inconvenience using the editor. But now I think their editor was masterpiece."

I didn't, and still don't know a lot about the serious sam franchise.Once I was able to buy the game(after a long time of hyping over another game from these developers), I wasn't sure what to think, I am not much of a fan of twinstick games of this nature but it works surprisingly well, and while I do still find myself missing HW style of gameplay, this is still a great game in its own that makes a feature I am not all that fond of work for it."

76561198013544882,Recommended,272620,32833582,Posted: 26 June,all,zackrobbman,"The game is great! The level up system makes it worth it to explore levels and find all the secrets, the enemies are fun to fight even in ridiculous numbers, the art style is spot on and filled with effort, the music is catchy, very few cheesy moments that cost you a life or game-over, (except one big one that is unacceptable) and the sound effects give the action that extra bit of push to make it more tense. I also liked the optional tweaks added in to make the game even more enjoyable. All I can suggest to make it better is include upgrades for EVERY weapon. The scrollbar on the side of the upgrade menu tells me you guys plan to do so at some point. ;)Only two things I hate about this game are these: No one's ever playing online to utilize half the fun(can't say that's your fault though), and the last level. You guys might think it's funny to make the players concentration and time worthless because of one barely-made mistake, but none of us do and after failing for the second time and replaying the level twice over, (a total of two hours or more after finding all the secrets AGAIN) I never want to play this game again. I've never felt more insulted by a game in my life. That instant game over stuff is why I don't touch games from the past.SPOILERS: I equipped the sledgehemmer and ROLLED as fast as I could to the exit, but still failed because the hangar had to boot up once I got there. FIX THAT. Make the boot-up sequence a CUTSCENE, or let the player immediately escape upon TOUCHING THE SHIP.  Or, if you WANT things to be unecessarily difficult, at least let the player restart at that last boss rather than make them replay the entire level, LOSING the three level-ups they gained so that their time is COMPLETELY wasted. If I had kept the levels, I seriously might not have minded. It's not FUN to re-do all that to get those levels back, even if the level IS fun. PLEASE reconsider that last bit...seriously. We get that playing a game is wasting time, but that's just going too far and being flat-out disrespectful. Especially when the player MAKES IT TO THE SHIP."

There is no single screen local coop as shown in the gameplay trailer and the only way you can play with a  friend on a couch (this is exactly what we see in the trailer) is via console commands and that gives you split screen and single screen with players in the same area. This is false advertising and a shame. The developer keeps saying there are problems with local coop even though their main ad is based on that feature.
