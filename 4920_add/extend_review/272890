The game controls aren't difficult to grasp, the music and sounds are well designed, and the interface is nice and clean, not interfering with the graphics -- did I mention they were gorgeous?  Oh, yes, I did.The hummingbird and rewind features are welcome additions to the basic gameplay of minigolf.  In fact, given the complexity of some of the holes, they're requirements.  The availability of a wedge in addition to a putter is welcome, adding a level of strategy absent in other minigolf games.The game is also eminently playable -- on the more advanced courses, there are several ways to play each hole, so there's little repetition even with the limited number of courses.  If it has a boredom factor, I haven't reached it yet.The BadWhile I have not identified the game's boredom factor, it does have a frustration factor, and it was found quite quickly.There are difficult holes.  There are even diabolical holes -- the par 3 8th at OSU Scarlet, when the pin is set in that card-table sized tongue of green sticking out into the pond, comes to mind as a real-world example.Vertiginous Golf, unfortunately, includes a few unplayable holes, where the line between success and failure is both unmarked and razor thin.  The penalty for failure is vastly out of proportion to the value of success -- and scores rapidly balloon out of control, rendering an entire round not much more than an exercise in futility.  And if I want futility, I can just load up my clubs and go play some real golf (which can fairly be described as two shots worthy of Tiger hidden within one hundred twenty worthy of Tigger).On the plus side, this is the worst I have to say aboutVertiginous Golf-- but since it's central to game play, it's of importance.The SkinnyOverall, I'll give 7.5/10, though I would strongly recommend the designers re-visit some of the holes and dial it back a little.  I don't expect an ace every time, but neither do I expect to be condemned to ten or more strokes because I missed a tee shot by the faintest of margins.On the cosmetic side, I'd like to suggest allowing the player to choose their ball color (or if that's already in the game, making it more obvious as I haven't found it yet).  We golfers are a superstitious lot, and I (think I) play better with a blue or green ball than with a red one.  :DA course designer would be another welcome addition -- way back in ancient times (i.e., the 1990s), the Jack Nicklaus series of golf games always included course design tools, and some of the fan-made courses were genuinely brilliant.  The vast array of additional free content also kept the JN games playable far longer than most other games released at the same time.Overall, this game isRecommendedon the basis of design and creativity, and in the hopes that some of its frustration factor is ironed out by the time of its official release."

I have to put that between brackets because although this is more or less traditional mini-golf, it doesn't look or feel like it at all. Imagine playing minigolf on islands in the sky with twisted, devious and brilliant courses in a steam-punk world remeniscent of Bioshock Infinite.From the moment you start this game up and are greeted with one of the most innovative and immersive menu systems I have ever seen in a computer game you know you are in for something special.As of writing the game is feature complete and I have not noticed any bugs, there are two courses of 9 holes and a training hole. So don't let the Early Acces label scare you off, this is the first EA game I have purchased and I am glad I did. Appart from adding about 30 more holes and tweaking this game could be considered finished.Oh did I mention this game was rock-hard? Don't be surprised to get 20, 30 or even 40 over par on your first attempts at a hole. Getting the first hole in one is going to be an epic challenge.This is obviously a labour of love, the passion the developers have put into this project shines through in every aspect of Vertiginous Golf. You owe it to yourself to give this a shot if you are intrigued, because this is one of the better examples of video games being art without being pretentious. The stylish design and gameplay blend together perfectly and it never feels contrived.I highly recommend this to anybody looking for a beautiful, relaxing but also very challenging experience."

It may require a painstaking amount of precision and tremendous amounts of trial and error but in the end when it all comes together and you are making par you feel truly accomplished.UPDATE: 7/12/14Being as most reviewers on here have not spent that much time with game (except for rabid) this is the truly unique golf game, that fans of ""wacky"" golf games have been waiting for.  If Kirby's dream course was a turn based strategy game this would be the RTS equal.  This game makes you think more than a puzzle game and react more than a FPS. It is incredibly well made and gets better by the month.  The only downside I can see to recommending this game is that it will affect my positions on the leaderboards. YOU GUYS ROCK. Thanks for making a great game and letting us go along for the ride as I am sure it will become the standard which golf games are measured by."
,Recommended,272890,12441337,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,Thirdrail,"Why does miniature golf need to be miniature? Why can't it be the scale of regular golf, so I'm putting through three hundred yards of bumpers and windmills and rollercoasters? Also, why can't mini-golf have lots of mechanical hummingbirds?Obviously, we've all asked these questions. Now Vertiginous Golf is here to answer them.It's insanity, but it all works well. It's fun and polished, especially for a tiny indy production like this one. The multiplayer is the star of the show. Charming and imaginative describe virtually every inch of what exists in Vertiginous Golf.My only real complaint is lack of content. It needs more courses. Partly, that's Early Access. But, the future goals say the final game will have 45+ courses, and it will need to be double that, at least, because it IS miniature golf. Real golf is about honing nuances. Miniature golf, at any scale, is far more dependent on novelty factor. As cool and robust as these course designs are, they're not anything you're going to play fifty or a hundred times. The game needs so many holes that by the time you finish the final holes, you can no longer remember the early holes clearly. That's the only way this will ever be anything more than an incredibly cool way to spend an evening or two. The only way this will ever be a real game.My hope is that this will turn into a more expensive game, with far, far more content, instead of remaining a cheap game which inevitably starts pushing the edges of its content after just a few hours. At the moment, it reminds me a lot of the disc golf sector of the ps3 game Sports Champions - BRILLIANT, but give me more of it. A *lot* more of it."

76561198058024753,Recommended,272890,12430976,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,OscarMayerWinner,"(October 9th)I just recently got this game and already my friends and I love it. We got it after the multiplayer update and have had a blast messing around it. The singleplayer and multiplayer have multiple options for you to choose from. So you can either make it challenging for yourself by removing the bug influencer, playing on a only green map, or if with your friends play with weapons.There are also multiple ways to play the multiplayer matches. So far from what I've played they have a regular golf match (9 holes) and they have a race type. Now typically for the regular match it's kind of like a race but you can go at your own pace. My friends and I personally like to take turns and whatnot but you can play however you want.So I haven't put as many hours into this game as some of the other people here, but I LOVE this game. Just because you play a course doesn't mean you can't go back and play it again. With how the holes are setup, there are multiple ways about getting to your goal. So if you mess up, keep going, and come back some other time and try to beat your score on how you did it before. There are just so many possibilities.Now this game is currently in Early Access but it's still a great game for where it is at. So here are some Pros and Cons that I have come to find about this game.Pros:-Replay Value (a ton, I really don't see how I could run out of options especially if Steam Community gets involved)-Lovely Graphics (freaking beautiful)-Some minor customization on your playing style (no bug influence, yes/no weapons)-Very smooth gameplay (I play on Splendid graphics and framerate is great)-Easy concepts to grasp (Left mouse camera, right mouse shoot) (there is more but you get the picture)-Online Multiplayer (little buggy but whatever, still cool)-Hilarious to laugh at friends as you explode their ball into oblivion (bombs are awesome. You can explode their ball out of the hole)-Nine 9 hole courses so far (increases in difficulty each one)-Button customization (don't like how it's setup? No prob, set it to what you want)-8 player multiplayer (freaking 8. I haven't had that many friends on here yet but seriously, imagine the chaos of 8 people placing traps for others. Huehuehuehue)Cons:-Online Multiplayer Servers:Everytime you go to multiplayer you search a region to play in. For some reason it has it set to Europe as default for me when I live in the US. I would like to click on US and search for things there, but it has to search for every game in the regions, which could take some time, stalling for even longer. So if there was a way to have a choice on which region you want to play would be nice.-Online Multiplayer Options:Yes you have a lot of options to choose from, and that is awesome, BUT, if you try to change the course instead of repeating the level, you might accidentally mess up and have to restart the hosted game.-Online Multiplayer Lobby:I love the fact that you can create your own lobby, it's cool, but you don't have many options in your lobby. Your lobby is always public, so anyone can join. Which is sometimes irritating if I'm waiting for my friends to join. So they join whatever, you can ask them to leave, but they don't always. So you have to restart the lobby. Why? Because you have no kick option.-Weapon selection:This is kind of minor but I wish there was a way to choose your weapon with a specific button rather then having to press 'c' 4 times to get what I want. Maybe I can select how I want to set it up and I'm being stupid. I haven't explored all the button options yet, but I haven't seen any options for it.-Camera:It's pretty good for the most part, but sometimes you get stuck near a pole and can't see where you are trying to put. Other games have fixed this by making those see through but everything is solid, so on the rare occasion if you get stuck, you kind of have to hope you hit it to the right spot because you can't see.Yes I have some issues with the online multiplayer, but I can't blame the developers, this option just came out October 6th so I don't expect this feature to be perfect, there are some things anyone/anything can improve on.There are also some other features that they said they plan on bringing to the game later on. Such as a LOT more customization. Avatars, Putters, Golf Balls, and Levels. Freaking Levels. They said they plan on bringing in Steam Community to this game. Players from all around will be creating their own levels with the level customization will be used (they plan on bringing that and hopefully will). There is so much they can do with this game, I'm just so excited to see what they will do.So long story short, this game rocks my socks off. I love mini golf in real life and this game really only limits people to their imagination. I hope to see this game keep going and come out with all the features they plan on.TL;DR - Den outta Den"
,Recommended,272890,9684675,"Posted: 31 March, 2014",all,Vloshko,This Game is the most challenging game I have ever played. And that says a lot. In addition it is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. If you enjoyed minigolf games back in the late 1990's at your work computer or while at school then this is the game for your current self and mind. You will not be dissapointed. Heck this game could even help you with billiards.
,Recommended,272890,12431438,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,Andem,"This game is really pretty cool. It's a minigolf game with a really cool fantasy-esque atmosphere and neat little contraptions all over. You build up power with swings and can use either a rewind button or a little jet thingie on your ball to move it slightly where you want. At first it seems like rewind is incredibly OP but the game gets fairly challenging and fairly fast. To the point it might even get a bit frustrating to some people. Luckily I was playing it with my girlfriend so I did honestly have a good time watch us both screw up a few times. The game's got pretty good graphics and a neat art style and is surprisingly not too computer intensive too.It also has online now which they just added. I don't know if I'll do that myself as I'm more content with local, but it's cool to have the option to play with friends. Apparently has weapons and other fun junk if you want.Another reason I really enjoyed this game. The devs are really cool and seem to be very active even in the steam forums. I had a glitch that didn't allow me to play local multiplayer and made a thread here. The devs worked with me on it and in just a day they released a patch to fix it. That's something you don't see too often when it comes to early access and other junk and is certainly a breath of fresh air.I will admit the game is a tad big buggy and has the occasional physics or weird clipping bug, but its kind of hard to stay mad at it when it's an early access game. I expect it to be ironed out as time goes on. The devs were very open with what their update schedule is and what their plans are and have so far done what they said.Anyways, it's just a really nice mini golf game. If you want to play a nice relaxing (or a fairly challenging) game of minigolf you should really give it a shot. even though it is early access, it's a fun enough game even as it is right now and even goes on sale fairly often.its just fun ok. devs were swell and is looks cool. Not expensive either. Thanks ilu"

The mechanics allow for a new spin on a classic game which allows for hours of fun. Not to mention the level editor (Whilst a bit iffy at times, and can become laggy due to complexity - not an issue in the game however) allows for far more replayabilty. Whilst I cant recommend this game for those looking for a singleplayer experience, if you have a couple friends together and are willing to part with a bit of cash, you can have a lot of fun with this game."

I must admit, this game is more like a trajectory and timing puzzle than a true golf sim, with fans and bombs and persian rugs. But, if you love a challenge or love outlandish aesthetics, you'll get a kick out of this game. It is $10 I do not regret spending and that's all I ask for in a game."

Ever wanted to play artificial, steam punk golf in your mind? Then this is the game for you. Creative and fun courses to play are included in the game but if they get boring you can also play tons of user created ones. The gameplay is smooth and some unique mechanics like rewinding and meditation spice up the regular golf experience. One of the best golf games on steam!"

,Recommended,272890,28662032,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Capitalism,"Oh boy, Vertiginous Golf! Where do I even begin with this? I saw TieTuesday's archived stream of this game, and I was interested as a result. i only recently remembered, and I'm glad I did.The premise is simple: miniature golf in the sky. You have a special rewind function and a small engine to help push the ball in a certain direction. These both cost fuel, which replenishes as the ball moves. It's a fairly simple game with extra mechanics that aren't really hard to learn.The story is... certainly something. I'd have not expected a golf game to have some deep lore to it, but here we are. I'm not sure what else I can say about it outside of what's in the pitch that I could reveal without maor spoilers, so I'll leave this point at that.As for the atmosphere, it's amazing. Each course is beautifully animated, as is the hub world. The sounds are also a fitting inclusion, and the music really fits the mood when it kicks in.Moving onto the playability. I felt the controls were quite smooth, and the game was working well, from what I've seen. It's not so engaging in the single player mode, but if you can play this with some friends, it'll more than make up for that experience.So, all of that being said, what are my final thoughts? At the time of writing this, I haven't put too much time into this game, but with my current experiences with it, I can see myself sinking much more into it. If you're looking into a single player experience and don't absolutely love golf that much, I'd not suggest this (at full price, at least), but otherwise, it's totally worth it. Give it a shot, see how it goes."

That being said the atmosphere and graphics are awesome, and the controls really are not that bad. Plus I've yet to have a single frame drop issue or a major crash."
