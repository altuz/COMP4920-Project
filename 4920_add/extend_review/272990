76561198026299729,Recommended,272990,10246962,"Posted: 26 May, 2014",all,Shhh No More Tears,"DISCLAIMER / PROTIP: IF YOU SUFFER FROM EPILEPSY OR ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO FLASHING LIGHTS AND COLORS,  DON'T BUY OR PLAY THIS GAME... YOU'LL PROBABLY DIE.So after earning the achievement for playing a single round for 20 minutes and landing myself 4th on the global leaderboard, I suppose I can adequately evaluate this game:It's simple.It's fun.It will cook your eyes and strenghten your fingers.This game reminds me a lot of Super Hexagon for its simplicity; if you liked that game then you will probably like this one, but it is also a bit more... bizzare. The premise is simple: use the space bar to control a colored bar between the upper and lower limits on a ""gauge"" while the background flashes alternating colors and patterns. The closer to the top of the gauge you are the more points you earn per second, but if you TOUCH the top or bottom you lose a score multiplier A.K.A. your lives (think the Bit Trip series: reach zero multipliers and its game over). Periodically you can collect score bonuses near the bottom of the gauge and, if you so elect, press the CTRL button to start controlling 2 bars at once for twice the points.Problem is, the game doesn't like it when you start scoring high and progressively speeds the rate of color flashing, swaps patterns more quickly, stretches/shifts/flips the screen orientation, moves the location of the upper and lower limits, changes music, and even flashes text questions and pictures of cats when you least suspect it.It gets very difficult and I don't recommend playing for extended periods of time, especially on a large screen. That being said this can be a really fun game in small doses and getting put on the leaderboard is satisfying. In addition, after playing certain amounts more and more game modes unlock for you to try, tweaking one aspect of the game at a time to keep it fresh.In conclusion I would give this game an 8/10 as a casual, but challenging, lunch break spender. The only detracting aspects of this game for me are:-The music is good, BUT it could be better. I prefer something even more aggresive in this type of game to keep me focused.-The agressive strobing of bright colors for minutes on end make this game difficult to play for more than 10-15 minutes, basicaly forcing the player to stop playing after a short time (and thats saying something because I have a pretty decent tollerance for this stuff).All in all, for 4 bucks I'd say its well worth the money."

Not worth spending any money on. It's nothing new, just a quirky idea with some pretty (and slightly mad) colors splashed in.Hotline Miami without the amazing soundtrack, blood, guts, story, gameplay, or use of the mouse. So, nothing much really. It only retained the obnoxious colors and 80s drenched effects."

,Recommended,272990,13779790,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,"Disc ""LVP"" Rider","This game is insane.Do not play if you are photosensitive or otherwise have trouble with quickly moving images or bright flashing lights.The mechanics in this game are simple: hold spacebar to fill a gauge. Then maybe press ctrl to activate a second gauge and then hold ctrl to fill this gauge.If either gauge fills completely, then you lose a life. If either gauge empties completely, you also lose a life.Keeping gauges close to full awards bonus points, and sometimes bonuses will appear which can only be received by almost emptying the first gauge.Keep playing until a high score.The trick is, this game throws as much visual noise at you as possible to distract you from these goals. It will also invert and scale and wobble and blur the gauges to throw you off.Very rarely does this seem unfair, with the only visually confusing technique I've encountered being changing the background to match the gauge.Overall, it does a very good job of making the gauge levels distinguishable in some fashion, even whilst playing with your eyes and head.It is a very intense visual experience and, as the achievement ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" might suggest, a very intense digital experience.As such I would not play this game for prolonged periods of time, as otherwise you risk damaging your sense of balance and fingers.But, in small doses, this game is remarkably fun.The baby level is creepy though. Maybe don't play that one before bed."

I kept expecting something to happen, but no.. there's zero variety.  And no, I don't care that there's badly clipped videos of cats off of Youtube.Played it for about 10 minutes, and I now have a headache, and my wrist is killing me.   Play this, and you WILL get RSI or have a seizure.  If you like button-mashing, go play Daley Thomson's Decathlon from, like, the 80s. At least it has some variety.Pretentious pap.  UNINSTALLED."

,Recommended,272990,32425112,Posted: 14 June,all,WeeabooJudas,"In spite of the flashy trailers, it's a pretty simple game. Hold space to get the bar as close to full without going over and keep it there as long as possible, do it long enough and it will give you a second bar. This makes it harder, but gives a lot more points. Meanwhile the game itself does basically every visual trick in the book to try and make you fail. It's a psychadelic endurance test with a pretty good sense of humor. That might be worth $4 to you, it was to me.On that note; if you have epilipsy, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME I AM SERIOUS.On another note: In this game about not filling bars, there is an impossible achievement, preventing you from filling the achievement bar. I thought that was clever, but at the time of this writing, there is a 22 page thread filled with people getting impossibly angry at this. The dev themselves couldn't help but make light fun.Maybe THAT is worth $4 to you.It would be to me, but I already bought the game."

,Recommended,272990,11174618,"Posted: 10 July, 2014",all,Nightmare Eyes,"man, steam really, really needs a wobblehand recommendation option.okay, so, since the trailers are pretty dubious and what not, i'll try to make this easy to follow.this game is called gauge. you fill a gauge, you get points for filling the gauge, you get more points for having the gague as full as possible without overfilling it. sometimes a collectible happens, and you must drain the gauge to collect it, which gives you points and the ability to trigger a second gauge for even more points. you start with a point multiplier that increases at set intervals, and it also counts as your lives--run out of lives, and you lose. the entire game is controlled with the space and ctrl keys, and there is no pausing--once you start, you will keep going until you lose/give up.the game makes itself harder by tossing in flashy screens, text, audio cues, stylistic changes, screen-shaking/zooming, and other such distractions to get your focus off the gauge--if you have problems with flashing lights or erratic motions, this isn't a game for you. it's simple enough to pick up, but difficult to master once the distractors start rolling in--they can happen at any time in any combination, so you have to keep on your toes.would i recommend it? depends--it's a fun little time waster, and a neat game for what it is. that said, it's definitely one of those sit-in-a-hospital-lobby-and-watch-your-wait-time-fly-by games, so its value is diminished a bit on steam. still, it's fun, so if ou've got the money and notice it on sale, go ahead and give it a go. i see myself coming back to it pretty often in the near future."

,Recommended,272990,14060947,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,[Opti],"Warning: Do NOT play this game if you have epilepsy of ANY KIND. You WILL get hurt.Gauge is one of those ""How-long-can-you-survive"" games. The controls are simple, hit space bar to expand the gauge and keep it high, but not so high that it touches the sides.Simple right? Not exactly, let's go over this game.Graphics/Style:*Ahem*AUAGHASDHASUDGUASDGAUSGSWEETFUHKCINGJESUSA DYUOFVAVUFYUOAVF*Ahem*The graphics are insane. It starts off looking like an average retro-style game but quickly starts trying to give you a seizure, It's very flashy, colourful and completey nuts.Style-wise this game is great, everything is just so surreal, the game constantly looks like it's being played on an old T.V., Constant real life photos are put into the game, Endless easter eggs (One of which tells you the game is sending your personal info to the NSA.) The gauge occasionally glitches out to distract you and the background is constantly trying to make you wear glasses for the rest of your life.Sound:The Soundtrack is equally insane. It goes from intensly fast glitchy static. To the sound of a photocopier, to insanely fast electronic beats and electric guitar thrown ontop of it. It's pretty entertaining and fits the insane visuals quite nicely.Gameplay:The gameplay to gauge is simple, Survive.Use the spacebar to expand the gauge and keep it at a decent length, but be careful, you can't touch the limits on the side or in the center.To make it harder, as previously stated, the game will try to distract you, a lot. Here is a list of things the game will throw at you.-The gauge will randomly grow to huge sizes-The background will use one of it's many flashy-insane effects-The game will fake glitch out-The game will say things to you in text like, ""THIS IS POINTLESS"" and ""HAVING FUN?""-The limits will grow and shrink forcing you to change the length of your gauge.On top of all this, You will occasionally be able to get a second gauge that you control with CTRL, this will give you double points, but it also doubles the difficulty.In conclusion, Gauge is a great game, It's very stylized, very interesting, and very fun.I reccommending buying it.8/10."
