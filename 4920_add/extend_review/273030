I am a Bath fan and have nothing against Henry, but Louw has been one of the standout players in the World over the past 3 seasons. Cyanide need to develop a database editor or if someone relatively PC literate could have a go it would be awesome.There are also a complete lack of tactical options.

I try not to leave negative reviews in the ""heat of the moment"" so I went away and pondered... here I am many many months later and I feel I simply must post.It is absolutely disgraceful and I feel I have a right as a consumer to be outraged by the fact that this game was promoted and advertised as being fresh and new - the reality is we were all lied to - it's the EXACT same game from 2005 right down to the dodgy sound effects and the intro music, if you explore deep enough in the installation directory there's even references left in that point back to the 2005 folder structure.  Actually I shouldn't say it's the exact same game, it's actually had a lot of stuff REMOVED from the original that made PRM2005 more enjoyable (such as individual 'orders'/options in the 3D gameplay mode.There's nothing at all new about it except the interface (which was actually better 10 years ago), and anything even resembling a new feature appears to have no effect on the game itself as some people have previously mentioned. Perhaps they thought 10 years is a long time and we have all forgotten about PRM2005, either way this game is nothing like it was advertised to be... I really want to say I would give it a chance with mods and patches etc, but the simple fact that we paid in excess of $30 for a game that's a scaled down rehash of a 10 year old framework is unforgivable - I fail to see how they spent any serious time on this at all and therefore something in the $4.99-$9.99 price range and actually advertised properly (as a rehash of PRM2005 and NOT a new game) and I think the negative backlash they are receiving would have been less.Overall - very bad business sense - for a very very bad game"

It seems to me they've just taken a ten year old game, updated the player database (which is often spectacularly wrong aside from the players names) and added some game breaking bugs.The music is exactly the same as PRM2, the game viewed (2D and 3D) seems to be exactly the same as previously, with none of the rule changes over the last decade like time being stopped and playing to 40/80 minutes dead, the defending team having to stand back 5 metres from scrums and not being able to kick the ball out directly if it's been passed back into the 22.In addition to some of the game breaking bugs mentioned in other reviews, other ones i've found are:- Points not being calculated correctly in the league table (how hard is that?)- No European rugby after the first season playing as an Irish province- Substitutions often not working when viewing a matchAll in all I'm slightly gutted by this, I was looking forward to this, but almost no effort whasoever appears to have gone into it.

Like others reviewing this game, I have been waiting a long time for an update to the Pro Rugby Manager series.Unfortunately, this isn't the game that we all hoped it would be.In essence, it is merely PRM 2005 with an updated database and a revamped interface. It is the same game; even the silly quotes that you provide to the  post-match media are exactly as they were 10 years ago.From playing it myself for a few hours, I have discovered a few glitches;1.) Almost every match features a red or yellow card, sometimes four in one match.2.) The player ratings are wide of the mark, as well as some players being assigned to positions they don't play - Leigh Halfpenny is a fly-half apparently.3.) Club Chairman assign you a budget for improvements and transfers that doesn't exist, so if you spend to this budget, you will be fired at the end of the season.4.) Hiring the best staff and upgrading all the facilities doesn't have much influence on the game, especially if you're playing away and want an instant result (simulation.) In some matches you will need to take control via quick 2D match and force your team to finally win by making them follow tactics manually - and this sometimes takes several attempts.5.) Substitutions don't appear to work.Some will know that Cyanide tried to crowd-fund this game last year, but the attempt failed. So I was a little surprised when I stumbled across the virtually whispered promotional material for this game. Now we know the result of this funding failure...... you are buying a new database (which doesn't come with an editor yet.) for a dated game.I can't recommend this game, though I will persevere with it until patches are issued."

You have minimum control over training. The player scores are horrendously wrong. They have some international players playing in the wrong position. You get no control over tactics. Dont have any control over the game. It is very very basic and needs a lot of patching and work to be worth the money. There are fantastic sports manager games out there. This is not one of them. The transfer market is also a joke. Save your money and do not buy this. If the game gets better and fixed I will write a positive review. For now this game seems to be 10 years old and very very basic. They trailers etc were promising but the game has flopped and is a complete disgrace. I want a refund!

I know my experience with the game is limited, but as a Wasps fan I, naturally, decided to play as them. Not only is the squad list wrong, the player stats are also poor. I know I am biased towards my team, but Wade is rated as one out of five stars, Guy Thompson is listed in completely the wrong position - as a back rather than a forward. Many of the stats seem wrong for a lot of players, in some cases making them better than they are and in others, much worse. It is as if they have almost selected them at random. The numerous cases of players not able to play in their positions due to them not being listed to play in them is frustrating to say the least.During play I keep getting told that subs on the bench cannot come back on the field, even if they haven't been used or that certain substitutions cannot be made, which is ridiculous. It also seems that discipline has gone right out of the window as in three games there have been three red cards. Some of the other play seems unrealistic too. Why would a team who is winning at eighty minutes not kick the ball out? Why would they continue to try and score a try, without the chance of a bonus point and risk losing a won game? Why do you get non-penalty restarts after full time?Now my rant is over, I would say that you should only play this game if you don't support rugby, but then, why would you buy it? I have been waiting for an update to this game for ages and was really looking forward to it. The teams inaccuracies are very frustrating and the bugs in the game-play like the substitution issues are really annoying. I doubt I will be playing this game for long, but will give it a shot with a team I don't support, although this is fairly pointless."

There is no editor so you can not change anything yourself.

However, although entertaining and enjoyable this game does have a fair few things wrong with it. From unrealistic player ratings to many bugs which need to be fixed (Unable to make replacements to mauling to outside the stadium). Game needs a bit of work. 3.5/5"

DON'T BUY until the devs actually tell us whether they'll be patching. Want a refund for this amateurish piece of rubbish"

Us loyal Rugby Union fans have been let down by a lack of good games and I can't see that changing any time soon. :-(

Aside from the basic graphics, it fails at a number of simple hurdles - Nothing fancy, nothing complicated, just the basics. For example, swapping on-pitch player positions mid-game counts as a substitution and prevents later subbing of either player. Managerial careers have no challenge or excitement, games don't build any kind of tension and are mundane to watch, and in the end the game simply lacks in every aspect. Will go searching for my refund immediately."

It's a simple, watch them play and then choose what options to do. The sliders at the bottom appear to do nothing what so ever. There is no 'Manager' skill involved at all. Just need to choose what to do at penalty time.Started a career with Leicester Tigers, fielded a weak team in the Champions Cup against Harlequins, won easily. Then faced them in the next game in the league, with a full strength side I got into their 22 once... gave away a penalty for some unknown reason and lost.Very random, very frustrating and very boring very quickly."

I am happy to support developers who innovate....this is not the case with this game. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!
