Pay to win. Yes its free to play but in order to win, you must pay.. Lots of cash to get supreme weapons. Plus the so called hack shield if a trash. Lots of hackers still manage to breach in the game. Abusers, cancerous player that love to bug, using vulgar words, blockers. Plus the support team either sleeping or just ignoring once sending a ticket. It tooks few months..!! Send some blocker video and hacking video, yet same guy appear everyday like nothing happen. If problem occurs, like now always diconnect from the game for every 10 - 15mins, nothing happen.. The Moderator aint fix that. Some like morale boost tooks 8 months.. Till now not yet fixed! Is this how you guys treat your customer? We spend money for this game to make this game alive, yet the service really sucks AF. If asking me why I still play this game? well just look the pro's (crappy laptop). Thats all.. Rating? 1/10.. ( 1/2 over 10)"

It takes 1.6 and adds a few new maps, and a few new weapons, and other minor additionsThe real reason to play this game is because of the extra modes. Zombie Chase, Giant Zombie, etc. are modes only available in this Counter-Strike, and all provide good fun."

,Recommended,273110,29482030,Posted: 25 January,all,Vic,"6 years after its release, Nexon's free-to-play MMO Counter-Strike spin-off has finally been released in the West as Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies. And aside from its pay-to-win aspects, which are pretty problematic for players who can't spend a lot of money in-game... it's actually a lot of fun. There's a great offering of maps and game modes, a lot of stuff to do and a lot of gear to collect. Gameplay-wise, it feels close to 1.6, which is a nice surprise.It's an interesting spin on the Counter-Strike formula, very different from what Valve has done (and not necessarily in a bad way), and which can offer a surprising amount of entertainment. I do recommend it - it is free-to-play and has a populated and active playerbase. Give it a try!"

,Not Recommended,273110,30075548,Posted: 21 February,all,DezRex,"I used to slightly enjoy this game, but I learned a few things about this game.First off, the Pay 2 Win aspect. Sure, you can get every weapon in the game when playing for 5 years straight! Cool! Although, as said, it takes way too long to get it, so why not pay? My motto: ""If you're too lazy, pay for it."". Pay 2 win is like paying to lucid dream or to have a decent time.The 2nd aspect that I hate is the stun. Everytime you get hit, you get stunned, making Assault Rifles and Sub-machine guns extremely over-powered. If you want to use a Shotgun or a Sniper, you're screwed by every one of those users.I honestly just hate this damn game."

The amount of weapons added in in this game... ugh.. it just bothers me. Why is Team Deathmatch added into this? I thought it was just about zombies. Why would you even want to play TDM in this? There are so many weapons and that makes TDM really boring. Zombie Escape is the only fun i still have on this game, but that only has 2 good maps.

BECAUSE THERE IS A FRICKEN REVOLVER SNIPER WITH %100 ACCURACY THAT WILL REKT THE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥OUTTA YOU!!If you are a competitive trying to show off your skills with the classic weapons don't even bother with it. Sometimes if you are lucky you will join a TDM where all people respect the old CS and use only classic weapons........that is untill they start losing and switch to the OP Nexon weapons that have %100 accuracy with a pinch of insta death. Pretty much if some one has the powerful weapons in the game they will destroy your a.nus and hand it to you. I won't even begin to talk about the power of the melee weapons. Let's just say you might aswell just be afk while being slaughtered by a one hit hammer or sword that throws lightning bolts. Maps are one sided as the T p.uss.ies will force the CT's into their spawn like a mouse in a cage and constatly kill you till the game ends. This is due to the maps of CS 1.6 being based on the CT's camping to protect the bomb sites and for the T's to stratecically(<does not exist in this game) find a way to plant the bomb. Again the Nexon weapons play a big role in this unbalance as you never know what the other team could be packing. This is mostly going over TDM which I talk about because most weapons from decoders are meant for TDM or DM.Zombies?? Oh yes thats what this game is about right? No. Again Nexon weapons are over powered and if some pr.i.ck joins the game with them, its all over. I'm looking at you DRILL GUNNERS!! As a zombie you have a chance of winning,if and only if your team decides to work together. This is only the case on some maps though which are mostly maps from CS 1.6. The maps made for mutation mode are built for campers and zombies might aswell give up as people hide in vents or simply use their power weapons. Senario modes are pretty much what you hear from other comments. Rambo shooting never stops till the game is over,so play some music,mute the game and go insane as you shoot a never ending wave of zombies,boxes with more life than i ever will have and a boss that would take you years to kill(If you play on Hard 1 and up). There are some fun modes which are worth the time,but not many people play them which makes you wonder why they even exist.Now let's rap this up by talking about decoders and unlocking weapons. The game, simply put lures you into thinking getting weapons is easy and there's no worry about them expiring. At first you get decoders from logging in on certain days. The guns are nice and kill with ease. You also can craft guns which in the beginning the game makes it seem like crafting has no failure rate at all. Then you start to rank up.....this is where it takes a U-turn on you. You still get decoders,but you start getting the worse weapons that look good,but don't compare with the other Nexon guns or even the original weapons. No problem because you can still CRAFT WEapons... oh it failed to craft? Never happened before. Maybe i'll try again. Another failure? Shoot, well I have plenty of gears,but not enough blueprints. I'm a lucky person...I'll try my luck..and they're all gone.. The game forces you to buy decoders as they are a sure way to get weapons everytime,but not the ones you want. Getting decoders,gears and blueprints in game is almost impossible to get. Let's say you do spend money on decoders. You will get weapons,but they will expire. I would also like to add that buying a decoder doesn't garantee you will get a good weapon. Maybe you get lucky and get a permanent powerful Nexon weapon. You will realize how pointless it is to play as you kill countless souls and make people rage till they die trying to kill you. You will begin to feel like you are good at the game,but just hope that gun doesn't have an expiration date cause when it expires you will have NOTHING!!"
