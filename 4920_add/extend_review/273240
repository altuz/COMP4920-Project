The ability to customize your mech with different weapons and even change the color scheme is also a nice feature to have even though I have not unlocked any new stuff they do give you a couple things to start with.I will say that the only negative I can think of at the moment would be that the zero gravity missions have a very wonky feel to them as I have a hard time aiming and not spinning but this is most likely due to me not having enough practice with the controls.So if you are a fan of old retro side scrolling mech games I think this game will fit the bill as I have not seen anything like this since the old SNES days."

By the time Ifinallyfound a configuration that worked for me and had sufficient time to get used to it... the game was over; just when I thought it was gaining steam. If the game was much longer or had more content, then the fumbly controls would be a non-issue. But as it stands, the control_weirdness:gameplay ratio is not worth it.Another issue are the unskippable cutscenes & dialog. The game isn't long enough to really warrant the mostly-mediocre story shoehorned into it, and does nothing but add frustration if you have to replay a part over and over. And since Gunhound is a Japanese game, it's more-so unforgiving than it is difficult, so you will find yourself restarting quite a bit in order to experiment and learn patterns. There's also a Mission mode that completely skips cutscenes & dialog, but nobody is going to use that mode on their first run.The tutorial trials are also not very useful nor fun. They suffer from unskippable dialog, and they themselves are unforgiving, mostly-nullifying the entire point of them. If you want to learn the controls, my advice is to just walk around for a bit in the first tutorial and mess-around until you're comfortable - then go and play the campaign. Oh, and map Sprint to right-bumper if you're using a 360 controller.The normal price is $17 CDN. That is way,waytoo much for what you may get out of it, and I feel like I didn't get my money's worth for $3.With all that, I had a good time with Gunhound, and am glad I played it - but it's not something I can really recommend for the reasons above."

There is also a time-based scoring system that greatly boosts the replay value of the game.

If you ever liked a mech platform shooter tittle in your life, you owe it to yourself to pick up this tittle. For that matter if you've ever enjoyed any kind of platform shooter in your life, you're likely going to really enjoy this game and find a love for mechs.As well, those of you just rolled out of the anime conventions like Otakon, and want to see an anime type story unfold, the more realistic types using decent psudo science, not screaming for five epesodes type, this is a platformer shooter with a very anime style background, and an unfolding story that you would expect from the likes.Take a machine, avoid incoming fire, flutter the engines to masterfully not have to rely on the suspension alone for all the more grace as you get chop lifted and dropped into jungles, make your way down mountainous hills, and take up arms in another mechonizec war worthy of the kind of vibes you felt watching things like 08th Team, and endure the dangerious with your story granted comrades.The only way this could be better, and I'm hoping someone really watches when I say this, is if someone took these suspension stomping, engine flaring, war environment changing like platformers and started giving them too us with co op play options.Only Metal Warriors was ever two players that I can remember and it was vs. Whatever company starts delivering mech tittles like these and let people form their squads, maybe even community level editors or periodic epesodic levels and missions being dropped for people to play, it's going to be a company with some good sales.Either way, mechs are back, and this is a great tittle to grab to celebrate it.When it comes to gorilla warfare in mechs, and you got a chopper to drop you off where you need to start operations, you already have a good vibe for what you're in for.No brush to tough, we dive at 5.A 5, out of 5."

It's very much like an hybrid between the Assault Suit games and Wolf Fang (a.k.a. ""Rohga: Armor Force"" outside of Japan, an arcade game by Data East, check it out.) It's basically a run-and-gun mixed with a shooter in which you destroy as much stuff as you can and as fast as possible in a mech loaded with powerful weaponry. Just rush missions and destroy tons of baddies, it's as simple as this.Music is scored by Hyakutaro Tsukimo famous for his works on the last games of the Thunder Force series by Tecnosoft, and the art is very 90's-like with gorgeous details.The character design is decent in my opinion, and the japanese voice acting is spot-on. However, being a straight port of the PSP version, it doesn't have high-def graphics or audio, which I can totally live with. The controls are top notch too, but hard to apprehend, you definitely need a joystick for this one.Overall this game screams quality, which is amazing considering it started as a mere doujin. If you're a shooter/STG fan, enjoy mechs and big splosions with fierce head-banging music and lots of pew pew, or just kawaii uguu animay, this game is for you."
,Recommended,273240,23162745,"Posted: 23 May, 2016",all,Diebuster,"Off the top of my head, I can't think of a better example of the Steam userbase downrating a game because they're complete garbage at it. I've yet to complete it from beginning to end using one continue, but I've beaten the final boss using keybard controls and the only thing I had a bit of trouble with was locking on to a direction and using secondary fire at the same time; even that, though, becomes easy once you've practiced enough.Gunhound is a sidescroller with actual physics, and you're controlling a mech that's meant to feel heavy. That's it; that's what the ""irredeemable horribleness"" of the controls boils down to. As soon as you realize that you're not supposed to play this as if it were Mario or Megaman, it stops being an issue.Presentation's not amazing, but totally fine. The music's fitting enough and the graphics get the job done. Most of the mechs are made of smaller sprites put together and spun around in a Mode 7-esque way, which can be an issue and feel unnaturally robotic in games featuring organic characters but is totally fine in a mecha-piloting game.The silly anime story didn't amuse me as much as the one in Astebreed, but it's certainly easier to keep track of what's being said during gameplay given you can actually stop in your tracks in this game. Bonus points for a fairly likable female protagonist."

,Recommended,273240,29818572,Posted: 9 February,all,AmethystViper,"If Assault Suits Valken (a.k.a. Cybernator outside of Japan) was remade into a fast-paced run-and-gun game, it's name would be Armored Hunter Gunhound EX. Originally released as doujin PC game in 2009 (without the ""EX"" in the title), it takes inspiration from NCS's side-scrolling mecha game and mixes in some arcade-styled gameplay reminiscent of Metal Slug or Contra. It was then ported to the PlayStation Portable in 2013 with the help of G.rev (the same developers of Senko no Ronde, Strania -The Stella Machina-, and Border Down), featuring updated graphics, a new soundtrack, more weapons, and a re-telling of the original game's story; owners of the original PC game are able to upgrade to the EX version with a special patch. Both the original and PSP versions of Gunhound were never localized up until this port.In Gunhound EX, you play as Juliane Yuri of the 9th Division Armored Hunter Unit, known by her enemies as ""Lady of Zettai Ryouiki"", as she pilots the titular mecha to shoot stuff up and score as much points as possible like in arcade shooters of old, but there's more to it than that. There is a story, although I couldn't get into it but I'll save the details for later. Contrast to the slower-paced and methodical gameplay of Astro Port's Gigantic Army, Gunhound EX's time attack-styled gameplay encourages you to act and shoot quickly throughout the game's 5+ stages, and if the timer reaches zero, you won't be able to score points for the remainder of the stage, however you can't be reckless unless you prefer seeing the Game Over screen. The game encourages players to refine their piloting skills if they want to rack up the most points and bonuses possible, and doing so can net you new weapons to play around with quicker. Speaking of weapons, there's a bunch to collect in Gunhound EX that can suit your play style, ranging from machine guns, a shotgun, a flamethrower, homing missiles, anti-air cannons, and much more.The game definitely feels like a successor to Assault Suits Leynos 2 in terms of aesthetics; visuals definitely feels like it came from the PlayStation or Sega Saturn era with its low-res but eye-pleasing pixel-art graphics along with some nice parallax scrolling backgrounds and sprite rotation, all while running at a slick frame-rate. Unlike Gigantic Army's bleak and desolate setting, Gunhound EX is a tad more colorful with some nicely detailed mecha designs that makes the setting of the game believable. Although that isn't to say that Gigantic Army is a bad-looking game any means since that game looks great with its SNES-styled visuals. Widescreen support is also much better than the original version. The game also has a rockin' and bombastic soundtrack that adds to the game's fast-paced nature with some pretty good voice-overs for the dialogue that takes place before and during missions. Controls for this game are rock solid... on controller, at least, but I'll get to that in a bit. Everything feels tactile, responsive, and it really makes you feel like you're controlling a big ol' battle mecha. It feels very rewarding when you're able to take down your enemies with finesse and skill because of the game's smooth controls. There are also tutorials that does an okay job of teaching you the ropes of playing the game. The game also has a nice way of switching up gameplay from time-to-time with a decent escort mission and shoot 'em up-styled sections to keep things from feeling stale.So what do I have wrong with this game? Well, for starters — keyboard controls, don't even bother. The keyboard controls for this game are very awkward to work with and there's no way to rebind them natively. Now I've played my fair share of Japanese PC games with keyboard and many of them didn't give players a cumbersome control layout, and if they did they'd at least give you the option to rebind the keys (some better than others). Not the case with Gunhound EX. So unfortunately, a controller is almost required for this game for all the wrong reasons unless you know your way around AutoHotkey. The anti-aliasing option doesn't work at all for whatever reason, so for those that want to smooth out the graphics, you're bummed until they decide to fix it.The English localization really needs some re-tooling. Part of the reason why I couldn't get into the story is due to how mediocre the translation quality of the game is. Some of the menu options aren't very clear on what they do or badly phrased when it was being translated from Japanese (e.g. the description of the original armor purge command from the PSP version doesn't tell you what the original command is unless you looked at the online manual or what the option itself does), typos and errors (e.g. Sophia's name being misspelled as ""Sofia"" at least twice, ""Just like [we] planned!"" in Mission 3, ""[,] Has anyone beaten his simulation before?"" after clearing the advanced section of Lesson 5), and in a rare case, a piece of leftover untranslated text (found in Lesson 6 after destroying all of the helicopters). Some of the written dialogue could use some revising some of it don't have a lot weight to make them very convincing. The English online strategy guide for the game is also botched on any browser that isn't Internet Explorer. The guide and manual also suffers from the lackluster translation quality of the game itself. Personally, I think it would have been better if the guide and manual were made into their own HTML document should anything happen to the developer's website. There's a neat little app you can download for your smartphone (if you have iOS and Android) that will stream in-game dialogue to your smartphone, but sadly it's not released outside of Japan unless you can figure you way around Moonspeak to get it.I've also noticed some graphical oddities and some of the weapons either had no sound effects or a sprite but could be due this game being a port of a port. Although these visual and audio problem aren't exactly game-breaking but probably should be looked at, however I and another player however did came across some game-breaking bugs where the final boss would pull players with its magnetic force to pull players from any distance when firing certain weapons when it's not supposed to happen and kill them instantly. It's also quite bizarre the shield-wielding goon can withstand penetrating weapons like a powerful laser cannon that rip the final boss into shreds but can't withstand a punch from your basic melee weapon. Weapon balance should have been better; the 35mm Anti-Air Cannon has no cooldown period for some reason, it can do a moderate amount of damage over time, and it's one of earlier weapons you can unlock, while the grenade weapons and the Clutch Fang feel completely useless compared to the other weapons that does what they do better. Harder difficulty levels would have been nice too for those looking for an extra challenge from the game, as well as an option to play through the main game without the story interrupting the gameplay akin to RosenkreuzStilette's Arcade Mode.Gunhound EX is a fun game with tight controls (unless you're dealing the awkward keyboard setup), old-school presentation, and will probably keep you coming back to get a high score, but the porting and localization effort really should have been better. If you're still on the fence of forking over $15 for this one unless it goes on sale, there is a demo available from the developer's website, however it's in Japanese but hopefully shouldn't be to hard to figure your way around the menus."

If you don't like BOTH of those things, you'll probably find pretty much nothing to enjoy in this game.This game's weaknesses are easier to describe than its strengths. Its graphics are dated, having been made for the PSP years ago. It's a very transparently low-budget game (with remarkable ugly menus). It's an extremely barebones port with almost no PC-specific features or enhancements. It's singleplayer-only with limited replay value (achieve high scores to unlock extra weapons). It's also short, at about 3 hours from start to finish.Lastly, the controls can be a pain, literally. The game's more difficult fights can require you to juggle between pressing, holding, and possibly double-tapping upwards of 6 different buttons on a controller as you dodge enemy projectiles, fire multiple weapons, jump, dash, and block. Sometimes you even have to do this in zero-gravity where you hold a button to toggle your directional controls between lateral motion (movement) and angular rotation (aiming). I typically couldn't play for more than about an hour at a time before stopping because my hands were aching so much from the finger acrobatics.In spite of all of that, I found the game had old-fashioned charm and was quite satisfying to overcome as a challenge. Like any good Japanese action game, you can feel your mastery of the game steadily increase as you play it. Persistence, pattern recognition, and plenty of patience are required to succeed. I approached this obscure little game with no, or maybe even negative, expectations, so I am surprised and satisfied at having ultimately enjoyed it modestly."

It took me a bit to the more realistic feel of the Gunhound but once you get the hang of it it's enjoyable. There is 5 missions and to unlock all the weapons you have to basically grind points on the 5 missions that are available. The problem with the controls inherently are the fact they are very deliberate, if you try to play it like Mega Man or Metal Slug you will get shot down easily. It doesn't help that the game is kind of trial and error as there are many cases in the game where your hound won't be able to react fast enough to what happens because of it's very deliberate movement. You can purge your armor to increase your speed but it makes you brittle, that's the pay off. There is an odd popping noise in the sound as well, however the game has some good Japanese Voice acting which I think explains the price. That said the songs in the game are very damn good. I got it for 3 dollars on a sale and I got my money's worth however I can't recommend it at its 15 dollar normal price on Steam.Then there is all the little things. There is no graphic options for one, outside of 60FPS control really. Fullscreen is enabled by the old standby, Alt + Enter just in case you didn't know that. Then there is the fact that you have to mash through cutscenes that you can't skip. If you keep dying it gets really old.The game is not horrible, or bad or broken (at least not for me, I see people are having launch and controller issues on the forums.), but there is a combination of things that kind of hinder it. Get on sale in my opinion, at about 7 USD or less. As a mech fan it really does bug me to say that I don't like the complete package but that's the way it played out."

Unlockable weapons and one credit play are actually rewarding in a game that feels like this one.  It's pretty fast but feels weighty and even if it could use some more levels it has a good spread of what the levels entail.

Has a lot of positives, though they are tempered by the negatives. I'll explain below.-For those of you who want to use a controller, you'll need to set it up in options first, but otherwise it works just fine with most controllers. I personally use a dualshock3 with a USB attachment.-Gameplay is responsive, difficulty is decent but not overbearing (I recommend the simulator since you'll need the training beforehand). Please keep in mind that if you're a real go-getter and you don't take things slowly, you'll find yourself beating this game in a matter of hours.-The story is not that good, it's not bad, but let me save you some time and recommend skipping them wherever possible. I forget if there even is a button to skip them.-graphically it's very nice. Spritework is almost top notch, and you won't get that taste of ""8 bit retro hipster"" in your mouth. However it's a little confusing sometimes since the sprites can often leave you dazed and they'll group together, but in most of the missions you can tell what you're firing at and what's firing at you.-the OST is okay, nothing to speak home aboutOkay, so I have to be blatantly honest here. There is one huge negative.-the mech customization is actually pretty bad. Without spoiling the game, the unlock system requires blatant ingame grinding, and since the game is so short, you'll just be grinding one mission over and over again to rack up the points. To put it in perspective, the very most points you can get in a mission is 500k, and you need at least 3 million to unlock your first weapon. To get everything, you need 100 million. It's a very awkward design flaw. You do unlock some stuff while playing through the game, but it's very limited and you won't notice much difference.Overall, as a robot enthusiast, I would recommend this game, but under the pretense that you get it on sale. If you want my honest opinion, the game could still use some improvements, but you get what you pay for at least. Don't go in expecting a timeless masterpiece."

More editing and punch-up writing on the part of the translator(s) would've defnitely smoothed things out, but since the story isn't a major part of the gameplay, it's forgiveable."

,Not Recommended,273240,16066676,"Posted: 29 May, 2015",all,Uncle Lyall,"This game no doubt has the potential to be something worth playing, but sadly it has numerous minor faults that stack up to make a wholly dissatisfying and frustrating experience. These are some of the problems I have faced with this game.The mech you have to pilot is, for the most part, clunky, which results in a game that is no longer challenging but simply frustrating. The enemies will often bombard you with bullets, sometimes filling the screen, which would be a fun a challenge if your mech could actually move fast enough to avoid them. The maneuverability of your mobile suit leaves a lot to be desired and the awkward controls wouldn't be such an issue if the enemies and obstacles were carefully planned around these deficiencies. Unfortunately, they are not, which resulted in me dying countless times. If it's not the speed that's the problem, sometimes it's not visually obvious whether or not something on screen will actually damage you. Sometimes the smoke from explosions (mostly cause by your own bullets) obscures the stuff that will actually kill you, giving you no time to respond when it becomes visible. Other times the ""bullets"" themselves aren't distinct enough to provide a visual cue that they need to be avoided. Sometimes it's both, and more often than not there's so much happening on screen that it's a headache to even process it all. This wouldn't be such a problem if you could move fast enough to deal with it.While the mech's movement is painfully slow in the standard levels, at the other end of the spectrum are the zero-g levels, which are frustrating because there is simply too much movement. Every time you move your mech it starts to spin, which can be overcome by holding the ""fixed angle button"", which locks where you're facing at that given moment. This is fine when you only have to shoot things coming from the right, as you can just jam the button down and move freely while shooting in a single direction. If you have to shoot up or down then it quickly becomes a mess because simply trying to get yourself to face the right way is counter-intuitive, and if the level happens to automatically scroll (as some of them do) chances are you'll be crushed by a wall before you manage to correct your position. If the enemies don't kill you, chances are the level will.In most run and gun games, the screen either scrolls automatically or moves with the player. In Gunhound, facing the other way causes the visual area to shift, which sounds useful in theory but proves annoying in practice when merely trying to run backwards to avoid enemy fire causes you to lose sight of the very thing you're trying to keep tabs on.Something as simple as jumping isn't as straightforward as it should be, either. You have booster packs which have a delayed start, which makes it pointlessly difficult to time your jumps in order dodge the incoming barrage of bullets, lasers and missiles the game frequently throws at you. Sometimes the bullets are so big or so frequent, jumping them is pointless because the limited boost capabilities mean you just fall back into the line of fire. The developers have probably attempted to add an element of realism by making the Gunhound have to work against gravity so much, but it just adds to the frustration of gaming experience.It's also possible to glide along the floor using the booster, but if you jump to avoid an obstacle, when you land the shock absorbers kick in which momentarily delays your movement, which completely throws off the timing of any subsequent jumps and therefore ruins the fluidity of motion that boosting ought to give you. Furthermore, the apparent weight of the mech and the slow boosting makes the flying levels hell on earth. Holding the boosters (eventually) shoots you to the top of the screen, while letting go of the boosters for more than a split-second will cause you to plummet to your death as you fall faster than the boosters can fully activate.I'm all for games that require good reflexes to win, but, for me at least, the timing required for some parts of the game is beyond what is physically possible. For example, airborne enemies will swoop in, fire a missile and leave the screen before you even have time to react and shoot them down. Generally, there's a disconnect between what is needed to win and what you are given. The game demands speed as the various enemies and obstacles require nimble movement to be overcome, but what you're given simply doesn't meet that requirement.I love run and gun games like Metal Slug and I love mecha, but this game falls short in so many ways.Get it in the sale if you're really curious but for the most part you're not really missing out."
