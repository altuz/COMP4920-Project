I made it to day 27 (12th place on the leaderboards for kicks) before I gave up. Once you get a powerful enough weapon, you can just stand there and hold the mouse button while using your other hand to feed your mouth with chips.I can see this game getting a lot better, but:Nays (as of now):- I found very little use for most of the weapons, there's a lot, but you'll probably never use them.- Items that give you temporary stat bonuses don't last long enough/aren't very interesting, I couldn't justify picking them up.- Block placement is fun, but I never seemed to be able to collect enough resources to build more than 8 blocks at a time.- Music starts to get annoying, it's not a bad track, I just wish there was more than NUNUNUNUneeeNUNUeeeeeNUNU...- You can't be bothered to look at the UI early on, it's very small and should be more noticeable.- The cursor/crosshair is also difficult to spot, I never know where it is after blinking.Yays:- The A.I works very well, I can see there is some AGGRO involved.- Bullets don't simply go straight, there's some realism.- Hit testing is spot on for walls/structures.- Various mobs, the game is not limited to zombies.- I don't regret paying $4 for this.Basically, this is Bird's Eye Serious Sam, but the weapons will eventually need some major balancing.Wants:- Map Maker, especially for a tile-based game like this.- More items: fences, mines, det-bombs, bla bla.- Bosses, bosses that don't like it when I spend that past 3 hours camping in my 7x7 structure.- Leveling and more stats...

Well,Over 9000 Zombies!brings many things to the table - over 9000 different helpings in fact (just kidding).---------------------------------------------------------Through a retro styled theme,Over 9000 Zombies!does what many other zombie survival games can't. It brings thrills and fun into the realm of an already bloated genre that verge on impossible, annoying, complex, or expensive. For the low low price of $1,49, and for a two-pack no less, you will most certainly be entertained for long periods of time. Take a step back into the late 1990s. Experience gaming through its purest lens. This is honestly a great little title that you can play with any friend.Don't let the term ""zombie survival"" and ""low price"" detract you from picking up this game, however. Where games like7 Days to DieandLeft 4 Dead 2are more prominent and come to mind, this game - of course - doesn't compare. What it has, though, definitely makes up for what it lacks. There is a huge amount of content that is offered: a vast amount of options in terms of guns and turrets. Various enemies that you have to adapt to; many maps as well. Strategising comes down to a ""T"" if you really want to master the game and get all the achievements.There is also a Leaderboard, where the best players have survived over 300+ nights. Challenge yourself in this aspect and, in the end, see why this game will give you all the bang for your buck.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Custom maps!+ Day and night cycle+ Leaderboard challenges!+ Various maps to choose from+ The soundtracks actually aren't that bad+ You can't go wrong with a retro styled game+ Shoot, shoot, and shoot - that's all there is to it+ Achievements and trading cards are always a bonus+ Good soudtrack that doesn't take away from quality of game+ Simple graphics and sounds effects makes for great gameplay+ Multiplayer option offers even more fun with friends at a cheap cost+ Very straightforward, no tricks or gimmicks when it comes to a zombie survival game+ Easy on the computer; hardly any lag despite there being tons of things going on at once+ Ability to come back into the game as long as your friends survive (MP). It isn't too easy where you aren't punished, however - if you die, you have time added on to your spawn time, so it is both forgiving and punishing+ Huge collection of weapons to upgrade, customise, or utilise; for such a cheap game, you would think that your options would be more limited, but no.Over 9000 Zombies!truly impresses with the amount of content offeredCons- No pause button; you'll have to survive however long you can in one continuous sit-down- I'm not sure if this is the cause at all, but for some reason the person who joins a game doesn't get ""special achievements"" unlocked. I have killed over 1000 crows, eyes, etc. for sure, yet haven't unlocked any of those. I have also killed the bosses numerous of times and have yet to unlock them as well. I believe the host is the only way capable of unlocking said things. If anyone can confirm or deny, that would be great!---------------------------------------------------------Honestly,Over 9000 Zombies!comes at a time when one needs a break from similar games. It is a simple yet charming contender that doesn't ask for much. As of the time of this writing, I would highly suggest that you get this game if you're interested in playing a casual and, overall, relaxing zombie survival game.Overall9/10---------------------------------------------------------"

They did well with this.There is a large amount of guns, maybe like 20ish.  Some of them do operate very similarly though.There is a map editor option but all that really does it change the cosmetics (which are limited), not the strategy.Overall, the game had some good features, played smoothly, was co-op, guns/turret selection was plentiful, and you get to murder lots and lots of zombies.However, my brother and I completely unlocked everything and did everything the game had to offer on our first try.  The replay value is literally just replaying the same thing.For the bundle price of $1.49 I can TOTALLY recommend it.  $9.99 is where my negative review comes in."

Weapons, turrets, walls, thousands of zombies to kill, an expansive map, far surpassing it's predecessor.But unlike EZR,this game never stops.In EZR, you got a breather. A chance to go to the store, go to bed or go back fighting, but it was a break in the day.In Over 9,000 zombies, your only solace is death.

This ""Zombie"" game is just as fun, intense, and exciting as a lot of other ""Zombie"" games.First off, there are plenty of Zombies to shoot, so the title fits the game very well. Although you may think that it would be difficult to play with when you have hordes of zombies coming after you, but it's not that hard.Along with the zombies, you can upgrade yourself with new weapons, turrents, and even upgrade your character to do more damage, get more health, or to increase your item finding chances as you progress through the days. The longer you last, the more upgrades you get.This game is just plain fun as well as exciting.

Crazy amounts of enemies, top down style, cool guns and lots of replayability. I also remember wishing in those days I could also create my own levels in the game, since it seemed really basic even at the time the game came out...I see this game on sale and decided to take a look, and I was floored. Everything came rushing back to me as if I was a little kid again, intensely staring at an arcade machine with sweaty palms and shaking knees. Dry mouth from being frustrated and 100 percent satisfied with what I had going for me at the moment. The fast-paced decision making and lucky gambits started flowing through my hands; my mind felt like it was on fire.After I get destroyed a few times in the early days I really get the hang of the defense systems in the game, and just go berserk. It seemed like the hordes were melting in front of my wall of turrets, iron defenses led to sharp counter-attacks and remarkable saves. Days flew by it seemed and the weapon upgrades just kept coming. I felt like I had finally returned to my gaming roots...and it felt good.10/10 - Would forget what time was again."
,Not Recommended,273500,30616152,Posted: 19 March,all,ActionPoohole,"The duration of how long you can survive is far beyond the entertainment that the game provides for that duration.The problem isn't the lack of content, it's how the game is executed.To begin, i'll just say that there is (some) entertainment to be had. But if you think that you're going to get $10 worth of gameplay, I am here to tell you that it's likely to be false.First games I played I didn't know the control to build turrets and ended up walking around just shooting stuff. I quit before I died on a couple of attempts because I got bored, I thought that there surely must be more than what I was seeing. I came back and checked the controls properly and learned how to build turrets. You can build a max of 6 turrets at a time, but you can build as many walls as you like. Just need a little patience and (PERHAPS) a little luck to get enough scrap metal to build some turrets and some walls...So standing between 2 to 3 layers of walls. Within those walls I had a few rocket turrets and a repair tower to keep them in top top shape. I was just standing there firing my minigun and throwing endless grenades.Every once in a while I would run out the top of the walled enclosure to top up my grenades. The biggest concern wasn't taking damage when I went for the unrequired grenades, not at all. My biggest concern was: How long can I stand here behind this wall and fire my minigun before I get bored?? ...About 10-15 minutes.So the initial 25-30 minute build up was for me to realise I was just going to be standing behind walls shooting at enemies for another 20 minutes and nothing can touch me. A game that allows you to be invincible because of poor design so early isn't worth $9.99 as it was too easily exploited.A game like Risk of Rain gets away with allowing you to exploit it because it introduces ""game mutators"" as such to change how you play the game. As soon as the game was exploitable was when it got boring though.. So the same thing applies, but it WAS a good game.To the sour patch kid ""Westenra"" who wrote:""So because you got lucky in a run the game is automatically bad? Check your attitude. Down-voted""I am allowed to write my experience of a game without having my attitude commented on. If you don't like it then just down vote, but don't comment on my attitude as though I did something wrong.If you're so sour about me not liking the game then down vote my review again, I deleted review to modify it slightly to point out that you have the attitude, not me.The game is somewhat bad in a core aspect because it has a high percentage chance of being instantly exploited to the point of a possible endless farm or at least an hour or two worth of standing behind a wall and clicking on stuff till you quit of boredom or the game actually starts breaking your walls down. I'm not sure when that point comes, if at all, but what was there leading up to this possibility was not that fun after a short amount of time. The game up until that point was ""decent"", but not extremely exciting. It was just a fun little shooter to kill half an hour on.Game is not not worth the asking price of $10.Over 9000 Zombies! is a 99 cent title that should be on sale for 10-50 cents.If you pay $9.99 you are getting heavily ripped off as there isn't nearly enough here to make it feel like anything much better than a FREEWARE title. I really don't understand how they can charge $10 and justify it. The quality of the art alone screams 99 cents.If the game included more than 20 or so guns (Perhaps 50+) and some gameplay mechanics that had more depth and a little less around the basis of a lucky run that can put you into a possible instant win scenario then I would say that $10 would be okay, but it does not.The game is co-op though so that is something that brings this title into the realm of worth charging possibly more than 99 cents for... But only just."

Growing up playing lots of SNES games, for some reason it reminded me of SmashTV and I love that game to death. Aside from having to stay in just one area and fortifying yourself against zombie hoardes, it has that SmashTV feel to it: you kill a whole bunch of things and collect useful items. The only major difference is instead of toasters, microwaves and money you're collecting scrap metal and grenades to survive the massive amounts of zombies.Overall I really recommend this game. It has that feeling of a throwback while also capturing some elements relevent to modern games, especially the ever growing zombie survival genre. Don't be fooled by its pixel graphics either - to me that's probably one of the most enjoyable aspects of this game, and they're really well done in a way that's both enjoyable but also nostalgic.As a side note, it's just a great damn game to run around and bust up some zombie♥♥♥♥♥"

I certainly hope that one day this game will offer a 4 player option instead of just 2; sadly, I had some friends buy this and we ended up playing individual games instead of a 4 player game as one.Still, this game is totally worth the $0.99 price tag (The price on sale for 90% off). Not sure I would spend $9.99 for it.Hope this helps."

In this point the game is an scam.Otherwise the game is genius, I bought it for about 1$ and it is really nice to play, but the regular price is too much for it. I would pay maximum 5$ for it, maybe little bit less.Overall there should be more updates and more turrets/items/weapons/ideas addet to the game over the time AND the multiplayer should be overworked so there will be a REAL Multiplayer (""Multi"" means for me more than 2 in general, i think for the most player too)"

This game is a great little hybrid of a twin stick shooter and tower/hoard defense. I was definitely mildly surprised at how much fun I actually had with this poorly named game.In every aspect 9K Zombies is a simple game. The top down perspective allows for basic graphics, though things are easy enough to identify.  Objective wise things are also elementary; successive hordes of zombies spawn ever day/night cycle and it's up to you to blast them away using weapons that unlock as you progress as well as turrets/defenses you can build. Zombies drop grenades, health, and most importantly: scrap. The scrap is used to build turrets to help keep the Zs at bey. There are quite a few different ones to build and they have unique effects (Grenade Launcher, Flamethrower, Laser, Lightning, etc.).All in all this game is quite fun, especially for being a simple game in 3 played out genres (zombies, twin stick, hoard/tower defense). My one main complaint is that the top down perspective + the crude graphics make telling the difference between a wall and the ground difficult in a few places.  This doesn't happen all the time so it doesn't impact the enjoyment for me. I've really been enjoying playing this game. For the normal $9.99 price definitely pass, it’s WAY too much money. Stick it on your wishlist and when it's on sale for $0.99 then absolutely grab it. While this game is good, and I enjoyed it, it’s not worth anything more that $1.99 imo."

It was fun at first but there is absolutely no replay value. All of the maps are essentially the same, some of the more complex ones simply feeling claustrophobic. They're all fairly boring. The game is pretty broken after you play it for a bit, and the difficulty really stops increasing after a while. Once you're all set up you'll live for as long as you want. We had six turrets set up and ended up just alt tabbing and idling to see how far it would get us after a while. Quite a few bugs and glitches, it doesn't seem like they did much testing with this... It's really unbeliavable to me that this is what passes as a $10 game, you can easily find far better games than this on New Grounds or any other flash game site for free. I respect the effort put in to this by the devs, but I really feel that this isn't deserving of the price, or the praise. It might be worth it on sale, but even that is a generous statement. There's a ton more I could say about this but it would just sound like a laundry list of digs. Better luck to the studio in the future."

Great weapon progression, challenging waves, and Steam workshop.But even after all the guns and blood, the best part is still the feature where the zombies chew through walls. Makes the map much more fun, especially on the later waves when there are hordes outside your house.Has a few bugs in 4-player split screen, but well worth your time.I would try to get it on sale though, as it can go for cheap."

Also the dubstep music throughout fits so well.   It's not pretty, but once you get addicted it doesn't matter... it's beautiful.   Nice game, love it, looking forward to getting the 900,000 achievement one day.   Woot!"

I got this on sale for a whopping 99 cents, and wasn't expecting much. What I got was a fun and addicting little game.This game will NOT be for everyone. It's an old school top down, very simple, zombie shooter. You start out on a map and simply have to survive wave after wave of increasingly difficult zombies. You pick up powerups from dead zombies, unlock new weapons as you progress, and level up via a simple but nifty little levelling system.This game is for 1 to 4 players, COOP or online. You kind of need a couple of friends if you want to last a long time. I made it to about level 30 playing solo, but there comes a point where there are just too many zombies, and you'll need some backup.It's a very simple game with simple graphics and gameplay, but it's actually good mindless fun. You can get most of the Steam achievements pretty easily, and it does get monotonous (Best when played in short bursts), but for 99 cents, is worth it. It only comes with a few maps, so I would suggest getting some more from the Workshop.All in all? This game isn't for everyone, but I got WAY more than 99 cents worth of fun out of it."

But to my surprise, I found myself still playing it after 3 hours, then I played Co-op with a friend and it was even better! I’ve now played 9 hours and still have fun like it’s the first time playing it. It’s not hard but challenging, so it’s fun to test how much further you can survive and what strategies you can apply to have a better outcome. It’s amazing how much fun I have while fighting zombies."

So far I did not encounter any problems while playing this game. I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in survival games and arcade shooters."

,Recommended,273500,29215862,Posted: 12 January,all,Cmdo.Delta,"Just played 30 minutes.. it's uber fun but I had no clue exactly how to play. After one game, you kinda know what to do. No big learning curves, just pure quick easy fun. For 1 buck, why not? I bought a pack of 2 to play with a friend. Can't wait to mess around with this game for few hours with him. Based on those 30 minutes, I would say that even if I had to pay 5$ for the pack of 2, it wouldn't have been a steal. It's pretty decent and seems bug free.Note that I read somewhere that coop 4 players was for local game only. You can only play 2 players at time over Internet. It's pretty much the only cons of this game."
