However you can download Freespace 2 and install Freespace Open from the Hard-Light Forums. The game now features hundreds of mods, campaigns, and user made ships as well as two separate takes on how the Freespace universe could have progressed after Freespace 2. It is also possible to play with upgraded graphics and at higher resolutions. All that for the amazing price of nothing. It is worth noting that Freespace Open is supported on OS X and Linux Operating Systems as well.Happy fragging!"

,Recommended,273600,10048419,"Posted: 7 May, 2014",all,Swift -Iido's Gaming Den-,"When I saw this had become available on Steam, I was overjoyed. Freespace: The Great War was one of my absolute favorite games as a child, and I believe it still holds up strongly to this day.The game begins 14 years into the war between the Terrans and Vasudans, and before long, an even greater threat shows its face, an ancient and destructive alien race known only as the Shivans...enemy to Terran and Vasudan alike.Freespace: The Great War is a space flight sim. While most missions involve you either protecting an important target, or wiping out enemy forces, oftentimes both, they are all varied in their actual content and no two missions really feel the same. As the game progresses, you gain access to a good variety of different ships, each with varying strengths and weaknesses, as well as an assortment of different weapons.Another of Freespace's strong points is its atmosphere, formed mostly from the music and dialogue. It will make you feel like you ARE the pilot, and a part of the game itself. This is definitely one of the things that helps to set Freespace apart from other space sims. I have never played another space sim that gave quite the same feeling Freespace does.This release includes the expansion, Silent Threat, which continues the story after the main campaign's ending with several additional missions.I really can't recommend this game enough. If you're a fan space flight sims or flight sims in general, and have not played this game, now's your chance to experience a masterpiece."
76561197969749884,Recommended,273600,33180159,Posted: 3 July,all,Sarkoth,"Descent: FreeSpace was - for pretty much two decades - the start of the best space combat simulation ever developed. I probably spent several years of my childhood playing FreeSpace 1 and 2 and to this day there is no other game which I will get back to every few years and then play it for months on end because it is that good.Never before have I played a game which utilizes almost all keyboard buttons, some of them even twice or thrice with button combinations. It takes days to get used to the controls and to remember all of them in the heat of battle, but after having learned them once, I never forgot them again. I can boot up any FreeSpace game after 5 years without having played it and the controls will come back to me within 5 minutes. No other game has ever managed to do that. No other game has ever managed to entertain me to that degree even although I can still remember every single mission, every enemy wave, every plot twist and all and any scripted events.FreeSpace might not be for everyone, but every space-sim fan who doesn't believe FreeSpace to be the best space combat sim ever developed simply either hasn't played it yet or is too young to be able to fully appreciate its actual complexity and depth, as it is perfectly possible to play and even finish the game with just knowing how to thrust, turn and shoot. But there's so much more to those who aren't afraid of delving deeper into the game.To this day, 15 years later, the FreeSpace 2 Open Source Project is still making the game better and every person even remotely interested in the FreeSpace series should check out the several hundred campaigns and total conversions available over at theHard-Light.netFreeSpace community. It's by the way not only one of the most friendly and dedicated gaming communities I have ever seen, it also boasts probably a score of the best coders lurking around on the interwebs as well.I can't just recommend FreeSpace, I would actually have to literally build a physical shrine to be even remotely able to convey how I feel about the entire franchise and its modding community."

You are a recruit pilot who just joined the Galactic Terran Alliance in its age-long war against the Parliamentary Vasudan Empire, but the war takes a different turn when an unknown threat makes its appearance with the sole purpose of exterminating both races.Pros: You get to live the war and the events through the eyes of a pilot, and the whole story is detailed through mission briefings and in-game events. Different levels of success in a mission may affect the following mission, even open entire branching side-missions. The voice acting does a good job a delivering the humane yet rigid tone of a military situation, something you'll rely on for immersion as there is little to no cut scenes. Action is great, and often allows creative thinking to resolve an issue, succeed in a mission and achieve bonus goals. The missions themselves are very varied, rivaling and often surpassing classics of the genre like theWing Commanderseries. Control is spot-on, although optimized for mouse-less keyboard. As you progress, you get more and more flexibility in how you want to set and arm your squads.Cons: The game isn't opened world, but mission-based, so forget any concept of exploring or visiting space stations and planets: you jump in, do the mission, and jump out. The graphics have aged a lot: it isn't retro-style, it's actual pixelated low-resolution interface and texture.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youThe game's graphic aged horribly, but the rest hasn't: sound, music, control, action, everything remained as excellent today as it was back then. I'll recommend this game only to people who enjoys playing classics, andDescent | Freespace: The Great Waris one of the good ones!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)reviews."

As a 12-year-old I was in awe and completely immersed in the experience fighting the unknown, mysterious and deadly Shivans. When it released on Steam a while ago, I instantly bought it and relived that same feeling - albeit with an xbox 360 controller rather than my old joystick - I recommend using a joystick if you have one, the 360 controller lacks precision for this type of game (though not enough to be disruptive).If FreeSpace 2 is the better game, this one opened up the world of space combat sims for me. Looking forward to playing more similar games now that the genre is seemingly becoming more popular again."

,Recommended,273600,12619447,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,Bluehawk,"My all-time favourite space combat game. The gameplay is tight and complex, missions are varied and progress in difficulty smoothly, graphics were amazing in the day (and still are with the Freespace Opensource project and FSPort), and the campaign is well-written and paced, albeit the ""lore"" is sparsely explained without the manual.The release on Steam does not let you control your resolution and personally I get a terrible flicker in menus and briefings, so I would actually recommend Freespace 2 and the Open Source engine, which enables you to play the FS1 campaign as a port/mod, plus a plethora of user-created content like enhanced models with normal and specular mapping, total conversation campaigns etc. Plus, the new engine squashes some old bugs and has built-in post-processing effects. It's the ultimate Freespace experience."

If you grab this, dont forget to pick up FreeSpace 2 aftwards, its on GoG and has a large and active modding compunity that has kept this game up to date both feature and graphics wise.I can only hope to see FS2 get on steam, with the FSOpen mod on official support. Such an action would bring Freespace into the realm of contending with F2P games, as it will be cheap ($15 for base files) then have 5GB of mods slaped on to brin it in line with high end Open GL graphics, and a new matchmaker ands stats browser to replace PXO.

Old school simulator(ish) style gameplay with basically everything done right.  Review will be for both Descent Freespace 1 and Freespace 2.1) Gameplay flight mechanics and controls:  Flight is simplified to mimic atmosphere flight mechanics (Arcade style) but the controls are simulator style.  Power managment, shield distribution, ETC.  Joystick control is reccomended but the mouse can be used as well.2) Story:  In my opinion, THE ABSOLUTE BEST STORY I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN A GAME.  The story is told through Cutscenes, Pre-mission briefings, and sometimes even during your mission.  Oh...and the games intro scene is the best cutscene in any videogame ever.3) Graphics:  Excellent if it were 1998-2000, however now the graphics do not hold a candle to current games.  However a dedicated group of programmers have created the ""Freespace 2 Source Code Project"" AKA ""Freespace 2 SCP"".  Simply explained, this project updates all the graphics to about modern day [2015 (ish)] standards.  In order to use SCP project you must have purchased Freespace 2.  Then the SCP project will allow you to play the following things with the updated graphics:   Freespace 1 (Descent Freespace), Freespace 2, as well as additional fan made campaigns.I could go on and on about the greatness of the Freespace games but let me ask you a simple question instead.  Can you remember the last game you played where the graphics were amazing (now using SCP Project mod), you had no issues or complaints with the controls or game performance, and the story was so amazing that you can remember it 15 years later?  I can, and they are Freespace 1 and Freespace 2 (which i have replayed over 5 times now).Oh, and whatever company has the rights to Freespace, PLEASE make Freespace 3."

The next issue i am getting is that the subsystem targeting on larger ships dose not work if they have multiple weapons,  its supposed to target the main targeting computer then the individual weapons as they are destroyed,  so for capture missions be ready to locate the guns your self and take them out.  other then that its exactly as i remember from when i first had it.The controls do come off a little clunky now as i am used to more smoth controls and its is designed for mainly keyboard play,  the controls are inverted for the mouse and that can not be undone but for the keyboard you can change the key bindings of 8 and 2 on your number pad around to fix the issue.  Though after the first three missions you should have it down on what buttens to press and when.My favorit part of this game is that you can select what ships and weapons for which squad go out in to battle with you or that you pilot which can help make game easier or ungodly hard if you chose the wrong weapon sets.  Also! do look through the keybinding list,  the ingame tutorial will not teach you every thing, just enough that you can get through the game with little issues but the extra commands that are in the game help you so much to play with out them to me is not a very good idea...Other then that, if you wanna be a deepspace protector of earth and lead a squadren of fighters to help you along your way to meet differnt mission goals not as the main character of the story but some one whos effort through these missions help advance a war where two enemys fought for years on end are now being forced to work together to take on a far superior threat, then i recommend this game for you."

Finding this on Steam brought me way back and I finally got to finish The Great War! Sadly, the excitement sort of ended at the demo and the rest of the game is a bit lack luster. I was a big Rouge Squadron fan around the same time so I loved the customization of the ships and weapons as well as directing your wingmen that Rouge Squadron didn't have. The missions lack variety in scope and scenery. You are always in space shooting the same enemies and it get kinda dull. Plus, you can finish missions without even having to touch your ships and weapon layouts and they end too quickly. Some of the missions are a little buggy and the expansion is awful with no clear direction and terrible AI. Needless to say, it hasn't aged well. Haven't played the sequel yet which I hear really good. It's worth a play if you want a good sci-fi story, late 90s nostalgia, or a game to complete over the weekend. Other than that, may want to look at something else."

If someone took the time to build a mini console at startup with some options why not add resolution change? At 2015 1600x900 would be minimum to ask. At the current state my head and eyes hurt as hell and i get this will to vomit after 15 minutes of gameplay. Maybe theres more ppl like me out there. If they change that ill give the tumbs up cuz the problem is NOT the game itself.

My solution:When the FreeSpace Launcher starts, click 'setup' then 'Detect Available Cards' and ensure the 'Primary Display Driver' is selected. Try clicking 'Play FreeSpace' and see if it works. If this doesnt work you will probably have to restart.If it didnt work repeat what you did then bring up 'Task Manager' (control,alt & delete) find 'FreeSpace Launcher' under name.  Right click on it and bring up 'Properties' then click on 'Compatibility' Tab at the top. Tick the box that says 'Run this program in compatibility Mode For:' and select Windows XP (Service Pack 3). Apply the settings and then click 'Play FreeSpace' on the Launcher.For me this worked. If this didnt work then try running the Compatibility Troublshooter.My System:Windows 8.1i5 44308 GB RAMGTX 570___________________________________________________________________________The Basics:This game is a space sim - this means you pilot fighters or bombers in the theatre of space.You CAN play this game with a mouse and keyboard, it will be improved with a joystick or gamepad but its more than playable without.The game purchased on Steam includes the Expansion Pack 'Silent Threat'I believe the game was released in 1998 although the graphics were amazing then they are obviously dated now. However not to the point of hampering my enjoyment.A Classic. The game tells a truly gripping story of a desperate fight for survival. Every story needs a good antagonist and this is no exeption, a mysterious and ruthless enemy await you. What this game really shines at is it makes you feel super involved with intense against the odds battles.New technologies arent just thrown at you theyre introduced intwined with the story and discussed in briefings everything feels like it had reason behind it.The ship designs are nice, if not a little limited by the technology of the time.The Controls are simple and easy to grasp however as i pointed out before will be improved if you have a joystick or gamepad.The mission briefings are great and sound Authentic and the missions themselves offer enough variety and unpredictability to keep your attention. The whole game makes you feel involved & has a great storyline, a definate for the oldies that prefere a riveting story and great gameplay."

You can fly a lot of ships, shoot a lot of guns and missiles, destroy whole fleets of enemies by yourself (well... if you are good enough). Can be pretty relaxing.But, of course, there is some nuances. You have to plan what to take on missions, because a lot will depend on this. And there is flying itself, but you get used to it pretty quickly.Years later, i tried to find something similar (i mean, there are lots of this kind of games), but only succeeded a couple of times.So, yeah, this game is kinda special to me."
