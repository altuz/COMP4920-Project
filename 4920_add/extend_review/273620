If you have any interest in this genre, and you haven't played this game yet, you're missing out on the masterstroke that paved the way for games like Freelancer and EVE Online.If you're having technical issues be sure to check out the Freespace Open project, which attempts to fix some of the bugs and update the graphics and lighting to a level contemporary players may be more comfortable with. For me personally, as-downloaded, my installation of Freespace 2 refused to run properly, but after installing FSO, it executes effortlessly.In the space of a few minutes, you'll find yourself weaving between capital ships, trying to dodge flak, focus-fire on enemy capital weaponry to disarm them, and dog-fighting with customizable ships and loadouts. All the while, a grand narrative is unfolding with plenty of little twists and flavor to keep your interest.Best of luck, pilots."

I bought it back when it first came out, I bought it on Good Old Games and now I've bought it on Steam. Why? I'll tell you why - I believe it's the greatest game ever made.Why this game is awesome and deserves your attention;The original graphics were fantastic back at release in 1999.You won't be using the original graphics when playing the game.The story was - and still is - amazing. Far better than the usual tripe.There's an excellent balance struck between you being an incredible pilot who saves thousands of lives, and you just being a dude in a one-person fighter who can't single-handedly save the day.You play against both rebel humans, and a dark & insidious alien race.Your Shivan opponents don't have Star Trek-style translators. There's no communicating with them or understanding their objectives. They don't fight for territory and they don't act like humans on a different team. They're aliens - and both their ships and their tactics demonstrate that.All too often, the strength of your enemies in games is inconsistent. They march into the beginning of the game with a roar, and then die with a whimper at the end. Or else you're handed a gimmicky win. This doesn't happen here - both your victories and your loses feel justified and fair.You play a variety of roles. You scout hostile territory, battle enemy fighters, protect large capital ships from enemy bombers, destroy large capital ships as a bomber, neutralize the main weapons of enemy destroyers to give your side a fighting chance, protect innocent civillians in transport vessels, hunt down a traitor and more. Look, it's hard to give a comprehensive list while avoiding spoilers - y'know?There's a huge variety of ships, primary weapons (lasers) and secondary weapons (typically missiles).The community athard-light.netare constantly creating new content by developing their own missions and campaigns - which you can do yourself - as well as enhancing the game engine, working on new models and textures, improving AI... and it's all yours for free!The community athard-light.netprovide technical support for Freespace 2 Open.Advice to those who buy itY'know what's better than playing a game 15 years old?

The game didn't run at first and gave the message: """"Freespace2/Fred2 cannot be run from a drive root directory!"". After looking around and saw some crazy solutions finally came to this very simple steps (no need for you to edit anything just  click 3 times):A) Go to the directory that the game was installed inB) Go to the 'data' folderC) DOUBLE click on the file 'FS2.reg'D) Click 'Yes' When asked if you want 'Registry Editor' to make a system changeE) Click 'Yes' When Registry Editor asks if you are sure you want that changeF) Click 'OK' when Reg Edit says it's doneG) Run the game and enjoyOK with that out of the way, one more point: you need a mouse (or preferred: a stick game controller). I was using the mouse tab from the laptop and then tried to navigate with the keystrokes and it is just too hard that way. You need to aim.This is a 10+ year old game and I think the last great space simulation. Great game. You play a pilot and get promoted along the way until you are controlling your aircraft and giving instructions to wingman. Here are some highlights:+ A campaign well thought out. After a few missions you get involved in it. Feels like an epic campaign.+ Even through you are controlling your aircraft and giving missions to a few wingmen, you feel you are part of large battles. Lots of aircraft flying around.+ Great tutorials, which are made nicely as training missions needed to be completed to get promotions. Also tutorials are made throughout  the campaign. So you start with a few tutorials and latter on you do some more advanced ones.+ The game is easy to get into. Part of it is the tutorials and the level design very well done.+ Aircraft have multiple kinds of weapons, shields, you can call another aircraft to resupply you.+ High production valuesMinus points:- Graphics feel a bit outdated.- Need mouse or better stick controller.- There will never be a Fresspace 3 :("

It is the game that defined the genre and set the standard for all games of it's type for the future.You play the role of a Terran (human) fighter pilot fighting against a seperatist Terran faction when the doom bringing alien race, defeated in the first game (which was equally good) known as the Shivans appear and threaten the Terrans and Vasudans (old enemy turned allies).The gameplay is dynamic and the missions diverse in objective, from dogfighting avast array of fighters, to bombing capital ships or going undercover on special missions. The graphics are more than decent for a game of it's era and the physics are superb.I would recomend using a mouse/keyboard for gameplay rather than a joystick or gamepad, because space goes in all directions and relying on a joystick can get confusing sometimes."

Fast, tense dogfights against other fighters while huge ships try to shred you with flak and giant energy beams. A single player campaign with well built and narrative missions with some really intense and memorable gaming moments. No fluff, no grinding, just great storytelling and gameplay. What is there not to like?Thanks to the opening of the game engine source, the community of FS2 lovers has been maintaining and updating this game with newer artwork and graphical effects and multiple full-length campaigns so that it looks beautiful and works perfectly on modern systems. I revisit this game every 3 years or so and it keeps getting better! It now runs on Windows 10 and even works on 4k!!

After several years of hoping this game would appear on Steam (My physical copy is getting old), it finally made it and I got it and the first game in a heartbeat. The game is the best space-flight combat simulator that I have ever played. Rich with its own lore and story, Freespace 2 has much to offer. Two different storylines (The main campaign and the Hammer of Light) are available right off the bat to get you started. The main campaign gives you an in-depth tutorial on how to play (I play with the keyboard because I think it is easier) and it has joystick combatability.Another nice thing about this game is the amount of support it has from its fanbase. Freespace Open is a mod that updates the graphics to a more modern equivalent and it opens you up to different mods that include Battlestar Galactica, Wing Commander, and there's even a Star Wars mod.In conclusion, I must recommend this game to everyone who sees it. There were some problems with the launch of this game on Steam, but if you are using Freespace Open and follow one of the guides, you will no problem getting this game correctly instaled.9.5/10"

This engine also powers the total conversions for the Wing Commander-based Saga and Battlestar Galactica-based Diaspora games as well.So with Freespace 2, you're not just buying one game, you're purchasing a portal into years of fan-based work and content that goes well beyond the amazing base game. And heck, even if you never used the SCP, you'd still have one of the finest space games around.

I was very happy to see them on Steam. So I got my CH figther stick out and started playing. FS1 was awesome but FS2 GREATLY improved the graphics (despite being released a year apart).I forgot how great both these games are.  A lot of keys to remember but not too many to be tedious. Many  missions were nailbiters and kept me interested. Again, I forgot how easily they both can suck you in to its universes. FS2 was better because it is graphically much more appealling.I bought both on sale, however, they are both worth the standard $10 bucks Steam is charging. No buyer's remorse from this customer.Both can be played with FSOpen mods fromwww.hard-light.net(with updated graphics etc.). I chose to play the originals so that Steam could log my time played. If you want an involved fighter space sim, this is the series that you want. This is a perfect distraction until Star Citizen is up and running.

Remember, when Wal-Mart still had PC games? One of my friends had been raving about it, and he was a pretty big nerd, so I figured I'd give it a try. I didn't expect much from a game released the same year as StarCraft, but it was only $10 so what the hell? I took it home, popped it into the CD drive of my 200MHz Pentium MMX machine with 32MB of RAM and a video card with 4MB of memory...AND WAS BLOWN AWAY. The explosions, the lasers, the enormous capital ships...It made X-Wing vs TIE Fighter (my other big space flight sim crush) look like a cartoon. Not a good cartoon either; more like something I would draw. I loved it. I lived it. I wanted the sequel. But FreeSpace 2 wouldn't run on my old girl.Then, one day browsing Steam, I said ""I wonder if they have FreeSpace 2."" OMG, yes they do! And there's a mod project for it called FS2 Open, with a ton of user-generated content and tweaks? That lets me play at my monitor's full resolution?

Find it through Google and bring this classic, masterpiece of a game to the modern day.I will go on record and say it: Freespace 2 is the best space flight sim ever made. It has never been beaten and no game has ever really come close to matching the high-octane action and depth of control gameplay, nor have they ever matched the amazing sense of scale (Freespace 2 truly gives you large capital ships and swarms of fighters), nor have they ever beaten Freespace 2's incredibly atmospheric and surprisingly deep story of apocalyptic hubris. It is a game I have kept on my hard drive since first playing it in 2000.The voice acting is solid and understated, befitting the professional military nature of the story. The music fits. The gameplay is fast-paced with missions ranging from dogfights to blockades to covering capital ships as they duke it out with beam cannons, flak batteries and torpedoes. No space sim has come close.The fan community has kept the game alive for the past decade. So, while there is no final conclusion to the Freespace saga, many talented individuals have turned out many professional campaigns and mods. There are even huge projects for popular series like Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, Star Wars and Wing Commander. If this reviewer may make a recommendation, when you finish FS2, move onto the Blue Planet campaigns for a thrilling possible take on Freespace 3.The best space sim ever made. 10/10. Buy it."

Just a few mouse clicks and all is good.Anyways onto the game if you were like me and played the first Freespace and were left wondering where is number two. Well here it is. The game is very much like the first one and is also designed as a linear gameplay model. Must complete one section to move on. The controls unfortunately must be learned through training tutorials. Which if you feel confident you can skip and make it on your own. This unlike the first one has cutscenes which add a lot more to the story.

Old school simulator(ish) style gameplay with basically everything done right.  Review will be for both Descent Freespace 1 and Freespace 2.1) Gameplay flight mechanics and controls:  Flight is simplified to mimic atmosphere flight mechanics (Arcade style) but the controls are simulator style.  Power managment, shield distribution, ETC.  Joystick control is reccomended but the mouse can be used as well.2) Story:  In my opinion, THE ABSOLUTE BEST STORY I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN A GAME.  The story is told through Cutscenes, Pre-mission briefings, and sometimes even during your mission.  Oh...and the games intro scene is the best cutscene in any videogame ever.3) Graphics:  Excellent if it were 1998-2000, however now the graphics do not hold a candle to current games.  However a dedicated group of programmers have created the ""Freespace 2 Source Code Project"" AKA ""Freespace 2 SCP"".  Simply explained, this project updates all the graphics to about modern day [2015 (ish)] standards.  In order to use SCP project you must have purchased Freespace 2.  Then the SCP project will allow you to play the following things with the updated graphics:   Freespace 1 (Descent Freespace), Freespace 2, as well as additional fan made campaigns.I could go on and on about the greatness of the Freespace games but let me ask you a simple question instead.  Can you remember the last game you played where the graphics were amazing (now using SCP Project mod), you had no issues or complaints with the controls or game performance, and the story was so amazing that you can remember it 15 years later?

The AI in this game does not suck and can excel at dispatching your teammates and you if you are not careful and the same can be said about your own teammates, although they will sometimes need a helping hand when an enemy gets behind them and will inform you of the same thing.The guns and missiles that you will unlock as you progress through the game will allow the adding (if the ship allows it)  of individual guns into slots to complement eachother such as a gun with good hull damage but not very good shielding damage with a gun with the opposite properties. Missiles range from lock ons, fire and forget and dumb fire and are useful in quickly taking down enemies or turrets.The line up of ships vary from space superiority fighters, intercepters, heavy fighters and bombers and in most cases have multiple versions of the types with differing armoring, speeds, manoverability and gun and missile (and differing amounts of the same missiles you can carry) slots.The actual playing of the game is smooth and other than a few hiccups in framerate runs incredibly well and the fights can become challenging and exciting for the player with the right difficulty, the HUD on your screen will keep you up to date with monitoring crucial ships to protect and constant tracking of any ship that you can target.The joystick is a very effective tool for this game as with the mouse i found that the fighter would zoom of my screen(thank god for the display that shows up at the edge of the screen to tell me where to turn)and i would have to swipe the mouse a few time in the direction i wanted to go before I had visual contact again but unlike the mouse i found myself overshooting the target lead multiple times with the joystick but thats probably because i'm bad at using it.The game also has a mission editor called FRED2 that I personally enjoyed playing around with but requires a understand of how the coding in the engine works, for example the corvettes will not fire their main lazers until you give them the ability to by going into the events editor and enabling it there by replacing the operators of the event I made for it, despite that you can change the name of the ships in this program and had fun giving them wacky names.Overall the game is impressive and is highly entertaining. The only negatives i have for this game is that:1. I bought this a day before the special(thanks steam)2. once during a mission a prompt in the coding did not activate as it should and i flew around for a few minutes while nothing happened before deciding to reset which fixed the problem the second time around.3. Resolution...but that's just nitpicking at an old game.But other than that i could not give a higher recommendation for anyone to at least pick up the game for a little bit to play through."

If you are a fan of any of the great space simulator/shooter games like X-Wing/Tie Fighter, Wing Commander, or others, this is a must have for your collection. 9.5/10."
