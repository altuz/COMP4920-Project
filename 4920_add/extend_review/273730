I've just hit the car while parking and no points were taken from me, game only considers some area to activate ""success"" trigger if your car touches this area. This is a good idea to give people some software to train their driving but I see laziness of developers in every aspect of this game."

It basically feels like you just made the detail higher and added a WASD control. Game controllers do NOT work correctly and the options menu and key changing menu is such a piece of garbage.I wish I could get refunds back because I would in a heart beat. If you are going to release a god damn simulator, MAKE SURE IT EVEN SLIGHTLY WORKS AND HAS THE SIMULATION FEEL LIKE THE REST OF THE OTHER ONES!I bet if you compared this game to Flight Simulator 2014, IGN would have rated it a 10/10 compared to this piece of garbage!Take my advice and don't buy the game, I have every game the company made on my mobile device, and it's way better to just go get that version FOR FREE, FREE!

Instead of buying this game and being disappointed here are some actually GOOD car games that you should buy instead. IRacing , Asseto Corsa , and if you have the money DiRT4 and Project CARS 2 are games you should look at. Theres only one problem with these games in this scenario they're all racing not just driving in the city or something like that but even though this is one of the only city type driving games its not worth and should be free for how bad it is."
