,Not Recommended,273740,10372864,"Posted: 6 June, 2014",all,I crash at random,"This game/simulator packs the same punch as most unfinished products released on Steam.Although I've had my share of fun with it, there are just too many faulty elements to make it sustainable.I recommend this game if the price is of trivial importance and you have an hour to kill.Pros:-The info on the Store Page seems correct.-Graphics looks alright-Scenery is nice-The music is smooth (country'ish)-The driving itself is comforting-You get to drive a truckCons:-This product probably skipped beta.-The game spits and stutters. With all settings turned way down, my gaming rig still coughs.-Physics needs work. Although driving is fun enough, there are a lot of exciting places to get stuck and crash into.-Camera view is an endless pain in the boot. There are no modes like chase-cam etc.-When you finish a mission by offloading the goods, your vehicle will most likely stop working. $500 tow fee, just to rub it in.This also kept reverting my selection of the bigger truck to the one that you start with.-AI vehicles are unpredictable and will not hesitate to slow down if you tailgate them, just to make absolutely sure that you'll either ram them or perform some spastic manouvers.-The game does indeed crash at random without spitting any error messages. Game progress reverts to last clean exit."

,Not Recommended,273740,10388410,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,dhebard,"Graphics are horrible, very glitchy. NPC cars AI is non existant. They drive about 5-10 mph and stop alot. Only 2 camera views, no rear view. Can not see to hook up trailor. Reminds me of a bad 90's game. The game will freeze every time, normally within the first 10 min. This is my first UIG game, with I had read about them first. I was hoping it would be a good MAC Truck sim, but lt is not. I will never buy from them again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE. The first Euro Truck Sim is decades ahead of this game."
,Not Recommended,273740,10381346,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,icsparks,I downloaded the game yesterday. After 10 to 15 minutes worth of play the game continues to freeze. It was a complete waste of money. It is a shame as for when I did play my son was enjoying watching and that is why I got the game. Like others I too wish I could return the game if there is no fix for the freezing.
,Not Recommended,273740,17608983,"Posted: 18 August, 2015",all,Azatoth,"The ""Extreme"" in the title refers to how bad this game is. The map is extremely small, the trucks handle extremely bad, the AI is extremely spastic, the bugs are extremely prolific and annoying, etc. DO NOT BUY, or at least DO NOT PLAY if you are a collector. At best this is not a truck simultator, its a simulation of a truck simulator.Pros: nice lightingCons: everything elseWorst offences:Trailers seemed oversized and some are extremely top heavy causing you to roll even at slower speeds (30mph). Sometimes it will just jackknife instead for something different. Turning trees off does help mitigate this, but the game forgets your settings and still places them in other areas. It seems you have to turn them off 4 times to cover the whole map.Controls are extremly sensitive and the limited options dont seem to have any affect on that. Combined with the constant drifting (which is not caused by lack of deadzone) you will often experience the problem above.Speed is slow, 1st truck is luck to get to 40mph, 2nd can get to 50mph. Speed gauge only has 45 and 90 displayed on the dial.Terrible map design. There are parts of the road that have guard rails on the edge of the lane, not the edge of the road. Combined with the 2 problems above, you will soon start driving offraod to avoid crashing and getting stuck. Driving offroad is possible since trees are only imaginary. You can get stuck on uneven ground though, or smash into a mound of dirt that is a little too steep. Some parts of the road have chunks i them as well. The roads are very limited and can all be driven in under an hour. There is an annoying section at the bottom that doesnt connect and results in driving half way around the entire map just to get to the other side. Extremely annoying when you are on the wrong side and meant to be on the other.Faulty map and lack of GPS means you will sometimes have trouble finding where you are meant to go. Part of the map is outside the map boarders so if you need to drive there, you are going blind because it wont show on the minimap. Also you will need to stop while checking the map, becasue the game wont pause. Looking at the whole map and not returning to your location, while cause the minimap to not show where you are anymore.NO SAVES: seriously, if you play a few hours and the game crashes, tough luck. The only way to save is exit the game.AI is extremely slow, except when they come from behind and smash your truck off the road. Ram the cops as you see fit, there is no penalty aside from normal crash damage. Your truck does seem to be extremely light though, so expect to get plently of air time."

Overall sub-standard experience. 18WoS was 100% better even for it's age, hell even rig-n-roll is a better game, buyer beware."

Graphics was fine but slowed down the process quality. It also has limited controls and just felt like it was slaped together to make a buck. Very dissappointed with it. not worth playing.
