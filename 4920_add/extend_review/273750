I purchased this game from Reiza awhile back and decided to re-purchase it on the Steam platform...I know I could have used my original game key but it is not very expensive, so I thought I would support Reiza again.The game runs very smoothly (on my system) in triple screen and looks even better in triple screen 3D running the TriDef Software.I use a G27 and the FFB is very good and with a variety of other controllers (TH8 Shifters -H-Pattern and Sequential, Button Box)...which makes for throughly enjoyable racing and they all map great with a little help from Xpadder.Graphics quality is fantastic for an old gmotor engine and Reiza have done a wonderful job at massaging the extra Visual detail, Physics and Sound quality out of it....again highly recommended"

So most gamers must play single player mode vs the AI trucks. The AI cars of both FT and SCE games are good, but not almost perfect, like the Race07 game, they can't behave well in many sudden and unexpected situations.Overall it's a good (and unique) game, i wish the AI was better and there were free multiplayer servers with many players."

Beautiful trucks with modified engines and drivetrains, extensive body aerokits.  I hope that Reiza will continue Formula Truck series with new seasons. Highly recommended simulation."

This is not really a game for everyone, this is a hard core sim, and the trucks themselfs are not that easy to drive. its heavy, got lots of torque, and not that agile. but the long breakingzones, and really good drafting and accelration that they do have makes it great at pack racing. Despite logic, the tracks used are tight, often far more narrow then you would want. but, thats what makes this fun.  The ai is top notch and the physics are pretty solid as well. the sounds are also great.that being said, for people with a wheel, I strongly recomend it, for people with only a gamepad,(which I have played half of my hours or more with) its still very playable, but, I would struggle to recomend it as much.If you own stock cars extream and love that, get this and love this as well.overall, i really have to recomend this, especaly when its on sale, really fun, and a great way to waste hours of your life"

But...there's always a but...it's simply not all that fun. The trucks are pretty cool to look at and listen to but there's nothing else left you can do with them. The turning radius is pretty darn awful, even when you're driving utterly slow and still, the tires wear down fast. The speed is dramatically slower then a car and you never get that racing feel...other then when you hear it spool up. The AI isn't entirely challenging but it gives you a run for it, every now and then. Don't get all gassed up over the trailers, the graphics aren't that great. There's no customizing, no color scheme changes or create a driver option. It's just simple game.  You'll put some hours into racing but you'll get bored quickly. I suggest not to get your hopes up. If you're a customizer...I'd pass. Oh btw...the xbox gamepad controls are a bit funky, good luck configuring!"

Steering wheel is awfully sensitive with keyboard arrows or even with xbox 360 gamepad!Although Menu view is so simple,controller and racing settings are complicated.And graphics aren't good as you see in the pictures(with full graphic settings)By the way, when i changed the camera angle to the backside of the truck, game begins freezing occasionally.Braking is terrible...Shortly: Totally dissappointment!!I'm very regretful to buy this piece of game !!"

But it is.No problem, but if you price your mod like that, you should at least work at main themes of a racing game, like AI. They didn´t, it´s as stupid as it´s always been in rF.Physics, graphics and stuff are done well, but it´s all still rF1 out of 2005."

,Not Recommended,273750,26181474,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Great Joe,"I got this game because the idea of trucks going fast is hilarious to me. That was a bad decision.After spending 40 minutes navigating the world's most obtuse menus to find the right button to exit the pit lane, I was going around a beautiful track and exiting the tarmac on every corner. No really, unless you're already an expert, judging brake distances is impossible. There's no driving school, and trying to find guides not in Brazilian Portuguese is an exercise in futility. Unless you already know all the ins and outs of driving a REALLY FAST TRUCK you aren't getting anywhere in this game.Considering Reiza Studio's track record, though, I'm sure this is an excellent simulator for the people already in the know. This is probably your only option decent for simulating the act of being in a fast truck, racing against other fast trucks on the various tracks around Brazil. On those terms, I'm sure this will treat you well, but please keep in mind that you won't learn how to drive these trucks with this game.Wheel and pedals with force feedback required."

,Recommended,273750,16765861,"Posted: 28 June, 2015",all,Dave R,"I've played far more hours of this game then what shows in Steam and just like every other Reiza product, recommend it fully.  If you like trucks and you like racing, then you'll like this game.  If you're on the fence about it, go try the 60 minute demo on Reiza's website and see what you think.  The trucks are different to drive of course.  You'll need to stop sooner and get a feel for how the trucks handle.   This title is classic Reiza though.  The handlng is well done, the tracks are well done, and the force feedback is just right.  I normally use a Logitech Driving Force Pro, but hooked up an XBOX 360 controller and it works just fine as far as controlling the car.  The only negative I can come up with for this review iis that I'd love to see more tracks and trucks but I'm sure that Reiza is working on that.  All in all, a great game at a great price."

They need to remove 1.10 and update that on there site, Casue this is causing steam mismatches and more I had to put V1.25 in my game title. I hope this aint dead if it is then I will be sad this game is amazing. I suggested these updates.-Tire marks on pavement-Smoke out the sides-Smoke on tire in turns-other manufacturers if possible Ford, Scania and whats missing.-Glowing brakes and sparks if you lose a tire or scrape a wall.- Updated Calendarhttp://www.formulatruck.com.br/calendario.asp"
