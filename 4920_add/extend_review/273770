There are some really basic ""generic flaws"" and then there are the ""content flaws"".For the generic flaws the controls are pretty counter-intuitive (Escape always takes you to the main meny, right mouse click escapes from the screen), there is no pause option! For me pause is an important option, I mean even if it wasn't....The contrast in sounds is horrible, when playing the tutorial you will barely be able to hear the person explain the game due to the background sounds (also the voiceacting is just horrible, I would have rather had no voiceacting at all), besides that the tutorial is just horrendous and not user friendly at all. Also, every notification slows your game down, so when it feels the need to tell me kids threw stuff at my house or that my competitors made a new game it slows my game down again, this is really tedious as the messages are irrelevant to me!Now the obvious lackluster, depth, there is nothing to be gained here, you can't train your people, you can't invest in anything. The only thing you do is wait and watch the boards while you again click on a ""genre & language(s)"" to create the concept for you new game. As time progresses you get new technology available but not through any effort of yourself.Then there is another thing, I need to take a publisher contract to push my games to stores, but for some weird reason I have to print my own discs and keep track of that stock! That is NOT gamedevelopment, that is what the publishers are supposed to do for me.There is another game like this available on Steam which just blows this title away, I was dumb enough to think this was the sequel, save your money, buy the other title!"

So you can create a game and not be able to publish it for months and months. Not that it matters since you can't earn off it anyway.Basically, this is NOT Game Dev Tycoon, which is what you probably wanted to buy but the title of this tricked you into looking here. If you haven't paid a penny for it already, DON'T! If you have bought it then you have my condolences."

Even for free. Time ain't gettin' refunded here.In this game, you're supposed to be playing as a game developer that's supposed to be evolvin' through the ages, and with those ages, you're supposed to be developing better games. Makes sense in theory. The game starts in 1982, and ages from there. Unfortunately I never got to figure out what year the game goes up to because I never really got to play.The game crashed on startup for campaign mode after I tried to cycle past the third character, thinking that the characters cycled. They don't. The game obviously doesn't have enough data to loop back to character one so it decides to suplex your game into a vegetable state. On Windows 10, I also couldn't force close the game with task manager, I had to lobotomize my computer by restarting it, or signing out and signing back in.The game was nice enough to let me play after my fourth attempt, but only when I gave up on Campaign Mode and went into Endless Mode. The bad news is that Endless Mode doesn't have an explanation or tutorial, so I was about as ready and experienced to play the game as a couple who waited until marriage to bang it out for the first time. The game's feature advertised an interactive advisor (for when I needed advice). I saw Clippy approximately zero times during my experiences in Tycoonsville.But after making my industry-breaking engine, and being insulted by my PDA for clicking on a mouse-hole, I sought a loan at my neighborhood loan shark. But as I approached his (or her, never met 'em) den, the game crashed again for the last time.Score & BreakdownScore: 0/10+5 for Existing-1 for having the game crash on me-2 for having the game crash so hard i had to restart my computer-2 for having garbo sound, art, character development, plot, and just about everything elseIf you think this review has the potential to crucify Jesus Christ, then feel free to review its fully URL'd glory below:https://youtu.be/GXox0e4Ox1Q"

Lame tutor spokesman to get you started that doesn't even teach you the stuff that would be much harder to figure out on you own. Game has a cluster of*** art and different places to go with no signs or any way that make for ease access. Game does not speed up fast enough or slow enough for that matter when you want it to. Ultimately this $1 has contributed another burdon that I actually had to painstakenly write this review to realise what a waste of time I spent writing about the $1 I spent.

Where do I hire people (not to the right, that's for sure!)?Frankly, it's hard to navigate through and the character moves at a snails' pace, it's a struggle to even publish your first game, let alone build a gaming empire! And let's not talk about the sound issues. In the factory, for example, the machinery sounds drown out the tutorial. Okay, great. At least going to the save menu and back gets rid of the sounds for you. Oh, and the voices are bundled in with general sounds so there's no easy 'turn down sounds to hear voices' option either.A lot more work is necessary before this is a game worth playing. At least I can say I bought it super cheap but still... I wish I'd read the reviews before I did drop that $3 on it because frankly, I thought it was Game Dev Tycoon and that I was getting a deal. Any chance of a refund?"

,Recommended,273770,9891907,"Posted: 21 April, 2014",all,Liwolfbyte,"Having knocked up a couple of hours, I think I'd share some information and feedback about this game. In part, to counter many of the negative reviews that don't give the game the credit it deserves, but also to give an honest perspective.To start with, let me say that it doesn't necessarily deserve the negative feedback that it's getting. The problem here, that I see, is that some are experiencing issues with the game and the software tutorial itself doesn't give a whole lot of help to resolve it. That said, there are some issues that deserve mentioning and some interesting features that also deserve a few words.Graphically, the game is pretty nice and certainly well laid out. There are different areas to head to for specific intentions and it works well. The controls are well thought out and it's effortless to shift between each area. Use of the right mouse button to transition between areas is an boon - since many of this sort of game neglect the use of said button. The music, too, isn't too annoying and blends nicely in the background, with an easy to find method of turning it off and on. It's smooth and not too demanding on modern systems (meaning pretty much any system from the last 5-8 years) but that's to be expected in an older title.The game itself seems to borrow some ideas from other games, which isn't unheard of. There's a few places where I immediately thought of Airline Tycoon/AT: First class. Again, not a bad thing but hardly innovative either. There's lots of clickables in the world, though there's no real explaination of what they do, if anything and I did notice on the official forums/website for the game that there's very limited support for English speaking individuals, whereas there's a wealth of support for German speakers. Hardly the end of the world, but considering the planet is more English speaking than German, maybe something to look at down the line.On to the negatives.To start with, I have to make mention of the lack of subtitles. Many of the spoken lines can be hard to hear through any form of background music, be it ingame or otherwise and with no means to read that spoken word, rather than listen to it, it's a little annoying.Also, the method the game uses to publish your titles. You have to have a contract with a publisher - there's no method of self-publishing (at least, not as far as I got - which was into the early 90s) and promotion of your titles doesn't really seem to fit. This is one of the game-killers for me. I can earn money - make some top notch games but without a method of publishing, I'm limited to the contracts on offer and that, to me, makes little sense. If you're sitting on a few million and you have the means to buy a publishing company, you would if it was financially viable.Also, there's a lack of polishing to this game and, again, I recognise that the game is ancient in PC gaming standards ( 8 years or so). Nevertheless, a little extra work could have made the game more enjoyable. There's a great start here, but it needs more, especially as the tycoon market seems to be pickiing up again and competition is starting to hit the shelves again (Game Dev Tycoon immediately comes to mind).Speaking of which. Another of the features this game is really missing is R+D and this is something that goes right back to the dawn of computer gaming. Without R+D, there would be no innovation, nothing to set the big companies aside from the little. Also, when you take over a competitor, it would be nice if you could keep the name and use it for, say, publishing or research or whatever else your mind fancies, rather than the name disappearing. There's little to stop you from taking over and becoming an umberella company that publishes games from your child-companies.The game, on the whole, is good, though it has little replay value because it ends up being a chore to rinse, lather, repeat. Adding more staff options would help and delegating some of the more mundane tasks to AI workers would allow you to manage the areas you want to, without having to keep doing the same thing over and over.All in all, if you're looking for a distraction and want a few hours of game play here and there, it's worth the investment. It's the sort of game I, personally, would keep going back to while deciding what main project I want to start (Mount fo Blade, Tropico 4, whatever) and it has some value there. However, if you want something more meaningful, either look at Game Dev Tycoon (also an indie title and a demo is available) or wait and see what happens with Game Tycoon 2."

Yes, you get to create games and sell them on a market, but I look at it alittle different. At first I found it alittle frustrating trying to figure the game out, why it was so difficult to make any money and lose over and over so quickly even on EASY. This is probably the main reason most people rage and troll the game, not every game is intended for young children with little to no attention span. Now with that elephant out of the room...  The word tycoon, makes me think of business, to rule over all competitors like the a particular board game that just makes everyone mad at each other at the end of the game LOL. So basicly I am saying this game, true to its name is, to at least me, saying that it is a Company trying to be the best business out there..and for those of you that really understand how business works, lets just say it really doesn't matter what you are selling, what it is really about is profit and the benifits you can buy with it once you make more and more of it. I would recommend this game more for mature, oldskewl gamer types. Sometimes its not about the graphics or the gameplay..sometimes its about figuring out how to not be a noob, intil one day you look back and laugh at yourself with great achivement and humility, because you overcame so many of your mistakes. That to me is a real game, pff you kids today are so spoiled with your save points every 10 feet..there used to be a time where one tiny tiny mistake made you completely restart hours and hours of progress.ANYWAY LOL...a few hints for those of you that read all this ribble-rabble. *****HINTS****get a max loan..make any game quick and cheap doesnt matter just get it out into the market and advertise your image alittle. doing this will raise your stock % from a crap share to a few dollars, trust me its a HUGE difference if you have say 1000000 shares... just saying any way once you get like 2-6$ a share sell it all and get a few million in the bank, pay back your loan and SHAZAM! you have just earnd better credit, dont worry you can just make a ""erotic game"" genre to lower your image a.k.a your stock value and just rebuy it at .01 a share just after you sold all of it for 5$ a share LOL and you can rebuild it again and again, trust me this game is uber fun and easy once you get the hang of it, so trolls, go play cod or something and leave the indie games to the professionals :P THANKS FOR READING IF YOU DID,KUZURNOTA-L7WEINER ;D"

I mean yeah, GDT looks better and has streamlined flash-level graphics, but it's also simpler. GT 1.5 seems to be more detail oriented and gives, what I assume,  a more plausble notion of realism to the type of industry this game imitates(i.e. traveling around, the hiring factor, bank loans, etc.).Also, honestly, the people up in arms this being a copy of GDT or Game Dev Story need to try coming up with lives and then coming up with their own Game Development Sim and try to make something complete opposite of what's already been done.
