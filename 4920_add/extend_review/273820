I am going to request my money back because this game is not suited to purpose and is unplayable"

The gameplay is tedious and extremely boring and repetetive. Graphics are about Sega Saturn quality. The background is in 2 dimensions and looks like it was copy/paste from Google Earth. Vehicles have crap speed and handling. You can capsize a truck when going 20 mph! The mechanics are extremely confusing and take about an hour to grasp. The whole thing is sloppy. TNT doesn't cause explosions, it just makes dirt ""magically"" dissapear. The glitches are AWFUL. In one vehicle, the camera spased out and I couldn't see it, even after restarting the game. The TDM requires concrete in order to build the tunnel. But there is not enough concrete within the level to suffice the TDM and it doesn't respawn. So, that's how I failed the TUTORIAL. The biggest problem about the big picture is, it doesn't feel like the player is in control. He has to do whatever the game allows him to. For example, you can't drive into certain parts of the excavation site, losing sense of freedom. Which is what the simulator is all about. It just makes you feel like building an actual tunnel in real life. But that's the big issue with this game. The ENTIRE purpose of a simulator is to augment an experience in which feels like real life, without it actually being so. The fact that it fails the one key piece of a simulator, just makes this a bad simulator. So, just forget about ever having a fun experience with this game, and just get Euro Truck Sim. You'll have many more hours of entertainment than this garbage. Also, I've heard about some performance issues. But, I have a GTX 760 and can run the program with max details just fine. So I haven't really found this as a valid issue."

I personally think this game is worth it, but if you are interested ing tunneling, this is not a good game. I can't say I am. But this can be low quality.I would describe this as:A nice game, but it can be bad graphics and especially the physics."

Graphics and controls are what you can expect from a simulator but as your tunnel grows it feels great to take a van down it, while trying to avoid hitting your train. From what i can tell the first thing you have to do is turn the graphics quality down because you can't really see a difference in quality but the performance improves like crazy."

You go to the effort of thinking about a simulator, then what? Oh I know, I will make it so crap noone will ever follow in the genre.I want a gold mining simulator like Discovery Goldrush, if United Independent Development ever ask Discovery for a licence I hope they check out Steam first....You ruined my life and I set fire to live Gerbils fun."
