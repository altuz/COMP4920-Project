Top 10 Reasons are; in no particular order.....1 - $45 AU gets you the full game with loads of content. No more to pay.2 -  Mods galore ! over 400 tracks , more than 120 car mods, and most are very high quality.3 - Frame rates are impresive. My R9 290x cards smash 200 + FPS with max everything and 28 cars on track.4 - FFB is easy to setup and feels great !5 - Day / night transition during race is posible and totaly cool.6 - Being an Australian the SuperV8's are the most fun i have had in my 25+ year Sim Racing Hobby. They are sensational cars to drive and GSCE have nailed it.Combined with the Historic V8 skin pack, racing Peter Brock, Allan Moffat,♥♥♥♥♥♥Johnson, Mark Skaife, Garth Tander, the kelly brothers, Craig McLouchlan, and even Neil Crompton , Just to mention a few,  around an excellent version of Bathurs was well worth the entry fee alone. Bloody sensational.7 - By Far the best AI in the business, once you find your skill  level. Close hard racing. Amazing.8 - The option for manual pit stops and strategies adds presure and excitment.9 - Constantly evolving. The next update due in the next month promises great things.10 - IMO, the most overall complete Sim as far as features go.There is more but i drive faster than i type."
,Recommended,273840,15269261,"Posted: 8 April, 2015",all,Paul,"tl,dr: SCE has tons of great content and compelling gameplay and is worth your time and money.When I first saw Stock Car Extreme on Steam, I thought it seemed like something that wouldn’t interest me. “Stock Cars” mostly means NASCAR in the US, and I don’t like that kind of racing. And “Extreme”? Huh?It turns out the “Stock Car” comes from the Stock Car Brasil series which is similar to DTM. The “Extreme” is from Reiza’s (the developers) connection to “Cockpit Extreme Racing” which is a line of sim-racing cockpit products. I have forgiven the somewhat puzzling name.After reading some reviews and watching some YouTube videos, I tried the demo found on Reiza’s website (actually based on the 2012 version) and it clicked with me right away, so I uninstalled it and bought the game.SCE packs impressive content right there in the box. As of right now, there are 62 tracks included with the game. Most of these are located in South America or are historic versions of tracks from around the world. I think that is very cool. These are excellent circuits that are new to me, but aren’t contrived “fantasy” circuits. (Reiza knows how to make them look absolutely beautiful, too.)For me personally, not seeing Spa, for example, is a little refreshing. I do really like that track, but seems that almost every racing game these days has the same core set of famous tracks while there is so much else to see. SCE supports tons of existing mods as well as SCE-specific mods, so you’re sure to find just about any track or car you like anyway.Even though SCE is named after the Stock Car Brasil series, it offers many other classes of cars ranging from 1976 F1 cars to the Metalmoro prototype to Karts to 2014 F1 cars and more. Each class feels so different from the next that you are offered a very broad range of driving experiences.Scroll up and look at the list of DLC. Hint: it isn’t there. Reiza is continually updating the game and providing new content for free. New tracks and cars just show up in the game updates. For free.SCE has fantastic gameplay. Most sims these days have convincing vehicle physics and SCE is right up there with the best of them.• The engine, tires, and road sounds are all well done and sound great. Some of the metal-on-metal scraping sounds aren’t great, but everything else is really good.• The AI behave realistically and they make realistic mistakes, just like anyone. With the default and most appropriate aggression setting, they won’t crash into you like a dumb human, but will pass you when it’s proper to do so.• The force feedback effects are very good, but can be inadvertently ruined a little by the user if the controller settings are wrong outside of the game. There is a guide on the official Race Department forum for setting up your wheel. Once you have it set up properly, though, the FFB effects are as good as you’ll find anywhere.• There is a 24-hour cycle present in the game, so if you start an evening race (which looks fantastic), you may end up finishing in the dark.• The game modes are the usual simulation kinds of modes: there is Single Race, Testing, Championship, and of course Multiplayer. There are no “challenge” style events or modes. Just the kind of racing you might have in the real world.The in-game options let you tweak all the things you’d expect, but if you dive into the various config files, you can really tweak everything to exactly what you want. For example, I have my track map going the full height of the monitor, but only within the leftmost 20% of the screen. I also have the sectors of the track on the map display in different colors.There are many in-game options you can change while in the garage, without having to go back to the main menu like some other titles.SCE will likely work on whatever computer you happen to have. Because it utilizes the original rFactor engine (though you wouldn’t guess by looking), it is really light on system requirements. It’s almost guaranteed that anyone can get high framerates in SCE. It looks very good, but of course it doesn’t look as sugary-sweet-beautiful as Assetto Corsa or Project Cars, but sim racing is about more than just pretty pictures, isn’t it?One drawback I could scratch up is that the interface in the menus looks dated and stretched by default. There is an easy to install mod (literally just replacing a folder) that makes the front-end much nicer and easier to navigate.Also, it really works best with a wheel. You don’t need an expensive force-feedback setup, but a wheel (even non-FFB) will give you a better experience than a gamepad. When I first got SCE, I tried my Xbox360 controller and a Saitek P990 and never really got the settings dialled in very well like you might have in a Codemasters game.The gamepads were just a little too twitchy, so I dug my 16-year-old Microsoft Sidewinder Wheel (non-FFB, 200-degree-rotation) out of the garage, and it was so good. I played SCE with that wheel for a couple of weeks before the game compelled me to buy my G27.Stock Car Extreme is definitely worth buying whether you’re only interested in trying simulation racing or if you already have a collection of sim titles."

The cars feel so much better in GSCE than anything on the market.Graphics - 7/10 (this is something that isn't even noticable while driving - the graphics may be slightly dated but are still             very nice)FFB - 11/10  Nothing compares - not even close. This is the best ffb I have ever experienced. I can tell what the car is doing at all times. I have never felt this level of detail in any sim,AI - 10/10 Again the best I've seen. While having the ability to adjust the AI's skill and aggressiveness I have found them more than a pleasure to compete against at levels from 90 -105 (this is the only range I've used thus far). They act like real drivers not parading in a line riding a rail, not playing bumper cars or cutting the track. They are absolutely awsome.Car selection - 8/10 enough to keep you busy. May not be the biggest selection of cars but I have yet to race half of them. Can't get myself off the 2013-2014 stock cars .Sound - 9/10 The sound of the cars is very immersive. Sounds like you are actually there.Physics - 10/10 Everything feels dead on here. I'm no race car driver but I feel like one - that should count for something.Multiplayer - placeholder (I have yet to try this against real people yet - the Ai is keeping me company at the moment)Triple screen support - 8/10 I maybe wrong but I cannot find a way to adjust the bezel angle, but it still works great with triple monitors.There are also tons of mods available for this title- tracks, cars and just about anything else you can think of. Everything you can use for RFactor is available here too.Final thoughts:If you're  like me and looked at this title on steam, debated on whether or not you needed another sim only to pass it by and visit it again later - then stop it. BUY the game already. There is no chance you will look back after you spent the first hour on it. Plus the Devs are about to add a whole bunch of new content including updating the graphic improving the already more than perfect FFB (not sure how it can be better, but looking forward to it), adding more cars, trucks, dirt tracks and more.Just buy the game"
,Recommended,273840,16861604,"Posted: 3 July, 2015",all,FM Lad,"The first sim i bought for the pc was Race the WTCC game. which was about 4 or 5 years ago. I wasnt massively into sim racing then, it was just something i'd occasionally do, and i bought a cheap wheel and pedal set. Main reason i bought Race07 was coz i was into the BTCC and the WTCC in Race were the same cars (not exactly the same, but similar performance though some cars were in the BTCC that were the same such as the BMW 320 si).A few years later i bought ETS2 and decided i wanted to play that properly with a proper good wheel so bought a G27, which was great. Not long before i bought this wheel i bought my second racing sim, Assetto Corsa but i was hardly playing it, mainly due to the steering rotation limit on the cheap wheel i had and i still wasnt into sim racing that much. It was the G27 that really got me into it then as i thought i'd try Race07 and AC with the new wheel and boy did i love it, the FFB and everything, felt great. So ever since i've been mostly just playing racing sims and went on to buy others such as GTR2, Raceroom Racing Experience, and iRacing which is subscription based.One day i saw Stock Car Extreme, and by the sound of the name i thought it was some arcadey type play around game not worth a second look...but it was recommended to me in steam, so i gave it a look and saw so many positive reviews and i watched the videos and liked what i saw, couldnt believe it was a proper sim going by the name of it. So i ended up getting it and i can honestly say that despite the amount of different sims i have, i play this the most by far, in just offline racing as it is great. The physics, the FFB are spot on, despite the old graphics i've been loving it and i'm playing it the most despite paying a subscription for iRacing, along with the content on Raceroom.Now i said that touring cars such as the WTCC as what i like the most so i should really be playing Raceroom the most as that simulates them and has the official cars from 2013 (and now 2014) but theres just something about Stock Car Extreme that i love so much with just the physics and FFB and it has such a great range of different series including multiple types of karts and different eras of F1.I so highly recommend this game and hope everyone makes a contribution to Reiza studios' recent crowdfunding campaign. They deserve it with making such a great sim and adding so much content for free which for games like iRacing and Raceroom would cost you, per car and track, so buy this game you wont be disappointed and make a contribution so Reiza can push it beyond extreme whilst they work on their new sim, which i'm drooling over the thought of!10/10The only negative which is a downer for me is the championship scoring isnt implemented correctly and seems to be bugged, but Reiza have said they'll rectify this, even though it has been a while now but hopefully soon they'll have a permanent fix for it."
,Recommended,273840,32606706,Posted: 20 June,all,acdcdave1387,"Quick word: No need to buy this game anymore!This was an AWESOME sim racing title but has since been replaced by Automobilista. Reiza is terrific and are the masters of manipulating the original rFactor engine.Seriously though, Automobilista is the same thing but bigger, better and continuously updated."

And going but screen shots is massive improvment in looks on SCE.So do i recommend SCE..100% helllllsssss yes!!!.  does it look like Project cars? No  But as a Realistic Sim with Real and based on Real cars and championships it will keep you driving for many hours. Basicly SCE is a very cleaned up game on ISI rFactor engine, so its very user friendly, very modable, and based contant alone with Brazilian Stock cars , Mini cup, Lancer Cup, Karts , Super Karts , F1 cars from 70s, 80s, 90s , 00, 10s fictional of course but awsome to drive and my Fav Super V8s based on Aussie V8 Supercars and so many more. They have found a way to take the engine to its limit, physics, Gfx , lighting. So in all seriousness this title should be in EVERY race fans account. and keep an Eye on Reiza, as a small company they are showing the big boys how to do it right.So read other reviews its really easy to setup, play mod to suit what you want no BS."
,Recommended,273840,15719216,"Posted: 6 May, 2015",all,pleclair,"First, before you read this, go buy either the reiza bundle or game stockcar extreme, and start installing it while you read this, you'll thank me.At first sight, the title might not seems so appealing, if you are like me and nascar ain't your thing, then likely, like me, you have never checked really what was game stockcar.I've been driving in rF2 since 2012, and I had heard game stockcar mentioned a few times.  And often, people were talking about it with convictions.   I had enough with rF2 and then AC came out, spent some time with it, realized it wasn't really my cup of tea, so I'm back to rF2.  The gMotor engine sims are just the best.It is only recently that I realized that game stockcar extreme is actually brazil's stockcar, which are more like touring cars than nascars.So I bought the bundle.  And boy... I should have gotten this long before.You have to know that game stockcar is using an heavily modded rFactor 1 engine.  And pushes it so far, that you'd almost think they are using the rFactor 2 engine.For a long time, I believed ISI/Simbin were the best at making tracks, regarding accuracy, details, texturing, blending,  repetitions, etc.. they are certainly above Kunos... and I'm not talking about how they look in game, AC have a better graphic engine.But after trying out GSCE, it's clear that Reiza is at the top.  I have yet to try out all tracks, but so far, might have tried 7-8, and they all look fantastic.  Tarmac textures are the best I've ever seen.  And this goes for pretty much everything.The tracks themselves are super nice.  I would move to Brazil any day to be able to race these tracks as much as I would like to.  I'm a huge nordschleife fan, and I've raced this track for 3 years straight, and the tracks in there are very nice.  Why did I mentioned the nordschleife, not because GSCE have such a track, but I mean, the nordschleife is a nice flowing tracks, and most of those in GSCE are like this.  Very few tracks with tight hairpins, and lots of tracks with nice fast bends, plenty of challenging S, and all kind of long curves.The track surface (road definition) is probably the best I've seen as well.  The tracks feels very alive.The AI is what you would expect from a gmotor engine based game, excellent.  I have to train quite a bit on a given track in order to beat the AI at the default 95%.  They are certainly very challenging.FFB is awesome, and it's hard to say which I like best between rFactor 2 and GSCE.  That's much to say, since it's using an older engine.If you buy the bundle and get the formula truck, then you can race racing semis on the same track selections.If you like real simulators, then you are missing on much if you are passing on this."

But sadly I found most of the time, they don't make me feel I'm driving it as fast as the speedometer shows. I can ""fly"" a top Formula series in 300 km/h in-game, but it doesn't make me feel as ""nervous"" as I'm in a family wagon in 100 km/h. That's what I think they missed a lot, the immersion. But with this piece, in an old-school graphics, it did it. I don't know what magic spell did Reiza cast, but they made it, and they made it beautifully. Playing a Vee or Kart is as fun as the Extreme level now."

Easily one of the best  of there. But like with all great sims you will need a wheel with a good force feedback to fully appreciate it.

The physics leave little to be desired, the AI is fantastic, and the force feedback is the second best I have tried.  Niels is a genius.. I play almost every sim on the market, but I was late to the party with this one, and i gotta say, I was missing a lot. The Reiza content is fantastic, and it also has a great mod community, with the best mods from RFactor available (only updated and upgraded), and original mod content as well.  The physics and force feedback aren't quite at RFactor 2's level, but the content is  possibly superior in range of vehicles you get. Nothing matches the best cars in RF2, but it also doesn't have any below average content, and every single car is worthy of your time. That said, after discovering RFACTOR 2, I have been spending a lot less time here. My only complaint is that the online community is lacking, but the fault lies on us consumers and not the game itself. If you haven't tried it yet, do it. Do IT! As soon as possible, do it! If you are into sim racing, I would say this is a must have title. Forget the other big names coming out right now, as they may be prettier, but none of them will give you the complete package  and amazing wheel to wheel racing experience that this does.  If I had to name one downside to this game, it would be the UI, as it can be a little confusing at first, and isn't as polished as some of the competition.  . But that is a small price to pay for the second best sim on the market. And I haven't even mentioned the fact that Reiza is always updating, and releasing FREE new content to people who own it. There isn't a better value for your money out there. See you on the track!"

You'll have fun. Its not about stock cars: there's about 20 other types!! For multiplayer experiences, I can't really comment just yet as that has many other qualities to consider beyond the sim itself. So how does this sim stack up by itself?First, this sim's force feed back is very good (logitech G920 here) and a real factor into contributing to this being the most immersive experience of any sim I've played: you'll be sweating and busy as you'd be in a real race car. It's not a casual affair. Also if I compare this sim to Dirt Rally, Assetto Corsa, rFactor2, ... this one stands out in that it makes me smile (bit more on that later).With the physics, everything seems to makes sense.. sliding off on dirtier parts of the track, lift off leading to spins.. bit by bit I found myself learning, adjusting and driving faster. It was a challenge to drive consistenly fast and crash free for 20-30 minutes, and so the feel of achievement is just great when crossing the finish line. Luckily this is not because the game is harsh or anything. That all combined with the competent AI is I think why overall experience of racing in this sim is so good.. and FUN really. I can't help but feel that a certain thing of Brazil is showing through .. a certain something that others just lack...AI - Good and certainly the most enjoyable I've experienced. The AI is cheecky and may nudge you, it jumps in gaps, it respects racing lines decently but also doesn't drone around in one long line up. Overtaking is very rewarding.Graphics - Less than for example Asseto Corsa but easily good enough to not break the spell. My GTX970 runs 3440x1440@60Hz pretty smoothly (Maxxed but 14 cars, x2 AA, shadows high, 4xAni).Sound - Great. Just watch/listen to the videos! Works in 'hearing' the distance to others.Realism - Not a race driver, but weight transfer, weight, tweaks, grip all seem to be realistic.Gameplay - Great fun. Find a car and track(s) that gels with you, tweak the AI to be a good challenge and start a 15 minute race. The rolling start works well. Default setups are very workable.Content - Most complete sim out of the box. Plus many community tracks / mods if you're looking for a track you may want that is not in the game. Wide range of cars and car types, many South American tracks and tracks you won't find in other sims.GUI - Slightly confusing at start, not perfect but easy to get around once you get used to it.**9.8/10** Highly Recommended for anyone that is not looking for an arcade 'sims'.

I don't think so, but it can compete with it easily. The old engine simply cannot provide as detailed physics as the new upcoming sims, but it does the job - everything is there. There is no exaggerated oversteer that will make you struggle through corners, the grip levels feel just as they should, tires perform depending on their temperatures and wear, brakes too, the AI is nothing too special, but they are very raceable and challenging, even graphics-wise it manages to push out that last bit of juice out of that old technology.As far as content goes, there's plenty, even though it could use a touring or GT class in there, it doesn't really matter. This game proves that every class is fun and playable if the physics are good enough.However, F1 and open wheeler fans in general should really have this game. There are FIVE (5) F1-like classes from different seasons and eras, plus the F3 and Formula Vee.All in all, it's a really good all-round sim and it's not too expensive."

The AI adapt well (although they still have the occasional hiccup, but no coding is ever perfect...) to most situaitons you toss at them. While they tend to freight train easily that's really my only complaint in terms of how they perform. They make mistakes about as often as the actual professionals in most cases as well, so you've got that.If you have a good-but-not-cutting-edge-computer, then this is a solid choice. Plus, there are plenty of mods for tracks and additional classes of cars, so really there is no limit.However, consider buying Automoblista instead of this (unless you're on a budget), as the latter is better in many ways and also the most up-to-date version Rezia is focusing on.8/10"

,Recommended,273840,14589602,"Posted: 21 February, 2015",all,voomba,"My experience with race sims started with Race 07, about 1~2 years ago. At some time last year I got a cheap wheel that incresead my pleasure playing Race 07, and started to play Euro Truck Simulator 2 too. At this moment, I enjoyed this kind of game, but nothing so special.Things began to change when I got the Assetto Corsa in late 2014, and soon after when I bought a Logitech G27 steering wheel at the beginning of January. At that point, I started to really enjoy racing simulation games. How curious that I am, I started researching more about it in forums and sites related to this type of game, and youtube videos channels too, then I met the Game Stock Car, which always had great impressions, seemed like a good sim.Then I saw that the game Stock Car Extreme was to be released via Steam, and got the game so that was released. And since then, my experience and fun with this kind of game has been excellent. I'm not that experienced as a pilot, but the game has helped me a lot to improve, this is very positive for me.Things I think are very good in Stock Car Extreme:- It does not require many resources, works very well here with a Core 2 Duo 2.67GHz 4GB RAM and a GTX550Ti, all settings maxed running at 1920x1080.- Very good feeling of force feedback and physics. Although not an experienced driver, in this game I can feel a good feedback on the track and the car, I can feel how much more can I speed up and when to relieve the pedals. This has helped me a lot to get better.- The AI, for offline racing, excelent! As I play offline often trying to improve my skills, that's great! This is the best AI that I found (and a lot of reviews about this game confirm).- A wide variety of tracks and cars, including karts and historical categories of Formula 1.- Availability of many mods of tracks and cars, as the game is based on rfactor engine.Based on my researchs and self experience and other reviews, I think this is the best offline car racing simulator at this moment. It's a great sim.The only negative at this moment is about multiplayer, few servers and little people online, but this tends to improve with the launch on Steam, at least that's what I hope :)Thanks Reiza for this awesome sim!"
,Recommended,273840,20232996,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,jphaynes1966,"Worth every penny. I've tried quite a few of the current racing sims but this is the one I play most often and have the most fun with. I'm only loosely a real race driver (24 Hours of Lemons). I do spend quite a bit of time just lapping most the tracks and trying out new cars. I can't say I'm very fast but with this game I'm having a ball.The best part is I don't need a massively expensive setup to make this sim work. It runs great on my i5 and a used G27 I picked up from Amazon. With Project Cars and Assetto Corsa, my machine struggles to keep up with the amount of graphics. As much as I like the super realistic scenery, I really just don't need to see super detailed puddles and trees to have a great time or get a feel for how a car feels on a track. And who really needs to see that stuff in a sim anyways? When I race my concentration is on the car, the line and the next corner (and maybe a flag stand since I used to be a corner worker). But I'm not particulary paying attention to a puddle that I'm screaming by at 80 mph plus (so it doesn't need to be in 1080p if you get my drift).Loads of fun. Great price. And a great opportunity to buy into Reizas next sim."

,Recommended,273840,19919119,"Posted: 24 December, 2015",all,the.timitzers,"A sim racing game about a race series that I never heard of. How well does this game turns out? It's fantastic.As I said before, I never heard of the Stock Car Extreme (SCE), let alone the Brazilian Stock Car series. But don't let the title fool you - this game gives a plethora of race cars to choose from. I found this game through a sim racing youtuber, which praised this game quite a lot. I'm curious and decided to give it a go, and how! What a wonderful racing simulation game it is. Prior to this, I have only played old - but trusted - sim racing games such as GTR 2, rFactor (old one), Richard Burns Rally, and Race series from Simbin. I can say that this game belongs up there with the sim racing greats. Granted, I never really played any of the more modern sim racing titles such as iRacing, rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, or Project CARS, but I'm going to get there someday - and this game is the start. Hopefully they wouldn't disappoint me with their much higher price tag!What I can say from this game is it feels really immersive, at least with the cars I've tried. I currently only have driven the stock cars and several of the formula cars. My trustworthy Logitech Momo Racing still gives a very good force feedback, the sound of the cars are impressive, and the handling of the cars are very good - it's not overly hard to drive, but it is much harder to go fast. It's a bit forgiving, actually, but it's still a heck load of fun. The only down side is probably the graphics - it's definitely not as impressive as the previously stated titles, but I don't really care about the graphics anyway. I'm here for the handling physics, the racing - not for how beautiful the game looks. It's probably just me being biased for not having an impressive computer set up, though.Overall, this game is a blast - it's my first game here in Steam, and this game also introduced me to the online sim racing community in my country. Absolutely, positively, a highly recommended game for sim racers out there. Whether you just want to try out how it is to be a sim racer, or for the old time sim racer - this game is for you! I can't give it a higher score for what it did with the price. Thumbs up!"

May be good in an arcade sense but otherwise it's horrible. It's all my opinion if you can't comment respectfully your replies will be removed without a response.

This one sums up all the excellence from the games before. It loads fast and jumps out quick. The truck racing rocks too. Thank you to all who produced it and keep up the good work.

For the average racing fan, it is very easy to pick up and play but for a hardcore sim racer or actual race driver it is great for practice.

Reiza Studios did a fantastic job with the engine.Lots of cars and tracks to choose from and you can also download mods from Racedepartment and other websites. A very complete package. Highly recommended!!!(I recommend the Formula Vee at any track)

,Recommended,273840,31639148,Posted: 8 May,all,Scrumpe,"TL;DR Absoulte must buy for any sim racing fans.Pros:-Driving feels very realitic.-Fantastic force feed back. Easily the best I've ever felt in any sim game.-A large selection of cars and tracks right out of the box. It's got various F1 and F1 feeder series cars, V8 Supercars, touring cars, even karts.-Large modding community. Most mods are quite high quality as well.-Amazing AI. Once you find the right skill level, you can have great close races.-Day and night cycle. Racing while the sun sets looks fantastic.-Runs on a potato. I'm running this on a Surface 3, and can easily get 45-55 fps in 1080p, even with a large number of cars racing at once.Cons:-Not the best looking game, but acceptable.-No weather options. Dry races only.Overall:Reiza really knocked it out of the park on this one. For me, they really ticked every check box. I don't mind the graphics, since for me I'd rather have the game perform well than look amazing. The only thing that really bugs me is the lack of weather options."
