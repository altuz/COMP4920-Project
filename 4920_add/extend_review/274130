The brief moments when you actually do feel like John Rambo himself, are ruined by a whole host of bigger problems with the game. Crappy shooting, boring levels, cheap QTE's and subpar visuals.

,Not Recommended,274130,12801949,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,Bao-Le-58,"Why did I buy this game? Maybe because it was on sale and I wanted to see for myself just how bad this game was. But at around £10, I felt ripped-off. Everyone has already said what needs to be said about this game but I'm going to do it anyway.This game is an on-rail shooter with no innovations. If the developers didn't want to do anything new, they should've just developed a generic FPS game (like Call of Duty) or something. At least that way, you're able to move freely and more effort would've been put into developing the game. ""Stealth"" sequences are just QTEs and there are even QTE sequences for entire levels, which you can auto-pass with the first ""perk"" you unlock. Yes, you can complete missions by doing nothing.""Perks"" and ""abilities"" are pretty much useless in this game and guns have very little differences. No light gun support and cutscenes are awful. Ripped straight out of the first three Rambo movies, it would've been better to just put the actual scenes from the movie itself as cutscenes because the voice-acting in this game is terrible. There are multiple bugs and glitches that causes the game to randomly crash and stop game progression (sort of). On one level, when I ""moved"" to the next section, there were no enemies. Because of that, I couldn't pass and threw a grenade at myself to start from the last checkpoint as oppose to restarting the level from the beginning.The graphics are awful, the game looks like it was made in the early 90s. I don't demand the most beautiful, cutting-edge graphics in modern video games but since this game came out early this year, the graphics are way below average. Character models are some of the most laughable I've ever seen, and for some reason, John Rambo is the worst looking. He looks mentally deficient, like the puppet of Matt Damon in Team America. The trailer misrepresents the kind of game this is. This game is not a ""John Rambo"" experience. That's even a difficulty mode, the ""hardest"". Don't bother with it and just stick to Green Beret. The game will often ""move"" to sections where you're completely out in the open and can't cover, so you'll take loads of damage. That's why using Wrath Mode is very important in this game because during Wrath Mode, you heal when you kill enemies.This game is so easy until the last mission. It's not even difficult, they just throw waves of enemies at you because the developers think that that's ""challenging"". You're going to die a lot and often duck for cover, with a cover system that doesn't even work (bullets often go through) and it's one of the most frustrating experiences ever in gaming (even on normal difficulty). That's why you should avoid John Rambo mode, the difficulty is the same except you get more points on higher difficulty and you get only one more try in John Rambo mode. You get three more tries in Green Beret mode, five more tries on normal and (I assume) seven more tries on easy (whatever easy and normal modes are called in this game). Because you die often in the last level (or last two levels) having only one more try after you die is not worth it. You'll have to restart the whole level so even if you get past one wave of enemies, the game throws even more at you, making the game feel endless. There are no achievements for playing the game on John Rambo mode anyway (or any incentives to do so) so don't. If you're looking for a challenge in this game, you're not going to find any because on higher dificulty, the AI is exactly the same.You can complete this game in two hours. £30 for this p.o.s? NO! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Steam, you removed Ride to Hell: Retribution. Please remove this game, it's just as bad. Please avoid people from buying this♥♥♥♥♥♥game. I'm surprised this game hasn't hit the bargain bin, or even the trash bin. I bought Ride to Hell: Retribution (for giggles) because it was dirt cheap (£3). It's worse than this game but at least I didn't feel ripped-off after I bought Ride to Hell: Retribution. But it's ""Rambo"" so I guess that's why they're overcharging you for this turd of a game. My friend bought it full price because he told me and I quote ""it's for the fans"". He said exactly the same thing about Prison Break: The Conspiracy (because he's a fan of Prison Break too). NO!!! JUST NO!!!!! This game ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the movie license. I'm not a Rambo fan but even hardcore Rambo fans can see what a♥♥♥♥♥♥game this is and they're clever enough to avoid it.I would buy this game if it were really cheap (like Ride to Hell: Retribution) and I thought £10 (during the Halloween sale) seemed reasonable for a bad game. DON'T PAY MORE THAN £5 FOR THIS GAME OR AVOID IT AT ALL COST! I do respect different opinions but the minority who are giving this game positive reviews are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing morons who are blinded by loyalty and nostalgia. This game gets 1 point for being better than Ride to Hell: Retribution and another for making me laugh at times.2/10 - TERRIBLE"

I love rambo and thats the only reason i would see any reason to pay this game. the player models though are awful. was the game made in 2014 or 1994? i hope with all my heart somone takes the time in the future to make a good rambo that actually inclues all the movies. how can blowing thing up and shooting tons of people with an M60 be screwed up so badly. bottom line is someone needs to make a better rambo game in the future and until then you don't need to bother with this game. save your $40 and go buy the rambo movie instead and use a controller while your watching them. that is more fun to play than this game.my rating: 2/10

There are flashes of quality throughout but it's hard to feel engaged with the end product. The ragdolls are nice but the active reloading feels weak, the way the enemies just pepper at your life bar until you kill them feels even weaker. Nobody remembers THAT light gun game. Give me three or five lives and put timers on every enemy about to fire in the Virtua Cop style and I'll rock out.The score system is tense chaining and there truly is a lot of room to play for score, but I can't be bothered to.The sad thing is I probably would have paid $40 for the ACTUAL Rambo lightgun arcade game which has just got a much better tempo to it.That said, if you have as huge a love of lightgun games as I do, it MIGHT still be worth your time on the cheap.

You can shoot an enemy player five times in a row and they do not go down or die. You have to have perfect aim. Sometimes you get stuck and have to fight waves of 30 or 40 enemy players in a row without an autosave checkpoint, which puts you into the middle of a maddening loop where you die 50 times in a row and keep playing the same checkpoint over and over until you are lucky enough to squeeze through.The game is stupid hard, even on the easiest level settings. The achievements are stupid. You have no control over your movement, with the exxception of the times when the game allows you to take cover, so sometimes you will come face to face with enemy players and when you run out of ammo, you can't do anyting but just stand there and reload while they unload bullets into your face.There is no auto-reload in the game, so you constantly have to hit the (R) button over and over again for each stage.There are parts of this game that are a a lot of fun, and as someone who loved the movies, it can be fun playing through the jailbreak scene from the first movie. This game could have been so much better though. Why can't gamers get an awesome Arma style game featuring John Rambo? That's a game I would pay big money to play."

,Recommended,274130,27565517,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,chunk1632,"If you love Rambo and incredible ’80s action, then Rambo: The Video Game is exactly the game you’re looking for.As soon as Rambo: The Video Game was announced, I was ecstatic. The trailer made the game seem like nothing but balls-to-the-walls action, recreating all the kick♥♥♥♥♥Rambo♥♥♥♥♥♥that Rambo did in the Rambo movies. It was seemingly going to be everything I had ever wanted a Rambo game to be, going all the way back to 1988 when I spied the cover of the Rambo NES game and imagined what treasures the game might hold. That game did not live up to my internal hype, but Teyon’s Rambo: The Video Game didn’t just live up to my huge, unrealistic expectations, it shot an explosive arrow directly into their heart and machine-gunned them as they begged for mercy.This is not Call of Duty. This is not Bioshock. This is not Mass Effect. This is mother♥♥♥♥in’ RAMBO, one of the great action heroes of the ’80s. Teyon takes each film's unique feel and runs with it, crafting levels that are as intense and furious as Rambo himself. What other game has enough balls to throw “ONE CHANCE – YOU OR THE CHOPPER” up on the screen, right after you watch Rambo screw an explosive head on to an arrow shaft? If you don’t scream a big ♥♥♥♥ YEAH after you see that, you might consider a career in something other than playing kick♥♥♥♥♥action games.At times, though, the game does get frustrating, but I can easily explain this away with two key points. First: Rambo: The Video Game is old school in its approach, just like an old arcade game. This is a score-based video game, where skill and quick reflexes separate the Rambos from the Trautmans. Certain sequences are initially difficult, or play on the old “There’s no possible way I could have done anything about that until I died from it once” frustration, but remember the great arcade shooters of old, specifically the shmup sub-genre. If you want to do good and score high, you memorize patterns. Rambo: The Video Game is no different. And like those arcade games of old, Rambo: The Video Game doesn’t care if you make it to the next level. You only move on when you’re badass enough to do so.And secondly, there are the light RPG elements. You begin the game as a “stock” Rambo and as you play and level up, you are given skill points to invest in passive traits, as well as up to three perks that will help you succeed. We begin the game as Rambo escapes from a POW camp in a hail of bullets, the voice-over telling us that something in Rambo changed that day. This is when the man, John Rambo, was traumatized to the point of becoming the relentless killing machine we know today. Over the course of the game we are leveling up Rambo… and ourselves. What may be challenging at first is never out of reach with practice, perseverance and more power. If you keep dying, you’re just not Rambo enough yet.So yeah, you might be frustrated at first, but get up and try again. Rambo wasn’t built in a day. He was trained and molded and traumatized into the man we know, so think of your first time through the game’s levels as your training in becoming Rambo. When I started the game, I was in no way prepared for the final mission that literally ends with almost non-stop explosions coming from a series of rockets, tanks and helicopters. It’s a harrowing, exhilarating experience — perhaps the most action-packed, intense level I have ever played — but it’s one that I needed to train for.I love this game wholeheartedly, but if I had to critize something it would be the way the QTEs are implemented. Shenmue, the game that introduced QTEs, is my favorite game of all time, so I LOVE QTEs. The way they work in Rambo: The Video Game is hard to get used to, though. The button presses aren’t always intuitive, so I failed them many times over. And this isn’t Shenmue or Heavy Rain... Rambo: The Video Game does not script out conditional events based on your pass/fail of the previous QTE. If you fail, you fail. End of life. It makes sense in Rambo’s death-dealing world, but even I found my patience tested at times. The developers foresaw this and included a “No Fail QTE” perk to fix this problem, but I refused to use it. If you wanna be Rambo, you gotta take the hits and get the button pushes right! There’s nothing half♥♥♥♥♥about Rambo, so I felt like using the perk would somehow tarnish his image and make my completion of the game fraudulent.This game in an incredible tribute to the legacy of Rambo, and now features an original, extra campaign (which is also BADASS). If you LOVE Rambo, this is a must buy."

Constantly raging when dying over and over, like for example being grenaded when reloading or in cover, then retrying same mission until you finally beat it. Could be me, but playing on a pad is ten times harder than with a mouse.Bad graphics in my book do not bother as long as there is a ton of environmental destruction this game certainly has.Also, the story is movie accurate, lots of guns and hell lots of enemies to shoot at.

,Not Recommended,274130,24162867,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,ShadowAngel,"Where do i even start here? Maybe with the first thing you'll see: Rambo is dead, that's how the game starts. He died in 1988....wait, what?As a big fan of all 80's action movies and liking Rambo a lot the first thing you see is a low blow to all fans. Rambo died in this game seemingly after his third adventure, leaving out the fourth movie that came out a couple years before this abomination got released. So the developers got their hands on the Rambo franchise and seemingly ignored it.Not a good start.The game is a Rail-Shooter, meaning you're movements are pre-programmed and all you do is moving a cursor over the screen, shooting enemies, occassionaly throwing a grenade with some Quick Time Events thrown in. If the game came out in 1995 in the Arcades, it would've been a hit because it offers more than then contemporary Light Gun Shooters like Virtua Cop offered. But we're not in 1995, we're in the year 2016 and Rail-Shooters are dead, mostly for a good reason, there aren't even that many light guns around anymore.  And Light Gun Shooters on PC don't work. With the mouse you can quicker and easier react to where to shoot and what to do and this game is on the same level as Star Wars - Rebel Assault from 1993 which had literally no gameplay, was easy as ♥♥♥♥ and only sold because of the license. Again, over 20 years ago.Anyway, let's go to the game and the next low blow (after declaring Rambo dead and mixing up his birth year with 1946 instead of the correct 1947) to all fans is the fact that nobody looks like their counterparts of the movie. I know it's hard to get the rights to display actors but considering they have a scanned picture of Trautman showing up it boggles my mind that the Trautman in the game itself looks nothing like Richard Crenna and so doesn't Rambo, it looks more like a cosplayer than Stallone. Everybody else looks absolutely nothing like their movie counterparts. Teasle isn't recognizable at all, so i Galt or Zaysen from the third movie.The movies are also quite condensed and changed. First Blood starts as a QTE-heavy battle in the police station, then you kill a ton of cops in the forest, then you're suddenly in the city causing carnage, again the last part doesn't happen in the movie or in the book and several parts that could've been interesting are skipped. Like the cave scene where Rambo fiths against Rats (or bats in the book), that is just skipped.The Movies are cut into several levels after which you get an evaluation of your skills and gain XP which you can use for skills that make your life even more easier (bonus stuff like ""get 5% health per headshot"") and upgrading your weapons to contain more ammo or deal more damage. Though the guns actually don't really feel that different. AK47 and M16 are interchangable and blasting away with an Mac-10 isn't different to firing an AK.First Blood Part 2 follows the same path of replaying scenes from the movie, while deleting some and getting entirely new stuff in. In the movie Rambos boat doesn't get attacked by torpedoes, here you're tasked to shoot them down...with an Ingram. How a Mac-10 found it's way to Vietnam, i don't know, the weapon never even shows up in the movie but here you are shooting down torpedoes with it. Silly. Julia Nickson-Soul was a good looking woman in the movie playing Co-Bao, in the game her name is ""Coo"" and she looks horrendous. Again, it hurts.I stopped playing there to be honest. It wasn't fun at all. I do like Light Gun Shooters, i do like Rail Shooters if they're done good. Rambo III on the Master System is still fun and way better than this abomination here.I also have to mention the sound. Ripping out voice lines from the movies is not a bad idea but mixing them with new lines spoken by other people doesn't work. Even worse in this game the volume is changing, the new dialogue is way louder than the stuff taken from the movies, so i constantly had to work the volume knob on my mixer.Graphically, i already said that nobody resembles the actors in the movies and everything else is extremely outdated. While i don't follow the ""it looks like a PS2 game"" claims because that's wrong, i'd say it's very first generation Xbox 360 graphics and also a bad audio experience.Honestly avoid this game, even if you like Rambo and the movies. Get a Mega Drive and Rambo 3 or a Master System with Rambo - First Blood Part 2 and a Light Phaser and Rambo 3, those are better experiences than this abomination of a game right here."

Show them the American way. Shoot them until they are dead so they learn about peace and freedom the American way"".So no.. Don't buy this game over 50 cent. (at least the trading cards would give you back the money)Just google ""Commando Libya"" for C64 and play that. At least you get to kill Khadafi's children on the bonus stages or the classic (and 100% censored game in Sweden) Raid over Moscow. Raid over Moscow is 100x times better than Rambo and is more true to Rambo's spirit. Imagine a stage in a game where you have a bazooka and your goal is to blow the Kremlin towers up.

,Not Recommended,274130,15666613,"Posted: 3 May, 2015",all,windycornertv,"It seems like I'm the only person that actually read the press release and knew this game was an on rail shooter. Even the description on Steam stresses the fact its a rail shooter on three occasions. Of course people just look at the pretty pictures and assumed it was another first person shooter. I personally love rail shooters and it's such a shame it's becoming a dead genre. So I was really pinning my hopes on Rambo The Video Game, unfortunately the combination of bad game design and lazy production values hold it back from being a fun arcade shooter.Rambo the Video Game recreates the events of the first three films in the franchise. You play as John Rambo, a Vietnam War veteran unable to readjust to normal society and learns the battlefield is the only place he can call home.  The developers have managed to replicate all the key sequences from the movies, while adding a few of their own. The voices for Rambo and Colonel Trautman were taken directly from the movies and were spliced among newly recorded voice overs (comprised mostly of UK actors using a poor excuse for an American accent). The end result is an inconsistent audio mix that comes across as cheap and lazy.The game play is an on rail shooter with a cover system similar to Time Crisis. Unfortunately this so called ""cover"" doesn’t protect you from certain enemies and can easily be destroyed by enemy gunfire. To make matters worst, half of the game is spent standing out in the open with zero protection. A huge problem when reloading your gun turns the player into a sitting duck. This has to be the most frustrating on rail shooter I’ve ever played, in fact the difficulty on the last level spiked so hard, the only way I could finish this bloody game was by adjusting the difficulty to the lowest setting.The developers tried to mix in a couple of ideas from other genres, but they don’t exactly work in the simple on rail shooter. Does every game need to have stealth these days? As well as those bloody quick time events, in fact one whole mission is nothing but quick time events. A testament to the game's lazy design.Now to be fair there are some interesting ideas, including the RPG style upgrade and perk system. You can also disarm enemies by shooting the gun out of their hands and a wrath system where Rambo does his trademark screaming, which allows to gain back some health with every enemy he kills. So that's how he survived the fights in the original films.It took me 3 hours and 6 minutes to finish the story mode and this includes all my failed attempts and watching every cut-scenes. You can play through the missions again to unlock all the weapons and perks. There’s online leader boards and two player co-op. But it still doesn’t hide the fact it’s a really short game.The issues with Rambo The Video Game stem from it trying to do too much with a simple genre. Plus the low production values, terrible quality control and bad graphics are really glaring for a game in 2014 from a non-indie developer. If you’re looking for a good Rambo video game, keep an eye out for the Sega arcade machine from 2008 and leave this one to rot in the hole it deserves to be in."

,Recommended,274130,26608093,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,SixHealthOfFury,"The best video game based on a movie series. Hyperbole aside, the Rambo video game does what most other movie-based video games fail to do; make a game centered on the theme of the material. The choice of making it a rail shooter was often rediculed when this game was first announced and after playing it, I understood the genius behind that decision. Making it a survival RPG like Farcry 3 would have been cool, but would have such slow moments in the story, the emotional impact to Rambo would have been lost. By automating the movement of what the player (and character) was trying to accomplish, the momentum was maintained of being a bad-mother-trucker conflicted with the reality of war. There were several times in the middle of the gameplay where I'd think, ""This is messed up."" as I took in the carnage I was doing during some missions. Not even games labeled as horror give me such a sensation. To keep the first paragraph as short as I can, if you love the movies and want a faithful adaptation, get this game.Since I did my best to glow about how amazing the game is, I'm going to list the negatives now.- Not every scene is exactly what happened in the movies. For purists, it might be a deal breaker but it doesn't really change much of the story.- The quick time events don't do a great job to help players gauge the timing of button presses. I still can't tell if the game difficulty changes the speed and by how much. Almost requires using the auto-succeed perk- 3 out of the 16 default missions are painful to play through. 2 of the missions from memory involve avoiding the cops and not trying to kill them. Problem is that there are so many coming at once to shoot Rambo, they often get shot again as they start to fall down and get killed. The last mission almost requires level grinding with how tough those guys are.- The challenge missions to unlock weapons aren't fun. They unlock in sequence and you can't unlock weapons next in line if you didn't unlock the previous, wasting time for most players. Even worse is the final mission has you using one weapon only, so you can't even use your hard earned rewards where it could help.- The video cutscenes tend to lag. The game plays the highest quality settings for the cutscenes regardless of your own settings, so they will be choppy if your graphics card can't handle it. A real shame- Not stable of a game. Tends to crash every now and then. Thankfully it has crashed at the start of a mission or at the end of one with my data saved in game when I beat the mission.3 out of those 6 complaints are minor, with the cutscene and quick time events being a big enough problem to lower the overall score. The crashes are annoying, but I haven't had the crashes affect the game or my computer and won't dock it for that. If the crash happened mid-level, I'd be furious with how hard some of the missions are.Overall score: 9/10"

Getting 3 stars on a mission ain't always easy 'tho, i recommend upgrading Rambo to the fullest before attempting to 3 star every mission.You go through all the stages 'on rails' (meaning you can't move on your own) shooting bad guys and cops (only disarm the cops because killing them will give you penalty points). Most levels are filled with action from start to finish and other levels are slowed down for a while because of a 'stealth' section where you have to complete annoying quick time events or silently kill enemies with your bow before they spot you and give you a one tap to the face.There's not much to say storywise and i cannot tell you if things are the same in the movies 'cause i haven't seen a single Rambo movie... The game has 4 missions based on the first movie, 7 missions for Rambo II and 5 missions from Rambo III. There's also free DLC that has 3 missions that are quite enjoyable but the last one had unexplainable bad fps for me.I'll recommend a playthrough of this game if you want something simple to blast through."

I dont think it would be worth the original price but as a game around $10 and $1 on sale i think its good. On the harder settings this game is actually pretty difficult for me it doesnt aim assist and the sensitivity is hella high. I think this would have made a good VR game or maybe Wii etc type thing. The movies are all glitchy but the gameplay was smooth. I have not played a rail shooter in a while and to me this was kinda refreshing since the graphics are decent.The enemies all look alike but its kinda funny its almost like an unintended satire on the action genre.

After telling us to knock it off, as the manager was walking away I got to put in my initials at the high score screen and knowing he was jewish I put JEW. I called him back and said ""look at this"" and he called mall security and we ran out of the arcade laughing so hard we thought we were gonna die. lol good times.Considering I am a Rambo superfan, God help those poor people if this game was in the arcades then. If I saw this in the arcade my head would have exploded before I even touched the gun.The gameplay audio is good but cutscene audio is terrible quality and the newly recorded dialogue is some of the worst voice acting I've ever heard. The skill system has like five categories but it makes no sense to not put all your points into toughness and wrath. The game is decent enough fun and other than a couple crashes it moves along well until the last mission where I had to switch the difficulty from medium to easy because they decided to make the level impossible. Enemies suddenly have no-miss aim and you can't pop out of cover for more than half a second without taking massive dmg so all you can do is pop up and fire a few shots then hide, dozens and dozens of times. Plus for whatever reason they decided to make enemies in the last mission say ""he's a man, not a god!"" over and over again endlessly and it's incredibly annoying.

That being said - the game is a RAIL SHOOTER not a 1st person shooter and you can see the graphics in the gameplay videos and screenshots on the store page. So complaining about the graphics and how it is a rail shooter is really silly.Regardless, the game is actually pretty fun and short since it's a really straightforward arcade style rail shooter that recreates the major scenes from the first three Rambo films. It makes my inner nine year old oh so happy.I tried playing the game with a wireless Xbox 360 controller and with keyboard/mouse. It is immensely easier with a mouse and I do not recommend trying to play this game with a controller. Aiming with a joystick on a controller is really sluggish, especially with the 'aim assisting' feature. Just remember to crank up the sensitivity regardless of which control mechanism you use.I enjoy this game but I can only recommend it to players who like rail shooters and/or are big fans of the Rambo films.

Story runs about three hours.  Replayable if you really like rail-shooters.  Look at some gameplay footage if you're not sure.  Wasn't worth $40, but it absolutely worth the new $13 price.  Controller works alright, coop is fun, and the Baker Team DLC adds a few more levels and weapons, all of which are fun.A delightful arcade rail-shooter!All but one review that I read for this game prior to buying it were negative.  Of all those negative reviews, about half were people saying ""IT SUCKS DON'T BUY IT,"" or simply shouting profanities at the developer, which is less than helpful.  The other half was mostly long winded ways of saying ""I am angry because this game is exactly what it says it is and not what I want it to be,"" that is an arcade rail-shooter that plays like an arcade rail-shooter and not like a normal PC/console FPS.  The other few reviews were people complaining about technical issues which will vary from machine to machine.  The one positive review that I read started as negative until the guy played it a bit more and realised, ""Hey, this isn't half bad.  Heck it's actually fun!""While not perfect, Rambo The Video Game is far from bad.  It provides a good challenge with fun gameplay for about three hours or so.  You get to use a nice variety of weapons that all differ in their own way slightly and you can unlock them all to use in any mission by completing challenges you unlock by progressing through the game.  There's an active reload system similar to Gears of War only much faster, and if you jam your gun at the wrong time you're as good as dead unless you quickly switch to your secondary weapon.  The cover system works pretty well and the game is smart enough to not let you sit there all day by either making your cover destroyable or having a grenadier throw grenades at you.  Managing your rage meter and when to unleash it to restore your health isn't terribly hard to figure out as long as you keep an eye on your health.  The vehicle segments and stealth segments with the bow are lots of fun and the explosive arrows are about as fun as you'd hope they would be.Overall I'd probably give the game at least 7/10.  I didn't experience any bugs or technical issues.  I had a lot of fun with the single player and I plan on trying out coop with my friend this weekend.  If I remember to then I'll add on to my review for coop and using a controller to play instead of the mouse.  My only real complaint about the game is that the quick time events are really hard to judge (which isn't really an issue because you can get a perk that prevets you from dying if you fail one).I would reccomend buying the game on sale, as it isn't really worth $40.  I got it for $10 myself and I'm happy with what I got for that.  If you intend on buying this game, make sure that you're expecting an arcade rail-shooter and not a Triple A FPS.  The game has about the same production value as the actual Rambo arcade light gun game (which is also really fun).  The graphics LOOK like an arcade rail-shooter.  If you're not sure then watch some gameplay footage.EDIT: I tried out playing with an XBox 360 controller.  It's certainly playable, albeit a bit awkward at first.  When playing with the controller there's a bit of autoaim to help you out, which doesn't feel intrusive and is actually helpful.  Mouse and keyboard is probably the better option for most people, but in the end it comes down to preference.DOUBLE EDIT: Tried out local coop.  Plays just like single player only you have TWO guns shooting at once!  You share health and rage which works just fine.  If you play local coop I reccomend going into the display settings and turning off display weapons to make it a bit less cluttered and confusing.TRIPLE EDIT: The Baker Team DLC is pretty fun too.  Voice acting is as corny as ever.  Adds a few more challenges and weapons.  The levels provide a decent challenge and if you like the rest of the game (which you should) then you'll enjoy the three new Baker Team levels as well.  Plus it was free, so that's always awesome.  On the subject of price.  I would say the game is worth the new $13 price tag."

If you come into it knowing It's an arcadey on rails shooter, then you're going to have an amazingly fun time. It has a very deep scoring system, with challenging difficulty. If you're a huge fan of rail shooters, you can sink a whole lot of hours into this one. I have two bigger issues with this game though. The first are the quick time events. It's really unneeded and It feels laggy. I press the proper button in what I think is the perfect timing, but I miss it completely and fail the section. I should note that you have the option to select a perk that hits all the QTE's perfect and you just sit back and watch. I haven't tried this yet, but it's pretty neccessary in the harder difficulties it seems. The second issue is the fact that you may have one or two enemies on the screen, and they won't be shooting you..but you'll be taking damage. It's not a huge deal i guess, but it's really annoying and it shows lazy programming. So where are we? At $40, it does seem pretty steep for a 2-3 hour experience, but If you're a fan of rail shooters, you'll get plenty of your money's worth with the scoring system and replayability.At $10 - Instant buy for fans of rambo or rail shootersAt $40 - Serious consideration..worth it, but not to the majority of the population!Bottom Line: I love this game, and don't listen to all the haters.

Try to buy it when there is a discount.  I got this game a price of $9.99 and I think it totally worth it."

But I go on youtube and watch reviews on it and it's voted, 2/10, 3/10 by reviewers. It's not THAT godawful.If I'm being totally honest, I kinda enjoyed, somewhat. It has some stages that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me the ♥♥♥♥ off, namely the last stage. ♥♥♥♥. THAT. But other than that, it somewhat succeeded design-wise. Not hard, somewhat easy at times, but it mostly does it correctly. The guns all feel the same, like a goddamn paintball gun. The only change is the rate of fire and magazine size. It has a somewhat interesting reloading mechanic, despite what people say. It's not realistic, but it's ♥♥♥♥in' Rambo for gods sake. Anyway, the textures, animations, and just graphics in general are♥♥♥♥♥♥ but outside of custscenes it's negligible I suppose. Though strangely, out of all models, Rambo seems to be the worst looking one.The story is like the first three films, though some small differences. For example, at one point Rambo shoots 200 or so cops, which.. y'know.. didn't happen.It has a wrath mode, which is okay i guess. It puts you in slow-mo, and highlights all enemies. In wrath mode, each enemy you kill gains you health. The audio though.. that's the worst part. It's literally the voices ripped straight from the movie. And it's obvious, horribly horribly obvious.Other than that, it's an incredibly mediocre first person cover shooter. It's playable, but not breaking and new ground or anything, despite being a ♥♥♥♥ing cover shooter made in 2014. Overall its maybe.. 5/10. Then again, I picked it up for 10 bucks, DO NOT pay more for that.♥♥♥♥♥♥ unless you're either a big fan of cover shooters or a big fan of Rambo don't even bother with it."

First off this is NOT an Epic Story Lined RPG/FPS MEGA MILL Game .... yeah, and I dont think it was suppose to be either. If you have watched the Rambo movies then you should have a pretty good idea of what to expect, minimal ... cheesy dialogue and excessive explosions. What you do in this game is play all the action scenes from the first 3 movies (4th film is not in this, though I wish it were). It IS a Rail Shooter, to those that may want more of an example, this game reminds me a lot of the Movie based rail games back in the late 80s and early 90s, I remember playing an Arcade version of Star Wars that was the same way.You still have to take cover and shoot and there are some QTEs, you can get a perk in the game to make QTEs impossible to fail but you wont get any points for not doing them, with or with out the perk. A lot of peps hate that the perk is in there, my advice, if the idea of not being able to fail a QTE bothers you, then dont use the damn perk, its very simple. The combat is fun, the QTEs are fun and ... well your playing as Rambo and blowing everything in the game world up ... what else do you want out of a Rambo game?Is it perfect? Of course not, but its fun.Again, your gonna see and hear a lot of hate for this game and some peps are very good at hating everything, so I suggest you watch game play videos online with no commentary, come in to this game with out looking for the bad, because if that is your focus, then your gonna find it, dont care what game your playing.If you like Rambo, and you want to play as Rambo and blow things up ... well pretty much everything up, then I can not recommend it more. If you dont like Rambo, rail shooters, the 80s or playing a game just for the fun of it, then stay away. This is not for you. To everyone else, have a blast :D"

,Recommended,274130,9214310,"Posted: 21 February, 2014",all,Johnny Luchador,"I purchased this game thinking it was Over the Top. I was terribly wrong. I was expecting Arm Wrestling, when instead I get giant Sly Bobble head with a Perm. My Mind was blown, not only did it have everything I've ever wanted in a video game, but it also gave me the freedom to be a real american. I made up words to the theme song, I screamed them for an hour until I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off my wife and she went up stairs. But its okay, she doesn't even know what a Rambo is. Now, I'm killing them damn VietKongs and blasting Hulk Hogans Real American theme while smoking Marlboro Reds, while a bald eagle sits purched on top my laptop.Sure, this game probably should have come out in like 2004, but hot damn it gets me goin. I put a bunch of peanuts in a burlap sack and started swinging the sack around like I was Thundar the Barbarian. You have to realize, it's not about the game, it's about living Rambo, being one with Rambo, having Rambo as your spirit animal. Once you accomplish this, you'll be able to go into any grocery store, walk down the cereal aisle, open random boxes of Captain Crunch, and just pour the♥♥♥♥♥♥in your mouth like it's the pure tears from angels.This game is for only Hard Mukkas, straight off the streets of Compton. Are you a bad enough dude, to play RAMBO?!GOTY 30/10 Rambos.UPDATE: So I spent 2 hours, disarming cops and not killing them for 1 prize. A Shotgun. And might I say, Rambo with a shotgun is one of the greatest achievements we as gamers could ever be granted. You might be asking yourself, would Rambo with a shotgun be worth the money? No, absolutely not. Not one bit. I mean I could have used those 2 hours of my life to Fist Fight this damn gigantic♥♥♥♥♥dog that randomly stands upright and walks through my backyard. I mean it's probably some crazy man that walks on 4's then just randomly stands up. Never the less, by gaining Shotgun ablitiles, Rambo becomes so overpowered that nothing can stop him. Helicopters, pshhh, they're like horse flys to Rambo, he just uses his mighty boomstick and cast them down straight to the dephs of hell. During such an adventure, Meatloaf, the singer, starts tearing his shirt open exposing his jolly old self while singing Paradise by a Dashboard Light.  It's a real bronx Jeer!Some have also been asking, do you write reviews for anyone? I did at one point for a major site place, that I'm not aloud to mention due to fancy smancy lawyer junk. I don't have a youtube, but I do cast on twitch regularly. Formly of the twitch channel with over 100 mil views, but now I live over attwitch.tv/videogamecircusMaybe I'll see some of you beautiful people there."

Only real negatives would be the graphics and the QTEs, the latter of which are easily remedied with a perk. It's a lot of old school fun trying to beat your own high scores and getting to the top of the leaderboards."
,Recommended,274130,9256043,"Posted: 25 February, 2014",all,SuperSixBravo,"Firstly put aside all the negative reviews and forum posts. Yes the game has some serious issues and the some of the game play mechanics are a bit of pain.Taking all of the above into consideration there is actually quite a good game in there. Yes its on rails, but its not that bad. There is quite a lot of depth to the game that some reviews did not mention because they were too busy telling us how bad everything is.The cover system whilst taken right out of the likes of time crisis etc, does some quite good things. Hide behind a box and the enemy will shoot the box out leaving you with no cover, there is also quite a good system where by when being shot at by multiple enemies its advisable to wait for them to reload before you pop out of cover and take them down. Of course you can't also wait because  your cover may be getting destroyed affording you no time to wait for reloads.You can also make choices such as killing or disarming cops rather than killing them, Totalbiscuit touched on this all be it he mocked it at least he noticed it so good on him.The graphics whilst not earth shattering are not of PS2 quality and If you think that then please go back and play a PS2. There is lots of destruction especially when you get to fly the helicopter and ""Blow Stuff Up"" the buildings all blow up nicely and in a seemingly non scripted way and catch fire, enemies lose limbs and its very satisfying cutting them down with the guns mounted on the helicopter.QTE's well what can you say? they do have a place in some games and I sense that they were added because of the on rails type of game play. Again some reviews have mentioned the perk you can get where you can avoid doing the QTE's as the game will do them for you, but what they did not mention was, that  whilst the game does them for you, it does them in the worst way possible as in you will never get a perfect timing hit. You can also still do the QTE's yourself with the perk and get them perfect often affording you a little more time to shoot the incoming nade or take up cover quicker or just avoid a mortar but you will still lose some life. So yes whilst the perk will do the QTE's for you its really only just getting you through the game its far more beneficial to do them yourself.The game is also fairly hard in some places, sometimes due to bad design but more often its because its just hard. Of course the better you are the less hard it will be for you, I find it hard at times so this is just my observation.If you like time crisis, good old fashioned guns and action with no need to worry about your path and clear objectives then you will like this game. There are lots of little things you will notice and think ah ok thats quite cool.I am enjoying this game and I also think there is a lot of replay value to it. For people wanting a light gun experience you can use a wii controller but this is not supported by the game, however google is your friend.Its not that bad IMHO if you get to try it you will be surprised."

,Recommended,274130,9223274,"Posted: 22 February, 2014",all,Jewbacca,"This game gets a lot of hate, but for what it is I think it is pretty great (perhaps because I may be one of the biggest Rambo fanboys in the entire universe.) Like many others I feel like the video shown on steam is about as misleading as an Army recruiter, but if you take a step back from all of your hatred for the game being a rail shooter you can take the opppurtunity to note that this type of game could be the beginning of an actually badass Rambo game that plays like Far Cry 3 does (please baby jesus let that happen) I will note the pros and cons in this game. Pros- Fun to play, Satisfying kills, Lots of different weapons, cool perks and skills, interesting twist on the movies, the ways you recover health is fun (especially the headshot perk), you get to slay a lot of bad guys, the weapons have huge magazine capacity, the quick time events are exciting (usually), decent enough graphics for a video game based of a movie (those usually suck much worse). and obviously this is the only Rambo game out there so shout out to the guys who actually made this little boys dreams come true (even though its not as good as it could be its a start). The Cons- Its a rail shooter. Its a rail shooter. Its a rail shooter. some of the QTE are awkward and some points which would be perfect for QTE do not have them, For some reason I killed some vietnamese dudes in Afghanistan? Most of the bad guys are exactly the same character models, same weapons, and same deaths; it makes the game rather repetive and I have to stoop and take a break. The cover system can sometimes be awkward (and pointless). Obviously not worth 39.99... more like 4.99-7.99. They take audio from the movie, which is great, but it sounds like♥♥♥♥♥and is not consistant with the rest of the games audio. It seems like they were really trying to make the game consistant with the movies, but when it comes to the characters they royally f**ked up. Rambo himself is not really up to par, Teasel and Colonel Ruskie man is completely different, neither of them had facial hair in the movie, why add it for the game??? WTF? Co Bao looks like an emo anime girl teenager, Gault is bald.. I mean seriously? At least try not to♥♥♥♥♥♥on my favorite movies ever. and last of my cons is that they left out some of the most memorable scenes from the movies, like when Rambo finds his way out of the caves in the first movie, when he gets hung up in the second, stick fighting in the third (although by this point in the game they have butchered the transition between First Blood Part 2 and Rambo 3). I think that this game would be much better if they had done it correctly as an open world RPG action/adventure like Far Cry 3, that plays through First Blood (Bonus points if it goes by the book, which is 100x better than the movie btw) FB pt 2, Rambo 3 and Rambo. I would play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of that. Also, one more con that doesn't really have anything to do with the gameplay, but because I myself and in the Army, they really f**ked up the uniforms in the cinematic sequences. Those Berets look like a bag of♥♥♥♥♥and the soldiers are all wearing officer uniforms without ranks on the shoulder boards. The nameplates are blank, the medals and ribbons are decently placed, but could have been done better. Also if the soldier is wearing the special forces patch he should be wearing a green beret, not a black beret. Just a little sidebar that annoys me in videogames and movies."

Fans of the Rambo films will no doubt get a kick outof this game. The voice acting are actual clips from the movies, which can be good or baddepending on your opinion. The sound effects average, and the controls take some gettingused to. I find the game to be fairly difficult even on the easiest setting, but it get's easieronce you get the hang of the controls and understand how to best you ""wrath mode"".""Wrath mode"" is a special state you can enhance Rambo with once you have earned it.Killing enemies during ""wrath mode"" is the only way for Rambo to regain health duringmissions.
