,Recommended,274190,32311927,Posted: 10 June,all,Alejandro4891,"Broforce is a hysterical and fun pixel based shoot 'em up sidescroller. I have to emphasize just how funny this game is, it doesn't take itself seriously at all and it's one of the funniest games I've played in a long time, there's plenty of laugh out loud moments. Besides consisting of well-done sophomoric humor/parodies, there are also instances of satire found within the game. One example would be how your commander says ""the people from this country, look, speak, and act differently to us. Let's move fast, bros!"". I'm sure most of you have encountered similar or possibly the same exact saying elsewhere, but it fits perfectly well in this game.In Broforce you frenetically wreak fierce havoc upon terrorists and two enemies that come out of left field much later in the game. This frantic gameplay style mixed with destructible environments leads to very exciting moments. Not only is the gameplay exciting due to the mayhem that you can possibly create, it could also be used as a viable strategy to get through tough situations.Speaking of tough situations, there are plenty of moments that will test your skills. Many people dislike tough video games for many reasons, but Broforce offers tough but fair gameplay. Despite being fair, there are many levels in which you will have to trial and error your way through it, you will die a lot. The deaths aren't really a problem as long as you have more lives. After you die you'll essentially respawn as a different character in the exact spot where you died, which is especially helpful during boss fights.The boss fights in Broforce are interesting not only because of the variety of bosses that are encountered, but also because they all vary in difficulty. Some are quite easy to get through and some are frustratingly hard, it all depends on your playstyle and which character you feel best fits the situation.You mainly play as a multitude of characters that are throwback references to popular 80s/90s action movie stars with the occasional 2000s hero thrown in. I honestly don't know how many characters there are, but it's interesting just how many playstyles are offered. Some of these characters consist of Rambo, The Terminator, Dirty Harry, Neo/Mr. Anderson and Indiana Jones. The funny gimmick in regards to the names of these characters is that their names are altered to fit ""bro"". For example, Rambo is Rambro and Leon the professional is simply ""The Brofessional"".Though many may view this game as infantile, playing through this game will show you just how well thought out it truly was, based on the overall gameplay. I've played through other games that include popular characters from movies/cartoons, but it's obvious that much thought didn't go into truly depicting how the character is in their source material. The characters in Broforce all have three attacks, a main attack, a special attack, and a melee attack. As previously stated, all of the attacks fit well with the character that's being used. For example, Dirty Harry uses a powerful revolver like he does in the movies, the terminator uses a large/recoil heavy minigun, and Indiana Jones uses a whip along with a piercing revolver.Despite having a multitude of characters in this game, they're essentially chosen at random, it's a bit of a double-edged sword. At the start of the levels you don't know who you'll play as and as you save imprisoned ""bros"", the equivalent of getting an extra life, your character is switched and you begin to play as another. There are pros and cons when it comes to this, do you ignore the necessary extra life, or do you stick to the character that you're currently playing as because you favor their playstyle? That is one question you'll most likely ask yourself while playing through this game.Overall, I greatly enjoyed Broforce due to its highly entertaining gameplay and humorous story. I give it a 4.5/5 and I recommend it if you're a fan of pixel based side-scrolling shoot 'em ups."
,Recommended,274190,19857942,"Posted: 22 December, 2015",all,Colonel Mustache,"You can literally punch Satan so hard he explodes.I could stop the review right there, 'nuff said. Except no, there's so much more to it than that. Broforce is more than just a one-track gag, it's a love letter to 80s and 90s action heroes wrapped in an homage to Contra, Metal Slug, and with a little Worms for good measure.At first glance, the game may come off as simply a novelty. But they didn't just take a generic character, slap the name Rambro on him, and call it good. Every single character in the cast of over 30 has a great deal of love and detail worked into them. Each character has a unique primary attack, a special attack, and a melee attack. Rambro has a trusty machine gun and versatile grenades, whereas Bro Heart has a claymore and the ability to scare enemies by screaming at the top of his lungs. If a character is played by Van Damme, you better believe he can deliver split kicks to terrorists' faces.Therein lies Broforce's ""gimmick:"" You start each level with a single life and a random Bro you've unlocked so far. Freeing a Bro trapped in a cage will grant you another life, while also swapping your character to another random Bro. Thus, you have to decide between keeping your current character, or getting the extra life. It's a simple mechanic when you get down to it, but it adds a huge amount of replay value to the game - You'll rarely beat a given level the same way twice.Each character, given that they're completely different, has their own upsides and downsides. Brocketeer may lack the raw firepower of the other characters, but his jetpack lets him rocket punch dudes and make crazy jumps. MacBrover's dynamite may be less straightforward than a gun, but timed right can cause absolute carnage. Of the gigantic cast, there are maybe one or two characters I try to avoid, and even they can get the job done.Part of Broforce's charm is in its sheer hilarity and the number of things you can do. I once threw a guy at another guy, killing them both...The second guy was a suicide bomber, however, so he exploded, sending a dog flying through a door, which killed another guy as it opened. You can kill a guy by hitting him in the head with a flash grenade. You can kill Satan by throwing another Satan at him (the latter Satan also dies). You can throw your claymore, which decapitates everyone in its path. Someone out of range may try to shoot you, but your claymore, now stuck in the ground, will reflect the bullets right back into his evil face.That's not to say Broforce is completely without faults. In all the carnage and chain-reactions of destruction, it is pretty easy to die, especially when most characters die from a single shot. There are definitely some deaths that feel like they were unavoidable, such as an explosive barrel falling on top of me from offscreen. The reason why I completely forgive this, however, is because of how fun the whole thing is. Death usually has little consequence, so an annoying moment here and there are easily remedied by the barrels of laughs in between. It's definitely a game that's more fun than frustrating. As someone who's not particularly hardcore, the game has never been so frustrating that it made me want to stop playing.Multiplayer makes the game even more fun and more chaotic. Depending on the level, adding more players can make the game easier (because of the multiplied firepower) or harder (because of the added chaos and thin-spread lives), but almost always makes it more fun. You can high five one another (triggering slow motion), flex together, and if you really want you can drop the rescue chopper on their head. Everyone starts the next level with exactly 1 life anyway, so messing around at the end of the level is surprisingly consequence-free.Along with the main levels, there are challenge levels, which when completed unlock powerups in the rest of the game. You can call in an ""All-American Supply Drop"", aka a nearly-invincible mech with the american flag plastered on in place of a windshield, or take somesteroiVITAMINSthat let you throw dudes like Superman and scare enemies with your homoerotic grunts.At the end of the level, after you've shot Satan in the face (or punched him so hard he exploded, or thrown him off a cliff, or beaten him to death with his own minions, or scared him so hard he jumped to his death), you (and your friends, on the rare occasion you coordinate everyone's jumps correctly) board the rescue chopper and fly off into the distance, as a rockin' victory theme plays and the entire level explodes for no discernible reason.That's a perfect image to sum up Broforce: Over the top, ridiculous, nonsensicalfun. It would have been very easy for the developers to take the game's concept and turn it into a one-track novelty that doesn't actually amount to much. But Free Lives is the prime example of what a game developer should be. They didn't just put time, money, and effort into this game: They putloveinto it. They clearly weren't just trying to make a quick buck, they made Broforce because they loved the things they based it off and wanted to share that with other people. Broforce is a game that's a great idea in theory and an even better idea in reality. It is, quite simply, one of the greatest games I've ever played.Play this ♥♥♥♥ing game."

,Recommended,274190,14199601,"Posted: 27 January, 2015",all,Comrade St. Nikolai,"BROFORCE (you have to say it as a growling shout, or you don't do the game justice) is a game about action heroes. Actual action heroes, as it turns out. Oh, sure, the names change. But with a list of playable characters that includes ""Rambro"", ""MacBrover"", and ""B.A. Broracus"" I think we all know the score.Don't worry, I'm going to try to steer clear of mentioning any but the earlier-unlocked characters in this review. For the best effect, I recommend not spoiling the list for yourself. One of the most fun parts of Broforce is the anticipation of the next unlock, and witnessing the reveal to the sound of the character's name being shouted by the thoroughly-manly announcer.BROFORCE is a run-and-gun platformer. The game moves briskly, but not so much so that you can't keep up. It's a nice speed that feels appropriately actiony without feeling unfair. Controls are slick and responsive. Deaths will usually be your own fault, and are accompanied by a noticeable lack of frustration. We all know that feel, right? You die in a game, have to start the level over, and curse either very loudly or under your breath, depending on who's nearby. In Broforce, I don't have that. The game plays so well, the action so entertaining, that having to try again only serves to prolong the enjoyable experience.The environments are almost entirely destructable. The effect reminds me of Worms, but with a little more detail to it. When you destroy some dirt, a block or two above it may also crumble. Destroying the ground underneath of a support will cause the support to fall apart piece-by-piece. Blocks in ruins will fall and crush anyone underneath. You can blow up explosive barrels, of course, but you can also send propane canisters rocketing satisfyingly into anything in their path, pushing enemies through walls and then detonating after a short distance. Think the conclusion to the final battle in the film version ofKick♥♥♥♥♥/spoiler].The main draw of the game is the still-growing number of Bros to play as. You don't get to pick your Bro, they're randomly chosen from the ones you've unlocked so far. Unlock more Bros by rescuing more P.O.W. Bros from cages through the game. Each Bro rescued gives you an extra life and turns you into a new Bro. The new Bros are unlocked after you do this certain numbers of times. At the moment, I believe it takes some 300 rescues to catch 'em all.The other way to change Bros is to die (and have at least one life remaining). I've seen people complain about not being able to choose who to play as, but I stand by the current model. It's the same sort of thing I really enjoyed about the way Bastion forced you to use each new weapon for a short time. You can't just pick one thing that works and run through the entire game using only that thing. It would get boring before you were even halfway through, and there's not a chance you wouldn't blame the game for that. Having to use each one, whether you like it or not, allows you come to appreciate the pros and cons of each instead of ignoring the new thing to stick with your favorite.The Bro lottery simply means that you have to develop your tactics on the fly. Let me tell you, I hated MacBrover at first. Instead of firing bullets at everything, you now have to throw timed explosives at them. And his special is just a remote-detonated version of that. What a rip-off, right? WRONG. SHUT UP. YOU SIT BACK DOWN AND YOU LISTEN, GODDAMN YOU. Turns out, MacBrover is pretty much the bane ofmostbosses. Most Bros can only shoot straight ahead. They may have a special that lets them lob a grenade or whatever. But those specials are limited, and the grenade will honestly probably just bounce a safe distance away from your target, anyways. MacBrover's explosives will detonate more-or-less exactly where you drop them. And since it's his main attack, he can do thisinfinitely. Find a nice perch and unload, man. Plus, I mean, once you get the hang of it, dropping explosives so that they stick to the general rabble is pretty fun, too.Now imagine an entire game, FILLED with Bros, all of whom have their pros and cons just like MacBrover. Now imagine that you never know who you'll be playing as next. Getting somebody who meshes well with the situation at hand means plowing through that situation while your heart drips with physical glee. Getting somebody who isn't perfect for the situation means being confronted with a fun challenge where you have to work your way through it like a man.There's a good variety to your enemies, as well. You'll kill loads and loads of the basic mooks, but you have big guys, dogs, bomb-tossers, and more. Each of the bosses manages to be pretty unique. I mean, you know, they're mostly just giant death machines that fire big guns at you. But they move differently, fire different types of big guns in different trajectories... look, point is, you won't get bored of the enemy variety, alright?BROFOOOORCE is still in Early Access, meaning you can expect loads more content in the future. At the moment, one playthrough will probably run you maybe 3-5 hours. The game's enough fun, though, that you shouldn't be surprised if you play it all over again once you're done. Maybe in co-op, this time. The Steam Workshop will extend the length of the gamequitea bit. Plus the new Alien campaign (inspired by the Alien series of films) is only just around the corner, and that'll help. New Bros come out now and then, and the devs still have more ideas up their sleeves. You shouldn't be afraid of the ""Early Access"" label on this one. You'll get your money's worth.I mentioned co-op. There are actually several multiplayer modes. Co-op is the main one. At the moment, online co-op can be a little laggy at times. It's not perfect. It's not terrible either, though. I've played through the full campaign with a friend, and while there were times where the effects of my friend's actions would play out before they actually performed those actions (often resulting in everything turning into sudden explosions and chaos so that I quickly lost track of what was going on, and usually died as a result), as I said, we didfinishthe campaign, and the majority of that time consisted of both ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.There is an issue with the way the online game treats things like the local game, however. Even online, the screens tries to keep everyone in it at once. If it fails, then it will focus on one person, meaning that the other player can't really see what they're doing. 98% of the time, this isn't a problem. But there was one boss that moves vertically that really tripped us up. My strategy is to climb the boss as quickly as possible. My friend's strategy is to not do that. He immediately finds himself offscreen, dead, and waiting for me to ride the boss to death or success.I'll probably update this review every now and then until the game is out, and then I may or may not rewrite it to reflect the final product. If you don't see anything after this paragraph, then the former hasn't happened, yet. If you're even reading this paragraph, then the latter hasn't happened, yet. Anyways, get some BROFORCE, bro!"

,Recommended,274190,18802875,"Posted: 31 October, 2015",all,somebody336,"Broforce is a 2D Run and Gun game where you are tasked with bringing freedom to the entire world. At least that is what they claim we are doing, as we blow enemy hideouts to smithereens and fly off into the sunset. To accomplish this we are given control of “Bros” which are all parody characters out of popular films such as Rambro, Bro Hard and Bronan the Brobarian. As you can no doubt tell, this is very much a tongue in cheek type of game. Broforce is centered around fast gameplay, epic guitar riffs and destruction above all else and has very little story to speak of. You and up to three friends can join in on the carnage via drop in, drop out online or local coop to deliver fiery freedom to terrorists. Starting off the game you will have the choice of either picking Campaign or Arcade Mode. They are mostly the same except campaign mode gives you an overworld while arcade is just back to back missions. Then you will be given the choice of normal and hard difficulty. It is suggested to start on normal since hard has faster rates of fire, more enemies and placements designed to annoy you.At the start of each mission you are given a random Bro that you have unlocked and must make your way throughout the levels saving new Bros for extra lives. Bros all play differently from one another and each have special attacks. For example one bro may only have his fists and be able to send projectiles back at enemies, while another bro throws dynamite and is able to attract enemies via a cooked turkey with dynamite stuffed into it. There are also differences in speed, strength and range between them, so every Bro requires their own play-style, which makes the repetition in this game feel very minimal. To unlock more characters you have to a certain amount of Bros from their cages. The random nature in which you are given Bros is a double edged sword. On one hand you will not be able to rely on the character you are best at and only play as them throughout, but on the other hand some Bros are just not equipped for the task at hand, which will cause you to die until you are given a Bro more suited to the situation. You can retry a mission as many times as you like so it is a minor issue. Unless you are playing on IronBro mode, a permadeath mode that is unlocked later in the game and makes it so each Bro can live only once, once you lose all Bros it's game over.To defend yourself you will have melee, ranged and special attacks. Melee and ranged can be used indefinitely while special attacks usage amount varies from character to character. Strangely enough you can only shoot horizontally, so any enemy above or below you is untouchable via weapon fire until they are on the same plane as you. That is unless you get clever with explosives or special attacks to kill them before they know what hit them. The problem with simply jumping below is that enemies have far greater range than most Bros do, so you have to get in rather close to shoot them. Since you die in a single hit that can be an unnecessarily risky move. This game does require a decent amount of foresight before going in guns blazing. You have to consider if there may be enemies hiding in the grass, if you can take out the enemies before they fire at you and shoot an explosive near you, or if it would simply be better if you punch through a wall and make your own path. There is a pleasant amount to consider before making your move and makes it all the more sweeter when you proudly stand alone in an environment torn apart by an intense battle. That is the perfect time to use the button dedicated to flexing your muscles.Enemies have quite a bit of variety to them and range from dogs, suicide bombers and even supernatural enemies later on. They all have different means of attack and some are able to take a lot of damage. Terrorists have a certain room in which they will infinitely respawn until you destroy the ground under that door, causing them to all fall to their deaths. Sadly, AI is terrible in this game and enemies are very likely to be the cause of their own deaths. If you are spotted the enemy will just stand there and shoot at the direction he last saw you, over and over again until you kill him. The difficulty comes from the traps, enemy numbers and camera which you have no control over. Once you kill an enemy its corpse will provide cover to his friends behind it until you gib it with a few bullets, while enemy bullets can conveniently pass through the body. The camera is far too zoomed in, causing you to be killed by an enemy that was out of view or getting explosives dropped on your head that you had no way of knowing where there on occasions.You will also face multiple vehicles like mechs, helicopters and trucks that spawn enemies from it. Out of all the vehicles you can only hijack the mechs by standing on it and pressing the melee button.  These deal some serious damage to everything it comes across, though its ability to move around is based on a very small fuel supply, so it won't last too long. Your main threats will be the crazy bosses in this game.  The amount of destruction they all cause is staggering and it is a joy to take these down. Some will not just die by shooting at it and will require some outside the box thinking. The overall amount of destruction you will see in this game is truly impressive. Nearly anything can be destroyed and the levels usually end up looking like the planet is imploding in on itself. The only things which can't be destroyed is the ground surrounding the American flag which is used as a respawn point. There is quite a bit of levels to play through on the campaign/arcade. It keeps getting crazier and crazier the further in you go until you are eventually fighting on American soil. What little dialogue there is, is delivered via text and adds nothing to the game. The only difference in campaign mode is the over-world I previously mentioned, where you can fly around and run into seagulls because why not, as well as be able to choose which levels to take on first at times.To top it off this game supports custom maps via Steam workshop. These can also be played with friends and are just as enjoyable as the ones found in the main game. They can be downloaded right from in game and can also be saved so you can play them offline. These offer much more value to the game and are quite a few of them already. Great music is something Broforce also has, especially that final ending theme song. With its fast paced gameplay, considerable difference between Bros and various ways to tackle levels, it offers plenty of replay value even without the user made content. Its AI is unimpressive to say the least but there is a ton of fun to be had mowing them down in various ways. All levels are perfectly playable if you end up doing it solo and may even be preferable, so you know exactly what is going on, which can be pretty hard when you have three others blowing up the map. At the end of the day this is a great game that plays like a mix of Metal Slug and an extreme version of Dig Dug.  For those still unsure I highly recommend checking out the free gameThe Expendabrosto get a taste of what is on offer.

The player must fight through the destroyable world and little brown resistance, in order to reach the end, and kill satan himself, before jumping onto a helicopter with explosions behind you.With over 20 playable “Bros” to pick from, all coming from movies or TV in the 80s or 90s, will make any action movie fan wet themselves with nostalgia. Each character has their own special attack and primary weapon, making each one a new experience. “Bros” are unlocked by rescuing a certain number of POW’s; also doubling as lives for the player. Each time a player re-spawns, a new random unlocked character is selected, changing the play style.One major point about the game everyone should be aware of, is the player only has 1 life point. Falling too far, or catching any bullet, will kill you. Thankfully, the enemies have a slow reaction time, and like to shoot very slow bullets; fast enough to kill you, but slow enough to jump out of the way of. The enemy's range from, massive minigun guys, to dogs, to tanks, to typical tanned jungle dwellers. The ingame environment is 90% destroyable, excluding some checkpoints and the end bit.BroForce does some things right.The destroyable word adds more fun into the gameThe multiplayer is fantasticThe characters are fun to playBroForce doesn't take itself seriouslyEach special ability is either useful or funny in some wayMaintains a proper difficulty curveHas a level editorVery nostalgicYou get to kill satanBroForce does some things wrongThe levels editor is sometimes buggyHard to play multiplayer with randomsRepetitiveStill buggySome characters are almost uselessLacks playing cards and achievementsAll in all BroForce isn't a wonderful game, that being said, it is stupid fun and is damn good. Players can kill many hours blowing things and people up, whether you're American or not. The $16.99(CAD) price tag just isn't justifiable. If its on sale, or you really want to play with friends, pick it up"

Evil must be Americanized, and that's all there is to it.Broforce is a pillar of unprecidented fun and action that is hard to find in modern couch co-op games. Currently in the world of PC gaming, not too many titles exist that offer this kind of instant action and variety in a local 1-4 player setting. Broforce in particular is unique, in that really anyone can jump in and figure out how to play instantly. Blow up bad guys and the landcapes they terrorize, with a huge variety of unique action heroes from all the classic action movies you grew up watching.Broforce is well optimized. It looks and plays great on a decent tv in big picture mode.The action is non stop. The blood and gore is over the top. The gameplay gets heavier and more difficult as you progress. The variety in gameplay changes on a whim as you blast through evil and rescue more Bros. Best of all, there is no story or narrative to skip through: just jump in and play over some hi-fives and a 12 pack with your friends. If you have no friends, you can still have fun playing single player, or join a session online.I've played all the AAA titles, I've bought into the hype of overpriced games that never delivered. Broforce is one of the only games in my huge library that I expect to continue playing for the foreseeable future with my friends and family. The entertainment value you get here for $15.00 is just staggering.Also worth noting, my wife never played video games in the six years we've been together. She probably has most of the over 100 hours already in this game at the time of writing. The fact that she is now obsessed with this game means that anyone can play this and have fun.A must buy for anyone who considers themselves a gamer at any level of enthusiasm."

There's a lot of bang for the buck, it requires little HD space, plays almost completely without bugs (almost? - I didn't discover any so far) and has a really nice atmosphere to the 80's kind of action punch hard, shoot fast, blow up, die hard hero.You'll find old friends like Brobocop, Broman the Barbarian and other Snake Plisskin like characters, funny dialogues (really, there are dialogues??), and a kind of irony that will make you chuckle a lot.However, after a while, you can sure overplay it. So, since it takes only little space on the disk - I leave it there, and grab it from time to time and now it has been a loooong time I've played it. It fits very well into the gaps of not knowing what to play because you played it all and are so fed up with it that you think you might focus on your real life again, because maybe, just maybe you're missing out on job, wife, kids, sport and food. F@ck that!But - most and foremost: this is absolutely mindless fun, democracy, freedom, 'Murica... all taken with such self irony, that you scream every 2 seconds: open up, mofo, FREEDOM IS HERE!

While the game is exactly all of those things, it also has many other redeeming points.The gameplay is overwhelmingly simple. There is nothing wrong with an easy game to play. I for one enjoy games where you can pick it up and play no matter what mood you are in. The fast paced action makes for a brilliant casual game to play when you have a few minutes to kill.Storywise, there is none. From what I gather anyway. It's just a matter of shooting through hoards and hoards of bad guys and saving your chums who have been kept prisoner. The reward system is based on how many prisoners you actually rescure, and the rewards you get equate into new playable characters, or ""Bros"". You start off with being able to play Rambo and you work your way through to the likes of Conan the Barbarian, or Broman the Brobarian....Completing the main game is very short, I managed to do it in roughly two hours of picking up and playing every now and again. There are still plenty of other game modes such as Arcade, coop, (online and local) as well as a level editor which will add hours of endless mindnumbing badguy killing frenzies.I would highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a shooting or action game. You cannot go wrong, and the devs are bound to add more features and levels in the future."

Game which has never appealed to me (also in the catergory most games where you play as a sentient slab of meat.) so I never thought to give it a chance, but the amount of games with Local CO-OP on the PC is extremely low, and I found myself, sitting with some friends and becoming more and more attracted to Broforce... I'd stare wistfully at it's title page and wonder ""am I maybe being too harsh?""The answer dear reader is that yes I was being way too harsh, Broforce is a game that does not take itself seriously in the slightest, it takes on destruction, action movie violence, and fun with the same enthusiasm that usually is reserved for drunken sex... you throw yourself in there, never quite sure which parts are where, but it's working and it feels great!Also like drunken sex... it's a lot more fun when someone else is involved.When you first start you will die... with some regularity, but it's never unfair and in taking it's cue from Hotline Miami, and other games of this type, a checkpoint is no more than a button press away, indeed even when you run out of lives the mission failed screen is up for like a second, after that you are right back in the action.You will laugh at the movie refrences for the different bros, find yourself remembering the classic films and where they are from, and with each one having unique weapons and special abilites the desire to unlock the next one never gets grindy...The destruction is incredible, and I often find myself coming back, just to blow up some dirt. There is very very little to find fault with here, a few bugs here and there, but for an early access title it's incredibly polished, there is a beauty to it despite the pixel graphics, the explosions feel right, the weapons pack a punch! and the variety of enemies will keep you looking for weakspots and fast paced tactics to best smash through them...And then you die because you weren't looking where you were going, and a rock fell on your head.But it doesn't matter because unlike the aforementioned drunken sex, you will never for a minute regret the decision to purchase this game.

Each character have their own unique weapon and special, though some character is cleary better than some character. TimeBro, the hero that can slow down time can wipe out the whole multiplayer game if use correctly. Character like Conan the Brobarian is rather a cameo than a useful heroes. Whenever you die, you will get a random heroes that you had rescure from POW, but randomizing the character sometimes feels like your game is up to luck rather than skill.Broforce side scrolling is fun and memorable, because the game map can be compeleted in many ways. For example you can choose to gun down all enemies, or you can dig under them and get behind them, or you can just rush to the end of the level. The game rarely have glitches, even if it does have glitches it didn't affect the gameplay. Terrain are destroyable by shooting it and barrels explode when they are shot. The game will sometime have some difficulty spikes at the end of the level by decreasing the number of POW you can rescue, which can make the games less fun and more stressing.Enemy AI is rather stupid, and it makes the game enjoyable because it makes you feel like a badass after killing tons of them.

,Recommended,274190,16252636,"Posted: 7 June, 2015",all,Rehmedyy,"In Broforce's arcade-style campaign, or its suite of alternate modes, you take on the role of a randomized bro and kill your way across jungles and cities, aiming for an exit point or a boss fight. The way you get there is at your discretion, though. The terrain gets blasted away by your weaponry the same as any enemy; in keeping with the Minecraft/Spelunky zeitgeist, tunneling through 20 feet of concrete with a shotgun is as valid a way to the level's end as any other. Such freedom opens up some interesting strategic possibilities, like shooting the floor out from underneath an otherwise imposing foe. It also makes for some zany, unpredictable runs, especially when you're paired with trigger-happy teammates who don't give much thought to blowing up the platform you're standing on. The campaign can be taken online, and there are a few local multiplayer diversions on offer, like a player-versus-player deathmatch, and another variant that sees characters fleeing an encroaching blast from the left side of the screen."

There are also some areas that are so difficult they will make you want to tear your hair out.Some of the Bros in the game also feel pretty useless and you will come to rely on a few specific bros to help you beat the levels more easily (If you are lucky to spawn as them).Overall though Broforce is one of the best Indie games in years and will definitely give you enough value and laughs for the price."

This game is basically the 80’s with more testosterone.Length:3 hoursScore:8/10Review Date2015-04-02 (Early Access)Full Review:Broforce is a game very much influenced by 80’s action movies. As a fan of this kind of movie (though I’ve not seen all the ones this game takes influence from), it’s a pretty fun thing to play.The gameplay is pretty simple; it’s a 2D shooter that takes a lot of influence from Contra. That said, it’s also a lot easier of a game. You move left to right, shooting your enemies, and destroying the environment. In fact, that’s part of the fun. Everything goes boom, and you can destroy most of the environment. If one path through a level isn’t working out so hot for you, you can blow up some of the terrain and see if you can go around.The character you play as dies in one hit, so you do need to show some caution while playing, but thankfully not too much, allowing you to still run into danger with a headstrong reckless abandon. You start each level with one life, but you can collect more in the level, you’ll receive one extra life every time you rescue a bro.And that’s one of the things we need to focus on for this review. The bros. Each bro is based on various characters from different movies, tv shows, and even comics; and each one plays differently. Most of the bros are based on 80’s action movie heroes, but we’re also treated to characters from earlier and later time periods. The core mechanics for the bros give you a main attack, which you can use as much as you want, and a special attack, which you have only a limited number of (1-6, depending on the bro).The levels have cages scattered throughout them, containing captured bros. Each time you rescue a bro the game will automatically switch your character to a random bro, and give you another life. You unlock new brows to play as by increasing the total number of bros you’re rescued. When you die in a level, you’ll re-spawn from the last checkpoint as another random bro.All this talk of bros begs the question, who are the bros featured in this game? Well, I won’t list all of them since part of the fun is being surprised, but I will talk about a few of them. When you first start the game, you play as Rambro (yes, all the bros have “bro” in their name, usually as a pun on either their name, or their franchise’s name). This is of course a pretty solid choice to begin the game with. Both as he’s an iconic action hero, and in game he’s armed with a machine gun and grenades, making it easy to dive right into the action and get to shooting.As for the other bros, I was quite happy to see that Bro Hard (John McClane) included, and they even left him barefoot, which is a pretty nice touch. I was also pretty happy (and surprised) to see Bro Dredd (Judge Dredd) included, who’s gun fires bullets that both have (limited) homing abilities, and bounce off walls, (another nice touch, managing to incorporate two of his bullet types from the comics, heat-seeking and ricochet). Another fun one I was happy to see (though much less surprised) was Robrocop. The Terminator also makes an appearance, with a powerful gatling gun, and he’s a lot of fun to play as. Some of the other bros (with their non-broified names) included are Snake Plissken (Escape From New York), Blade (Marvel Comics), Men In Black, Neo (The Matrix), Indiana Jones, and quite a few others.So, let’s talk about some of the weapons the different bros have. Machine guns are par for the course, with quite a few bros packing rapid fire heat. Others have more unique firearms, with shotguns, homing shots, spread guns, and more populating the game’s arsenal. Others opt for more literal firearms, and by that I mean a flamethrower. While others take less modern weapons, such as swords, knives, and whips; still others go for the future route, with high tech lasers and futuristic guns. And some simply prefer to do their dirty work with just their fists. As for some of the special weapons available for use, the bros are equipped with things like grenades, cluster bombs, Molotov cocktails, more powerful gun attacks, the ability to call down an air strike, and even a giant exploding turkey. The weapon variety is a lot of fun, and along with the selection of bros, is one of the game’s greatest strengths. Though sadly, some of the bros are less effective than others. Sometimes the difference is small, and sometimes it’s quite large.The game’s graphics are done in a simple pixel art style, in the vein of old school shooters, though it looks a bit more polished than those of yore. They’re pleasant to look at, and I don’t have any real complaints about them.The story and the setting for the game are pretty simple, you’re sent into a war zone, and must fight for freedom. It feels a bit too “America, ♥♥♥♥ yeah” for me at times, but it’s easy to overlook once you start shooting and making things go boom again. The final levels in the game pit you against alien invaders from another world, clearly inspired by the Alien franchise. (And they are the best levels in the game).The game also features support for multiplayer fun, and while I only took a brief excursion into this myself, it was pretty good fun.I should also note that while you can play the game with a keyboard, this is one of those games that is far better when played with a controller. As such, I’d highly recommend using an X-Box 360 controller for Windows when playing Broforce.Now, the game itself is very short. The campaign mode will only take about a mere 3 hours to play through, and while it’s a lot of fun, it does leave one wanting for more. Thankfully, the game is still early access, so we should get more levels in the future. Even if we don’t, the game is still a blast, and certainly worth playing, but at its current length it’s probably better to pick it up on sale, instead of paying the full $15 for it. That said, the new levels that were added just before I purchased the game (the Alien Infestation update) were thrilling, and while there weren’t too many of those included, they were easily some of the best in the game. If this is the kind of content that future updates will be, then I very eagerly look forward to more.If you’re still not quite sure on if you should pick up Broforce or not, you could grab The Exependabros on Steam for free. It’s a game that features characters from The Expendables 3, but set in Broforce style levels. It’s not as good as the actual Broforce game, but it works pretty well as a demo if you need a little convincing before plunking down your cash for this one. (Or if you simply need more Broforce action after completing this game, go grab it for a quick hour long romp).When all’s said and done, Broforce is a hell of a lot of fun, and being able to fight your way across levels as an assortment of different characters with different weapons is quite enjoyable. Give it a chance, start blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up with your favourite action heroes."

It's a game where you 'liberate' Vietnam from evil by taking control of a host of characters from classic and contemporary action films. Think Rambo, Commando, Terminator, Time Cop and Alien. Each character brings their own weapons and abilities to the fray. While they don't differ much (each as a primary weapons, a secondary weapon and a knife). The difference comes in the patterns and speed. Rambo has a machine gun and grenades, while Terminator brings his minigun and ability to sustain unlimited damage. Even more off the wall are chracters like Neo and Conan who rely on brutal melee attacks.The gameplay itself is extremely fast paced. The ground around can be destroyed at will and will be destroyed, often forcing you to rethink you approach as your airstrike just blew up your foothold. This is the chaos where Broforce is at its best. The moments where you're scrambling up crumbling mountains, slaying hundreds of mooks on your way. When you finally reach the top, you'll slap five and call awesome.But, it gets better. You can bring up to three friends and the chaos just became a million times worse. Suddenly you have to be carefull not kill your own bud, while at the same time murdering the evil insurgents. Yes, or you can actively seek to murder your friends.Free Lives is still working on the game and they're releasing updates quite frequently; adding new characters and stages for you to unlock. While it might not last very long, it is a treat to come back to each time with friends if you have 30 minutes to kill.

Broforce has finally been pushed out from Early Access to Official Release, and I'm here to say that it's worth it! I have played it from early on in the Early Access stage (I think sometime before the ""Death from Above"" update) and it is a simple, yet totally addicting game full of chaos, machismo and camaraderie (there's co-op!!!!).Broforce is basically the REAL video game version of the Expendables, as in several action heroes are in this puppy! Rambo, Barabus, Terminator, Neo, John McClane, Cherry from Planet Terror and MANY more are unlockable characters! It's a pixel side scrolling gauntlet of blood, gore, explosions and ♥♥♥♥ yeah attitude along the lines of Soldat (especially with the pixel gore), but with more plot, cutscenes, music and more! The only point of the game? Kill the enemy! With firearms, detonating hazardous obstacles, tearing shoddy enemy encampments inside out, and more!!! So long as you defeat the boss, throw Satan off a cliff and grab the helicopter escape, you've got this!Broforce has a run and gun method of gameplay similar to Metal Slug, but sped up way more, with MANY more options of accomplishing the same mission. You spawn, you kill lots of terrorists, rescue more Bros to play as, kill Satan, and DONE! Onto the next level!!! As you advance in Campaign or Arcade mode, you unlock more ""Bros"" and get a chance to utilize their various attacks and special abilities. From there, you keep the mission rolling! You have the option of single player or online co op, a level editor for making your own campaigns, a versus setting for controller plug-in death matches, difficulty settings, and now, thanks to the Official Release, Ironbro Mode! (it's really really hard).Downsides of this game?NONE. Maybe I'm still in the honeymoon phase with it, but good god, tell me you wouldn't love a game where Neo from Matrix punches a beehive into an enemy encampment, followed by MacGyver putting a bomb on a terrorist before he runs into the explosive barrel room, followed by the guy from Commando obliterating a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥shaped helicopter? I suppose if you're one of those people who didn't like Team America or Starship Troopers for being ""too Republican"" this game isn't going to snatch you up. But seriously? Give it a try.

They were over the top, stupid, and loud as hell- Everything America stands for. And they were great.BROFORCE toes the same line as many of those old action flicks.  It's a celebration of testosterone, bullets, and bombs, taken to the nth degree +1. If Stephen Colbert and Torgue Flexington developed a game, it would come out a lot like this.And it's magnificent.The controls are better than you'd think with a keyboard. They're tight. Responsive. It takes getting used to, and a controller would be better, but it's not bad.The gameplay is simple and open-ended in a great way. You could go all out and dive straight in like a madman. You could take your time and pick out the best possible attack route... Or you could defeat your enemies by exploiting the environment, which is the most patriotic way.All that aside, BROFORCE is one of the few games I've played in a while that's just plain fun. No intricate plot. No dark, brooding hero. No 'LOOK AT HOW GRIMDARK AND BROWN THE WORLD IS, BLOO BLOO BLOO'.

I really love the randomness of the game, and how every level plays out differently everytime because of the round robin selection of dozens upon dozens of bro's and broette's. Easy to pick up, hard to master. Immpossible to put down.The multiplayer really shines with a super slick drop in/out feature. Other players can't really interupt your game and troll you that easily either, what with the sheer amount of chaos on screen almost all the time.

,Recommended,274190,11832611,"Posted: 23 August, 2014",all,bobert awful (F+),"Broforce is a game where you have to learn to improvise. Sure, you start out with the one Bro who has guns, but soon, you're unlocking melee-only bros, bros that only have flamethrowers and bombs, bros with certain perks that dramatically affect the way you play the game. You don't get to choose your Bro, the Bro chooses you, and like any good action hero, you gottakillliberate them all with the cards you've been dealt. That's Bro life.I would like Broforce more if the difficulty curve didn't spike like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, however. Most levels are pretty much you getting the hang of Bros and creating cool explosions that fill the screen and liberate everyone in view! However this kind of thing doesn't really mesh all that well with the bosses, which are more of your Contra-sidescroller fare. One moment, you're improvising with explosives and bullets on very squishy goons, the next you've gotta figure out how the hell you're going todestroyliberate this giant tank with eight sections orpushforce-feed hot dogs to a Bro in a mech suit off the cliff. It's two different kinds of gameplay styles that don't mesh all that well together.But god dammit, when it works, it works.

You have come to the right place, brother or sister, Broforce deliveres this all in truck or helicopter loads, fueling your power fantasies, one shell at a time.But to be more serious, Broforce is a really fun game, lots of eye candy all over the place.Thanks to next-gen particle effects and the pure amount of explosions being able to be rendered all over your screen, it can get rather confusing at times but i'm not saying thats even a bad thing.In short: very nice to look at.The movement system allows for a bunch of ways to swing you butt over all that non-american soil and if all your gracious parkour moves fail, you can still blast your way through that pesky terrorist wall, keeping you from turning the bad guys on the other side to a red pulp on the temporary floor.Thanks to hords of enemys and lots of bros to play as, variaty is guaranteed forat leastthe first hours of playing, up until you've unlocked and figured out the best way to play as every bro and can speedrun your way through all story missions.But thats the part where the level editor comes in.Are you creative? Like to build 2D levels? Like to add tiny details that oh so often slip by most players in their unsadisfiable thirst for blood? Good, because Broforce got you covered, althought in it's current state the level editor isn't all that userfriendly, so i hope you like exploration too.But lets say you don't feel very creative or are just plain lazy.Not a problem, you can play levels, other Bros put together and uploaded for public enjoyment and there are levels being added every couple of days, just don't expect there to already be a new level uploaded as soon as you reload the level browser (yet).What gets on my nerves, and thats not even the developers fault, is that there are so many co-op exclusive modes that i can't play because non of my friends can handle the freedom being dealt out in here.This means, people like me will feel like missing out on maybe 25-30% of extra game content.But hey, there is a way around that if you aren't entirly like me and don't mind playing with strangers around the globe, because there is actually the option to play online!The worst thing i could honestly say about this game is that, even thought it has a level editor and an active community building new levelsand,the possibility to play online with friends or strangers, it can get stale after some time of playing, so taking a break for a few days or even weeks after you got bored is advisable, wouldn't want you dragging your gun along the ground, out of pure unmotivation, while boredly stabbing Terrorist #1369 again.So all in all, if you've got some money to blow on games, why not give this very entertaining and gory, if a bit mindless at times, Freedom Simulator a chance?"

This game is a straight-up silly pastiche of 80s/90s era action movie men thrust into a comedic crossover in which everyone’s name is changed to fit the word “Bro”.As you would expect, everything is way over the top with hilarious levels of patriotism and violence in every level. Your goal is simple: get to the end of the level and kill satan and/or the boss of that stage. Along the way you can rescue captured bros, whom replace your current bro on release. You have a good variety of bros at your disposal and additional bros will become available once you meet certain rescue quotas. This game also features a decent co-op system and can be loads of fun in either local or online multiplayer.This game does have a few performance issues has been known to sometimes run poorly even on excellent rigs. Adjusting post-processing may alleviate this a little bit but for most of the time you will just have to grin and bear it when the fps drops happen. It also crashed every time I quit the game but I never had any issues with corrupt save data so no big deal there either.I managed to squeeze 8 hours out of Broforce playing it off and on from when I first picked it up in early access back in 2014. Since then, the game has made leaps and bounds in adding content, characters, and bug fixes and has become somewhat of a success story proving that early access doesn’t always mean “bad game” (granted it did take about 2 years). The game seems to have arrived at its final state so, if you’re wondering about picking it up, any time is a good time to have a bro time."

Each character is different, with different weapons and abilities.The leves are full of exploding barrels, mines, enimies and lives(which make you swap to a new character).Everthing seems to happen at once and can be a lot to take in at some points. But the more you play the better you get and the eaisier it becomes (except the helicopter chase level, screw that).For an early access game it's amazing, and I cant wait to see what they add.A must buy for Metal Slug and Mega Man fans."

The game play is quite alot of fun, especially with 3 friends. Seeing all the 80's-90's-early 2000's action hero's is also fun, if your old enough to remember which movies they're all from. (Spoiler : Antonio Banderas from the Mexico trilogy DOES NOT make an appearance, much to my disappointment) But aside from the awesome characters, heavy stereotypical 'merican action movie atmosphere and somewhat challenging level design..........sometimes, there really isn't much else to the game. AAaAAaaaaaannd, cue the lights....Darkness floods the stage. Everyone is quiet. A single light turns on above a dark skinned man seated upon a high stool, dressed in clothing expected from someone about to read fine poetry. ""What if I told you........"" the man begins in a deep stern voice ""......that Broforce....... isn't as awesome as the world wants you to believe......."" The audience gasps, sucking the air from the room! Nay Sayers rowel up and expected phrases can be heard being strewn about over the anarchy.""My children look up to these characters, who else will teach mah son to protect our country?""  ""You can't feed us this garbage! This is 'merica!"" ""Go back to where you came from and stay there until we finish this wall!"" And so, the man stands up to leave the stage. But before he does, he turns to the mic and leaves these few words..........Its a run, jump and shoot game, just like any other. Sure it has pretty backgrounds and a vast array of characters that we can recognize easily, but there's nothing groundbreaking here. And abit over priced at $17 (CDN). Maybe $10 when not on sale, maybe.Otherwise, have fun! Rockets!!!! (_(_)=====D~~~~'''',,,,,,"

The enviroments are beautifully destructive and the action is fast and furious; you'll never even be a particular character for any reasonable length of time, as rescuing hostages will always switch you with another Bro. And you'll welcome it too, as the very diverse cast of our favorite action movies are in the cast, ranging from Rambo to RoboCop to John McClaine to freaking Agent J.The control scheme is simplistic, but exactly what's needed for this type of game. Basically, you have your movement, your main gun, a melee attack, and a secondary special weapon with limited uses, each of  those differing for every Bro. As you unlock more, the roulette of ""Which favorite is next?"" will keep every level a unique blast from the last.Seriously, this game is just at Beta, basically? Late summer can't come faster for this game, but until then there's always time to hang with the Bros."

The only people who don't like this game are the terrorists and my girlfriend. Sure, she gives me love and support, but you know what she doesn't give me? EXPLOSIONS! Broforce: 1, Significant other: 0! It's kinda like The Expendables: The Game, only better than the actual The Expendables: The Game. The mayham makes this game consistantly entertaining, and the randomized characters makes the mayham constant. Not being able to choose the bro you play as does sound a bit strange, but it fits into the gameplay very well. So if you like freedom and want a game more American than apple pie and baseball, this is for you. If you say the trailers and/or gameplay footage and were interested, you will most likely enjoy it. All we need now is a Liam Neeson bro, a Jason Statham bro (Probably from Crank), and a bro of Turbo-Man from Jingle All The Way. Call him Turbro-Man. You can thank me later."

The only major issue I have with this Early Access gem is that it's short on levels - a problem slowly being resolved by the community and to be improved on by the developers as time goes on.At its core, Broforce is an intense, old-school platformer. The player can take one bullet, explosion, or what-have-you, but has a slowly increasing pool of lives. Skilled timing and awareness are key to surviving and excelling in the fast-and-furious shootouts between mook and bro.Variety, as well, plays a key role in every encounter. The player's character is randomly selected from a long list of action movie heroes with unique talents and behavior and every level presents a wealth of different ways to be completed. Did the game give you Rambo? Lob a grenade to terrify your opponents and gun them down in the confusion. Did Indiana Jones step up to the plate? Whip the guns out of your enemy's hands and wipe clear the leftovers with your devastating revolver. Every bro offers a unique experience and every situation highlights just how differently every bro handles it.On top of the rich amount of options, from destroying terrain to bypassing enemies altogether, Broforce is a game that never ceases to surprise. A chain reaction of barrels, suicide bombers, or even just collapsing scenery can lead to unexpected victory, defeat, or simply hilarity. Over-the-top action movie heroes, dim-witted mooks, and more explosions than you can shake a stick of dynamite at make for comedy gold in the most unexpected of situations.Broforce and its dedication to the things that make me proud to be a God-fearing, red-blooded, American patriot have helped restore my faith in Early Access games. I wish Extra Lives all the best with this title and greatly look forward to the bright, flaming, shrapnel-battered future ahead."

The latter has limited uses, but can be refilled by pickups. Since the some characters have vastly different attacks, it thoroughly affects the gameplay, and what strategies are viable. There are also unlockable gadgets you can find in crates, such as small exploding RC cars etc.The maps are for the most part destructable AND full of explosives, so this MUST be Mr. Torgue's favourite game. Every map ends with a boss fight, and they are for the most part well done and entertaining, but again, depending on what character you have, it can be a walk in the park or very frustrating.I used a Xbox360 controller, and generally had a blast, but every now and then the randomness of it all aggravated me a bit.  The campaign took me around 6-7 hours.And if the action is too dull, you can always team up with 3 other American heroes, as the game supports 4 player local or internet co-op. I had a few games online, but it was simply too much uncoordinated chaos for me.82%"

It's not a game you will probably spend untold hours into the thick of the night playing to get every last discovery, but a game you can come back to repeatedly, frequently, for an awesome taste of brotastic action, especially with a bro. The controls are responsive with plenty of versatility in movement and decent attacking options (character-specific basic and special power).A lot more can be said about this game but should be experienced first-hand. For instance, if I said that one's ability to appreciate a seemingly endless chain of action movie hero references would increase one's enjoyment even more, would that tip the scales? Probably not by itself, but coupled with a solid game and humorous pixel artwork, it certainly adds to the feel of bro'ing out with some power bros and kicking badguy a$$.With gameplay inspired by classics such as Commando, Contra and Metal Slug, mixed with modern physics effects, and a great variety of extra game modes, multiplayer and other content, Broforce actually delivers."

,Recommended,274190,29693944,Posted: 4 February,all,Professor Plumbus,"Broforce is a video game that humorously parodies American action cinema. The game has a large variety of protagonists that are all inspired by characters of classic action movies and television shows. Impressively, the available characters span more than thirty years of cinema.The problems with the game are few, but sometimes significant. The gratuitous (but awesome) gore of Broforce can sometimes (albeit rarely) cause visibility issues. Also, the many explosions will ultimately hinder your ability to progress in a level. This problem is most prevalent in the final level in particular. In comparison to the rest of the game, the last level falls short. It's too lengthy and interrupts the fast pace of the gameplay. It feels like minimum effort, complimentary DLC— which it may have possibly been.If you're interested in Broforce or you're jonesing for more action then be sure to grab The Expendabros on Steam!

Only the slimmest and most utterly masculine game I've ever played in years, naturally! It's super small, super short, extremely to the point, and it's awesome.It's called Broforce.Developed by the indie developer Free Lives, Broforce is a deliberate mash-up of all the clichés that were so central to those twenty years of American big-budget filmmaking. There's no story, no setup – you simply are a bro, you have to free other bros and “liberate” an endless succession of tropical vistas in dire need of seeing a pixellated 'Murrican flag fly high in a couple places. The bros that aren't your bros are the bad bros – and you have to kill these. Violently. With lots of bullets and explosives.See, playing as an American in the super-serious Band of Brothers series is one thing. Playing as an American in Call of Duty is another. In Broforce, though? I absolutely have to butcher the word, because there's too much ♥♥♥♥ing testosterone onscreen for me to consider writing it as anything other than 'Murrica. ♥♥♥♥, yeah! Gonna liberate all them freedoms and democraticize – dermocr – I'MMA FIRE MY DEMOCRACY RAY ALL OVER DEM JUNGLE COMMIES, HURRKDRKGLRK.(insert highly-virile, if pre-verbal grunts, along with the sounds of my simian self attempting to copulate with the nearest available orifice, nevermind how impractical or dangerous this may be)Ahem.In pure Arcade fashion, the game times you and measures how many vaguely threatening balaclava-wearing enemies you've blown to kingdom come. Combining both of these factors satisfactorily nets you a fairly high score, and that's what you're shooting for. At its purely minimal, though, the game is really about reaching the end-of-level flag, which actually is a hovering helicopter. Grab that, and your last controlled bro takes off, even as all the explosives you haven't detonated in the level go off simultaneously and a killer electric guitar solo plays you out. It's pixellized, there's blood everywhere, the soundtrack feels suitably Eighties Commando Warfare-ish, but the real draw is in how your extra lives are handled.Across each level, you'll find tied and gagged prisoners that may or may not be stuck behind bars. Shoot or blow them free, and they'll all reveal themselves to be one of the Bros – basically a uber-simplified parody of your typical Action Flick Leading Man. Blade becomes Brade, John McLane becomes Bro Hard, Chuck Norris' Cordell Walker becomes Brodell Walker, McGuyver is rechristened as MacBrover – you get the idea. There's dozens of little pixelly packs of sheer man-juices for you to unlock, and not all of them control identically. MacBrover has no guns but can pull dynamite sticks out of nowhere. Brambo has his trusty machine gun, and John Matrix' Commando analogue, Brommando, packs his assault rifle and grenades. There's also B.A. Broacus, Bro Dredd, Bro in Black, Snake Broskin, the Brominator, Brobocop and my all-time favorite, Indiana Brones.Hells yeah."

I get that it's being funded for development, but I still found it to be a lot of money for what you get.2. The campaign is too short. I played with my friend for about 2 hours before they had to stop, and later that week I pressed 'continue campaign', and the campaign was apparently already completed when I played it with my friend, and the final level was just an animated cutscene."

,Recommended,274190,18968270,"Posted: 9 November, 2015",all,Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic),"Broforce is not simply another mindless videogame. It handles war more clever than even the Metal Gear games to critique the American military industrial complex in the conflicts of the bleaker moments of US history as well as the politics of today.Bro, You Serious?Upon first-glances, the game appears as a nonsense-filled American adventure of blinding heroism. Underlying the action-hero storyline and gameplay, there is a self-awareness of the pro-war sentimentality of the U.S and Allied nations from the '60s through '90s.Through the action-hero icons of your playable cast, the game uses its macho heroes' aesthetic to convey its patriotism. This is a deliberate choice to make the player think what he is doing is ALWAYS right. And the game's narrative reinforces that idea by ignoring the enemies' thoughts and the game always blaiming them for being potential terrorists because they are different.For example,  the POWs, a horrible memory of history ,is rendered into an action-hero mechanic. They are not beaten, mentally-unstable individuals who at any moment might die in their capter's hands. Instead, they are all potential action-heros to take the spotlight should a ""bro"" fall in combat.The geography of the map also emphasizes the severity behind the ""in-game"" mechanics/enemies like the POWs (taken from Metal Slug and set in not-Vietnam), the nameless, demonized terrorists in the East (Russians, Muslims and the IRA) and aliens (encrouching upon the homeland). Finally coming to a self-awareness that even America, land of freedom, is ultimately plagued by satantists and demons, and they must be purged (atheists and non-Christians).The message through gameplay is that all conflicts can be resolved with blind heroics just like the Hollywood blockbusters have instilled into the minds of the masses. But what is always there while you play are the real-world conflicts masked by the fantasy of an action-hero movie.In the end, you perservere any obstacle in your way clinging to a false notion of freedom. At what cost is that freedom worth to corpses? At one point do you consider the ramifications of your heroics? How can you justify your actions?These are the difficult questions the game leaves you with...Or not...? Maybe it's a Bromantical Comedy.Okay, real-talk. I completely made up that entire interepretation of this game. And yet, after finishing through two runs of the game (12 hours), I cannot but wonder if the game played me like a fool when I first paroided something that always seemed to be aware of the joke too.The main point I'm trying to say is... Don't take this game too seriously. Have fun!Cue the '80s MontageThis game is what it sells itself; cheesy, nonsense American action with all your favorite action heroes. Each character controls similarly (one attack, one special and one melee--or another special--attack) as a basic jump-and-shoot game.The interesting aspect is each character's unique abilities and quirks. In total, there is a cast of 29/30 to play with, and as you start off with Rambro, the simpliest character, you can get some ludicrous characters that require skill like Cherry Bromb, Indiana Brones and Bronan the Barbarian.The game keeps a ""rogue-lite"" feel without making an entirely random experience. This is a statement both to the game's benefit and to its detriment.Levels are always the same, but how you go through them is based on who you are playing. Every level does not require you to have one specific character, and every level has fully-destructable terrain to make each playthrough (or retry) different from the last. You can carve your own paths, literally, and this mechanic never entirely ruins or breaks the game.No character is mandatory, but there are some levels better suited towards the level/boss. This wouldn't be a problem if you could select your bro-loadout (maybe as a post-game reward) or know what you will have at any point in the game.Every time you begin a level you start with a random bro, and whenever you save a Bro on the battlefield you will get another randomized Bro (and an extra life, which is very useful as every Bro takes one hit).This ""rouge-lite"" experience doesn't get in your way because the levels are short (2 to 3 mins if you're careful, excluding boss-fights), and if you fail you can retry the same stage without playing it the same way. It's a good solution to make playing the game over again better as well as failing those harder stages multiple times.But, as I mentioned before, not everything is flawless because of the random nature of the game.""Oh, Brother""That is my reaction whenever I get the worst character possible for a level, and this is not because one character requires more skill. It's because of balancing issues. Namely the enemy variety towards the end-game.When fighting from terrorists to aliens to demons, most characters retain a balancing act hampered only by enemy behaviors not compatible with a specific hero. Bosses are the worst at this, which can either be riddiculous challenges with some characters or a breeze with certain characters (Cherry Bomb with the Alien Heart is so simple).It also doesn't help that some abilities are rendered useless because of the level (Chuck Norris' airstrikes underground) or by the enemies your fighting (Neo's bullettime with Xenomorphs). Thankfully, some characters are compensated for when their abilities are useless (Norris' shotgun is my favorite).The level-design is never against you, which is good, but I think if they fleshed out some characters' abilities to work on specific enemies or all of them, then the game would be a lot more polished without these unfair difficulty spikes.You Can Go Alone or WIth BrosAlso, one important point: This game is not a game where you need to grab some friends. (Although it makes the game a lot more interesting/chaotic). The game balances its overall difficulty nicely by giving solo players more extra bros to spare, while making extra players more helpful in dealing with bosses and hordes of enemies.And despite the problems with the game, none of these ruin the game from being enjoyed for what it is and the replay value is high with muliple modes, the rouge-lite elements and the Steam Workshop levels (only the devs can provide more heroes to keep every character interesting and balanced).Is it worth $15? I would think so, even when playing by yourself for a 4 to 5 hour adventure. There is Ironbro Mode for a Contra-like feel, the Workshop campaigns, and the game itself is a joy. And cooperative play will offer tons of other replay value from the amount of chaos you can unlesh with a group of four.Just don't take this game seriously. It's not.Maybe.Possibly.No.You take a leak on Satan's grave."

This is pretty accurate but I would also throw in Super Meat Boy, not only for the art style but the crazy jumping and movement throughout the level.Imagine the above type of game then throw in '80s and '90s action movie icons such as  Rambo, Schwarzenegger's Commando, Walker Texas Ranger, The Terminator, Judge Dredd, Robocop, MR T and MacGuyver. Each with two different attacks, one regular and one special attack. MacGuyver's turkey with dynamite stuffing was hilarous.So 10 out of 10 for me and in keeping with other reviews:'MURRICA, F**k YEAH""I prefer... the weapon you only have to fire once.

It has become my default party game, running 4 bros with controllers to my living room TV.  The game is HECTIC, with a lot going on on-screen at once.  The key is to be patient, and not rush into battle.  The game becomes even better with it's guitar solos and over the top patriotisn.  It plays a lot like a pixelated metal slug.  The game never gets old.One thing that makes this game stand out from the rest is that the developers are ALWAYS adding more content.

Normally I don't go for Early Access games but I was charmed by the trailers and the tongue-in-cheek nature of this game.If you like to blow stuff up and silly humour then this game is definitely for you. I personally can't wait for the Campaign to be completed as I have had a lot of fun with the Campaign as it currently stands.As far as 'Bang-for-Buck', this game is the best Game I have purchased on Steam since Prison Architect. They even include a level editor in this game to keep you coming back for more. I can't wait for the community to get bigger and for people to make their own custom campaigns.There are some minor problems with this game, but since I have started playing the developers have already got rid of most of these bugs so I would imagine that by full-release everything will be ironed out.Definitely get it if it's on Sale.

If you love old action movies and stars, Broforce is your game. If you love old side scrolling games with lots of guns and explosions, Broforce is your game.  If you don't mind a challenge and like a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, Broforce is your game.Basically, Broforce is an homage to old action movies and action stars.  Going back to the '60s (James Bond) and all the way to the early 2000s, (Kill Bill, Planet Terror.)  Mostly, it's got a lot of “old” gold action stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Silvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, Mr. T, Chuck Norris, etc. in parodies of their various roles.  The plot is a lot like a lot of those old action films:  bad guys are doing bad things and have taken good guys hostage and are threatening the world.  Your bros are sent in to kill the bad guys, save the good guys, save the world.  Basic action film stuff.The graphics are done in wonderful '80s style pixel art.  The level design is pretty clever and varies.  Also, the game has random elements.  Placement of enemy types, explosive barrels, ammo drops and other things can vary from one play through to another in a single level.  Those aren't the only random things.  Which bros you are using are also chosen randomly, cycling through the ones you've unlocked as you die or as you save your allies.  These random elements add a huge replay value to the game as you may have different enemies and bros to contend with in the same level.The play is very cool, side scrolling with lots of action, shooting and explosions.  The game is ultra violent.  Enemies (and bros) can be shot, stabbed, cut in half, shredded, exploded, decapitated, and crushed.  Blood, (pixels, of course) body parts, bones, etc. can scatter everywhere.  Though, the game isn't always fair.  In fact, it can be quite unfair at times.  The difficulty doesn't ramp up very quickly, but it does ramp up as you play.  When you get into the double digit Campaign levels, those boss fights can be quite tough.  Also, the game can sometimes give you “cheap” deaths.  But, it's all in good fun.  If you take it too seriously, you probably won't enjoy the game.  My hat's off to anybody who can get the “There Can Bro Only One” achievement.  ;)So, that's about all I can say about this wonderful gem of a game.  I find it extremely enjoyable, if unfair and downright frustrating at times.  But, I like a challenge."

It's one of those games that's so good when you're about half way through you start to wonder how much is left because you don't want it to end.    A little drepression sets in as you count how many remaining levels and have a ""mid-game crisis"".  You start to slow down a bit to relish in it's awesomeness just a bit longer.  And that depression is instantly replaced euphoria and the facial pain from grinning for hours as you pop in to the next few levels. Yup, it's awesome.if you've already bought it: why are you reading reviews for a game you own?  Seriously?If you're about to buy it now: good, buy it now.If you're on the fence: buy it now.If you're not really interested: get interested, buy it now.Oh, and in response to all those people that say all those terrible things about the game like ""buy it now"", or ""you should buy it now"", or ""definely buy it"".

Broforce is the second early access I've bought in to and although my first will remain nameless, Broforce has been an amazing surprise! The development team has been clearly focused on core gameplay and it shows. After I finished the single player campaign solo at 1am last night, I decided to give multiplayer a try. I'm not a big PC online player. Getting mics working properly and listening to whiners isn't worth the effort, but I loved the quick death/respawn/lives aspect to the gameplay. You can just jump in and keep pounding away. Each unlockable character was surprising, hilarious, unique and entirely playable.Feature requests:More levels! The beta isn't too short per-say, but I would have kept playing for another 3 acts straight if they were there.I noticed there was a map editor, hopefully you can do something like Spelunky's weekly map but build it up over time into a player made and/or dev made serial level set we can play like the single campaign.Character description when you pause please. I still don't know what Neo does with his special move. I like discovering what different about each one, but if it's a complete mystery I may never find out what great gameplay stuff I can do with them! Even a ""moves"" list would be cool.Everyone should get in on this. Goog luck!"

You play as one of many ""Bros"" (spoofed movie characters like Mr. Anderbro from The Matrix, Bro Hard, BroboCop, etc.) and each time you save a Bro in a level, you get an extra life, but the interesting thing about that is that you also BECOME the Bro you just saved, so you're constantly changing characters, each with their own special abilities and fighting styles. On top of that, the action is fast and often challenging (but never unfair) and there are even some simple environmental puzzels that will take you a moment to figure out (how do I get across that impossibly wide chasm? How do I make it across this bridge that's exploding before I have time to run across it?).If you like action games, pick this up."

This isn't what defines the game. This is simply a wraping on top of a PHENOMENAL shooter, and what is probably the best game I've played this year.I just spent the last 5 hours playing with complete strangers on the internet to beat this game at 3AM Christmas Day, and it's been a blast. There were frustrations with glitches, lag, and the usual, but then it came down to the final boss, which is absurdly difficult. It killed my 2 teamates within a minute. I then, somehow, managed to take it down single handedly through what has to be one of the most harrowing experiences of my life. It is through this afterglow that I am writing this review.Buy the game. It's more fun than just about anything else."

For a game that started as a gamejam project, I have loved watching it come all this way. I have been playing since it first came out pretty much, and before greenlight was a thing. I have played more hours than I actually have because of this. Playing split screen is a great experience as there is no lag, everything is right and fun however it gets a bit hectic, but that's part of the fun.Multiplayer online however, is a different story. In levels where you need to rush to the exit, if theres someone straying behind then it will cause the entire team to fail because you are stuck by the borders and cannot see anything that's happening, likewise for the opisate. Another issue with multiplayer are the bugs. I've encountered one where it's a black screen with a couple characters moving and then going to the bottom left when joining a server, and in that screen if you click drop out it can drop out player one (Very trolly, and annoying.) There are also a couple good bugs or tricks that allow you to get insanly high speeds over flat areas, have multiple boomerangs and even flying sometimes *patched.*Occasionally, the server cannot keep track of the bullets and you get hit by one on the hosts screen, but by air on yours, which is very annoying.But that's some of the negatives to start out, now lets go into the positives:+Addicting/fun+Mayhem everywhere+Many features+Hours of playtime+Casual game+Amazing level editor+Many, MANY, MANY more things."

Also the first character you'll play as..The Broad (The Bride/Uma Thurman from Kill Bill), a sword wielding bro (which makes little sense (the bro part that is)) who is incredibly fast paced, and difficult to get used to at times..Mr Anderbro (Neo/The One/Keanu Reeves and  his Keanu Reeves face), who lets his explosive and superfast fists do all the talking. Also, by using the melee attack that would normally summon a knife or something, Mr Anderbro speeds forward, either smashing through/into a wall, and/or knocking enemies straight out of the way with hilarious effect..Brogiver (Macgiver), someone who can throw an infinite amount of TNT and TNT laced turkeys at his foes, as well as climb up walls using gum. However, whilst the gum thing is odd, the real question is: Where on earth is Macgiver hiding all that TNT? Down his throat? Inside of a infinite bag? Inside his a**? Is it jammed into his c**k so that his c**k now fires TNT? Guess we'll never know....Ash Broliams (Ash Williams/That one guy with a chainsaw for a hand). Groovy.However, as fun as Broforce is, it still has it's kinks. For a start, Broforce is a tad overpriced. A price like £8-10 would likely suit it a bit better. Also, the game can be brotally difficult sometimes (yes I just made a pun, go back and check), due to the fact that one bullet can kill you. Yes, thats right. ONE BULLET. However, contrary to what you're probably thinking, this doesn't annoy me one little bit, (well, maybe a LITTLE bit) as this helps to counter the various bros unbelievable amount of power. However, this doesn't account for the fact that the bros' destructive nature (I'm looking at you Macgiver) can sometimes destroy the map so badly, you cannot continue. Another problem is that whilst it is possible to complete all the levels with all the bros, some bros are hilariously ill equiped for some levels (So no Macgiver, an a** that fires TNT doesn't get you anywhere in life), leading to a lot of frustrating retries. For example, there were two seperate levels that both involve sections where you are effectively gangbanged by a very large group of enemies (Xenomorphs to be precise), and certain bros (MACGIVER!!!) simply cannot survive the experience (F**KIN MACGIVER I'LL TEAR YOUR USELESS A** APART). However, the great thing about broforce is, for every bad life, they'll be a rather satisfying one shortly after. Going back to my example with the surprise Xenomorph fellatio party, after they jumped onto Macgiver and his explosive wonder-a**, with one life left, I was switched to another bro: B.A. Broacus AKA Mr T. Who had the headbutting prowess of a master. And a motherf**king flamethrower.Lets just say... I pity the acid-blooded fool (I also burn them alive)!All in all, Broforce is a beer keg of fun being drunk by a bald eagle. MERICA!!! F**K YEAH!!!9/10 Relatively worth the price (though expensive), banged whilst high.P.S. All it needs now is the Brovahkiin :) ."

There is more, but if I were continue the reader would actually perish in red, white and blue colored fireworks, out of a sheer excitement and patriotism.The game is a 2D platformer shoot’em up, not to different from the likes of Metal Slug, where all the characters are old action hero movie protagonist, and the only thing left to shoot is terrible, terrible, terrorists. You wanted to play Arnie as he was in ""Commando"" well here ya go, totally in there, Rocket launcher in tow and pain-a-plenty.The game features a lengthy campaign filled with a large variety of environments for you to stretch your creativity and bullet dispensing skills. and you're probably thinking, ""creativity? I thought I was going to blow everything up!"" and YOU mysterious reader, isn’t wrong, but the game's chaotic nature permits to go through stages through different ways, “OH man is it like one of those random genera-“ NO IT ISN’T, but you can create different paths yourself. Be it by shooting the environment, creating holes and passages for you to sneak way past enemies or you can bomb everything and watch as all them fear-inducing, gun-wielding, ski-mask wearing jerks fall into their demise, or punch their face, in the face. best part of this glorious mess, it can be done with up to 4 players, online and/or locally.the list of characters is pretty extensive  and it is cool to recognize the majority of them. sadly most of these freedom fueled fighters of justice, come from around the era of the early 90s and 80s, and as a result the game works better on older audiences, which may spot better the references.Their tools of freedom are slightly simpler than you think. All characters have a ""shoot"" a ""grenade"" and a ""melee."" of course each of these is completely different for each champion of steel and lead, and to add to the mix, you don’t get to choose your freedom fighters, instead they are selected at random (once they are unlocked). while not exactly amazing, the concept of losing your favorite for some lesser god of liberty, is an interesting way to spike the difficulty or force change in strategy, trough variety. and if you dont like, well tough luck, cus then you ain't got the force of the bros in you.The game is tough, it is fun, filled to the brim with characters from a glorious era and a myriad of explosions. so how about pick up your dream of Americanizing the world and make it true, With or Without friends!"

Frankly, it’s bloody fantastic (and spectacularly bloody).Unforgiving but (mostly) fair, frantic yet tactical, and oozing with 16-bit 2D charm, if Broforce had been released two decades ago I expect it probably would’ve been the greatest thing to happen to gaming back then. To me Broforce remains an incredibly confident, refined, unique, and content-rich run ’n gun shooter for up to four co-op players to this very day.StoryThe objective of most levels is simple; you just need to blast and/or dart your way through several different locations and very literally get to the chopper. Some of the later levels change this up somewhat as the enemies segue from enemy soldiers to aliens, and later again to supernatural nasties.MechanicsMechanics are fairly simple : normal enemies die in 1 shot ; you die in 1 shot. Broforce’s nearly completely destructible environments makes for really interesting engagements. Blast through walls to access buildings and get the drop on the enemies inside, or fire through the ground itself to tunnel beneath potential engagements.CharactersThe large team of varied bros themselves are the big stars, and there are plenty of them. Rambro, Brommando, B.A. Broracus, Double Bro Seven, The Brofessional; by now you’re probably picking up on the theme. Every single bro has its unique ability and weapons. Some are melee-focused, some have powerful, short-range weapons, some can fire longer distances, and some are unfortunately completely useless.ControlsControls are fully customizable. Your bro can shoot, climb walls, crouch, sprint...GameplayYou run around and kill people or aliens. When you die if you have lives (you can see how many you have in bottom left of the screen) you are forcibly swapped to a random new bro. You can get more lives by saving people in cages (by deastroying the cage)MultiplayerYou can make you own levels, play with people online or play community made maps.OverallIf you like silly andAMERICANrun 'n gun platformer this is a game for you! If you have some friends this game will be forth your money. Singleplayer is about 16 hours long (depending on how good you are). There are some really hard achivements if you want a challenge.

The developers had ideas, put them together, and pulled it off perfectly.The character design looks great, and is so innovative, despite the fact that they're all characters from movies and TV shows. They all have to be used in different ways in order to utilize them in the best way. They even managed to take 5 characters whose weapons are all swords, and made them work in entirely different way.The animations are amazing too. Lots of blood and explosions coming from everywhere! The battles against the terrorists pretty much gets as complex as 'The one with the most weapons wins', and I'm completely okay with that.Any drawbacks? Well, yes. The level editor is pretty good, but setting triggers is very confusing, and annoying at times. But overall, this game is excellent and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes explosions, and action movies.I rate this game:Testosterone/10."

However the entire concept of this game revolves around running and gunning, killing everything, but when you die with one hit it feels like I'm being punished for playing the game the way I'm supposed too. One minute I'm on a killing streak as Rambro, only to be hit by an exploding canister that fell on me from off screen. Now I am Brochete, who is still awesome, but not who I wanted to play as. Now I have to save a hostage, and instead of being Brobo Cop, the character I was lucky to get at the start of the missiob, I am someone completely different, who I don't like.The entire playthrough of this game I enjoyed MOST of it. When I was going on a crazy rampage as the character I wanted, I was extremely happy. When I spawned as my favorite character, only to save one hostage and be replaced with my least favorite? Not as much.Take all this as you will.

The campaign mode (still a work-in-progress like the rest of the game) starts out small - you've got a couple of bros to play as, and the levels are short and sweet affairs with minor explosivity and a gentle learning curve. However, the levels soon become massive, beautiful layers of falling structure and exploding barrels filled with many hapless terrorists - and their many, many stray bullets. Be prepared to die; it's going to happen a lot.The playable 'Bros' are the heart of the game's charm: each is a loving shoutout to an 80's or 90's character, and each come equipped with their own weapon and special ability. It's great to see all these homages in one game, and especially one whose pixel graphics and over-the-top demeanor make it believeable.The fully-destructible environments are a great feature, though to the unwary: death. As I said before, you will die a LOT. If there's not an explosion going off at any given moment, eating away at the level, you probably haven't started moving yet. With many structures physics-enabled, as well as all explosions having the possibility of causing a chain reaction, Broforce is a 1 million on the Hectic Scale.I've never played a game that oozes patriotic spirit like this one does. Buy it, play it, DELIVER DEMOCRACY."

Wonderdodge,"Mericatl;drAspectScoreGameplay9/10Story5/10Multiplayer8/10Controller or kb/m?ControllerFinal score7/10Buy it?Only on saleGameplay: 9/10Arcade style game play. You're typically deployed into a hostile area where you shoot people/blow up things indiscriminately.It's clear the game was heavily influenced by Metal Slug. You start out as Rambro (a play on Rambo and Broforce) and you progress through each mission, which simply involved killing everything and sometimes killing a boss. The coolest thing about this game is that, like Metal Slug, you also have to free POWs, butunlikeMetal Slug, you unlock characters as you unlock said POWs.So you start with Rambro, but then after one or a couple freed POWs, you unlock B.A. Broracus (they're all named like that). And as you progress through the ""story,"" it takes more and more POWs to unlock a new character. Also, as you free POWs you get extra lives, and with the game increasing in difficulty as you go, you'll need those extra lives to make it through the levels.The interesting thing about the gameplay is that you would think you should always unlock POWs, right? Well, as you progress, the characters you unlock have increasingly more interesting abilties/guns. So, sometimes you may want to hold onto Mr. Anderbro (it really should've been just ""Nebro,"" ... come on, man) to finish the level for you, and then before you exit the level, go back and get the POWs so you aren't stuck with a less-preferred character. It's a neat little dynamic - should you risk not having extra lives to wreck shop for the rest of the level (but then get hit once or a few times and die earlier), or lose your character, get the extra life, but potentially be stuck with someone you don't particularly like? It's cool because it forces you to learn how to play with all characters and strategize for each one, which is an unexpected surprise for a game with such simple concepts.Also, there are some missions that allow you to unlock new usuable items, and many of these levels require that you only have one life and use one character. It adds a little spice to a game that doesn't try to be anything more than it is: a shoot 'em up with very little story that's played for the pure enjoyment of the arcade-style play.The boss fights are cool. Early boss fights are fairly easy, and later boss fights get kinda ridiculous, but what else can you expect?Story: 5/10While the score is average, honestly, this isn't the reason you play a game like this, and the devs knew that. I gave it that score because they didn't try to give it a story, butfor a game like this, that's fine. But it does get a little extra boost from a couple things - they did give you a reason for why you're doing what you're doing ...FOR FREEDOMAnd they made a comedic play on this. I guffawed pretty hard when I read for a particular country, the reason they gave for the mission was something to the effect of:Their culture and language is different from ours.What are you waiting for?!So this game ends up being a satire/sarcastic commentary on our own real-life American culture of generally not trying to understand other cultures but rather expecting other cultures to assimilate into ours. Way to go with the comedy, devs!Other than that though, you just go to an area, shoot everything, and leave.Also think it's neat that they didn't discriminate. You also have women ""bros"" to unlock too, and they made a great choice with ""Ellen Ripbro.""Multiplayer 8/10There isn't much to say about this. Another game that's better played with friends. If I'm not mistaken, you can play locally with more than one controller, or online. And you can play with up to four people. Pretty cool caveat, though the screen gets a little crowded with four people in the midst of all the destruction.Controller or kb/mI think it's plausible to play this game with kb/m, but it's easier to play with a controller. Steam controller works fine for it, but it gives no added plus or minus for such a simple game.The VerdictBest enjoyed on-sale. Arcade, 2D sidescroller that's a good distraction. Could be picked up/put down with relative ease. Could have more depth, but gameplay overshadows that. 'Merica."

Just shut your brain off and enjoy the glory. But, seriously, this is a fantastic, fast paced throw back to games like Contra and Metal Slug. Tight controls, and a large selection of unique characters makes this one of the best retro inspired games to date. It's difficult in spots, but never unfair. The only frustration I ran into were a few of the optional challenge levels. Overall though, one of most entertaining games I've played.

You're an explosion that explodes explosions at exploding explosions until all the explosions explode. In other words, it's awesome. Action mayhem at its finest. The big problem is, when everything is an explosion, it can be challenging to keep track of yourself. Turning on ""always show player balloons"" or whatever it was called is a big help, but I think my number one killer was having a big rock fall on me while I was machinegunning hundreds of terrorists to death. Furthermore the checkpoints seem to usually not do anything? In singleplayer anyway. There are definitely a few occasions where the difficulty is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, too, but really it's nothing horribly unmanagable, particularly since dying generally has very little real consequence.Totally play this with bros if you can. Finessing the menus is sort of a pain, but the netcode seems pretty stable once you're up and going, and more guns is almost always better.

FOR 'MURICA AND FOR FREEDOM, you liberate the world by destroying everything.The game is a platformer  with fully destructible environment and don't get fooled by the pixel graphics, murdering terrified terrorists and setting up huge chain-reaction explosions looks great at 60 fps.The campaign is long and has plenty of re-playability thanks to the ""random bro"" system and even if you get tired of it there's THOUSANDS of custom campaigns for free on the workshop.Plus, if you love challenges, there's also an ""IronBro"" mode which is ""nintendo hard"".However, Broforce is even greater when played in coop.You can use controllers, but you can also play with a buddy on single keyboard.You can play all sorts of modes with your bros, including an hilarious ""Deathmatch"" mode and a ""Race"" mode.Finally, devs are easy going, ever present on the Steam forums and strongly anti-DLC scumming: they are still updating and expanding the game for free, also adding new Bros.I paid this game 14 € and it was really a steal for the amount of content.

,Recommended,274190,33194458,Posted: 3 July,all,Doctor Pyro,"Broforce is a game I can’t believe didn’t already exist – South African developer Free Lives has righted a mighty wrong here. Bursting at the seams with veiny biceps and draped in American flags, Broforce is a love letter to action cinema carved into lead, fired into the corpse of the nearest copy of Contra, and then brought to life via dark magic. It’s so obvious, really; a squad of Earth’s greatest heroes (and heroines)  – most of whom are only a typo away from a thick wad of cease-and-desist letters – against the worst that international terrorism, the galaxy, and the underworld itself can throw at humanity. Frankly, it’s bloody fantastic (and spectacularly bloody).Unforgiving but (mostly) fair, frantic yet tactical, and oozing with 16-bit 2D charm, if Broforce had been released two decades ago I expect it probably would’ve been the greatest thing to happen to me since puberty. In 2015 the effect is a little less life-altering, but Broforce remains an incredibly confident, refined, unique, and content-rich run ’n gun shooter for up to four co-op players.The objective of most levels is simple; you just need to blast and/or dart your way through several different locations and very literally get to the chopper. Some of the later levels change this up somewhat as the enemies segue from enemy soldiers to aliens, and later again to supernatural nasties, but that’s the general gist. I love how hilariously dim-witted the regular enemy mooks are but, as just one shot will kill you, you still need to play with precision. The difficulty spikes a few times across the final campaign stages, but it’s certainly in step with the sorts of games that have clearly inspired it. My only major criticism is that I noted some odd slowdown during a couple of periods where a great many alien enemies had pinned themselves in a small area on screen.Welcome to the Party, PalBroforce’s nearly completely destructible environments put a creativity-enabling twist on proceedings. Blast through walls to access buildings and get the drop on the baddies inside, or fire through the ground itself to tunnel beneath potential engagements. I found that particularly useful against the large, fire-spitting, worm-like bosses; you can create tunnels to get right up against the still-buried parts of their bodies and use the intact terrain above to temporarily protect you from their ranged attacks.The sheer amount of explosive objects on screen means destruction gets pretty wild with other players involved so I’ve actually found myself preferring to play it solo, where you control the pace yourself. There’s also a dedicated deathmatch mode for those of you who’d rather work against one another than together; it’s perhaps a little too chaotic for my tastes, but it’s a laugh in short bursts. Beyond that there’s even an intimidating level editor, but if you’re too daunted to try that out you can simply browse through and quickly and easily load community-made levels.The large team of varied bros themselves are the big stars, and there are plenty of them. Rambro, Brommando, B.A. Broracus, Double Bro Seven, The Brofessional; by now you’re probably picking up on the theme. The bros are quick and nimble and there’s a good level of nuance in the controls; bros can grab walls and climb indefinitely, and automatically execute a handy flip when you’re trying to jump up and around a ledge above. They’re little more than small blobs of pixels, but the way in which each has been lovingly imagined and crafted is evident in the art that splashes on screen each time you unlock a new bro and the quaint little animated profile pics.Clearly Scotland's greatest American action hero.Clearly Scotland's greatest American action hero.Hasta la Vista, BabyWhat’s particularly great about Broforce is that every time you die you’re forcibly swapped to a random new bro, and each of them has distinctly different weapons and abilities and require a different approach. Some are melee-focused, some have powerful, short-range weapons, some can fire longer distances, and at least one seems completely useless (yes, I’m speaking about you, Brocketeer). Some are better at using their speed to scamper past clumps of enemies, and some have the firepower to duke it out with the baddest of bad guys. Some are faster at chewing through the destructible scenery to create new paths and avoid conflicts and traps, and some have incredibly potent secondary abilities.Every time you’ll spawn as a new bro who might be better suited to the challenge ahead.Several of my favourite bros are amongst the latter; Time Bro can slow down time to a crawl (extremely handy against bosses), Brominator has an endoskeleton form that makes him temporarily invulnerable, and Bro Heart’s “Freedom” battle cry sends enemies running (perfect if you’re being swarmed). I often wished I could swap to my preferred bro at will, especially prior to some of the tougher bosses, but I do concede that making do with the abilities of your given bro is part of the fun. It certainly takes the edge off of repeated failures, knowing that every time you’ll spawn as a new bro who might be better suited to the challenge ahead. The fact that rescuing hostages gains you an extra life but changes your on-screen bro (and is the way you unlock new bros) also creates an interesting risk-reward dynamic; do I trade Time Bro for the extra life and a random new character, or do I stick it out?I gleaned a great deal of joy discovering the more subtle characteristics of the bros, too. The way the Brodator’s spears stay lodged in the environment for you to jump on, or the way his body explodes if he’s defeated in battle. The way the death of one of the Boondock Bros (who come as a pair, or a trio alongside their father if you activate him) enrages the surviving brother and causes him to flash red and fire his pistols far more rapidly. The fact that the Chuck Norris-inspired Brodell Walker’s melee attack is a roundhouse kick, or that Time Bro’s is a classic JCVD split kick. Broforce is a parody done with a lot of reverence.Ash Brolliams even drops into later levels alongside an exploding Oldsmobile.Ash Brolliams even drops into later levels alongside an exploding Oldsmobile.I also really love Broforce’s attention to the smaller details of its presentation, from the way the profile pics of each bro bounce as they run and are lit up with muzzle flashes as they fire their weapons, to the enemy kill count at the end of each level (which is usually a conga line of exploding bodies, like nuking a large group of tightly-packed Lemmings). I highly rate the sound, in particular the pitch-perfect glam rock guitar score and hilarious enemy squeals and death gurgles and its constantly screaming narrator.0."

,Recommended,274190,16894892,"Posted: 5 July, 2015",all,Florida Hans,"Broforce, despite its caranage, american, and action, is a game that does make you sit down and think about the situation which arre all reflected on the you have and how the terrain is set up. You can play it safe by blowing the hell out of terrain, and walk around the enemies, or you can go in and swiftly mow them down. It really adds that action movie feel that the game is trying to emulate and it does a damn fine job at doing so, much helped by its buttery smooth controls making the action more immserive and more impressive when explosive schtuff is happening. Plus the game's replay value is endless is with the level editor mode, and custom-campaigns, leaving always more room for some Broforce! However, if one is looking for a challenge, Broforce's main campaign might not be very satisfying, and I would recommend getting Expendabros a try, not for its challenge, but as a way to test to see if the gameplay is still fun for the person in mind, and hence can just try out the challenging maps in the custom-campaigns. Broforce is a damn fine game, it's a kickass and respectful tribute to both the run n' gun genre and action movies in general. Free Lives is constantly helping to make the game more balanced and refined, so go get this game, gather some bros, and blow up some terrorists."

The only problem I find with this game is the occasional crash.

A force of Bros bro'ing their force all over generic brown-people's faces.Broforce is a side-scrolling high-intensity shooter with an emphasis on big explosions, absurd weaponry, and shout outs to an era of action films rife with stereotypical alpha male behavior. The mechanics are simple enough to grasp and the actual number of buttons required to play could be thrown on an SNES controller with buttons to spare.You and a number of friends will zip across short to somewhat long Bionic Commando-like levels as you decimate enemies within stages before the the inevitable boss battle takes place.There's a great deal going on visually and the smooth pixelated look goes well with the theme of the game. Sound is pretty solid and captures the gnarliness of Arnold swinging a Conan sized greatsword whilst lamentations continue in the background. The controls can be a bit twitchy and the deadzone for certain controllers may cause some players to fall to their death a few times before getting the hang of things.I found myself surprised and disappointed by the one-hit kill system in place for your character as there is often so much flying across the screen that it's easy to not realize one pixel is a bullet about to take you down. Constant and erratic movement does help somewhat but you'll likely need to memorize and play through tougher levels via trial and error before nailing the more difficult missions. It's a fun local and online shooter with decent online community so give it a shot.CHECK OUT MORE GAME REVIEWS AThttps://ethnographix.squarespace.com/"

It had some similarities to super meat boy with the pixelized art style, frantic speed and the timed runs through each level.  It was pretty light and there were some legitimately funny moments along the way.  The early game was the most entertaining for me since it was the most reminiscent of the 80's movies they're trying to parody. Killing bad guys in a jungle by blowing up barrels and shooting machine guns with tons of explosions going off was a great time.However, i did have some frustrating moments too. I personally felt like some of the playable characters were kind of useless because of their given weapons (grenade throw rather than gun for instance) and since you're randomized as to who you'll get with each life you use, RNG can kind of waste your time occasionally. Also, the final 'zone' of the game felt like it dragged on forever. I thought i'd reached the final boss encounter easily a half dozen times during that finale.Overall i had a lot more fun than frustration and with the workshop support i can definitely see coming back to try out some user created shenanigens."

It was highly sucessful after it's release in 2014. The game is a throwback to action movies from the 1980s, through it's over-the-top action and intense gameplay. The game seems simple in design at first, but after playing for a while, you pick up on the attention to detail that makes this game such a gem.The controls are simple as well, making it easy to pick up and play. The game runs smoothly and you really feel like a movie hero, slicing and dicing through hoards of no name grunts. As the game goes on, both the game itself and the player made maps (which I'll cover in a moment) add a level of challenge, keeping the game fresh.As well as the pre-made maps the game comes with, it also has a built in map editor where players can create their own maps to share on the Steam workshop. By being able to share maps, the game maintains a level of mystery. Some maps are made to be played with a somewhat stealthy playstyle by using tunnels and multiple routes and ways to complete maps, whereas others encourage you to go all out, guns blazing, and blow as much stuff up as you can!In my opinion, the game is best played in co-op. As much fun as it is to run around as MacGyver or Chuck Norris on your own, having a buddy along for the ride just adds to the hilarity that ensues when you play a map or two... or three... five...The only downside I find to the game was that I just burned myself out. I was having so much fun planting explosives and hip firing that I would just play... and play. The game loses it's appeal after a while. This is not a game you'll sit down and play for hours to level up your character, or build that new house, or go on that raid. This game is purely for the fun aspect. Apart from that there's a total lack of story, but eh. EXPLOSIONS!!!!Final Ratings:Graphis: As a throw back to the retro, the graphics breathe life into the old style of game design. They're not next gen, but they're sure as hell prettier :P. Also runs better than next gen.Gameplay: Broforce is fast paced and over the top. It doesn't have deep game mechanics, but I think we all love a bit of shoot-em-up.Story: What story?End result: I give Broforce a solid 7.5 outta teyyan."

I wish they made it longer :(Now on to the official part of the review:PROS:➴ Fun action-packed levels keep you asking for more➴ Features 10 or more diffrent bros based on popular movies and games➴ Level creator for gamers who still like to play the game (or make one....)➴ Props that you can use to destroy the environment like propane tanks, exploding barrels etc.➴ Each bro has his or her own special weapon and unique ability➴ Awesome bosses you get to take down➴ 4 diffrent game modesCONS:➴ The bosses might be little too difficult➴ You get killed if atleast one bullet hits you➴ You can kill yourself (i wouldn't recommend it but if you want to try....knock yourself out)Broforce (as i said before) is an action-packed sidescrolling shooter with a wide variety of of weapons, characters, enemies, and bosses. You are a bro who is trying to fight against some evil buisness guy.....who appereantly has an army of terrorist at his side. Fight through hordes of terrorist, dismantle terrorist base, and destroy evil generals all with your bros, the environment around you, and your wits. Invade South Korea with tons of guns that come with your special bro and destroy litterly everything without any compassion or guilt for your foes. There is even a multiplayer mode where you can team up to kill and destroy everything in South Korea so you can save lives. Revive and arm fallen soldiers that will head into the battle and kill themselves without thinking at all. Broforce is awesome. Get it now!Is the review helpful? if it is, put a like and follow me here:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dreaderisawesome#curation"

To take down Satan's evil army of mooks, demons, and maybe other things I probably don't remember. This game is one if the most brutal games I ever played. Don't worry. It just blood, guts, and explosions. Not the beginning of like Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 brutal (that one part where the robot gets ahold of your arms... It actually hurts my arms just thinking about it).THE GAMEPLAY: There are approximately 30 bros to rescue and use, 30! But you can't choose your bro however, the bro that gets sent out is random. Unless you are doing custom levels and someone disables every bro expect one... More on custom compatibility later. The game itself is a run-and-gun game where there is no complicated controls, just jump, shoot, melee, and special. There are techniques like wall climbing, running, maybe more, but I don't remember easily. The controls are neat and responsive, and feels good to use. There is nothing else to say there. You shoot and kill terrorists, but shooting is not always the answer. Don't forget to use your melee when you need it. You can also shoot propane tanks, TNT and stuff like that to kill your enemies. Hell, use some falling rocks if you have to. A boss might appear in a level, so, well, you know what to do. KEELKEELKEELKEELKEEL. There is a lot of breakable terrain in this game. Take advantage of alternate paths by digging your way via your awesome weapon!THE STORY: You probably already know, Satan evil kill him STORY. Just listen to the theme song instead.THE MUSIC: Some songs are awesome, while the rest is filler for when doing a stage, but that's okay. I don't expect something awesome for a regular stage.CUSTOM COMPATIBILITY: There are custom stages you can make, upload, and download. It's awesome but alas, it is ONLY stages you can make, not custom bros and stuff. But what can you expect, this game already has 30 of them! You can lock certain bros from levels so they don't appear if you wish. If you wanna know more about level creation. There are guides for that. If you wanna know what you CAN do, let's just say that whatever you see in the main game can be placed in this. If you are gonna review this section, review individual stages (not all of them) because it depends on the work of the PLAYER, NOT THE DEVELOPER.SOME OTHER THINGS: Depending on your specs will depend on the speed. Just do expect lag for some cluttered parts. That's the case for me anyway. Don't be using your special attack so often. It can be bad. What should I say next... I actually don't know. Sorry.SCORE: 9.24/10 It's an awesome game definitely worth checking out. If you don't like this game, I don't like YOU."

Buy it on sale, although buying Broforce at full price is not so bad if you are craving a good 'ol explode 'em up.other points- You can play Broforce with a keyboard, but you won't be as good as someone with a gamepad.- 4 person co-op local or online or any combination of both- it's a bit too hard to focus when there are 3 or more people playing- Steam Workshop is fully integrated into the game for hours of extra content- approx 300mb download- The difficulty is reasonable. This is not a super hard game unless you are doing one of the achievement challenges."
76561197963629592,Recommended,274190,24184267,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,bigorangemachine,I have only put 5 hours into this game and it single handedly gave me a reason to buy a steam link.  The small file size decieves how much fun is packed into this game.While I've put it down to play other more 'long tail' games; I am constantly telling fellow gamers just how legit this game is and how quickly you'll burst out laughing mid game while you fall prey to lame bro deaths after leaving swaths of corpses in your wake or while you tunnel beneath a boss to avoid certain death.If you don't like this game or you can't get the satire that drips off the pixels; you just have no sense of humour.  If you are a fan of 'cult action movies' then you'll see the subtle parallels with movies such as 'Hot Shots Part Deux'.For its low cost it was well worth the 5 hours of PURE LAUGHTER this game brought me.  While somtime was spent stuck in bug land while trying to play multiplayer.... but once I connected with some random bros it was 10x the fun as single player.
,Recommended,274190,28607399,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,El_Buhdai,"After beating Broforce for the second time since I bought it maybe a year ago, I'm ready to review this thing. Spoiler free.I'll be dividing this review into 3 sections: Pros, Notes, and Cons. Pros are what people could generally agree would be good for what this game wants to be, Notes are things that people may like or dislike based on preference, and Cons are what people would generally agree are bad in a game. Most of the reviews here are jokes or memes, so I'm gonna give a real one. Let's get right into it while I'm still pumped up by the ending of this game!Pros:- AWESOME, Dynamic Gameplay! : The controls are smooth and once you get used to them, it plays like a dream. The cast of bros and enemies are diverse enough to keep you wanting more interaction with them throughout the game. The destructable terrain makes leaping away from exploding enemies, throwing them over a ledge into enemies below, or blasting holes in walls and pulping everyone on the other side all the more satisfying. The carefully placed explosive barrels and tanks also create some extremely epic chain explosions, and some crazy and HILARIOUS chain reactions can happen naturally that the developers didn't even script in there. Finally, if things are about to get crazy, you can high-five your fellow bro at any time to get a few moments of slow motion!- It started in Early Access, and actually escaped it! Not only that, but it escaped it in a state so awesome that no one could have expected it after all the other games that failed through EA. I must admit that I pirated a really early version of the game, but I enjoyed it so much that I felt guilty for stealing it and bought it (I never pirated again, by the way). When I got the full version, I was expecting some extra levels similar to the ones early in the game, and that's about it. However, what I got was a much more polished game, WAY more levels, and a complete 80's - 90's action movie story with no depth at all, featuring generic terrorists, explosions for no real reason, blood, destruction, and American arrogance and stereotypes on steroids! The developers knew that the formula from early on in the game would get old, too, so they kick it up a few notches toward the middle by COMPLETELY changing the threat, and build it up toward a massive grand ending that could not be any more epic even if theytried.- FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! WITH VIBRATIONS!!!! : I rarely use controllers to play games on my PC (actually I never do unless I'm playing a local multiplayer game with my brother), but after playing this locally with him, and feeling the vibration support, I haven't played without one since. After you get used to it, I'd say it plays even better with a controller.- The graphics are amazing, and this is a game I could point to for excellence in graphics in the indie genre. This game is also solid proof that a game doesn't need to have modern graphics to have good graphics. From the pixel art in-game, to the drawings on the cut scenes, the art in this game looks so great that I forget I'm looking at pixel art. On top of that, they threw in some post-processing effects so you're not just staring at sprites the whole game. On top of that, there are subtle things like trees shaking in the background from explosions or bullets flying past them that make the game's universe solid and believable. The animations and the way they make things look like they're 3D/rotating makes this art some of the best I've seen in all games with a pixel art style. Period. That's saying something, because I own a lot of games with pixel art.- The sounds are clear, well mixed, and are always appropriate for whatever's happening in the game. Apparently, they hired a professional sound designer to remaster some of the sounds in the game awhile back, and the quality shows.- ALL THE MULTIPLAYER AND GAMEMODES YOU COULD EVER WANT. Local, Online, and Online + Local. You can play several gamemodes including the campaign all with up to 4 players. Just playing singleplayer can be crazy, and two can be complete chaos, so I can only imagine what a 4-player experience is like... I think I played it once but I don't remember it. Must've blacked out lol.- This game is more than just a dumb mindless action game. It's clear how much effort and attention was put into this game to make a full experience.- More ""HOLY ****!!!!"" moments (ranging from things created by the developers to experiences that just happened as I was playing) than I could put in an entire seperate review without exceeding the character limit. I'd advise you not to look at IGN's reviews or too many other reviews on Steam. Just dive in head-first with some buddies.- Even if you don't like some of the content, or you've completed it all, the developers have given you the very level editor they've used to make their levels directly in-game (hooray for not having to be forced to visit the developers' website...). I don't know how easy it is to use, but it should be alright considering how many maps and campaigns are being made all the time. (EDIT: I have used the editor since the time of writing this review and it is solid, and relatively easy to learn and use.) Once you open up the level maker, you can make a few and assemble them into a campaign, or download other people's creations from the workshop from directly in-game!- WORKSHOP SUPPORT!!!Notes:- Levels can sometimes be very challenging, and you might be restarting a lot to the point of desperation. So there IS challenge in this game, but it begins toward the middle.- Levels can be incredibly short. Like... from 1 - 3 minutes short with a single player, so again, I can only imagine what it's like with 4 players.- Loading times can be kind of long, say, maybe 30 seconds to a minute. However, to be honest I don't have a gaming computer, so you guys out there with powerful rigs should be fine. As a trade-off they load a bunch of levels at once (every level in the game's ""zones"") so the transition between them is almost instant. This can be based on preference I guess. Some people like to have the wait divided evenly, but I enjoy sacrificing some time before so my immersion isn't disturbed too much between levels.Cons:- If you've made it this far without purchasing the game, I'm disappointed in you. THERE ARE NO CONS UNLESS YOU COUNT THE ONE BUG I EXPERIENCED ONCE BUT NEVER SAW AGAIN. PURCHASE THIS GAME!!!The Verdict:Broforce is a fresh experience with great graphics, audio, and gameplay. More than just a dumb 90's action movie style game, Broforce is an example of AAA quality from an Indie team of developers. Its campaign is great, and with several other modes, a built-in level editor, and full workshop support, there's more than enough here to keep you coming back for more."

Like if you get upset that you can't play with your favorite character all the time, steer clear, steer very far clear. You also can gimp yourself by destroying a large portion of the level leading to the exit, because you can destroy like 99.99% of each level, and it's kinda hard if that destroyed portion is in your path to bloody victory.Also, you can have the random chuckle at how ridiculously stupid the game is, but in a good way.

This game plays very much like a finished product in single player and local co op, however online does need more work. Other than online not being finished, the developers seem to be using early access as more of an excuse to add more characters and levels to an already amazing game.Gameplay is fast paced, and you're constantly forced to switch up your playstyle, as rescuing your ""bros"" (which gives you lives/revives your teamates) changes you to a random character, with unique primary and secondary attacks. Killing enemies and bosses is always satisfying, with explosions everywhere and body parts and blood raining from the sky constantly. You always feel powerful. There is also a surprising amount of strategy involved. Depending on what abilities your current bro has, you need to always take the enemy by surprise, as even though the enemies are slow to react, they kill in one hit. This means you often have to use terrain destruction and platforming to flank the enemies.AI can be very dumb sometimes, suicide bombers and dogs will often run off cliffs and die of fall damage, however somehow this doesn't break immersion, as you feel clever and badass for exploiting them. The other minor negative is that its a very short game, however it has a lot of replayibilty as the visceral combat never gets old and you can play it with friends, kind of like Left 4 Dead campaigns.TL;DR: Broforce is an incredibly fun game with friends or by yourself, with enough visceral combat and action movie heroes to keep even the most bloodthirsty people happy. Now defend your second amendment rights and KILL SOME MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING TERRORISTS!!!"

It's like Bullet Hell, but with a lot more explosions. Seriously, there are a LOT of explosions. It's hack 'n slash sometimes, but every now and then you need to assess a situation instead of running in headfirst. Makes you think of strategies. Also this game is really funny. The ""bro"" puns in the hero's names, the names of the bosses, the setting. As the levels go on, it just gets progressively more hilariously over the top with explosions and you end up killing hordes of enemies at once. It's so much fun!I have a few complaints, though. In Ironbro mode, half the time your save gets corrupted when you get down to one life. Basic grunts sometimes shoot two bullets instead of one, which seems like a strange RNG-based element in an otherwise completely skill-based game. Kamakaze grunts also sometimes instantly explode, which is just plain unfair. Sky fortress is far too hard to beat without digging underground, which is just a cheap tactic anyway. Aaaaand that's actually it! Besides those little tweaks I'd make, this game is flipping perfect. The ultimate America simulator."

It pays a bit of homage, partially out of necessity to available “bros”, to all the biggest, best (and worst) action bros. Imagine if you could run around as the Terminator, Conan, and that one marine played by Arnold in the first Predator movie. Would that not be awesome (and CG heavy)?But again, as I said, bit of limitations. So far in playing (4 hours) I’ve unlocked only two non white dudes, BA and Blade specifically, and as odd as this is to say about a game about bros, only one girl, Ripley from the Alien movies. *Correction, I just unlocked Machete.Story: Like any good action movie, this is mostly about the great white hope showing up and dispensing freedom (IE: laying waste) to some generic terrorist looking dudes in... wait, Vietnam? Yeah, Vietnam. Along the way, you’ll also be saving fellow Bros, the more you save, the more Bros you get to play as.Gameplay: It’s mostly about going from area to area in successively more difficult levels and blowing the absolute hell out of everything in your path. Get ready to dispense freedom using shotguns, missiles, rockets, and yes, CHAINSAW HANDS. Also, get ready to die, A LOT.No seriously, I can’t stress that part enough. You are going to die darn nearly constantly. I was playing the Alpha Build, early access version on Steam and dear god did I burn through a lot of lives.The Good, The Bad, The Ugly: It is so awesome getting to play as one of your favorite heroes, and kinda disheartening how sucky some of them turn on in comparison to others. Seriously, Indiana Jones is less effective than Agent K. The Terminator is pretty much unplayable unless you got your back against a wall, which is pretty much the opposite of the point of being the Terminator.The Glitches: Ok, this is an Early Access, and an Alpha Build, so grain of salt with any complaints here. There was several times I died and there was absolutely nothing on screen. I was just sliding down a wall and died. The game also would experience slow downs (and the one guys power, or when a boss character showed up, just randomly the game would seriously slow down, sometimes all but freezing. The only pattern I really noticed was typically Walker, Texas Ranger and missiles were on the screen at the same time, but it did occasionally happen with other guys too.Final Verdict: Worth the money. Play it."
76561198166620870,Recommended,274190,20614397,"Posted: 18 January, 2016",all,DontBlink +_- UrDead,"Broforce is a classic retro side-scrolling action game featuring your favorite iconic characters from Hollywood  films.The game offers you brilliant platforming and fast paced shoot-em-up action, pitting you into environments which have destructable terrain making it more difficult for the player, forcing you to think about your every action strategically later on in the game, especially the harder levels.The 8-bit graphics match the consistency of the sound and music. Although the voice overs are much to over-used and you may get tired of hearing ""3... 2... 1... GO!!"" by the end of the game. In short, the graphics and sound are not anything spectacular, even for your average 8-bit indie game. What makes this game special is the gameplay and the wide array of characters which each have their own unique style and abilities.Love and hate. What some users don't particularly like about this game is that you can't ever choose the character you want to play as, the developers say they made the game randomly select characters for you to keep you on your toes. There are some times I wish I could be Predator or Blade (Wesley Snipes) for a whole level but sadly cannot. Thankfully, the vast array of characters makes up for this and the unlocking system makes you excited for who will be unlocked next.Life is hard. Even though your hero may br a bad-azz from a movie such as Terminator or The Matrix, you still die in one hit, one bullet is all it takes and you can also die from things falling on top of you, or even debris from explosions. There are also plenty of mini-bosses and bosses in the game to keep the player on their toes.You can play up to 4-player local co-op or online. I, personally, played through the game alone and still had a blast. Try this if you are a movie buff or enjoy 2D games with destruction.This review was based on the current build as of writing.

,Not Recommended,274190,28877856,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Don Derelict,"Fun to play, when it works. I'm strictly talking about the coop campaign. It seems as if it was made for console but released on PC first.  Menu controls are atrocious with mouse and keyboard and often mislabeled with controller keys. Game wants you to use a controller really, really bad.In coop players joining the host will often have horrible ping/lag spikes that make the game nearly unplayable. Sometimes they will be able to join the match but not actually be able to play and only be able to talk in chat; this is usually fixed by both the host and joiners restarting the game entirely. Can't join friends through Steam, can only join by searching game lobby.The camera is a nightmare when two players go to opposite sides of the screen. It will expand the screen to a point, but then stops so the players are outside of the viewport. You then have to try and blindly get back inside so you can actually see your characters.The most damaging problem is the save slots. They're either bugged or broken or...something. We had an 80+% completed campaign going and then one day we logged back in to find it was at 27%, and two other 0% slots magically appeared that none of us created. So it wiped all of our progress and now we have to restart. This has happened multiple times. It randomly changes the progress of your save. BROKEN.So when the game actually works, it's a hoot! Lots of fun and humor. Gameplay feels good, very explosive and responsive.  But it has so many bugs and glaring issues that I wouldn't recommend it til they're fixed."

Everything is blown up and falling out of the map is the only solution. This setting is just stupid.

This game has more 'Murika than a Alabama fourth of July celebration at a McDonalds parking lot with a keg of Miller Light and ten tons of fireworks!

It takes action shooting hints from Metal Slug and Contra and adds a level of humor and lovely artistic style to it. Some of the graphics feel a little repetetive, but there's alot of variety in the ""bros"" you play and their guns and special abilities. The killing is both visceral and humerous and it doesn't suffer from a slowdown in action at any point. There's just so much style and awesomeness in this game that you can't help but feel manly while playing it.The game allows for up to four players both local and online, guarnteeing awesome fun with friends. And custom levels means this game will definitley be enjoyable for a wihle.Do I think it's worth $15? Probably not 15. Wait for it to come down on sale to $10, but definitley pick this one up.

There are lots of talented community map makers who make great maps to play after the main campaign is finished; however, I feel like the campaign should have a level select feature so the player can replay a level to unlock future bros rather than restarting the entire campaign. This could be just me but I seem to have a bug where if not launched from steam, the game will not run properly.List of new bros that I think should be added:-Bro Skywalker (Luke or Anakin Skywalker)-Fast movement speed, high jumps-Lightsabre for standard attack, deflect bullets, can be held in front to deflect a number of bullets-The Force for special, pushes enemies infrantfront of him away, killing them in the process, also works on missiles, recharge over time.-Harry Brotter (Harry Potter)-Confringo for standard attack, explodes enemies or the block it is pointed to-Avada Kadavra for special, enemies die instantly without any blood or visual harm, limited to 3-Sword of Gryffindor for melee, enemies slowly die from poison if not killed by sword-Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan-DC/Marvel Characters if possible"

It doesn't take itself seriously and mocks the hyper-american movies by making their ""bro"" counterparts. The gameplay is still slightly buggy (this is early access) but has no major annoying bugs. The artstyle is reminiscent to Hotline Miami (which I loved) and the hyperviolence brings homeage to that. One thing that slightly annoyed me was that the soundtrack wasn't as memorable (or maybe the explosions were too loud) and couldn't jack up my testosterone levels like Hotline Miami. The characters are flavourful and design and pay homage to their real life counterparts in creative ways. This is definitely worth the price tag after they make this a full game."

Not only is there action, explosions and all that cool stuff, but there is also a hint of stealth thrown into there too. I would recommend this game to whoever likes a fun game with a crud ton of action in it. Also the campaign is fantastic, the levels of difficulty gradually get higher as you advance, and the action only gets better.Now onto the next subject, in the beginning I did have problems controls wise. For some reason the default controls were all screwed up, but I just deleted the game and re-downloaded it, and the default controls were fine. This game is in alpha and im sure that they will fix it in the future, but the multiplayer is REALLY laggy. I tried playing it with one of my friends and he would blow up something, and about ten minutes later a random explosion would go off. So, the players arent in sync what so ever.I would recommend buying this game, there will be a few bugs her and there, but it is in alpha so they will fix it eventually. Also, I couldn't find anything wrong with game than those two I talked about. And the first one on controls most likely wont happen to you, because out of the two other of my friends that bought this, I was the only one with that problem. The campaign is also one of the best i've ever played in a platformer. Overall its a great game and its only going to get better, so definetly buy it."

Pixaleted platforming, gunplay and co-op along with some nicely implemented workshop features, allows the game to have seemingly endless amounts of fun.I had tons of fun dying over and over, laughing at the comical moments that occurred all around me. Hell even the most basic enemy in the game would occasionally get a good shot in and send me to my grave. Never once did I get frustrated, as it was always my own fault. Soon after dying 20+ times you'll stumble upon an amazing run that ends the previously difficult level in a matter of seconds, furthering the feeling of being a complete dummy with the quick realization that you really do suck sometimes.Along the way you'll gain access to more troops to play as. Each one being its own humorous parody of a well-known character. Not only are they recognizable by many, but they also have their own individual weaponry and skills.If you're looking for a fast paced and enjoyable game, I cannot recommend Broforce enough. It simply is just gaming fun at the most barebones level, and I love it."

It is fast, furious, chaotic, violent, and absolutely brodiculous... Strangely enough, and I hope this feel expands as new levels and challenges are added, there is a puzzle game quality to the game as well since on repeated playthroughs your approach is very much defined by the specific bro you're using at any given moment. RoboBro? Charge up and destroy everything. Indiana Brones? While the reach of the whip is nice you have to be cautious and alternative routes by creating tunnels is a much more difficult prospect.The potential to add tons of new bros with more varied gameplay is massive, and user-created levels seem to allow for a lot of content to enjoy as time goes on. Certainly at this stage you'll play through everything and unlock all available bros in just a few hours but I can see this getting a lot of time on my dedicated MAME cabinet. Co-op is an exercise in frustration and comedy, completely dependent on who you happen to be playing with, but explosions everywhere can make it a good deal of fun.Out of all early access games I've gotten to this point this beats all others by a mile. Proud to be contributing to the project and hope to see more bros soon!"

Stir in the remaining sauce ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until sauce reaches desired thickness. Sauce may be refrigerated for up to 1 week.DoughDa dough itselfIn medium mixer bowl, combine 2 cups flour, yeast, and salt; mix well. Combine water and oil; heat to 120° to 130°F; add to flour mixture. Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. By hand, gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. (I used my KitchenAid dough hook attachment.) Knead on floured surface 3 to 5 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball, cover, and allow it to rest for 15 minutes.Divide dough into 2 parts. With well-floured or greased fingers, press each half into greased 12- or 14-inch pizza pan. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of your favorite shredded cheese over dough to prevent a soggy crust. Spread prepared pizza sauce on each pizza (approximately 3/4 cup of sauce per pizza). Add your favorite toppings---Typically everything american is the best choice Cover with shredded cheese of your choice- Mozzarella, Parmesan and Asiago. Bake at 400°F for 25 to 30 minutes until edge is crisp and light golden brown and cheeses are melted.

There is quite a bit of satire involved in the overall theme of the game, but it's not overwhelming or trying to shove a political opinion down your throat.  Mostly it's poking fun at the 80's and 90's action movie genre, while delivering some solid gameplay.The game has sort of a modern Contra-like difficulty to it.  You get one hit per life, and your Bro changes every time you die.  There are a few difficulty spikes, with certain bosses or some of the challenge levels, but the only real complaint you can make with the game is that it has bugs, and they aren't going anywhere.  Controllers sometimes freak out and have to be moved to a different port on your PC in order to start functioning again.  Also, some of the transition scenes like for bosses entering another stage of the fight can stick, and there isn't anything you can do but start the level over.  If you can deal with the bugs and you like a challenge, then this game is totally worth it."

The announcer does a fantastic job at giving this game the character it aims for. If you're looking to unwind, but in a fast-paced and totally awesome environment, Broforce is the game you're looking for. The developers put a TON of effort in paying attention to detail. Headshots, body part explosion physics, terrain physics, and much more. The controls are very crisp, and I find it fantastic that you can play with keyboard and xbox360 controller simultaneously. This game has a lot to offer in terms of asthetics, gameplay, and all out fun. Though I wouldn't consider this a 100% serious title (having puns and comedy thrown in), but if you look at it for what it truly is. It's gorgeous."

Maybe.Boring af alone and buggy af online.Bugs are: position bugs, delays, getting killed in the middle of a cinematic (although this might happen offline as well), not seeing what the boss is doing (litteraly had to kill a boss blinded because i could not see it but my buddy could), that kind of things. Those bugs can be deadly, example: you can get teleported outside of the room and being unable to complete the stage.Gameplay-wise, it's a fun game. Nice graphics and animation, fun most of the time. A few problems with the camera, not wanting/designed to frame too characters too far away (experienced this during a boss fight).I would like to recommend this game but giving the variety and frequency of bugs, I won't.tl;dr: could be a fun game but way too buggy to be actually fun."

Actually, the performance was better a year ago when I first bought the game, but either the game has become more taxing as its development has progressed, or (more likely) my laptop can no longer perform the way it used to (for myriad reasons).  Either way, the game is great, I look forward to its full release on PC (hopefully I can afford a real gaming rig by then) and PS4 (hopefully, but not likely with the Expendabros expansion).  In the meantime, I give this game my highest recommendation.  I love the destructible environments, the variety in weaponry among the bros, and the over the top voicework.  Enjoy!"

It's all good.The controls are crisp & responsive, the animation & design is charming, the playability is untapped - random placing of items assists, but playing the game is as compelling as breathing. But far more fun.Never do you feel cheated, neither does 'dying' result in punishment - just a loss of momentum at worst, but, more often than not, it rewards you with a 'Bro' that may be better skilled (or not) to re-try the area.The random selection of 'Bro's' is welcome and adds an interesting dynamic - choosing whether to swop a currently decent 'Bro' for a random rescue can make the player hesitate (sometimes fatally) or at least force a little wince.All in all, it just adds to the appeal, because whoever you play as, you kick♥♥♥♥♥  ..and i mean 'Kick♥♥♥♥♥♥ - Destructable ..erm, everything! to the point where 'Over Kill' can hinder you're progress.Mix this with the Physics, exploding barrels/oxi tanks, suicide bombers etc.. & you have an exploding-sploshy-chain-reacting-death-arena-of-fun.Being far from financially comfortable, i'm not one to flippantly recommend a purchase, but i do whole heartedly recommend 'BroForce' to anyone who wants a humourous, swift, cheeky little shooter. An interest in the subject matter is a bonus - the characters are superb & there has clearly been a lot of care & attention put into all aspects of this game.Beta: The game (at the time of writing) is in a Beta state. Buy it anyway..    ..seriously, it looks & plays better than plenty of 'finished' games currently available. Not once have i experienced a bug, glitch or anything adverse.Admittantly, I am kinda smitten with this game, partially because of nestalgia (it satisfies my retro sensibilities) & partially because it's genuinely sack loads of fun. Rarely does dying in games make me laugh, this title had me giggling like a school girl.When the initial 'Free Lives' hand clap logo appears & the music kicks in, it immediately makes me smile.It could be said that it's not difficult to complete (yet) but even so, I genuinely feel that it's more about the fun to be had whilst playing (even repeatedly) not so much the challenge, that once beaten, is rarely played again.If 'Super Crate Box' was a teenage speed freak, then 'BroForce' is his older, millitary trained, crackhead Bro..   ..and all his mates.And there's more to come..EDIT: The updates have been substancial, there has been dozens of new Bro's, several new levels, features and there's even Gigers Aliens (complete with working face huggers) and Predators running around.The party has got a whole lot wilder.What you waiting for Bro?"

The screen is shared between the two players (couldn't they make them SEPARATED?), there's a lot of particles and screenshaking and noise going on, you can't see what's going on half of the time. You have to control both people in the single player campaign too which makes things too messy for one person to understand. The characters aren't really that different when playing, they're either good or bad to play with, period.I can't see myself or anyone purchasing this for the full price. Get yourself a good 2D shooter like Enter the Gungeon or Nuclear Throne, not this garbage.+ Challenging and plays smoothly- Connection problems- Bland art and music- There's a free ""Expendabros"" crossover, grab it before trying this- Hire some decent programmers next time, okay?3/10"

Summarized concisely, it has tight controls, fast play(completing a tough level might take five minutes max), seizure-inducing particle effects, clever puns, satirizes Amurican war culture, and seems like a labor of love on the part of its developers.In my opinion, it isn't playing through the single player campaign that shows the finished game's potential, but the custom campaigns that players make.  What is important about the custom campaigns is that they show how difficult the game can become and often give a better idea of what the game's engine is like.  To give an example of the latter in case jargon is being used wrong, there are weird custom campaigns that could be described as hardcore platforming objective-based puzzles, where attacking is impossible for one reason or another. Hypothetically, even if all of Broforce's devs vanished off of the face of the planet, I could still fire-up steam and play new custom campaigns daily that are often really awesome and hard.The only things that really get me down when I play is that levels are seldom long enough for my taste and a few characters are *currently* too limited by their mechanics for my taste.This game is awesome.

,Not Recommended,274190,28929682,Posted: 1 January,all,Darkwell,"I can't really recommend this game. Although from screenshots and videos it looks like a rip-roaring good time, it's really just a messy cluster♥♥♥♥ of explosions and screenshake. You will frequently find yourself dead and asking, ""What?"", because you'll have been killed by something you couldn't see because of all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on your screen. Unseen enemies and explosives have a tendency to rain down from offscreen, which wouldn't be a problem in a game that encouraged caution, but Broforce wants you to charge into enemy's teeth, not wait for all the shooting to end and tip-toe to the next area. These problems alone don't damn it, but it's also critically lacking in one other area: killing isn't fun.In other stalwarts of the ""run right and shoot"" genre, such as the Metal Slug series, killing enemies is enjoyable. There's visceral impact with every action: your bullets fire and strike with solid feeling; knife attacks are meaty; boss kills are bombastic. Broforce offers none of that, just an endless series of bullets falling lifelessly onto an endless series of mobs. I can think of maybe two characters with attacks I enjoyed using, out of a roster of 35. Because of the lack of impact and meaninglessness of each individual shot, Broforce almost feels like a schmup, except it's without a good schmup's percision movement or high skillcap.On the writing side, the entire game has a single joke: the word bro. Expect to find it as a prefix, a suffix, or simply stuffed inside another word. It's marginally interesting to play as an assortment of poorly-disguised 80s action heroes, but after the twentieth variation of names like Rambro or MacBrover or Bro Dredd, etc, it's just tiring. Similarly, ironic use of shouting ""BRO!"" is amusing for a short time, but eventually it dawns on you that the game is no longer lampshading bro-culture, it's living it.Honestly, Broforce reminds me of a two minute sketch comedy routine that someone tried to stretch into a two hour movie. I'm sure you can think of a few of those. They've all been good, haven't they?TLDR: one long bro joke; messy, unsatisfying combat in a game that is only combat."

Yes, you heard me.  There are few games I can ever recommend at 100% of the pricetag, but Broforce hits every quota and then some.It's exactly as it sounds.  You go in, kill terrorists, 'get to the choppa,' kill bosses, liberate every single communist country within Vietnam, and do so while riding pigs and playing as 90's action heroes.  That says it all, it really does.Anyway, it runs on any crappy computer you might have, it's unique, the boss battles are fun, and it's got plenty of content to keep you playing for at least 12 hours.  With up to four local players, a crap-ton of characters to unlock, and both easy yet complex mechanics, it's a purchase you certainly won't regret, regardless of how much you pay.  At the end, you've still got VS modes, as well as full Workshop level integration with an in-game level editor, so lack of content certainly isn't a concern.This game's going to join FTL, Skyrim, and Rocket League as one of those games that EVERY Steam user will pick up at some point in time, just watch."

First note: I played this game on PS4 (due to free PS+ game), so don't let the steam play time fool you! However there are no differences between PS4 and PC version.I was really looking forward to this game! Nice pixel graphics, destructible environments AND one screen coop? Count me the ♥♥♥♥ in! Yeah!Unfortunately it is one of the games that goes like: Great concept, horrible execution. But first of all the good things:+ Graphics are indeed very nice! This is how you do pixel graphics right!+ Environments are (almost) completely destructable, which creates great chaos and mayhem+ Very funny announcer+ Huge charakter variety, with all different weapons and throwables+ Nice created world map+ Multiplayer (on- or offline!)There is fun to be had here! Absolutely! When the level blow up in absolut madness and chaos, when you moaw your way through hordes of enemies as their guts fly around, the game can be absolutely enjoyable!But after some playtime I realised the problems with this game, and they are not minor! I try to explain every negative point as well as I can, so you can (or maybe not) approve:- Non free choosable charakters: Everytime you start a level or free a bro (get an extra life) you are transformed into a random bro. Well I read that some people like this idea. I don't. Why? Because it sometimes does not work!What do you say? You are on one side of the map with 10 enemies on the other? Better don't get the flamethrower dude. Wups, dead.Some charakteres like Chuck Norris and Mister T are basically just made for close combat. So if you find yourself in a situation where you need a charakter with a long range weapon you are basically ♥♥♥♥ed! Nothing you can do about it. Why don't they just let you cycle free through the charakters (at least the ones you have captures within the level)? Before you say, that this would destroy the mission flow, No! Dying because you got the wrong charakter causes the mission flow to be destroyed. It just is completely nervwrecking if you managed to get passed that one tricky situation and die because you get the wrong charakter with only 1 life left!- Random damage system.Bros die one hit, you get one free life with every bro you have rescued. That is okay. But actually damage taken by f.e. explosions seem to be completely randomised. Sometimes you die, sometimes you don't! The problem is, that you can not predict anything and basically always have to stop before you shoot those barrels because you don't know if, or if not the explosion will kill you.- No up or down aiming. I am NOT speaking of 360° controlls here. I am speaking of the possibility to f.e. press ""up"" or ""down"" on the d-pad / keyboard to aim up or down. If you stand on or under a cage you can not simply fire it from beneath or above, you have to maneuver yourself next to it in order to shoot it. Even the old metal slugs had this ""feature"". Wtf? Sometimes those cages are at a cliffside, so instead of shooting it safely from above (WHILE YOUR ARE STANDING ON IT DAMNIT!), you have to carefully navigate yourself to its right side. This is plain stupid and a really missing feature!- HORRIBLE SENSITIVE JUMPCONTROLLS!This one is the biggest point of them all. Jump and Run is NOT fun! The floor seems to be buttered, because you always slide a bit. And the controlls are so sensitive, that the slightest and shortest press on that button will send you directly into your doom. If you have to be centimeter precise, the controlls just won't let you! Every Jump is a leap of faith. This is one of the most important and basic things in a 2D - Sidescroller. So why did they ♥♥♥♥ this up?- Sometimes not responding controlls:Yep that happened, I pressed a button and the charakter wouldn't act. After pressing the button again it worked. Absolutely satisfying in a game with one hit death!Like i said earlier: There is a lot of fun here, but  for me it is just not recommandable in its current state! Controlls need a HUGE makeover, and the balancing needs some work aswell.Everything is there for a great game! Visuals are great, the gameplay itself (if it is working) is satisfying, but that execution is just horrible.So If you like this review, let me know!If you don't like this review, let me know!But please be fair, I tried to be when writing this review aswell."

The concept is rich and the pixelated cartoony aesthetic is appropirately funny. But the game mechanic made this game, at least until I write this review, unplayable for me. Let me explain.First, the not-so-intuitive control. You can only shoot forward (right/left), not up or down. You can climb wall in the same manner as Megaman X did, but your shooting direction would be always to the wall, rather than against it (though this destroys the wall and creates new platform/enterance).Second, the randomly generated player. So, you play as this Rambo-esque guy, but in the middle of the stage you will find a prisoner in a cage, whom of course you would free. This gives you extra life, but also randomly CHANGES THE CHARACTER YOU ARE PLAYING, which completely changes your main and sub-weapon, forcing you to play the game differently. You previous character has a machine gun, now he only throw dynamites, and then you got a melee type character. This lottery mechanics doesn't make any sense gameplay-wise, because this hinders you from mastery and makes the game experience inconsitent.Third, the awkward speed of the game. For a game which gives you ludicrous amount of explosions, you would expect the game to be fast, full of shooting, throwing grenades, and jumping from platforms to platforms, like Metal Slug. But no, this game actually needs careful planning because one misstep and you would die. This takes away the delicious experience of careless shooting and blowing stuff up.Fourth, you die easily. You die by almost anything in the most unpredictable way. Your explosions don't harm you, but the enemies' and the environment's do. And there is no way to tell which is which. Sometimes there is a crowd of enemies and one of them is a demolition man who would run to you so fast and blow himself up. You get too close and kill him, you die too. And one of the character fighting style is melee. You do the math. Sometimes when you were busy fighting the enemy and blowing things up, you got hit by a falling rock. There are cues of danger, but you only have a very small window of chance. There is lilttle to no room for escape. Thers is nothing wrong with tough difficulty in a game, but this game is hard the wrong way. It keeps punishing the player for following their intuition.Maybe I just suck at this game, because apparently many people love it. But this game honestly doesn't met my expectations. I was hoping to play something that resembles Metal Slug in terms of intuitiveness and goofy experience, but I didn't. This game has done many things right, but the unintuitive mechanics and awkward difficulty, in my opinion, break the game.Try it before you buy."

,Not Recommended,274190,18886667,"Posted: 4 November, 2015",all,Mighty Shrub,"TL;DR: I love this game but it has horribly unbalanced characters, bosses that require specific characters to do well, ""difficulty"" that makes it stupid and ruins the fun, and certain things that can kill you through your 'spawn-in invincibility', which is either lazy programming or a terrible idea.I'd like the start off this review by saying most of the game is AWESOME. I really really love this game, or at least I would like to. See, this game suffers from two problems: horribly unbalanced characters/bosses, and a badly done ""difficulty"" increase. So, most characters are great, some are amazing, and I'd bet that each boss has one character that does really well against it. Then there are the other characters, the horribly ♥♥♥♥♥♥, nigh unusable characters that make you hate whatever RNG god had a beef with you on that run. Anyways, the game is supposed to be hard, but as it stands the harder levels are not harder in a fun way, they are harder in a way that you can be instantly killed by any one of the swarms of enemies that attack you, in a manner that just makes you want to stop playing. There's no dodging or smart plays involved, in the later levels you usually end up dying via cheap gimmicks. The last levels also feel unpolsihed, I've had static blocks of the bosses appear where they're supposed to spawn in later, parts of the background disappear, and just in general it feels less interesting than the original levels. The early-to-midgame bosses are made so that pretty much every class can beat them if you play it right. The late bosses are made so that certain characters deal insane amounts of damage and are literally the only way to win. The entire Satan boss fight is dumb, from start to finish. The way the level is desgined compared to how he plays makes it seem like it could be fun, but stupid mistakes related to how your character moves nad how he attacks end up with yet another restart. The second level of the Satan boss fight (and many other lategame bosses) involves him firing a wall of fireballs that are impassable and irritating to dodge. Then he summons giant fire snakes moving at high sped with little warning that can kill you regardless of whether you have that 'spawn invincibility' thing. You heard that right, there are things in the game that can bipass your only way to get back into the fight, with no ability to doge it because you jsut spawned in. Also, you have to get more lives by waiting for them to spawn in, but most of the time they just get killed by the boss' attacks and you end up dying and losing yet another life for trying. This is not how difficulty works, this is not how bosses work, this is not fun. I would actually love it if their next update brought in more maps and bosses like the original, because that was actually fun. The aliens and the hellscape were cool looking and intersting in theory, but instead were sometimes just painful to go through. So here's my lengthy thoughts, if anyone bothers to read it all. I really like this game and the kind of difficulty it starts out with, as well as the abiltiy to either play it really smart and tactical or just hold down the fire button the whole time. It's just got some bad features that break the entire experience for me, and did so every time I redid the campaign (I completed it every once in a while, and did a full playthrough on full realease, and now I'm stuck on the Satan fight in Hard mode, a mode which relaly has no effect on a lot of the gameplay, only giving the mooks slightly enhanced attacks)."

But I am sorry,this game is a buggy, unfinished software, and I willNOTsay it is good just because it has cool parodies and explosions.You might somehow be luckier than me and my friend, or you might want to play local multiplayer, in that case this game can be fine. But I specifically bought it after a recommendation for online mode, and for me AND my friend it didn't work.I have an optic fiber connection and the friend I try to play with has a good DSL. We chat through voice over IP at the same time but this usually works wonders in a lot of games, those for which the netcode is actually good.I play Broforce with him, and what happens? Just utter nonsense.We don't see the same things happening on our screens. Characters, both players and NPC, teleport all the time. I am dead but do not appear so on his screen. He walks through walls that appear intact to me but are destroyed for him... And also, everytime there is a cutscene, a super annoying bug happens where the game restarts after the cutscene for one player, but not the other who has no choice but have his character remain static and most likely die.What a shame. This game is full of good ideas.Until now we gave it some slack, saying ""it is early access, they will fix it, we believe"". We have tried coming back to this game several times and the problem was always here, but we decided to cope with it because we had hope for the future. In part because the game was easier and with less enemies, making lag more forgiving.Now the game is out of early access, and the issue is still here.The issue is even more problematic now that there are new harder levels with more ennemies : those levels are just an unplayable lagfest.You even have lag against the final boss, which should not happen as it is a single enemy. But my guess is that the guys who programmed this game have no idea what ""dead reckoning"" is, or can't implement it. (FYI it's a basic netcode technique).Developers, you now have removed the early access tag from your game, so there is no excuse anymore. This is supposed to be a complete working product. And it's not.Multiplayer, which is supposed to be the best thing about the game, does not work. maybe it does for soime other people, but for us both it didn't.I bought that game hoping to have fun with that friend which I can't often see in real life. Technically we did have a little fun, but I can't in all honesty recommend a game that caused this much frustrations because it does not work properly.Maybe get this game if you can play multiplayer local.

It is a decent game, but far from better than other indie games out there. It is only fun for like 2 hours and then it all gets pretty boring and repetitive. The enemies are the same and the levels is too similar to each other.And the fact that you get 1-hit in a game where it literally explodes everywhere at any second is a very bad game design decision. It forces you to play careful and slow instead of having fun and blasting everything to pieces like it wants you to do. Hotline maimi style doesn't work everywhere you know.4/10"

Over-the-top explosions, destructible environments, and proper responsive controller support had me from the get-go.Unfortunely, multiplayer is a complete mess visually, and I really didn't enjoy that much, even in local co-op, which I usually love.On release, the devs really pumped up the polish on the game as a whole, but I feel like they lost focus in maintaining the tone.  For me, the game went from being a wholehearted nod to the classic action movies and ended up being more crass than entertaining.My declining love for the game reached bottom in the final ""interactive"" cutscene in which you have two options: a) urinate on the headstone of the fallen final boss or b) ALT-F4 the game.

Lots of bugs and terrible net code make it really difficult to play with friends without someone dropping out or desynchronizing during a session.Game crashed and completely wiped my progress, causing me to lose all of the bros I had earned since early access. The menu is also just plain bad - overly sensitive, no confirmation prompts when potentially ending games, no options menu access from within the game while playing, and generally just poorly designed so that it's difficult to see anything above or below what's currently selected.I expected better after leaving early access. Rather than polish what was already there, they dumped more content into the game without fixing most of the existing bugs, and seemingly added even more. Read other negative reviews to see what people have been running into. They've all been needlessly downvoted as unhelpful by fanboys, but buyers should know what they could be getting when buying this game.I'd be asking for a refund if I didn't enjoy the game otherwise.

,Not Recommended,274190,18826208,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,Predo,"So there you have it: Famous action heroes from (mostly) the eighties and early nineties mixed together in a 2D Sidescroller, taking out faceless evil henchmen-dudes.Having grown up with most of those pinnacles of their genre, i'm conflicted: Can i recommend that game?And answering that question, im conflicted.Lets start with the ""Bros"": On this part, the game can convince at least most of the time. ""Brommando"" and the ""Brominator"" are a must-have, the same applies to most of the other heroes. But the set-up is not without questions: Off course you have to put Rambro and almost every movie-character played by Schwarzenegger or van Damme into this kind of game, but why the hell have you taken the ""Rocketeer"" into the selection of heroes?Or that girl with the machine-gun-leg from ""Planet Terror"" ? Or those Brothers from the ""Boondock Saints"" ?Why no role played by Charlos BROnson (Pun intented). Moreover, who considers the ""Men in Black"" or ""Leon - the professional"" as action heroes? Or McGyver (has he ever killed anybody in the series? I cant remember such a thing).Anyway, those points are nitpicking; the set-up and the hero-selection can convice most of the time.Also, the 007 has a nice twist: Its avatar-pic is taken randomly and can resemble every actor who played that spy.The game mechanics, on the other hand, are not that thought-out.The melee-characters are almost ridiculously underpowered; while ""Blade"" and ""Neo"" can compensate this to a certain levelwith speed, Mel Gibson's ""Broheart"" and the ""Bride"" from ""Kill Bill"" are stopping when attacking, giving you a hart time taking out large groups of enemies.The leveldesign  on the other hand  is solid most of the time; while large parts of the terrain can be destroyed with explosives you're almost never forced to restart the level because you blew up too much terrain thus blocking the advance.Moreover, there are a lot of ""rogue-like"" Elements in it: e.g. you slide explosive barrels into large groups of enemies, who then are freaking out and starting blowing up stuff, creating sweet chain-reactions of death.So why the red thump?Well, i for one thought that ""Broforce"" is a skiller like ""Hotline Miami"" in a 2D sidescroller. But where Hotline Miami relies on your skills and minimizes the element of luck (well; at least in ""Hotline Miami 1""), ""Broforce"" is the antipode of those design idea.The game enables you to play in the ""ironbro""-mode; that means, if a Bro dies, you've lost him for the rest of the campaign. Are you running out of rescued Bros, you've lost.That Mode shows all the design flaws mentioned above. Since you can't choose your Bro, you can find yourself in the situation fighting a Chopper with a melee-character (good luck with that).Another unspectacular ending is getting killed by an enemy off-screen.Or you are forced to play with ""Cherry Browning"", the chick from planet terror. Due to her Machine-gun-leg she can only fire downward, not sideways (yeah, have fun cleaning out those the heavy-armed-bruisers in tunnels).Every bro can take only one hit, so youre burning through your set-up rather quickly. And you cant compensate that (like in Hotline Miami) with planning ahead, because you could blow up a barrel (accidently) off screen and the chain reaction is killing you. Then again, you're playing Rambro; does he look like he is planning in advance?Death in HM was part of the gameplay. You restarted the levels by hitting the r-key; milliseconds later you could start the carnage again. and again. and again.In Broforce, when running out of lives, you need to wait until the ""gameover""-screen is fading out and the game has kicked you back to the mission-selectmenu (again, in Ironman-Mode).So, in conclusion: If you love blowing stuff up with ridiculously muscled ""Bro""s and Girls, ""Broforce"" is the right game for you, best played in your lunch-break or on short terms."

Let's look at Contra again, the levels are very open and sprawling and enemies are all over the place instead of lined up in cramped hallways.By far the worst part in this game is that the environments are destructable in whole--grenades, bullets, etc. will destroy chunks of the level and you have to navigate around it. This is SO frustrating when a grenade destroys part of a platform that would have made it easier to navigate the level. Why was this necessary? It takes the focus off killing enemies and makes it so you have to watch out for crumbling rocks above you or bottomless pits you or an enemy accidentally create.Another problem I'm running into is the soldiers have no reliable AI when to shoot. They just stand there for a second before shooting but they give no indication. Your best bet is to just kill everything as fast as possible and don't give them a chance to shoot. But then you go too fast and you get killed by an explosion you didn't see. Half the enemies have dynamite attached to them to where if you hit them they explode and will kill you in their vicinity, how big this explosion AoE is is never clearly indicated in-game so you better just run the ♥♥♥♥ away.This game tries to be some fast-paced Contra clone, but between the explosions everywhere, the enemies melding into the backgrounds, constantly switching characters needlessly, random paths that lead nowhere, and the levels breaking apart, this game is anything but. You usually have to  approach large groups of enemies from afar instead of being part of the action lest you blow up an explosive drum by mistake.I don't care how many angry Steam babies inevitably thumbs down me, you know I'm right about all these things. This game is sloppy and doesn't deserve its rave reviews. Broforce should be compared to better run and gun shooters before it so it can see why it will fade into obscurity in two or three years while games like Contra are timeless."

Whenever I try to join a game a friends make, I can't join. After I type in the password and hit enter nothing happens. I cant join any games at all and whenever I host a game all my friends can't join. Also, this game does not explain any of the keyboard controls.

Well, because, i was expecting a CONTRA like or a Metal Slug like and not just a speed score game without funny tricks, without story/objective, but with f***ing explosion everywhere, every time you shoot something.This last argument could be cool (Mickeal Bay funfact like) if, explosion were not so uncontrollable/chaotic.Sometimes you die and.... you don't know why...Honnestly, the mouvement panoply is really weak ! You can only shoot horizontaly, jump and use a ""special not so special"" depending of which Bro you're playing.You win Bro's but you can't choose wich one you played.Other disapointing thing : the range of your weapons and the challenge of your enemy.The Foe are shooting with a long range of 20 pixels when 90% of Bro are limited to 10 pixels max....But in counterpart, Foe's are shooting ""Once for a while"" when you can shoot 500 bullet during the same period...Conclusions :Ok, this game is ""work in progress"" but, I don't see how some awful defect can Involve.Maps are small and dramaticaly identical/boring.You didn't have any trick or inventory to tranform Broforce in Terraria + Contra + M.Bay mashupThe game is really really short (didn't see a lot of people with more than 8hours ont this game...) and I am tempted to say ""is short like his concept""  :  Make you buy a game just because of the Bro-LOL........Be strong, just watch the Trailer, smile/apreciate/laugh but DON'T BUY this game/joke !!!"

This results in players constantly getting out of screen bounds, falling and dying. Too often i can't distinguish my character due to insane amount of explosions, fire, bullets and other particles being on screen. The camera also constantly shakes which makes it even worse and sometimes just pans to random parts of the screen for not reason. Basically playing this game involves a lot of random tries and death's, and barely any skill, safe for fighting some bosses.It also doesn't really support controller - there is no rumble, controls are over sensitive and switching in menus is just awful. Quite often my character kept jumping, rolling or walking forward by himself with me barely touching the controller.There are also connection issues.To summarize - right now this game is just too chaotic for me to have any fun. I get that this is exactly the point why everyone seems to be enjoying it but its just not my cup of tea. I like destructible environments, i like explosions, i respect Contra and movie heroes references but i hate that camera too much to recommend it anyway.Let the dislikes rain down on this review like Murica rains bombs in the Middle East!"

It can get every bit as messy as the videos imply. The entire game is, to me, about nonsensical gratuitous death and explosions. Like Excel Saga, or (to a certain degree) Kill la Kill, this team is 100% dedicated to producing its idea, no matter what, and have created something that your brain acknowledges is completely silly. The lack of a need to take this game seriously only makes it so much more fun to revel in the carnage and destruction.There are no gritty backstories, no grey areas, no moral choices or judgments. This isn't a work of literature, just blow stuff up and enjoy it!For what content is there, you can repeat it over and over, and the current number of heroes will make it a different experience every time.

76561198031619075,Recommended,274190,10409012,"Posted: 9 June, 2014",all,Perpendacular!,"Broforce is a classic example of a game that knows how to not take itself serious in the slightest, and still be playable and fun. The game, in short, is just constant chaos. It's very hard to feel as if most of your deaths are justified or avoidable, and most of the time, you don't at all feel remotely in control. If you are the type of player who really, really can't stand dying unexpectedly or spastic difficulty, then you might not like Broforce as much. If you enjoy dying randomly in a blaze of glory only to restart as a totally different character and plan, then I highly suggest you pick up some of the most refined, well done, and straight up hilarious mayhem ever to be crystalized into a video game.The game is relatively simple. Each level is a run from left to right over a field of volatile explosives, suicide bombers, dogs, robots, bosses, rockets launchers, and machine guns, which is sprinted by a plethora of classically exaggerated badasses from various action films. Ash, Indiana Jones, Neo, Rambo, the Terminator, Conan, they're all just a sample of this game's hilariously testosterone-saturated character line-up, all with some clever ""bro"" pun name, and each with their own special primary and secondary attacks. You will be rapidly alternating between bros, as each one dies from just an errant single shot, being to close to an explosive, falling down a bit, being ganked by angry dogs, or just generally being in the wrong place at the wrong time. You only get one hit, and you will die constantly. Yet dying is still hilarious fun.Of course, being blown in gibs is only a riot the first few hundred times, and I will say that certain bosses become more frustrating than funny pretty quick (namely the airship boss of the city level). The game's fluctuations in difficulty can be pretty annoying at times. The game is also ultimately pretty shallow, so if you're looking for a lot of customization or diverging paths or methodical character building, you're not going to find it in Broforce. It's also not a game of skill, remember that. This is not like Megaman Zero or Metal Slug and certainly not like Contra, the game ultimately boils down to sprinting right and shooting at anything that moves, while frantically jumping out of the way of possible threats, but almost always a tad too late. Remember, you will die a lot, and you will die unexpectedly and without control. You can run fowards guns blazing two times and get totally different results. The game is not a test of gaming finesse, and if you treat it so you will be disappointed. The game is only about the fun of rapidly changing characters through absolutely ridiculous carnage. And it does a damn good job at that.So, I highly recommend this game, especially considering how early in development it is. It's currently a fairly short game, but is getting more and more added onto it, and it has a level editor supplying plenty of community created maps. The game is fun in its most purest form, just watching the world around you get completely destoryed. If you sitll have any bit of a destructive child left in you, with game will satisfy you fully. These devs deserve the support, and you deserve the game."

Each time you meet with your demise, you get to play as a different 80's action movie star. Each Bro has different and specific power-ups.The game play is fun and fast-paced, requiring the KBO (keyboard operator) to take it slow when needed to plan what to do. You don't necessarily need to shoot everything because there is always a stealthy way to take something, even though it might involve an explosion or two.Broforce is a great game that you will return to play a lot if you like your shooter action arcade-style and 16-bit.

Regardless, I think a cool idea to implement into the arcade version of the main campaign is the continue system similar to how Metal Slug operates (seeing as there's obvious inspiration here).  Extra continues could be rewarded if you manage to free all the prisioners in the level which ramps up the challenge factor (or something like that.  It'll make the arcade option look more like an arcade game should, rather than a casual action game mode that doesn't provide large enough stakes in play, such as losing all your progress  and having to start from Mission One again.I haven't had a chance to try multiplayer, but from what I've seen on videos, it's looks like so much more fun, and chaotic, especially with 4 players.Is it worth $15?  That would depend on who you are; yes the full game will be available to you in the future but for now it's maybe 70% of the way there (maybe less) so as of right now there's not a lot to play around with (single player wise).  I, personally am content with the price tag seeing as I enjoy the process of being a part of the developement of game and being able to play bits and pieces as it gets built.  I enjoy the interativity of it...So you be the judge whether or not you'd rather wait for the completed game or jump right into itI look forward to the complete release..."

There are multiple characters that you can unlock and theyre all based on action movie heroes (theres rambo, mcgyver, blade, the dude from die hard, dredd, etc.) This game is great for something fast to play alone or just a random fun game to co-op with friends. Kind of repetative after a while but when they add some of the planned features it will get better. right now i'd give it an 8.5 or 9 out of 10 for an early access indie game. Buy it! :D"

,Recommended,274190,9957395,"Posted: 27 April, 2014",all,Mr. Strider,"I don't normally recommend Early Release titles. Ususally, they're a relatively incomplete experience, or at least not worth the price of entry. And while I won't call Broforce a complete title by any means, it certainly seems to be well on its way, far better than many of its early release brethren. It is a simplistic, yet surprisingly interesting 2D shooter that can be equal parts blind run-n'-gun or clever pseudo-stealth platformer (don't let that title fool you though, there's still plenty of bloodshed.) You assume the role of numerous non-copyrighted action movie bros as you seek to liberate the world of evil. With guns, bombs, lasers, and anything else within arm's reach. But, that's enough summary, here's the key information.First, some caveats. The only (for practical purposes) complete portion is the solo campaign. But, that can seem misleading. There are other facets, custom maps, test maps (if you're one to delve into such content), a fair amount of community maps, and even the new (at the time of reviewing) campaign map work better than the touted features of some ""officially released"" titles. However, there are issues. The networking, in particular, can be nightmarish. In my testing instances, my buddy and I requently lagged out, before eventually disconnecting, despite being quite literally 6 ft. away from each other. If you want co-op, I highly recommend doing it locally, on the same system. Using one player on a gamepad and one on the keyboard can work, or two gamepads, et cetera, whatever's comfortable.Now, the stuff that works. And, there's actually a surprising amount of it. As mentioned earlier, most of the single-player content's pretty playable. As for control, both keyboard & mouse and gamepads are supported (I used a wired Xbox 360 Controller to test gamepad fuctionality), and both are workable. Some may prefer a gamepad, but once you get the hang of the controls, keyboard and mouse can be just as precise and enjoyable. Lastly, the characters/updates. There's a pretty large cast of characters considering this game's in beta, and even more are slated for release. From the simple Rambro to the ""aghluaghla"" -spouting Bronan, it's pretty interesting watching these various heroes tearing through terrorists. One minor dent, however, is the random nature you get these bros. Outside of the one time you initially unlock them, the bro you play as is always randomly selected. This can lead to difficulty, as some of the bros are simply either more useful in certain areas, or more useful as a whole. Being able to select a pre-set squad of five-or-so bros to always cycle through in a stage, or even the option to play as one bro only, would be nice, at least in single-player games.To finally wrap this thing up, the real question: should you buy beta Broforce? As much as a cop out as it may sound: it's really a matter of personal taste. If you're a thrifty shopper, or only have a passing interest in run-n'-gun/retro-simplistic style games (think Hotline Miami), you may want to wait until this game goes on sale, likely at the time of full release. But, if you've seen the gameplay, seen the trailers, and like what this game is going for, then supporting the devs and getting your hands on this title early may make a bro of you yet."

,Recommended,274190,10928200,"Posted: 28 June, 2014",all,DaneJa,"You play as a variety of Hollywood action heroes like Rambo, Judge Dredd, Bruce Willis ala Die Hard, Arnold, Wesley Snipes' Blade, Will Smith's Jay, MacGyver, etc. and just generally deliver American branded freedom in large explosive quantities to places like Vietnam. Each character has a main attack, an ability/grenade, and a melee attack. Every character plays differently and as far as I can tell it's random which character you play as. It has destructible terrain, wall jumping/clinging, and the controls feel pretty tight allowing for some pretty fast paced action if that's the way you want to play it (you should). As you go through the levels you free other action heroes from bondage which act as 1ups, so when you die you then play as that character. At the end of each level you kill what appears to be Satan and ride away on a helicopter as everything blows to pieces behind you. It would appear the game supports up to 4 players on the same screen, but I haven't tried that out yet.  It also appears to have some kind of online multiplayer stuff, but I haven't looked into that yet, either.If that's not enough to make you want the game, I don't know what else to tell you.  It's pretty awesome."

As it stands the game is fun, challenging and humours.  Gameplay wise it's an overthe top version of Contra which starts of easy but gradually ramps up the difficulty.  What's great about this approach is you start off feeling like an indestructible badass (naturally) but as the game progresses and tanks and helicopters start appearing you have to start thinking about how to use the destructible enviroment to your advantage.  And speaking of destruction it functions in much the same way as the difficulty.  Yes you can destroy everything on the map and yes it's awesome but if you're not careful you'll wind up crushed by falling debris or blown up by enviromental hazards such as propane tanks. I've played through all of the currently available levels and unlocked each of the currently available bros.  Speaking of the bros, excellent design on each that forces you to adapt your playstyle to the strengths of the character that you are controlling.  These are not mere pallete swaps but instead each character had different abilities which can help (or hinder) your progress through the map.  Since recruiting new characters throughout the level is your only source of lives you're encourage to play each and every one of the bros.  Not going to give any names away but there were LOTS of pleasant suprises in the roster.  For $15 with included Multiplayer and a map editor this game's a bargain."

Of course this comes with the caveat that it is in early access, but it's incredibly playable and fun as is. The main campaign can be blazed through solo fairly quickly, but there is more of it to come as with the games ever growing selection of characters and modes people who enjoy the formula will find that Broforce just keeps on giving.Some players may find the game a little simple at first, but the later stages become elaborate combat puzzles as you work out how to handle the enemies with what you have at the time. Broforce pits you against staggering odds just like the Bros (and lady-Bros) to whom it pays tribute.So ultimate the question is, are you a bad enough dude to fight the good fight?If so, get Broforce!Seriously though, it's damn awesome!"

It includes a level editor and multiplayer, but at the time of writing this review they are in alpha. There is at least 3-4 hours of game play in single player alone. They plan on adding more levels as they make more of the game.The game is on early access so if you don't like supporting the devs befor they have a final product you might want to hold off. What is compleet is fun, but it needs more levels and steam workshop support would be an amazing addition.All in all its worth the money in its current state even if its not completed, I have bought AAA games that were not as fun, so drop the 15$ you wont regret it."

If you can find another game where you can play as Rambo, the Terminator, Ash Williams, Neo, and The McManus brothers I'd be impressed. I will say that the game is amazing but to fully enjoy it I think you need a controller. I played about 56 hours using the keyboard but when I switched to a controller it not only got more fluid but also felt a little more natural for this game. So far the devs have been very good and involve their player base in what they're doing. Based on that and what they have in the works the price tag is well justified despite being short right now(there is custom levels that add to it as well so there's still more to play).Easily a 8.5-9/10 now and I see no reason for it to not be 10/10 by the time its done."

I can only foresee you not loving Broforce if you don't like 2D platformer shooters (i.e. Metal Slug, Contra), but you cannot deny that it is lovingly crafted. It is by far the most polished early access game I've seen on Steam.Every character is enjoyably unique, offering some clever reference to the movie that s/he is pulled from. Enemies are fodder for your arsenal of weapons. But you have to take into account that you also die in one hit. It's well-balanced and only really agonizingly difficult when you're playing difficult custom-made.Yes, there is a level editor. It's not very user-friendly (admitted so by those at Free Lives), but it offers new levels every day by creative (and not so creative) fans.And the four-player co-op and competitive game types are hilariously fun.

It is constantly being worked on. The destructability of the maps really changes each run and gives you different options. They have nearly every badass from action films/shows. With the fast pace and constant dying you will do, you might not notice the nuances and potential of each bro. Each bro feels entirely unique and mastering each one is difficult. My only fault with the game is that you don't have a list of bros that you can checkmark to only use the bros you prefer. While I understand their decision to make the player selection random, it makes it neigh impossible to ever master a bro. Unfortunately you will often come back to life as your favorite bro only to die and be disappointed. Besides that, the game is damn near what it looks like. Explosions, Weapons, Killing henchmen (and the ocassional boss), and all the bros of legend. I'd recommend it."

Hotline Miami 2, another devolver masterpiece, is currently my favorite game, but this is a close second. This game has all of my favorite movie characters, with awesome level design and  over the top effects, slaughtering random♥♥♥♥♥terrorists. The gameplay is great and the evnironnment destruction is perfect. My only complaint is the imbalance of the abilities of some of the characters. Some characters are definately more fun to play than others, for instance Mr. Anderson with his ability to fly and crash into enemies, but dont feel overpowered. Some characters however, such as Brobocop and Bro Dredd, have abilities that you have to control manually. (Homing bullets and a homing missle respectively) This slows down the combat, doesn't feel tactical, and leaves the character vulnerable while they use thier ability. An auto lock system would make these characters way easier to play. I would also enjoy a second gamemode where you choose a single character to play as. Perhaps even multiplayer pvp would be fun too. Overall however this game is just fun and testosterone. Ive had to shave twice a day since I got this game."

Every character has their own special characteristics that make certain parts of the game easier or harder, and if you are a fan of oldskool Contra and its many clones this is sort of like Contra on crack -- imagine playing contra w. a level editor, and the ability to destroy the level as you play.The last boss was incredibly great, too. Gave the game that perfect epic quality in the battle while simultaneously just making me laugh.In addition, the developers were very responsive when I brought it to their attention that there was a bug.

The game is very fast paced, meaning that it will be hard for people to lose interest on what's going on2. The bros available are references to famous characters, which most players will instanlty recognize. This allows for the player to understand how probably the bro will work and it will aslo make the player feel good about using a character they know3. The pixelated touch makes the game feel more of an acrade game, which is what Broforce is. This arcade feel makes the game more cartoony, so the player can take the game as a game for fun instead of a game to go extreme tryhard4. The objective of the game is very simple, meaning that it will be esay to catch on, but challenging enough that the game doesn't become stale.5. The stereotype of the US being the best country in the world is shown all over the place. So for those who like this joke, you'll enjoy this game (#'MURICA)To conclude, Broforce is a game both worth your time and your money."

Broforce is not easy if you are accustomed for slow paced games, Every bro drops dead after one shot, but levels are fast to get finished. So even if you get stucked in some place, stuck is not long enough to get you out of pace. The humour is simple and repetitive but in this case it is goal, not flaw. If you are interested in bood paved path to victory and freedom accompanied by sky high flames and massive explosions, Broforce is definetly worth a shot."

It features AWESOME run and gun action with plenty of different bros to play as. The dev team have added new terrorists, aliens and now undead enemies to battle throughout your conquest of the land of Broforce. One very useful part of the game is that you can sit down and play a couple of levels for 5 minutes or complete several zones over a longer period of time, this makes the game flexible and fun to play at any time. Finaly, Broforce is an awesome game full of fast paced action that makes you come back wanting more.10/10 would reccomend."

You can play almost as any action hero ever existed and beat terrorists aliens and satan.All levels are well designed and interesting.My only complaints is - not all Bros are fun and well designed - there is few Bros that underpowered or with bad special abilities or just with weird mechanic too complicated for this type of game to survive madness of combat. And since every time you get random bro your chances to complete the level or beat the boss can be reduced to zero due to randomness of characters. But levels are usually short and can be complete in less than 2 minutes with checkpoints on bosses so even if you'll get screwed by randomness it's not a big deal.

I mean, what super patriotic American doesnt like a game where you get to play as such American heros as Brobo Cop, Bronan the Brobarian, or Bro Heart. Sure some of the specifics might be iffy and the game might be hard, but each Bro you unlock is incredibly unique and true to the hero they are based on. And even if you end up playing as a bro who only uses blades you can still take on the hardest enemies (though not always successfully). This is a game that truly works to make you have fun while also experiencing what seems to be hell.As the game is now out of Early Access the main additions have been the very short list of achievements and addition of Hard Mode. The achievements are, for the most part, true achievements, as they are a way to show off something incredible that has been done. Beating the campaign, while a simple task, was never easy to begin with, but they added the ability to go through it on Hard Mode (an even harder task) and an achievement for winning without a single death. To beat the campaign you need exceptional luck, luck only bestowed when R. N. Jesus blesses you by giving you a lifetime supply of 4 leaf clovers. Beating the campaign on Hard Mode is the same, but with an extra helping of skill. Beating it without a single death is only possible when you steal the luck of everyone in all of history (only the good luck of course) as well as the skill of everyone who has ever played the game. This gives the greatest challenge they possibly could give (unless you compare it to the challenge of not getting hit in a bullet hell game).Over all, Broforce is a game meant to challenge you, your luck, your skill, and your patience more than anything else, and we need this in a game."

If I exited the game, when I came back I had to replay the previous level, so in order to be able to continue from a specific level you must finish it first. After finishing the game, I cannot load any level anymore and have to play the game from the beginning.- Like a previous reviewer said, load times are usually fast but can sometimes spike to a minute or even more."

Needless to say the pixalated carnage of Broforce, as well as the parody of the whole game took me back. The premise of the game is very simple: a side scrolling game that requires you to make it from point A to Point B while slaying the terrorist scum in between. The game offers a great variety of characters that employ everything from fists, to machine guns, to katanas, and all the way to rocket launchers.Graphically, the game will take anyone back to the side scrolling era of pixel graphics. Its not meant to look beautiful as the whole game is one big homage to Duke Nuke'em in my opinion while parodying the plethora of action movies offered in the last 30+ years. The controls can be a little tedious at first, but ultimately fall into the ""easy to learn, tough to master"" realm. The gameplay itself was great for 20 minutes here, 30 minutes there while the campaign could probably be knocked out in around 6-12 hours depending on your skills. The custom campaign levels created by your other fellow bros leave hours of endless carnage ahead."

It would be nice if the game joining bit was a bit more user friendly and perhaps the choice of Bro you want to start with.I toss these things full force forward because it's ome of the only few things that really comes off as a design flaw. Everything else you can blow, blast, and strangely really stratagise around, and the likilyhood that even after the game is truly finished, there will likily be fan made missions for years to come. Even as an Early Access and the game letting you know when you finish what it has so far, it already feels like a polished experience.Unlocking all of the hollywood knock offs is fun and a new experience every time, so many hilarious trappings per acter and finding even the least likily to be useful Bro's weapon load out will surprise you. Not sure if you'll like it? Try out Expendabros, a demo that is it's own free game. That one only has local co op, but still great, and then realize BroForce has all the more fun and online co op.All that and throw in every other jungle, aliens, and action flick situation that ever mattered in the 80's to 90's in something so straigt forward, yet surprisingly smart in how to take your mission, and so easy to grasp, and it's simply a must have experience for anyone who even remotely enjoys the likes.And again, all this, and it's not even finished making more levels, characters, and when it does finish all this, it still won't hit the cieling as so many others are expected to add to it. It may not have levelable characters or customizable guns, but the mass amount of different things you get, you won't care, and it's probably a good go too answer if your Mercinary Kings experience feels like it fell a little short of expectations."

I look forward to seeing how this game goes as it gets closer to being fully completed.""Following up on my original review, I want to say that this game is still quite good; but it is not as good as it was when I first purchased it. Many of the Contra-style gameplay elements remain and are quite enjoyable, but I believe the game suffers from a serious lack of balancing. Many of the playable characters are simply poor performers compared to others, and recent expansions in levels render some characters totally unplayable for much of the game. There are also a number of levels that suffer from poor design, in particular a number of boss fights where unique elements or challenges have been poorly implemented.Overall I'd say this game is worth picking up on sale if you're into this style of game and enjoy the satirical aspects, but it is definitely far from finished."

From Arnold Schwarzenegger to Neo to Robocop to Rambo to Will Smith, oh ya and CHUCK MUFU*KIN NORRIS. Think of any bad as* character and chances are he/she are in this game. Oh and If they're not I bet they will be soon because updates to the game that add new characters, levels and generally improve the game, are being made constantly. Hell, today i opened the game and found 4 new charaters waiting for me. Also this game is extremly replay-able and does not get repetitive, I've beaten the game at least 8 times already and I'm still going back for more! Hard to believe a game that is still in beta can be this fu*king great! It is a SIN to not get this masterpace of a game! I've reccomended it to two of my friends already and they love it just as much as me! If you think I might be exagerating I'm not Broforce is just that good and it's easily my favorite game! I just wish I could tell you the million other reasons why Brofoce is the best game ever but that would take to long so ya I'll cut it off here. -Austin W (Aka Broforce's #1 fan)"

The graphics in the game, even though pixalated, do astonish. I also like the destructible blocks and destroyable bodies.But the game is to hard for my computer. The games like explosive run and levels of higher dificulty (level 6 and up) lag horibly on my pc. If possible it would be better to reduce frame rate."

The uses of well known characters being portrayed perfectly is ingenius, with each character being unique in many ways it means you can easily have favourites for different situations (when i'm swarmed I like macbrover because of intense vermin cleaning turbo turkey speacial power) so the point is the team could continue working on this forever. They will never catch up with the current list of possible heroes and with new action films coming out all the time there is a self sustainable amount of heroes, like Katniss who is fairly new to the movie scene.I personally like this as an idea, after the current aliens arc (storyline, missions whatever you call it) that they could make an entirely new one perhaps based on super heroes. A quick superhero idea would be a rather obvious option: Superman (perhaps he is generally faster, hovers instead of walking and jumps high, flying ould be too op). Superman's normal attack could be shockwave inducing faster than light punch, his special could be laser eye oriented and his mele could be an upercut that launchs enimies up which if follwed by jump-down + melee is a smash combo that causes enviroment and enemy damage as the initial enimies body is splattered. Just a brief idea.And though this is kinda long I promise you it is the short version as I could speak a tiresome amount of hours about how this game including all the tiny things that rock (crouching on an enemy has a teabag like effect and so much more)Edit: I hope part of this big reveal to be is that satan is slowly forcing the aliens under his rule hence thi big one at the end with rockets.Speaking of Satan nothing this game gives me a greater pleasure than throwing him off of the edge to his doom."

,Recommended,274190,20024786,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,CrispyPie,"Broforce is an epic, and chaotic, game. I'm going to break this review down into specific sections.Gameplay 9/10- The gameplay is REALLY fun. But there's one mission type that I plain hate. It's the Covert Operations. You have to finish the entire level on 1 life,and they usually have the most annoying enemies. Robots, Brutes, jerkish grunts who tell said annoying enemies you're there and dogs. Usually bunched together in 1 room. With explosive barrels. There's also no checkpoints. So while the game is fun, the covert operations, I could really do without. There's also multiplayer mode, online and offline where you could play with up to 4 players for maximum destruction and chaos.Sound 7/10- I can't really remember any music tracks. Just sounds of explosions, manly grunts, and screaming.Story n/a- From what I know, there is no story. Just a bunch of bros liberating areas and stopping terrorism, But that doesn't really bother me.Visuals 9/10- Broforce has this really good looking pixel art style, but at time, things can get a little out of hand, your         eyes may get lost in the craziness and you might die by a stray enemy bullet, or an explosive barrel you didn't see. That can get a little frustratingContent- 8/10- By the time of writting this, I played for 3 hous, and I'm a little more than 50% done.  So 15 dollars is a little steep. Maybe wait for a sale.Overall 9/10- Broforce is a very fun game. There's a lot of action, the ""bros"" you can play as all referance some 80's or 90's action movie, and it's addictive. It can be a little frustrating, especially when the screen gets full of exsplosions. I say pick up te game for a good time."

You play as overpowered action heroes, each with their own method of attack, special ability and occationally a variation on a  meelee attack. You feel like these action heroes because of the way that you attack and you feel , well, powerful. Yet I never once felt overpowered or that the game was too easy (granted, I played on hard mode) and it is that that makes the game so good. You always feel powerful but never once too powerful. When you combine this with the upbeat tone, the tight controls, a perfectly campy plot, multiplayer, surprisingly good platforming and a massive freedom to approach every level in different ways you start to see that this game really is well made.**Sidenote**Whenever you pick up an extra life it changes what character (or ""Bro"") you play as. Many find this annoying because is doesn't let them always play who they want to play. However, I find that is a good system because it forces you to weigh up if that life is worth it. It can also provide a ""Reroll"" of sorts if you spawn as a terrible character."

If he stayed up though it than I know it has to be just as good as I thought it was. I highly recommend playing with someone however it's not necessary. Hell I'll play it with you. The music was strong. It kept me pumping through the levels even when I was so tired I wanted to call it a night. The voice acting was loud.  Like it hurt my throat just listening to that voice actor. Not that it was bad. The game play was phenomenal I felt the action and when I used a weapon you saw just what it did. I was still unlocking things in the final levels. There's no holding your hand. This game can be rough in some spots.

,Recommended,274190,22854512,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,Chief_Judge_Fargo,"Bro-force is without a doubt one of the best indie titles i've played so far,The game features a wide cast of characters, which all serve as tributes to some of film and TV's greatest heroes. With this wide cast, comes a wide variety of weapons such as machine guns, shotguns, flamethrowers, high powered rifles and miniguns. Each character has their own special move. which corresponds somewhat to their character, e.g Bro Dredd has access to guided high expolosive rounds and Bro Hard gets stun grenades. Co-Op allows for 4 players to blitz through 1 level at a time, causing ludicrous amounts of chaos in their wake and is by all means great fun.The game features fully destructable environments, and the game encourages you to use this to your advantage. Don't want to fight that rocket truck? No prob bob, just tunnel under the ♥♥♥♥er by blasting away at the ground. A few levels require you to make use of the environmental hazards at your disposal, in order to defeat certain bosses.As for the enemies, first you'll be fighting standard ground troops, including 8ft tall guys with chainguns. Next come the vehicles, then come the aliens and after that you start fighting the spawn of hell itself.The game can be quite difficult at times, with the game even encouraging you to play Normal mode first before playing on Hard mode. The boss battles later in the game can be quite a struggle, but ulitmately satisfiying in the end. You may find yourself starting certain levels over more often than you think and some require a small amount of problem solving, mostly around using the destructable environment to your advantage.I was able to complete the story mode on normal in about 9 hours, so by no means is this a short game. Hopefully co-op along with the higher difficulty levels will provide me with some extra replayability, along with the custom campaigns and level editor, which I've actually yet to use.Oh and you get to♥♥♥♥♥♥on satan's grave.Broforce is a decent game that will probably hold up for a fair few years. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel/expansion to this game as I would love some more unlockable characters to play as.  I can wholeheatedly recommend getting this game, even more so if its on sale."

It's a nice change of pace from other games. Story is minimal if at all present which reminds me of classic games where the highlights were boss battles. Gameplay is quick and the character you play as is randomized from a selection of unlocked action heros. I haven't really found myself frustrated though with constant failure in this, because you spawn as a random hero I find it changes up the gameplay always offering you a chance to do something differently. I think fans of action movies will absolutely love this game."

It is set in the design of an '80s action movie/series with a ton of ""bros"", or playable characters each with their own unique abilities and advantages. For instance, the first bro you get, Rambro, has a powerful semi-auto rifle with his special attack being grenades. I won't name anymore to avoid spoilers and have the joy and getting that next bro, but I have personally enjoyed every character thus far.The gameplay is fast-paced and high octane shooting. All the terrian is destructible but be careful and not just hold down your fire button because you might accidentally blow yourself up with explosive barrels. The game offers a challenge at normal difficulty and increases significantly at harder levels (which makes it even better bro!). The learning curve is not difficult and you can jump right in and get the hang of the game really easily. The only hard part is adjusting yourself to each bro but it only takes a few moments. Even though this game is still technically in alpha, it has at least 4 hours of game time for the world campaign and much more outside that. You will definitely get your money's worth for this game I highly recommend this game and I think it should be in even one's Steam library along with Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon which is also amazing.Now:321GOOOOOOOOOOO......"

My real Bro and I live really far apart and coop games gives us a great way to stay in touch.  If you have friends you can play with or even a Bro of your own I highly recommend picking this gem up.  The controls are easy to pick up and they feel smooth most of the time.  From start to finish there is non-stop action!  Explosions, screams, mayhem, and madness accompany nearly every moment and the shear amount of stuff going on at any given time make this a fanatasic twitch action platformer.  The levels develop nicely and the dificulty ramps up quite dramatically at times.  The new character unlocks are always amazing and give you another reason to keep pushing on.Throughout my time in the campaign I only ever encountered one glitch which caused a boss to become unbeatable until we died and restarted the level.  My experiences only cover the coop campaign including the newest alien content (also totally amazing!), so I can't speak to how stable the deathmatch content is.  But the wifi connection was fine and my Bro and I had a smooth experince even with skype voice chat taking up some bandwidth too.  Ultimately my biggest complaint is with Indiana Jones's character who is somewhat useless as he can only kill with his knife or bombs!If you've looked at this and thought ""maybe it'll be worth but I just don't know..."" I can honestly tell you that it is worth it!  Even for an early access game there is a good amount of content and it runs smoothly.  The developers have put together a good product and gotten many of the basics down solidly.  There is a ton of potential for growth and I can't wait for more content."

If you'd like to see a playthrough of the campaign from the newest update see below. If that doesn't convince you of it's awesomeness, keep reading.BroForce is basically about a group of thinly-veiled parodies of various action movie stars/characters with Bro substituted somewhere in their name fight masked terrorists (?) called Mooks in Vietnam because 'Merica. While there is basically no story, it doesn't really matter because the gameplay is quite fun.It's a shooter in the vein of Metal Slug and similar games where you're running left to right and shooting/blowing up various things, from Mooks to giant armored tanks. There are a few different game modes and this is the general idea throuhout. While you can only shoot left or right (apart from one Bro who shoots down) the enemies do the same so you're not at a huge disadvantage. On hit will kill you but if you save a Bro in a cage you switch Bros and gain a life (this is also how different Bros are unlocked, each with a certain number of rescues to the next unlock). One thing this has going for it however is that nearly all terrain is destructable. You can literally flank a Mook by shooting a tunnel underneath him and emerging behind him. It's also not unheard of to accidently (or not so accidently) set off massive chain reactions of explosions as parts of the ground get obliterated and send exploding bits of things onto other things that would very much like to also explode, seeing as how all their friends are doing it.Each Bro also has a unique special move that has a limited number of uses. They range from grenades, slowing time to even Broniversal Soldier's ability to ressurect dead Mook and Bros to help him. These are almost always helpful to get out of tight spots of get rid of particularly troublesome Mooks.I also have to mention the campaign map. You fly a helicopter to different areas and unlock more by beating an area. The best part? You can hit the seagulls with the helicopter. Good times. At least for us (the seagulls not so much).All that being said there are some issues:-The white area of text (shown in their videos) on the campaign map that list the area and say LIBERATE! is a lightish black, making it hard to read. I don't know if it's every version or just Mac specific.-Not all Bros are suited to every suitation and the only way to switch is by dying/saving another Bro. Saving a Bro is random which one you'll get, except when doing so results in an unlock.-This isn't so much an issue as something to be aware of but it is possible to destroy enough scenery to make advancing impossible without dying to reset the level. Devs, maybe put undestroyable scenery at the bottom everywhere EXCEPT where you want bottomless pits?-Expendabros is PC only (I need more BroForce awesomeness!)The issues are pretty minor and there's enough content here it could be released now and still be one of the best Steam games but Free Lives is taking their time to make this a finely-polished explosion extravaganza. With a lot of early acces games it's hard to reccomend getting it until it's finished but BroForce has enough polish, content and (most importantly) fun packed in it that I can easily reccomend anyone toget it.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=294700212"

The gameplay is solid and a nice balance of instant death but never feels frustrating. Little things like the character shouting ""yeh!"" when he gets a flag or the subtle change of death animaitons for 007 as he shoots enemies is what really makes the game. My friend and I couldn't stop laughing as we kept discoving new subtle parts to the game. The characters are great but a few need a little work. chuck noris always feels bad to unlock because he shoots nades but his special is ...more nades? Kinda hard to get through a level with just him. Others like Ripley are REALLY weak against anything other than generic soldiers though her flame thrower is boss.Deathmatch is fun but needs some balance. When my friend got the character that has slowmo (forgot who) the game is basically over. You can't react in time. Only once did I manage to get off a shotgun shell off into his face with ""Bromax"". Deathmatch isn't the main game mode though so it's not a huge concern.All in all I love the game and I can see the love. I can't wait to play more."

That's how this game goes.It does not bother to bog you down with a half-baked story and instead gets straight into action.That being said, it's a very enjoyable game and a very classically styled 2-D platformer. Campaign mode is not much of a campaign due to lack of a story line, and it takes maybe an hour or more to get through it. This should not sway your decision of purchasing the game. I found that there's already a good amount of user-created content being made, and it comes with level editor and online campaign play along with some other interesting modes. Keep in mind that the game is not finished and most of these modes are still in alpha, so these additional features aren't nearly as polished as they will be when the full game releases.From my current experience playing it and being a such a fan of this genre of gaming, I highly anticipate playing the game in its entirety when it's farther along in development."

The game idea is addictive, fun and simple, and I think that this could eventually become a really great arcade style game.  So far I love it, and I've gotten my money's worth out of an alpha edition with no plot and only user made levels... The characters are cheesy caricatures of action heroes, each with their own weapon and grenade type, the environments are destructible, and most of the levels are puzzles... It is a really fun game even with the glitches and limited content.  If you want a retro style arcade side scrolling shooter with over the top explosions and cleverly hidden puzzles, then keep this game on your radar... It could actually become a hit!!  It's telling that this game only has a couple of negative reviews, and 1/2 of those are fake ones telling the reader how awesome it is!   In contrast there are dozens of positive reviews.   I would say that this is an incomplete package, but it is by far the most fun I have ever had with an alpha build...  I am looking forward to the actual campaign for this game, and I can't wait until they fix a few bugs, but until then I can see myself playing this game at least once a week just for the instant gratification that I get from playing some random online level.  It's worth 15 bucks in fun right now, and when its finished this game will suck at least 25-30 hours in entertainment from your life... Plus there are good opportunities for replayability since anyone can design a level and upload it.  I recommend this game in its finished form, and if you are bored I recommend it right this moment... It is best with a controller."

Gameplay is fast and frantic, with destructable environments that will do you in just as quickly as they'll take out your enemies, if you're not careful.But the best part is unlocking the various characters, all of whom are based on classic 80's action movie heroes - Snake Plissken, various incarnations of Ahnold, even Ripley (although she's technically not a 'Bro' - a 'Bra' perhaps?), all with individual attacks and specials.Even though this game is still in Early Access, you'd never know it.

Rescue captured hostages to unlock special characters (I've seen ""Boondock Bros."", a crocodile dundee, a rambo, a matrix agent smith, a terminator, a robocop (brobocop?!), a bruce willis die hard (barefoot lol) and a bunch of others).You are randomly assigned one of the available characters every round, each 'bro' has different weaponry/abilities, and each round is quick enough that the variety and randomness make it all so much fun to play.If you're playing multiplayer, rescuing a hostage will randomly assign control of the rescued hostage to one of the dead co-op players.

Basically its a arcade platform shooter with fully destructable terrain.I have been a bro and supported broforce since the brototype (I think you can still download that, I'm not sure). I have played broforce since its very first release and have watched as new bros (Anderbro and Bronan) came out. Now its even more awesome with more bros, levels and game types. As you save the bros in cages they give you an extra point/save. Once you save enough bros you unlock the next bro thats more powerful than the last.The game is completely pixallated. This is one of the games appeals giving it that lovable, retro look. (see my profile picture).The gameplay is completely insane at times where you have called down 15 air strike missiles that are blowing up skyscrapers with you and the enemies inside while blasting them with a shotgun (I call him chuck norris).With everything happening at once and the different bros enemies you'd think that the game would be difficult but its really not. You run around shooting guys and avoiding getting hit yourself.For an early access game, get it. its definately worth buying it, beating it, then knowing that more updates are to come.Pros:- Graphics- Gameplay- Future updates- Tons of different bros- Online- Different game modes- Controller support (I cant find my controller)- Up to 4 player co-op- Campaign- Unlockables- Different enemies with different attacks- Bosses- Level based game- Turkey Bombs- Mooks are funny- Propane and gas tanks- Fully distructable terrain- Great movement (backflips etc.)- Easy to play- Simple concept- Updated all the time- Finish by shooting the devil- Explode your friends by dropping a helicoptor on them- Race your buddies to the top of a tower while its exploding underneath you.Cons:- Costs money"

There's no strategizing or planning. There's exactly 0 tactical depth. There's absolutely no reason to be emotionally attatched to the characters you play as or interact with. The soundtrack won't make you weep at how beautiful it is. You can't even pick your character, and every time you get or lose a life, you get given a random character.Therearea lot of explosions and extremely fast-paced slaughter and destruction that are just a, well,blast. All of the Bros have something interesting (except Indiana Brones) that makes them fun to rescue and play as for however long that lasts before a stray bullet instantly kills them... which is okay, since there's another interesting Bro to come out and play as. It's crazy, it's exciting, it's just plain fun. Best part? Local co-op! Get your bros and a couple of controllers and 'splode together!Only problem?

That means you get 2 lives, twice the firepower, and their special ability is to summon another one of them (or a replacement if one of them dies)Snake Broskin: Probably one of my top 3 favorites. A long-range sniper rifle, that can go through 3 objects at once, and his special ability is a MOLOTOV. woooBrobocop: A robotic character with a gun that charges up to fire more than 10 shots at once, and the special ability to TARGET certain enemies from a distance with bullets that seek out the enemies.Oh, and theres explosions, too. Lots of them."

,Recommended,274190,14747969,"Posted: 5 March, 2015",all,S.M.G.,"I could not recomment this game enough.  This is a side scrolling shooter that is difficult, enjoyable, and funny.  While it is good multiplayer, this game truly shines playing it with your friends and talking trash about how each of you die in hilarious ways.  This is the most fun I've had in awhile playing with friends."
76561198031101935,Recommended,274190,14715048,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,o0oINFINITYo0o,"This game is non-stop action, delivering gorgeous pixel art with a big budget action movie atmosphere. Each BRO is unique in terms of abilities and gameplay. While it may seem repetitive, the game offers so much destructibility and awesomeness that one quickly forgets about the repitition of each level, and focuses on how to create the most chaos when destroying the various enemies. For those looking for a challenge look no further. A mix between Super Time Force and Super Meat Boy this game provides quite the challenge, as 1 bullet from the enemie instantly kills that BRO. Strategy becomes a major important element, as rescuing your fellow BROS gives you more chances to complete the level.Broforce has so much potential to become one of the BEST indie-games in 2015. With so many action heroes and stars featured in movies and television adding more BROS would provide even more fun and variety. Expansions and themes such as the ""Alien"" levels add enemie variety and more fun to an already enjoyable game!Characters from Halo, Metal Gear Solid, Gears of War, More Super Heroes, etc would make great additions imo."

,Recommended,274190,14698420,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,Deathcon,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWIt takes alot for a side-scrolling, early access game to impress me. But Bro-Force took the cake on this one. The gameplay is smooth, exciting, fast-paced and filled with gore. It can be challenging at times and you may curse alot which is totally cool. Multiplayer is fun as well, making the additions of race modes on top of the usual deathmatch and co-op you'd expect. Definately worth the buy even in its early stages of development.8/10"

Hours of blasting, shooting fun with your friends. More guns, rockets and missiles than you can shake a stick at. Amazing characters borrowed from pop culture such as the Brominator.Hilarious over the top violence. Completely reccommended."

If that doesn't make you want to just throw money at the screen then I don't know what will. Honestly, I don't know why you're still reading, if you are considering buying this enough to read reviews you probably have 15 $, now go spend it on broforce. From the huge number of playable characters to the amazing mechanics, frequent updates, awesome art style, cool music, and action movie AMAZING broforce is easily in my top 10 games of all time (this does not just include steam, but all my prior gaming experience on consoles and handhelds (ds, dsi, 3ds)) also, steam if you see this, add a OHMYGODBUYTHISGAMENOW option for whether or not you recommend the game, just for broforce."
