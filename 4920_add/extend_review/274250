Timing-based scoring system (Perfect! Sick! Sloppy! Sketchy!) makes for a solid ""perfectionist"" type of challenge, yet one not exactly punishing at early levels. Animations are pretty choppy and the character art (while often charming, such as the bails) is unrefined and downright ugly at times. Kickflips and heelflips for example, are visually indistinguishable, and for a 2D game, good sprite work and animation seems like a pretty important thing. Doesn't really have that skateboarding ""feel,"" but a solid game nonetheless."

,Recommended,274250,11388210,"Posted: 24 July, 2014",all,Facewizard,"Absolutely excellent little game.One of the most common things you'll read about it elsewhere on the internet is that it'sreally hard.This is true-- but OlliOlli's difficulty is fair, fun, and rewarding. Landing tricks is legitimately difficult and feels great. After a few play sessions, you should really start to feel yourself improving.The controls are extremely simple-- left analog stick to line up a trick, 'A' button to push against the ground or land the end of a trick combo. Tricks are controlled by the directions you push the left analog stick. Releasing the stick causes your character to jump in the air and attempt the trick. Sweeping the stick around in a circle will line up a more complicated trick, based on the distance and direction you sweeped it. The only way to get credit for a trick or a combo is to tap the 'A'button quickly just before you hit the ground. The closer to the ground, the better multiplier you get.Overall, the system is simple and rewards practice. Chaining together a long combo is quite difficult, and you'll have to chain some pretty ridiculous ones to complete all the objectives in each campaign level.Speaking of levels-- the ""Career"" campaign has several ""acts"" with eight tracks each-- four easy, four hard. Each act has its own art style. There's also a ""Spots"" mode, where you get to execute precisely one combo before the level ends. Extending that combo gets you more points and a better spot on the leaderboards. The final game mode is the ""Daily Grind."" It provides a single randomly-generated track that you only get one chance to set a score on. So far, the Daily Grind I've tried has been quite hard.I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys twitchy, timing-based platformers or arcadey, combo-centric skill games. Not for the weak of heart, but ultimately accessible to anyone with a gamepad and the will to improve.It's also worth mentioning that the soundtrack is excellent."
,Recommended,274250,16279320,"Posted: 9 June, 2015",all,bobert awful (F+),"I find the prospect of having to ride on a board with wheels under it a very, very terrifying experience. There are many ways I can fall off that board, and I imagine all of them have to do with something like falling onto a turd or a water hydrant or onto a set of figurines that are participating in a heated battle of Warhammer 40,000 on the sidewalk, where I will pierce one of my internal organs on a Tyranid and have to explain to God when I get to the pearly gates why I am such an ultra-wuss.OlliOlli captures some of that terror because it has a difficulty curve that's steep as hell, like learning how to ride an actual skateboard. The tutorial could have been better (for some reason I couldn't actually figure out how to do Perfect Grinds until I just said '♥♥♥♥ this' and played an actual level, where I slowly figured it out on my own, but I think that's more of my blatant inattentiveness than the tutorial's fault), but the real learning experience is pretty much about getting better and faster at the game, and learning how to squeeze in more tricks between grinds for higher scores or for unlocking bigger, better levels. If you want to unlock those ""Pro"" levels, you gotta ♥♥♥♥ing earn your keep. Once you get in the groove of actually starting to pull off sweet moves and getting in the habit of varying what moves you pull off, the game opens up dramatically and challenges you even more.Despite OlliOlli's semi-'thrown in the deep end' type of tutorial, it gets its vibe right. The soundtrack is the perfect thing to grind to, and the controls are a bit finicky but the way they are built allows for effortless cool stunts between jumps. It looks cool and I bet you will not be called a nerd if you show people how you can do a 1080 Backside Flip-It to people on the bus without losing. It's Super Meat Boy hard - you will break your knees and ankles so many times before you can finally pull off that grind-flip-grind-twist-grind-perfect landing combo, and it will feel glorious. If you can beat all the Rad levels, I bet you can show someone at the interview for your next job and you will get that job.Personally (oh no! Personally, the verboten word in video game reviews), I'm not a fan of these endless hardcore trek-up-Death-Mountain challenges, and OlliOlli didn't change my mind. But I like what it's doing enough to recommend it."

If you like challenging games that get you try and re-try until perfection, this is it. The tricks are easy to start, but developing skill is an entirely different thing. This is a game where you're going to have to practice and become skilled at what you're doing, which is something I understood the moment I completed the tutorial and tried the first level. It's satisfying when you finally do what you wanted to do or clear the goal you've been trying to clear for the past several minutes. I definitely recommend a game pad with this, as it brings that EA Skate stick control to the game and you can get a better feel for doing the tricks. The music is fantastic. It's a nice blend of mellow Hip Hop (sampled or synth) and it helps take the edge off when playing.If you like skateboarding, you'll like this. If you like challenge, you'll like this. If a rage quit is something you're fond of, you'll like this game.My only hope is the developer considers adding character customization to the game."

,Recommended,274250,11620622,"Posted: 9 August, 2014",all,I Stay Puft,"OlliOlli is a 2d skateboarding game that bares similarities to the gameplay of now defunct developer Black Box skateboarding game ""Skate"". The basic control scheme is all there, you have your left analog stick quarter circles, full circles and point analog at said direction to pull off a variety of combo skateboarding tricks and grinds. Sure it doesn't have any of the crazy stunts of a Tony Hawk like 720 shove it-to -superman-heelflip-whatever but pulling off chain combo in OlliOlli has just the degree of difficult and requires just the amount of skill that pulling them off will give players an equal amount of gratification when done properly. Players progress in challenge latened levels where either collecting, pulling off x amount of combos, or reaching a certain amount of score will progress you to the next level and ultimately to more difficult challenges.When it comes to presentation OlliOlli 2d pixelated art style helps sets it apart from the more well known 3D skateboarding franchises by giving the game a indie feel very reminiscent of underground skateboarding back in the day. This feeling is reinforced by the music that not only helps set the tone but remind players the variety and diversity skateboarding is. There's a level of cool brought to this game simply by choosing these aesthetics.A few issues I had with this game was primarily on the mechanics side where the initial timing for the landing of tricks require players to press a button at the right time to pull it off perfectly. This window to press the button is fairly short and requires you to pay attention to how far your board is to the ground. This can prove an issue because like other 2d endless runners before it if you aren't paying attention to the screen correctly your character may blend into the background which can prove troublesome.  Failing to pull off the perfect landing on a trick can be the difference between getting 100k score on a perfectly run level to 20k score on a poorly runned one.Overall if you ever had an interest in skateboarding games or were interested in this game when it initally came out on Playstation Vita but didn't have the hardware to play it, I think this is a game worth picking up."

It's a mix between endless runners like CANABALT, Super Meat boy and the Tony Hawk franchise. The look is a bit uninspired, with very basic visuals but everything is in some way neatly color-coded so you'll know where to grind and where to jump. The soundtrack ranges between smooth bar jazz and dubstep with drops as big as the one in level 5-5.The 10,99€ Price tag seems steep and could be under 10, but i can't complain. i played more then 13 hours and come back now and then for more, just because it's a fun, easy and fast way to kill time and to pull of some cool looking combos.Get it! if not now, then on sale."

The Music is godlike, graphics are pretty good, and the flow of game doesn't try to push itself too fast. The big problem I have with this game is the button layout and the button input with this game. I range from all skateboard games from the First Tony Hawk, to Grind Session (bonus points if you know what that game is) to Skate, so I can get accustomed with any button layout; however, I feel that this button layout is too minimum. Using the A button to both speed up and land properly is kinda odd. There were many times I would land with the A button, only to hold it for a few seconds because of the odditiy of it. Making the land button another button would not be more beneficial for they player. Another problem is the timing, the timing seems too precise at times. There were many times where I though I was ok for a grind (because my guy had enough air and could clearly land on it in enough time) but only to fall short cause I was a millisecond or two off. With that being said is the time for landing. My most anger from this game actually came from when I thought I was in OK range to land a trick, only to get a sloppy and me swearing saying ""I had plenty of time to land it"" or something along the line. They joystick for grinding and doing tricks is perfectly fine, I liked it in Skate and I like it here.Overall the game gets a thumbs up for the Music, Animation and it is still a fun game to play casually.

Being a big fan of 'simple-to-play-difficult-to-master' types of games, OlliOlli looked to be right up my alley. After trying many many times to control the character with keyboard or gamepad, I just couldn't get the hang of it. There are two things holding me back: 1) Viewing or anticipating what's coming next, 2) Timing.Yes this is a timing game but if I can't see what's coming next I cannot anticipate when to jump. The game forces you to memorize and replay, rather than stick to reflexes and hand/eye control. I wish the camera was zoomed out 10-20%. Also the controls are pretty brutal when it comes to succesfully landing a grind, rotation, or landing. I wish it was just a tad more forgiving as crash landing a 10 trick run is mostly due to missing it by a nanosecond. For some this is just right, for me it's too harsh."

The basic premise is that it's a runner game similar to Bit.Trip runner except you have a wide variety of tricks you can pull off the ground and a variety of grinds you can pull off on rails you find on the stage.The game has a strong focus on timing as you gain maximum speed by pressing a button just as you land on the ground or on a rail for a perfect landing and harder stages have huge gaps after a series of rails that require you to perfect land on one, off it and perfect land onto another.The trick/grind system can also be compared to moves in ARPGs like DMC. There is a wide variety of them and in order to build up a good score, you have to use a variety of each throughout the stage.In order to unlock stages, you just have to beat the previous, but there are optional objectives in each one that you can shoot for for 100% completion. Usually there's 1 for achieving at least a certain high score for the whole stage, 1 for achieving at least a certain high score for a combo, and the other 3 involve a variety of objects like collecting hard to reach collectibles in the stage, reaching high places in the stage which requires a set of perfect grinds, pulling off a certain move or a combination of trick/grind, restrictions like not pushing for more speed on ground, no grinding, etc. They're all fun to get.When you've beaten the initial 25 stages which will take you a hell of a long time especially starting out, there are 25 additional harder stages. After that, there is rad mode where you have to beat all 50 stages with only perfect landings, and while you can get used to it, some stages are incredibly brutal because some gaps seem only passable if you slow down and not perfect land to hit a closer platform before a huge gap.There is a lot to do in this small, high skill ceiling game, and if you like runner games like Bit.Trip runner, I would reccomend this♥♥♥♥♥♥with the force of a thousand suns.

The controls in this game are so stupidly done it almost seems as if they made a bet with the staff to see who could create the most counter-intuitive operations possible for a fast-paced action/sports game. Last Devolver game I buy. After Hotline Miami I said the same thing and I honestly didnt even see that this was Devolver when I bought it on sale. When I saw the logo pop up when I started the game I said ""&$#@, cant believe I missed that"".Since they wanted to rely so heavily on the analog sticks (which I totally approve) they shouldve never made a requirement of using ""A"" to land every single trick. Since ""A"" is also used to pump for speed it should only be used for transitioning between rails...if even that. Setting up for tricks and activating them didnt need to be dependant on 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, etc rotations and then releasing when using the D-pad is much more precise and you can get a longer trick list if you incorporate the diagonals as a defined direction.Thyeve made blasting out tricks between grinds unecessarily difficult...even on the first levels. The tutorial will tell you to grind everything because that wil give you more speed. Except for when it doesnt and it stops you dead, causes you to fall, and you have to restart your run. Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumbAnyway, trick execution is abnormally stupid. And I know how this happens. One person came up with the control scheme. It felt natural to them and they implemented it (this is someone who was just mediocre at the original Tony Hawk games and was mad that their friends were able to score higher than them). The rest of the staff thought that since the game itself wouldnt really be challenging or fun, they could just roll with the control scheme being counter-intuitive and that would suffice for a game that was well thought out. Using ""A"" to land is so wildly stupid that I cant even fathom how that stayed in for the final version. First of all, landing your tricks in real life is totally dependant on your prior execution. They couldve easily done one of two things to incorprate a skill/timing based landing function. Either use ""down"" on the analog stick or make your landing dependant on your execution. Too little speed and you may land wobbly, too much and you may not be able to set up for the next execution. Their levels are laid out perfectly for the latter.Its amazing how well Devolver is getting at taking something that is different, fresh, and has tons of potential and just smashing it into pieces and then taking a hot steaming dump right on top of it. Thank god I only paid $6 for this. Uninstalled!If anyone is hell bent on getting this game please respond here first and I'll put up even more reasons why you should save your money. I think I accidentally encouraged one friend to get it so now I have to buy them a game to replace this piece of crap1/10 - Because music isnt bad and the idea WAS great."

Too many levels feature insta-death obstacles almost right at the start of the stage, which is as much fun as being thrown three live grenades and being asked to judge which one weighs the least.As the game goes on, more and more levels become reliant on grinding your whole way through, which quickly becomes tiresome and very same-y. Said same levels often REQUIRE that you're playing perfectly, otherwise you will move too slow and not be able to make a gap. The second level of the last world requires dozens of perfect grinds. If you fail almost any of them, you have to restart.I'm assuming, in part, that the reason why there is so much grinding is because you are unable to Manual between tricks, If the game was more flatland/street scape then the opportunities for combos would be greatly lessened. But you know what else stops your combo meter? Lamely falling into a gigantic pit full of ♥♥♥♥ing spikes. Nothing de-hypes you quite like pulling off fiften perfect grinds in a row to look like a chump because you only landed the Salad Grind on top of the neon dinosaur, but you didn't land it ""Perfect"", so now you're dead.What I desperately want in this game is a level where I can♥♥♥♥♥♥around and practice without flying into hells ♥♥♥♥ing teeth every twenty seconds.

If you're into other skating games (Tony Hawk) or side-scrolling platformers, then this may be a game for you.The controls, while a bit counter-intuitive at first, become second nature quickly, and they are tight and snappy, as any good fast-paced platformer should have. Very rarely does a death feel like the game's fault, and this is one of the core strengths of the game.As well, the level design seems well-planned and intelligent, forcing players into situations where they have to adapt using only the small control set they have. It just feels, I dunno, smart.There's a lot of replay value to this game, too. Besides the Daily Grind (a daily course, as the name suggests), there are many optional objectives throughout single-player.The music, above all, is to be recommended. Not only is all of it good, or at least listenable, it seems to fit the vibe of the game very well, contributing to the overall feel.Visual style is very minimalistic, which is sort of good in a game like this: everything stands out distinctly, grind rails are obviously not obstacles, stuff like that. It also keeps a relatively clean, neutral palette, and this is soothing to the eyes, at least for me.Overall, if I had to put it on a 10 scale, I'd go 8. I'd like to see more games like this in the future. Play it, if you haven't already."

There's way less emphasis on ollying and grinding seems to be the key feature, this is pretty much all you do in the later levels. The camera angle is way too high, it's hard to see what's below you 80% of the time. You're going at high speed, you ollie and then you roll the dice whether it's something you can grind on or if it's something you need to press A to land. This is especially annoying when you're chaining together a combo and the game screws you over.One thing that bothers me the most is that it feels kinda clunky, it might be something you have to get used to, but it throws me off every time. Every trick you do your feet have to be on your board first. Heelflip >land on board >land trick, laserflip >land on board >land trick etc. The speed that you go added with the pixel art also doesn't help as it's hard to tell if you're on the board and/or if you're close to the ground.It's also got good things going for it. Chaining together combos perfectly is really satisfying, when you screw up you can press select to instantly restart giving it a ""just one more go"" kinda feel. There are quite a few tricks too, the tutorial doesn't do a great job of explaining some of it but you can do a lot of crazy stuff. I also like that you got to ""press A"" to land your moves, while it can be frustrating it's also to the games benefit as it feels really good when you land something complicated perfectly.Overall I recommend it, but buy it knowing that there are a few issues that need to be fixed."

I'll pretty much play any skateboarding game since the EA skate games aren't on PC (thanks EA) but I was pleasantly surprised by how great the controls of Olli Olli are. The tricks feel very similar to their real life counterparts. For example, kickflips in real life are a flick off of your backside front of the nose, and in olli olli it's a flick to the right on the analog stick (which would be your backside if you ride goofy).That and the variety of tricks are what keep me coming back. The courses are fun, but if feels a lot less like skating in the later levels. The first world is still my favorite.The one possible con I've had so far is in the quality of the port.

I've played it around 10h now and it was definitly worth all the money. I can recommend it strongly to anyone who is either interested in skill-games, skating and/or has played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater back in the days. Something about the feel is very similar.+ Great overall feeling (with controller)+ The spot and level design is very dynamic, multi-faceted and balanced. You never feel treated unfair, even though you suck 1000000 times at the same♥♥♥♥♥♥+ Sound effects are perfectly suited to the game dynamics+ I sometimes feels like I can just close my eyes and play the slides through by sound.+ The atmosphere totally soaks one in. Time and space fade into each other so there is only OlliOlli left in the universe.+ Lots of motivation behind the daily grinds.- Sometimes (when triggering fast) the controller sensivity doesn't react properly to the landings and I fail the tricks (mostly at the same spots over and over again). Is it only my controller?- Somehow I still don't 100% get how to achieve these extreme highscores. When I do a lot of combinations there is no significant difference in points (sometimes even worse) to when I just use whatever flips and slides to go through the level.

At the time of writing, I am stuck on the level set before the final level set of the five level sets of the base game. And I thought OilliOilli was gonna be short. There are the 25 base levels, the 25 pro versions of those levels, then the can’t touch the ground versions of the base levels then the pro versions of those. OilliOilli isn’t a game I will finish anytime soon, I tried. I tried to get all the individal challeges on every individual level but mt fingers said, “Nah Bra”, and went numb from masterb……., Pain.I wish I could play OilliOilli all day but it hurts to play if for long periods of time, it’s like Guitar Hero all over again.Plot:The story of a man-boy with no face who is indebt to Comcast and must skateboard for Mountain Dew Commcials in increasely dangerous areas all to badass music.- JKGameplay:The gameplay is easy to learn but hard to master like a broom or sex. The gameplay consists of your character permanently moving right from the start of the level into jumps, tricks, and grinds. The skill theat comes into play is the timing aspect. You have to time every landing and grind with corresponding butten pressing or stick flick right before you hit the ground or rail. This not only affects your overall score but your speed which might umped you from finishing the level.Controls:If you watched the review( watch it I’ll wait ), I went on and on about the controls. They are fin but I wish there was a switch for to not have trick stick and for the LB button on the 360 controller not to hunt my left index finger.Graphics:Their Pixel, There Awesome, That’s it.Sound:Stop Google OilliOilli Soundtrack too late I did it for you. I usually don’t care for music in my video games. I mute it and forget about it. This game remimds me of when I first heard the music in Tony Hawk Pro Skater, being a Black person only exposed to rap music it opened my eyes to other genres of music. OilliOilli did it again. Also, the sound effects sound good too.Final Thoughts:As i said in the Video Review, OilliOilli is a solid game for five dollars but at it’s current price, kinda of a hard sell. I recommend this game if you are one of the five people with a PS Vita. My PC people wait for a sell, if you just need it now, you won’t be disappointed as was I."

Those guys totally sold me on the game within a few seconds of them playing it.So, the game, as stated before, is fantastic. That is helped by a few amazing key features. One of them being the really simple to learn, takes forever to master tricks. They're all a ton of fun to try and pull off, and you could spend hours just learning how to pull one of perfectly in a ton of different ways. Another one is that the game actually has some legs. Given that you can play the game all the way through in a couple of hours is deceptive, because once you nail five stars in a stage, it opens up a second tier stage for you to play on that takes more skill to pass. And then there's a whole other set of stages and game modes to play after that, that is just a blast to play. The soundtrack is a ton of fun, and as is usual with Devolver Digital games, as soon as you fail, it's a simple press of a button and you're right back at the start of the stage. No long loading screens or even a moment to wait, just right back into the game.On the negative side, it would be nicer to have a few different modes to play, especially in a multiplayer sense, maybe actually playing with other people on a stage at once, maybe throw in a way that you could trip up the other people in the stage while you're all playing it. Also, it would be helpful if there was a better indicator, at least at the start of the game, as to when is best to land a trick, either on the rail or on the ground.But, these negative points are more nitpicks than anything. The only real negative point that I could think of is that the price is just a couple dollars too high. If it were $10, I'd have NO PROBLEM telling everyone to buy this game. And even at its price, you should pick it up."

This game is insanely hard and unforgiving, the ""amateur"" mode is the basic mode you will play, and I'm scared to even attempt the extra mode, the main levels start out relatively fun but the game soon jumps drastically in difficulty. This is not a skateboarding game, this is a game all about speed and timing, I used a controller to play and the game only uses the left stick and the A button, it requires you to push up on the stick to perform an Ollie, you can try pushing different directions to pull off better tricks but most of the time I find that you don't have the time between jumps to actually land any of them and if you mess up even slightly it will ruin your entire run forcing you to start all over again, also whenever you come down to the ground you are required to ""land"" your trick by pressing the A button at the correct time before you hit the ground, missing that perfect moment will result in a ""Sloppy"" or ""Sketchy"" landing which will completely ruin any momentum you have gained if it doesn't cause you to bail immediately. This game would be much more fun with some sort of free skate or casual mode but instead I found it insanely frustrating just trying to get through the basic levels, I was ready to throw my controller through the wall several times. Most levels pretty much require you to grind the entire way and if you miss even slightly you will lose all speed and bail, trust me this will happen A LOT, I had several times where even though I know I hit the button at the right time it didn't register and gave me a sloppy landing resulting in me failing several levels in a row I eventually gave up once I hit level 5 because it requires such perfect timing yet like I said it sometimes does not register so even if you think you're getting good at this game it can still get glitchy and you will fail due to no fault of your own. I eventually gave it another try after a few months and finally got past level 5. If you like insanely challenging and unforgiving games and playing the same levels over and over and over until you get it right then go for it but if you get frustrated easily don't even touch this game unless you have an unlimited supply of extra controllers.It can be a fun game, but it is def not a casual skateboarding game like most would expect and having to perfectly time a button press just to land your tricks takes a lot of the fun away and just causes more frustration.P.S.

The gameplay is somewhat a mix between skate and tony hawk's pro skater. The tricks are done by flicking the left stick in a specifc direction i.e. skate but unlike skate you have to press A to stick your landing(a perfect timing will get you more points).At first the challenge is to finish the stages but once you master the control scheme the stages become fairly easy and then you have challenges to complete on each level. Like in the pro skater games you have to complete the challenge within the run. There are 25 amateur levels and a pro variant on each level (completing all challenges will unlock the pro level) and also includes a daily generated level for you to compete for the best score. This game has a lot for the price if you want a challenge and/or like to score chase then this game is for you.

If you like the skateboarding theme and like ""arcady"" games give it a try. Has replayability, fastpaced gameplay and a simple yet cool artstyle (pixelated). Soundtrack is awesome too!Problems: Keyboard and mouse is annoying to play with. I recommend a gamepad controller which feels much more natural.Story: No story, you don't play this for a story.Mechanics: It's a 2d sidescrolling skateboardgame. It's pretty technical when it comes to the tricks almost like EA Skate (flick stick) more than Tony Hawkes (press button-combinations). The game is about pulling off tricks and timing your landing for better score. There's like 5 different acts with 10 levels each (5 normal and 5 pro-levels). In the levels there are stairs, rails, ledges and objects that make you fall. On each level there are a few goals you have to achieve before you can proceed to the next one. If you make them all you unlock the corresponding pro-level which is harder.Playtime/replayability: Room for replayability since there are leaderboards. Depending on your skill level it will take different amounts of time to play through all level (probably around 5 hours). If you decide to complete all goals on all levels you're probably looking at 20+ hours of gametime.Why I recommend it: Simple artstyle, AMAZING soundtrack, responsive arcade game, the pricetag is worth the money. If you like skateboarding and wanna play a fun game ever once in a while, buy this! Just a heads up, there is a lot of trial and error, you might become angry or frustrated with the game if you play for too long."
