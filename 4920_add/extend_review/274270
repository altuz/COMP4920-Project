,Recommended,274270,21573268,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,Tom,"NOT A HERO is a tactical shooter game developed by Roll7. The game was released on PC in May 2015. A PS4 version of the game was released in February 2016; unfortunately the PS Vita version was cancelled.Gameplay in Not A Hero is focused quite heavily around cover based combat.  Each level you are given a main objective which you must complete in order to finish the stage, but there are also three optional objectives which you can do to raise your score. These optional objectives can often be done at the same time as the regular main mission, but some of them you have to go out of your way for.  Gameplay is done from a side scrolling view, and your character has a range weapon, but can also roll into enemies to knock them to the ground allowing you to execute them in one shot whilst they are stunned.  You unlock new characters depending on how high your score is, all of the different characters have their own unique model, style of combat move set. The missions can vary from simply clearing a stage out of enemies right the way to escorting your aunt through an enemy gang headquarters.  This game goes to the real extremes of the spectrum.The graphics are the tried and testing pixel style, and whilst this form is becoming ever more popular, Not A Hero’s style just looks a lot cleaner and crisper than most pixel games.  The simplistic character sprites are all really carefully put together and you are really able to get a feel for how the character should act just from the visuals from these pixelated avatars.  Due to the game being based in UK, there are some absolutely brilliant stereotypical voice acting to be heard too; some of it had me in stiches with the accents and local slang being used.Plot wise, I absolutely loved Not A Hero, a purple rabbit called BunnyLord has come back in time to be elected as mayor to save your world from an alien invasion. You follow BunnyLord on his campaign trail to try and persuade the public to elect him by cleaning up crime in the city under his name. BunnyLord hires assassin’s to do his dirty work whilst he reaps the rewards, you are the assassin.This game is really hard and extremely unforgiving. There are a number of enemies that can kill you in one hit, and there are often at times more than a handful of enemies shooting at you from down a corridor you can’t often see down. You have to make real use of all the cover you can and time your movement and shots perfectly without getting you’re self-covered in bullet holes. The game has taken me just over twenty hours to complete the story; and I have only barely completed it too. You are able to get a higher score by the end of the game by also completing the optional objectives each mission has.  The higher score you have, the more characters you can unlock.  The game’s only replay ability factor will only be worthwhile for people who are focused on these high scores, your average joe will more than likely be happy with the one play through of this game. I personally don’t see myself playing it any more than I already have.I only had one technical issue whilst playing; that was the game would not run in full screen mode. Whilst the game ran fine in windows mode, it was more of an annoyance that I couldn’t run it. I would strongly recommend anyone playing this game to use a controller though, the platforming nature and controls layout really gives you the advantage on a controller over a keyboard.To sum up, NOT A HERO is a really good game. Whilst the game play ideas aren’t as original as I would have hoped, the rest of the production values are all very high quality. Fantastic voice acting and visually pleasing art style does this game massive favours. The comical value also holds massive positives for this release as well. This game would be even better if there was a local co-op mode included as it is a perfect format for it.  The price point of £9,99 is really fair given the amount of content to get through as well.

But this game's challenges and game design can sometimes be GOD FRUSTRATING.And it only get worse at final levels.You will find yourself using only 1-2 characters because of samurais and ninjas at the final levels.This game doesn't want you to use pistol using characters, they're most of the time useless.You will never use stive (black submachine using character) because he is slow and he's submachine that is supposed to be good against crowds of people is not that effective.The cover system is god awful, you clearly can't defend it.Sometimes it looks like this game just want itself to be hated, but the game itself is pretty good.Puns are very clever and funny.

While Not A Hero is fun for an hour or two, it quickly gets incredibly repetitive. It all comes down to this; after the novelty of the cool concept goes away, this game gets incredibly boring.Much like in Hotline Miami (which shares the same publisher as Not A Hero), you'll constantly be dying and restarting in this game. This is the games biggest flaw. Unlike in Hotline Miami, I never felt motivated to continue. The gameplay itself is slow, save for the first few levels. You and your enemies can take multiple hits, which makes the game impossible to speed through like you would in HM. Because of that, I never felt that rush to jump right into another try. I just felt so...bleh. After 2 hours, i felt like I was doing the same levels over and over again with no variety. I also never felt satisfied with my deaths. In HM, I always feel like my deaths were fair and occured because I made a mistake. However, in NAH, I felt like all of my deaths were the game's fault, not mine. The cover system, which is the main selling point of this game, just feels unfinished. I'll tap the buttin to go into cover, only to stop a litltle short, which I won't realize until an enemy fills me with bullets.The game tries to create some variety by giving you different characters to play as, but about halfway through the game, you're almost required to use one of the shotgun characters, Cletus or Mike, in order to take out the late game bullet sponges. This game also really could have benefitted from some good music. Instead, you get to listen to one of the most bland soundtracks of all time.I applaud Roll7 for trying to make you unique game, but Not A Hero just gets too repetitive and boring. If a sequel is ever made with faster, twitch gameplay and more variety, I'll be first in line to get it, but for now, I'd stay away from this game."

Each level seems to be a copy and paste scene with copy and pasted characters from previous levels. The limited controls and bizarre keybinds puzzled me, because through options you couldn't change the arrow keys to i don't know... the WASD keys AND you couldn't change the shoot, roll, and special weapon keys either. You'll find yourself about 30 minutes into the game wondering why you bought the game when you realize that there is nothing unique in the upcoming levels and that the Bunny's little speeches before levels don't benefit you whatsoever.Overall, a nice concept and story line but bad execution made me very down on this game.Worth $12? Maybe. Not a first choice for $12 games though"

,Recommended,274270,15920150,"Posted: 20 May, 2015",all,Messofanego,"A positively British game in the most vulgar of ways. Full of character, figuratively and literally. I want to make comparisons to Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie but I feel this is less indulgent about the style and just wants to have confident fun about it all. The developers at Roll 7 know exactly what they wanted to do, there are no muddled messages here. Even if you're doing horrible things in the name of electing a mayor, it's all done in an endearing juvenile manner. Great music, aesthetic, colour palette, gameplay, ultraviolence, 80s nostalgia, character animations, and attitude. From the various playable characters with their own accents/memorable quotes/gameplay style, to the endearingly satirical approach to politics by just smashing crime in its horrendous face.BunnyLord has come back from the future and tried multiple ways to fix the world but in the end, the only effective solution is such a juvenile one to kill all the ""bad guys"" and elect him as mayor (or even Global Megalord). You play an anti-hero or in BunnyLord's exceedingly randomised and memorably hilarious words, ""an amazeballs pigeon-hero of crime-fighting justice"", as part of a growing cast of characters in BunnyLord's Fun Club during the 21 days before his election. You have to clean up three districts with their own colour palette, aesthetic, and crime boss. The game is full of little touches that gives the game a lot of personality that you won't find in most shooters. BunnyLord's debriefings and post-mission dialogue can be a bit long, but there's love and care for details like hanging out at Aunt Ruby's for milkshakes which bring happiness no matter what even if they sometimes contain a bit of frog, or having fun with crayons. Each time, BunnyLord's adjectives or nouns might change, even down to different things to collect in a level. Sometimes, your face might come out bruised after a mission. Even if you don't care for a character, hearing all their region-specific dialogue during levels and on the character select screen is a treat. Whether they're a cockney lad (Steve), a Welsh run-and-gun lady (Samantha), a Scottish not-hillbilly (Cletus), a posh John Woo dual-pistol suit-wearing smoker (Clive reloads with a smoke), a black SMG wielder who stores ammo and his knife in an afro (Stanley), or a cutesy looking sword gal who swears constantly and can shoot while executing. After many of the levels, the dark humour is apparent when maybe the people you killed was a mistake but how glib about it all BunnyLord is sells the carefree attitude that's present throughout the game.While it might bear similarity to games like Hotline Miami, Elevator Action, Blackthorne, or Gunpoint in certain elements (an arcade-ish skillful 2D shooter with vertical level design), how it plays when combined feels like its own thing. Sliding, getting into cover, slide tackling, executing, slashing, goring, all feel satisfying thanks to very snappy controls. In very few instances, when sliding and falling down below (day 18 specifically), the cover magnetism can go against you and end up falling right into a samurai's blade. It all feels intuitive and is a blast to get good at so you can master the levels by obtaining the Global Megalord rank on each level. Each level will have side objectives which are challenges, and many of the levels can be quite tricky. There is nuance to the level design in each of them that you'll want to familiarise yourself with to get the GM rank. Sometimes, it's just a case of unlocking the right character, but mostly it's down to trial-and-error, memorisation, and muscle memory, which makes for a lot of replayability. It's not a case of just one character being best for one level, as the characters I have chosen to GM certain levels have been different from others' experiences. Clive's bi-directional special shooting might be great for levels where enemies come at you from both sides. Mike (a functioning alcoholic) might be great if you want to use less bullets and stab everyone silently. Jesus (the sexy spanish hip-thrusting kind) is great for timed challenges because he can move while executing in a spin dance.Speeding through these levels while sliding around, melee executing, shooting from cover, and utilising the powerups at the right times turns the game into a badass simulator. The bosses are not usually straight up bosses with long health bars but rather dictated by the level design. The ending of each of these boss encounters, animation-wise, is an absolute brutal treat. It took me 20 hours to get the GM rating on every level. The replayability is incentivized even more by having 4 possible endings (Mayor, Prime Minister, King, Global Megalord) with their own end screen and an epilogue exchange with a certain special character. Each of the endings are hilarious in their own way, so don't fret about getting the ""good"" ending although the Global Megalord epilogue is worth the hard work.It's an awesome game throughout, full of personality, and one of my favourite games of 2015 so far. Go tickle some criminals in the teeth.Made a playlist for my playthrough of GM'ing the levels:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4fyeE7-K5BnJzpw_rsemZhN19tKhsxRr"
,Recommended,274270,22540165,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,Auburok,"This game's okay. There's a few problems:Lack of contentSameyControlsFirst off: lack of content. There's not a lot to do, and the gameplay, while fun at first, gets rather old in a short amount of time. You unlock characters as you complete more objectives in levels (approval rating) and once you unlock a few characters there's no reason to use any of the others ever again. Mike is by far one of the best characters, and it's really odd that they'd have so many characters and make two of them a lot better than the rest. This game isn't difficult, and most of the difficulty I would say is a battle against the controls, so the content's duration is ""padded"" with a little bit of frustration. More on that later.The content that is there is somewhat... repetitive. There are three zones with 7 levels and some secret levels. Different zones have different enemies and themes. but only the enemies are really at all different, some marginally so. It took me about 5.5 hours to complete everything in the game, including achievements. Honestly, if you don't go for all the objectives, it'd probably take you around 1 or 2 hours. I think the asking price is a little high for this amount of content. A full completion would take less time if it wasn't for the next issue.The controls are pretty bad, especially on keyboard. The analog stick control is terrible, and I ended up using my Steam controller to try to compensate for it (the default controls are... mushy). Maybe it's better with an Xbox/PS controller dpad, but I can't imagine it would be. There's a button to reload, for special weapons, shooting and dodging/cover. I REALLY wish cover/dodge were on separate buttons, as most of the issues I had with completing challenges was because of context issues; sometime's I'd be rolling when I wanted to take cover, sometimes I'd take cover when I needed to roll. It's also worth mentioning that youcan'trebind keyboard controls, so gamepad is the way to go.Honestly, this game isn't ""bad"", but it's not something I'd recommend that you ""must play"". In fact, most people could skip this game. The premise is interesting, but the execution just sort of fizzles out by the end. I think that if controls were tighter, if there were more actions or some sort of weapon system, or if there were bosses or something it would be more interesting. I'd wait until it's 3-5 bucks."
,Recommended,274270,23355314,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Browniemixx,"As one who's familiar with the games that Devolver publishes (Pixelated, gory, fine soundtrack) then it should already be clear to you if you'll want to buy this game because it is no exception.The uniqueness about this is that it's a cover based shooter featureing a MASSIVE variety of character sounds from the playables and enemies alike. Each level has it's own song and there are 3 palleted chapters with their own boss. The humor slips right in with Battleblock Theaters with rgn styled quips from the main character Bunnylord whenever you start or finish a level. Story is pretty much what you already know from the trailer and description: purple anthromorphic rabbit travels from the future to save it by becoming mayor, and how do you ask? By shooting crime in it's well deserved head.There are 9 playable characters you can unlock by increasing voter approval adding enough variation to find the right one that sticks and they each come with their own witty dialogue in every situation. (My personal favorite is Mike)Some of the later levels can be a bit frustrating as you are introduced to specific instant-kill type enemies. A major gripe I've had was with the lack of proper key maping or even allowing such a thing in general, seriously, I can't run with the arrow keys on my right hand when shooting, sliding, and reloading with the other.I've come to reccomend this as the pros greatly outweight the cons so anyone looking for more goofy gorey devolver action Not a Hero is the one for you."

The controls are also pretty bad, and having the roll and cover command be binded to the same button makes the ""Don't get punched"" side-missions quite hard.EDIT:I've now completed the game except for the final boss, and it really doesn't get any better. The third set of levels looks different but plays almost exactly the same except for a few new enemy types including a samurai that has an instant kill attack, which gets EXTREMELY frustrating during the longer levels, because you have to start from the beginning when you die.

,Recommended,274270,24489909,"Posted: 23 July, 2016",all,Baphomet,"NOT A HERO is a tongue in cheek comedic high violence platformer starring you as one of the many assistants to an enigmatic character known as Bunnylord. Your purpose in the game is to complete various missions for BL in the hopes of helping him to win an election.The graphics are pretty retro, but not offensively so. The music is catchy and the characters’ banter entertaining. As far as gameplay goes, the concepts are fairly simple (shoot, enter cover, reload, dash, tackle, execute) and can be picked up fairly quickly after the first tutorial mission. Depending on the character you choose, your style of run and gun will differ and some people will be easier to play on certain levels than others.I kind of liked the limited mobility factor in that you cannot jump in this game and must instead make your way up various nearby buildings and dive through windows to progress in some areas. The slide tackle mechanic is also a nice addition and combined with execution, if timed right, it can make for a downright frantic yet rewarding experience. Some enemies in the game are immune to the aforementioned combo and must be dealt with in other ways.Overall I think this is a nice game that yields around 7-10 hours depending on whether or not you want to get the full ending or just clear it. Some of the levels have some really hard challenges like “don’t get punched” or some sort of time-based objective, which can be kind of a drag if you manage to finally pull it off and then die or get punched right near the end of a level (this happened to me a lot). That being said, this game regularly goes on sale for less than $5 and is a total steal at that price. Worth it just for the voice acting and goofy plot."

,Recommended,274270,29132872,Posted: 8 January,all,Bass][e,"★★★★☆I'm torn on this one. First, I'd like to stress how much personality this game has. You won't forget Bunnylord and the overall style of this game. It does remind us of Hotline Miami with its violence and color scheme, but it has its own twist of humor, with lot's of funnny voice acting and characters to enjoy. Maybe kinda cheesy for some, but it will make you chuckle at some points.But humor and style ain't enough: it's the challenging gameplay that should take the cake in these kind of violent games. It's fast-paced, intense and bloody. You don't need to master to game to play through the campaign, but eventually you want to get all the objectives crossed off the list. This gets good once you get the appropiate characters you unlock. But these objectives get underminded by some mechanics of the game.For instance, the objective ""don't get punched"" sounds way easier than it is, in contrast to another objective like ""reach the reported in x amount of seconds"". However, after finishing the game, I still don't get WHY I can't tackle an enemy but get punched instead. Is it because he is shooting? Or because he is reloading? In either case, I had a 50% chance of successfully tackling him. Another problem is taking cover (which you do with the same button as with tackling). Sometimes my character wouldn't take cover at the column right in front of him, but instead slight right into the fist of an enemy behind that column. This was headache inducing, especially in the last level.I did get bored with it at times since the game does get repetiive, It helped to take long breaks, and continnue form where I left of, and discover the new characters. (btw: the game has no cloud saves, so dont uninstall of you plan to come back some day.)Try out the game. Get a refund if it doesn't gell with you, which I would totally understand. Personally, I was suprised that this game was made by only one guy, which I think is atleast worth mentioning.As for the DLCI'd say its inferior to the main game. You only get 3 more levels, and you can only use 1 character, Bunnylord. The levels are tough, and it sucks that you can't switch characters. One new enemy is introduced, which I don't like at all (a teleporting dog with a gun, which pretty much just stops my killstreak everytime). Get it when it's on sale for a buck, as you won't spent more than two hours with it, thats including repeated attempts to perfect a level."
,Recommended,274270,32900981,Posted: 27 June,all,Colonel Gentleman,"A cute little pixel action shooter packed to the gills with English nonsense banter.  NOT A HERO takes the action of Bro Team and speed of BUTCHER and puts it into an inner city tactical run and gun style game where you are a gun for hire doing the mayor elect’s dirty work to help him get elected… to save the world?  Theirs serious murder and bloodshed as you end the lives of crooks as they beg for their lives after you stun them.  But that’s alright because your character always has a quip to clear the air.  Speaking of characters, you can choose from quite a few which can change the flavor of the game.  However only a select few are the cream of the crop and the rest just pose artificial challenge in the long run.  There are pickups, upgrades, and bosses as well to keep things fresh as you slide and fly through each glass shattering level.The game is fairly short and quick but does offer additional challenges on each level to improve your ending. The music is satisfyingly and the story is simple and at times, completely random with the mad yammerings of your “Bunny Lord” to justify his rash behavior and reward you between levels.  All an all, a decent game for the price and a quick romp if you are looking for something quick and light hearted."

That's part of the difficulty, which is fine, but it leads me to my next issue;-The controls: My biggest issue. It's just awkward to play on a keyboard and you can't remap key-bindings to something comfortable. I had to play on a controller and remap to something I liked and it still felt clunky.Reload is tough to keep track of with fast enemies that only advance when you reload.Sliding feels ok, until it slows down, but still feels a little wonky to do.I couldn't remap ""shoot"" to a trigger on my 360 pad, so I have to use the shoulder buttons.-There's no way of knowing how much health an enemy has left, and some of them are real bullet sponges-Your health audio for when you're two ""bars"" away from death and one bullet away from death is that same.-Death: It just feels punishing. You usually don't actually know what ultimately killed you unless it's a one-on-one fight.-Dialog: It's well written and funny, but it's TOO SLOW. It goes past comedic timing and enters exhausting when it's pushing two sentences every 25 seconds and there is a paragraph of stuff to move through. I usually hit the 75% mark and skipped the rest just to get back to the game, and skipped almost all the post-level stuff because of this.All this said, I like the game. It's fun, it's colorful, it's a laugh and it's violent. It just feels like a mash up of other, more tight, Devolver games without the fine tuning to really slam it home for me."

But once you reach the final third of the game, it becomes unbearably difficult for no reason. There is no gradual rise in difficulty, just a straight-up, right-in-your-face sharp spike in difficulty that makes playing this game feel more like a chore than a fun activity.For example, they introduce enemies that can kill you in one hit, ones that can dodge your bullets AND kill you in one hit, and ones that can teleport.2)Fake Physics- This is a pixel platformer shoot 'em up, and in many cases it tries to throw in physics to that mix. Instead of working well, it creates weird mechanisms that cause you to miss jumps, fall to your death, run into explosions and/or enemy fire, and get knocked around like a hacky sack, exposed to the millions of bullets flying throughout the level. Sometimes physics likes to kick in, sometimes it doesn't. The game decides for you, sporatically, causing deaths and restarts based on nothing but a fault in the game.tl;dr Not a Hero isn't a bad game but it has flaws that make it unrecommendable"

The game does have that Hotline Miami “quick restart” feel to it if you ask me. After playing for about 2 hours I figured out that you can pause right when the death animation starts. This means that you can pause and restart quickly. Sadly the loading screen takes a bit but it shaves off a second or four.The game has a really nice flow to it and you can instantly see that some levels are designed to be played with a certain character. Sometimes this is because you have to get to a payphone in time which would be impossible if you’re not playing as Jesus or Mike or because there are hordes of enemies that require less finesse. The flow that results from nailing combos at a high rate feels amazing. The game promotes you gaining a flow like that by doing little things like allowing you to execute two enemies at once, or not penalizing you speed-wise for getting damage.The thing that annoys me about this game though is that a lot of the levels depend on you getting a certain ammo power up in the beginning of the level. A great example of this is when you have to fight the boss Upgraydd. To get to the payphone you have to go through two “heavy” enemies. This means that you have to pause and pump a lot of bullets into them. This takes a lot of time and you won’t be to reach the pay phone in time unless you get a power up that kills enemies in a single shot such as the drill bullets.The game is awesome though and it’s a good example of what a game with a great combo flow looks like."

You might be asking yourself, the answer is simple.He will kill Crime on the face.There are 27 playable mission plus 4 hidden bonus levels.Like I said before, the game is pretty much Hotline Miami in a lateral view BUT with several differences.1.- Your objective isnt strictly to kill everyoneOne of the novelties in this game is that you have multiple objectives according to the mission, you will rarely have to kill everyone, you will mostly have to go from point A to B, of course, you will probably kill everyone on the way but meh details.2.- Optional objectivesYou have 3 aditional objectives alongside your main objective, these often rank from: Collect ""X"" ""Y"", Save ""X""/All hostages, kill everyone, finish the level with a time limit, use no more than ""X"" ammo or Go to point A to B with a time limit.These objectives give a little bit of variety to the gameplay and they heavily affect it because:3.- CharactersAnother novelty of Not a Hero are the multiple characters, they all have different abilities and skills, encouraging you to play with all the different characters. The characters are unlocked by getting a determinated amount of Approval rating, which you get by - you guessed it - finishing the objectives, the more you finish, the more  you Approval rating you get.But... Here goes the first problem of Not a Hero.Lack of balance between charactersI can give 2 clear examples about this1.- Jesus2. - MikeJesus is one of the fastest characters, he has a bunch of ammo that he will quickly fire, he can fire it even while rolling which makes him invulnerable while he is attacking, the only weakness I can think of are the enemies with tons of health and large distance weapons, since his range is kinda short. But even then, as long as there is a safe spot (And there will be one) he can safely wait until the enemy comes close enough and then unload all his ammo. His executions are quick so he can just knock over a lot of enemies and then shoot them.Mike is the fastest character, his executions are not only light fast, but silent, you can take a whole room filled with enemies without ever wasting a bullet and in a microscopical amount of time. He has a shotgun with 2 bullets, while this seems like a balance technique, the shotgun is amazingly effective, be close enough and you can take a mammoth down with one shot, since there arent a lot of enemies you cant just knock over and kill, the limited ammo is not an actual limitation and you can safely reload after you finished that one enemy. He is the most OP character in the game, if you look at speedruns, walkthroughs with all objectives, etc. They all pick Mike. And its not like you could only get him early in the game, he appears fairly early.The other characters  only work efficiently for certain objectives and scenarios being Mike and Jesus a much more better option than the rest.But what was all that roll, health and stuff I talked about? Well...4.- Multiple movementsYou are not restricted to just move, shoot, toss and punch. Here you have a rolling move, with the rolling move, you have increased mobility and you are able to knock out enemies, while they are in the floor, you can perform an execution but this is a bad idea since it will take a long time and it will attract the attention of other enemies, so aside of a few objectives there isnt a reason to do this (Unless you are Mike) Since you can easily put yourself in a position where you can easily crit them. What do I mean by ""crit them""? Simple, if you shoot an enemy up close, you will crit them, dealing intense damage, usually one shooting the enemy in question. If you roll, you can also take cover, you will stop at a cover place (there are many)  and you will be safe from all bullets, but of course, if you want to shoot you will need to expose yourself, you can exit the cover by simply walking or rolling again. You can also use special use items such as granades between other kinds of cool stuff you find through the levels.Not a Hero also counts with powerups! Finding these through the levels grants an instant reload and adds an effect to the player's primary weapon, however they are still unbalanced. There are power ups such as Hot shot that one shot enemies and there are other power ups like that purple one that arent really useful.I really like Not a Hero's levels, the previously mentioned elements makes them pretty unique and good, but If I had to make a complain... It would be the bosses. They arent really bosses, they are just Go from point A to B, it was quite disapointing that 2 out of the 3 bosses in the game worked put this way and even then, the last boss isnt really all that great. The one I did felt as a boss was The Chopper who ironically was a Mini Boss rather than a Boss.I would also like to notice that the 4 extra levels are completly pointless outside getting the achievement for finding them, they dint really contribute to the Approval rating and if you miss them out, you arent missing anything, while they are extra content and that is good there isnt really a reason to complete them at 100%.The humor in Not a Hero is pretty random (Partially due to the use of randomly generated talking nonsense) and I dont think is particulary funny. Graphics are pretty meh, shining more on background than anything and the music I can only remember 2 or 3 tracks.Overall Not a Hero is a somewhat solid game. It needs more balance on all aspects, better boss battles, it has an average technic work and I believe is a fun game."

The game is fast paced, the action is brutal and the controls are rock solid. The game has a good amount of levels with decent replayability if you want to complete all of the secondary objectives to get the other endings.

Check out the full video review on our Youtube channel!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAMWTaot-2ENot A HeroBunny Lord, a bunny currently running for Mayor, in lists the help of his ""fun club"" to help him get elected into office. The only problem is the city is being harassed by a number of gangs, each of which needs to be dealt with in their own way. The fun club  is motley crew of mercenaries and gun enthusiasts, who just want to see the job done. The story is told entirely through the perspective Bunny Lord; he tells you about the missions, in his own crude manor, mostly in Aunt Ruby's Diner. Bunny Lord is quite enthusiastic about becoming a person of power, and he'll do anything to win the election. He also talks at length about things that seem irrelevant to the story; not unlike Tarantino does in his films. He also often makes up words to show his enthusiasm or hate for something, making his character fun to just listen too. This game certainly isn't lacking character.Not a Hero is a 2D side scrolling shooter, with a variety of weapons, enemies, and objectives. Everyone has the same vulnerability to bullets, putting you on a level playing field with your enemies. This adds a dynamic to runs, by making it near impossible to take on a large group without the help of some special weapons or tactics. Each move you make must be methodical; or face the onslaught of enemies that are just around the corner. Having regenerating life bar is helpful in long levels, but doesn't feel like a crutch because of the time needed to fill it. The game play feels well balanced, and rewards skilled players while torturing novices. while enemies are tripped up on the ground you can perform a satisfying execution, which can help you stay stealthy. You can't be shy about busting into a room guns blazing, because it could be your only option; and damn is it fun.Choosing a class can be critical to the missions failure or success. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and are suited for their own unique situations. The variety of classes is refreshing as well. When having trouble on a level, a change of class can be the simplest solution. You will almost be forced to switch classes at some point, as it is difficult to navigate every level in the game using only one classes move set. The classes all use relatively the same mechanics, but with different weapon types, speeds, and ammo caps; they all manage to feel different. Steve and Samantha are fairly easy to use straight shooters; and Samantha being able to shoot, reload and run is a definite advantage. Cletus and Mike are the shotgun wielders, but have distinct attributes. Cletus has a 5 shell pump shotgun, while Mike prefers the more powerful double barreled shotty. Jesus and Clive make sprinting through levels a breeze, being able to shoot and run, and having special abilities like booting down doors and spinning executions. The classes are well balanced with few exceptions, and playing everyone of them adds something to the dynamic of not being a hero.Levels are based around you completing an objective in that location, then escaping in Bunny Lord's van. Sometimes the assault feels to easy, and is quickly assured by the escape being a brutal firefight. These objectives all serve Bunny Lord's campaign in some way, whether your stealing valuable cheese, blowing up grow ops, freeing panda hostages, or just massacring everyone in sight. Even the police stand in your way at time, but Bunny Lord just reasons they must have been crooked cops, so it was actually a good thing... maybe. Each individual level also has three side objectives, that when completed give you a better score on that level and an overall higher approval rating among voters. In order to get the highest score on a level you must complete all three tasks and race to the exit. These side objectives include challenges like: completing the level in a set time limit, not getting punched or shot, collecting random objects, and performing a number of executions or critical hits. Using different classes to try and increase your rating on  levels adds a ton of replay value to the entire game.What many players will enjoy is the difficulty the game puts forth. It's just enough for people to get frustrated but still be addictive. Every death feels like the players fault, as opposed to the game being short with you. Players will get much better the more they play, and developing skills is necessary to finishing late game levels. At first the players are weakened by the lack of class selection, but soon clearing levels becomes a breeze. The fact that this game has a blunt learning curve is much appreciated. Players would rather feel as though they are getting better at playing the game, as opposed to beefing up their characters to unstoppable ends. Faulting the player with their own deaths, makes the game that much more addicting; ""I could have beaten that part if I just did this"". Every time a level feels frustrating the, simplest solution could be just a change of class. This entire game puts the player in control, which seems obvious but can be hard to find in other games like it.On the surface, Not a Hero is a simple shoot'em up. Digging deeper will reveal a quirky, movie like story, and deep game play mechanics that are easily accessible, and enjoyable. Not many games manage to pay homage to a movie genre, at the same time as having a crazy fun game design and story. There also seems to be no limits to the options of DLC: such as new boroughs to fight through, and new classes to help us do it. Not a Hero comes easily recommended to any kind of gamer for hours of excitement and replayability. So in the end heroes are over rated. All hail Bunny Lord.- Steampunks"

It turns the bonus goals into something that's more frustrating than fun to achieve, and, once you stop trying to get those, the appeal of the game disappears, as the gameplay is otherwise, fairly repetitive and relies heavily on the bonus goals to keep it interesting and varied.

,Recommended,274270,21685009,"Posted: 7 March, 2016",all,Scout,"Not A Hero is a 2D Action game. The game is about trying to get a giant purple bunny named Bunnylord to be elected mayor of England to prevent the world from being obliterated.The game has 22 stages, where the game primarily involves sliding, executing, moving into cover, and shooting enemies. The gameplay isn't anything spectacular , but it is kinda unique in the way you engage enemies. The action is really fast and frantic. The way to kill enemies is to either shoot them to death, shoot them once at close range for a critical kill, or slide the enemy to trip them up and then execute them while they're on the ground. There are not too many variants of enemies. There are pretty much normal guys with pistols, normal guys with SMGs, big guys with powerful weapons, and ninjas with katanas. Some can be slide tackled and some can't. Anyway, the gameplay itself is fun. It can be a challenge on later levels as well, so it's not a pushover either.There are 9 characters you can choose from, and they all have different speed, guns, and abilities. For example, Mike is very fast, has a double-barreled shotgun with very quick executions, while Stanley has a mid-range SMG with a large clip, but moves very slow. They all take advantage of different aspects of the game. Some can shoot while sliding, some are better at close or long range, etc. There's bound to be a character you'll enjoy, and it really adds variety to all the levels. The only issue I have is the controls are kind of iffy. Moving from cover to cover is easy enough, but cancelling out of a slide can be hard or just won't work properly. It doesn't happen that often though, I just noticed it a bit is all.Each level has one objective that you must complete to beat the game, but there are also 3 optional objectives you can do. Each mission you complete will earn you more approval ratings which will unlock characters quicker. (You only start out with one character) This will make the game much harder as some missions will take lots of tries to do, but ti's nothing painful or keyboard-breaking.22 levels might sound like a lot, but it's actually pretty short. It took me a little under 9 hours to beat the game will all objectives done 100%. Shave a few hours off if you intend to only beat the game doing the primary goal. This is a bit of a downside, but it is a fun and engaging experience regardless of length.All in all, Not A Hero is a fun and addictive action game that I'm sure you'll have fun with in the short time you'll have with it. Depending on how strongly you want this, it might be better to wait for sale.7/10."

Unfortunately, even in the hours I have put in it (only 3.6 hours so far) it has become extremely repetitive and the jokes which were funny in the first hour are already stale.It's alright. I don't recommend purchasing it unless $2.50 and you acknowledge that you are getting a story-less, repetitive 2D shooter with minor puzzle elements.The trailer of the game made me think it'd be crazier with more activities. I should have watched gameplay. Even then, I still would have purchased it at the low cost I did. At full price, the humor/charm would not be enough to carry it for very long."

It has an original and funny storyline, great characters and the artstyle is wonderfull.But jesus christ the mechanics are the worst. The game has a certain flow of making you dash through enemies by killing them quickly by either shooting them or stabbing them. But whenever you try to melee them they often just bounce you back and shoot you in the face or you get bounced off a building. Nice mechanic. Also, hiding prevents you from getting shot, but only from the direction you're standing towards. Which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because you only get one side to stand towards and have only one button to use to hide, so when you get surrounded you just freak out instead of switching sides.Long story short:Great story and themeGod awful mechanicsDon't buy this game unless they either fix these mechanics or if you like getting frustrated by bad mechanics."

Random enemies that can not be tackled or one shot you usually disturb the flow of combat.  Game advertises 84 chllanges in the trailer which is quite pathetic. These challenges consist of going out of your way to collect ""lol son random"" items or do the level in a stupidly fast way.

There are only 2 things about this game that bother me:  1) When you die, you have to restart the level from the start (this might not be bad to some people, personally it just gets a bit annoying when you get really close to the end and then die by a simple mistake)     2) It's not too long. The game consists of 21 levels which you can get through pretty quickly for the most part, and I believe 3 secret levels that are hidden.

It's a fast paced game where you shoot and run, you can slide to dodge and run into cover. Thre are several mechanics to kill ennemies, most of them can be executed after sliding on them, and if you shoot them very close you crit them.Overall I find the controls inaccurate for this kind of game, your character tends to go further than you intended, and ennemies have godlike reflexes, the action is often hard to read because the graphics are really bad (and I'm not against pixels because I've enjoyed lots of indy games) and it's really hard to understand where you can get under cover (covers are part of the background scenery).The game is a bit challenging because of this problems.The game asks you to complete 3 objectives on each map.

Second, lots of people have been referencing to Hotline Miami and the like. I have not played those games.Anyways, this game is challenging, but forgiving, which I like. The premise of the story is that you go around completing tasks which will help your bunny acomplice gain points on the polls, which will help him get elected to the mayor of England. The bunny's strategy is to show people he is ready to kill crime in the face, and that is exactly what you do. There are 9 characters to choose from. Although all of them are well balanced and good for different strategies, you unlock them in a linear path, starting with Steve, who is seemingly the most in-between the others, allowing you to play as him without so much as a hiccup until you unlock a character who you end up being really good with. Although the enemies are generally the same until you finish the boss and move on to another gang, the setting, objectives, maps, etc. provide a different expirience every level. This is the first game I had genuine fun with in a long time (other than Half Life 2).EDIT:Currently I'm stuck on the level where you have to blow up the fish tanks, because of a number of things leading to my failure again and again.1. A samarui (which will kill you instantly with their sword) comes at me. I shoot them, but there is a fish tank between us, and they survive and kill me, even though I was playing as Mike, with his really powerful shotgun.2. I slide to cover, but for some reason, I stop halfway and get killed by the hail of gunfire coming whilst I do that.3. I somehowhave 0 bullets when I attempt to shoot a ninja point-blank with my shotgun.PLEASE! PLEASE, I BEG YOU! On the longer levels in china, PLEASE add a checkpoint halfway or something. I need it, otherwise I will rage whilst playing the same thing several times and forget my mistakes, and then make them again until I get lucky once and make it to the end of the level. This is still a great game, but PLEASE! You're killing me guys (both in-game and figuratively)."

The levels at this point are getting pretty long and it sucks that you have to start the whole thing all over again because you died from a swordsman (which instakill kill you when they get close) just because you entered a new room and didn't know the layout. You'll probably manage to make it through this situation after some tries and then you die two rooms later because the enemies surprises you by jumping through the ceiling. Remember you have to do the whole level again each time you die. At this point I decided that this game is just not entertaining enough and stopped playing it.

Maybe they go though some signifigant character arc in a cutsene I wouldnt know. I couldn't muster up the determinaion to play though till the ends as the gameplay is about as satisfiying as watching gravel. It demands skill and restraint while showing none itself, the levels are open ended with mission based collectibles, but theres no way to explore all parts of a level without stairs, ITS A OPENENDED PLATFORMER WITHOUT A JUMP BUTTON, OR ANY WAY OF BACKTRACKING OUTSIDE OF THE SET PIECES. And the ammount of times I jumped in a window and got immediately blown out again I swear there were airbags mounted in the carpet.I'm pretty sure the trailer had a higher production value than the game, samey level design, and I hate the fact the developer thinks""Iso-Vision"" was a good idea. I had no idea what the hell it was, and it's apparently its ""that the game is isometric"". To clarify, iso vision is a joke, it has a website where it acts like a real gameplay feature and I imagine the dev was having a right giggle but honestly it's a little sad.

You cannot get into cover, unless you do a slide, which is meanless, cause if you slide near the group of enemies, you will basically slide into them.- PlotPlot is boring and absolutely uninteresting.

Your boss is an anthro rabbit from the future, and he gives you some ridiculous tasks sometimes. In one level you're murdering drug dealers and in the next you're rescuing giant rat heads. Whatever the case, you need to take down crime bosses in the end, specifically a Russian mob boss, a backstreet gang leader, and a triad yakuza boss.The game is very fast-paced, as I was able to complete the first 2 chapters in only 3 hours. It has the interesting mechanics of ducking for cover and sliding under your enemies to stun them. There are 8 unique characters, each having their own weapon or ability. Cletus wields a shotgun, Ronald uses melee only, ect. One of the more interesting parts of this game is the powerups and usable weapons. With them, you can shoot lasers, explosive rounds, or pretty much anything out of your gun, as well as throw molotovs, ricochet grenades or a cat that explodes near an enemy. There's even secret levels and challenges as you go along, but I could never unlock the secret levels or complete all 3 challenges.Overall, the game has a nice feel to it, although it would help if the soundtrack was a bit better in some cases. I like the pixel graphics and sidescrolling design of it, and it's always fun to play a political game where you can beat someone's face in with a hammer.I rate this an 8.5/10. I would reccommend this to my friends."

But not long into the first act I found myself struggling with the controls which are often clunky and difficult. There aren't many shooting games that require you to manually reload and with good reason because it ruins the flow of the action and I often forget I have to manually reload because again, not many shooting games make you do that. Levels are neatly and colorfully designed but beyond that they very quickly become the definition of repetitiveness. I was interested with the SWAT enemies when they first showed up but that interest quickly turned to anger when I realized that they were literally harder to kill than all the Russians I just shot, not to mention the sheer amount of them, escape became impossible and I died and was forced to do the entire tedious level all over again. Checkpoints exist for a damn reason."

Sorry, that's not going to happen every time I want to play the game.Is this just a game that is going to be released and abandoned with no real support.

,Not Recommended,274270,16656111,"Posted: 23 June, 2015",all,Count Ottula,"This game was... disappointing. Really the only thing that holds up is the humor, and it IS very funny. Bunnylord's randomized speech and what all the characters say, that and the characters themselves, are pretty hilarious, honestly. The actual gameplay is... all in all, confusing. Even just starting the game up for the first time exemplifies this. On a controller, the B and X buttons are used interchangeably as both confirmation buttons AND cancel buttons... just, why? You press the B button to go forward a screen, then that screen will use the B button to go back. If you want to go further you need to press X. It's kinda stupid and confusing, but I guess it's okay once you get used to it. Then there's the combat. Only one character so far (I've unlocked the first four, characters unlock pretty naturally as you play the game, altho doing better at missions will speed up the process) can shoot while moving, and it's extremely inaccurate. The cover system rewards you for being patient. So does the reload time. And the fact that you stop moving when you shoot. So why do most stages have an extremely short time limit? Sure, you can slide past enemies to tackle them to the ground and execute them, but some enemies will kick you away, and there's no indication of which enemies will do that until they actually do that. That's another thing, all the stages and enemies look identical. The first seven enemies take place in warehouses that are all the same color. You fight Russian mobsters with shotguns and pistols, usually pistols. At some point in there, the police show up. They're pretty much identical, just much harder to kill. I probably wouldn't have known that if I hadn't played Hotline Miami first. Hell, the only way I tried killing them that worked was executing them, but that usually got you killed by their swarm of buddies, or putting up a turret, but they burst in through every window as you move past them, so you're encouraged to just run. After that, you move to a different part of town. It's supposed to be a park. It's more warehouses, this time they're green instead of pink. You fight sterotypical ""gangstas"" (they're both white and black, thought that was a nice touch, altho part of me wonders if they didn't do that to keep their asses safe) with pistols, sub-machine guns, and shotguns. This time, the shotgunners don't kick you away, the sub-machine gunners do, altho only specific ones. Makes sense, right? I only got a few stages in, I just couldn't push myself to do it anymore, it just wasn't fun. You really have to take cover here against the SMGers, but they also move in on your position, so you have to be constantly moving, yet constantly shooting, which requires you to stop moving. There are also some degrees of stealth in this game, which I like, altho so far I haven't found any characters that can really capitalize on it. Generally if you fire one shot, everyone knows where you're at, which is accurate at least. I think there are melee characters down the road that can probably kill people without alerting everyone else. But all in all, this was a rather convoluted experience. The game mechanics clash, there is some degree of artificial difficulty, and everything is same-y and boring. Pick this up if it goes on sale for cheap. I paid 9 dollars for it, and it was too much.EDIT: Oh, forgot to mention, the music and sounds are pretty great, but that brings me to another point. This game does not take itself seriously at all, yet enemies beg for mercy when you're about to execute them, only to be abruptly cut off by, well, dying. This even happens with the cops. It's something else that conflicts with the game. It seems rather sadistic, which I'm alright with if it's trying to get a message across, but this is sadism just for sadism, which, again, is okay if the game is at least taking itself seriously, but this one just doesn't."

,Not Recommended,274270,16710400,"Posted: 25 June, 2015",all,RedStep,"Stumbles over its own feet.The core of the game (minus quirks and bugs) is well-conceived - it has an interesting style, the cover mechanic is neat, and figuring out how the abilities of the characters help or hinder you is fun.The first few levels are great - you're figuring out the mechanics and trying to figure out how to complete the extra objectives so you can unlock new characters with new abilities.The problem is that once you get further into the game, these fun mechanics become a weight around your neck. You have to complete all the extra objectives in one run (no going in with one character, getting one, and then bringing another character to get another), so you end up using only one or two. The cover/execution mechanic is nice, until 4 enemies are stacked up so they go wonky.There are no checkpoints, and many missions have a sudden difficulty spike at the end (usually when SWAT teams start pouring into the level for no real reason). The enemies are not randomized, but the powerups are. So you end up doing the exact same movements for the first 80% of a mission, over and over, so you can get back to the shootout at the end that killed you. When there's no challenge in a section but you're forced to replay it over and over (and with no checkpoints your progress is reset anyway), it's really easy to just go for the quit button instead.It's not BAD, but Not a Hero 2 has the potential to be GREAT.Recommendations for the developers (update/sequel):- Make it more like 10 extra objectives per level, that are harder but require different characters. Encourage and reward replays.- Add checkpoints, if only at boss battles / cinematic events. Or split them into mission 10-1 / 10-2, etc.- Get rid of the ""2 people are standing next to each other, so sliding just knocks you down because the second one magically punches you"" mechanic- Add a level editor / something to extend the game and let people think of new scenarios- More characters with more variety (#1 will play into this)- Fix the bug where Xbox One controllers fire constantly (due to it always thinking RT is held down unless you hold LT down)"

In some instances it is similar in that to Dennaton Games' Hotline Miami series these main similarities is obviously the use of pixel style artwork and it's difficult combat. The combat although 2D is actually rather fun as the game uses a simply cover mechanic that is if you press a certain button your character will dash to the next point in cover and become slightly darker to indicate cover is now being used. You also have health in the game 5 bars to be precise which regenerate if given time, I believe if you take the game slowly then the regenerative health can be a bit much but if you opt for the faster route and try to gain the secondary optional goals in a mission then you will find it can disappear quite quickly.In NOT A HERO, you have numerous different characters that have specific traits associated with them on top of their stereotyped voice acting. I have only unlocked a few of these characters but i'll explain one or two, firstly my favourite so far has to be Cletus why? He's Scottish or atleast the voice actor is pretending to be and to add to it his mighty fine nationality he's also from Glasgow, Scotland's very own city of violence and destruction (Huzzah). What does he have that's actually appealing, he has a shotgun as quite the boomstick fan I love a good shotgun who needs accuracy when your wielding a shotgun eh? The shotgun comes with 5 rounds so can be a bit of an issue when reloading and numerous enemies are falling onto you from all directions. You can use the shotgun to blow open doors which can knock out enemies behind it however watch you don't use explosive rounds when you do this I managed to bug the door out with it taking me across the map and eventually getting me killed :P. Another character is Jesus or for some reason i'm compelled to call him Carlos so Carlos (Jesus) is a Spanish passionate dancing nutcase with a bad case of the pelvic thrusts who joins the crew a bit into the game but not that far. His armament of choice is an automatic handgun and the ability to shoot while dashing for cover or across the floor. This may not seem ideal dashing towards a man with a shotgun and his 3 cronies but you'd be surprised how effective it is, the pistol comes with around 20 rounds you can have more if you find the highcapacity magazine pickups though once the ammo is expended it's back to 20. I quite enjoy Carlos (Jesus) as a character and have found myself playing as him rather frequently as his auto pistol does wonders against crowds, my only downside with him is that he fires 3 bullets whilst executing someone so when chaining a few executions together you can find yourself having to reload quickly. Anyways this is only two of the many possible characters that are in the game there is others with sawn-off shotguns, pistols and all sorts of crazy abilities so I'd urge you to experiment if your having difficulty with a level to try other Non-Heros you have at your disposal.There is more I might be able to say regarding the game and how i've experienced it so far but to just summarise it's a very fun 2D gore galore shoot 'em and toot 'em that Hotline fans who are waiting on HM:WN2's workshop to be released should enjoy. Fans of pixel art and a good blast 'em should also enjoy this."

Sometimes get knocked down immediately after going up a floor, sometimes get surrounded by a group of enemies that I can't handle with 1 magazine, and get killed when reloading.Something I don't like in the game:- Roll and take cover use the same button. You roll and at the end if there's a cover nearby you get attached to it. Problem is when I'm already standing near a cover, press that damn roll and cover button just takes myself out to open, and get shot to death.- Way too much randomness. OlliOlli is also hard, but your score only depends on your skill. Here your accuracy and enemy accuracy relies on randomness, enemy AI relies on randomness. You can go straight up like a movie hero and get killed in 2 seconds or kill everyone without getting hit. And that's terrible in a game that rewards you on time and accuracy and less damage taken.- Maps are just floors with doors, feels repetitive yet easy to get lost. You can't jump, only go up or down the stairs, or fall from the window. There is no minimap. In some levels it could take me several minutes to figure out how to get to the exit."

Once the samurai/ninja levels came up, I could only pass them with cletus (because of the one shot kill, they were just too fast for the other characters) - allthough there is one other character with a shotgun and is much faster than cletus, he only has 2 bullets and reloading takes so long that you will be killed by ninja.- strange keyboard configuration, reloading is just irritatingReally too bad, the game has great potential, but If it where my game, I would just give the playable characters unlimited (standard) bullets without reloading and then you can add more baddies, this would give more action to the game and would result in less memorizing."

Well: it's not. Contrary to HM whenever you die you are not even more motivated to start the level again then when you were approaching it first time. No, here when you die you just want to simply turn off the game. For me it was a challenge to play 3-4 levels in a row because they are all but the same (and they are very, very short). Music is mediocre and humor is pretty lame. Repetitive, boring, annoying. These are the three words which come to my mind when i think about NOT A HERO"

The gameplay is mediocre, but enoyable enough. The writing is where it falls absolutely flat. Let me put it this way: If you are twelve years old and find ""lol random spork le maymay"" humor funny, then this will be your jam. If you are a grown♥♥♥♥♥person, skip it. Nearly all of the humor in the game is essentially, ""Haha, I'm saying a random word. Banana!""It's criminally unfunny. A random person off the street could write better comedy. I would honestly be surprised if their writer was over the age of 15. Kudos, I guess, for letting a child express themselves. The kid really needed some guidance though.tl;dr If you want an action game with decent writing, you're not going to find it here. The gameplay is just ok; definitely not enough to prop up the sophomoric ""lol spork! penguin!"" children's humor.I actually ended up returning it since the ""humor,"" a bulk of the game's appeal, fell so utterly flat.Final verdict:BUY: If you're in middle school or below.DO NOT BUY: If you're old enough to legally hold a job."

,Not Recommended,274270,17088364,"Posted: 17 July, 2015",all,Uncle Sparticus,"The game is very fun, very violent, very funny, and has all the ingredients to being an absolutley phenominal game. It is also borderline unplayable from having one of the worst control schemes I've ever encountered in a PC game, with absolutely no ability to rebind the controls at all. Browsing the forum shows that the developers are aware that at least a handful of people want the ability to do this, and have responded by basically saying it's not going to happen.You have to, and I do mean have to, move your character with the arrow keys. Space reloads, X slides (something you'll be doing absolutely constantly, so why they'd put it on the X key I have no idea), C shoots (seriously, the C button on a keyboard is shooting. In a game that's 100 percent shooting.) and V is your secondary weapon (think grenades, etc.)Those are all the controls the game has, except for selecting things in the menu, which is done with, you guessed it, the Enter button. I repeat, absolutely none of these controls can be bound to anything else, at all.Hope you like having your hand in a weird claw shape the whole time you try to play the game, because you're gonna need it. Also hope you're not, I dunno, right handed, because unlike 99.9 percent of all other games on earth, your right hands' on character movement duties in Not A Hero, for some reason!The developers' solution to this appears to be to have you plug an XBOX controller into your computer. I can't speak for if the game plays better on it, because it seems rather silly to go buy a peripheral for a console so that I can play a PC game. I've never had to use a controller on a game before, as rebinding keys is just kind of something every game ever lets you do. Hotline Miami had a nearly perfect control scheme, and they still bothered giving players the option to change it.Hell, I can rebind controls in Half Life. You know, that game that came out nearly twenty years ago. Oh, and in games from the freaking PS1. But for a brand-new PC game, there's no ability to do it nor do the devs intend on adding it, so as is the game is, while not unplayable, way clunkier and less pleasant to play than it has any reason to be.Putting V as the secondary makes the least sense of all, as if your index finger is on C (which it will be, as 99 percent of the game is just mashing the shoot button), you have to move it to hit V, something you will probably not remember to do in the heat of the very, very fast paced combat this game has. Keep in mind, while this sounds like a minor complaint, this game has four total controls, and essentially forces you to use two fingers to use them for no real reason at all.Also, for anyone that minds, the game has no windowed mode and the forum's pretty well silent in terms of dev participation so I can pretty well assume it never will.That all said, the writing's very funny, the action's great when you can get it to actually work, and the whole thing is a black as night comedy that is the kind of thing I'd normally love. The game has tons of content. But none of that really matters when it's so clunky and hard to play, and when it would be maybe ten seconds of coding to fix all of it.I would gladly, gladly retract all this and write a glowing review if the game would just have the ability to rebind controls added, as that's about the only reason I can't recommend this. However, had i known that the controls were so unintuitive and bad prior to buying the game, I would not have bought the game, so I'm hoping maybe this helps someone out there."

However, due to a release delay & several unfortunate control related hiccups at launch it seemingly fizzled away without the usual hype you seem to see from the YouTubers let's playing the current indie darling.This title is a 2.5D (or Iso-slant as they call it) fast paced, pixel art cover shooter. Think Gunpoint mixed with the frantic action of Hotline Miami. You're tasked with helping an anthropomorphic alien known as BUNNYLORD to become mayor. His main strategy which he'll brief you with in hilariously randomized pre-level sequences is to mostly 'kill people very dead awesomely' and also drink milkshakes.Roll7 are an English studio and it tells through this game with almost all the main characters given regional UK dialects. While it doesn't offer much of anything in the way of story or character development, it's a nice touch to distinguish different skill types on your controllable protagonist.While getting from one end of a level to the end isn't particularly difficult, each stage will come with several additional challenges. Most are time or kill streak related & nearing the end of the game, these will require almost pin-point reflexes and stratagem to make it through.While the game itself is a lot of fun, humorous & challenging, the major flaws arrive in that only 1 of the 8 or so unlockable characters (Mike) is actually a viable option to complete the game & all its challenges. While it's still amusing to dabble with the others, more balancing should have been carried out to provide more possiblities in playing the game & using all the characters in a different fashion.Keeping in mind the scope & budget of the game, it would have also been nice to see a bit more story originating from Bunnylord's FUN CLUB members.While perhaps not in the upper echelon of the current golden age of indie steam titles, it's still rather good. Hopefully this won't be the last we see of Bunnylord from Roll7. While it's £10 full price might be a hard sell to those who weren't already sold on the trailer (which is still dare I say one of the best on the service), it'd almost be impossible to pick this up during a sale or bundle & not have a good time."

,Not Recommended,274270,15826800,"Posted: 14 May, 2015",all,Skunk,"NOT A HERO is another Retro style shooter that tries a bit too hard to be funny.I purchased NOT A HERO based on the release trailer, which I did find to be entertaining and humorous. I came in with high expectations. It showed very nice looking pixel style graphics, many unique characters, and exciting mission segments.Now, I've only played through the first series of levels, but I found myself bored and decided to take a break to write this review. The plot of NOT A HERO involves playing as different characters in order to assist Bunnylord in becoming Mayor. You will do this by assassinating certain people, destroying gang hideouts, and other forms of destroying crime by committing it.The Levels -As I mentioned before, I only played through the first section of levels. These first levels appeared extremely bland to me. Colors consisted of Red and Grey, and it didn't feel like I was ever changing levels after moving on. There are windows to jump through, and doors to open, but so far that is the only interaction I've discovered. I understand that there are secret areas, but I've yet to find any.I was surprised by the bland levels because the diner and office area are very detailed and attractive. I stopped playing when I got to the ""Green Levels,"" which I will call them. They looked almost exactly the same as the ""Red Levels."" Aside from a few different assets use for cover, which appeared to just be recolored.I will try to continue playing to see if the levels become more interesting, but so far, they are just boring.The Characters -I don't have a whole lot to say about the characters since I've only unlocked four of them.You've got the starter pistol guy, the woman that can run and shoot/reload, the country shotgun guy, and a.. colorful Jesus. I find these characters so far to be generic and uninspired. Just another attempt at humor that lacks creativity. They are varied skill-wise, and it's sometimes helpful to try a different one if you are struggling to complete all the bonus objectives in a level. I may add more to this after unlocking a few more.The main character in this game is Bunnylord. As I spoke of before, he is doing what he can to become mayor of the city. I found myself skipping most of his dialogue because it was so.. puerile.The humor in NOT A HERO had to have been written by a teenager. A teenager that just discovered balls and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes, and cursing without getting in trouble by his parents.Maybe that's the direction they were going for. I'm sure some people will find it funny.The Gameplay -It feels good with a controller. The controls are extremely basic. You could probably play this on an NES controller(not that this is a bad thing). It's fluid, smooth, and responsive, so I'll give it that. Unfortunately, the simple controls sometimes cause you to do one thing when trying to do another.Conclusion -I think that about covers it. Feel free to ask me any questions. I may provide some updates, or even change my opinion on recommendation, but I can't as of now.I like Devolver Digital. Broforce was funny, colorful, and fun. NOT A HERO is childish, bland, and boring.If you have the money, pick up Broforce instead of this one."

Whenever I beat a level I usually skipped most of the restaurant cutscene because I just wanted to play the next level. It was hard to listen to the jokes the game was throwing at me while I was hard-pressed trying not to get shot.-The gameplay was extremely frustrating to the point of being unfair, mostly due to the fact that I was trying to get Global Megalord on each level. I was experiencing a few cheap deaths and a a lot challenges were enraging to say the least. One checkpoint on each level would have made this more fun and less infuriating.- I found that either Mike is extremely overpowered, or the others are very underpowered. I was using Mike to beat most of the levels and I wanted a reason to use the other characters.- The game could get repetitive at times. Most of the side challenges were used on multiple occasions. The challenges were usually something like this: Collect this thing, get a kill streak, kill multiple people in a short amount of time, collect all of the power-ups, kill this dude, kill people using executions or critical hits, etc.- Little to no replayability once you get Global Megalord on each level.To summarize it:Great musicFrustrating, tough, rewarding gameplayMultiple charactersSarcastic and humorous storylineKinda repetitiveVery small amount of replayability.Above all, this game deserves way, WAY more attention.

Let's start with the love:- Doesn't take itself seriously at all- Cool yet simple art style/level design- satisfying enough variance between playable characters- satisfying, meaty violence- (genreally) smooth gameplayAnd now to the hate:- for a game that relies so heavily on twitch reflexes, it can be frightfully inconsistent. Enemies can become essentially unexecutable, either punching you away constantly when they didn't last time, or lying on the ground while you slide over them repeatedly. Control responsiveness can also be spotty, sometimes going into a room meaning to have guns blazing and you don't fire, or sending you flying through a window to an instakill.- plays jumprope with the line between a fun, challenging, rewarding experience and an outright cluster♥♥♥♥. This applies to both the amount of enemies you may enounter, and the challenges for any given level.- lack of checkpoints means the slightest mistake can result in a total reset."

,Recommended,274270,17702470,"Posted: 24 August, 2015",all,RadioactiveGazz,"I recommend this to people who get addicted to trying to puzzle their way through challenging pizelated violent scenarios. You know, Hotline Miami (which I'm sure pops up in these reviews a lot). It's got some fun voice acting, music, visuals and the gameplay is pretty solid, too. But often I couldn't tell if it wanted me to play fast or cautious. Neither seemed to 'fit', whereas a game that supports both options, I'd want both to feel right. When found a playstyle that worked, it was the one that boiled all the game's nuance to sliding at people and doing a ground takedown over and over again with the fastest guy. Now I feel like i'm playing the game right but I'm having a lot less fun. I am racking up all the objectives, though.The controls can bugger off. We have a million buttons on any modern controller, why is it the same button to run at an enemy AND jump into cover? These are opposite actions, and the game often confuses the two. Same goes for ground takedowns and just regular firing. It's infuriating in the wrong ways most of the time. When it's infuriating in the right ways is when it really shines, and that happens just often enough. Completing a level with all objectives is often rewarded, and the flow of levels seems pretty well thought out, too. I wish it would use these objectives to encourage changes in playstyle, but sticking to the fast guy is usually the way to go, once you have him.Also the writing is pants. They seem to have a wonderful handle on joke structure but not joke content. It's just random crap they thought up and giggled at, when they could have sat down for 10 more minutes and made something way funnier if they just put time and thought into it. and they even have art accompanying some of these jokes, which makes it seem even worse. If you're having someone animate a joke, put the effort into making it worth animating. There were times when jokes really landed, at least on a basic level, but it wasn't frequent. And their use of dark humour seemed unearned and uncomfortable. ""Look, we beat this guy to death"" isn't a joke. It's weak. The writing is what bothers me the most about this game.Anyway, this has been a fairly negative review, but it's far from a bad game. Just the ways it needs improvement seem basic, like they just needed to put more thought into it or another pair of eyes on it during production. It's a good game. I just really wish it could have been great."
,Recommended,274270,17687467,"Posted: 23 August, 2015",all,I Aten't Dead,"Not A Hero is an interesting game involving fever pitch combat mixed with nonsensical but on target humor where you do things that are fitting of the title.Basically, run through identical buildings with different layouts, shoot lots of baddies, be awesome, die a lot. Simple.Death comes fast (towards you and your foes) but most of the time the levels are short enough that a single death won't put you back too much. The longest of the 25 levels is about 4 or 5 minutes even if you're rushing through, and a lot of these happen towards the end of your heroic murderspree. Which is an aggrivating issue especially when you reach a point where some enemies can one hit kill you.That said, the game is very well balanced. Each of the nine playable characters are unique and have enough quirks between them to justify playing starter characters even in later levels. Each level of the game highlights what our cast can do well whether it be attack enemies from both sides, move fast, execute silently, or more. Of course the later characters are more powerful, though they end up surrendering the use of powerup equipment in the process (which honestly isn't too big of a loss).Not A Hero is a lot of fun to play from beginning to end, despite the aggrivation involving deaths. It's got some awesome varied voice acting too which helps with the constant dying thing. It is a twitch sidescolling shooter though so if you don't have the reflexes or the quick wit you best find something else as the game only gets faster. If you think you're up for the slaughter, then pick up this game whenever you feel like it - on sale or full retail. Hopefully there'll be a rad sequel."

There is a pattern on most missions: funny intro that overviews the situation at hand, disposal of pretty much every enemy you come across and fulfillment of a side objective such as rescuing hostages, plastering posters, collecting random stuff (truly random stuff if I may add!), etc.The game features a solid pixel styled appearance, an awesome chiptune soundtrack and some hillarious voicework. The characters at your disposal feature some variations in their gameplay mechanics so its easy to find someone that suits you best.

Make it more fun by representing BunnyLordTrying to get some people motivate for a event? Explain to them why BunnyLord would see this as a opporunity to improve mankind and be coolBeating up some sorry♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Yell it into his face so he knows why he is being beaten up.But really what is Not a HERO about?The totally rad BunnyLord came from the future to be elected mayor of your city because if he's not there will be like a totally unrad doom explosion and so in order to be elected BunnyLord and his Fun Club will eliminate all crime... by shooting it in it's ugly face.And so we come to the gameplay:Now Not a HERO is technically speaking a 2d “cover based” shooter but if you’re like me then it’s more like a run and melee/shotgun enemies down and before you know it, you’ve fell in love with Mike and are on a 30 Killstreak through a five story building and only 35 seconds into the mission.That sounds like a lot? It’s not really because most of the game is designed around the idea of constantly switching between always moving and using the cover mechanic to plan ahead. X is your slide which does two things, slide you into cover and knock enemies over. C is your fire button and if someone is knock over to assassinate them. Your V is for special weapons which can be found in the levels and the rest are your arrow keys. Quite simply mechanics, right? What ties it all together are the characters, which there are plenty of and different enough to be enjoyable. Mike, the one I mentioned earlier, for example has a shotgun and a machete. He is a fast character which can silently assassinate enemies and has a powerful shotgun, but it only has two shots and the reload is very long. So most of the time you will be tackling enemies left and right and just slicing through their necks like a extremely hot knife through warm butter… for BunnyLord’s election of course, not because you enjoy killing all these hopeless meatbags.So it’s a game with simplistic controls? Nothing new, there are plenty like that out there and the idea for the core gameplay isn’t neither. But most levels will force you to pick your battles. Sure you can just murder your way through a level, that’s easy, but completing the additional goals for extra glory to BunnyLord can be quite challenging. Even more you can’t complete all 3 additional task in separate runs of one level. It all needs to be done in one try which becomes especially hard if you’re asked to rush through a level in 30 seconds to find a ♥♥♥♥ing phone which is hidden somewhere in that ♥♥♥♥ing level and there are like 5 ♥♥♥♥ers which can’t be knock down for assassinating so you just have to ♥♥♥♥ing murder them and waste your ♥♥♥♥ing precious time… On the other hand the soundtrack really helped me let my rage flow into Mike and the vicious killing rampages I have. The 8bit style of music feels good and smooth and even after trying a level several times doesn’t become annoying.To sum it all up: Not a HERO is a fast paced game about a time traveling bunny who wants to become the mayor and gets a bunch of assassin to do his campaigning. The gameplay, art style and soundtrack fit wonderfully together, they are lots of milkshakes in it and it’s even political.And really what is a little bit of violence for a better tomorrow?"

It seems that every charming pixelated game has to be a roguelike with absolutely insane difficulty, like we're all collectively competing to make the hardest game possible.NOT A HERO alleviates that problem somewhat, creating a rather casual but fast-paced little retro shoot-em-up that's very fun and easy if you just wanna shoot to the end. But much more challenge lies in the bonus objectives, which increase your score and allow you to attain higher ranks.There's also quite a lot of diversity in the character classes, and I rather enjoy the sense of humor the game has.

Not a hero misses well balanced mechanics like those games, for an example in-level objectives and puzzle elements like in gunpoint, or the way you can create your own paths in BroForce by shooting your way through.So for now, it's a thumbs down, despite the game actually look great, nice sound and funny story line, which may be the only reason i may revisit it sometime in the future."

The music is also complete madness. I get crazy over good chiptune Nintendo-type melodies, and this game has some awesome tunes.The characters in this game present unique challenges as they do have differing attributes and disadvantages. Characters like Jesus are speedy so he can complete the speed challenges, but his health goes down quicker so more damaging enemies will make quick work of him. Others can have more damage at the expense of slower reload rates and speed to evade attacks. Stealth is also needed in missions where you have to save hostages as up-front confrontation is impossible.Gameplay is frenetic and it gets real hard as you progress but it is so fun, that it could be something to just shrug off and continue.Overall, if you are into challenging games, fanatic about gore, and crazy about retro graphics, buy this game.

The action is great and so is the humor. It keeps track of various stats for each level and the things that Bunnylord tells you are determined by a sort of Mad Libs system, so you have multiple reasons to replay levels.My objections are few, but I think that the player can come to terms with them and still find the game to be incredibly enjoyable. Objection #1 is that the 3 out of 4 secret levels (the 4th secret level is meant to be a joke that's next to impossible NOT to beat) that the game keeps stats for are not acknowledged in the order that they are discovered in. To elaborate, each of the 3 districts has 1 secret level that you can view stats for, but the 1st district's secret level stats are shown as ""SECRET 3"", the 2nd district's secret level stats are shown as ""SECRET 1"" and the 3rd district's secret level stats are shown as ""SECRET 2"". Objection #2 is that it seems that each character that you can play as will not necessarily be able to complete all 3 extra objectives for certain levels. Objection #3 is that it can be very difficult to understand the spoken dialogue due to the thick British accents and terminology. The 4th and final objection is that Xbox One will be getting a Super Snazzy Edition of this game with 3 extra levels where you can play as Bunnylord, but it doesn't seem like they'll be offering the same courtesy to PC users.As I said, I believe that once you come to terms with these objections, then you can truly enjoy this game. Do I recommend this game? Well, I see no ""Hell, yeah!"" button to press, so I'm going to have to settle for ""Yes"". You'll feel like a badass as you off bad guys and then laugh that newly-acquired badass off at its humor. This game deserves an entire friggin' FRANCHISE! Spread the awesome word of Bunnylord!"

,Recommended,274270,26305635,"Posted: 29 October, 2016",all,TigerTrix,"I loved this game.  It controls very well (using a xbox360 gamepad), runs easily in full screen (alt+enter), and plays differently with different characters that you unlock as you do better, and can suit your play style.  I personally prefer the guy with the shotgun.  You can slide into cover, shoot, reload, knock down guys and assasinate.  It is easy enough to just get through, but challenging to make the 3 extra goals on each mission, and really challenging to get tops marks on all (megalord rank).  I usually missed the time-based ones, but there aren't too many time-based ones, so I ended with more than half at megalord level, and rest at king level.A few of the optional time-based goals were too challenging for me, but others were tough but doable, such as ones that you only had to reach the payphone in time.  But the final level was quite challenging.  I ended up having to change characters to one that worked better on the final level, and then finally beat it.  It is heart-wrenching to die after passing the initial boss fight portion, but you learn from your mistakes.I would love to see more games like this."

Levels are simple and pretty straightforward, but clever in some ways, especially once you figure out how to get all the little collectibles or whatever. (Is that the right word?)I bought it for the humor, and I must say it's actually not as funny as it seems like it'd be. They basically just use big ol' words and strap way too many adjectives to them. Like, that's the humor of it. Sure, you are campaigning for a ♥♥♥♥ing rabbit--cute, I'll give it that--but I seriously got to the point where I was skipping dialogue to avoid getting a bad taste in my mouth... In no way is this as brilliant as Broforce, but that's my opinion.Look, if you're gonna buy it, buy it to ♥♥♥♥ around with for a few hours and then dump. NO, I didn't finish it, but given that there's a massive difficulty spike at the end and I'd already experienced the core of the game, I have no regrets.(P.S. I recommend waiting for a sale, honestly.)EDIT: People are saying this is like Hotline Miami... It's not. Where Hotline Miami had serious tension, endless replayability, genius level design, and thoughtful commentary on the industry, this game involves using two buttons on a single plane with no hidden meanings in the story whatsoever. I'm sorry, it sounds like I'm bashing it--but don't go into it thinking it'll be like Hotline Miami. Unless all you liked about HM was the pretty colors."

I liked the combat but the over-the-top difficulty made the game incredibly frustrating and forced me to rage quit several times.But...I always came back after a few days. I call it The Dark Souls Effect: Yes, the game is incredibly hard but not impossible and when you finally succeed it feels very rewarding. And the combat itself is entertaining enough to keep me in.So I tried and tried and tried... and got better. I learned to do the executions properly, I discovered enemy powers and weaknesses, I started counting ammo in my head instead of always looking on the counter. And here I am now, all chalenges completed, global megalord status achieved.So yes, I recommend the game but be prepared. And patient.Update 9/28: The GLOBAL MEGALORD EDITION added three more levels which ramp up the difficulty to the point where I can't be bothered anymore. Especially the third level. This is no longer about skill, it's just about dozens and dozens and DOZENS of attempts, running through enemies, hoping to dodge bullets and to avoid the brutal time limit represented by The Killinator. Replay a hundred times until you finally get lucky.Also a few impossible achievements were added, destroying my 100% completion. ♥♥♥♥ this game."

Do you need a pick me up? Well have I got the game for your! Not a Hero is a 16 bit game 2D side scrolling game where you bust open door, climb to the top of roofs, and jump off those roofs minutes later. The story is something named Bunny Lord wants to be major of London, and Bunny Lord wants you to help. You don't help Bunny Lord by preparing silly things like speeches or fliers. No the way you help Bunny Lord is by curb stomping crime literally. Whether is be the archetypal Russian mob enemies, gangsters or Yakuza in each of their own themed levels and cities. Of course not before your fearless leader gives you a sarcastic filled and quite graphic briefing on what you have to do and how to do it. After which if you survive you get to have coffee and pancakes, but before you have said delicious goodness you have to do said curb stomping.  You achieve this go by playing one of the many archetypal character to go along with the enemies in this game. From the hillbilly with a shotgun to the very sexual Latino man who just can't stop thrusting his hips. Each character has their own play style and weapons that match their archetypes. You start out with only one character but you guessed it the more curb stomping you do the more you can recruit. It's also how you get 100% if you didn't guess already. So join the Bunny Lord Campaign Club or prepared to get curb stomped."

If you die, it's ALWAYS YOUR FAULT. I initially thought that only 9 playable characters wasn't much, but with all of their traits put together, it doesn't feel boring. The enemies are also widely varied, and attack you in different ways. One common theme i noticed with the enemies is: If they are blue STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THEM AS POSSIBLE. The gore is very.....colourful too.My favourite quality of this game is the character dialog, particularly when playing a mission. This is where the characters' personalities shine. Most of the time they're yelling swear words at the enemies as they pulverize them, but at some points, one of the characters just yells ""YOUR MUM!"", so that can be entertaining. Bunnylord's dialog is also quite entertaing. The words he says changes every time you play a mission again, so you don't get bored of what he says (opinions may vary).The game has only 21 levels, and I feel like there could have been many more. They are structured well though, split into 7 day sections, where you attack different types of enemies in different types of buildings, and on the seventh day of each week, you fight a crime boss. (There are 4 secret levels, if you can find them.) I feel like custom maps and workshop support would be an excellent addition to the game, and I feel like I'm not the first person to think this.I rate this game:Edgy/10"
