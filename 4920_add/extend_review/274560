,Not Recommended,274560,16952192,"Posted: 8 July, 2015",all,Sheep!,"Revolution Ace was an interesting attempt to build a shmup in the Unreal Engine, which was not at all designed for the purpose.  The resulting game isn't a disaster, but neither is it a compelling success.The appeal of shmup games typically comes from hectic action; your weapons are typically devastating, killing the weakest foes in one hit, and your fire rate is intense.  Challenge in a shmup typically comes not from any deficiency of your avatar, but the sheer numbers of enemies it sends at you, the intensity of their fire, and the speed at which they move.Revolution Ace departs radically from that standard shmup formula.  You and the majority of your foes move slowly, even sluggishly.  Your weapons are uncharacteristically weak, requiring a good second or so of concentrated fire to take down most normal opponents, who are comparatively few in number.  Instead of a hyperkinetic frenzy of ducking and weaving through enemy fire while opponents explode in dramatic fireballs all around you, Revolution Ace feels more like a slow, stubborn push through the enemy forces, hoping to make it through to the final boss before your armor is depleted.The addition of true 3D modeling, switchable air/ground fire and recharging shield to the genre are interesting, but don't really make up for the loss of the speed and destructiveness that is the hallmark of this style of gameplay."

Music lags constantly in all the menus, sound design is mediocre at best, and it all requires an old version of nVidia PhysX just to run (builldings falling into pieces? planes dropping out of the sky? we could do without it at no gaming experience lost).All in all, a disappointment.

,Recommended,274560,20454877,"Posted: 10 January, 2016",all,somebody336,"Revolution Ace is a top down Shmup in where you fight enemies from both the air and the ground simultaneously. There are two keys that fires your weapons. One is to aim your projectiles in front of you and the other to fire at the ground below you. It can be confusing to tell on what plane an enemy is on and I would often times find myself shooting over an enemy. After a bit of practice and knowledge of the enemy it becomes a non-issue. Before getting to the gameplay you may want to tweak around with the graphic settings but be warned, turning on CSAA anti-aliasing will immediately crash the game for some reason. There are four modes in this title. Campaign provides a story and unlocks more levels for the other modes, Skirmish is to replay any mission you want and even some exclusive ones and versus has you and another player going through the same mission competing for score while introducing some new power-ups that hinders your opponent.The last mode is called BattleChain that works similarly to versus though you play alone and later send the ghost data of your playthrough to the person you challenge. Campaign mode is where you'll want to start as it does it's best to introduce you to the mechanics of this game. The story of Revolution Ace has an interesting beginning in which the nations of the world built machines to fight their wars instead of wasting any human lives and the robots eventually stop fighting each other to launch a devastating attack against humanity. It has a very interesting premise but goes nowhere as they went for the “funny redneck” vaguely explains what you are doing on each mission route. No one expects a story from a Shmup though it did feel rather disappointing to start off with one and promptly forget about it. Throughout every mission you will be facing a horde of hostile robots in your cheap cobbled together jet in a last ditch attempt to retaliate against the enemy. It starts off as a suicide mission though after many successes you start gathering scrap that allows you to build much better equipment on your craft.The more enemies you destroy the more scrap you collect once successfully completing a mission. You get much more scrap if you kill an enemy before it leaves the screen. If it leaves and comes back for a second barrage it will be worth far less. Scrap will be the most important thing in this game since Revolution Ace features RPG like progression in where newer unlocked weapons you can buy in the armory are better in every way compared to your meager starting equipment. You also level up by gaining experience and unlike scraps you still get experience even if you fail the mission. Leveling up sometimes means that you get to choose from one of many perks that increase damage for a certain weapon type, allows your shields to recharge faster and one that increases your overall health to name a few. Sometimes instead of being able to choose from perks while leveling up you will instead have new equipment available to buy in the Armory. You will be needing all the help you can get as this game is brutal and I barely managed to beat it even while playing through the entire game with someone else.This would be a good time to mention the online multiplayer. It is great and I couldn't notice any lag or hiccups during 6 or so hours of playtime on two very poor internet connections. I wish more shumps would include online play as most have the option for two players but many of us can't take advantage of it. Funny that a 2 dollar game should include it and it's a feature I must applaud. This is one of the most graphically impressive shmups on the market as it runs on Unreal Engine 3 and features cool effects such as the water rippling when shot at as well as fancy explosions. It is a very nice looking game but there is nothing interesting to look at as most of the game is either in a bland desert, the sky or over water. Enemy designs are decent though this is where the game suffers the most due to the RPG system of this game. From start to finish the enemies felt very bullet spongy making the combat feel unsatisfying and utterly devoid of any flow as you spend way too much time on a single enemy while there are dozens more coming for you.That makes it feel like a game designed around grinding instead of skill. It is possible to beat the game without any grinding, however bullet spongy enemies make it tedious task. Leveling up also unlocks weapon slots for your ship allowing you to place a few more guns on the side of it to shoot horizontally. You unlock the left weapon slot first and it takes quite a while to unlock the one on the right side making it feel like very artificial progression. We are the last hope to destroy the robot menace and the mechanic won't install another gun on your preferred side of the ship because we are not level 18? The RPG features of this game aren't subjectively bad as those that like the feeling of becoming more powerful and being able to take on more difficult tasks are sure to enjoy it but for those of us that prefer Shmups to have everything we need to stand a chance from the get go and skill being the determining factor in whether we are victorious or a pile of debris on the floor.Weapons variants range from bullets, lasers and explosives. Each unlocked weapon has different effects even if they are the same variant so make sure to carefully read the description as some weapons can't be shoot at ground enemies. Fighting ground enemies is kind of clunky as you have some type of auto lock feature while shooting at the ground so you may fire at the wrong target from time to time. It is very cool seeing a buggy riding around down in a desert shooting up at you and those add some strategy to game as you decide whether to fight the enemies in front of you or the ones below you. The projectiles on screen are shot by the dozens and is near bullet hell levels of crazy. Unlike Bullet Hells your ship's hitbox is pretty huge here and you can take quite a bit of punishment before meeting your demise. You have both a shield and hull health to protect you from exploding. It doesn't matter much if the shield takes damage as not firing your weapons will recharge its energy back, hull health on the other hand you do not want to take any damage to . The only way to heal hull health is via a semi-rare powerup that enemies drop and if your shields are completely down that means things have gone really wrong.Shields can also be bought and replaced with different types such as ones that take more damage but recharge slower. The whole not shooting to recharge your shields gimmick is rather weird and will more often than not cause you to get overwhelmed as more enemies enter the fray. It makes for some rather intense moments where you have a split second to decide if you stop firing and try to hold out until some of your shield is recharged or to hold your ground and risk it all. These moments would be a lot more fun if the enemies weren't so bullet spongy and you could go out in a blaze of glory though there is no denying it will still have you on the edge of your seat. One complaint I have regarding projectiles is that some enemies shoot dark brown projectiles that are really hard to see in most cases. There is also this weird gimmick in where your ship randomly rises higher to the sky or lower in certain set points of the level. Bosses are giant enemies be they fortresses or battleships that will do everything it can to shoot you down. It is rather cool seeing them get desperate as their health is low and launching an all-out barrage of projectiles. In the end of the day this is a content packed shmup with online coop, some levels in Skrimish mode that randomly generate the game and many handmade missions to blast your way through. It is by no means a game that will take the world by storm but for its low price this is a game that any fan of the Shmups should at least take a look at."

,Recommended,274560,26619445,"Posted: 15 November, 2016",all,mynameismonkey,"Later on, mankind uses AI driven machines to wage war, yet this invert releases when the machines turn on their masters. To fight this risk, your top of the line pilot takes to the sky in an old travel to counter. The machines are summoning the land, sea and air so your battle won't be straightforward.At first I felt that Change Expert didn't much issue with a story as the elucidation for why you are controlling an old stream against bleeding edge foes is simply revealed several levels into the beguilement. It doesn't have any kind of effect nonetheless, as no reason is relied upon to partake in some old school, level shooting movement. Disregarding the Shocking Engine controlled visuals, Change Master seems like it was detached straight from a nineties arcade machine. Unmistakably time has been spent on making the ground look fascinating with effects like trees affecting in the wind and mountains that climb up into the screen however the general effect is somewhat frustrating. It could just be my own slants, however the sensible style visuals essentially look a touch too much troubling for an over the top style entertainment like Bombshell Expert.I can't accuse the contrasting qualities in any case, as the delight takes you transversely over unsettled areas, mountains and oceans, with a couple levels shrouded in haze or solicited in snow. There are irrefutably minutes where the diversion benefits look and there is emphatically no nonattendance of enemies to shoot at, yet there is nothing that really isolates the visuals from the pack.Change Master is a genuinely coordinate shooter, yet there are a few novel things that make it worth a minute look. Firstly, enemies attack from both the air and ground and you use two separate fire gets to attract them. Weaving through shots while shooting on the right plane can be questionable at in any case, yet it soon ends up being second nature. Completing levels compensate you with experience centers and shrapnel. Experience centers are tallied up to fabricate the level of your fly, which prompts to prizes, for instance, more weapon spaces, new weapons and a liven of your choice. The preferences keep running from better covering to speedier slugs or strong laser and there are lacking levels to pick each one of them so you have to pick carefully. The shrapnel is your cash and is used to purchase the programmed rifles, rockets and bar firearms and moreover shields and exceptional strikes that make your specialty so significant. There are more than 20 weapons to peruse and the position on your fly matters which makes it diverting to mix and match to see what the results are.The campaign mode felt to some degree longer than what you generally find in the class and upon fulfillment you can start a harder, New+ playthrough. There are similarly three inconvenience settings to give everyone a sensible shot at beating the entertainment. Enemies attack in substantial numbers and on Run of the mill or higher, the ones that you miss returns for another go, however the way that you have a shield and protective layer meter makes things stunningly less requesting. Shooters with one hit executes can perplex, so Uprising Master is a conventional introduction to the class that won't drive off newcomers.If you understand blazed on the fight mode or feel like you need some extra experience and shrapnel you can explore different avenues regarding the Engagement mode. In Struggle you find the opportunity to pick a level from any of the ones that you have viably opened to practice or farm experience and shrapnel. Fundamentally more fun is the Versus mode where you play one beside the other with another player and can mess up their entertainment by sending enemies to their side of the screen. The Battle Chains mode works the same as Versus however rather than playing against some individual dynamically you challenge their recordings. If you complete the test you can send it back to the principal player who then need to fight with all the extra tumult that you brought on in the midst of your playthrough. The test increment quickly and this mode can end up being exceptionally addictive, however finding diverse players is not that basic right at this point.I had a lot of fun with Change Master however this may be a result of me playing shooters since the start of the arcades. More up and coming players might be less thoughtful about the dull visuals and rather non particular sound. The controls regardless, are responsive and the preoccupation most likely packs a test, however isolated from the versus modes it doesn't by and large rise up out of the pack. I really favored the thought so in a perfect world LGG can make a turn off, which genuinely increment the era values.(All overviews are recuperated from the Internet and channeled through a movement of equal word gadgets three times both for unreasonableness and to extra time.

Unfortunately, other than being in HD, it's basically worse in every way.The graphics may be in HD, but they're not nearly as well-drawn, and I frequently found myself losing track of enemy bullets against the background. The Raptor-esque ship customization is mostly retained, but weapons generally are limited to either air or ground targets, and don't lose much power when you take the ones which can hit both - to me, this meant that the four or so weapons that could hit both air and ground targets were the only choices, since otherwise I'd be leaving tons of damage on the table against some or all targets.I didn't really end up with much else to say. It wasn't a terrible effort, and the core mechanics work well enough, but ultimately it was just a knockoff that I didn't feel had anything to really say for itself or any reason that you should play it.

You have ""scrap"" (money for shop), experience points for leveling up your rank (which opens more weapon slots), and perks.The levels move slow and it may seem like a walk in the park towards the beginning, but don't let that fool you since you can find yourself easily overwhelmed all of a sudden. It's not a ""bullet hell game"" since there aren't 1000 bullets on the screen, but that doesn't mean you won't run into a bullet infested screen. This is definitely apparent in the later levels. The level of challenge is perfect with this one. It's not too easy and it's not too hard to make you stop playing altogether.Besides it having campaign co-op, you can split-screen battle a friend to see who ends up with the higher score. There are a few power-ups specific that appear in this mode which will affect the other player. It can either be positive or negative so that you don't just grab every one you see.You have one life to beat a level, but you have two lifebars.

To combat this threat, your elite pilot takes to the sky in an old jet to retaliate. The machines are dominating the land, sea and air so your battle will not be easy.At first I thought that Revolution Ace didn’t even bother with a story as the explanation for why you are piloting an old jet against futuristic foes is only revealed a few levels into the game. It doesn’t matter though, as no excuse is needed to engage in some old school, horizontal shooting action. Despite the Unreal Engine powered visuals, Revolution Ace looks like it was ripped straight out of a nineties arcade machine. It is clear that time has been spent on making the ground look interesting with effects like trees swaying in the wind and mountains that rise up into the screen but the overall effect is a bit underwhelming. It could just be my personal preferences, but the realistic style visuals just look a tad too drab for an over the top style game like Revolution Ace.I can’t fault the diversity though, as the game takes you across jungles, mountains and oceans, with some levels shrouded in mist or covered in snow. There are definitely moments where the game does look good and there is certainly no lack of enemies to shoot at, but there is nothing that really sets the visuals apart from the pack.Revolution Ace is a pretty straightforward shooter, but there are a couple of unique things that make it worth a second look. Firstly, enemies attack from both the air and ground and you use two separate fire buttons to engage them. Weaving through bullets while shooting on the correct plane can be tricky at first, but it soon becomes second nature. Completing levels reward you with experience points and shrapnel. Experience points are tallied up to increase the level of your jet, which leads to rewards such as more weapon slots, new weapons and a perk of your choice. The perks range from better armor to faster bullets or strong laser and there are not enough levels to choose all of them so you have to pick carefully. The shrapnel is your currency and is used to purchase the machine guns, missiles and beam cannons as well as shields and special attacks that make your craft so formidable. There are more than 20 weapons to choose from and the placement on your jet matters which makes it fun to mix and match to see what the results are.The campaign mode felt a bit longer than what you usually find in the genre and upon completion you can start a tougher, New+ playthrough. There are also three difficulty settings to give everyone a fair chance at beating the game. Enemies attack in droves and on Normal or higher, the ones that you miss comes back for another go, but the fact that you have a shield and armor meter makes things considerably easier. Shooters with one hit kills can be frustrating, so Revolution Ace is a nice introduction to the genre that won’t scare away newcomers.If you tire of the campaign mode or feel like you need some extra experience and shrapnel you can try out the Skirmish mode. In Skirmish you get to pick a level from any of the ones that you have already unlocked to practice or farm experience and shrapnel. Much more fun is the Versus mode where you play side by side with another player and can mess up their game by sending enemies to their side of the screen. The Battle Chains mode works the same as Versus but instead of playing against someone in real-time you challenge their recordings. If you complete the challenge you can send it back to the original player who then have to contend with all the added mayhem that you caused during your playthrough. The challenge ramps up quickly and this mode can become quite addictive, but finding other players is not that easy at the moment.I had a lot of fun with Revolution Ace but this may be due to me playing shooters since the early days of the arcades. Newer players might be less forgiving about the bland visuals and rather generic audio. The controls however, are responsive and the game certainly packs a challenge, but apart from the versus modes it doesn’t really stand out from the pack. I really liked the concept so hopefully LGG can create a sequel, which really ramps up the production values."

The regularly upgrading item shop will keep you changing out and trying new equipment each level. The sheild system is one of the best Ive seen in this type of game. It also sports a cool perk system which allows you to further customize the experience.While the technical and paper design is fairly strong, where the game falls short is the execution. The UI is challenging and you will more than likely accidentaly purchase a weapon twice or salvage something you want before fully understanding  the shop/equip menu. The art is quite bad overall with uninspiring visual designs in enemies, VFX and environment.There are a few really good boss encounters and some of the enemy patterns keep the gameplay feeling somewhat unique throughout.  The majority of the regular enemies and the bulk of levels are fairly bland and the pacing feels flat. There are very few highs and lows which makes the game start to feel boring too quickly.  Ground enemies shoot up at you and its very unclear when you will get hit so it can feel cheap at certain points.Overall: Good design + Mediocre gameplay execution + Bellow par visuals.

During combat, ground and air targets must be targeted separately, forcing the player to assess which targets pose the highest threat and adding some strategy to what boils down to just holding the fire button in other similar games. There are also a few different multiplayer modes to choose from. Unfortunately, not many people play, so your best bet would be to find a buddy to play with. I didn't particularly enjoy replaying the game three times to get all of the achievements, but it wasn't boring either, with each consecutive playthrough getting tougher than the last.

Instead of this, you have the not very handsome shopkeeper looking at you.Inicial firepower is ridiculous. Enemies gather on screen even on later stages.Hastwo separate buttons for air and ground shotting. This is the worst idea ever! At minimum firepower it becomes frustrating: you shoot at the ground, air enemies get you; you shot at the air, ground enemies overflow you with bullets. There are even some bosses which can only be hit by ground weapons, which have usually the less damage.Game probably expects you to grind money for weapons.Enemies and scenaries seem to repeat themselves instead of being separated by theme or appearance. The result is monotonous levels, all of them very alike.Bullet patterns from enemies and bosses do not seem to be very polished. There are moments where you will simply take damage whatever you do.Enemy waves do not seem to have a lot of thought behind them. They seem random and sometimes they stay on screen until they are destroyed, whith at early levels can create an extremely tough situation.Sometimes the game zooms in and you have less space to dodge bullets with no apparent reason. Also, when the screen turns ninety degrees it doesn't look very dinamic or game-like.Your ship is not very pretty.Story is just some scattered paragraphs.Yes, this game is cheap.

My favourite genre is twin stick shoot-em-up`s. Having watched some video of this game in action, I decided to take the plunge, was it worth it?My God, yes it was. This game contains everything I love about the genre. Masses of different enemies, many many weapons to unlock and equip, colurdul, detailed levels, and so much more.....  I think the Devs were trying to recreate the shooters from the old school, and they succeeded, and them some. The love and attention that has gone into this game shines through, and it makes playing the game even more pleasurable.One of the best features is the multi-player aspect, of sorts. If you get a good score on a level, you can decide to upload that level to the online leaderboards. It then becomes a challenge, and anyone who sees it, can have a go at beating your time/score. If they manage to do this, they can the re-upload the challenge, and send it back to you. I have been having a challenge with another guy for about 10 days now. It is so satisfying to beat their score, and send the challenge back to them.In closing, if you are in ANY WAY interested in this type of game, you really cannot go wrong.

It's not the good-looking kind of realistic, which annoyed me when I played the game since I couldn't clearly see the enemy's projectiles. In a game where I am supposed to dodge and shoot everyone up, not being able to clearly see (so you can dodge the projectile) defeats the purpose of the game. I ended up not giving the game much of a chance after the first few minutes of gameplay since I kept getting frustrated with the graphics. I did not want to attempt even harder levels where there are more enemies than the first level with these graphics.Overall, the game might have potential to be played.

But there's a TON of grinding ahead of this task and a recently implemented feature - perk resetting - although great, takes away one whole level from you so the grind is even worse if you don't plan your perks carefully and have to reset them.Battle Chains mode is clunky. The game often crashes while I'm creating a new BC match. If I am lucky enough to finish it and choose ""upload it globally"", I don't keep it local to replay and it never appears in the ""sent by me"" tab. (They just updated battle chains, removing some broken ones and changing settings so more battles will be available for more people, so maybe a few of these complaints are solved by now);Colored bullets - both yours and the enemies' - make it hard to know what is yours and what is theirs (in other words, what should you be avoiding and what you can pass through). a fixed color that's only used in your bullets would be a great addition.OVERALL: I finished the campaign 3 times (normal, +1 and +2) and got all achievements but have no patience to grind my level up to unlock all perks. As a completionist, it bothers me. Battle Chains is a nice idea but had a flawed execution, I hope they keep improving it.I stand in a neutral(ish) 3.5 / 5.

Unfortunately Revolution Ace is nowhere near as good as Raptor. It does have a number of decent ideas, but none of them are particularly well implemented.The game goes for a kind of realistic art style (at least with the terrain) and this feels like a terrible choice. The backgrounds look extremely ugly and way too often the enemies and the bullets blend in the terrain. And good luck telling the air and ground targets apart when many of the ground units actually hover in the air too!The audio isn't particularly impressive either. The sound effects feel quite weak and the soundtrack is rather repetitive as well. The weapons feel extremely weak too and even early enemies can take a massive amount of punishment before finally dying.The ability to recharge your shields by not firing sounds like a good idea at first, but in practice it just leads to tedious gameplay where you take a break from the actual fighting and spend some time simply dodging bullets. The split between air and ground weapons is not particularly well done either and often ends up being more frustrating than anything else.Overall I didn't find Revolution Ace particularly enjoyable and I gave up after playing for a bit over an hour. I wouldn't recommended it as there are far better shoot 'em ups available on Steam.The good:- Some nice ideas (even if they are not particularly well implemented)The bad:- Terrible graphics- Poor audio- Ground/air weapon split is poorly done- Weapons feel extremely weak- Enemy waves and bullet patterns are not very interesting- Poorly designed perk system- Terrible story and writing"

Not too challenging as bullet hell style games go, but hard enough to keep you coming back to master the enemy patterns. Good variety of weapons upgrades and perks that allow you to customize your playstyle, and to provide impetus to keep gaining XP and scrap (the game's currency.)New Game Plus modes exist (I've beaten it twice now, so I'm up to +2... not certain if there's another tier beyond those or not) and do provide a stiffer challenge, with more, toughter, more well equiped enemies. And beaten levels, along with a smattering of unique courses, can be replayed in Skirmish mode with persistent XP and scrap across both it and the campaign mode.There's online play too, but I don't get into that personally so it's beyond the scope of this review.Fantastic game for the price.

The game also crashes rather unexpectedly for no apparant reason.  During certain missions, if you're not host, enemies may be entirely invisible.  Also as you hit higher levels it becomes a grind fest to get the scrap and experience to keep steadily progressing.  Nor do you get a reward for every level up which is a relatively minor complaint.  The most glaring problems are the multiplayer and I think with work it will be great.  If you get this game, don't expect to be playing it with friends.  It is a great time waster to play by yourself however.  The weapons don't feel imbalanced and the enemies don't really feel cheap or overpowered."

,Recommended,274560,18135653,"Posted: 21 September, 2015",all,pepsimanvsjoe,"In this 2D shooter, you're tasked with saving the-- ah screw it. There is a storyline but I don't care about it and neither should you. Basically you're destroying enemies, collecting cash, upgrading your arsenal, and repeating until boredom sets in. One of the other reviews on this page compares it to Tyrian...or was it Tyrian 2000? It might have been Raptor: Call of Shadows for all I can remember.Anyway, this isn't a difficult game to process. The challenge is in finding the weapons that suit your style of play. Everything else is fundamentals (dodge bullets). There are a large number of stages, but most of them play out the same way. There are numerous enemies, each with their own pattern and method of attack. Through any number of combinations, their aim is to destroy you. While campaign levels are structured in a manner similar to classic overhead shooters of the 80s, there are an assortment of random levels where anything can happen. All in all, this shooter doesn't give off a hand-crafted and thoroughly polished vibe. It's not like the average game by Cave* which has 5 stages that are  meticulous in their design and execution. This game has a lot of stages, and the common theme is ""We have tanks, ships, and turrets, let's cram them wherever.""Couple this lazy level-design with poor mechanics (the hit-box is too big), bullets that can blend in with the scenery, and the result is something that I should hate.But I dont.What?Yeah I know, I'm a guy with a Cave avatar, I should be a bit more particular about the shmups that I enjoy.But I have to admit that I like this game.To me at least, the most compelling aspect for some games is experimentation. One of my favorite games of all time is Guardian Heroes, and most of the time I just play Versus mode. GH is a fighter/beatemup with a hugely unbalanced cast of characters. When I throw them all into the arena, the results can be interesting. Additional variables such as the experience level (which affects stats) further change how things play out. A lot of that game is spent just playing with ideas. It's a fun game on its own, but the creative aspects give it a lot of dimension.Revolution Ace has this same characteristic in not just its weapon system, but also in the random stages. Numerous enemies and boss combinations can appear, which can result in a number of unique situations. Furthermore, by progressing through the campaign, the difficulty can be increased (through a +1, +2, etc system). Sometimes the results are really unfortunate. I recall one level where the boss appeared, but then the field did a 90 degree turn. So instead of the boss being in front of me, he was to the side, and I didn't really have the weapons to reach him at that angle.The Battle Chain mode is interesting. This is an indirect-competitive mode. What you do is play through a stage, upload your score, and then another player can opt to challenge that score. Now what makes this mode interesting is that all of the combos and power-ups you grab, can have an affect on the opposition. Larger combos can spawn more enemies, power-ups can add more dangers, etc. If the opposing player succeeds in beating your score, then you can challenge the new hi-score, and so on, and so on. You can even save your replays locally, and play against yourself. It's a really neat idea, but to get the most out of it requires strong weapons**. Getting strong weapons requires some grinding.The grinding aspect is most likely going to turn away some players. There are some compelling aspects to Revolution Ace, but they require an investment of time. Usually with 2D shooters we're given a game that takes 30 minutes to ""complete"" but a great many hours to beat without continuing, dying, and/or getting the highest possible score. With this game however, the campaign is much longer, there are numerous optional stages, and most of the hours are spent leveling up and affording the best gear. For some gamers the grind is compelling in itself, but for others, they'll want to get the kind of experience that can't be measured in raw numbers. That's not to mention that on its own, Revolution Ace is a poor 2D shooter. It has a lot of flaws that would sink other games, and yet I think it's fascinating.But that's just me.*I hope I don't get tired of mentioning Cave by the time Mushihime-sama comes out.**And players too, can't forget them."

What we have here is quite the contrary indeed.While the use of Unreal engine on a shoot them up might have been a weird choice, the action in itself is slick and fanciful, there wasn’t a moment where I felt put off by the graphics. The implementation of a physics system meant you can see you enemies explode in a multitude of ways as well, with debris causing ripples across the sea or scraps rolling down the hill.That said, the game did suffer from some pacing problems with awkward windows where nothing spawned screen for ages, ruining your combo. The boss designs also suffered from a lack of creativity too, with a few so mundane that made the battle felt underwhelming.The most noteworthy feature is the lengthy campaign, which has 18 stages in total spanning 4 to 8 minutes each. If that wasn’t enough to justify purchase, there are also procedurally generated challenges made with seeds, along with two multi-player modes. So if you aren’t completely sold upon first glance, you can always count on replay value instead.All that aside, you can definitely do a lot worse with 2 bucks on Steam, so there’s no reason not to give this title a try."

I've played for 2 hours and my weapons were just as useless as when i started despite numerous ""upgrades"".Also if you like playing this kind of game with a mouse, forget it; the sensitivity is way too low even on its maximum setting.There are a lot of dopey design decisions, chiefly:Power-up's having a delay between their appearance and their availability.Enemy ship types which are impossible to destroy on their first pass without you taking more damage than them.In-game power-up's which don't last long enough to be of any use.Super-weapons which are either ineffective or take so long to recharge that you only get to use them once per level.Ship and weapon upgrades that don't appear to make your foes any easier to kill or your ship any harder to damage.Level-up 'perks' which are so ineffective that one questions their inclusion in the game.There is an auto shield-recharge but by the time the game has realised that you're not shooting anymore, the screen has filled up again.And occasionally the game crashes on exit and prevents you returning to desktop.What's good about it?Some of the music is cool and I like the 3-dimensional landscape.Overall Revolution Ace is more frustrating than is really necessary. With so many excellent shooters available, there really is no room for this title; at least not for money.--**2017 replay and update**I decided to give the game another chance when older and wiser, and after numerous patches. And i can honestly say hand on heart....That it's even worse than i remember it being.The grinding is as annoying and pointless as ever, you have to retry a level multiple times in order to level up, and even when you do the improvement to your firepower is non-existant. So you'll keep getting killed by the same types of enemies over and over, gritting your teeth through the unimaginative and repetitive music. You'll also be irritated that the powerups last about a third of the time they'd need to; to be of any use, and with the exception of the ghost ally they don't appear to do anything anyway. All the weapon addons are worse than the guns you start with and cost way too much compared to the amount you earn for finally beating a level after 12 attempts.I was far too neutral in my original review. Life is too short to bother with crap like this and there are several shooters available on Steam which are actually good. No fun to be had in Revolution Ace, move along."

,Recommended,274560,22969074,"Posted: 13 May, 2016",all,Jedzenie,"Okay wow this is an unexpectedly good game. Bought it randomly for $0.25 (ironically like inserting a single quarter into an old timey arcade machine).First of all my background: I played ~300 hours of Raptor Call of the Shadows when I was growing up (shareware version from a magazine, then I bought the full version that Apogee mailed to me on floppies).If you loved Raptor you'll love this.If you saw screenshots of Raptor without understanding it, or prefer Japanese-style bullet hell shooters, or side scrollers, you might not like this.The tactical combat is almost exactly like Raptor, right down to most enemies shooting yellow orbs at you (and the ""wave"" gun and auto-targetting laser). You will take damage, that's unavoidable, so shield/armor management is an important part of each level (just like Raptor). You can equip multiple weapons with vastly different weapon patterns. Target priority and order is very important, as is deciding between air and ground. Lots of neat enemies and some fun levels with your plane flying higher/lower or the view rotating.First some complaints I read, but didn't experience. Not sure if the dev just fixed them over time or if the original issue was wrong. Either way:- Grinding - There was grinding in Raptor. If you don't think so you didn't play Elite difficulty, where you had to farm the lower difficulties for money and upgrades. Even before the final Outer Regions waves you'd farm the earlier levels that dropped shields to have more than the max. So redoing some missions or a bit of skirmish here shouldn't be unfamiliar or unfun.- Performance - Ran fine for me. I didn't have an fps counter on, so maybe the framerate dropped, but projectiles were still dodge-able and there was no visible stutter. When playing the graphics actually look better than the screenshots.- Slowness - For the screen/view size the plane is almost exactly as fast as Raptor. Again, expectations.- Anemic Weapons - Depending on your loadout you might have to stay on a target for a bit. There are few one shots here. No surprises considering how long even late-game Raptor took to kill some enemies. This means you need to get used to how many shots it takes to kill an enemy, and not waste more than that.- Hitboxes - Your plane/ship seems accurately represented, and I've dodged shots by what felt like pixels. Sometimes enemies have deceiving hitboxes in regards to their shape, but that's pretty rare.- PhysX - Someone mentioned needing older Nvidia drivers for this game. I ran it fine with the latest drivers at the time.So basically a lot of the complaints can be explained as: that's how Raptor did it.If I DID have a complaint with the game it's that incoming enemies don't have shadows, which makes it a bit hard to be pre-firing at the right area. The backgrounds can similarly be a bit distracting/overwhelming at times. And the weapon and equipment could use better ordering or sorting in the shop. Not anything game breaking though.But that is balanced but a dozen pros, a few of which I'll list here:- Random Levels - I would have killed for this feature as a kid. You can choose a seed and get a random level complete with a boss. So fun and so replayable, and really adds enjoyment to any ""grinding"" aspect. In addition the campaign is 20 levels, plus another 4 unique plus 8 types of random for skirmish.- Shield Recharge - Shields have a recharge delay and rate which kicks in once you start shooting. Managing this is a lot of fun and adds a new dynamic.- Enemies Return - If you don't kill an enemy they come back later (and reward less scrap on death). So levels quickly spiral if you miss kills.- Ground and Air - Very fun switching between the two, and it's a bit more seamless than Raptor where you'd have to swap active weapons. Here you just hold ""Shift"" to fire any available ground weapons.- Builds - With perks and such varied weapons you get a lot of choice to each playthrough. You could focus on Plasma, or maybe go for rebounding missiles, or rapid firing machine guns.- Modes - Some really unique and imaginative modes outside the main campaign, such as competitive ""Battle Chains"". Great amount of content for such an inexpensive game.In summary the best way to describe this game is an underrated gem and spiritual successor to Raptor. I'm sad for the dev that it didn't get more initial praise and seems to be misunderstood by the majority of the community.Well I'm happy to say as a hardcore Raptor player this hits the EXACT right spot.(And if your time is worth anything at all, in the time you read this review you earned well over the price of the game"

The Steam bargain bin is kinda like a box of chocolates though. There's good, there's bad, and the doctors say if I have any more they'll take my foot. And sometimes, there's stuff like Revolution Ace.Does your dad like to play the computey games? Maybe your grandpa? Do they talk about all the Japs they killed in The War? Are modern games too hard for them? Have them play this. They'll love it.Revolution Ace is an old-school shoot-em-up, in the same vein as classics like Raptor or Tyrian. Or like Xevious, you probably know what Xevious is. Space Invaders. Pew-pew? The games they used to play on big ♥♥♥♥ing stove♥♥♥♥♥things. Not a hard concept to visualize.You steer a ship around an auto-scrolling level and shoot incoming enemies. Sometimes you get power-ups, sometimes you don't. The communists would love to promise you power-ups guaranteed for everyone, but they're full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Commie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Revolution Ace is a decent shoot-em-up for a semi-modern take on MS-DOS classics, though somewhat slower paced than most.Not particularly original, as most of it is a revisiting of elements from older classic shooters, shooters that are freeware you can literally just download for free somewhere. But people love retro, that's totally cool. Most indie games are just rehashed retro games anyway, right? They got the jumping, the shooting, and all the stuff you used to play on your old Nintendo computer game system. Same thing, right? Just like grandpa used to play. Only he played in real life, and killed real people. Ha ha, good old gramps.Touting full 3D environments and all the marvels of modern graphics, complete with Unreal Engine power and real water physics simulation, Revolution Ace looks great. They put all those fancy words in the game description, just like a real AAA game. It definitely looks more modern and recent than any older shooter, which is really just common sense. It's not playing on a ♥♥♥♥ing calculator display. Of course it's going to look better. But there in comes the biggest gripe I had with the game.None of it is necessary, none of it improves the core gameplay, and at times it actually detracts from the experience. You don't need to put a pound of sprinkles on a cracker with some whipped cream on it. They won't all fit, and you won't even be able to see the cracker. And who the ♥♥♥♥ would put whipped cream on a cracker in the first place? There's no reason for that. There's no excuse. It really feels like their priorities were a little backwards.Bullets are near indistinguishable from the background on certain maps, the Call of Duty color palette melding together into a mess of movement that's almost dizzying at times. Sometimes entire enemies, or your own ship even, will get lost amid all the action on screen. There's just too much going on, everywhere, all the time. I don't mind the fancy backgrounds, but something to make the things you should actually be keeping your eye on more pronounced from the environment would've been really helpful. A more stylized approach probably would've went over a lot better.Revolution Ace's odd graphical quirks don't stop at its overly obnoxious backgrounds though. There's multilevel enemy placement, with certain enemies in the air, and certain ones on the ground. Different buttons will be your ground attack and air attack, so you need to make sure you know what you're aiming at. Which is kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥ when you can't differentiate what is what.Do you know the difference between a boat and a ship? Now imagine that same boat and ship, the exact same size, with almost no way to differentiate 3D space. That way, if you're fighting over a very plain ocean backdrop, they can still confuse you. Gotta make sure you're frustrated somehow. It's something you get used to, but a graphical oversight nonetheless.The game's graphical issues reach their height of absolute exasperation in the multiplayer modes, which shrinks everything down for split-screen action. There's just too much happening on screen and not enough room to display it all, especially when the backgrounds make seeing interactable objects as hard as it already does.I was able to work past the odd graphical design choices, but even then it's not a particularly great shoot-em-up. The slower pace is alright at first, but levels become a complete slog as you progress. The bizarre RPG elements don't quite fit. Upgrading and customizing your ship, I'm down with. Raptor had that, Tyrian had that. But the sluggish leveling and upgrading system in Revolution Ace almost requires you to go back and play older levels purely to grind for experience to unlock more weapon slots.Enemies can take a surprising amount of bullets for a shoot-em-up, so you're gonna be stuck letting waves of enemies fly right past you because it's impossible to take them down without sitting directly in their line of fire for a few precious seconds. After the early levels, the enjoyment factor drops significantly. There's a substantial hurdle before the game becomes enjoyable again, and even then it requires a ton of grinding in a game that really didn't need this kind of system in the first place.It's really not a bad game, just a significantly flawed game. It definitely tries its best, but ultimately falls flat and generally feels a little uninspired and dull. The multiplayer mode is a fun little twist, but suffers from the rest of the game's faults and can't really pull the rest of the experience up. Plus it's a game I bought for a nickel on Steam, the servers aren't exactly lit.I can't help but feel like they really just screwed themselves over with the biggest market that would actually pay for that game, and that's old people. There's too many bright colors and that hurts their eyes, they can't play this. They're gonna drop this faster than folks drop at the retirement center. They're gonna go back to playing cards and staring wistfully out windows at autumn trees shedding their leaves, taking in the subtle symbolic nature of death and renewal. And how much they hate the kids these days.Our view will pan to the lone leaf fluttering in the breeze, shaking loose and blowing away while they blissfully slip into a sleep they'll never wake from. They're dead. The caretaker will discover them in the morning when they go to sweep the dust off of them, and they will say ""Oh well"".That's how I feel about this game. Oh well.Oh well."

,Not Recommended,274560,30236588,Posted: 28 February,all,Titanic21,"Why do I dislike an Unreal-Engine-crafted game I bought for 11ct as a product out of the ""Hyperspace pack""? Simply because ""Revolution Ace"" doesn't feel like being worth that little sum. I know it's unfair, but there are some other titles from the genre I have enjoyed more. If I made a list here, there would be more positive aspects than negatives, but two of them overweight. I don't really enjoy to dislike such a game, as I have been looking for good bullet-hell-shooters for a long time, so I will point out the things I like at first.There's the soundtrack, which is surprisingly epic. Orchestral synthesizer, combined with catchy melodies match perfectly the game's atmosphere. As music is an important element of the game, Laser guided games deserve my thumb up for their OST.The gameplay is pretty standart for such a game, but as advertised, the upgrade system is pretty attractive. Thumb up for that!Phantastic working physics, destructible buildings, there you go!Local two player... I guess there's no need to explain any further, thumbs up to you!A few things I neither like nor dislike would be...The story. Sure, it's good they made one but it's nothing special, pretty average to be honest.The gameplay, as said before, Revolution Ace has neither innovative nor complex abilities, there's HUD, two primary and a secondary weapon(s), one special ability, shields, powerups and stuff. I have seen all of that once or twice before but without those this wouldn't be a game.And now for the part which is important for my review: The things I dislike. There are three, two of which are directly related to each other. I will start right with the other one.Ground troopers. (...) Oh seriously, they are SO DAMN ANNOYING! The aiming is absolute garbage, ground unites are close to impossible to be hit. Maybe it's my fault, but because of the decrease of gaming experience I want you to take that thumb down, right between your eyes.So now you will finally be able to read the reason for my dislike:For usage of Unreal technology the graphics are a shame. They prove us that they used Unreal Engine to power the animations but the result is ugly as hell. I am especially disappointed of the effects. Even on high graphics, the quality is pitiable. Two thumbs down for that, there's no way I could do else.Directly belonging to this: Lags. Seems untrustworthy, I know, but I do really think that a GTX630 (M) should be able to take over this. It couldn't. While I had around 20 FPS on high quality, on low resolution settings this often framedropped horribly. Not a desirable condition at all, but in a game that requires close reaction, that is even worse. I can't explain why exactly that always happens, but until it's not fixed, this is absolutely horrible to play. I also give you two thumbs down for that, sorry, it has to be.Developers: I don't want to blame you. Wait, in fact, I do indeed. The thing is that not the bad graphics make this game bad, but it's your advertising. If you hadn't highly praised your engine, I maybe wouldn't complain. I wouldn't even consider the graphics being bad, as this isn't even necessary for a game to be good. But for unreal standarts what you did is unacceptable. And the performance issues mess with the fun the players should develop even more. If I am a single case, I am sorry, but this is still my opinion."

Other reviews mention other games like Raptor, etc.   The last time I played games like this was either in the arcade or with some DOS games.  It does provide some nostalgia.  You can mount weapons that are air to air only, air to ground only, or universal.   As you earn points from killing full waves and also total number of kills, as well as the fortress or bosses, you gain both a chance for perks with your level and also you earn credits to purchase newer weapons or older weapons to swap into your various mounts.  You can store some in your inventory once bought, to be swapped in as the mission, in your opinion, dictates.  You can replay any mission via Skirmish, there is a campaign, and there is co-op, and a believe multiplayer.  I simply played single player through the first 4 missions or so and via skirmish.This is not exactly my sort of game.  Although I did play some of the earlier DOS games like this, enjoyed Galaga at the Mall, and especially enjoyed Xevious.  This game is not unlike them.   That's the main positive.The negative is that it is not that responsive and given that it takes a much larger footprint to accomplish the same thing, I think you might be, in some ways, better off playing older/similar games.  The graphics are not astonishing, nor are they necessarily better.    In defense of the game, I'm simply playing this on an Intel HD 2500 gpu, with an i5 rated around 3.4 GHz.   Still, this is not the most efficient program, but then, DOS and even Win95/98 were much more efficient to run on a computer for this sort of program.So, it is fun, but it is not all that responsive.  I found that, for me, the main issue, is that the keyboard response for the airplane is a bit less responsive than I like.  I had expected it to run more efficiently.If you have a decent video card, which I'm sure doesn't have to be that modern, you probably won't mind.  But I caution that this is a greater slowdown than I found in Skyrim, Bioshock, most FPS games in my library, and the like.   But games vary.   Where I had no problem running Dead Island with consistently good framerate, there is no doubt that Dead Island Riptide runs sluggishly, at least during the tutorial.Still, I'd expect better from Revolution Ace.Other than that, the game is similar, although it seems a bit less fair than Xevious.   It seems you are challenged more from the lower part of the screen than Xevious and the like.   Nonetheless it is adequate, if you have the time to learn the patterns and have good responsiveness.  It's relatively fair, looks ok, and is enjoyable.I got the game on sale for a mere $0.19  , that's an incredible price.   For now, I'd recommend those with laptop integrated graphics to be prepared to be disappointed, although my set-up is a desktop.  But for others, the game should be adequate in performance.   It's nothing revolutionary or stellar.   But it does take you back to the arcade when you want it to.   If you have other arcade like games, reconsider before you pay much for this game.On sale for the price I got it at, it's impossible to complain.  If you have a decent video card, and you don't have some arcade game in the vein of Galaga, Xevious, Raptor, or Zone 66 -- it's worth giving it try.  But if you had already one of those and are happy with their look and responsiveness, I'd say so far it isn't worth adding to the library unless you simply want something new to fill in the gap in that genre.I'm going to recommend it, but again, this is a rather lukewarm recommendation.  If you see one of the older games and they look good enough for you, chances are high they'll be more responsive."

As with Tyrian and Raptor, you can earn money to buy upgrades and weaponry; unlike Tyrian and Raptor, the addition of a leveling system pretty much means it becomes more about grinding than it does skill.Then there are the graphics: in games such as this it is extremely important for the player to be able to see what they are shooting, what they are hitting and what is shooting at them. This game kinda falls flat in that department.

You shoot the enemies with little pixelated pellets that go through your enemies without clear indications that you've done any type of damage to this unit. Enemies you miss go off screen and reappears after a short while with yellow outlines to indicate that this was the unit you didn't manage to kill earlier. It would be easier to kill them if the screen was longer than it is wider making you go left and right less often and if your ship could move a little bit faster it would certainly not cause any harm.I want to give this game a second try but the graphics are so bland that you actually have trouble understanding what is happening.4/10

Actually the four pack was on sale so I gifted two copies of the game to friends, got one for myself and one spare.So, this is a shoot'em up game, obviously, but it's the first one where I had to shoot both air and ground enemies. Really addictive. You earn cash and xp, unlock new weapons, can play local co-op, online or a campaign.When you beat the latter you unlock a +1 difficulty which has more enemies and they are also shoot more bullets than normal ones. If you are good enough to beat +1 you unlock +2 difficulty which is the max?Online mode is interesting.When you make a 5x, 10x, 15x, etc. combo some enemies spawn to your opponent's side.Some of the achievements are hard but somehow I got them all. The music is not irritating nor distracting so for me it was ok-ish. Has trading cards as well if you care about them. Cheap game with good quality. Even paying full price is worth it.

The slight RPG elements are a nice touch. The new weapons and abilities are all cool. The whole Ground vs Air target mechanic is nice gives it some depth. The guns having different facings depending on the slot you put them is also really cool. The levels look nice especially the water thanks to the Unreal Engine used.

I highly recommend cheat engine for this one!First of all, normal is hard. Easy is normal, so bump that difficulty down. If you want to complete the game your options are to cheat or play on easy.To get the positives out of the way since I already sound highly negative, the graphics are adequate. There are many issues with them such as enemy bullets being almost impossible to see on many stages, some stage backgrounds running out so you fight on a black screen (which actually is an improvement!) and some ground enemies being so minor as to be invisible but overall they are servicable graphics.The sound design is minimalistic. The game doesn't feature many songs/tracks but they aren't terrible.Now onto the bad.The leveling system is a huge grind and waste of time, the damage that weapons inflict is not made clear at all and many of the cool weapons have restrictive cooldowns on them. In a ""bullet hell"" game. For what purpose?!Speaking of bullets, enemy bullets are hard to see most the time so dodging is very difficult for the wrong reasons.Stages are way too hard for bosses that are stupidly easy, bullet upgrades feel inferior to starting weapons, shooting the ground doesn't feel intuitive because its difficult to tell what is just background and what is an enemy that needs shooting and the perk system takes too long to ramp up, I beat the game before reaching lv14 and +1 damage on a weapon that does 10 damage is really not noticable, Trust me on that!I beat the game. It took all of 6 fustrating hours. The reward? Just text that says I beat the game.

,Not Recommended,274560,16020707,"Posted: 26 May, 2015",all,Azalius,"Revolution Ace is a PC Shoot Em' Up that, as far as I can tell, tries to reconcile the differences between old school western shmups, where the right equipment saves the day, and new style shmups where location is everything, and hits are incredibly hard to come back from. It also tries to modernize itself with a league of features, some good, some bad. To give a quick, and concise conclusion to this review? I would PERSONALLY rate RA as a ""Maybe/When Cheap"" where you're paying cheap for the game itself. I got it for 20 cents, and my friend and I enjoyed ourselves. But for the majority of that time, we were enjoying each other's company in Co-op and not the game itself. Unfortunately, since Steam has only yes or no as an option, and I feel Yes is too strong an affirmation for this game, I'm picking no. Now I'll explain the Pros and Cons:Pros:- The game has functional co-op for the most part, and while I'm sure the Devs might argue otherwise, I feel it was built with co-op as a main intention. I believe enemy HP is cut down somewhat in single player and the ship number is based on difficulty and not whether or not it's SP or MP. Also, the way the gameplay works, it has encouraged teamwork between the two of us beyond ""both of you shoot at it until it dies.""- The game's versus ideas are great. The idea of being able to do offline challenge modes that escalate between you and your opponent, while done before, seems competently done. Direct versus is fun as you watch your partner do better or worse than you in certain areas, constantly trying to outdo one another's score and take advantage of competitive-only upgrades and modifications to equipment. Kudos to the dev for making their random levels work with this system as well by supplying the same seed to both clients.- The game DOES fill a niche that we haven't seen met recently. At the heart of it is a game that wants to be ""Raptor: Call of the Shadows"" if it were made today, with technological and game design advances. However, it can and DOES need improvement, the sort a Revolution Ace 2 would hopefully present.Cons:- The perk system hurts the game because you cannot respec them, either grind ridiculous hard to have all of them or start over with another profile. It also directly gates off better weapon variety, weapon slots on your ship, and eventually, objectively superior weaponry/equipment.- Weapons (and WEAPON SLOTS) being locked off by leveling means you don't actually do as much damage as you need to until you hit those high levels. And even then, it often doesn't feel like enough unless you've properly specced yourself. Another casualty of this is the feel of these weapons. They have generic sounds and since they don't tear through ships HALF as well as Raptor's or Tyrian's do? They not only feel weak, but are confirmed so. Complicate this with a A2G and A2A system where you specifically have to choose between the two (EVEN IF YOU HAVE WEAPONS THAT CAN DO BOTH, UNLIKE RAPTOR!) and the game makes you dance to its tune more than it needs to.- A regenerating shield system that attempts to harp Raptor but falls flat because it requires you to stop firing, a bad idea for the following reason. It would've been better to just make it regenerate if you avoid being hit for a while to let you choose between staying in the fray and keeping it from getting out of hand or waiting for half to full regeneration in relative safety.- Enemies come back again. Depending on the difficulty they can come back once, twice or thrice, or infinite times. You WILL have moments that feel less old school American shmup like Tyrian 2000 and more Japanese Bullet-Hell Shmup like Crimzon Clover, without the tiny hitbox grace that the latter trades off for dying on hit. Being overwhelmed is not only a very real possibility, it's a very real likelihood if you're not doing so well.-Some enemies are incredibly annoying to deal with. Later levels involve enemies that quickly fly across the screen spamming bullets. I can only imagine the nightmare of Nightmare Mode, where you're trying to hit them knowing they'd stick around indefinitely if you didn't.-Very inconsistent artstyle means you'll be facing enemies that look hobbled together from a variety of artists...because the credits demonstrate they WERE. This also means garbage like white bullets hidden by clouds and bright blue bullets that nearly match the background sky.-A pointless storyline. Yes, shmups are usually games that don't need a plot, but the random blurbs you get every few levels hint at a mastermind and/or cause between the malfunctioning war machines...but doesn't at all elaborate, instead constantly presenting WHODUNIT? possibilities. Having no plot at all is actually BETTER than that.-Their amazing water effects sounds great until you drop a super bomb on it and it goes through the grounds. They wanted to make that a special note? I'll make it a special one here.Overall it's a game that I feel is playable, outside of a few bosses who apparently don't have synced up attacks in co-op. But it's a game you'll play through and occasionally pick up again for co-op purposes, not a game you'll keep coming back for more. Hence why I'd rate it as a Maybe, but since there's no Maybe and the cons outweigh the pros, a No is a must."

The music and sound is mediocre and the graphics look pretty drab. The plot is insipid and uninventive. Cooperative (and uncooperative) multiplayer modes with another computer can be set up through steam but the process is unintuitive and a little bit tricky. Once you get it working however, the multiplayer modes work very reliably. The game's pace (and perceived rate of motion) is quite slow for the type of arcade-style action shooter game that it is. However, everything else about this game is very well done. The game has 4 difficulty levels and offers a more challenging version of itself to play after you beat the main campaign. Individual levels can be replayed easily. Playing any mode allows you to earn more monies for upgrading your airplane too and the upgrade and leveling system is well designed. The game also has a random mode which can give you a random fight above any terrain type you want. For just 5 dollars (without it even being on a special steam sale) this game is quite extensive and replayable."

,Not Recommended,274560,16592561,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,"You, But Stronger","This is not a bad shmup by any means. However, there's one critical issue that is holding me back from recommending it: energy.In my opinion, a good shmup NEEDS to have energy. You must be the last hope for humanity, maybe witnessing your allies die in the opening cut-scene. The music needs to be pumping through your blood non-stop. Basically, the feel of the game MUST be energizing and insanely epic. This game just sort of says, ""Fight the bad guys if you want to... it's really not that big of a deal. The war isn't that important anyways. And I wouldn't even say 'war' since it's pretty much just a small 5-minute conflict between some American soldiers and a crazed Jihadist somewhere in Afghanistan."" What I mean by this is that there really isn't anything driving you to PILOT YOUR CRAFT THROUGH THE SWARMS OF ENEMIES, ANNIHILATING THE ENTIRE ARMY SINGLEHANDEDLY, SINCE YOU ARE HUMANITY'S LAST HOPE. It's just... boring.There are a bunch of cool game-modes (most of them multiplayer in some way) that I REALLY dig, but the lack of energy prevents me from enjoying the game. Tacking on some cool game-modes doesn't make the game exciting when it's in reality, pretty bland.The moral of the story is that you should just pass this one up. There are so many better shmups in the world, many of them right here on Steam. Crimzon Clover, the Tale of Alltynex, and, of course, the legendary Ikaruga. Those all have an insane amount of energy- play those first, and then you'll understand what I'm talking about here.There are definitely some good parts to this game that I have never seen before (and, consequently, highly respect the developers for) like the graphics and game-modes, but Revolution Ace just isn't worth your time. I went into this expecting a niche shmup that would satisfy my shmup-craving soul, but it isn't quite that. Shmup fans, look elsewhere (seriously, get those shmups I mentioned above NOW if you haven't already). If you aren't a shmup fan... don't let this be your first voyage into the amazing genre."

This wouldn't be so infuriating if you could launch both attacks at the same time and if enemies were properly sequenced so that you can get 100% kills- Time delays on super weapons are too long. It would be better to have shorter time delays or even better yet, the ability to stock up using scrap before each mission, so that you can use better timing during a mission to get more kills (providing of course that enemy sequencing is good) and for drops of super weapons to happen during missions.To me this game is unfinished because they built all of the elements, but didn't put them together very well. If they'd put everything together very well and put some actual thought into more cohesive level design and gameplay mechanics, this game would have been much more awesome.

To do so, there are 4 different gaming mods. You can play a campaign or you can do the skirmish where you can choose a level you want to play. If you want to play against other players, there's a versus and a battle chains mod.But even with some cons, this game is fun to play. Especially the hunt for all achievements is fun and the developers made it just in a right difficulty level to get them all.Summary:+fun for arcade lovers+upgrades for jet+perks for level update+multiple weapons+versus and multiplayer mod+soundtrack+low price+steam cards & achievements+nice badge-storyline-drag'n'drop bug in the shop-aiming issues with targets on the ground-not enough online player"

It seems that not much love went into making it. No offence to the creators if in fact some lovedidgo into making it.If it had abetterstory, or on the go weapon upgrades, then I would like it a little better. But as it isit's just kinda bland. I did like the challenge system of posting recordings of your runs and challenging otherpeople to beat your score, and the abillity to send enemies over to your opponent when you do well is nice.That being said, I did have a little fun playing it, if my play time is any indication (nine hours as of writing).If you like playing every single shmup that you happen accross, then give it a go, otherwise can't recommend."

On the one hand, this is one of the very few modern shoot-em-ups that take its inspiration directly from Raptor - my most favourite shmup of all times (you may love Tyrian more - I forgive you, but I don't understand you). Not from R-Type, Gradius or other Japanse games which I mostly disliked, and which eventurally evolved into bullet-hell genre, which I avoid at all costs.On the other hand, while Ravolution Ace takes a lot from Raptor, it does not always succeeds in copying, and additional elements sometimes seem to make matters even worse.Firstly, this game is very hard. On Normal, it plays a lot like Raptor on the highest difficulty. Even the basic enemies can take a lot of punishment, and your weaponary is not up to it. You WILL skip a lot of enemies, even in the first levels, and you will probably fail to complete on of them. The solution, unfortunately, is grinding. New weapons cost a lot, but they matter. While they will never make you feel like an invinsible super-hero, they will, at least, make it possible to get to the next level's boss with enough shields and armor to take it down.Grinding is a cornerstone of this game. I don't like to grind, so this is a huge minus for me. Fortunately, there are a few ways to grind, which make it more interesting. Boss Attacks are the quickest: pretty soon, you can manage to grind Boss Attack I with your eyes closed. But they pay not very much. Replaying levels you already completed in Campaign also is not very lucrative. But Random levels can bring you a lot of cash! At 20 level, a pass through ""Random Skies"" will get you about 80K credits - about 1/3 of money you need to buy _any_ top-tier weapon. Also, since enemies (but not landspace) is randomized, it's slightly less boring to grind those.Another big problem with this game is enemies and bullets. In a way, this game deserves the name of bullet-hell much more than any Touhou title: in a lot of levels, the screen will be filled with bullets, but they will not be flying in any disernable pattern. It will be utter chaos, and you will NOT be able to eavde them all! Also, many bullets, especially from ground vehicles, are VERY hard to see, especially with all the explosions happening in the sky. You will often take a lot of damage from unseen sources before you understand what is going on.Enemies also do not have obvious patterns. Memorizing a level will only help you a little, this is not a game about memorization.The need to switch between firing at ground or at air enemies is sometimes frustrating. I'm not sure if it is a good idea at all. In Raptor, some weapons only worked on ground units, and some only on air, and that was enough, really.So, in the end:Pros:+ Raptor-inspired shmup+ Nice visuals+ Interesting, if somewhat unsatisfying weapons (it gets better at the top tier, it really does)+ Level-up system (Perks)Cons:- Very hard, probably endlessly frustrating for a novice players, but a bit too challenging even for me sometimes- Requires a lot of grinding (but grinding can be varied, so it's not as boring as it could be)- Bullets lack patterns and hard to see on backgroundFor some reasons, it also has a multiplayer mode. I never wanted a multiplayer mode in a shmup, but I guess some people enjoy it..."

,Recommended,274560,20045543,"Posted: 28 December, 2015",all,Red,"tl;dr: A good raptor clone featuring a lot of customization and different game types, with a huge replay value and it's not hard to 100%.  Also, it's cheap.A great game, certainly underrated.As some have already mentioned, there are some similarities between this game and Raptor: Call of shadows. This game may look the same, but it doesn't FEEL the same at all.Like Raptor, this game has a lot of enemies (both in air/ground), encourage a lot of customization (regular weapons, special weapons/nukes and shields) and the core gameplay feels similar.But that's where the similarities end. Some of the enemies may behave a lot like the ones in raptor, but most of them don't. Some of them are really unique and original, and need different loadouts and strategies to defeat. Ground bosses, for example, can't be hit by air only weapons, so you have to set your loadout to fight them. And that leads to the second point: Customization.In this game you have A LOT of weapons to buy and equip. To do that you'll need to purchase them and equip it in your ship, to a maximum of 6 weapon slots that open when you level up. When you level up you can also unlock new weapons to buy.  But the customization do not stop at regular weapons, you can also equip different shields and special weapons to set your loadout in a unique combination. For example, you could equip a bulky shield (high armor, low recharge rate) and the shield booster superweapon (recharge 50% of the shield) to have a huge shield and to be able to recharge it fast. Also talking about customization, you get perks to choose when you level up. Those can add damage to specific weapon types (plasma, beam, missile...), armor, damage to buildings and more.One downside that many have mentioned is that in the beggining your ship feel really underpowered, and I have to agree with that. But when you gain levels, weapons, slots and perks, that gets better.The game also have a lot of different game modes: Campaign (around 20 missions if I recall correctly), Skirmish (free play the missions and other stages), versus (2 people play side by side, whoever dies first lose) and battle chains (pseudo multiplayer with score attack).If you clear the campaign. there is the +1 and +2 campaign, that are way harder, so it have a lot of replay value.For the completionists, it's not hard to get every achievement. Even the ones that require versus and battle chains can be unlocked by replaying your own battle chains, so you don't really need multiplayer to 100%.If that's not enough reason, this game is absolutely cheap. I mean, REALLY cheap. And even get on sale sometimes."

It has frame rate problems, the bullets blend in with the background, and generally it's a bit of a mess. But somehow when I was playing it, something made me look past all that and I really did have a good time. It has an upgrade system that definitely helps with the sense of progression, a fun but challenging boss at the end of each stage, and a neat system of air bullets vs ground bullets, forcing you to pick between whether you're shooting in the background or in the foreground.But by far the best part of the game is the multiplayer. It takes all the problems I mentioned and kinda blurs them out of your mind, because, at least for me, I was more focused on playing a game with my friend and the issues became less glaring. There's also a cool multiplayer versus mode, which I've never seen implimented into a top-down shooter before. It works pretty well.As a whole, Revolution Ace was like a fat guy sitting in front of you at a playoff game. It's annoying at first, sure, but if you can look past the problems, you have a great game in front of you. It's a fun experience, and you should definitely consider picking it up if you have some friends to play it with.ProsUpgrades systemInteractive environmentsInteresting air vs ground mechanicsGreat multiplayerConsFrame rate issuesBullets tend to blend in with the backgroundLasts maybe a bit longer than it needs to"

I have seen many better games but this I can say this one is good, in a way.The preview screenshots explain pretty much all about the game.My rating: roughly 3/10Reasons of playing:-    Bought during Steam Sale at a price where selling all the cards in the current market would actually profit by a few cent. (Now I see that as a a marketing strategy)My experience:-    At the moment, I am at +3. The real game started when I was around something-teenth level where all equipment slots are unlocked, and I got to get past x5 combo. Things gets harder and my weapons seems to have hit their limit and I can only rely on Perks.-    The split screen is something one has to get used to. It feels very different and makes those blend-in bullets and enemies harder to visually detect.-    I'm not very sure about this, but some weapons seem pointless or too useless to me. Carpet Bomb for an instance.What I like:-    The campaign does not end at final stage.-    Various weapons and builds to choose.-    The scenery is nice, and the graphic is good. So good that I sometimes fail to detect enemies' bullets or the enemies themselves standing right there.-    The game supports multiplayer, versus and co-op, local and global.What I don't like:-    Level. It makes this game seems grinding. (I know it's not quite but...) It also makes the early game so slow that you couldn't defeat many enemies.-    Perks. They come so early in the game that I didn't know what to do with them. They also matter so much that I want to reassign them without having to restart the game. Is there a way to do so, or can you maximize them all eventually?-    Scraps. They are harder to find at the beginning, where you will want to try out various weapons, but once you get all elite ones, they don't really matter anymore and just pile up.-    Replayability is very low. This means I don't want to play all over again because of all these grindings.-    A Bug where some enemies destroyed before their action still shoot. At that point, nothing can be done to them anymore because they are already 'destroyed'.-    Versus/Battle Chain Mode. While I do like the fact the it supports multiplayer, I don't like the fact that you have to play multiplayer for Steam achievements. It's not that I don't like the idea, but it is just not right with number of players who are still playing and participating. Also, from my experience, Battle Chain is still a little buggy. Sudennly the boss disappears and becomes invulnerable, thus impossible to win.-    To sum it up, pretty much everything else...Something else to say:-    Since the number of players in this game is not that high, expect difficulties playing globally."

A good comparison with one game of the 80's may be Foundations Waste, because of the similar setting in terms of story, enemies and landscapes. But, of course, a game that occupies 2000 times as much space should be claimed as an evolution compared to the games of former times. This is possible and justifiable. Speaking of the ship with its guns and shields, the game modes and the graphics, it's a pleasure to be part of the action. The sound is a mixture of patterns of games of the past and the difficulty levels allow the player to challenge his/her limit.Not so special for games of nowadays, but nevertheless interesting, is the battle chain competition mode, where two players fight against each other by creating a battle chain in sending more and more enemy units to the other player, who is obliged to destroy them quickly to counter strike his opponent. All in all, it's a solid evolution of a classical game type."
,Not Recommended,274560,29680066,Posted: 3 February,all,The_True_Meller,"If you drop the somewhat iffy Terminator-like background story and the hangar where you can customize your air vehicle of destruction, this reminds me very much of an old Sega Shootemup called Thunder Blade from the 80's - the game I liked a lot back then, even with all its home computer port clunkiness compared to the sleek machine of destruction that the arcade hall version was. The 3rd person perspective is missing, but the vertical dashes and objects coming towards your very face from the battlefield are  there, not to mention the overall feel plus both air and ground targets to be destroyed either with projectiles or missiles.Nostalgia aside, this mindless-but-fun intended little vehicle has more clunkiness than it should for the maximisation of said / promised mindless destructive fun. You choose your weapons (and buy more when you get cash and level up, increasing your weapon slots and thus firepower), you fly, you select whether to shoot air or ground targets with them, you fight the end level boss (sometimes mid-bosses too), you collect your exp and cash, next level, repeat, etc. etc. Despite of the vehicle customization options that grow rather nicely when advancing the levels and experience, the game still is tactically shallow and has frankly few winning weapon combos that are most probably used in expese of every other gun there is. What is the worst, it gets repetetive quite fast no matter ho hard it tries with the variation of enemies to shoot and weapons to shoot them at.Granted, it looks, sounds and feels like a nostalgia time machine with some modern game design twists and therefore has some charm, and I can't complain of any bugs or bad controls. Still, I feel it falls short even in the retro destruction department. Blowing this much stuff up with heavily armed flying death machine really shouldn't feel this... dull. So far I have plodded through for around 15 or so missions of the campaign mode and I'm daft enough to soldier them all through, but only because I'm stubborn that way. For you, there are better and more versatile shooters out there."
