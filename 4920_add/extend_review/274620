,Recommended,274620,16949753,"Posted: 8 July, 2015",all,Maximum Sloth,"**Edited 9/18/2015I would like to start this review by commending the Development Team for being extraordinarily involved with the community and quite friendly. I asked a question before purchasing the game and the creator of Skara The Blade Remains, cromlech_, responded in a detailed and helpful manner. He then proceeded to invite me to his friend list and took the time to chat with me about my opinion regarding the game. This Dev team seems to be trying really hard to engage the community, be transparent, and take all of our suggestions to heart, and it's wonderful. For anyone interested in Q&A about the game etc., I recommend asking on the forums about when there will be Dev streams on Twitch. After the Q&A they will also be playing the game, so you can watch live footage straight from the Devs. See the TL;DR at the bottom for a short summary of my review.Now, for the actual review- which I will likely edit as I play more of the game, play more characters, and as the game evolves:As you would have likely noted, this game just released in a true Alpha state rather recently(about 3-4 months ago). Currently, since the announcement of true alpha, there has been at least one update a month; the last two updates added a playable tutorial, some new skills, bug fixes, implementation of suggestions by the community such as keybinding etc., This game is still in early Alpha - and I repeat, IT IS EARLY ALPHA. Do not expect a fully fleshed out game yet. The framework is there, and it looks quite promising. It will be free to play in the future, so if you would like to wait until its full release to play, then by all means, please do so. That being said, right now your job if you purchase this game is to test current balance between characters, test maps and game systems, and make suggestions on how to improve the game - because the Devs will listen and almost always respond.General Gameplay - This game has a ton of potential and will be ludicrously fun once all the features are implemented. Right now there are 3 maps, one for each game mode, with plans for more. Some have lava(fall in it and you die) and levers that activate certain map effects. For example, in one map there's a ring in the center that gives way if you hit the lever and this leads to you, or your enemy, tumbling down into a pit of lava. There's also a huge boss-like monster that arises from within the depths of an arena. Currently this monster is an NPC and will attack every player that comes near it - players get extra points for hitting and killing it. A clever player could just stand back as his/her feeble opponents attempt to battle it..and pick them off as they back away in horror. Alas, you will respawn after perishing..so find solace in that.There are 3 game modes. Team deathmatch, free for all, and duel. They are fairly self-explanatory. - I will update this section further the more I play, if I notice any notable deviations.Each character, as you level up, has a set of skills the player can pick. Hold down RT or RB on the gamepad to execute said skills. Shinse has a skill that makes her invisible for a short period of time, and a teleportation ability that switches the player's position with that of his/her target. Also, the devs recently added an ability called, ""forest wind,"" basically you can dash forward in a straight line, damaging any opponents in your path. They also added 1 new skill for the other two currently playable characters, which you can unlock through progressing(leveling up). There are plans to add passive skills and more primary skills.There will be a store where you can buy costumes and weapons with in-game currency as well. These costumes will modify stats.There will be daily quests/missions, factions, gems to modify stats and more in the future. There are placeholders available for them in game already, but they haven't been implemented yet.For new players - There is a playable tutorial right after you create your first character. It explains basic attack, movement, and how to utilize your special attacks. You'll also be able to test out your skills at the end of the tutorial against a few AI opponents.Most of the above systems are fairly barebones at the moment, because, well, it's an early alpha. Once they become more fleshed out, the game will have far more depth. I say that to warn the people expecting some kind of fully fleshed out product, in the hopes that the people purchasing the game will do so knowing that they are helping develop it with their suggestions et al.,Combat Gameplay - Each character utilizes a string based on heavy/light attacks. I use an Xbox 360 gamepad so this would be RB and RT. I have played Shinse, thus far. She is a quick assassin-like character.  Her attacks feel appropriately light and heavy depending on what combination of attacks utilized, and they also look nice. Each character can also throw projectiles, a limited number, per life using the A button. Blocking is here too, but blocking attacks drains stamina - and you do NOT want your stamina drained or your block broken as you will be brutally punished by the AI or other players. That being said, the AI so far is kind of placeholder - For example, if you stealth as Shinse the AI will just stand there until you appear again. The last of the controls I will mention here is the ""dodge"" ability(B on the gamepad), which effectively...dodges. How effective the dodge is depends on your character - some of the heavy characters are a bit slower to dodge.The devs also added 3 new abilities - one for each class, so far I have tried Shinse's out and it is mapped to the X button(again, using a 360 gamepad) by default.Graphics - The game is optimized fairly well for an early alpha, though with recent updates the optimization seems to have gotten a bit worse. That being said, I experienced no notable system lag with all settings maxed. It looks really nice too. I realize ""nice"" is a vague descriptor, but it's the best I have. To put it another way- this game pleases my ocular orbs.Controls - They are quite responsive. There doesn't seem to be any noticeable input lag. This game does have gamepad (360/Xbox) support as well as keyboard support. The developer has implemented keybindings with update 0.5.3.Community/Online - You'll likely match up against the creative developer and creator of the game if you try out the online. Sadly, the community is fairly small at the moment and you may fight exclusively bots a majority of the time. I hope this changes in the future because these guys deserve both your support and your input as both will help make this game great.So if the game is so early, why do I recommend it? Well, because I really like how involved the Developer is with the community, it shows supreme potential that I have no doubt will be met, and as a barebones early alpha, it's actually pretty fun!TL;DR - Right now you're buying into an early alpha, with an established framework(meaning there's stuff there, like characters, some maps to fight on etc., but it's basic at the moment. Many features still have to be implemented), to help test out balance, make suggestions for improvements, and support the developer. That being said, it's only a $5 buy-in, and it is indeed fun even at this early stage of development. ^_^"

However, I enjoy seeing the updates as they come and playing them as soon as possible to get a feel of where the game is going. I heard about Skara a few weeks ago and cannot wait to bring all my friends in to play it when it's more stable :) The graphics are beautiful and what they seem to have in mind keeps me excited for updates.TL;DR,It's early access, buying it now will mean you're getting it before it's ""finished"".If you don't want to go ahead and buy, add it to your wishlist and follow it and check back every so often!"
,Recommended,274620,30073740,Posted: 20 February,all,Kodyd194,"Skara - The Blade Remains seems like it has potential to be a decent fighting game. Right now it is really, really rough. I don't know where it may go in the future but I recommend if you are interested you try it out at least."
76561198013378613,Recommended,274620,30059301,Posted: 20 February,all,Commander Useless,"IntroductionI believe this isn't my first review, although it certainly feels like it. Please forgive me if the following review is somewhat disjointed or disorganized in its structure. I would also like to tell you to take both my review and other reviews of this (and any game) with a pinch of salt. What I've written here are, of course, my own opinions. If this game interests you at all after reading this review, you should try it and form your own opinion on it!Skara - The Blade Remainsis a multiplayer online team-based battle arena (or perhaps I should call it a fighting game?) with controls and gameplay similar to that of Lords of the Fallen or Dark Souls. You could call it a MOBA with the exceptions of the usual towers and minions that are commonly associated with those kind of games - this is all about the fighting. It is being developed by an independant group (in Spain if I'm not mistaken). It is currently in open alpha testing at the time of this review.So what makes this game good?To be perfectly honest, I went into this game with a clean mind. I had read many of the negative (and positive) reviews and so I decided it would be better to form my own opinion. I was quite surprised by the game, though.Skara has a lot of good elements going for it. While it is notthatuncommon to find a third-person MOBA today, I think Skara is one of the only ones that actually has all of its emphasis on the fighting. If you've played a Souls game or something like Dragon's Dogma, you'll get the controls down pretty quickly. Other than your usual WASD-movement controls, your player character has a normal attack and a special attack which they can freely mix into combo attacks. Your character also has a defensive move (for instance, one character can block and another one can counter an attack with the right timing) and the ability to dodge (rolling, stepping or dashing depending on character) which gives you some frames of invincibility. It gives you all the tools necessary for enjoyable (if not a little clunky) intensive fights.Apart from your basic moves, each of the character types have access to three ""Signs"", or abilities, unique to them. These can be all from throwing your shield while setting it on fire like a pyromaniac Captain America, or placing a trap that encases your enemy (or even yourself or your allies!) in ice so they can't move. These Signs add a lot of versatility to your character and really opens up for interesting tactics, especially during group fights.Skara has two game modes currently, with a third one planned for release soon: A 1v1 duel mode and a 3v3 last man standing mode. The third game mode coming out is a 5v5 domination mode. I actually found it very interesting for a game like this to include a duel mode to begin with, and as such it was the first mode I ever played.The biggest thing that Skara has going for it is how player-driven its development is. Players can post their suggestions and ideas for lore and even character designs and game features, and it is very important that they do so as well. A major part of how the game is played today is because of the feedback the game has received since the beginning of its development. At the time of writing this review, the developers are quickly and happily responding to queries and suggestions on the Steam discussion forums all the time, which is quite impressive.Another large part of Skara is its lore, which does take the player-driven development into account. The previous highest-ranking players were placed as part of the game's lore, for instance. There's a lot to read and a lot to add to the lore, and I don't want to spoil it for you in case you decide to try the game out for yourself, so I think that's all I'll write about it.The game currently has a shop where you can pay real currency to buy cosmetics (and only cosmetics, no pay to win here) for the different characters. The reason I bring this up in this section is because, at least in my opinion, the majority of the cosmetics lookreally good! I've already spent some money on pimping out my two favorite characters! The graphics overall look very nice and really portrays the overall kind of grim atmosphere.And what makes this game bad?It really depends on your own tastes. As I mentioned, at the time of this writing the game is in open alpha, so there is a lack of content. The duel mode has one map, a frozen little island in the middle of the sea, and the last mand standing mode also only has one map, the lava coliseum. Currently, there are only 4 (with a 5th in the ""Coming Soon-making) character types to play with, and even while they are very different from each other, there are indeed only 4.There are bugs, of course. When me and a friend tried to add each other to our friends list or party the first time, it just didn't work - we had to restart the game first. Ever since ithasworked though, and when I posted about it on the forums I got a quick reply from one of the developers too. The game is also not very optimized, which is a common thing for an early build, but still might put you off a little if you aren't expecting it. It doesn't slow down dramatically or anything like that, but it can have the occasional stuttering.The matchmaking also seems a bit weird. Even though me and my friend queued up for dueling at the same time, it took the game ~40 seconds of searching for a match before we got to play. It's not a long time, but it is quite strange that it works like that. If you queue up and the game can't find another player, it will pit you against bots until a player takes its/their place.On a final note, I do wish there were more diverse sound effects in the game. The ones that are in are not bad or stock by any means, but how the sound of a spear blade penetrating your flesh is the same sound as a massive pick made out of bone or a curved sword in eastern style is beyond me! It's not gamebreaking though and I imagine this is something that will change as the game develops further.ConclusionSkara - The Blade Remainsis a fun game. Fighting other players, especially in last man standing, is a blast and every fight feels different. It is not a perfect game as it lacks content (it is in alpha, after all) but the content it currently has is quite enjoyable. It has been said many times before, but this game has a lot of good potential (and so far it is not being wasted one bit). The only thing Skara really suffers from is a lack of players, and I can't stress that enough - if the game had more active players, it would likely be the one of the games I've invested the most hours in ever on my steam account, haha.Gameplay- 7/10Audio- 7/10Graphics- 8/10Story (Lore)- 6/10I definitely recommend giving this game a try, especially with friends. Thank you for reading!"
,Recommended,274620,12674034,"Posted: 28 October, 2014",all,ShagNasty.BriskeysGaming,This game could be fun for a arena battle with friends ....if co-op it looks like you would be in a arena with friends against others. The only problem im having is no one is hosting a match yet and i hosted one and waited a while and there's nothing to do unless people are joined in a match to fight.The graphics and character control is really talented artist with alot of potiential.  With what's available on this game i don't agree with the price if it was 1/4th of the price and each arena was a $5 add on that might make sense.But I bought a $20 game and no one to play with me or to battle.I give this a recommend though because I think these guys are onto something good though. I like the graphics and gameplay. It is early access so i'll keep it a recommend for now and see how it goes.

76561198036561843,Not Recommended,274620,29997991,Posted: 17 February,all,Owlflame,"Honestly, this doesn't really feel good.Battles just feel like flailing attacks around until something happen and all the specials feel really cool and strategic until you learn that once you're locked on they'll pretty much always hit regardless. That chain pull axe move, that leap move and a few others just kinda happen. Then you get the damage and it's mostly up to your own incompetence whether or not you can kill your opponent right then and there.I did some single duels and learned that this game feels super not great in a 1 v 1 scenario. Again, if your character can chain attacks together you should have the round free. Abilities are neat but none seeming to matter at all for doing anything else other than damage or getting you the hit.I think the worst part was when I waited for a minute and a half to get a 3 v 3 game going. Then it started and I'm so excited. Then I notice that everyone except me is a bot and everyone dies in the trap in the middle of the stage anyway because the bots are dumb... I'm not immedietly taken with the game.No offense if the developers are reading this, but go play for honor. You guys really need some of that game feel to make this work."

,Recommended,274620,30028569,Posted: 19 February,all,JMynce™,"Skara - The Blade Remains is the newest audition in the competetive play gaming genre introducing unique styled combat and match system, with a lot of story behind every single character the game offers players to try. Although opinions for the game are mixed, the game is still in early phase of development, and for the early stages it is in, the developers have done a lot.The combat style of the game is very unique and distinctive. Each character has 3 special abilities, and two default abilities - strong and normal strike. Strategical thinking and outsmarting the enemy is sometimes essential, because not only your survival and combat skills matter. The game has rich environment interaction, and it allows you trick players into traps leading you to victory. If your enemies are not careful enough, you wouldn't need to engage in combat, and just use the environment to your advantage.Speaking of combat, the game allows players to free run, or lock on targets. Locking on targets is a must for best precision. Sometimes locking on targets unlocks passive abilities - like fast dashing, or running jump spear strike. Some characters have passive abilities, like shield defense.Dive into this clash combat adventure in 1v1, 3v3 or 5v5 modes, each one on a different map, with different environmental rules. Discover the current and new incoming characters, and claim to become the best warrior of your faction in Skara - The Blade Remains.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvbYXnwwgwM&list=PLcPrSuz-BoJ4UGGst6U9i5JruUr1Vrw2h&index=3"

I only knew it existed because I was sent an email by the developer to play it.The controls are clunky, and it doesn't feel that hits even register against opponents. The art style is bland, as it clearly uses default UE4 assets, so little to no work has been put in on that front. And to say that this is ‘Souls-like’. Laughable.In terms of actual gameplay, there’s hardly anything to do. No one seems to be actually be online, so I as soon as loaded the game up I joined a match… Well, I waited five minutes and got a match against ALL bots. No players. I then proceeded to last thirty seconds before my character got stuck in mid-air during a dodge animation, and then was immediately killed by a bot.Don’t play it, don’t invest money into its microtransactions (oh yes, they’re here!) and if I were the developer, I would pull this game from steam and work on it until it was actually IN a playable state, with content and fewer bugs."

I´ve played Blade Symphony which is much better and will still be much better in 1vs1 experience -but if you play Skara in Team Deathmatch it could be a different battle fight feeling. Team Deathmatch will come soon and some new characters. The camera view can´t be changed which should be fixed. Some performance issues and walking bugs (run stuttering) prevent fun in the game. So i don´t play the game often untill it´s finished - better you buy the game if it´s a complete and finished game!UPDATE: The game often crashes!
