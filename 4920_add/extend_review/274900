Cheaper than Arcade games I played as a kid, that lasted for 2 minutes per 4 Quaters.That's really all you need to know.1.) It's LEGIT: The game runs well, and the controlls are TIGHT. This is not crap. It's a real game.2.) It's simple. Start it up, choose a mode, jump in.3.) Online works fine. Not many players, but, we had no problem playing with people all night.4.) It's a buck. Even if we never play it again (we will), it was worth the night of fun we had.5.) It's not ""Like Halo"". Don't know what all that is about. But, it does play like a solid FPS."

First off, what you need to know is that this game is a multiplayer FPS. It's not a ""mining"" or ""survival sandbox"" game by any means. You're shooting other players in a competitive enviornment. The only similarity this game has to minecraft (and I honestly dislike that it  can even be compared to minecraft) is that you build the maps with blocks. That's it. Secondly, you need to know that this game moves and shoots exactly like a Halo game, with the exception that you can do some wall kicks and other moves like that.  If there were one game to compare it to, it'd be Halo. Definitely not Minecraft. Anyways, the last thing you should know is that this game still needs more polish in the graphics and presentation departments. Some of the textures aren't that great, there's no lighting to speak of, and the menus are pretty bland. However, I was able to overlook those shortcomings when I experienced how well the game plays. You'll probably be able to do the same! I'd be sure to hop on this game quickly, because Jforce plans to add a lot to it. These devs have a lot of good ideas for the game. Well, that's all I've got."

However, hidden underneath the minecraft graphics and halo character models, is actually a very solid, addicting, fun FPS. The gunplay and movement are fairly similar to halo, but with the addition of a mining gun (can place/destroy blocks), and a goddamn grappling hook (like in just cause 2). Mix in a gigantic map selection and some hilarious potential game settings (turbo fire alone is rib-crushingly funny for a good 20 minutes), and you have a game that's worth FAR more than the 2 dollar price tag.The only major downside I would like to point out is the lack of players online at off-peak times. Only a couple of games will be up at a time if you aren't playing during the evening on a weekend. Would recommend getting a couple of friends to buy, or gifting a 4-pack to them.Spread the word! Let's get some more people playing this super fun game!"

You'll find yourself in areas with miners AND murderers in this thrilling romantic adventure opera of murder mining.The gameplay is great, as it offers both the ability to murder AND mine.I think however my favourite thing about Murder Miners is its atmosphere, you really lose yourself in this game's themes, which mainly consist of bloody horror involving murder, and deep underground immersive areas with remnants of mining.Overall, I would rate Murder Miners."

Even so there seem to always be at least 2 people online at all times.It has a lot of fun game modes, like infection (just like Halo!)It also comes with a bunch of pre-installed levels that a lot are fan-made versions of popular levels from games (Nuketown from COD, Hoth from SW Battlefront, Kokiri forest from TLoZ: OoT, Zanzibar from Halo 2, etc.), not to mention the tons of more options you can get through downloading MORE custom levels through the Steam workshop.

The gunplay feels like an updated Halo CE with the addition of optional swords, mining/building guns, and grappling hooks. There is a huge variety of levels in the game by default but players may choose to create their own maps, and many popular community maps have been imported over from the Xbox 360 version of the game so you will have no trouble finding remakes and tributes to your favourite games, along with creative maps that take advantage of the customiseable game modes such as parkour and chase maps.Whether you are a casual player looking for something to not take seriously, a competitive player, or just someone looking for a good co-operative experience with friends, this game is perfect for you.

You could say it's a bit memey since there's an actual gun that enables you to place voxel blocks (insert a Minecraft parody song sung by a child here). A well placed balance for that feature is the destructable environment. You could straight up start mining, which straight-up cracked me up.When it comes to the other weapons, the variety is quite satisfying. There's a simple but effective semi-automatic pistol, a shotgun, an SMG that can be alt-fired to spray an entire huge clip, 2 kinds of assault rifles, even a grappling hook, a katana and a sniper rifle with pretty comfortable aiming. It's still got more class than Roblox, being more of a Minecraft-Halo mix.It's really cool that it has a small price tag so that it's kind of separated from F2P stuff, but you can still get it pretty easily. Gifting is easy, especially with sales."
,Recommended,274900,11422501,"Posted: 26 July, 2014",all,Aetrym,"This game is getting a lot of flak for having blocks right now. Most people will take one look at this game called ""Murder Miners"" and rightfully pass right over it because what, do we need another fortresscraft/minecraftclone? I implore you not to judge this game by its title or by its crafty appearance. To do so would be to deny yourself something simple and fun.The reason this title is so cheap is not because it tries to emulate Minecraft. In fact, other than borrowing the ever-trending concept of blocks as landscape, it takes absolutely nothing else from the aforementioned survival block games. Murder Miners takes the best of the shooting genre and combines it with blocks. Its all about the fundamentals: Shooting and building.Lets talk about shooting.The online play is almost exclusively ""guns only"" meaning you won't find many people hosting a public map building session (but thats not to say you won't see them). Most servers will cater to their lobby, asking what maps they like, and what game modes.The guns feel light and maneuverable. In short the games FPS mechanics just feel tight and classic. They offer all the weapons any decent shooter would offer, and they are simple in appearance and function. You get your Halo CE with a little bit of old timey arena shooter, and it feels great. Alot of people will say how fun the Infection mode is, and it truly is. But this isn't why the game shines the brightest in my opinion.The thing that makes this shooter stand out from others is the ""back-to-basics"" mechanics that run through the whole game. It doesn't have time for the weapon attachments, the unnecessary game modes, and the hype surrounding the popular shooters of today. J force instead boils it all down to the raw, uncensored arena FPS.The mobility offered to the player is only expanded by the use of blocks. Players can use steps of blocks (much like Faith uses steps in Mirrors Edge) to ""vault"" by double tapping space. This not only works with steps; any vertical surface can be jumped off of as long as you are gaining altitude, providing endless opportunities to assault your opponents.The building is all done from a mining gun with a built-in block selection interface. You can spawn different types of blocks by selecting them with the arrow keys, and you can place them in four different ways (Line, face, float and fill). The build mechanics are primitive, but there is SO much you can do with primitive. The more fundamental the mechanics are, the more possibilities exist. One look at the workshop is enough to prove that.All in all, the game plays very well, despite the low production value (which will show, believe me). If you like getting your guns on, but have a mind for creativity as well, this game is a great option, and the price of $1.99 is pretty attractive too."

,Recommended,274900,27931230,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,Sweep,"About Murder MinersMurder Miners. Originally launched back on the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace in 2012, this title takes the best aspects of the FPS Halo (In particular, Halo: Combat Evolved) and shoves it into a Voxel Battleground, reminiscent of Minecraft.The game just got out of a closed beta, and in it's current state is pretty much the ultimate edition of the game. For $5 (Currently $4) you get access to hundreds of maps pre-made by JForce and the community, with plenty of your favorites (I'm talking maps like Blood Gulch, pretty much every Halo map, and even Unreal Tournament 2004 maps). You do have the ability to make your own maps, with a pretty in depth map editor comapred to other titles in the genre.Gameplayis where Murder Miners shines. The developers have fine tuned this monster to Quake 3 levels of responsiveness, leaving you with tight, fast controls. Of course, you can always lower it to suit your playstyle; Want to play like your playing Halo? Drop it down to 4. Minecraft? 3. The gunplay is great. You'll have access to 6 weapons; A Halo Battle Rifle, 3 Shot Magnum, Sniper, Energy Sword (Looks like a medieval sword), Shotgun, Machine Gun, and a Hookshot (Grappling hook). These pretty much play like you'd expect them to, and you end up with some sweet ♥♥♥ montage clips when using the grapple hook.The game isn't all running around though. Take to the skies in a Helicopter style vehicle and reign death from above with heavy missles. Take 2 friends up with you to give some additional firepower from above. Or perhaps you're after a burst of speed? No problem, grab a hoverbike and get to work.FeaturesOne of the BEST features of Murder Miners is the Infection Game Mode. Zombies versus Humans. The maps that you get default with this game for Infection are awesomely amazing, such as burnt out cities, military bases, all giving that erry vibe that an enemy isn't too far away. 30 people in an infection game on a big map equals lots o' fun. Plus, if you're a lonely person, you can have zombie AI bots! There's fun for everyone here!All in AllMurder Minersis a very good Action-FPS Game!8/10 From MeSweep"

In simple terms, Murder Miners is a Halo-inspired FPS brewed with a sandbox builder a la Minecraft. Generic, you may think at first glance. And youre probably right.Out of the plethoras upon PLETHORAS of shooter/builder games out there, Murder Miners shines by doing its thing right. Unlike many of its software brothers, Murder Miners sports smooth platforming and shooting mechanics, has a healthy variety of game modes, and in the end delivers what it promises: A fun, skill-requiring multiplayer experience. It may not give you any more, but it wont give you any less.Perhaps I deem worthy of mention only two negatives: As other reviews mention, you wont find many people on the lobbies. They are by no means dead, though.Aaaand... the graphics are pretty bland and dry. But hey, that may be a boon depending on how you look at it. Less lag.Need I say more?"

,Recommended,274900,31731626,Posted: 13 May,all,nick wilde,"Murder miners from first glace looks like a minecraft wanna be game that has guns. well, that's what i thought it was when i saw screenshots of the game. after buying the game, i realized it does try to mix Halo and Minecraft together as a game. it executes it well but not in the way you think.the whole ""Minecraft"" look just means that it has blocks. theres no crafting but you can mine and kill (hence the name murder miners). with blocks, you can make your own map to have people battle each other out. i always loved the idea of massive mutiplayer battles on your own map that you've created. can't make a map? check out what people have made and play on it. and if you want, you can start a plain map and have people build their defences and battle each other. the building aspect of this game is great for a creative mind.the halo side of this game is only some weapons and mechanics. there's the rip-off weapons like the pistol and sniper to the battle riffle. the health bar from halo also makes an appearance with having your shield too. not everything in this game is related to halo so they added many other things you can try for yourself.there are plenty of game modes including team death match, free for all, infection, capture the flag, zombies (swarms of them), and others i'm probably missing. there was a juggernaut mode in the making, but discontinued after the idea of murder miners X which i still doubt will release (it's been years). I like infection because they made the zombies actual zombies instead of half assing it and giving the zombies a sword.there are so much things to do in this game and wished people played it more. most importantly, wished it was updated constantly instead of working on something else.if this game looks interesting, it won't hurt to try it out.

Murder Miners has the same gun play as Halo:CE while adding its own unique twist. Wall-bouncing makes the maps more flexible and more easy to get around. And adding totally customizable destruction (to what map creators want). This game is entirely Multiplayer. Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, CTF, Infection are just some of the gamemodes in this game with more to come down the line. The game runs at 60 FPS (Double of the 360 version) and makes gameplay more smooth and faster-paced than before. Gun play is balanced and fair. And just like Halo, everyone spawns with the same weapon choices. Its nice to see that gunplay was a huge focus for this game as many shooters now a days focus on more is better instead of limited but balanced. If you like Halo's Gameplay, you'll love this game's multiplayer.- Overall Performance: 8/10 *Updated as of July 31st*Issues like crashes have not happened to me personal, but I have seen people complain about it. However, In all most every update (which are frequent) show that they know and are dedicated to resolving issues and bugs while still adding new things to its multiplayer. People have complained about the mouse aiming bug/issue. I have not witnessed this or agree with this. Also, If you're looking for a HUGE community, there is a decent amount but don't be surprised if there are only a few games.Will continue to update and re-review the game once it has been updated.- Replay Value: 10/10This game has the same replay value from Halo 3. With the game comes a TON of maps to play on. Maps from Halo, Counter-strike, Goldeneye 007, Unreal Tournment and many more. Its gamemodes are a ton of fun. If you love infection, this is 2nd greatest infection game (besides Halo) for great fun. One of the features that keep this game alive is the community and workshop. The editor mode is easy and simple to build stuff like Minecraft. All those maps built are in the workshop where you can play even more maps. With more updates coming down the line with new gamemodes, maps and weapons. This game has a ton to offer and play for hundreds of thousands of hours.- Overall Score: 9 / 10Its a great game. If you like Halo or Custom Games you'll love this game. It has so much to offer for the price its offering of $5 USD ($4 USD right now). Although its community isn't as huge as Halo or Counter-strike, its a decent amount. JForce has been a confident with their game from the very beginning and continues to put hardwork forward in every update. Its gameplay is balanced and smooth with some technical flaws but that doesn't stop it from being one of the greatest shooters I've played since the Halo Series. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone."
,Recommended,274900,31473424,Posted: 30 April,all,Hoov,"I actually quite like this game, and only a few things could make it better.1: A Levelling systemA levelling system would provide lots of incentive to keep playing. Make them little icons next to your name in a lobby, and make one for killing zombies and one for killing other players. Levelling up could get you something like a figurine or a keychain you can view in the main menu, and a keychain could be attatched to your weapons. If not figurines or keychains, how about weapon restyles or new armor styles.2: A Few More Zombie TypesZombie survival gets kinda boring with only 2 types of zombies, normal and sword, so maybe add a ranged one that does a bit of damage but is very weak at long range combat. You could also make a zombie that uses the grapple to pull you into hordes and maneuver around.That's really it, I hope you take these into consideration, but I love the game as it is (IMO better than CS:GO)"

Zombies are fierce, and you must act fast. But take a second too long, and you're food-unless your buddy behind you makes a clean kill! When given the chance, build up defenses with the Miner Gun to extend your chance of action! Occasionally, a dead zombie drops small amounts of ammo, so loot when given the opportunity! Free-for-all mode makes you use your brain a bit more. With the speed and agility, you and your enemies will be dashing corners and bouncing off walls here and there. Keep that triggerfinger ready for anything! Team Murdermatch is a different story. Vehicles are strong when every seat is being used, so you need to make a big enough force to startle your enemy and go from defense to offense. Or take to the borderlines and give sniper support to your team as they advance throughout the map. In Murder the Flag, Things get hectic. Because the combat is pretty brutal and quick, you and your team need to be vigilant. You never know what the enemy is doing. That is why you must keep the flag gaurded securly, while a strike team goes to the enemy base and snags the flag. Good luck getting home in one piece. Last but not least, is the horror show of infection. One player starts as a zombie, with the optional help of other Zombie AI. This player must go and kill other humans. Using their tounge to bring the survivor to them, or bloody claws to shred both flesh and construction, the zombies will easily breach the humans line of defense! One by one, the humans will be picked off by the speedy undead. Humans, watch the bodies of the fallen survivors. Zombie players have the chance to eat the dead survivor and evolve traits. Do whatever it takes to halt the zombies, or they will get stronger and stronger before you see it coming! Once you have esperienced the chaos and want to relax, you might want to head over to Map-Making Mode.This is where you create your blocky battlefield.I have introduced Murder Miners to many of my friends, in which they all thought the game was really fun.

I say that is not the case. You can expect blocks, sure, sure. But that is where the minecraft aspect ends.The gameplay is of course, is very much like Halo CE, with the twelve shot magnum, the four shot snipers, motion sensors, and the shields, the players armor, but there's more than that. You have WAY more mobility than in any halo game I have seen. You can sprint, dodge, double jump(more like wall scaling) and 'ram' attack, a special movement option players get in versus modes. they look down while sprinting, increasing their movement speed, and become a deadly walking projectile. So why is this Halo and Minecraft?Halo and Minecraft? No. no, no, no, and no. First, there is no survival concept whatsoever. No food, no home to build before night, and no open world three times the size of earth. There is Forge/ Creative mode, no doubt, but it is not halo and minecraft.My description of Murder Miners would be Halo gameplay hybridized with Unreal Tournament,(Look that game up on here, its pretty sick!) due to the high player mobility, arena maps, and weapon balancing, with a pinch of minecraft blocks.As I'm sure what many of you want to know, how is the infection? I'd say it's probably the best infection you can possibly find in any game, and yes it's 10 times better than halo. In fact, it makes halo infecton look like someone took a giant pile of crap, and combined it with another pile of crap and placed it in a microwave for 10 minutes. Disgusting. As a Zombie, you can tongue grapple, activate radar, and level up by consuming the corpses of the freshly dead. This awesome ability makes you faster and stronger, and your abilities become more efficient. And your levels stick with you after death! It is the first game where I truly had fun playing as zombie.To me, this game was a divine gift from the heavens.

My only favorite thing about this game is the maps some are very beautiful and some look poorly made. Don't waste 5.00$ for a 4 pack nore a dollar to get this game. Get Murder Miners X when it comes out. It will probaly be better. In some forms its a great game really but I have only talked about the negatives. The positves are. Swordfighting is fun and is very entertaing and hookshot is very fun to use. Pulling your friends with it is kind of fun. The helicopter is fun to if you can get the controlls right but overall I whould not reccomend it but hey spend a dollar on it right Yolo its still a good game in some terms.

Eventually you will get used to the graphics, and be focused on the game.Pros-The infection is well though out and extremely fun to play, especially on a full lobby.You can use a miner gun to build with blocks, and even make your own maps other people can play on easily.There are a varity of guns you can use, and you will eventually find your favurite one.If you become an MLG pro like me, you may get kicked off lobbies for being too good.There are a lot of maps ready to use, most of them really fun.Not many bugs at allCons-Building maps and using the minergun are complicated to understand at first.Empty lobbies with 2 to 3 people can be very boring at times.People leave your lobbies when you take too long messing around with the options.People can join back immediatly after being kicked.

,Recommended,274900,34793465,Posted: 7 September,all,CheekyChan,"Murder Miners is a game I played a bunch of on Xbox 360. Why? Because it's fun and it feels like Halo. But why did I play this and not just Halo even though I own every Halo game made and it's DLC? Because, Murder Miners does a really good job of combining two really good aspects of both the games it takes inspiration from. I bought this game nearly day one when it hit PC because I liked it on Xbox so much though it's not like $1 is much.It's got a little bit of everything when it comes to a shooter and while the game may seem basic it packs a lot of fun. I find it most closely related to Halo CE and while it does hold some similarities to Minecraft with it's voxelness I'd say it's almost nothing like Minecraft. You can build maps with a ""miner weapon"" but that's where the similarities end. The rest basically plays like Halo and that's a good thing considering we don't have enough of Halo on PC.I didn't play competitive a whole lot, most of my time was spent on Zombie Survival messing around with friends. Also, the Hook Shot adds a really cool touch to the game, being able to zip around from building to building is pretty fun.The game is pretty basic when it comes to PC specific options as well. It has full rebindable keys and X360 controller support but video options are basically Vsync, Fullscreen In Desktop Resolution, Super Sampling, Fog Distance and Windowed Mode plus choice of resolutions. That's about it but it's fine because the game still looks great and plays great, there's an internal 60FPS lock even with Vsync disabled but the game plays silky smooth. Game also has Workshop support for user made maps.I see a lot of random people down voting the game with generic responses like ""Terrible game."" and ""why?"" but I honestly don't know why. It's a really polished game for the dollar it costs and provides hours of fun. The game is exactly what it says on the tin as well so I don't see how anyone could feel like they were lied to or how they justify leaving a negative review without at least talking about the negatives. Devs are also super nice and engaging so that's a huge plus.I say; do yourself a favor and pick this game up, get the four pack and play with some friends, even co-op Zombie Survival, if you like Halo, you'll like this game. Now go have some fun."

My friends started it up and we played and couldn't stop, it is really fun, and I really don't like FPS, my personal opinion, this is better than any of the COD games after COD MW2, and this is about as good as Halo 3 or Halo 2. I was really surprised at how enjoyable the game is, and I can't say that i regret buying it, I even went on to buy like 4 or 5 more copies after I bought the 4 pack, then got some more friends to buy it. I'm trying to get my friends to play a huge free-for-all. A couple things that I would Change however, is the game privacy system, and I would see about adding more weapons and adjusting the zombies a bit. My favorite thing is that my understanding is that the developers are a small group of friends and they came together to make a cool little game, which is what I have wanted to do for a very long time. I think the major companies take away a lot of the glory that little indie companies or groups don't get.In short, I love the game, and it is on my list of top 5 favorite shooters.It is like cocaine, you will get hooked, the only difference is that it isn't gonna kill you, unless you are in the game, if that is the case then you should think about respawning."

,Recommended,274900,24140965,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Woke Santa,"Before i jump into things im gonna go ahead and say that this game has a pretty great concept and decent delivery. For the price it is definitely worth it.To start off, the gameplay essentially goes like this.You can pick two weapons before you spawn, with a fairly decent selection although if you want to build anything you will have to select the miner gun as one of them, which is almost useless for attacking. You are then spawned into an arena with other players made up of tiny little bricks which can be destroyed, or built on with bricks of your own. The combat is fairly skill based, while still being somewhat friendly to new players, and if you haven't gotten very good at the game yet you will get killed alot, but will likely still have enough moments where you pull off an awesome stunt to make it enjoyable.The game does give you the ability to build with the minergun, but i find that there isn't really enough of a focus on construction especiallly in the deathmatch mode to really make it worth your time. Not to say it can't be fun to build up a base, but the gameplay is so fast paced that you will likely be killed alot by the other players/zombies while trying to do so.One thing that is worth mentioning is that i believe this game was originally designed for the Xbox, and then ported over to the PC, so if your playing on the PC the gameplay can feel pretty ""klunky"" at times and just generally unsatisfactory.The graphics are nothing special, but they are pretty good for what they are. I especially like the ability to customize your characters colours and helmet.Listening for the sounds that other players are making can be helpfull sometimes, but can also just confuse you too, since you there is almost no difference between a sound made all the way across the map and a sound that is 30 feet away from you. It only really starts to get louder if a player is closer than about 25 feet to you.I have heard people say that there aren't enough players on this game, which is understandable considering that this game is very old. However, although i would certainly like to see more people online and hosting games, i have never personally been completely unable to find someone to play with. Especially since my computer is good enough to host games without serious lag issues. However, especially if your computer can't host games, this might be something you want to consider. (By the way the process for hosting a server is easy, no port forwarding or anything.)Overall, i give this game a 6.5 out of 10. This game is nowhere near perfect, but it can still be a good load of fun to play especially if you've got a couple of friends to play it with. And considering the insanely cheap price, i would say it is well worth your money."

Murder Miners takes two great features of two great games and puts them together rather nicely. Combat feels exciting, construction feels easy and versatile. It's rather impressive how well things work when these two features have taken years on their own to perfect. Now, putting them together, it's almost unbelievable a development team could join them into one production in such a proficient manner. This is defintely a game worth picking up if you like either of these things.For instance, if you prefer construction, you can jump into survival (PvE) or infected (PvP) games and build barricades against a zombie onslaught. If that's not your thing, jump into the standard PvP section that still allows for some construction, but is mostly geared towrads blowing your enemies brains out. There's something for everyone here.Now, in regards to AI, it can be really stupid sometimes. They'll get really dumb at ladders, soemtimes run into walls, and a few other really dumb things that make the zombie survival a lot easier. However, once a zombie gets you, it's basically over. Not to mention, Zombies are pretty dumb already. I guess this could be a pass, but AI is still bad AI.Sound: 7/10Sound FX are decent, music is pretty good. The whole thing is rather fresh on the rotten meter. It's all sufficient enough to make for an engaging experience, but it's not all that varied in regards to general world interaction, guns, and zombie effects. Either way, it works.Graphics:6/10Standard indie retro feel. That, mixed with the blocky emulation of Minecraft, make for something that could turn many people off. However, for those who don't mind that, it's a pretty good set-up that works on the lowest grade potato computers. Some optimization issues may cause a little bit of lag at times, but that's a matter of it being ported from Xbox 360's Indie Game shelf. At this point, the game should be running fine. So many updates, and future plans for a sequel, this is definitely one company that's fun to support. They know how to make a good product and keep at it.Also, to make one more mention on the art, the skyboxes look great.Enjoyment:7/10Pretty dang fun. I've played more hours on Xbox than on PC, but I plan on putting more hours in on this sucker. It's a lot of fun, and especially fun when playing with friends.

Really scratches the Halo itch for anyone (such as myself) who is unwilling to hunt down a cheap copy of the original Halo or pay $20 for it. Game modes, from the zombie mode to the deathmatch, also heavily reference Halo (haven't seen Grifball yet, though).What the developers lack in imagination they've more than make up for in execution, as the gameplay is intensely fun. Playing as a zombie in zombie mode is about the only exception to the fun, as it often takes a full swarm of zombies to overwhelm a single player (if that player can find a high-up spot with open views on all sides, that is). The game is currently Multiplayer only, so purchase with caution as the longevity isn't guarenteed.Gameplay:http://youtu.be/sEbn8ceaDwg"

,Recommended,274900,25681865,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,Lucifer Alpha [MDI],"A seemingly simplistic yet fantastic game. It's main appeal is the easy stage creation which basically feels like everything a Lego game should be. (Don't kill me Minecraft fanbase. I'd rather die at the hands of someone less then 20 years younger then me).The actual gameplay is simple enough to not have the many overcomplicated woes of modern FPS games, yet the appeal of the late 90s deathmatch games. Also, hookshots for us Bionic Commando fans. All 5 of us.Its almost impossible to play a match of this game and not laugh for one reason or another. Either you're killing some adorable little soldier in some explosive manner resulting in their body flying followed by a cartoonish SPLAT effect, sniping their head off followed by blood gushing out, or just having an insane match with dozens of users with an odd number of asterisks in their usernames.The best and worst social aspect of this game is the community. The users range from really fun to play with and lighthearted, to your typical ""THIS MAP SUCKS/YOU GUYS ARE CHEAP"" type players who are usually the ones with 0 points. There aren't usually that many active servers, and there are even days where there will be just one game active, usually some bland textureless map with only pistols and swords enabled *Shudder* and everybody taking the game way too seriously. However, if you do start a server people WILL join. It can take 30 minutes or 20 seconds, but they will all flock in simultaneously.If you buy this game, have a few matches to get used to it, but make sure to create some stages as well. The most relaxing thing in the world is to spend hours just making an awesome map."

I'm sure this game will evolve into (and surpass) the beast it was on the 360 as the community grows larger but for now, it has a very small player base. Aside from that, Murder Miners is definately worth it's humble price. The gamplay is perfect for Halo and Minecraft fans alike (but more so for Halo fans) and the creative maps and remakes should to attract an even wider audiance....eventually.

I mean, 5 USD for 4 copies of a game to play with friends? I mean, even a bad game would seem kinda reasonable at that price range to some. Well, I expected Ace of Spades, with zombies and instead I got a game that felt more like Quake in terms of mobility and competitive gameplay. The gamemodes are plentiful, with around 10 of them available. There are literally hundreds of maps, and that's not including the maps available from the workshop. So, for 2 dollars for one copy and 5 dollars for 4 copies, I see a great multiplayer indie game that runs well, is quite fun and is incredibly cheap for what you get. This is a rare bargain for steam. Games like these can sell for 10 dollars normally, but this price is such a steal. Too bad it wasn't frontpaged or anything, it's kind of hidden away on the store as a reward for those who find it. There were only about 3 servers when I last played, which shows that the servers have died out quite a bit since last year when the game just came out. It's still worth getting the 4 pack and playing with friends. It was a great deal for the price and a fun Quake feeling game.TLDR: IT'S A GOOD GAME FOR THE INCREDIBLY LOW PRICE"

Well, I'm going to write a long one again.Here are some cons:1) The (annoying) players I have encountered are either; nerds that spent way too much time perfecting their sniping skills then spam the comments with annoying text (360NOSCOPE FaZe newb buttcheeks la la la *insert curse words*) or total noobs that get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off when you beat them fair and square claiming that you cheated then go put themselves at an advantage. (have vehicles put at their spawn... ONLY at their spawn. -.- team against you in murdermatch, unlimited ammo only on their team plus speed increase, etc.)2) The. lag. is. real. I'm talking players teleporting and AIs randomly spawning then immediately dying. (happened a couple times to me but maybe it was just hackers. To all you hackers, go back to call of duty. :p)3) Graphics are as poor as minecraft. (i dislike 8-bit, messes with my eyes especially since i play for quite a while) Ugh. My eyes.4) Vehicles. It's not really fun when everyone just depends on Murderbike or Murdership to kill each other. Gets really boring quick...Here are some pros:1) You can hide (transform into the blocks with shotgun) and watch the people struggle to find you. I literally just got out of a game where after I won two rounds of 25 pts. then I hid and watched them struggle to find me xD They were seriously teaming, side by side and won't even shoot each other. Like come on, I'm fine with you spamming me with grenades but this is PvE. Jerks.2) Joys of making new friends. :)3) I'm not the person who would go for FPS but I quite enjoyed actually being exceptionally good. Also, great for if you want to improve yourself with sniper. (No sniper clan for me though, cqc ftw.)4) It's Halo mixed with Minecraft. Oh joy.So yeah, I guess I recommend but if you are as competitive as me you'll be raging after your first couple of games.

A FPS that combines elements of Halo with Minecraft, this game contains single player and online mulitplayer. This game was also my first indie game purchase, and opened the door to indies for me. So yeah, except bias. The game is mainly and most notably built for online play, although it does contain single player, the single player consists of mainly fighting zombie NPCs until you reach the score limit, in which case you win. Murder Miners's online play is where it truly shines. The gun play in Murder Miners is basic, but has its own simple charm. A good example of this is my own playstyle(#selfpromotion!) . Rush in towards an enemy, use a shotgun, and ram them, then fire the shotgun. If they're unprepared, they'll die instantly; if they're prepared, they'll use the sword and dodge you by flying overhead, in which case you're dead.Now the servers are usually unpopulated besides two or three servers, but on weekend play dates the devs hop on and so do other players, usually causing quite a few servers to pop up.So, do I recommend this game?

Most of these games were shameless and mediocre rip-offs of Minecraft. Murder Miners, on the other hand, offered something completely different.First and foremost, this game is the lovechild of Halo and Minecraft which means several things:-The game has both the addictive creativity of Minecraft and the action-packed fast-paced fun of Halo.-The game has both the ceaseless griefers of Minecraft and the immature rage-kickers of Halo.There are a few flaws with this game, with an annoying community that can result in haphazard gameplay being one of them. Another issue is the low fps rate and serious lag in larger servers (someone could join a normal server and it can suddenly become almost unplayable). The controls also can get a bit awkward at times... it was easier to build on the Xbox version and the mining gun can get very tedious.However, the game is still a great game (and needs more players). It may come across as a novelty but for its $2.00 price tag, it has tons and tons of lasting value. The environment is completely destructible and modifiable, leading to a lot of unique strategies. The gameplay, while not diverse, has a nice variety ranging from capture the flag to zombie survival. Most importantly, it's just a fun game and honestly one of the best indie purchases one could make... it's $2.00 and >200 mb and yet manages to deliver a lot in its simple packaging.

It's fast paced, high damage and the building and destroying slips into the gameplay seamlessly. It doesn't feel like they tried to rip off minecraft, it just works. There are a ton of cool maps and you can make your own as well as downloading community maps. You have standard death match and capture the flag but also infection and a zombie survival mode which are very fun. The game is surprisingly immersive and addicting. Destructible environments open up tons of possibilities such as destroying stairs below you or blowing the cover off a vent to crawl through. You can also build houses bunkers and towers which will aid you in survival but can be destroyed. There are a few vehicles, some fairly nice character customization, and the game costs $2.. Not even on sale.. Just $2. It's amazing with friends and even solo against zombies. Highly recommend grabbing it"

Making the maps I want is so easy in this game, although it becomes an actual project when you want to make a balanced map with great flow. It is actually surprising that for a shooting game, the casual players and dedicated community members don't have that locker room behavior which you find in other shooting games the moment you join a server.Obviously, this is a game best played with friends but never be shy to make new ones for the sole purpose of just playing this game."

This game is a shining example of what multiplayer games should be. No annoying progression system, no dlc or microtransactions, no 12 year olds ♥♥♥♥ing your mother (usually), just fun in its purest form, and for only $2 as well! I can't say anything about the standard competitive gamemodes in this game, as I've basically never played them, but I can definitely speak for infection. Infection is one of the most craziest, chaotic, and fun gamemodes I've ever played. One person starts out as the infected and their objective is to kill all of the survivors. When a survivor is killed, they also become infected. This keeps going until there is only one person left fending off a horde of infected, and eventually they are killed and the game is over. There are settings you can mess around with as well if you're hosting, such as giving the survivors infinite ammo (I totally recommend doing this, as the grenade spam that ensues is hilarious). This game also comes with an in-game map editor that is extremely easy to use and allows you to publish to the steam workshop as well. The devs are very community-orientated and host community playdates every Wednesday, which are hectic and fun as hell! The main reason I haven't played in a while though is because I'm in college now, but believe if I had more time (and my friends had more time) I would be playing the hell out of this game!Pros-----+ Infection is a god-tier gamemode+ No progression system, so you can enjoy the full game from the start+ No DLC or microtransactions (it's sad that this is a pro nowadays)+ In-game map editor that can be used alone or with friends+ AMAZING community-made maps+ Awesome devs who clearly care about the game and the community+ Other gamemodes such as TDM and CTF (which are still great and use community maps, I just prefer infection)+ The goddamn hookshot makes the game a lot more fun that it already was+ It's only 2 ♥♥♥♥ing dollarsCons------ There are none. It's offensive that you even think there would be.Overall score: 11/10 (God-tier perfection)Seriously, do yourself a favor and buy the 4 pack, get 3 of your best friends, and have the time of your life.( Also, the hype is real for Murder Miners X )"

76561198046166592,Recommended,274900,12747138,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,Cheffy,"Ok, before I start, THIS IS NOT A MINECRAFT CLONE. Secondly, I have been playing this game since 2 weeks after it's debut on the Xbox Live Indie Games section. After all my experience with it after its beta stage up until the newest update, I can say it still is an amazing game. In fact, this game is what got me interested in Halo, I had never played Halo properly before then.So what is Murder Miners? It's essentially FPS inspired by the gameplay of Halo with the graphics of Minecraft. In fact, that's all it has to do with Minecraft. Now onto the gameplay. The weapons included (the main ones being the Pistol, Machinegun, Shotgun, Sniper and Battle Rifle) play pretty much the same as their Halo counterparts, particularly Halo: CE because of the 3-headshot-kill Pistol. This will appeal to Halo fans but also most FPS fans as a whole because they are just so balanced. However, movement I find is quite unique. Yes there is Halo jumping, but there are also pretty nice mechanics including wall-jumping, multi-directional dashing and unlimited sprint, which I feel pretty much allow you to be a ninja.While what I have metioned so far describe this as a competitive shooter (which it is), it also has a great casual side. The main part of this being infection mode. This is my favourite mode in MM, as I feel it is the best infection mode out of any FPS game I played, as the zombies are not underpowered as they have a grappling tounge to move across the map quickly, and are able to devour corpses to level up.Another great thing about murder miners is the map creation. Now I'm not too into map-making myself, but the game's Minergun allows you to place and destroy blocks with different modes. These options allow you to make maps pretty much any way you want. It's also really easy to use so map-making won't be too complicated, although it can take a while depending on what sort of map you want to make.Are there any bad points about Murder Miners? Well, not too much. The only real thing I have a problem with is that when playing with a lot of people (particularly 18+ people) the game can tend to lag a bit. However, I have an i3, so it could just be me, but I have also seen this problem on the Xbox version. But thankfully this doesn't happen too much. Another thing to mention is that JForce are really involved with their community and respond to any suggestions or complaints they may have. Also updates used to be very frequent last year (pretty much every month), but are kind of slow at the moment, but this is due to the big vehicle update late last year and with porting the game to PC.

Personally i enoyed the game but i fall into the sneaky basturd sniper catagory so go figure, Make sure you play with friends you can voice chat with, and have the zombies on, you'll get a kick out of the rage that occurs afterwards xD"

Especially the zombie survival mode where you would try and hold off against increasingly difficult waves of zombies until you eventually fell.Now this version on the PC is even better! With vehicles, two more weapons, and a great community of maps to choose from! What's great about this game is that you can make your own maps and upload them to the steam workshop for people to download and mess around with.Speaking of community the devs are doing everything they can to bring more players to the game. Even going as far as 81% discounts and selling 4 packs for only 2.89$. It is extremely easy to play with friends or huge battles with over 10 players. Although those often just become insane sniper fights.The game plays a lot like a halo game would with the ""OP"" pistol, battle rifles, snipers, along with a couple extra fun guns to work with like mineguns to place blocks with and hookshots to fly around the map with. And most of the weapons have extra abilities like the machine gun that empties the whole clip in a second and the minegun that fires a huge blast of energy at your enemies.Some might look at the game and think ""Er mah gurd! de grafics lurk leik meincwaft!"" but the blocks make it awesome to build zombie survival forts in or to recreate your favorite Counter Strike map with.In the zombie mode you can play as the zombies and join the hordes taking out the survivors or be the lone alpha zombie and scare your friends silly. The zombies have the ability to break through walls, lunge at survivors, or even use their tongues like a smoker from L4D and drag them straight to your bloody claws.Absolutely would recommend buying this game. And if you have a friend or two you should absolutely buy the 4-Pack to have hours of fun playing with. (Even though I only have 5 hours on my record I have played this like crazy on the xbox.)"

Soon after, I narrowly escaped a horde of zombies on my hoverbike before accidentally running it off a cliff. Later, I pulled a guy out of a helicopter using my newly-grown zombie tentacles and ate him.That was my first hour playing this game, so yeah, I would say I got my $2 worth almost immediately.This game looks silly, and it definitely is. But the gameplay is solid, with lots of variation and fun to be had. Gunplay is very similar to the original Halo, with community maps and gamemodes that exceed the scope of any FPS I've played before. The simple, 90's era graphics might be a turn off for some, but they really allow the gameplay to flourish in ways big studio FPS games rarely do. Maps can be massive in scale, vertically and horizontally. The community created maps range from entirely original, unique concepts, to faithful recreations of classic FPS maps (the other day I was playing CTF on Halo's Blood Gulch and Zombie mode on Goldeneye's Complex). The rudimentary graphics also mean the game runs as smooth as butter, with no latency or framerate issues to speak of.In short, this game is immediately fun, excellently conceived and executed, and is a great value at only $2.

The map remakes are done pretty well and actually feel similar to the real deal you would find in Halo and COD. Brings me back to middle school when I was an Xbox pleb.Biggest problem with this game is the lack of a steady playerbase.

If you obliterate people on the PC with superior mouse and keyboard skills, you'll be kicked by sweaty 12 year old children who still somehow use the Xbox 360 controller because (coughAIMASSISTcough).2. If you join a game that has one slot remaining, you feel you've accomplished something after you've got kicked by that one person who doesn't know how to make a server password-protected.3. When playing the zombies mode, you'll find out that virtually every gun you're good with is replaced by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ minergun. Seriously, who even likes that thing, save from the ability to build walls?Honestly, overall this game is actually surprisingly decent. Aside it from being a living meme by some people, for 79p you get Murder Miners on PC - which far outweighs its Xbox 360 counterpart.

The community is alright and although the servers are usually somewhat empty it's not too hard to find a match. The visuals are simple yet effective and the guns feel alright. However, the sniper feels unbalanced, and sometimes it is a little buggy and relatively unoptomized. A great thing about the game is that there is no option to purchase in-game cosmetics and your character is fully customizable without need to by anything. My biggest complaint is the lack of options involving zombies and the lack of some options in general.TL;DRHalo with Minecraft elements, def. worth the dollar it costs.

So I thought: Oh, it looks interesting and price isn't too high!What I was expecting: that this game would be ideal fusion of L4D and Ace of Spades.Were these expections met?It's hard to say. Main part of this game is zombie slashing. That was done not bad, but I'm not about to say that it was done perfect. AI of zombies is - literally - stupid. They can be running into the wall for hours,days,months, they coulda make some families and live happily ever afte... stop, they couldn't. They just go into the freakin' wall and do nothing at all. After that they die :(On the other hand, as far as I'm concerned, they are incredibly strong and could kill ya with 2 strikes.So, in my point of view, zombies aren't too hot in the game. What about positive features?First of all, there's not a big quantity, but there's a huge range of weapons and they differ from each other: pistol for accurate players, shotgun for crazy ones who are to get close and tear enemy apart, and etc. So, you will say: Hey, these weapons are not interesting. We can see them in every game!So, Is there a lot of games where you are able to get hookshot, jump on the top of map, get your sniper and smash all the heads that are to kick you hell outta there? And are there games where you could cut off the shoulders 5-10 heads of enemies with your mega-sword and get to the big hill with impulse of it's strike?Also, there's a mine gun. It's interesting, but I'm inclined to believe that it's not THE BEST MINEGUN EVER.By the way, game give us an opportunity to play with no zombies and just create a big dash on some map with lots of people. So.... sometimes it's really possible to find a deathmatch lobby, but in most cases it's not.Anyway, game let us destroy all the map with weapons, grenades, cyber-bikes and mega-helicopters with 3 places for all of your buddies. It's not a big problem to destroy city that was created by a teenager from Wisconsin.So, I was about to forget. There's a workshop here and it really works (personally my client didn't want to download maps but I'm sure it's just a bug or error of my PC, now it's OK) There we can download some maps to have more fun.Feel free to customize your model with new helmets, new colours of armour and - even - special colours of electricalspriteseffects.Main flaw of the game is little maps so don't expect the game would be a minecrafted and L4D-ed analogue of BF3 (and even BF2 :-( )So, let's be clear and brief: MM is not TOO cool game, but if you buy it feel pacient cause it's not bad and it's about to interest you... or you won't fell that you just wasted your last money to buy this game... I hope so =)And, it's popular to esteemate game by ten-point scale. So, my mark is 7/10Thanx everybody who has read this huge piece of cake that is named review :D(A minute of self-criticism? Why not? %))"

It's a solid shooter, it's got map building, and character customisation, what more could I want?Well, the servers seemed a little sparse, but you guys don't control who plays and when.I just dunno.All in all, it's pretty good, and plays like old arena shooters when you really get into it, so that's a plus.7/10Glad I bought it, and it's still better than most AAA shooters being pumped out these days."

The people on the server were very friendly and cooperative. My teammates listened to what I had to say and were supportive of my ideas. I got bored and actually made a tunnel that went behind the other team's base so that we could take their flag and they wouldn't even know. My teammates and I took advantage of my idea and made it bigger and more discreet, and not a single person found out about it on the other team.Even though the people are fantastic and friendly, there definitely is a lack of people playing the game. Servers were at a minimum- there were only 2 servers available and the server I was on only had 6/15 people at the time before it stacked up. What I noticed was, lots of people in the chat were saying,""Wow, I've never seen a server with this many people before."" which is a not a good sign for the game having full servers.If you're wondering about the gameplay, it's almost near exact to Halo and Minecraft- except you can't starve and♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm personally not a fan of this game style because I don't exactly play Halo and Minecraft that much anymore. Anyways, combat seems fluid and you can get kills easy enough.Definitely get this game when it's on sale, though. I only paid $0.99 for my copy instead of the $4.99 price tag. I think the price I paid is definitely a good price to pay considering the game is near-death in it's servers. Only 3 out of my 114 friends play this game, so zombie mode isn't really going to happen.Overall, the game is nice and fluid, but the developers could have definitely worked harder on it. 7/10"

The one complaint I have is, why does the game say it has to send maps to other players even though it's a default map? It actually seems to cause lag when it pops up. Not only that, but when other players are lagging it seems to affect the rest of the players on the server. Is there any way to control what Region can play on your game? Just a thought. Outside of that, it was pretty fun to play. I don't know what to rate this really. Because it's not really a yes or a no for me, more like a maybe. Reason for this being the lag issues. Some maps are also non destructable. I think every map should, and you should be able to blow off parts of the map. That would be cool!Anyways, I'll give it a yes for now, but barely."

From the inspiration of Halo's combat system gunplay feels great and doesn’t get boring at all I spend hours just building maps and playing with my friends and you could do the same because I got 4 copy’s for 1$ on sale id say that’s the best time to get it to play with your buds but the price right now is phenomenal. Giant battles hosted by Developers every Wednesday and plenty game modes such asMurdermatchTeam MurdermatchMurder the flagZombie survivalInfectionAnd more, this game has so much to offer and will get you hooked from its unique mechanics.Under fire? build cover or a base to protect yourself temporarily but be aware the environments are 100% destructible from the ground to the buildings by grenades or just blunt force, certain materials have certain strength to damage, so choose wisely. Zombies has the same aspect and is the most fun I’ve had since CoD zombies. Start off in an abandoned ship with your choice of weaponry whether it would be a rifle and pistol to a shotgun and miner gun each with different strengths and abilities. You will try to find a room to turtle in and block the entrance with your miner gun using what little time you have before you hear the zombies tunneling throughout the walls and slowly getting closer finally breaking in and trying to infect you.Loads of fun hours on end totally recommend this game to anyone and to be honest the price is very generous for the games quality.

Recently there was a sale on the 4 pack of the game, making it cheaper than the single pack to boost the player count, and is one of the few good devs left on steam, post greenlight.Overall I think the game is very good, and deserves more love and attention from the community : 7.5 out of 10!"

After spending 50 cents on it, however, it doesn't exactly live up to it.First off, the character creator. I watched the preview and honest-to-god couldn't change anything except the helmet and colors. It has creative potential, but not completely.Next is the player amount. I'm suprised how low it is, actually. I played on the weekend and even at the most popular time barely anyone played. Makes me wonder about the reviews....The maps. Too much ""parkour"" maps, people. This is an fps, not some ROBLOX runner or csgo surf.Gameplay. The movement needs adjusting at first, but it is like Halo: CE. Pretty good, and probably the game's redeeming quality.Weapons. I spammed the sword and it kicks ###. One shot kills next to sniper. Pretty unbalanced if you ask me.Graphics. Everything is in a grid. Like they forgot to take that off for the game building or something. Average for an indie, if you ask me.Zombies. SUCKS. Two shot zombies are op, not to mention the fact NOBODY PLAYS INFECTED. Waste of time.Publisher interaction. It's pretty good, with weekly participation. At least they spend time in their own creation.Overall, this game is a timekiller, but not something to invest too much time in. Worth the 50 cents, however.

,Recommended,274900,34130233,Posted: 9 August,all,DeadlestSpartan,"So here is the simple review for this game or here is the link to the video review and giveaway.Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCtOVQldpzIWelcome to the DeadlestSpartanGroup.Today I'll be reviewing Murder Miners as well as giving away 2 copies of the game.If you want a chance to win one of those copies stay tuned throughout the video.Murder Miners is a PC port from Xbox 360 Indie Games so I will do some comparisons. XXXXXXXXXAlso the developers are working on Murder Miners X so I will be saying some wishes and/or things that I think that would be cool to see.First thing is the character creator which is neat, but limited since all you can change is the helmet and colors. While there is not too many helmet choices it stillfeels cool to make your character since you have a nice pallet of colors to choose from. You color the armor in parts adding to that custom armor just a litle bit.Hopefully Muder Miners X will add more helmets and add in Body armor customization to allow people to feel like it's there own character a little more.Next lets check out Options. You are able to customize your controls, aim setting, and turn on or off the xbox button icons.You can also customize your armor from here so if you want to change your helmet or colors here you go. Graphics Options allows you to turn on or offSuper Sampling which when on can hurt framerate on big detailed levels. You also have Blood Particles, Fog Distance, and Vsync along with Window Optionswhich are Fullscreen, Windowed Borderless Monitor Resolution, and Windowed Game Resolution. Lastly we have Volume, music, credits, and debug options.The settings feel small, but it is at least an easy to run game. Since they are using Unity for Muder Miners X we might be seeing custom resolutionswhen it comes out.Now lets talk about the different gamemodes it has. First up is Mudermatch which is a simple free for all with up to 30 players, chaos is sure to follow.Next is Team Mudermatch which is...well Team Deathmatch so nothing new there. After that is Murder the Flag or otherwise known as Capture the Flag, but whenyou capture the flag it is murdered then starts spewing out blood which is a nice touch. Now we come to the 2 modes I like to play which is Infection and Zombie Survival.Infection being like halo's, but the zombies have grapling tentecles to help them. Zombie Survival is you and up to 7 friends working as a team or solo tofight the horde of undead. To have even more fun combine the 2 modes so when you die you become a zombie and kill your friends. Last two modes are Yolo Modewhich is murdermatch with one life and Map Making Mode. The Map Making is cool. first, you can make the map by setting its width, depth, and height. Decide thefloor type, floor height, the type of terrain being hill or flat, and then getting to work on it. I was lost at first trying to learn how to set spawns and weaponspawns since I didn't look it up, but it is simple once you know. It just takes a little of getting used to. Let's hope Muder Miners X adds in more to do.On another note while I haven't seen it on PC version cause I haven't gone to acutally look, but it should be on here, is hide and go seek which is a lot offun to play.Lastly is the weapons and gameplay itself. The game has 9 weapons with them being Pistol, Shotgun, Machine Gun, Sniper Rifle, Miner Gun, Hookshot, Energy Sword,OP Sniper, and Battle Rifle. Some having an extra abillity such as right click on shotgun activates cammoflauge which makes you appears as a stack of blocksyour standing on. There are also Frag Grenades and Sticky Grenades. As for the Gameplay it's basically Halo with Blocks which is what it's suppose to be likesince that's what they were going for. So I just hope we see a ton more weapons and personallize the gameplay a little more in Murder Miners X."

The reviews for this game suggest that it is some sort of amazing FPS experience.  It is not a complex experience.  A bunch of people spawn on a map, and you run around with a couple weapons trying to kill eachother.  Some people talk about how this is very much not like minecraft.  I'll agree that the goal is very different from minecraft.  The graphics (obviously) are similar.  The digging and placing blocks is very similar to minecraft, and is an annoying addition to this game.  I felt like half the time I was digging around trying to find the last player on infection mode, because they had dug into a strange place where nobody could find them.  Perhaps they placed some blocks to make it even harder to get at them.This game doesn't do anything seriously wrong.  However, it also doesn't have the degree of depth that I was expecting after reading the reviews and looking at the steam store page.  I'm not recommending mostly because of how I feel I was tricked into believing it was something it isn't."

Unfortunately, my career as a murder miner was cut short by Thatcher in the 80s, when she decided to switch Britain's focus to Murder Oil, so I'm glad to have found a game which can accurately represent the feelings I used to get when I hookshotted into someone and then used a sword to slice their bloody head off.Many would say that it's a shame that the community for this game is so starved of life; however, I view this as a positive, as it means I've developed an intense friendship with the other fifty or so players. This game is the single greatest video game in history, if The Louvre displayed digital content, they'd tear down the Mona Lisa and replace it with a montage of my sick hookshot combos.For real, in all sincerity, buy Murder Miners now, and buy another copy for your friend, and two more for your dad and mum, the total price of which is less than a Subway sandwitch. That doesn't seem too pricy for literally unlimited enjoyment.On an unrelated note, I am recently unemployed, and if the team at Murder Miners would like to hire me to write about the lore of this storied and fabled game, they should.Buy Murder Miners right now, and get good for the pro-am tournament at ESL Cologne 2016.Thanks, Thatcher, you heartless cow."

But in Murder Miners, there is no real plot (if there is its vague and stupid) 12 year olds and girls pretty much give up on playing like normal human beings. There is no character development… like non at all, you see no ones past and therefore i had no connection to any character and wouldn’t have been sad or mad if any died. The best episodes were the god damn training filler episodes. You know an anime is bad when the filler episodes are better than the actual “storyline” in this case. The only thing redeeming about Murder Miners is it has 2 of the best openings I’ve every heard. Its not dramatic when it tries to be. there are times where it is literally 30 seconds of just getting kicked from a lobby, just to waste time. The god damn alfheim arc was better than all of Murder Miners and I’ve seen Murder Miners twice, sub and dub and both times it was just god awful, so props to you if you can actually stomach it, but overall it deserves a 4/10 would not 9/11 again."

The impact left a gaping, burning hole near the 80th floor of the 110-story skyscraper, instantly killing hundreds of people and trapping hundreds more in higher floors. As the evacuation of the tower and its twin got underway, television cameras broadcasted live images of what initially appeared to be a freak accident. Then, 18 minutes after the first plane hit, a second Boeing 767–United Airlines Flight 175–appeared out of the sky, turned sharply toward the World Trade Center and sliced into the south tower near the 60th floor. The collision caused a massive explosion that showered burning debris over surrounding buildings and the streets below. America was under attack."

To me it doesn't really feel like minecraft, the art style may look similar to it but it's not; if you love playing Halo this is the closest you'll get to a Halo experience on pc. But even then, there are some game modes that don't feel like Halo, there is a zombies survival game which can be extremely fun if the host of the game sets it up correctly. Although this game is very fun to play it's pretty much dead, it'd be great to see a massive sale on this game again and see a lot of players on this game once again.

And I bet if you are reading this, you are thinking if you should buy this game, and I will tell you the things you should be aware of when getting this: There is a very low community for this game, so you will usually see people online on weekends. The zombies in the game have very bad AI (may be changed). And now I realized that I can`t think of anything else that is bad about this game unless if you want to count the graphics that look bad, but it doesen`t really matter though, its about the GAMEPLAY! Deathmatch is pretty fun with the variety of unique maps and other maps made by your friends or the host that you are playing with, and same goes with infection mode. But the zombie survival mode doesen`t really work with alot of the maps because of the AI. The weapons are very different exept for the machine gun and the battle rifle which are not very different, but you DO have a ""miner gun"" which lets you break blocks and place blocks, and a ""hook shot"" which lets you grapple to any block you look at, and a lazer sword, which is basically the energy sword from halo. The infection mode is probably the best gamemode, where you play as either the miner or the zombie, as where the zombies can break blocks really fast, and can use a weird tentacle to grapple like the hook shot and the ability to eat bodies to ""level up"" and be a very powerful zombie beast. One thing that reminds me is the level editor, which is not very good, and makes it hard to build a detailed map, or maybe that is just me. And finally, yes, I love this game, it is alot of fun, great to play with friends               and is one of my favorite minecraft clones, i guess, even though this game is pretty much nothing like minecraft, and is more like halo, but whatever, I love it.

This game is fantastic and has definitely made it move from the xbox and onto the pc. Thought it has been uears since I have last played this game on the xbox 360, I have recently purchased this game yet again. I honestly was not disappointed, though the community now a days is pretty small and everyone is awaiting the release of Murder Miners X, it is still a great game to play with your friends. Now honestly no game is perfect and yes besides the countless of MLG Try hards in this game, it is definitely fun to try and create your own custom gamemode and mess around on random maps. For example some friends and I made a type of dodgeball gamemode where the players have nothing but grenades and plasma grenades. We will try and stick each other on diffrent maps and whoever has the most kills wins. Any Type of game mode is easily achieved by messing with player settings and disabling and enabling weapons and such. One thing I never saw though, but I did not necessarily dislike is that there was no campaign. Now that's not really a problem since it is my opinion and I enjoy some games with a good storyline behind it, but the fan base has somewhat covered that. Anyway all in all this game is pretty great and I will give it a 9.5 out of 10!"

One of the best things you can do in this game is get lots of freinds around to make a map or host a server of which ever game mode you please.One thing I didn't really like about the game was the fact that making maps was really hard,the minergun wasn't the sharpest tool for placing blocks.I'm going to play this much much more I still love the game so much, and for the cheap price tag it's insanely worth it.

It is definitely worth the full price, and it's on sale now, too.The map making is done with a tool called the Minergun that works very well for building and destroying things. You can also use it as a weapon on matches. If the match allows it, you can use the minergun to build barricades on the map during a match.Generally, the weapons are very well balanced and different weapons are good for different things. For example, the battle rifle is a great zombie killer because of it's high rate of fire and one-burst kills on zombies as well as an excellent range and good accuracy. However, the battle rifle takes three bursts to the head to kill a normal player, so it isn't very good for matches against other players who are using guns and you might want to use a pistol instead. The shotgun is great at very close range, but the pellets spread out and are less likely to kill a target that is too far away. The sniper rifle is great for long range, but it's slow rate of fire and innacuracy without zooming in makes it a bad weapon for close range.Building your own maps and setting a game up is easy. You can allow all blocks to be destroyed, or you can lock all blocks and allow no blocks to be destroyed or placed. You can even lock specific blocks so that they can't be placed or destroyed, but everything else can.The graphics are simple, but effective, and these simple graphics mean that there is almost no lag at all. There are several different gamemodes: murdermatch, (deathmatch) team murdermatch, (team deathmatch) murder the flag, (capture the flag) Infection and zombie survival. In my opinion, infection is the most fun gamemode because it is very fun to be a zombie and pull players out of the murderships (aircraft that fire meteors) with my tentacle and then infect them.Another great thing about this game is that there are 30 player servers! :DThere are two vehicles:-Murdership: Four players can use this. There is a pilot, who controls the ship and firest the meteors, the other three can sit on both sides of the ship and the back and fire their guns to support everybody else. Sniper rifles and battle rifles work really well for this.-Murderbike: a really fun vehicle to use that can perform jumps and use boosts. it is a hoverbike with two seats and it is very fast. You can even run people over with it. >:D The person on the front controls it, and the person on the back uses their weapons and supports the driver. This vehicle has no attached weapons.The only thing that I dislike about this game is that it can sometimes be a bit glitchy when there is a high number of players, but I definitely think that this game is worth a buy. I hope that my review helps. Thank you for reading."

It doesn't try too hard to be either game.The gameplay is solid, and sometimes it can be frustrating with if the Host disables all building, or enables the block the map is made of to be buildable (which also means destructible) and people start tearing the map apart literally, there's some clunky UI but nothing that ruins the game."

You can upgrade all of your personal rats with a skill tree that was put into the game. But the DEVS take this even further by letting you change your rat's appearence. Overall this game has a very RPG like feel to it.It also has a very advanced multiplayer system in which players are put in a 4v4 arena where only teamwork will prevail. In this mode there are power ups which will let you unleash chaos on your enemies. The game is also very well balanced with multiple maps and gamemodes for multiplayer inluding: Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill, and much more. You can also create clans and play a gamemode called clan battle which puts two clans up in a Team Deathmatch game and the first team t0 50 points wins.The thing that keeps you hooked to the game though is the deep backstory involving the murder of king rat. Who could be behind this? None other than those pesky cats. You play as many different rats from the king rat's family wanting to get revenge for his death. It has a very well developed choice system which can end up altering the game into 43 different endings.There are also very many different classes of rat which you can choose depending on your playstyle. You could be sneaky, ambitious, aggressive, safe, balanced, etc.. The point is the game shapes to how you want to play it.CONSIt's not Half Life 3."

This game is for those that want a cheap but good FPS experience to have for a few hours with some friends. Without friends, you will not be able to play this game, just like Guncraft. The game is like Halo meets Minecraft where Guncraft is more like Minecraft meets Call of Duty. The biggest difference between the two games would be the price tag, this game is underpriced for the sake of trying to grow playerbase activity. There is also talk of a sequel.

I played for a little bit and i was hooked, the 0.3 hours doesnt account for the weeks of nonstop playing. When they added vehicles and capture the flag and all the additional things it was a masterpiece. Most maps are user made and submitted, my favorite being the maps where you are toy-sized and can snipe eachother from afar or fight eachother in the dressers and in the smallest cracks, akin to the bedroom map from blockland if youve played it. I highly suggest purchsing this game, if you want a demo you can check out the demo version on xbox 360 (my suggestion for devs is to add an demo option) all in all everything from the sound design and music, to the retro feeling of the maps and tons of weapons with special abilites you will have some fun playing."

I played the game on xbox for a few years as a young boy. It was pretty funny and making a 1v1 infection match for hide and seek was a good time. As a streamer a game i can make laughs out of is basically worth it. I would be lying if I said I played this game seriously. But for a dollar? Come on man. Its not gonna be Battlefeild 1 XD.

To my surprise I believe it's been well worth that price. If Halo and Minecraft had a baby, this is what you would get. You have the action and combat of halo, the graphics and sandbox building of minecraft all in 1 game. I'll go a little more in depth as always.SANDBOX/BUILDING ASPECT: In murder miners you have a miner gun, this is you use to select blocks, place blocks, delete blocks and just be creative with. Although it's kind of awkward to get used to, it's just very simple which works in a game like this, no need to get too crazy.PVP COMBAT: If you've ever played Halo, you will get the same vibe from Murder miners combat as you do with halo. Although everything can be tweaked by the session host, the jumping, vehicles, gunplay all feels very similar to halo.Can I easily find a match? Depends. On weekends there are more people on, by more I mean like maybe 30-40. You can find a match, but I doubt you will always find your favorite gamemode or map. On top of that, a lot of people will kick you from the  game if you're better than them.Overall for $1 I think it's worth it. You can be creative, you can have exciting combat, you can just have fun. The game is only limited to what you're willing to do with it. Definitely recommend."

It's by no means a beautiful looking game and it's clearly a Halo-Minecraft knockoff but it combines most of the aspects of both games expertly and features a decent soundtrack (what little of it there is) and enjoyable mechanics. Population is near non-existent at best however.

Best part is that it is very low priced, and a lot of new computers would handle it. And, I would say, if it were to hold up to triple A titles of the modern age, it would rank up quite decently. I would give it a 9/10."

You can find games however and have good connection. I do recommend playing with friends though. If you get really good at Murder Miners you should be called a hacker 24/7 and be blacklisted from servers. I go from experience... The Murder Miners community is good, there is more bad though.
