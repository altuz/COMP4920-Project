,Recommended,274920,12022555,"Posted: 8 September, 2014",all,Flutters,"FaceRig is only in early access now, so it does have some flaws, but overall, it's truly awesome. It is professionally made face-tracking software that works just by analyzing your face through your webcam, for a ridiculously low price. It's great for literally anything for which you can use your own face, like Skype, vlogs, livestreams, or to keep your anonymity on infamous websites like Omegle and Chatroulette.What is truly amazing about this is that normally, to achieve the same results as FaceRig achieves, you will need to have either a special suit on or to stick your face full of tracking orbs. FaceRig just analyzes your face through the webcam, and measures all the points of it without all these expensive Hollywood thingos.The flaws are minor ones, like if you have a bad webcam, the program will likely not work as you would expect. If your face is blurry, it won't be able to recognize you. The same problem occurs when you move too fast, but that is the same reason.Sometimes, frowning doesn't completely work, but with the reactions on your friends' faces, I doubt you would ever frown anyway.Things I'm looking forward to: Movement of the arms. If I can have that in here, FaceRig is just perfect."

I just loaded it up with my basic♥♥♥♥♥Logitech C270 webcam and it's up and running out of the box. I didn't have to screw with lighting, heck as I type this it's midnight, the only light is that coming off my monitor, and it STILL works surprisingly well. Have not tried it with glasses yet, though.As far as the quality of the tracking goes, it's far from professional but probably at least $10 worth of fun to record making silly faces or crank calling your Skype friends. The lip synching can be done either from video or from mic input and automatically prioritizes the video if the mic is currently quiet. There's definitely a bit of lag, you're not going to get it to look as good as the guy narrating the trailer, but the lady silently making the faces seems about on par with my experience. The eye tracking is actually really impressive, it picks up my blinking, squinting, and looking around very well.The avatars that seem to work best are the hamburger and Octodad, because when you inhabit the more human ones the odd bits of twitchy tracking stand out far more. And then there's the nightmarishly unappealing furry avatars, this coming from a guy who's OK with furries. Honestly, my biggest gripe about the program at this point is that it doesn't seem to save ANY of the configurations on exit presently. It also has to re-register your neutral face pose anytime it loses a lock on you, resulting in some very skewed neutral expressions sometimes."

My teacher would ask, ""Little Cheshire,"" (distinguishing me from Big Cheshire), ""what do you want to be when you grow up?"" I would happily answer, ""A hamburger! A hamburger on a toasted bun with sesame seeds!"" My teacher would chortle as she answered, ""Why, Little Cheshire! You can't be a hamburger! You have to pick something realistic like a prince or an astronaut!"" Then she would turn, still laughing, to the next child in line who would announce their desire to be a dinosaur cowboy upon reaching adulthood.Despite what my grade school teacher said, I never lost sight of that dream. I would often coat myself in ketchup and mustard, then sprinkle seeds in my hair and stare into the mirror for minutes at a time, willing myself to become a hamburger. However, this bit of role-playing never fulfilled my desire to be a hamburger.Now, now my dream will finally be realized. My first order of business will be to record a video of me as a hamburger and send it to my grade school teacher. I'll say, ""MMmmmMMMMMMM!!!!!"" (For, of course, hamburgers cannot speak English.) She will know instantly who I am, and will type her response as tears of regret roll down her cheeks and onto her keyboard. ""Little Cheshire,"" she will type, ""I was wrong. I was so wrong."" My hamburger self will smile as I read her response, knowing that all the while, I understood that I was right to dream of being a hamburger, most noble of all handheld foods. I will be able to throw away my economy-size bottles of ketchup and mustard, my large jar of sesame seeds, knowing that I have achieved my dream finally."

Wouldn't recommend to wear glasses while using, it makes the eyes of the charicter freak out, but you ca still choose to lock it's eyes on the camera which is what I'd assume you'd want it to do anyways. Other then that it picks up on everything else eyebrow movements, lip and mouth movements, tilts, turns, everything. The girl charicters make more subtle movements so it's harder to see, and I wish it would pick up on the user's more subtle lip movements because I have to exagerate the way my mouth moves from time to time, because I naturally don't open my mouth too wide at all when I talk.

With Facerig I have noticed that you have to open your mouth and widen your eyes as far as possible for it to be able to imitate you on screen, even then it isnt well detected. If you open your mouth wide while you talk and widen your eyes to the craziest look ever then the program will barely open its eyes and move its mouth in small amounts. It might be good to have some lower level form of voice detection also paired with mouth detection, maybe use them in tandem.(on a side not there is a typo on the word ""threshold"" for the camera)pros-play as several funny avatarscool conceptcons-the expac costs more than the productthe facial recognition doesnt work well with beards (not sure if it works without)I have a good idea for you guys also, maybe add an ability to add your own models into the program from some where like Turbo squid.

,Recommended,274920,12061838,"Posted: 11 September, 2014",all,Doggo back 8/10,"-- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW! Current review from 13/09/14 --FaceRig is a program that lets you transcribe your face (over webcam) onto a virtual character on-screen.It works well in the sense that it works well on any webcam. I have a fairly low-end Logitech C270, which is the benchmark to low-mid level webcams, and it works fine. Only very occasionally have I had weird glitches, like the following:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=312617743But they are quickly reset and a more high-end webcam with a better refresh rate shouldn't suffer from this.As shown in the screenshot, I have noticed a few problems with eyelid tracking, in the sense that one of the eyes either never blinks or appears to be half open, giving your character a ""derpy"" look. I don't hold this against the software however as it makes the characters look cute.Speaking of characters, they have a wide range of facial expressions but they seem to be incapable of displaying anger. The most you can do to show frustration is to raise your upper lip over your teeth which gives the impression of growling. This is something that the devs could do to add some major credit in my eyes.It includes the shibe ""Doge"" as well as a anthropomorphised wolf called Danny, etc. There are tons more and you will probably find at least one that you really like. There has already been some modifiability already into the game but it will be some time before furry 3D modellers find this and start making their own models, but I can see a healthy commission market for this ahead.There aren't really any things I can compare FaceRig to; it's utterly unique in its position and it has a very good deal of potential for the future. I hope that the dev team will quickly move to eliminate the remaining bugs and then start adding some of the promised features as shown in the trailer,From 13/09/14 (European dating, obviously) the software already appears to be finished.If you like this, and have a decent webcam, I say go for it!"

Actually, it did factor in.So, shiny new computer tower installed, widescreen monitor, webcam, microphone... everything was ready.Facerig did not disappoint.I was looking for something to create stories on for school, something the kids could take home or be sent to parents over social media, something a little more interesting than an audio recording and it hit that spot straight away.So, I used it on and off until it came to organising a Halloween event for the school. With a little planning and a Skype setup, we arranged it so the students had a locked-room challenge, hosted by a Halloween monster (thanks to one of the DLC packs).Sure, Skype support has been problematic lately, but that's Skype, not the software. Give yourself a half decent webcam, a decent lightsource and remember to keep your expressions animated and this will deliver the goods without fail. It's a great toy and a great resource and when I brought it in for Halloween, my colleagues were perhaps even more impressed than the students.As long as you know what this does and what you're getting yourself in for, then I thoroughly recommend this software.The interface is easy to use and you'll be flying around it quickly enough, the range and resolution of the avatars is superb and the addition of 2D avatars is a neat touch.

I tried it myself and found it rather disappointing (for reasons detailed below), but I still have not changed my mind about the fact that it has a lot of potential. It is a shame because I actually wanted to purchase the Pro license so I could broadcast with FaceRig.- Most facial features (eyebrows, chin, forehead, etc.) on most avatars tend to jitter like crazy, rapidly and haphazardly fluttering even with my face up-close and perfectly still. I have a good camera, and I did try to play around with the ""Smoothing"" options that were designed to get rid of this facial capture anomaly, but to no avail. This may sound like a minor issue, but it really hinders performance when I encounter it. I looked in the website's forums for this issue and found only one other user who had it, and his query is yet to be answered.- Some characters severely lack certain expressions. For example, the ""wisdom"" guy seems to be unable turn (not tilt) his head sideways, except through manual controls.- Sort of related to the above issue: It is very difficult to have a character shake its head ""yes"" or ""no"" without anomalies. For example, the ghost in the Halloween DLC is almost incapable of doing a coherent head shake. He is also unable to nod ""yes"" without his eyebrows erroneously registering a series of scowls and raised brows. This was especially discouraging because I liked this character most.- I noticed some characters completely lacked customization options, such as the aforementioned ghost.It seems to be all these issues may eventually be solved while this software continues to be developed and improved. However, in the state in which it is now, I find it almost unusable at worst, experimental at best. My refund request is pending.If you really like what this software offers and don't care about the technical issues listed above, then I see no reason why you should hold back. However, I personally recommend waiting until it is at least in a better state, especially if you plan on going professional with it."

I'll try my best to clear this up. Also, this is NOT a troll review, I see too many of those, and it worries me that people won't get an honest review.Face tracking works about 90% of the time, as long as you set up your camera in a very precise way, either directly below your monitor in the center, or directly above your monitor at eye level in the center. I feel like people are giving this software bad reviews because they do not take the time to adjust the camera to a precise way, (Which to me is a small price to pay to experience this next generation software) and even so, it still is in beta.NOTE: I would also like to say that this doesn't require some fancy camera to track your facial expressions and body movements precisely, I have a 10$ 2MP autofocus Logitec camera, and the tracking works perfectly, if, like i said before, the camera is in the right angle. Also, it is very sensitive when it comes to blurriness, if your webcame is blurry it will NOT, let me emphasize, NOT pick up your movement and facial features.The details in FaceRig are very noticable, the standard backgrounds are fitting with the character models offered, such as a lava baron in a Volcano, dragon on a mountaintop etc... You can also upload your own backrgrounds.You can surprise your friends on skype, omeagle, and such with facerig, however it is semi-complicated to do so at the moment, but it is still possible, and to me, very much worth it.If you are having trouble with facerig and skype, here is a tutorial on how to use skype with facerighttp://steamcommunity.com/app/274920/discussions/0/34096318834663165/The customization in FaceRig is still under development, but it is still existant. There are also customizations that have already been ""grouped"" by the facerig team, like instead of Danny (A wolf with clothing) having a brown jacket and a red bandana, there are presets that you can choose to make him have a white bandana and a black jacket.NOTE: You can upload your own models, but the facerig team has stated that it is almost unususable at the moment, but like i said, still in beta. Also, if you customize the character you are playing as, it will not save when you close out and re-launch FaceRig!Overall: Great potential, good tracking, and great customization features. 9/10, was very satisfied with the results; I highly reccomend this to anyone with a cameraEDIT: People with glasses, purchase with caution; doesn't track as easily as it does with people without glasses. People with glasses might want to wait until stability improves."

I've only found one thing I'd like to see improved in the final version, and that is the ability to recognize and ignore reflections from the user's glasses, if they wear them. I understand that using only a 2-dimensional image of a person's face to process a 3-dimensional rendering of the avatar restricts the software's ability to recognize certain features of the user's face. My problem is, I wear glasses, and the software has trouble recognizing my eyes with them on. Either the avatar's eyes are always closed, or it blinks rapidly and looks like it is having some kind of seizure. I can disable blinking and stuff from the menu, sure, but I don't want to have to do that. Though my glasses have a coating that reduces the amount of glare from reflections, they reflect my monitor just enough to cause problems. And I am blind as a bat without them.Facerig also doesn't seem to ""turn off"" or ""release"" the camera after I quit the application. In other words, the camera stays on but nothing is using it.On another note, I am delighted in the number of ""animal"" avatars available. That's really cool!"

It's a mocap (motion capture) system for webcams, which replaces, in pretty close to real time, your face with a 3D animated model instead.Overall, it's a very good program. The models are mostly high quality, the customization options are fairly respectable and so on. There are a few issues, such as lip synching which assumes you have a brittish accent and tends to add extra syllables that aren't actually pronounced. Another minor issue is it has problems tracking any sort of quick motions or motions which go past a fairly restrictive range of movement and it'll take a second or three to re-synch.As a whole, however, for $10, it's remarkably high quality. Many times over higher quality than it has any right to be for that cost, actually. It's fun, effective, and will generate some pretty fun conversations at the very least.A lot of the features have yet to be implemented, so keep in mind that this is basically beta software, yet higher quality than most full releases.The difference between the standard version and the pro version, is simply that the pro version lets you use it for professional use (ie: you get paid for such). Like you could use it to stream or for youtube if you aren't getting paid for your content with the standard version, but if you want to use it for things that generate revinue, then you have to pay a bit more.A studio version will be available next year supposedly which makes it actually useful for generating revinue, however, so I'd suggest holding out for that. In theory, the studio version will allow for recording animations, then exporting the animation files into programs like Maya to tidy up the animation curves and make it look professional, which would make it the cheapest quality motion capture option out there, really. Well, short of ""free"" stuff which largely sucks, to be blunt.For those with modeling experience, you don't technically need to own the program to build a model and rig it for use in facerig, and you can even sell your models without owning the software, but you wouldn't be able to test to verify that it works properly with facerig, so make of that as you will. It's still a nice policy, though.For the moment, facerig has some issues, but promises to be updated with patches to add new features and tighten up the quality of the features that exist, and that's well worth looking into.As a whole, it works fairly well. It's not the highest quality motion capture program out there, but considering those run into the thousands of dollars, and this is $10 and works pretty much out of the box almost with only a few setting tweaks which are easy to make, it's a good option for the average person, and those with 3D design experience will find it even more useful since you can add your own models in as well.-------------------June 18th, 2015 update:A few new features have been added since this review was added originally, and an updated GUI has been thrown in as well. It's a little more confusing than before, but a fair bit more powerful in terms of what you can do with it. The average user will probably find themselves playing with settings for an hour or more when they first start out before getting it to do exactly what they want, but once you've got it down, it's not that bad.The ability to record videos has been added, and these are exported as .webm files. With a fair bit of tinkering, I was able to get facerig to work well enough for youtube. Another nice benefit is that the audio files are saved separately as well as .mp3's so you can edit the audio individually in something like soundforge. Premiere will need a bit of help to figure out what to do with .webm's though.If you run into technical problems, feel free to ask them on the steam forum! I've had a few issues I've run into and every time I've asked, within 12 hours I had a very detailed and well-explained answer, with full follow-up, not just copy/pasting from a text file. Like they actually took the time to understand the issues I had and did actual troubleshooting. Seriously, I haven't seen a company with customer service this good before. They are literally #1 by far in this department, so that's a major bonus in their favour!There is currently an issue with the recording aspect where slower computers (my poor piece of junk for example =P ) can run into a video/audio desync. There's not much that can be done to fix this as of this update, short of re-recording the clip again, but when I ran into the issue I was given a list of ways to mitigate the issue, and that they're aware of this issue and a patch fix is in the works. There's definitely continually updated support, so it will keep on getting better with time!Again, this is not the greatest motion capture software in the business - but anything better out there costs $30,000 for the liscence, so that should give you an idea of what you're looking at. For $10, there's really no way to argue that this is a bad deal. And it's vastly better than whatever similar program you probably had come bundled with your webcam, because there really is no comparision between them in terms of quality."

Many of these models are fantastic in their capacity to display highly-expressive emotion properly and on time, such as Zyraxes (R), which appears to look stoned half the time when I use him. In addition, they're collaborating with the developers of games I appreciate (such as Starbound; I wouldn't have purchased FaceRig if I didn't instantly fall in love with the Floran model), and revolutionary experimental software (Live2D), the former of which is offered for free.FaceRig has given me a significant amount of enjoyment through Skype shenanigans, among other things, and was well worth the $15 price. I'm not sure I can recommend it for business use, given that it's still highly unrefined, however, with the sheer number of currently available avatars, the potential for more to be released through the Steam Workshop and for free, and the quality improvements of existing avatars FaceRig has implemented since its appearance on Steam, it continues to explode with potential. Currently the best publicly available facial-recognition software, FaceRig is worth buying just to see Zyraxes twirling a highly-suggestive alien antennae attached to his tongue as he reacts with you to the display.PS: I do hope they avoid rigging real people. Their Pewdieverse DLC was a horrible idea, and although that may have been mostly due to the average Steam user's ""slightly"" negative impression of PewDiePie, I feel the concept itself is bad. FaceRig seems to model its best characters after works of fiction and fantasy (such as TF2), and I would hate to see it begin adding celebrities such as Brad Pitt. If that were the case, it would be targetting a very specific audience not commonly found on Steam... God forbid they add other youtubers. Thanks for reading!"

Keep that in mind!The face recognition is a tad touchy and I have a gotee so the characters always seem to smirk even when I try to force a frown- I'm not sure yet if that's on me or if that's the software... I'll have to have a few friends try it to be sure but for the life of me I can't get the one cheek to respond correctly.Additionally, the software is great and easy to use- it takes the place of a camera so when you have any application that uses video feed you can use that ""camera"" instead to call people on skype, record video, so on and so forth.One of the biggest complaints I have is the watermark on the software- I understand that I purchased the normal version but I did pay money for it and as shallow of a complaint as it is, when I chat with my friends I don't want a watermark giving away my ""secret"" before I choose to. I hope the developers choose to remove this but I hightly doubt they will. Keep in mind that you can purchase the license software as well and the watermark will still be there.Other than that, the customization is surprisingly simple- you're able to create alternate colors of the characters as well as upload 3D models if you so choose.

The face tracking wound up being very simplistic, similar to what you see in Google Hangouts or Snapchat's new facetracking filters. It just followed the eyes, eyebrows, and whether the mouth is open or closed (but not more subtle movements like making an ""O"" with your mouth). I appreciate the effort and intent here, but unfortunately it just doesn't deliver. For example, if I make a sad, pouty face, the avatar will often smile. If my bottom lip curls up over my top one, into a pout, the avatar's bottom lip should curl up over its top one. There also weren't nearly as many avatars as I was expecting--and many of them were limited to just one gender. So, for example, there was only a female alien, no male alien. This reduced the number of possible avatars for me to select from."

I just ran some quick tests to see if it would work well for students and teachers.The only show-stopper for actually using it in a business environment would be that the tracking needs to be a little faster for speech (it's hard to see the lips moving if you talk at normal speed). This probably just requires the developers to nail down sensativity to lip movement.If you like the idea and see a purpose for it, pick it up. This one is worth supporting in Early Release.

This interface ends up being one of the big selling parts of this software because the flexibility (once you've figured out what you are doing) is just amazing.  Here's an example:  At first I was having problems with the avatar keeping it's eyes closed, but between the documentation and forums, I was able to fairly quickly diagnose the problem and fix it.  Basically, I set it to blink automatically.Also, I was having difficulty getting the program to track my movements, but the documentation clearly showed what I needed to do to my webcam to improve that and now it works like a charm.EXPRESSIVENESS:  This is my one area of complaint, but it's only a partial complaint.  I should state right away that I haven't tried all the avatars, but I have tried a few including all of the Halloween pack.  I basically found the Halloween pack to not meet my expectations.  I recorded a couple of videos, one with the pumpkin and one with the mummy, and neither one really was expressive enough to let my viewers know what I was feeling.  On the other hand, some of the avatars are incredible, most notably the hamburger.  I did a recording of myself playing ""I am Bread"" and thought that having facerig really made the video better.  Very noticeable expressions and kind of funny too.I don't have an example of what I was talking about with the Halloween videos because I deleted those, but I can show you what I mean with the other one.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQF9BkR8LnM&index=2&list=PLV8i2f0l80BnmUYGrynMKOyvVcD8ujWT4You can do it without the black borders on the edges.

If you forget all the other crap that's going on in the video and just watch the bread, you can almost read it's lips.  Just amazing.  That did take a little work, though, to sync up the sound with the video.So overall, I say this is a buy, but don't get your heart necessarily set on one particular avatar unless you've already seen someone else using it.  Some are better than others."

The team also plans on allowing users to make their own faces and backgrounds, so, you can already imagine the amount of content that will come out of this.So, is it worth it? I can give you two answers; Yes, and noYes if you have money to spare and get in skype calls very often, and if you like messing with that kind of stuff because the program allows for a rather big amount of editing over what it does and what it doesn't do.No if you have a low quality camera, and if money is rare on your side."

For the face to really be very accurate and not have occasional issues mapping your mouth or not making weird eye twitches you're going to need proper lighting on your face, a good position and quality of webcam, and potentially a lot of tweaking the settings.I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who thinks they're going to use this for something professional, but if you just want to play around with it or you're trying to ERP or whatever it is people do with this software, yeah, it's fun.

It's fun to make interesting expressions, and I take an interesting advantage of this for sketching.Yes, sketching!It's very good practice, to me that is.

My only other issue with the software is that it doesnt let me select my microphone, forcing me to use my webcam's audio capability.When intergrated with obs the software seems to slip in pretty easily, although I reccomend using your own audio for the time being, while editing the delay in FaceRig.All in all, I definately reccomending using this program atleast once to try it out, it is pretty decent for only being in beta, so for the clunks that are present in it, they can be assumed to be gotten rid of once this program leaves beta."

Having said that, It is also the most aggravating piece of software I have ever run across in the audio department. I bought it to use in conjunction with Morphvox Pro for a special purpose for children's lessons. Yes it is true that my Computer is not a high end desktop system but it holds it's own with this stuff but it is constantly losing it's ability to have the playback loop work. With and without the Morphvox software running. I have gone thru all the settings many, many times and re-installed the pre-requisites over and over. Sometimes the second pre-requisite does not re-install without first going into the control panel and deleting it there as per computer instructions because ocaisionally install_webmd refusing to finish installing unless you uninstall first and then it requires a computer reboot before it installs correctly. I have done the virtual mic, screaminbee when Morphvox is running, windows mapper, my mic and every other combo to get playback loop up and working again while recording to no avail. It has become so frustrating to me I am just dumbfounded. Sometimes even the mouse will hover and highlight every single option except the exact one you are trying to highlight (i.e. devices) I am not a complete idiot either as I do actually hold a degree in computer science and have messed with computers since the TRS-80 model 1 which I bought in 1981. The audio stability of this software is just something to be desired. So I go ahead and record without playback loop audible and when I load in the .wav file or the movie, it of course has recorded without any effects that I had assigned and that is without Morphvox open and just using the in-house effects. I have a Logitech h390 headset with mic and the sound comes thru fine and is heard easily but just not the playback loop.I would send in a copy of the logs but to tell the truth I promise I tried that setting already !!  This is just more of a rant after owning this product for 48 hours and logging at least a 1/3 of that messing with it's functionality and performance. It really is a good product and killer animations but the audio portion stinks. At least from where I am sitting right now !!"

,Not Recommended,274920,30792136,Posted: 28 March,all,Cabby,"This piece of software is not only badly designed, its fundamentally flawed from the get go.  This is just an outright bad idea to go with.First off, the concept of face tracking itself.  This method of motion tracking using a visual camera is abysmal.  It takes far more resources than any other tracking method.  Its only benefit is that you can use a generic camera that any person will be likely to have, but more on that later.  It does not scale well at distances; in fact, it is very picky where you put your face at all.  Minute lighting differences or wearing glasses has a drastic affect on tracking quality.  Tracking with a single camera is also very limiting to this software’s uses.  Being “phuny” on a YouTube video or a Skype call is about all you can do with this.  Its so picky with tracking that you basically have to sit in a single spot, barely dispacing yourself from initial tracking or else risk losing all the tracked animations.  You can forget about looking in any direction that isn’t in the camera’s general direction.Secondly, the hardware. If you use a $20-40 webcam you got at Walmart, you are gonna have a very bad time.  Of course you would want professional recording equipment if you wanted optimal results for something like this, but FaceRig performs so poorly its basically mandatory.  The developers even go so far as to say you NEED a 60FPS camera; something that is pretty important, but is NOT a standard for PC web cams.  Majority of web cams on the market cap at 30 FPS because they are not intended for this kind of use(expected use is video chats, which focus on limiting visual data for better streams).  This isn’t a big deal for YouTubers, who would have the necessary equipment AND the know how to configure a proper setting for it.  Your general prank Skype callers will quit of frustration.  Speaking of the YouTubers though!Yall are gonna have to pay up for an extra, professional license if your channel is popular.  Honestly?  Spend your money else where.  Plenty of better, cheaper gimmicks that end up looking far more entertaining than this crap.You know why all the screen shots have this excited, “:D” face to them?  Its because that is the easiest face for this software to pick up accurately.  In actual use, you will find awkward glitches in the tracking constantly.  Again, unless you are a YouTuber with good equipment, you’ll make a fool of yourself in a way you didn’t intend for; buying this garbage for $15.Mentioning pricing reminds me: do you want to use all the anime grills people have made in the workshop?  Do you want to use workshop content at all?  Because ♥♥♥♥ you, that’s another $4 just to have the right to access them.  The entire workshop is filled to the brim with 2D Live content.  I could only find 3 regular FaceRig mods in my search.  I subscribed to 2 of them, 1 crashed the application.  In the off chance that you want to make your own 2D Live character, you are in for an even bigger world of hurt.  The application needed to make the characters is developed by an entirely different third party, whose based in Japan.  Majority of the quality tutorials are in Japanese. Its also quite a bit more expensive than this app itself; as opposed to regular 3D models which can be made in open source modeling applications such as Blender.One thing that completely baffles my mind: a pre-recorded video of someone’s tracking performance can yield different results when fed into another PC opposed to the live performance.  Its so mind bogglingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I really can’t explain how you can mess up an app that bad.  Perhaps I should take it up with the forums, but I really don’t care at this point.  The tracking is inaccurate anyway.  You will be fighting with it constantly, trying to find the optimal sitting arrangement just so you don’t have to worry about it derping out every 3 seconds.Lastly, to extend on the point of this awful design, visual motion tracking is both inefficient and, at this point, obsolete.  Emitter based tracking has taken over this department.  Its a bit more niche, considering that you need very specific, extra hardware along with the software, but it performs so much better with less overhead on the CPU.  It scales better, it detects better, and it can be run with a single standard design.  Even if you use visual tracking, using something similar to the PlayStation Moves colored ball design is far superior than trying to keep track of every possible configuration of skin tone, head/mouth/eye size, hair/glasses, etc.  It would be silly, but I would EASILY prefer wearing some skin tight mask and software specific camera than using this.  This app is worthless to me, and should be to just about anyone else.  By the time you spent money on professional recording equipment and the DLC packs you want, you could have easily purchased something a lot more entertaining and useful.PS:  Why do you have achievements?  Why does any kind of software have achievements?  I don’t use software to feel like I have done something cool, I use them to help MAKE something cool.  That isn’t gonna happen with this."

Using a 3770k at 4.7ghz when I run Facerig in games my CPU usage maxes out at 100%. This causes games to stutter so badly that they become unplayable. I have tried the recommended suggestions by decreasing the default 60fps to 30fps (I went as low as 20fps) and it didn't resolve anything.So for anyone getting this to stream games whilst the tracking and avatar selection is good when it comes to practical use Facerig fails.

On the Beta, the facial tracking is a little off on ""hard-to-read"" angles and expressions, but a lot more stable and easy to work with (including recognition and speech tracking) than I would have expected. Again, this is only the Beta and there is still a lot more content and updates to come to improve the stability and over-all performance of this software.In a nutshell, fantastic purchase.

The avatars provided range from the cuteness of doge to the nightmare fuel that is lord burgore the floating cheese burger. The number of avatars avialble along with customization options  of each is a tad limited currently but agian this is an early release product. I'm hoping for steam workshop support as thist will greatly increase the users possible selection of avatars, props and backgrounds.Speaking of backgrounds the program comes with a small selection of stock backgrounds for your avatar to inhabit.A dark hallway, a scenic green forest, a futuristic backdrop, and a couple more i haven't tried yet. Course you can also just go with your own room but where is the fun in that?The avatar lipsyncs with your words and some facial expressions ( depending on the avatar and expression) ,the tracking, while decent still needs a touch more work to better help the avatar project facial motions made.for example the midori-chan (anime based) avatar kept doing a weird half scowl half smirk expression when i was in a neutral expression.Facerig sports recording and broadcasting features giving it some ambition in hopes to appeal to people wanting to use the program for the production of videos for youtube or other such sites.  It also takes the need to hunt for third party programsout of the picture, though only if it caan match the quaility of the ever popular open broadcast, or ffsplit.I would diffently recommend this program for those looking to spice of their chat experience, specially if it gets steam workshop support which will add a good amount of addintional user based content."

Not a big deal.) Surprisingly lightweight. I was able to run it on my laptop in battery mode and it didn't even slow down. Definitely would reccomend this.Do note, however, that having a decent microphone and video card is important. the video card because this does do quite a bit of fancy-pantsrendering. The microphone because lipsync is largely based on the sound that goes through it.If you have a complete **** built-in microphone like I do, you can turn up the sensitivity settings in the software, but my reccommendation is that you just get a better mic.A microphone is not required for mouth movements to work, however, without it, the software will only reproduce broad mouth shapes, and less of the finer ones.Also, be aware that there IS a watermark on the video, even if you've bought it. A bit of a nuisance, but, hopefully, it will be removed/ made less annoying in future.I give this a 10/10, for beta software. Lots of fun, though not really practical.

Software renders itself as an virtual webcam usable in any software that accepts webcams.How did i get my own character into this?Well i had this avatar i made a little while before knowing this softare, basically an alien i made in spore and exported to later on modify allot in blender (improving the look and adding more realistic suitable clothes). Then i read through the manual several times and experimented with the example characters aviable. Then i made my own character working the the whole head with tongue and 4 eyes working and everything. I knew a certain amount of how blender worked which is why i could pull this.Later on i did an upgraded version of my blue personal character with 2 working arms beside the head. And the whole body visible with a wagging tail behind me.I also got an character released at the workshop (guess what) another character made in spore but modified a little later on.

I purchased it specifically because of the Live2D module, but that's also been a bit disappointing.The face tracking is fine, but the rigging and parameterization aren't really up to snuff, so the subtler gestures of the human face are really under-expressed, and the more overt ones are sometimes overexpressed. There's also little accounting for the differences in expressiveness between the various human facial structures and ranges of human physical expression. Some people show teeth when they smile, some don't. Some people's lip edges actually point downward when they frown, some don't. Some people open their mouths wide when they speak, some people make subtler lip motions. I can see the tracker keeping up with all of this, but the model does not seem to account for it correctly. Tuning is long and tedious and only helps a little bit. Most furstrating, though, is thesignificantlatency in the model's expression.I don't think Holotech has been lazy here. I think the tech is just still in its infancy. Live2D was particularly disappointing because the range of expressiveness for the models tends to be so very low to begin with.Still, I consider this to be prototypical tech; breaking ground in a new consumer segment. I'm hoping that FaceRig gets some competition and that all of the involved tech (especially Live2D) makes large strides forward."

Facerig is cpu intesive2. Qoulity of your webcam video3. Inter net band with (if ur streaming)4. The cpu usige of the game ur playingAll 4 of thoues things put to gethere make up if your steam will lag or your games and or facerig its self. also keep in mind that well streaming facerig affect cpu of the vewer in some casses ive hade this expeance whith one of my vewers. so the vewers pc is also in question for band with and facerig (not on powerfull computers in that case its just band with)So if you want to get the most out of this program, check your cpu for each game, and then facerig by themselfs. Then after that check, with facrig and the game do to it can efact each other and you will see if its the game or the facerig at falt.I recomend this for any one that knows what they are doing with there pc and cpu and not for the genral person."

However, if you're thinking ""Wow this is really neat, I want to do a custom one!"" forget it unless you are a full on 3d artist with about a month to spend on rigging and prep.Technically yes, you can create custom models but, trust me when I tell you...it's daunting. The 2d models are easier because there's some better tools to use but if you're wanting to add a new model or do something custom then you might want to pass on this software as it's just not there yet.Another thing is their documentation. You'd think that a company would just create a spot on their website with all their documentation or any help files, but no...their documentation is spread out all over the place, forums, steam, inside threads created by others. So not only is it EXTREMELY difficult to add any sort of customization, the documents that you will need to do that is literally spread out all over the place.In the end, it's a very promising peice of software but until they get a definitive set of documentation, some better tools, and refining the avatar creation process this unfortunatly limits this software to just a gimmick."

This is not to say that eventually the technology will reach a decent level, I just feel that right now, the price is too high for the standard of the product."

I love how in their descriptiopn they say you can use it for every usage, skype, video and streaming etc,An average game use about 9cpu.( Heroes of the storm, LoL, Cs:go)OBS which is my streaming programme take about 21 cpu with my overlay and stuff.( Yes streaming does need a good comp).But FACERIG take an average of 35 cpu. Like really. I tryed lowering the resolution to the minimum, dropping every fps including looping to 20 which is lower then the minimum to have a decent working and still I can only get it down to 26cpu.I have a built copmputer worth of 1300$ bought 4 month ago and with streaming, a normal game open and facerig I hit 100% cpu usage and I start lagging. Without streaming and game open JUST facerig I hit about 50% cpu usage.So if you want to have fun alone with funny face it can be worth 10$. But forget about taking it to ANY public level or your computer wont be able to run it."

Facerig is a god send for a person that wants to keep their real life self hidden from the internet using a mask of a character. The problem is that making your own 3D character to work with this software is a pain and have a high risk of failure. It is a shame. I had high hopes for this software.I commissioned somebody to design a 3D model for facerig and he soon run into trouble. He tried to get support to get it working, but support ended up turning their back on him. I tried to see that facerig devs can expand their rigging services, but instead I was told to throw the person that commissioned back into the lion's den. He soon came back telling me that it didn't work out as once again they became quiet. He told me that we may not be the target audience for this software and I agreed with him. They did turn their back on us twice.I wanted it do a youtube video on my channel to complain about facerig, but I couldn't figure out how to do it without breaking my character and going OOC. Right now the only thing I can do is warn people that making avatar for this software is a high risk thing and the community is slowly disappearing. I wish you luck if you continue."

I know FaceRig is intended to be semi-photorealistic, but computers with older CPUs are unable to run the software smoothly (there is basically lag). Simple slider to set output render quality would be sufficient (like setting the output to 640x480 instead of 1280x720 etc.). I think some users would appreciate that."

Simply put, it's still in its early phase and because of this, it has its flaws and tbh, not being able to use the software effectively because you have small eyes is a little bit of shame (personal experience *Sad Face*).Anyway, long story short, get it if you are confident you can use it effectively, otherwise just take pride in that you know what software a new upcoming youtuber or twitcher is using because it probably not for you."

No amount of troubleshooting fixed it, and I decided that a slight asymmetric feature of my face (my left eyelid droops EVER SO SLIGHTLY-- almost unnoticably unless you're looking at my eyes side-by-side and I just told you about it.) was causing the on-screen avatar to have a stroke and a seizure at the same time. Even holding my eye wide open and sitting perfectly still, portions of the avatar's cheeks and jaw jiggled and twitched aimlessly and when moving my mouth to lip sync, it only moved about every other word.If you're really interested, and you're hopeful for a working FaceRig, I would either ensure that it works for you, ensure that you're using ideal settings (both computer settings, and real life contextual settings such as plain, bright lighting and sitting a specific angle to your webcam) and even then don't be surprised at the unfortunate hiccups, twitches and other immersion-destroying issues.Not a bad product; not a bad project; not a bad idea.. just... doesn't work.

To make matters worse, the launcher they use is prone to hangs and the developers left it in knowing full well that once launched, it freezes systems. (I can tell they intentionally left it in because they have a launch option choice to TRY and bypass it; but if you forget to select the bypass option, have fun with your computer restart, because thats the only way its closing!)My jimmies are far too rustled to do anything but give a bad review to a product that intentionally has broken, system destabilizing content left in it with what are essentially advertisement banners shoved into a PAID product."

Lips sync, change backgrounds, customise avatar's colours and stuff...I tested the motions out at 2am with only my lamp on. It was in poor lighting and it still managed to pick up my expressions really well.There r some greyed out features which I can assume it will b added in future updates and Im excited to see what new updates will bring.btw u use this program to replace your camera as a virtual camera, meaning with any Skype video calls, the recipent will see the avatars lipsyncing and copying your movements.

In conditions with fairly poor lighting, such as a bedroom, the camera cannot detect face movement so well, which makes the avatar ""twitch"". Unless you have the right lighting gear, I'd only advise using this during the day.Level of customisation in the softwear itself is basic; there is also no guide built into the softwear on how to import your own models or textures, making the level of modding and self-use rather limiting unless you know where to look.Overall it works well and does what it says on the tin, but needs a little bit more work doing to the guide to cover people who want to import their own work, for that extra personal touch."

The face doesn't match my actual expressions very well and only a limited range of expressions are possible. I can smile, I can kind of squint my eyes (but sometimes the eyes act weird). I can shake my head no, but if I nod yes, it confuses it into thinking I'm closing my eyes because it can't even figure out that face getting shorter = angle changing. Somewhat understandably, it doesn't track my hands, but that's a huge handicap when I talk with my hands (I'm part Italian, it seems to be in my blood). Really, the advantage of seeing my face or an avatar is that you can see my expressions. If I can't make half the expressions I want to or even make gestures with my hands, then it's no better than a phone call with no visual representation.I used this with MorphVox to modify my voice and the effect was kinda nice. It would be cool if this app had better voice changing abilities to actually match the characters, although fixing the flaws in the facial expression tracking is a much higher priority.Also, the fact that this is Windows-only is a huge bummer. I would prefer Linux and Mac as well as the main thing I'd like to use this with is Skype, which is already cross-platform and I'm not on Windows most of the time. Having this on iOS and Android would also be a plus if I'm still somehow able to use this with Skype (might not be possible though).So in short, my dream of leaving my mortal carcass behind to be an anime girl must be deferred.... for now"

While this can be pretty much fixed by disabling the eye tracking/enabling autoblink or ajusting light to fix glare, it makes me sad that I can't squint or look surprised with those features disabled/enabled. So, if you have glasses, this still can work, but you may want to look into using contacts with this instead (or be like me and give up on your glasses and use this blind).The only other downside I've found is that I prefer to use a headset to talk (if I used my webcam, there would be a bit too much background noise) and the headset can mess up the ability for the software/webcam to see some facial expressions. However, this could be fixed by getting a standalone mic that would just sit on a desk, but still block out background noise.Overall, this was totally worth buying a brand new webcam that I will never use for anything else.10/10, would doge again."

76561198077872600,Recommended,274920,32354803,Posted: 11 June,all,Raccoon In A Trash Can,"I first purchased this product in October of 2016. It was fairly fun to use, I even used it in some livestreams. I refunded it not long after, however, not becausse I didn't enjoy the product--but rather because it kept reading my glasses as being my eyes and so my expressions would be distorted. It would make it look like Fluffo either had a severe case of lazy eye or some type of damage which prevented his eyes from staying open. While it certainly gave me many laughs, it bothered me that there was no way to effectively compensate for this without losing a degree of functionality. I need my glasses on to be able to see at all, being extremely nearsighted. It was my hope that they would come to accomodate for users who have to wear glasses all of the time, or otherwise have their trackability by the face-detection software be impaired.Instead, when I reacquired the software on June 9th, I was disappointed to find that the face-detection still interpreted my glasses as being my eyes--even more so than when I first tried FaceRig. I had gotten a new pair of glasses since the last time and thought that maybe after a few months the software would have been improved or other methods of compensating for problems that wearing glasses cause with face-detection would have emerged.FaceRig is a unique program, to be sure, and definitely one that you should try out for yourself. But be warned, if you have to wear glasses all of the time, the face-detectin owill in all likelihood see part or all of your glasses as being your eyes, and you'll be left with awkward, twitchy and otherwise unpleasant facial expressions.All that aside, FaceRig is worth the cost. It's my hope that the program can be made more accessible to people who wear prescription glasses 24/7. A thoroughly amusing and at the same time frustrating experience, but one that I still enjoyed immensely."
