I'm never normally the type to leave negative reviews for that same reason. But this? Boggles my mind how this got released.I played this for 13 minutes, and saw numerous issues that would have had me sending this back until they were fixed: Glitchy/sluggish menus, ugly textures, clunky controls, enemies take too many shots to kill, animations are wonky, and enemies glitch through walls making them almost invulnerable. If I noticed this in 13 minutes, i'm certain the devs of this noticed these issues as well.Shameful."

,Not Recommended,275060,32681474,Posted: 23 June,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Alone in the Dark... for survival horror fans, the franchise needs no introduction; it's indeed the grandfather of the genre, predating the rise of Resident Evil by four years. The earlier games, namely the initial trilogy, are completely bare bones by today's standards, but they're still considered some of the best survival horror experiences to date. Alone in the Dark: Illumination is the sixth release in the series, and it brings with it a new approach in terms of gameplay.Moving away from the general structure of a survival horror game, Alone in the Dark: Illumination instead focuses on co-op and multiplayer gameplay in the same vein as Left 4 Dead and any other wave-based survival shooter. You have your choice of four characters, the witch, the priest, the engineer, and the hunter; each possess their own skill sets and special items that can be used. There's also a leveling system, and for each level some skill points are earned to further develop the multiple skill trees of each class. Even the four levels are set up in a Left 4 Dead style fashion, with each being split into four sections for an easier time with co-op in case your friend has to bolt; which they will, after playing this heaping mound of maggot infested donkey bile.For a wave-based survival shooter, this title sure is lacking enemies. During the first level you will encounter a handful of Spiderman-in-the-Venom-suit looking foes, and by the time you reach the end, if you've dispatched every single bad guy, you'll have 21 kills. This persists through every single part of every single level, though only getting worse as time goes by. There are no random spawns, only pre-designated allotments of enemies after certain events unfold, such as blasting a path to the next area or opening the door to the end of the level. This leaves all of the environments entirely empty, and without anything to do save for the base objectives of getting from point A to point B by finding batteries, explosives, electrical wire, etc.There's little to no music, very little ambience, and many of the sound effects are missing. For example, when blowing away a huge boulder using dynamite there was absolutely no explosion sound effect. There are also no footstep sounds, save for when you jump, and if you find yourself waist-deep in water, there's no splashing or water movement effects. This title also has horrid optimization, with framerates constantly fluctuating from 160 FPS down to 70 FPS with all settings on max while running on an i7 6700k/GTX 1080 system. Now that's not unplayable by any means, but for lower-end rigs it is going to present a much larger problem.It's as if the developer accidentally released the alpha, not even the beta, version of Alone in the Dark: Illumination. The biggest, and most unforgivable factor here being the absurd lack of enemies and the terrible AI of the ones that do show up. I was able to stand right in front of many foes, to which they just teeter and stare back at me, doing nothing. Some will follow you, some may even try to attack you eventually, but if you attempt to lure them into the light they'll stand just outside of its radius and stare some more. Mind you, I was also playing on the highest difficulty available, which is a laughable skip through the park. I've played a lot of really awful games in my day, but this one takes the cake, and I'm truly sorry for any unfortunate individual that pre-ordered or paid full price for this absolute scam.Rating:0.5/5.0- Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

It is in the running for the worst game of 2015 very quickly, and it's made it clear with its horrible animation quality and abysmal enemy AI that Atari has bottomed out as a publisher at this point. The Alone in the Dark franchise, if you can even can call that a franchise anymore, is now buried with an unbelievably lackluster co-op shooter (which is hilarious considering its ALONE IN THE GOD DAMN DARK). There's no enjoyment to be taken here other then laughing at what exactly Atari has become as a publisher. It's literally the bottom of the barrel, and they should be ashamed to even have attempted to charge 30 dollars for this garbage. This isn't even a joke bad game, given it's cost. Avoid it like the plague.Gameplay and Video First Impressions:http://youtu.be/q4q9IPhahEsLists:Positives:Honestly, I can't think of one. The light mechanic was a nice try at an idea, I guess?Ok, it's “neat” that it changes up the door that you have to go through at times.You can get a few laughs out of it for how awful it is.NegativesThe animation quality is done right horrible. These are unnatural creatures, but my god they look so unrealistic and unnatural when moving its comical.Fun is foreign to this game's vocabulary. It's so lackluster and there is no polish or oompf at all.The light mechanic doesn't work with the AI being THIS dumb. You'll die for the stupidest of reasons, all not related to your own skill.And it causes choke points due to the light mechanic itself. It's mindless shooting most of the time, even with the objective elements in it.Oh, and disappearing bodies and bodies getting stuck in walls. Always appreciated. It did get a chuckle out of me or two, but not when one of the enemies who got stuck was a spitter I couldn't kill.The game within one hour crashed several times within gameplay. Which is always great!The performance is a joke too. It was clear when it was trying to load in enemies, as the game plummeted in frame rate at that point. I've seen student projects run at a better frame rate then this.It's an ugly looking game in the end. It's not the worst, but my god for a 30 dollar game.Missing sound elements on enemy hits and monster sounds. Also, for there supposibly being dialogue based on the options menu, that's sorta a joke.There's a reason it wasn't advertised. Atari knew this game was bad.In what world did Atari believe that this game would sell for the same price as Killing Floor 2. I mean, I don't like making direct comparisons in reviews most of the time, but it's a joke on this price point alone."

Yes really EMO since the character spends half a page describing her emotions. The old gods versus new gods principle is in the game which is minimal for a lovecraftian storyline but while the ambiance is there something is definitly missing ... Technicly the game renders well and gameplay is fluid , the character animation is well at best pretty much self absorbed ... (look how i cast my spells in SLOWMO) , I really fail to understand how no one during the beta stages of the game went harsher on some of the existing aspects .If at any point the devs would have looked for a WELL rendered piece of lovecraftian gaming they should have looked at TSW's Kingsmouth storyline ... there you have a typical lovecraftian setup and ambiance with action that will keep you at each custscene to the edge of your seat ... and yes TSW has its failings in some manner but well you have to give them that YES , they can tell a story worth reading have build a quest set worth digging into , a lore system nothing short of extensive and deeply connected .I am sorry to say but i long expected this title with bated breath . and i am nothing short of disappointed by the story being told , many parts of the gameplay in general . Otherwise Kudos on the rendering, but even the character is not even fully visible (back side camera and little free wheeling there as well ) . Oh last detail the witch has shoulderblades of an olympian swimmer in intense trainning (think 1980's East Germany) ."

This is like a combination of Resident Evil 4, Left 4 Dead, and Alan Wake, except terrible in every way. It's a Co-op shooter, but good luck finding anyone to play with. The controls are stiff and awkward, it all feels very dated. The guns feel just horrible. No recoil, no feedback or anything. There's also serious lack of guns. The enemy AI is just terrible, don't think I've actually played a game with worse AI. Everything is glitchy. On max settings the game looks bad and there's ridiculous pop-in. This is exactly my type of game, and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I really wanted it to be good."

Nothing but a wall of text to explain the story at the beginning of each new area... -_-.  Not what I would call fun, not exactly true to AiTD series. If anything, if your looking for something reminiscent of that look up Call Of Cthulhu Dark Corners of the Earth or get A New Nightmare. I was in the for beta of this game, it was awkward as hell, so I thought to myself. Possibility for improvement. Well, we got that but it was a slight improvment. Visuals touched up, hit detection, and that's about all I saw. Not worth the price of 34.99$ for that tag spend the extra cash, get The Evil Within. I love Alone In The Dark, can't say much about this game. It's a generic third person shooter with some Alan Wake elements and that's about it.EDIT: Recent patch, added a pretty good voice over, animations got a good second pass, FOV is pretty decent, walk is default and run is shift now. They made some pretty massive improvements. I wouldnt reccomend it yet but they definatly are going on the right track!"

Therefore I pre-purchased this game thinking this would be an updated version of those games I knew and loved.However this game is basically a third rate 'shoot ‘em up' and seems to bear no resemblance whatsoever to the original genre.  For the technicalities of the game I am sure the reader can access other more learned reviewers who I am convinced will be able to explain the many technical failings of this game.  My advice is simply not to waste your money on it.  I have uninstalled the game already and have no intention of re-visiting it.  I feel thoroughly let down by the fact that the 'Alone in the Dark' franchise has been so spoilt.  Do not buy this game!

,Not Recommended,275060,26317097,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,keihtg,"UPDATE: Got a refund for this gameI'm normally a fan of ""bad"" or ""budget"" games, but Alone in the Dark Illumination just takes the cake with how horrendous it is. First of all, shame on a legendary brand like Atari for letting this out the door. As other reviews have said, there's pretty much NOTHING in this game that's commendable, and normally I don't pay too much attention to negative reviews (especially when they don't list specific problems), but this time I really should have. Here is a summary of deal-breaking flaws I encountered with this game:- BIGGEST DEAL-BREAKER: the MAJORITY of the time, I'd run into a glitch that would make the current level impossible to beat. Usually, it's a door that simply will not open, making it impossible to proceed. The best example is the first door in the first level (literally seconds into the game). Either that or a required item would spawn in an inaccessible portion of the map. The worst thing about these glitches is that they can occur mid-way through a mission.- Forget about using a controller, although you can manually map it in the controls menu. The main problem is that one of the most frequently used keys in the game, the ""USE"" key (for turning on lights, opening doors, picking up items) is NOT remappable from the ""F"" key. Also, be warned that I un-mapped the mouse scroll wheel, and it wouldn't let me re-map it (so I had to map weapon-select to the TAB key).- Getting around is excruciating with how slow your character moves and how quickly they run out of stamina (and can't run). To make matters worse, when you level up, the skill tree makes you choose between getting more health or more stamina (effectively locking the other one out).- Enemies spawn randomly throughout the levels in a ""horde mode""-style, and the number of them can vary wildly from playthrough to playthough...the first time I played, I got absolutely BOMBARDED with enemies, but was able to kill dozens and dozens before dying. The next time, I tried speed-running through the level and ran into a dozen enemies at most. Ironically, I got way more experience points from dying the first time than from actually beating the mission.- Each level seems to consist of a hub area and several branching paths...you run out to each path, pick up an item, and bring it back to the hub. I'm not sure if this structure ever changes.- There's no manual and no real in-game explanation of the game systems. Partway through the first mission, you MAY get some text popping-up telling you that enemies are vulnerable in light, but otherwise, you'll have to figure out how your powers work on your own. Also, there's no cooldown indicator on your powers, you you'll have no idea when they're ready to use again after you've used them.- You don't really know when you're taking damage a lot of the time. Sometimes the screen will flash red, but your character never yells out, and a hit sound doesn't seem to play very often. As you get closer to death, the screen also doesn't warn you, so you'll have to keep an eye on your health barI hope the developers can address some of these issues in a future update (although the damage is already done to the brand), but until then...this game is just a travesty on all fronts."

The departure from the survival horror genre into a shooting game trying to copy the L4D is bad enough, but it's not even a good quality game for that genre.Boring, uninspired and not worth your time when you could be playing a better horror game or a better action game depending on what you want."

For 13 hours playing and fixing some bugs was fun, but I give up because there is always a new problem.

,Recommended,275060,23732228,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Konachibi,"I'm going to go against the general opinion here when I say that I do recommend this game, at least, I do since the June 2016 patch.Alone In The Dark: Illumination suffers from one major design flaw that's caused it garner such hate from it's audience... the fact that it's called Alone In The Dark.  Whilst I am a small fan of the AITD franchise, I am also open-minded when first playing a video game and play them without expectations or immediate judgement.  Alone In The Dark this game certainly is not, as it features nothing of the tropes that the franchise normally features, what it IS though is a competant and fun third-person horror/action game.You enter the game with a selection of 4 playable characters, each with their own unique skills and weaponry.  as you progress through the game, you gain XP resulting in level ups, that award skill points to bolster your abilities to take on tougher challenges.Visually, the game doesn't look too bad.  It's not bleeding-edge top-of-the-line graphics, but it's good enough for the atmosphere the game creates.  Audio too is done quite well, players will often find themselves thrown off by the sounds of the enemies as they distract you from where the attack will come from, and with the player given the story by a narrator that sounds like he's reading from a H.P Lovecraft novel, it all blends together quite nicely.  And whilst on the subject, some of the inspiration towards the enemies and story in this game comes straight from Lovecraft, which is a niche more games developers really should capitalise on because there's such great source material.Gameplay is rather interesting.  Enemies are invincible whilst in darkness, leaving your character very weak and vunerable to them if they should get close enough or manage to box you in.  The only way to fight them is luring them into areas of light, such as lamp-posts, ceiling lights, flood lights, torches, candles etc.  Anything that generates light will weaken the enemy and make them killable.  This often causes the player to run from one light source to another hoping to always stay ahead of the enemy, and it can create some quite tense moments, especially if you play single-player, as ammunition and pick-ups for your abilities aren't as abundant when you need them the most.  Not only that but some light sources will burn out after a minute or so, and since some maps do have you back-tracking to carry things to something else, strategic use of lights along the way is essential.As mentioned, the June 2016 update greatly improved the state of the game.  Upon it's original launch, it had the same problems that Umbrella Corps (which released only a few days ago) currently has.  A terrible camera, poor animations, buggy and glitchy hit detection, poor audio, brainless enemy A.I and so on.  With the recent patch though, AITD: Illumination now has a significantly better camera, full narration to the story, enemy A.I is actually quite smart, often trying to sneak up on the player or lure them away from the light.  As well as that, the skill progression system has seen a complete rework, allowing players to build their chosen character around a playstyle of their choosing, and all the characters have had some kind of change or tweak to them, such as the Witch having her pistol taken away in favour of her ability to shoot lightning and create light orbs.If you choose to play this game, try and convince a friend or two to give it a go with you, and you'll probably find it to be a lot of fun.  Don't start it up thinking it'll be an Alone In The Dark game, instead just see it as a stand-alone third person horror shooter with no ties to existing franchises, and you'll find it to be a very competant game."

However it takes its combat inspiration from alan wake but unlike that game it’s not very fleshed out and the creatures don’t really have a mind of their own.  They just come into the light waiting for their bullet which makes the game feel more like a shooting gallery.  The animations feel a little stiff as well but that is a pretty small issue.  I like the skill system, but like the combat it can use a little more thought into it.  I know this game is in the early stages of development and there is probably more that will be added later on.  I think if the AI was a lot smarter and the way you can dispose of them was a lot more creative this can be really something special.  I like the location and the concept, but the gameplay feels very generic.  I mean the creatures look scary and it should feel like a game of cat and mouse with lights going on and off.  Also there are some many things you can do with the light/dark concept for combat, survival and teamwork that it kinda makes me wonder if more effort is focusing on the things other than the gameplay.  Time will tell and I do not regret my purchase because this GAME HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL!"

,Recommended,275060,16309981,"Posted: 11 June, 2015",all,K~Mart_Security™,"The game mechanics are like Killing Floor, you choose a class, kill monsters for experience, and basically you try to accumalate as much kills as you can in a round, since experience only adds up at the end of each map. If you die, it totals up accumalated points and adds it to your experience pool, and you can choose where you want to distribute your skill points.Graphics wise, well they seem a bit dated, I want to say a mix between Deus ex human revolution and the new Killing Floor 2 graphics.The game is in over shoulder third person, kind of like how you would play the Resident Evil 5.Gameplay, hmm ok so far they don't despawn, monsters keep coming so basically there is no rest. Try to reach objectives and kill at the same time, while monsters respawn. A very team oriented game. Got my butt kicked in when playing single player.Do I recommend this game at full price? Nah, just wait till it goes on sale. It's a good game if your looking for time kill. Just don't expect much. I mean I am currently running the game on epic quality and it looks sub-standard, on a GTX 970."
,Recommended,275060,16324474,"Posted: 12 June, 2015",all,Starfallen,"From playing 2hours and getting to the last map of the first campaign as an engineer, The first few maps on coop, third map on solo.TLDR; [ Good coop game, current state value about $20, get it at current price if you have cash to spare. Make sure you have friends to play with, as there is seldom anyone playing this game. Game has almost no story content or cutscenes/voice. If you dont mind not having an engaging story and just want a blast with your friends doing objectives and staving off the hordes of enemies. If you liked Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil etc. ]Good:-Level design is interesting, certainly keeps the tension feel to it.-Use of light sources help build tension as you cannot just run and gun, you need to use light spots strategically. Light spots have finite use lengths, so you cannot just run aorund lighting everything up.-Abilities actually help.-Coop has a good feel to it and it is actually fun in coop. Coop and unlockables add to replayability.-Infinite ammo pistol. This is a personal favorite.-General gameplay feels good, and the game presentation is nice. Guns sound and feel good, killing monsters are quite satisfying.-Classes are decent enough.-Randomized objectives.Can be improved:-Game is a ghost town, literally. I have only ever found one coop game on listing and every other time I have tried since then there are no games at all. Coop in this game has potential but if there is nobody playing it kind of defeats the whole purpose.-The monster that shoots the acid spit is currently game breaking. There is no audio indication when such monster spawns behind you and shoots an acid at you. Getting hit by an acid is too damaging. A loud audio indication would be good to warn the player there is one charging up a spit when it spawns behind. Which brings us to.-Monster spawns. Having an infinitely spawning horde is great for keeping tension and challenge. However, there are issues currently with how the monsters spawn. They seem to spawn out of nowhere even in places you just walked by 5 seconds ago. It would be great if monsters could spawn by crawling out of vents, etc..-AI, I am sure many would agree with this as there are quite a number of issues with the AI. The monsters will tend to lose aggro for no reason and just stop there staring into space. They also tend to get stuck behind objects and walls. I would love to see the AI being reworked such that these issues do not occur.-AI issues and the light sources. The unique part in this game about how monsters cannot be damaged unless in a light spot is currently being affected by the AI. AI will sometimes just stop chasing before it enters a light spot, making the player need to actively try to aggro it again and pull it into a source. The light source issue extends especially to the acid spitting monster. Because it trie to engage you at range, it often just shoots you from outside the range of a light source. This is frustrating because the player now needs to reposition entirely outside of the light in order to force the spitter's range to walk into the light. This is an issue when playing solo as you also have to deal with hordes of other monsters.(Again solo because coop is ghost townish)-Other minor issues such as the blast radius of detonation objectives being actually bigger than what is shown, blasts always cause all ambient sounds to just abruptly stop.Concerns about the game's future:-Finishing the first campaign in around 2-3 hours, and there are only three campaigns, it might seem that the game length would be rather short. This might afffect replayability. Especially since you only have two abilities and a defined weapon set, you dont ge to unlock new stuff to play around with, instead you level just to improve your stats.-The game does not have any story at all. No voice acting, no cutscenes, and the 'story' is given through white text on the bottom left corner of the map. It would have been great if there was a story developing the characters and how they get out of this situation, motives etc. Needs more voice acting.-Barely anyone knows about this game. It is not on steam news, not on featured page, infact I only know about this game because i was scrolling the Steam coop listings and chanced upon it. Almost everyone I know has no clue this game even exists.-The game so far feels like a demo of a really good game which has the potential if developed with a story, better AI, more content, and more people knowing about it. Of course, it might be too late now, but who knows? If the developers decide one day to pick this up again with a larger budget and a team dedicated to making a great game out of this, we might have one of the best coop games of the year."

,Not Recommended,275060,32177475,Posted: 4 June,all,Totohli,"This game is not worth playing!Why? Because it has tons of issues and the decent things the game has to offer can't make up for it.Enemies getting stuck against walls or by blocking each other (which isn't a big deal as a player but it just dumbs down the experience even more), the light mechanic just slows the game down instead of making it fun or interesting. You use a light source, you wait for enemies to (slowly) walk towards it so you can finish them off, after a while you'll just run past everything just to rush to your objective(s). The Co-Op is bad because of random disconnects and my friend had a hard time hearing me with the in-game voice chat. The levels in the game are good on a visual aspect, they don't look too much alike but the objectives you have to do just repeat themselves. You either get 3 wires, 3 batteries or start up a generator to proceed, there's not much fun doing it and the fact that your stamina gets drained makes it even more tedious to do them at a walking pace.The sound in the game is bad, the ambient music in some levels is just annoying and sometimes explosions don't have sounds or the in game commentary simply doesn't play. In co-op it gets even worse, when my teammate was reloading his weapon it just 'stayed in place'. What i mean is that he starts his reload on my right and he's walking around at the same time, i kept on hearing his reload sound on my right and it was pretty loud as well. This is annoying if you have to hear it every 10 seconds.I played through the game as the Engineer, and it might've been the most boring class it had to offer.The only thing i had to offer was the fact that i could repair light sources that had already been used, do you need this?No. Just run for 10 seconds and you'll find a new light source to use and after that you'll probably be proceeding through the level. The Engineer has a shotgun, some sort of mines and a pistol. The pistol is ok on easy/medium difficulty and the shotgun can deal with enemies rather easily even without a light source. The mines on the other hand... they didn't trigger most of the time (especially when you place them while an enemy is close) and they just felt useless.At the end of a chapter there is an 'arena' type 'boss' fight. You kill a certain enemy that drops something that will help you deal damage to the objective. This seemed interesting the first time but it just repeats every time.It became problematic (for me as the Engineer - Solo) at the final battle, suddenly it became a HUGE bullet sponge and my pistol didn't do to much damage and my shotgun was my best friend for the enemies i encountered before. I had to repeat the same thing 4-5 times when suddenly my game ended, i failed... i still had like 30% of his health bar to deplete and i can't imagine doing more damage to finish the job. I gave up and i don't regret it."
,Not Recommended,275060,33224983,Posted: 4 July,all,Armitage,"Plenty of better options out there for co-op based first person shooters. This is a very generic and boring offering. Lacks diversity of enemies, and isn't very pretty to look at. Doesn't at all feel like an Alone in the Dark title. Also gives no feeling of being in a Lovecraftian setting. I'd write a more indepth review, but it's seriously just not worth it."
