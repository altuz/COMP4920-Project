,Not Recommended,275080,12296511,"Posted: 29 September, 2014",all,K!netic,"I created a pair of post offices, staffed them, bought them vehicles and a few amenities, set routes and fixed prices. All of that took roughly ten minutes. I spent the next 50 minutes doing other things in real life. I cooked some soup, put together a decent sandwich (it even had some lemon zest in it), made a banana split, went to the bathroom, and got some things from my car that I'd forgotten earlier in the day. The whole time, the game was at 3x speed. I occasionally hit ""ok"" on the dialog that told me the day was over, but most of my time was afk.I came back to the game and found that after a week, nothing interesting had happened. My operation flowed smoothly and made me a good return. Given a month I could open another office, given a year and I could probably edge out my competition with decent advertisements and expanded service.Here's the thing - the game played itself. All i did was set it up. There's no management, the prices were already reasonable, there were never any problems, and I didn't have to do anything. Other tycoon games give you a reason to keep playing - more things to build, more people to attract, more stuff to see. This one doesn't - it's over as soon as you've finished setting it up. It's barren and simple. It's so simple that I can't recommend it, because you won't get anything out of it, unless you're looking for a screensaver that doesn't move, but takes ten minutes to set up.Glancing over the developer's history, it seems clear that this is common. Produce a bargain bin game that's very simplistic, release a new one every couple months. And hey, they apparently make enough money to stay afloat, so cheers to that. Given how many games I play that were made by people who tried 10x as hard and came out roughly equal to this one, I can't really decry someone who is literally in business making this sort of thing."

So you should consider that before buying this game.. If you ask for my suggestion about to buy it or not, I'd still buy it, but at hell big discount, like 90% at least.This is the link to their first ever, and last seen updatehttp://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791435159972/announcements/detail/1424570746448987052This is the link for their so called ""community suggested updates"", which was never really botheredhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/275080/discussions/0/540734792228897478/********************************************This game doesn't have complex systems as compared to most of the sims out there, so I'll say this is a beginner friendly for those who are new to simulation games. However, I would not recommend it to those who are looking for sim with complex and advance system like Cities in Motion series. If you getting this, you should really get it while it's on sale! Okay ._. enough of my boring talk, let's take a look at my reviewOverall game play rating : 7.4/10 (average of whatever score i gave below)Money Value : 4/10For $14.99, I personally think it's a bit too high, so grab it while it's on sale! The game should be around $4.99 in my opinion. (YES, I'm cheapskate x_x) Again, grab it while it's on sale!Graphic presentation : 10/10Kinda old school isometric artwork, it's simple, it's clean, it's neat, it's beautiful.BGM : 7/10You don't get to choose your BGM, but the existing one is good enough for us to play with.User Interface : 7/10Everything is simple enough, it's easy to learn and easy to monitor, but there's no hot key binded to any of them.Simplicity : 9/10Yes, the game is really simple, you probably won't go bankrupt any time soon. But it's still fun!Cons:- The game is slow... Even with the speed option, it's still slow at max speed... (might improve soon, because people are really complaining bout this).- Though the game's graphic seems really simple, the recommended processor is at dual core 2.4 GHz, I'm running it on Core i5 1.6 GHz, living in warm climate (about 32 degree celcius outside at afternoon), it caused my laptop to overheat without proper air ventilation (fancy word for getting table fan and cooling pad to give my laptop a blow jo...b).Pros:- The game is not dead! I mean, there's still update for improvement and bug fixes!- The game is not complex! (for those who don't like complicated sims)"
,Recommended,275080,9378382,"Posted: 7 March, 2014",all,CarbonRevenge,"Post Master is an intriquing game. You have the ability to run your own privately ran post service much of the likes of UPS and FedEx. You start out in a medium sized post office in a small commercial city and you're trying your best to get your mail service up and running by getting workers for your post office, a fleet of vehicles, and their routes assigned. The game starts out slow though as you're only running a limited amount of routes and trying to invest in infastructure to increase your mail coverage of the local area. It's quite enjoyable. I haven't played much as of yet though I can at least give a brief overview of the features.You basically micromanage both your post offices keeping track of demand of your business while trying your best to get enough service. You can invest in new vehicles, add amenities to your post offices to keep customers/employees happy, and also hire enough employees such as customer service(front desk workers) and sorters. In the garage, you can choose the vehicles you want to buy but you must first unlock them as well as other things via Bonus Stars which are an alternative currency of sorts which is earned via the Missions system or District Competitions. These bonus stars unlock items to place in your post office, new vehicles, and helps pay for advertising runs. Vehicles though are from bicycles to big trucks with fuel cost, maintence, etc becoming higher but also allowing you to use less vehicles and take in more demand by increase storage capacity of the vehicles.However, you're also competing against rival companies for a market and coverage. Offer the best coverage, best priced service, and you might be able to conquer a city. On my current playthrough, i'm trying to get a hold of the commercial market in town before moving onto another town entirely. I have my competition on me but i'm currently at the biggest advantage in terms of price and coverage. I've invested alot in infastructure and i'm sitting at at over 60% of the market of the town as mine. Competition is a great feature of any serious business sim or any sim in general as it keeps you on your toes. It means that I must constantly invest in new infastructure in order to keep a hold of the market. It's stressful and fun all at the same time.The last thing is the graphics and music. The game style reminds me of Sim City, plays a little like Transport Tycoon, but it more focused on mail as being the games title. The music is calming but I wouldn't listen to it for extended play as i'd recommend for any deep sim fan who will spend hours on one game. The game also has very nice ambiance which without music would really bring the world to life. It's the one thing that I like hearing because it makes it feel like a real place. Kind of wish though there was vehicle traffic of general traffic as it would add alot to the game. It's great as is though and if any future updates come then I think i'll put tons of hours into it.So, if you're into micromanagement, I recommend this game. It's worth the price. Not expensive, not too cheap. You get what you pay for and it's awesome.Edit: So this review has been sitting here awhile but i'd like to add that the dev did one or two updates then abandoned the game. There's some short little fun in it every once in awhile but it's not a game that'll dedicate all your time. It's fun is the equivalent of a mobile game."

Unlike games like prison architect, this game only has one thing to do: buy trucks and deliver mail. This game would be ok if it were a 99 cent mobile game but is in no way worth $14.99 though I have seen games worse than this before, this was the first of the terrible games that I was tricked into buying via false advertizing. Do not buy this game."

Sadly there is no form of ease of use menu management it is point and click each item indivualy and repeat whenever you want to add a new vehicle. There is no buy X amount or saved vehicle settings for creating a new vehicle. The simplest way to fix this is to have a menu specificly for the different type of mail vehicles have a global < local < individual settings. Where the global and local only need to be read when the vehicle is created to set the default. What it also needs is a place multiple function where with mailbox you have click confirm on each indivual one later on I ended up placing 100 at once so either a drag box selection or confirm after you selected both or even better incorporate both. These are fatal flaws that make the game tedious to play. Other than that it's fun.
,Not Recommended,275080,9870792,"Posted: 19 April, 2014",all,Emjay,Nice idea but lacks complexity.Possibly one of the most shallow tycoon type games ive ever played. You can pretty much unlock and have done everything within the first day. After that its just increasing the size of your business which seems to be free to do whatever it wants as theres no competition.Somewhat disappointing.
,Not Recommended,275080,9985688,"Posted: 30 April, 2014",all,Lictor,"Okay.  Where to start...Graphics:  Very simple, cartoony buildings and landscapes.  The game almost looks like a slightly polished SimCity 2k, right down to the building models.  It's uncanny.  In the large post office garages, the vehicle interaction and information tabs actually go outside the border of the building screen, and can be hard to see with the city in the background.Audio:  Not a lot of variety in the background music loop.  Note the singular noun there.  It all sounds the same.  Sound effects and incidentals are okay.Control:  Clickdrag to pan the window gets a little annoying at times.  I'd also like the ability to zoom out further to save me the trouble.Interface:  Simple, but it works 95% of the time.  An area I would suggest for polishing would be for changes in paths and other variables to go into effect while the game is paused instead of having to unpause the game, then pause it again to go back to what you were doing.Gameplay:  Incredibly uninspired.  A sim junkie can figure out how to game the engine within the first hour or so.  Get both your first and second post offices fully developed (which can take maybe two hours after you've taken the engine back behind the tool shed), and you can then just leave it running and walk away while the money pours in.  On medium difficulty, I completed all of the ""missions"" and eliminated my AI competitor by day 45 or so using the walk-away method.Bugs:  Surprisingly few and far between.  Kudos on this.Final thoughts:  This is a very shallow game across the board, definitely not worth the full $15.00 price tag.  This game is categorized under the ""casual games"" category, and should have been priced as such (if this were maybe half the price, it'd be a little bit more reasonable and falls in line with the one-and-done depth).  Save your money and spend it on something with a lot more teeth and replay value."

And, after the workday ends, the clock continues to slowly increment instead of switching to the next day. It doesn't have much depth, but I wouldn't mind that as long as I could actually play the game. Instead, it feels like a screensaver after the first ten minutes. Perhaps if the game devs address the speed issue I will play it again, but as of right now it feels unplayable."

,Not Recommended,275080,24548745,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,[nBn] CJ,"This game is kinda awful.  I bought it when it was on sale because I wanted the trading cards/badge.  I enjoy stamp collecting as a hobby, and I thought a PostMaster badge would be cute.  I tried to play the game though and... It's like a cheap, awkward, and really boring SimCity.I thought the instructions/controls were a bit confusing.  Or maybe they aren't and I was just too bored to really care to figure them out.  It's not like it really matted, It didn't feel like there's really any reward for doing a good job.And maybe these faults could have been forgiven if it actually felt postal related.  As I said before, I bought this because I have an interest in stamps and postal history.  If it were just a boring game I'd probably be okay with enjoying some cute postal imagery.  Unfortunately the whole thing looks uninspired.  There's nothing really to even signify you are running a post office or package delivery.  If it weren't for the shadows of generic post box shapes, I could easily assume I was running a bus route, street cleaner, ice cream truck, etc.  The most post office imagery you'll find in this game is from the trading cards."

Excalibur brings a neat little simulation-lite that will tickle your management requirements without drowning you in complicated elements.Take your post office to the top, crush your rival and own the city. As the game continues, the city expands and the oppurtunities increase, this also means you're constantly having to re-think post office placement and routes.My one gripe in the game is that there is only a single rival post office, having multiple rivals would be fun for people who find one rival too easy - you can eliminate them from the game completely."

Some even compared it to OTTD which seems rather harsh to me because they are so different. So I will give my 2 cents so far.This is not the best game ever, yet it is not a bad game either as portrayed by many here. You choose a difficulty. Set up your employees (post sorters, customer handling and security) and vehicles (bikes to trucks with each different costs and benefits). For each vehicle you have to set the service it will do (post collection or delivery for instance) and its specific route and working hours. After a while you want to expand and buy more offices to increase your coverage of the cities and thus increase your customer satisfaction (reputation). You earn stars for being better than your competitor and some generic missions like build 5 vehicles. Stars are needed for unlocking upgrades and advertisement.The tutorial is also not horrible. It does what it needs to do, although it has some spelling errors in them. The game is quite easy to get into. So if you want a more casual game than for instance OTTD, then I recommend it.I personally paid 2 euro for the bundle and I don't feel ripped of about it at all.Some also complained about the dev's not supporting this anymore. I have played 3 hours so far and I have only encountered 1 bug in which a popup appeared where it shouldn't. However this did not effect my game in any (negative) way. So honestly I think the devs delivered a nice little working game.Someone said before that you can make soup in the mean time: that is true. This is overall very laid back and you do not have to micromanage except for the priority deliveries which you have to assign a vehicle to. Apart from that, I only had to micromanage when I bought new vehicles and I would readjust all routes so no routes would overlap."

Although the game has a somewhat small scope, it offers me the critical 'fun' part (in contrast to certain other ""XXXX Simulator 201X"" games (all by the same publisher *ahem*)) and I really enjoy playing it.

The only downside might be that it can be quite a watch-and-wait game sometimes, but for 11,99€ I would certainly recommend this."

I would also like to see the map being alot bigger as I found it very restrictive so maybe when you conquer one area another place gets revealed as this then stops the game being limited.I feel that first glance this game is very confusing and at the start I know it is the first hour or so I played I did terrible I tried again and did I think that you need to play the game for quite a while to make it good."

I like Transport-, and Railroad Tycoon and a lot more of these types of games. The fun is only in the beginning to set up the routes. After everybody do dear jobs, their is nothing to do. No disasters, no bomb packages, just boring after a while. But for the time it takes to set it up and the price of 0,99 it's a ""yes"" for me.+Paid only 0,99$Random city'sSetting up the entire logistics-Boring after everything is managedlag of differences in gameplayno disasters to get you back to work7/10"

No multiplayer which is a shame as I see that being a decent move forward, having said that it would take a while to win versus a human.Definitely good value."

But even a minimally experienced player will likely find it lacking in depth and challenge.  While I can easily point out several things that could use improvement, I find myself hard pressed to choose something that this game does well.- Control over your business is minimal and easily maxed out given a little time.  There are very few upgrades to speak of beyond vehicles.- While you can easily upgrade a vehicle from one type to the next, you can not do the same with your facilities.  Instead you must wait for another location to randomly become available for sale.- When a new facility spot becomes available, the prices can vary drastically, and may not even be capable of housing the size of facility you need.  No information is given to why this is.- Other upgrades within your facility are quickly unlocked, incredibly cheap, and give no real indication of how they effect your business.  Upgrades improve “customer/staff morale” but no hard data is given to how this effects your business.- You can spend money training your employees, but the effect is temporary.  If your staff is over-worked by physical load, it makes more sense to open another facility rather than trying to train them.- All of this is over-shadowed by the mysterious “fault” graph.  You are told, the higher a number is the worse the problem, but aren’t given any parameters as to what they are measuring.  You start with “Coverage” at near 100% “fault” but can open two more facilities in your starting town that will allow you to give every service to every block in your first town and it will only drop to maybe 85% “fault.”- “Competitor Fault” is another bit of information it gives, stating that it means “your competitor has better prices and coverage.”  But again, there’s no useful feedback to what that means.  What price are they transporting at?  Where are they taking business from?  You can see their offices and sometimes their vehicles, but nothing useful enough to actually compete.- The only thing that really requires an immediate reaction is “high-priority packages.”  Little mission bubbles that pop up every once in awhile.  You designate a vehicle solely to transport these; quick responses reward money and stars to unlock upgrades.  But keeping a dedicated courier for those packages is not worth the investment.  Package events may happen once every couple of in-game days and the reward could be easily passed if that same vehicle worked on deliveries/pick-ups  instead.In the end, every facet of the game can be improved upon.  There eventually came a point where I had no real connection to what I was doing. The colored sliders would go up and down, but there was no real feedback.  I had no idea how things were being changed.  I was watching a screen-saver of driving ants and climbing numbers.  Even at the discounted $3 I spent, I don’t feel I got my money’s worth."

I've spent hours and hours playing Transport Tycoon, Railroad Tycoon, Industry Giant, and city builders like SimCity, Caesar, and Pharaoh. Unfortunately, it's been quite a few years since a good one has come along, so I was happy to see Post Master and gave it a try!*small update to this review: Unfortunately, the developers haven't bothered to make updates and improvements, and I haven't felt the desire to play this game anymore at all. There are lots of better games to spend your money on.*I tried it for several hours, and although it is addictive, the game experience doesn't change. Basically, you're doing the same thing from the beginning. Yes you can buy new offices and expand your business, but running a 2-office business is the same as running 10 offices. You open the office, select your vehicles, plan their tasks and routes, and then try to keep an eye on volume of mail being handled.This game has a lot of room for improvement, and I truly hope the developers will delve into it further to create a more in-depth experience. It's a nice game, but I do believe this has the potential to become more than that!My suggestions:-Allow to upgrade existing post offices.-Allow to skip to end of day.-Get a daily status report with details about income and expenses. How much money do you actually make from letters and packages? How much do you spend on maintenance, fuel, paychecks?-Better and more detailed graphs. It is very hard to see the big picture here.-Efficiency report for each vehicle, are they actually making money? Is the vehicle too big or too small for the actual volume of mail, or is it making too many or not enough trips to handle their cargo?-The ability to upgrade a vehicle, to make it faster or expand the cargo space.-Distribution centers where mail gets sorted.And I'd love to see the game develop over time, like unlocking things, seeing the city expand, adding more elements to the game:-Trains, airplanes and boats to deliver your mail-Adding more different types of mail, unlocking over time, requiring to build specialty buildings and/or vehicles.Examples: international letters and packages (in combination with trains and airplanes), magazines, advertisement, catalogs, extra heavy packages, fragile packages, and maybe even love letters, christmas cards, birthday cards, party invitations (Yes I know those are realisticly not treated as seperate mail, but I'd love to see more elements in this game)-In-game companies that ship items using your (or the competitor's) services. For example bookstores, game stores, clothing shops. Business can expand, shrink, or even go broke depending on how their deliveries are being handled.-A feature from Transport Tycoon: being able to donate funds to a city, so the city will expand, improve infrastructure, allow new businesses to develop etc.And please, add a campaign or scenario maps!"
