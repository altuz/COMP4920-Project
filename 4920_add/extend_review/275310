Not simple helm commands. left right midships.There is no way to speed up the gameplay. It has two speeds. Snails Pace - and slightly faster snail.It's a junker of a game - and over priced.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY

Little to customize, wait... scratch that... nothing to customize even sound and graphics left me feeling empty. A hole opened up inside my soul and destroyed what little faith I had in a universal force for good. I no longer believe in anything because of Victorian Admirals Anthology. Please, for the love of whatever God is left in the universe, do not buy this game. It is a waste of 20 valuable dollars. Think about what you could do with that 20! Buy a Nautilus skin or send your kid to community college! Think about it, please... just think."

I was excited when I saw the screen shots of the ship models... but that turned out to be the only positive about the game. The controls are EXTREMELY limited and there is no setting area to change them. Also, you can only choose to fight 6 or so battles. As for the battles themselves... they consist of the player watching helplessly as your ships fire small puffs of white smoke at the enemy with sound effects which fail to bring about any form of excitement."

So, I picked a battle, and had no idea what I was supposed to do. I turns out that your only options are telling the ship formations (not even individual ships) to speed up, slow down, go left, or go right. Then, you sit back and watch them beat the crap out of each other. That's it. I walked away from the computer during a battle for 15 minutes and came back because there was nothing for me to do.It is a fascinating time period, and I'm going to force myself to play the scenarios so I can get some hint of my money's worth. If you're a fan of that period, then $3 might be worth the price, but not more than that."

While an interesting time period and some good artwork the play is... well, very disapointing to say the least. You basically set course and speed and sit back and watch the game play itself."

Do you like funding some kids school project.  Well this game is for you and not everyone else.  Its unfinished and hardly a game.  The game lasts for so long and its like you have special needs kids behind every gun on the ship.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  This game is a huge skip dont fund this kids trustfund.

76561198004729621,Not Recommended,275310,13474294,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,Tigdam,"Stay away from this game. When I first saw this series it seemed like a brilliant idea, ironclad vs ironclad hasn't really been done before but the game is completly uninished and has a complete lack of almost evreything. It takes forever to play even a single engagement, you can't control your guns, you can only control a few ships at a time not the whole fleet, no custom battles or even any customisation of the game at all, you can't even get a list of the key bindings and in all honesty I baught this at 90% off on a steam sale. I wish I hadn't waisted my money. Very few people will find this game worth any amount of time because there is really nothing to do at all and you'll be bored out of your mind so you're much better off going saving your money and doing some digging for another game"
,Not Recommended,275310,21591060,"Posted: 2 March, 2016",all,Daltron,"Game pretty much completely leaves out the player, all you can do is control the rudder in three positions. No gun control, no damage control, target selection, speed, nothing.Not worth 99 cents, much less $20. This is the gaming equivalent of a gofundme account for someone who's broke because they had three kids and blew their welfare check on cigarettes and vodka."
76561198305801559,Recommended,275310,26521622,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,Historyplayer,"I really enjoy historical naval combat games and that was the reason I have titles such as Empire, Napoleon and Shogun 2 Total War Fall of the Samurai. Then, I had been researching about 19th century naval warfare but unfortunately there are not trully interest aside Totem Games and Fall of the Samurai DLC to make games set in this fascinating era.Victorian Admirals is focused on 4 historical scenarios set in 1880s: Caroline Island Crisis 1885; Panama Crisis 1885; Marianas Incident 1887; Samoan Crisis 1889. The ships of the period are transitional between sailing ships and pre-dreadnought with steam powered engines. There is a great variety of ship models including gunboats, light and heavy frigates and monitors. The ship models are trully detailed, especially the damage textures, and the environment graphics look good as well with beautiful colors set in the Pacific and Caribbean. I also enjoy the engine and cannon sounds.For those who complain about the lack of customization, the game is indeed customizable. Just go to Victorian Admirals and you will find a file Config where you can customize video settings and sounds settings, including music if you don't want to hear music while playing or to lower the volume of the music. I have this game maxed out and the graphics improve substantially, take a look at my video on youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-fGpl1Ll_wI am glad Totem Games has another games covering other conflicts of this era: American Civil War, Chincha Islands War, Anglo-Russian War among others. The next title of Ironclads II War of the Pacific will cover another new and exciting conflict between Peru and Chile. I Can't wait for the release!!"

It really needs a update so that it can add more game content since it is really missing alot. Maybe somthing like a skermish mode would be nice. I would give this game a 4/10 since it is lacking in most parts of the game. But still it is a ok navel battle game.
,Recommended,275310,9124721,"Posted: 15 February, 2014",all,Gilad Pellaeon,"It is incredible... An amazing idea for naval battles in 1880's, before world fleets evolved into all metel goliathans, turned super boring with only four playable scenarios; no campaign, no skirmishes. After you play the four scenarios, then what? Also, the shooting disturbs me; you can't control the ship's shooting and they can run away from the main fleet, so you can't even control each ship's movement. Da♥♥♥♥?"
76561198007585740,Not Recommended,275310,18125280,"Posted: 20 September, 2015",all,DrVesuvius,"Another very poor offering from Totem Games latest in their ""Ironclads"" series.  The name may have changed but the game has barely evolved from 2010's Ironclads High Seas.  Even the in-game music sounds strangely familiar...In this game you have a selection of about five different scenarios.  Each battle is a simple open-sea fleet action - no islands or other terrain.  The in-battle UI has changed a little, but the gameplay remains fundamentally the same - you can direct the speed and course of each squadron of ships and choose whether ships can fire at will or hold their fire.  And that's it.  You can't control individual ships, you just steer the leader and the other ships blindly follow.  If the second or third ship in a squadron is at risk of colliding with another ship, there is absolutely nothing you can do to avoid it.  You can't target ships guns, or choose different ammunition types, and there's no firefighting or damage control functions.To put things in perspective, I'm a tabletop wargamer and history buff.  I love the Ironclad naval era.  I was absolutely bored to tears by this game, and resent having paid full price for it.  Even if it's on sale, don't bother.  However cheap it is, you won't get your money's worth."
