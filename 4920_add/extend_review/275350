The controls haven't been properly reworked for PC, the slider where you select your mission is slightly bugged (clearly intended to be swiped with a finger and just badly ported over for mouse), and the graphics are poorly detailed when viewed on a normal sized computer monitor or TV.I think if these guys had just put in a bit more effort, it could have been a good port. As it is for now, there are better tower defense games to be played instead."

Not a maze builder.After about 30 minutes of play, it appears to just be a bug free, direct port, of the mobile version. That is not necessarily a bad thing. I already own the android version and have beaten it before. Too many mobile to PC ports are buggy right off the start. So far this works fine for me in either full screen or windowed mode. Thumbs up to a smooth mobile to PC transition for the Devs.It’s a good addition for fans of the genre, especially if you don’t already have it on your tablet or phone. This is best for those that prefer a more 2D tower defense where you focus on upgrades and tower placement like Onslaught, Fieldrunners, iBomber Defense, or Defender’s Quest.If you prefer a more complex fully 3D tower defense that uses more of the PC’s gaming power I’d recommend checking out Prime World: Defenders, Dungeon Defenders, Sanctum (1 or 2), or Defense Grid.I enjoy both the simple 2D and complex 3D Tower Defense games. So I was more than happy to add Sentinel 3 to my Steam collection."

The more difficult it gets the longer it takes to clear the stages (it actually doesnt raise the difficulty) so its always easy. It just takes forever, It's will slowly drain the life out of your soul,2 campains / 40lvls of the same stuff, 4 difficulty settings = 160, + endless and challenge mode = i dont know 40 more / 200 levelsA level usually takes 20min on easy and up to and hour on hardest, on endless mode its infinite so if you want to beat the game, its atleast 200hours. And it's the same thing over and over again, you dont need to think or do, just sit there and watch for 200hours, sounds like fun right? well it's not!"
,Recommended,275350,10149330,"Posted: 17 May, 2014",all,Lin,"This game BARELY cuts the mark for that yes, and it's for the reason everyone assumes: the port is clearly an afterthought and I was never allowed to forget that while playing. For example, I eventually started pausing mid level every time I wanted to upgrade a tower, because actually selecting one with the mouse is a hit and miss thing - it tries to grab and slide the screen instead, which is utterly useless since the whole map fits fine in my screen. And don't start me on the level selection slider. The appropriate asking price tipped the scale towards yes for me.That huge aside aside, this is a solid tower defense game of the more traditional variety, with fixed paths and some interesting mechanics - just don't expect a reinvention of the wheel. The maps of the campaigns repeat once too often for my liking, however they're intersting enough and at times challenging. I like the difficulty, though the curve can occasionally be steep and some grinding seems to be encouraged. It is mildly addictive, the graphics are fine and scale alright, the music is okay but can get very repetitive. All in all, as TDs go this one is lukewarm: decent, not great, not bad.Pet peeve: It's really sparse on information about the levels, the enemies, the towers and the upgrades. I especially miss details on the enemy types (an icon and a level are not info enough in my book). More practical details at the level selection page would also help plan what towers/weapons to pack along. However, since many of the maps are pretty solidly geared towards one or two winning strategies, you could consider that part of the design: this is less a plan ahead and stratgize sort of TD and more a ""jump right in and take the hits as they come"" one. Personally, I consider the lack of information just another sign of a game made for smaller screens and less reading.So buy? Yes, I suppose, if you're a TD fan and running dry. Especially if it's discounted and practically free. There are many MANY great TD games for PCs out there and this isn't one of them, but it gave me enough hours of fun to pay for itself."

With that said - game is not exactly bad, but it has a lot of flaws. But let's start with good part - game has lots of maps (35+), lots of modes and difficulties and nice interest system where you have to keep your defences to minimal, which adds to tactical part. That's about it for the good part.Now about bad stuff - first of all, game isreallylong. Each stage (except maybe very early ones) lasts at least an hour. On it's own that wouldn't be so bad, but you can't speed up the game more than 2x. Considering that some games has 3x, 5x, even 9x speed ups - very poor desicion. Next thing - in every stage to collect more money (and gain more interest money) you have to do your best to kill enemies withlou building anything. So you have to use abilities and your commander (yup, you have movable unit to help you) for a good 20-30% of the stage. Way to go for a TD, instead of tactical managing limited resourses you must jump around to collect money. Another bad thing is - there are basically only 8 types of enemies with small variations, nothing interesting really. If that was a game for 20-30 hours, it'd be ok, but game for 100h+? Definitely bad. And there is more! Towers are majorly disbalanced, by the end of the game you really need only 4-5 towers from given 12 - as if 12 was too much to make it more or less balanced. Well, that's it for big ones, i may also add couple small ones - bad graphics (but i guess if you play TD you don't care like me, still had to write about it), repetitive music (remember 100h+ of gameplay, on the other hand you can turn it down - again, like i did) and small glitch when you choose chapters, but that's not really an issue, just a bit annoying.So. After all that you may ask why i even put ""recommend"" on it. Well, not everyone completes games on 100%. If you want to complete campaign and leave, i suppose, it's not so bad. I give this game 5/10, because it's badly flawed and artificially prolonged, but you may still enjoy it. Just don't go too deep."

,Recommended,275350,12254970,"Posted: 26 September, 2014",all,AbyssalSoul,"So, you are piloting this huge power armor reminiscent of the Tau Commander from Warhammer 40k and one of those ugly robots from Avatar (the movie). Then imagine you are outnumbered, outgunned and outmaneuvered by an evil alien race with infinite numbers of weapons and units. But imagine that despite this, against all odds, you and a handful of auto-turrets and drones join forces and open fire at them while screaming ""THIS IS MY HOMEWORLD, WE WANT HOMEWORLD RELEASED ALREADY!! DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA!!""And boy by that glorious scream the dakka flows.That's Sentinel 3: Homeworld in a nutshell. A pretty fun tower defense, nowhere near the quality of a Defense Grid but damn fun! Special mention to the OST, which has some sort of trance-house style that reminded me of some PC games of old. Bad points for the surpride dubstep of the main menu theme though. But guess a giant bada$$ mech that stomps enemies and causes shockwaves can go all ""wub wub wub"" while firing twin miniguns.Another special mention to the Laser Tower, aka, the dubstep tower. Seriously, build laser towers and watch those rows of enemies burn all at the same time in a glorious rain of fire.Considering the game seens to go for sale frequently, this can be a great purchase indeed!"

,Recommended,275350,18905303,"Posted: 6 November, 2015",all,kschang77,"Sentinel 3 is an old-school ""fixed path"" tower defense game where you are to defend your outposts from all comers by deploying and upgrading turrets and prevent enemies from breaching your defense barriers and destroying your installations. They can only come certain ways along a path, and you can place turrets somewhere along this path. The special *schtick* of Sentinel 3 is you have a special commander unit on scene that can act as a mobile turret / repair / buff unit that you can upgrade and outfit separately from your arsenal of turrets. And that introduced a whole new aspect of tactical decision making for this genre.In a typical fixed-path tower defense, the path the enemy units walk on have already been defined and your decision is to choose which turrets to build where and when (and when to upgrade them). This is when you notice that the valid build spots are not that obvious. Instead of the valid tiles being highlighted, you need to slide your units across the spots to see which spots are ""green"" and which spots are ""red"" (not there). Once placed, you can spend further money to upgrade them to do more damage. exponentially more damage. Typical progression is each turret has 4 upgrades. The normal ""shooter"" turret is 1/2/4/8/50. You can see the ""maxed out"" turret does much more damage, at great cost. Other turrets are of similar ratio. The turrets are a typical mix: MG, bomb, slow, beam, flame, and so on.Between missions you can spend your XP credits to buy upgrades, such as additional turret slots so you can take more than one type of turrets into combat.The commander unit is the unique factor, in that it can be mobile (if you buy the jumpjet upgrade) and it has its own weapons to engage enemies, both from afar, and in melee. However, if it is destroyed, you lose! With sufficient upgrades, it can repair barriers that were previously damaged, as well as give an enhancement aura to turrets within range. Other capabilities, such as rage, fire support, and so on can also be added subject to the XP points.  As you level up, you gain access to more toys, and so on.There are 20 campaign missions, and about a dozen or so maps, and four different difficulty levels.The graphics are decidedly low-res by modern standards, but adequate, and music is nothing to write home about.All in all Sentinel 3 is a tower defense game with a twist. While it earns a recommendation, only buy it when it's on sale. The *schtick* is not enough to compensate for repetitive and often uninvolved gaep"

The playtime required to get a 100% achievements was too much, plus there was no count-down after the 100K aliens killed mark.

I own it both for the PC and Steam and I enjoy them both. The graphics are just fine and look good on my 1440p monitor. I do have a few complaints about the interface, though. To me, the space bar should pause the game, but it does not. Escape should open a menu, but it closes the game with no warning. This game also runs really hot on my video card. The fan on my GPU maxes out when this thing is running, so there must be some real inefficient code running behind the scenes. The game still works just fine, though. I would recommend this to anyone who likes TD. You can see samples of this playing in HD on youtube."

The levels are all very bland and ""samey,"" there are very few enemy types (although they can vary in strength amongst their kind), and it is very easy. The game never introduces anything which forces you to change your play style; your first two towers are all that you need to beat most every level.The game tries to add some spice to the typical TD recipe by including a commander unit who can move from one key point to another and engage the enemies directly, except that it isnt very well implemented. There is no penalty if he dies, and he doesnt really do much for a very long ways into the game. The key locations that he can guard are basically capable of handling themselves without his help, as long as you add one bomb turret and a couple of lasers.The game feels short, even though it takes awhile to beat. There are only a small number of maps available, so the game repeats several of them with ""different"" waves of enemies (which dont feel different at all due to the limited variety) and tries to extend gameplay by making you face absurdly high wave counts (50+ for most levels).I like TD games, and i have played a ton of them... but this game felt half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and amateur.

I'm making a thumb down review because Steam doesn't allow for neutral reviews, and they are many Tower Defenses that I would recommend before this one. The game has most of the basics of TD right, but it lacks anything special that would make it stand out of the crowded TD genre. On sale this could be an ok pick.+ The game as a fair amount of content, with 2 separate campaigns, 2 commanders with different abilities (you can play either campaigns with either commander), and 3 different play modes.+ The economy model is decent rewarding players who spend the less they can for each enemy waves.- The main issue, is that the various levels are a little too generic, this feeling is increased by the fact that waves are only made of one type of enemy at once, the game merely increasing the number and strength of those enemies. Overall many levels feel too long and repetitive. This may be fine for mobile gameplay but on PC it doesn't work so well. Several times, confident in my defense, I just pressed ALT-TAB and went on reading my mail or browsing the web, just monitoring the game from times to times in the taskbar with aeropeek and switching in only for the occasional boss waves. Here I should point that the second campaign was a bit better in this regard and offered a little more variation and slightly more interesting action.- Towers can only be placed on specific locations, no “mazing”. The background graphics sometime makes it hard to say if a specific square is build-able or not, this is an unfortunate oversight."

UI is so easy to use the game itself seems too easy - instead it needs some grinding. Tough / quick / flying enemies alternate with bosses while you try to balance your budget between improving or buying new towers.

I also like that there are many building locations -- I don't like the games where you only get a few preset locations for builidng towers.   There is some repeatability because there are different modes and levels of difficulty (and different loadouts of towers and commander abilities to choose from), and your commander unit slowly levels up."
,Not Recommended,275350,31273393,Posted: 21 April,all,N71,"As a fan of genre, I could say, so-so. If you are not one of us, I can't recommend.Pros:- Save game on exit, in the middle of fight. Not much Tower Defenses can offer it.- Campaign 2 is much better balanced, so you probably can enjoy the first half of it.Cons:- One wave - one enemy.- Interface are very unresponsive. You can stomp a gun tower 3 or 4 times, before it shows you an upgrade menu. Because map moves a few pixels up/down every time you click on battlefield.- Extremely linear path of the enemies. You can see 1-2 branches on higher levels. But you still may not use it, because- Extremely short playable in-game path. If you choose to defend first gates, you can build up your defense on 3-4 cells and win the level. I repeat, on most levels enemies don't go anywhere, just make a few steps by the stright line. So you can just throw out the rest of the map. This is not a bad balance, because here's the first gates and you probably should defend it at all cost. So, this is how it must be played.- Maps are repeating. Once I had the same map two times in a row. And won it with the same weapon setup. Why?- Levels not getting harder through the campaign. There's just more and more waves. Remember, I said you can enjoy the first half of Campaign 2? It is because in second half I was surprised to find 120 waves. And I asked myself, what am I spending my life on? Add here, that on any level you are fully build up by half of the waves and then you can go make some coffee, read news or play another game. Just come back from time to time an upgrade something.So, in the end, game is boring, repetative and linear."
