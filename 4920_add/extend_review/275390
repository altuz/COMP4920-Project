Please do not support dishonest business practices and just skip this game altogether. Having to rebuy the game again without even the slightest discount is in no way justifiable.The technical aspects aren't much to look at either, the game either has huge input lag or A LOT of screen tearing, depending on your VSync settings. Pick your poison.This game also still does not support online coop, despite the developer saying in the original game that he wanted to implement it, but did not have the time. Yet they apparently had enough time to re-release the same game with a few added skins and a few more enemies? Right...I'd say vote with your wallet. The developers do not deserve your money."

This game is not only a worthy update but a good starting point for someone who has never played Guacameelee before. I know some people are upset about having to pay for an update but they packed a lot into this. 2 extra levels along with new secrets, intensio mode and my personal favorite a new set of Steam Trading Cards!!The only negative I can say is my hands still haven't recovered from all the abuse I put them through last time to get 100% on the achievements.

,Recommended,275390,11852303,"Posted: 24 August, 2014",all,Soüp,"Since I reviewed Gold Edition previously, I'm going to focus on the differences and new content here.  See my thoughts on why I enjoyed this game so much herehttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/214770Super Turbo Championship Edition is essentially a significant content DLC on top of Gold Edition, but since it makes so many changes to the game it is sold as standalone with a discount for previous owners.  Loading up a Gold Edition savegame simply would not work so if you started the game in Gold Edition you will have to start over in this one.  It adds two new large areas with new gameplay mechanics, adds a bunch of new enemy types (elite versions of existing enemies with new abilities,) some new graphical effects (heat distortion and shadows,) a new rage mechanic for combat, pollo bombs!, and reworks all the fights in the game.  There may be other changes I can't think of at the moment.While none of the new content is strictly necessary to enjoy the game, I found it well worth the $5 upgrade.  The new areas are a lot of fun and quite unique compared to the rest of the game and are integrated seamlessly with the story.  The INTENSO rage mechanic works well as a panic button letting you recover from a fight that's going badly, and that does become necessary.  The fight rework in addition to the new enemies makes the game significantly more difficult which I appreciated but others may not.  In some fights they went a bit too far though, covering the screen with enemies, removing all sense of strategy and turning the combat into a spamfest.So which version should you buy?  I would definitely recommend this one, with the caveat that you may find it too difficult."

It should have all the extra content, bug-fixes, and so on. However, the possibility exists that the newest verson could be inferior in some ways. Game-design is a constant and always finicky, and nobody ever seems to be satisfied with its results. So things get changed, and changed again, sometimes they're even changed back to their original state. It's a constantly confusing nightmare, and for what? In the end it all comes down to preference.Forgive me, I love to ramble.STCE is on paper*, the superior version of Guacamelee! Let's look at some of the facts:Two brand-new areas to explore!A new boss-fight!Intenso!Multiple save-slots!New enemies!Every foe has a visible health-meter!etc!If you're hankering for more Guacamelee, then definitely grab this! The new areas are great. They make the world a bit richer, and are fleshed out with plenty of secrets and fighting/platforming to be had. I also like the little changes such as costumes being unlocked via silver coins. The biggest deal is that the controller-issue I had with Guaca-Gold is fixed, making this by default the superior version for me.BUT!STCE is a different game, and it can be considered inferior in a way. The controversial addition is Intenso! It's the ""shock gloves""** of Guacamelee. Once you fill a meter you can become a superpowered luchadore by pressing L3+R3. Once you purchase all of the upgrades you're practically invincible. Guaca-Gold wasn't a difficult game, so having the ability to cheese the rare moments of challenge makes things a bit too easy. Keep in mind that this ability is optional. Most of the time I forgot I even had it.The new enemies are quaint. For the most part they're reskins that can move faster, hit (much) harder, and will sometimes teleport to get out of danger. Aside from nega-chupacabras doing tons of damage with their sword-stab, they're not a threat. There are also some flying fish in one of the new areas. They remind me of enemies from the Saturn version of Symphony of the Night. They only showed up in one area, and behaved in a similar manner. If it's a reference, then I applaud drinkbox for their attention to obscurity.If you haven't played Guacamelee before, IMO it's best to go straight to this version. It's more convenient, since the original version doesn't have multiple save-slots. Having the most content is a definite plus as well. You might feel the urge to go back to Guaca-Gold for its original ""true"" level of difficulty but eh...I wouldn't recommend it. Most of Guacamelee's challenge is in a couple of boss-fights, and the optional areas like El Infierno. For the most part you're the awesome skull-cracking luchadore on a fun adventure. If you want a difficult Metroidvania, consider Valdis Story: Abyssal City (also on Steam).Mostly though I'm just really happy and relieved that the controller issue I had with Guaca-Gold is fixed in this game. It's the main reason I'll probably never go back to the earlier version (though I have a fair number of achievements I should get).*What is it with ""on paper""? I use that phrase way too often.**The gloves from Batman: Arkham Origins. Punch through any defense, combo count boost, makes things so easy."

All of the stages and characters are beautifully crafted in a slightly demented sort of way, the fighting flows wonderfully, and the upgrade system is easy to use.As for differences between Super Turbo Championship Edition and Gold Edition, there is a new boss, a few new regular enemies, two new stages, a few new music tracks, a new special power, and a heavily revised ""Hard Mode"" - which is many orders of magnitude more diffcult in STCE than it was in the Gold Edition.In all, I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about the game...

You combine regular kicks and special moves into spectacular combos, finishing of enemies with piledrivers, throws and slams. Dodging is easy, so combat in this game is more about fun then frustrating challenge(unless you'll go for OPTIONAL stuff to get achievments).Platforming gets gradualy more difficult and more creative as you learn new moves, but it won't be a problem(unless you'll go for OPTIONAL stuff to get achievments).The world is huge and different, all areas are themed. Exploring it and finding hidden chests with upgrades is fun. Sometimes to get to the chest you'll have to beat platforming puzzles, sometimes combat challenges. There're also some side quest, which are mostly there for comedy reasons. Guys at Drinkbox generaly have a good sense of humor. You'll find a lot of references to your favourite indie and childhood games.The plot is simple, yet characters are different and weird(in a good way). Every big area ends with a boss fight of sort.

Thankfully Super Turbo has fixed most of these problems and the ball-busting stuff is relegated to 100% completion as it should be. Intenso is also a solid enough way to make things somewhat easier while leaving it optional. The levels and boss that they added in Super Turbo are nice additions that are worth 5 bucks if you already own Vanilla. Overall if you haven't bought Guacamelee yet just buy this, its standalone and an improvement over Vanilla. If you want more Guacamelee or felt really burned by Vanilla give Super Turbo a spin, its what I wanted the game to be from the beginning."

Gold Edition, and though I really liked the gameplay mechanics, I wasn't a big fan of the theme at first. I also have a long queue of unplayed games I've been trying to get through, and so I set it down for a while. And then a while became a freaking long time.So I saw GSTCE come out, and thought to myself, hey that game was a lot of fun, here's the perfect excuse to go back. So I picked it up, and this time I couldn't put it down (still haven't as the game is running while I write this). You have a pretty simple set of combat moves (basic atttacks, direction strong/bonus attacks, a set of meters), but some very complex combo abilities emerge. Additionally, the evolving moveset unlocks new areas in the game similar to Super Metroid (can't speak for later ones, never had interest in a first person Metroid).The control scheme feels super tight and rock solid. Often, you play platformers, and the controls will feel sluggish, or delayed. Or the inertia when moving feels 'off'. But not here. The game throws tons of crazy challenges at you (especially inferno levels or tree top), but I always felt like it was my fault I was dieing and not due to the game asking more out of you than its gameplay mechanics allowed for. They push you, but not too far. It feels really well balanced in this respect.There is also something very satisfying about the combo system. From throws, to slams, to just straight up clobbering. Popups, juggles, it's got similarities to a capcom Vs game or maybe even a smash bros. It's one of those games where it's just really fun to turn on and beat the crap out of some things.The game's art style, while seemingly simple and cartoony, is very rich, and contains a deceptive level of detail. The game has save points that you just walk past throughout the world, so you never have to stop the action. Similarly for starting up, menus, and cut scenes. These devs recognize necessary modern conveniences, and they got the biggest of them all right: let the player play the game and don't force them to watch/do crap that they don't want to!If you own the original, this going to come down to what you think $5 is worth for a game. Do you measure it in terms of gameplay hours? Or do you measure it in terms of skilled labor hours put into it by a small indie game company? I chose the latter, picked the game up and have a blast ever since. If you're even a small fan of metroidvanias, I would recommend this game."

,Recommended,275390,21501637,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,Ksempac,"The first thing that surprised me in Guacamelee was obviously the setting. The mexican theme is great. Although i don't know much about mexican culture to know if the game is respectful of it, i appreciate how colorful the game is. Even the ""World of the Dead"" is full of bright colors. Every single environment is just a joy to discover, because it's all so different than most games.The second thing that surprised me was the gameplay. Based on the trailers, I was expecting a pure beat them all, but it's actually a fairly original mix of a beat them all and metroidvania (a platformer with a huge map where you acquire new powers to unlock new parts of the map). The two genres are well implemented, and complements each other very well.On the beat them all side, you've got an array of attacks available, and it's fairly easy to chain them together, which makes it easy to get huge combos. It's always satisfying to reach 50, 100, or even more than 100 hits combo. Every few screens, you will enter an ""arena"", where you need to be able to beat a serie of enemies before the exits are unlocked.On the metroidvania side, you've got lots of platforming, and your beat them all attacks also serves as ways to reach platformers. An uppercut to reach higher ground, a dash to go farther away, etc. As with any metroidvania there is a fair bit of backtracking to do to uncover all secrets, but all secrets are ""fair"": the game give you tons of hints as to where they are, there is no random guessing to do, and the game gives you a completion rate on each map so you know if you've missed something or not.Another aspect where the game is fair and fun, is the platforming. Like any metroidvania, there is a fair bit of jumping around, and combining your powers to reach the hardest parts of a level. However, the great thing about Guacamelee is that if you fail a jump, the game will teleport you right back to the last platform you were on rather than throwing you at the previous checkpoint, which might be quite far away. So even though they are some fairly difficult parts, you're never forced to play huge sections again and again, you just need to retry the last bit that you failed. That's very nice for players, it avoids needless repetitions or raging.However, despite theses mechanisms intended to make the game more accessible, Guacamelee remains a tough game. It's not a hardcore platformer like Super Meat Boy, but it's definitely more difficult than your average platformer. If you like challenging games, you should definitely feels at ease in Guacamelee, which has the added bonus that many of it's more tricky challenges are optional, so it's up to you to decide how much you want to push yourself. 100% completion is totally doable, but will requires some patience.On the same point, it's fairly obvious the game is aimed at long time gamers. Beside the difficulty, it also packs a ton of references to other video games. Billboards in the backgrounds, specific piece of dialogs, characters...there are so many references spread across the game that I'm not sure anyone has ever been able to spot them all.At the other end of the spectrum, people who are not familiar with platformers should stay away from the game. Though the mechanisms are fair, it definitely requires you to be familiar with some platformers tropes, and be used to chain powers together to fling yourself into the air.Moreover, if you want a relaxed experience, where you're just enjoying the story, the game is not for you, because the story is barebones. Though it introduces some interesting characters, the dialogs are basic, and the story is a stereotypical ""knight saves princess"" kind of thing.All of that means that the pleasure of Guacamelee lies in its travel (the screen to screen gameplay) rather than its destination (furthering the story). With its many references, it's an ode to video games and is aimed at long time gamers. It indeniably succeeds at that task. However you should only try if if you're think that would be the sort of things you would enjoy. Otherwise, you're just gonna set yourself up for frustration."

,Recommended,275390,29070939,Posted: 6 January,all,|LZ| lefab,"This little indie game of 2013 is a pearl on it's own.Following the Metroidvania genre, this game is about rescuing a girl while punching skeletons (and some other things) luchador style. In order to progress, you'll learn a bunch of moves that help you navigate the world (a shoryuken to get some height, a ground pound, etc...). Each move can break one type of blocks and while those moves is good for traveling, they works really great for fighting as well.While the game is mostly inspired by the mexican culture (from the design of the characters and background to the music), you'll find tons of references to other video games franchises. For an indie game, this is some of the smoothest animation I've seen of a 2D game, no movement feel clunky or out of place. Sadly, the different area are a little too cliche and don't expect a deep story, it's about the same level as a Mario game.The game is filled with collectibles and optional challenges. The difficulty is well balanced (while the beginning seem quite easy, some enemies become tricky to fight and the platforming tight. If it's still too easy for you, you unlock hard mode once you beat the game (basically, enemies has double hp and inflict double damage). The game isn't that long but if you try to 100% it, it'll take some time (it took me ~10h to get all but one achievement : beating the game in hard mode)You can play local coop in this game to make thing more crazy. There is even a workshop to download custom skins, without altering the gameplay. The sad thing is that the community isn't very active and there isn't that many skins to download (97 for the gold edition, 52 for this one).Speaking of editions, on PC you can chose between 2 editions : The gold edition and the Super Turbo Championship edition.The gold edition is the base game, a port of the original from PS3/Vita.The STC edition is a tweaked base game with tons of stuff added (new abilities, enemies, areas, etc ...)Since the price of the STC is just 1€ more than the gold edition, there is no real point to get the gold edition (unless you REALLY want those extra custom skins)Overall, a really solid game, not that ambitious but with very few flaws. I still would recommand to wait 'till it's on sale though (it dropped below 5€ this last winter sale)."
,Recommended,275390,28041561,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,Skeletal Knave,"I must admit, I wanted it out of curiosity in the beginning, but I couldn't expect how much fun it could actually be.The fighting system feels fast, responsive, and with a lot of potential for combos, and juggling enemies in the air. Each move you have has a specific purpose and is clearly differentiated from the others, creating a small yet varied set of tools at your disposal. Yet one can't help but think that a couple more moves wpuld help make battles more varied and interesting. The tactical side of things, later on with the addition of shielded and alternate dimension enemies you can't just  take them all on at once, you have to be more methodical, to decide which targets are a priority, which should be knocked down for later.The game can be pretty tactical, yet not so much so as to become slow or unenjoyable. The game doesn't ask you to make big plans about each fight, but to assess the situation and make on-the-fly choices to defeat you enemies in the most efficient, safe, fashion. And that makes it actually rather enjoyable.Unfortunately, however, the difficulty from battles comes more from the ammount of enemies rather than the individual enemies themselves. They never really feel dangerous on their own right, all of them being rather slow and having pretty big tells for when they're going to attack, making it easy to avoid them. Instead, the danger comes from having to keep track of a lot of enemies at once. Yet, at the same time, it makes sense, since it helps keep the flow of the game, whereas single, difficult enemies might make it slower. Overall, the combat is good and has quite a lot of potentialThe art style is indeed pleasing to the eye, it looks really colourful yet clean and simple. It's nice to look at and adds character to the game, it works with it, whereas a more realistic approach, at least in my opinion wouldn't have been half as charmingHowever, one thing the game does suffer from, is it's really short length. I finished the campaign in about ten hours, and I really took my time and 100%'d it. And while it's true that it's better to not overstay your welcome and instead leave a good memory, I'd say Guacamelee!, however, left too early, leaving you wanting more but without much else to do, as the game doesn't really have much in the way of post-game content, other than the El Infierno and Caverna del Pollo challenges. Granted the game does have a good ammount of exploration to do to get all the secrets, it rather goes by fastAnother small problem the game has, is it's lack of online co-op capabilities. While it's understanable that it could cause a lot of problems and frustration with an uncoodinated group, it would also be great fun when it worked. It would be a really nice feature to have when your friends aren't available for some Luchador action.As I have rambled a lot, and with purpose of making the list more approachable, I'll include a list of pros and cons:Pros:+Very solid and entertaining fighting style that doesn't get old+Well differentiated moveset where every move has its clear purpose+Lots of enemies that make for varied encounters and strategies to beat them+Colourful and clean artstyle that adds charm to the game and has just enough ammount of detail to not feel boring+The enemies, thanks to the art style are inmediately recognizable, and thus you are rarely confused about what you should do+A good amount of costumes, with their own effects, that allow even more variety in your battles, and in my opinion, look pretty nice+ChickensCons:-The game suffers from a really short length, leaving you wanting more with no real way to ease that craving-Not much in the way of post-game content. It's a small game-The movelist, although differentiated, is rather small. It could have done with some more moves-The platforming requires good eye-hand coordination late-game. Can become frustrating if you have poor reflexes-A little too heavy on the memes-No online multiplayer supportThe game, overall, is really good and I enjoyed it inmensely. I'm also impressed in how well the extra areas are included in the game, I didn't know they were add-ons until I looked them up due to how well integrated they are. The only real complain I have about the game is the short lenght. It's a small game, but a really good one. I would definitely recommend it"

This is NOT a cash grab with a couple of levels tacked on, it's a complete overhaul. The new levels are fully integrated into the base game. Certain pathways that were accessible in the original are blocked off in this game, and require the use of new abilities needed to traverse parts of the new levels.The new abilities are available early on, and required a complete rebalancing  of all prior enemies. The new enemies, traps, and levels, are much more challenging. The difficulty ramps up steadily to the point of frustration, but that makes it all the sweeter when you finally manage to get past a difficult section.If you enjoyed the Gold Edition, you'll enjoy this one even more."

However, while it is all shiny and new, that doesn't mean this version is just a straight upgrade. For the most part, the new content is great. I love the new mini-towns, the music, the 2 massive new levels, and the visual updates, but that doesn't mean that every new addition was perfectly executed. My main problem with the game is the Intenso mechanic. It seems really cool at first, but it REALLY hindered the combat for me. One of my favorite parts of Guacamelee was how challenging and tight the combat was, but the Intenso meter ruins that whole feeling. Instead of being a really fluid and tense action/platformer, the Intenso meter just turns the whole thing into a spam fest. This is especially evident in the new arenas. While I like the new arena layout designs, Drinkbox just decided to flood them with enemies to create the illusion of difficulty, but because of how easy it is to use the Intenso, these arenas become a breeze, with no real satisfaction attacted to them. Overall I would still recommend this game, but it's hard for me to say whether you should pick Guacamelee Gold up instead. I think they are both great, but STCE didn't feel as challenging or rewarding to me at all."

It has a very good storyline that likes to bring in ideas from other games while having its own personal humor. The only issue I have with the game is that its so fricken hard. The problem is its hard for hards sake not that its overly challanging. The hardness comes from platforming thats extremely complicated and fights that are the same kind of fight over and over again. Plus you can't get the ""good"" ending unless you do a huge mess of extremely hard challanges. The diffaculty of the game is what really dampens the game in my opinion. It isn't super meat boy hard but it's still really tough. Still, it was a fun game and I reccomend it for all for a few bucks.

Guac has personality to spare, engaging and true metroidvania gameplay, and never really outstays its welcome. If you are at all interested in the artstyle that alone is enough to play as nothing here would be so irritating to put you off a quick a jaunt through the game. It is worth it to see this in 4K. Its mechanics are all sound as well to my liking.The writing can grate at times. It's nothing too edgy or weird, but it's so-so for my tastes. About the only negative I have to say about it, and it's still pretty good overall. The traditional upgrades and RPG elements round out an impressive package that was heavily upgraded itself from the Gold edition released before it.

Bought this game on a steam sale years ago and just finally got bored enough to play it and with my little expectations I was BLOWN AWAY.Everything from the art style, to the humor, to the gameplay, even the narrative left a very postive taste in my mouth. It's like a 2d version of my favorite game of all time ocarina of time. You go to a new place get a new power to help you solve incresingly diffacult puzzles just like a zelda, but this game adds in interesting challenges by adding moderately difficult platforming while fighting against hordes of baddies.The action is everywhere, if I had to nitpick i'd say there are too many enemies, but a large portion of the enemies are optional battles. That being said combat is very fun. Its easy to string hits but you can do some pretty narly combos. And I love how baddies scale in this game, instead of taking a billion hits to kill late game they just start to dodge and become pseudo boss attack patterns.And each area concludes with a boss battle. The inner sadist in me wishes they were harder, but they are epic feeling. Every boss is unique, has a progression to how they attack, and once you figure out their patterns are very rewarding to kill.The narrative is pretty moving. The plot is pretty straightfoward but the combination of the art style and the unique setting of the game really helps disguise the fact that it is basically dude rescues the princess platformer. The characters are memorable, the dialog is good and the cutscenes are powerful.The comedy style of this game is gold for me I could see it being a detterant for someone who wants their game to be taken seriously, but its an indie game. At one point the devs run out of new ability names so they litterally say sorry we ran out of names and give you a move called ""Dashing Derpderp"".I just beat the game on regular mode, but in order to get the complete narrative I have to go back and play on a new game plus type deal and I'm ECSTATIC.

I purchased it immediately and just finished my Normal playthrough.Guacamelee!: Super Turbo Championship Edition adds a good amount of extra content, in the form of new levels, new enemies scattered throughout the game, a new boss, and new abilities. It's a ""Metroidvania"" style 2D action game, but instead of a bounty hunter or vampire hunter, you play as Guacamelee!, a luchador fighting his way through both the land of the living and the dead to rescue his love.The Good:*Unique art style drawing from Mexican folklore, specifically the ""Day of the Dead""*Great music and environments*Tight controls*Clever, rarely frustrating platforming sections*Fun combat, with a mix of combo-based striking and grappling*Simple story with humor and references to classic games all over every stage of the gameThe Bad:*Can't remap controls on a controller. This is a minor gripe, because the controls make sense, except for the new ""Intenso"" mode, which requires pressing LS and RS simultaneously on a gamepad. This is annoying, especially considering that RB and RT are both mapped to the same function, and either could have been switched to Intenso mode.*Game is short. I wanted it to last longer. There is replayability in a Hard mode unlock and a challenge guantlet of sorts, with lots of hidden items to go back and find for 100% completion. But even with the added content, I beat the game in 9 hours (not 100%), with a considerable amount of backtracking and exploration.*The new Intenso mode makes combat far too easy on Normal playthrough. Entering Intenso mode lets you just wail on anything until it runs out, forgoing combos and dodging entirely.Overall, I'd highly recommend this game. As an owner of the original Guacamelee!, I received the upgrade at a discount (67% off, or $5). I had no issues replaying the game from scratch, because it's fun. I'd be less likely to recommend the upgrade to existing Guacamelee! owners at $15, because there's not THAT much new content. For new owners, however, $15 is absolutely worth it, even with the short length of the game. You'll want to get 100% completion, and then tackle Hard mode if you still haven't had enough."

It took us about 7 hours to beat even with the two of us. You pretty much play as a super-hero luchador in a beat-em-up style game trying to save your princess. There is tons of secrets, in which you don't unlock the 'true ending' unless you find them all. You can also unlock different costumes which gives you different benefits and you can upgrade your skills. I played most of the game with the Diablo suit which kind of made it like hard mode even on easy.I gotta say this game really did remind me of the old-school games and some of the music even sounded alot like Mario and other games. Enemies were decently hard to beat without being too difficult, but keep in mind I did have another player helping me. Storyline is decent and there is tons of humor in the game also. It's kinda like they took everything people love about indie games and put it into this game.Co-op design is fairly decent but the camera kinda sucks as it will only follow player one instead of expanding. Every time you die you have a timer to wait to come back and when you do you're a little orb that floats around until your teammate releases you. I felt this made the co-op fair without being too much struggle. Pretty much a fun co-op experience that adds mild difficulty to great teamwork gameplay. Coordinating certain platforming can be incredibly hectic though and we usually just let one person do all the platforming at the hard parts because it was too hard with two people to do.Co-op is also somewhat buggy... I have a screenshot where instead of dying, me and my buddy just have 3 copies of ourselves each...I will probably replay the hell out of this game until I unlock all of the achievements. I can't really say too much bad about the game in all honestly so I would have to give the game somewhere around a 4.5/5."

Juan, um homem simples do campo, vai ao encontro da filha do presidente, que é sua amiga de infância, para que juntos fossem às festividades deste feriado.

A really nice platformer/brawler with interesting mechanics, such as turning into a chicken, switching between the dead and living world and combining different moves to get from a to b or to defeat certain enemies. Certainly nothing revolutionary and the story is ... well ...sometimes it has its funny moments. The luchador and ""day of the dead"" theme in general is pretty cool though. Would pick it up for about 10 bucks. Should keep you occupied for about 8 hours I guess. The amount of backtracking is definitely ok, since you will be revisiting many areas as the story progresses so I never had to ""go out of my way"" to get to new areas. You can also view all maps on the map screen and blocked areas are easy to spot as well as to how to get past them (dimension shift, pollo power or red, blue, green, yellow blocks). Combat is extremely responsive. All in all a solid 8/10 if you need a scale."

,Not Recommended,275390,34804332,Posted: 7 September,all,Palmturtle347,"ProsBeautiful graphics, good soundtrack, and variety. The way the game uses abilities you learn in different ways over time for platforming segments really amazes me. The way a side dash could be used to break a specific block but then you must immediately switch dimensions to avoid a hazard and then take out the enemies is really fun to do. Giving you 3 different base combat approaches, 4 special abilities that get throughout the game (""that uses an ability meter""), a grapple move with different add-ons, and 2 special movement abilities. That does not even include the other forms and their abilities. As you can see, there is a lot of variety in this game.ConsThe more does not always mean the merrier, as a seasoned guacamelee player, you understand the moves how to use them, and the game can be pretty fun. But to a friend or sibling you are bringing in later to play, they become confused and overwhelmed with the amount of things you can do. The dimension swapping is used beautifully in platfroming segments, but not as well in combat. Some enemies cannot be attacked in one dimension, so you have to switch. That is good design, but the enemies can always attack you, regardless of dimension. Later in game, when they pile on multiple enemies from multiple dimensions, instead of getting challenging, it gets frustrating. This caused me to loathe any combat segment later in game. Also most bosses are very ""cheap"", with too much health and a very small window to attack them. But I've always felt that was the problem for most metroidvania bosses. When they are to weak, you breeze through and completely forget them. When they are too HARD (Final Boss), then it isn't fun. You are no longer a fighter against a very powerful foe, and you must learn their technique to win. You are waiting for them to attack, dodging, attack, waiting, dodging, attacking, losing, repeat, repeat, REPEAT. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't happen that often, but later in game, bosses become harder, and more of them.Best Parts of the game:Abilities (you must learn them)EnemiesPlatforming segmentsGraphics styleMusicCharactersStoryThe Arena sectionWorst Parts of game:Bosses (most)Enemies (Later in Game)Difficult learning curve (if you come in later)With so little Cons, you'd think I love the Game, and I do, but those few nagging details were so prevalent, especially in the last third of the game, that I can't recommend this game. I do love it, and I'm glad I bought it, but it  left me with such a sour taste that I cannot recommend it. If you can deal with those issues. Then buy it."

It's not. The title's just there to sell the game's aesthetic. And you'd think that a game like this that goes so far out of its way to give life to its little cartoon Latin America would try and capitalize on what Latin American culture has to offer in terms of themes storytelling, sort of like what 2015's Book of Life ended up doing, or like what Clover did with Okami and Japanese folklore.But wow. Not Guacamelee miss its chance to do that, it dives off a cliff to avoid it.Gorgeous animation, beautifully thematic visual design are all wasted here in a game who's core is bogged down by an overwhelming amount of lame, blatant references to other video games have nothing to do with this one (I still can't wrap my head around the Hotline Miami billboard) and 2013 era memes that not only cringy and extremely dated, but break the immersion the art and music worked so hard to encourage. And if you want to give the game props for being mechanically functional and satisfying, that's fine, but there are better games that are better at even just being metroidvanias than Guacamelee is.Pair that with writing that's clichéd but alright at best when it’s not busy explaining its jokes and winking to the audience and you’re left with just a hollow, cynical shell of a game that thinks pleasing a crowd is the same thing as being good. It thinks that a cultural aesthetic can be worn and sold like a costume. It's gross, it's cringy, but it's worst of all just plain lazy. And that's a damn shame.Don't buy this game."

However, good gameplay can only go so far and the rest of Guacamelee's element fall short.The thing about Guacamelee is that it has a good premise. It looks really fun, colorful and wacky and all these qualities hints that you are about to enter a wonderful and original world full of spectacles. But it is sadly not the case and you start realizing it when you notice that there is barely no interesting NPC hanging in the couple of towns there is and all the temple look like one another making hard to remenber your adventure in Guacamelee. Even the music is pretty bland and forgettable. Then come the bosses. They all have cool design and are indeed interesting by themselves, but they still end out as flat and boring. They try as hard as they can to have emotion and something interesting to say, but all that effort is wasted when Juan (the protagonist) just stand there, emotionless, waiting for them to shut up so he can move on.It was a mistake to take the silent protagonist route with Juan and if, they had to do it, they should have done it the same way Zelda does by having the hero emote and having a lot of interesting NPC filling the void that Link leave.Overall, I still had fun with this title and the ending sequence is the only part where I can say, weirdly enough, none of these issues I mention are present and I really felt satisfied at the end. But still, I though there were going to be more charm and personality in this game."

The look of your world is so great, and your humor and music just wonderful.The first few hours of the game is also pretty fun. But then somewhere along the way it seems the developers got too full of themselves, and resorted to cheap and frustrating gameplay mechanics. Spikes, time pressure, crazy difficuly jumps you have to make it through, fights made more difficult by just increasing the amount of enemies, insanely frustrating and unskippable boss battles. There is so much bad game design here, and whoever designed some of these jumping puzzles should never be allowed to design games again.After giving up the first time I knew it was naive of me to hope for anything better in this version, but I got the impression it was made more balanced and forgiving. It appears that very little has changed at all. Even the addition of the ""Intenso"" mode does little to improve the gameplay. What they *should* have done was make an Easy mode for those of us who want to enjoy the story and platforming without obsessing over stupid combos and trick jumps for hours on end, and give the option to skip the bloody boss fights.SO, got that out of my system."

Gold Edition a little less than a year ago, and it still hold true to this version of the game.I do like the additions that they added (a couple of moves for your chicken form, two extra zones and an extra boss and the El Intenso ability).  Even though they feel a little where they just threw them in, it is probably because since I played the Gold Edition, that is probably why.  I feel that if someone were to only play this version of Guacamelee! for the first time, it would feel natual.  I feel that we could of done without the El Intenso ability.  It felt like a ability that gave me a free pass through areas I just didn't want to deal with.The change they did to make it easier to get the other outfits was very welcome.  With the Gold Edition, I didn't get any of them because you had to get them late game and by that time, you had pretty much beaten the game, so you didn't really have to use them.  This way, you can not get them earlier in the game and they help with your play style.  I found myself using them more due to it and I really liked that.As I said in my Gold Edition review of Guacamelee!, if you are a fan of Metroidvania style games, this one doesn't disappoint, one of the few games that I beat and want to go back to try and get all the items/achievements even though it can be tough."

He goes on an adventure to save his childhood love, the El Presidente's Daughter, from the evil Carlos Calaca. Yea it a strange story, but hey what are video games for if you can't have a strange story from time to time. The story is really entertaining and the game is constantly making references to other games. It help set up a fun atmosphere.The game play like your standard 2D platformer, but what set it apart levels have 2 designs, a living and dead. Playing as Juan you'll find yourself having to switch between the land of the living and dead to get through areas and find their secrets. You'll also have to use you're wrestling abilities as you learn them to help you progress through the game.The combat involve punching your enemies enough to get them vunerable enough to throw them into other enemies or into environmental hazard. As you learn new abilities, enemies will start to spawn with barriers that can only be broken by using that ability. As you go through the game, you will encounter newer enemies that will put your new powers to the test.Honestly this is a fun game that knows how silly it is and it take pleasure in it.

STCE is the definitive edition of the Guacamelee game, If you're a new player, you should buy this edition.But should you buy this game?I like the game's colourful existence with its stunning 2D graphics and detailed art.Its combat system, while limited in moves, has real depth in how you utilise the moves to create combos. Punching an enemy till it's grappeable, throwing it up in the air, uppercutting it again, and then jumping  above it to belly splash is fun to do , never gets old and you get rewarded for it.This is a game that loves its combat but there's another thing that it loves. Platforming.See, this particular Metroid/Castlevania hybrid just loves platforming. Whilst the two games mentioned in the previous sentence aren't too too heavy on platforming, Guacamelee revels in mixing platforming in a 2D space and combat. While you rarely have to platform and fight at the same time, you will be doing a lot of both throughout this 10-12 hr game. I'm not the biggest platforming fan, myself and if you're not a platforming fan, be wary that this game as a lot and some of it is quite tough. The game is lenient in the main path , giving you plenty of checkpoints but sometimes the platforming gets a bit much.However, the worst part of the game is the music. It's awful. Made with a Latin American style (lots of Mexican type instruments which escape the mind), most tracks are dull, repititive and just boring.There isn't even a boss theme for the myriad of bosses you fight! I recommend putting on your own tunes or podcasts when playing the game, The meme humour in the game also gets a bit much as well. Memes usually are outdated in minutes and while there are numerous nods to many different franchises and games, it might elicit a groan every now and then,In the end, decide if you want a 2D action/exploration game with a focus on combat and platforming. It's an OK ride but be wary of the music. It's terrible."

Gold edition was fantastic and even if you have beaten it I still would reccomend super turbo championship edition. It just tightens everything up; expands the story, allows for 4-person local co-op, adds egg bombs... it's just so much fun to play, especially with friends. This game has actual skill requirements for its platforming puzzles and that is where the only flaw I can imagine for this game comes from (though completely avoidable in this version with moderate skill): co-operative platforming often results in getting in eachother's way.In gold edition everybody was locked to the same phase as eachother meaning that platform puzzles that involved phase swaps got complicated, nigh impossible, fast. IN this one everybody can control their phase independantly, which makes it completely plausible, just confusing. When we played through we usually dropped to one player for difficult puzzles to keep camera in the best location.Overall I loved this game, my absolute favourite platformer thus far."

I put it right next to Cave Story in my list of favorite indie games.Guacamelee is a Metroidvania 2D-sidescrolling action game. Here are my personal highlights:-Pacing and level design are both fantastic. The game introduces new powerups and abilities at a constant steady pace, which keeps the game feeling fresh the whole way through. Every powerup you unlock opens up new areas in past locations you've already visited, with new goodies to discover in each.-Combat is fun and easy enough to understand. It's pure melee action and rewards you for chaining combos of different moves. It gives you full freedom to pull off different combos of all sorts.-Art style is stylish, gorgeous, and makes good use of Mesoamerican cultural references/imagery in a respectful manner.-The soundtrack fits all of the different (Mexican) environments perfectly. I don't think the developers (in Canada) had a single person of Mexican descent on their team when they made this game... but I can tell they did their homework on Mexican culture.-Lots of clever easter eggs and references to other games like Metroid, Mario, Zelda, and other indie games. It was fun spotting them all.I didn't really find anything to fault the game for, other than that it never recognized my USB gamepad, so I had to play it with my keyboard. It was still enjoyable despite that though. If you have a Xbox 360 controller (I don't, mine's a generic USB pad) you likely won't have this problem.I definitely recommend this game! It deserves every bit of praise it gets. I sadly never got to try out the 2-4 player co-op multiplayer, but I imagine that would only have made it even more enjoyable."

The game is a triumph and I will recommend it to anybody. But that's not what this review is about. This review is about which version to buy.There is much hoo-hah in the reviews here pertaining to the inclusion of Intenso mode, and the concurrent rebalancing of difficulty. I've beaten the original game twice - once on normal, and another time on hard - and I honestly didn't notice much of a difference. There are a few more enemies in some sections, but nothing that gave me any serious grief. If you're skilled you won't even need to use Intenso mode, but some people struggled with the difficulty of the original game, so I don't begrudge its inclusion. Think of it as an alterable in-game difficulty setting and if you don't like using easy mode, well then you won't need to use Intenso.The purported remixing of existing levels is also very slight - basically a few new chests have been added and some old ones relocated. It's a non-event.Perhaps most worthless is the new power-up, the Pollo Bomb. Once you've obtained it, pressing B while in the form of a chicken will make you lay an egg that explodes after a second or so, delivering a ridiculously small amount of damage to nearby enemies. There is literally no situation in which a pollo bomb would be preferable to straight-up melee. It only really serves to break a few new types of barrier rocks, which typically lead to some of the 'remixed' sections.If you're not going to be using the 4-player co-op, which I haven't tested, this really only leaves the two new areas as an incentive to buy the game. And they're good - nothing has been half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they don't feel like they've been shoe-horned in. They fit in seamlessly on narrative, geographic and aesthetic levels. They offer an extra hour or two of fun gameplay. But that's all they offer.So ultimately, if you don't own any version of Guacamelee at all, buying this one is a no-brainer - it has the most content, and is the must customisable to your ability as a gamer. However, if you already own Gold, you need to ask yourself how much 2 hours of gameplay is worth to you, because that's the only thing of substance STCE offers over Gold. To market it as a completely separate game really does seem like a cash-grab, as I see no reason this couldn't have been sold as relatively inexpensive DLC."

The combat is engaging and satisfying, because it ramps up at a moderate pace, and the sound design and art give weight to each attack. The environments and enemies are different enough that the game doesn't become stale, especially if you're not a completionist. For those who are completionists, even though some of the backtracking can be tedious, the challenges are reasonable but not too easy, so they present a roadblock that will be fun to overcome.   Also for completionists, the map gives you % complete for each area, so you won't be frustrated that you're at 98% and don't know where to find that last item you missed.The pace, sound, and art are all things that drew me in, and kept me playing with Guacamelee.

,Recommended,275390,19966959,"Posted: 26 December, 2015",all,Decapitator,"*I'm evolving this review over timeWhile the game has a few more minor things that could use improving, the overall construction of the game is well though out and well executed.+ The music complements the theme and pace of the gameplay nicely and has a enough variety for the size of the game. It's also good, well composed music to boot+ Solid animations and sounds that make you feel every hit you give/take+ Great visuals. Has real attention to detail with the Mexican art style and borrows a little from GRim Fandango, while remaining its own style+ Level design is excellent and Guacamelee STCE should be used as a showcase for great level design to anyone aspiring to build platformers. Each new mechanic is introduced to the player beautifully, then combined with other previously learned mechanics, which provides a progressively tougher environment to fight through. There is also an almost perfect mix of player versus environment and player versus AI and this also gets more challenging at a good pace throughout the game+ Fast paced combat+ Funny+ Seeds other game art and pop culture art into the game with it's own style e.g.Manny Calavera skulls can be found on posters throughout the game+ Cool game mechanics with things likeINTENSO (my favourite thing in the game and what an awesome name for it too!), Dimensional Shifting, Playing as a Chicken, etc.+ Moddable+Has the land of the dead!+ RPG mechanic is well executed+ LOTS of save points that are very well spaced out- Mini map needs level detail, not just room shape- No quest log for side quests or clues on where to go to finish these- Enemies can interrupt special moves- Knockback is more frustrating than it needs to be. You get knocked back too far and it takes too long to recover, which really breaks game flow- If you die, you have to re-open all treasure chests you opened before dying after last savepoint. This is a minor one, but I feel it breaks game flow a bit- There need to be more teleportation spots in the game. When revisiting areas to get the extras with new skills, not being able to teleport to the next area without having to traverse a huge amount of ground, becomes very tedious- Controls while feeling fairly solid, could be better- The stick controls could handle player intention a bit better e.g. if player is pushing the left stick predominantly up but not perfectly, then the game should still take it as up, not sideways- If you fight a boss and die, when you respawn your intenso meter doesn't return to the fullness level it had before the fight- Throws often don't go where the arrow is pointing- Pushing off a wall for Goat Fly often ends up with Juan just dropping off the wall- Platform clipping is unforgiving and it gets annoying fast when you're jumping around on floating platforms- Double jump doesnt work if you jump from holding onto a wall- The throwing mechanic is broken. Objects will often not be thrown in the direction of the arrow and this is infinitely frustrating during sequences in the game where this is necessary to move on to the next bit- Intenso meter doesn't return to original state of fullness when you respawn if you die in a boss battle+- I'm in 2 minds about the wall jumping mechanic in the game. It's one of the biggest, if not the biggest mechanic in the game and the levels are clearly designed to take full advantage of it works with jumping from wall to wall and not being able to jump up the same wall in consecutive jumps. While this presents the player with a challenging mechanic, it's also very frustrating to use while traversing areas because it leaves no room for recovery from slight mistakes. This is really evident in the beginning of the game before Juan gets his dash skills.Personally, I would have made the early design decision to go with a consecutive wall jump up the same wall and used a limiter like jump stamina. This way, most of the challenges would still work and the level design wouldn't need to be any more involved for developers to prevent player out of bounds issues."

Lime-green shields and yellow shields do not mix with protanopia, unfortunately. I've died multiple times because of that fact.Update to review:Having played now to the final area, I've been a bit dissappointed and am knocking some from the score. The endgame, for some reason, shifted gears from super fun combo-happy throw-your-enemies-around-the-screen combat to arbitrarily difficult twitch reflexes and unfair fights. You're required to repeatedly shift dimensions perfectly in time, and one horrific fight required you to cling around on walls and hit enemies in mid-air (using a skill I won't reveal) perfectly or else you fall to your death instantly. When I reached the final dungeon itself (this twitch section was the approach), I discovered hordes of the same enemies I'd been fighting the whole game. The only difference was that this area merely replicated the enemies over and over and over, forcing me to fight ten or fifteen of them at the same time. This may sound like normal game design, but keep in mind that half of the enemies are in one dimension and half in the other, meaning that you can't even damage half of them and they're able just to repeatedly hit at you while you try to deal with the other half. If one enemy gets a hit off on you, you're locked in hitstun for quite a while (every hit in Guacamelee results in Juan being launched off his feet) and only pure luck dictates whether another enemy will hit you before you prepare a dodge. In addition, many of these enemies have green or yellow shields. Again, I have protanopia. When I use trial-and-error to hit at a shield and it's the wrong color, allowing the enemy to hit me back and locking me in hitstun, finally killing me and forcing me to begin the entire battle again because I HAVE A STUPID EYE MUTATION BY NONE OF MY OWN CHOICE, that's frustrating. There are no words to describe how frustrating that is. Imagine strolling along on your favourite nature walk, only to find that someone's set a fire and burned down the scenery only to annoy you. That's how frustrating it is. It's so frustrating, in fact, that this update to review is being written after a ragequit. I rarely, rarely, rarely ragequit.The endgame is bad. It trades the fun combat of the early game for arbitrarily difficult combat against hordes of enemies. The hordes of enemies don't have a trick to them. There isn't any make-the-floor-disappear-so-they-fall-in-the-lava element to them. It's just you versus an unfair set of skeletons with ambiguously-colored shields. Horrible. Now I'm going to have frustrating nightmares and ragequit my night's sleep.9/108/10 for a Metroidvania."

The story is about saving a damsel and the world. Everything else...Great sound, visuals, mechanics and level design, with a fresh brand of humor added in. The game is always conveying a feeling of liveliness and the grappling mechanics make the fights interesting. My only (minor) gripes are that the 'Intenso' feels like a cheat, rather than something that the game was designed with in mind, and the side questing and chicken-mode felt underdeveloped.The gameplay mixes metroidvania-esque exploration with beat'em up combat, with a focus on moves that not only deal damage, but also improve mobility when platforming.The pacing is good and ends at just the right time imo. I've spent about 18hrs exploring 100% of most areas. The game helpfully shows you on the world map which areas you've fully explored by gilding them; there are 15 areas in total.Difficulty-wise, it's not hard at all, unless you decide to explore off the beaten path for extra challenges.

The biggest highlight is the combat system. It may feel unintuitive at first, but after some time and additional moves unlocked, you will be dishing out ""CARNAGE!"" to hordes of unique enemies.

Also there are (olmecs??) to help with the travel so you dont have to run for a hour to get somewhere.I also enjoyed the RPG elements of the game. being able to upgrade though the money system was a nice perk. the costumes were also a nice touch and came in handy for the inferno rooms to help with different trouble spotsthe difficulty ramped up nice and steady. I never felt like it curved up to sharp. The inferno rooms are the hardest part of the entire game so if you are looking for a challenge in this game that is were you should go. It reminded me allot of the VR rooms in bionic commando rearmed.music, sound and art style are great. I enjoyed the visuals allot and the music was a nice mix of authintic with some electronic elements added to it. A good comparison might be donkey kong country returns. while not the same it has the same illustrated feel.gameplay was tight however i did have some quirks that i had trouble with. when playing the combo chicken arena i often had issues with the controls pushing juan the oppositie direction of what i pushed. in other wards doing a uppercut to the left instead of the right. breaking the combo fow. outside of this though it wasnt to much of a problem with the rest of the game. I also liked how things were mapped to the controller. in fact the feel there was more like the metroid prime series (visors) then say super metroid.as for the beat em up style this game uses. i normally get tired of these type of games. (think heavenly sword, or final fight maybe) but this game switched things up so much i really did not get tired of it tell around the 60 hour mark which was fine as i was playing back through it on hard mode by that time.speaking of hard mode. It really is hard mode. If you just want to rush through the game and beat calaca hard mode isnt that much harder. you loose more health, there are more enemies, and the bosses have some extra patterns. Now if you want to 100% hard mode, that is difficult. especially the inferno rooms. my advice is try to 100% as much as you can before going to inferno.In the end i love this game and is one of the games i platinumed this year. I dig the style, the cheesy and funny lines from the NPC were entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the metroidvania style of games as this is one of the best ones."

Some of the platform puzzles can be tricky but rewarding once they're figured out and fun to solve with the arsenal of cool abilities and combos (a controller is pretty much imperative).

At a certain point, you will feel like an OP beefcake.The game does quite a bit of handholding, however, with so many checkpoints and conventient respawn locations.  Sometimes it feels like there is very little at stake, and so Guacamelee! might seem a little too casual for more hardcore gamers.  There are, on the other hand, enough in-game and Steam achievements to warrant multiple playthroughs and serious skill-honing."

For those of you familiar with Super Metroid on the SNES, this is pretty much like a love letter to the game.  The influence of that game on this one can be seen all the way from the abilities you earn from statues to the similarities in some of the platforming mechanics in how you use those abilities.  The only issue with the game is that it is fairly short.  However, the replay value is quite high as the fighting mechanics are simple to learn, but provide a high degree of complexity, making the game so much fun.If you're a fan of Super Metroid, I wouldn't even think twice about purchasing this game.

The moves are integrated seamlessly for both combat and platforming, especially the red and blue moves. And it's actually a good thing that it gets easier to get upgrades as you gain abilities even though they were accessible with an earlier ability. You'll be thankful, as this game goes from somewhat easy but not too easy early on to downright brutal in the later levels, though thankfully not too much harder between any two succeeding levels. Sadly, I lack the raw skill to take down what seems to be the final boss's true form, though it's still apparent, as it was when I struggled on earlier bosses and level segments, that it really is my own skill keeping me from winning, and it was my own skill that carried me to victory up until now.The plot and villains are nothing to write home about, but they're still lovable and entertaining and, importantly, carry the excellent gameplay.The Mexican style is a nice touch, though sadly the style of music is not to my liking (and the boss music especially doesn't sound much like boss music), but I'm being more fair to this game because of that.So, overall, if you want either a beat 'em up or a metroidvania and can tolerate the other, especially if you'd appreciate both together, this game is for you!"

However, I suppose that ‘Super Turbo Championship Edition’ as a tad easier due to adding the Super Meter and perhaps just getting better with time. There is still the insane challenge secrets if you’re looking for some tough stuff to get mad at.Dislikes:The, well, Special Moves with the B button usually have a lot of lag on them making some platforming delayed and janky. I get that for combos it’s supposed to feel good when you cancel into them butI love references to other games within games but, especially in the town area, it’s a bit much. Keep the references as easter-eggs or subtle things. Don’t just make the power-ups statues straight up Chozo.Backtracking feels sluggish, there is a sort of dash but requires a wall and a straight shot. There’s a lot of open and straight planes that take a while to traverse with you want to check a lego block that you haven’t smashed yet.Disclaimer:[Game playable with four friends. Will make you feel lonely if finished by yourself.]Basically:Take it or leave it, it’s not a bad game. Buy it if you like Metroidvanias, have friends around and have some extra cash to spend. Don’t go for 100% unless you have ballz of steel.Note to self: Lol, review for Gold Edition was very salty. My B."

Steam sales. All I can say is that it is alright. Not something I'll come back to, as there are way too many fighting games out there. They're all waiting to be mastered. I can't get myself to play this again for fun!Sans has stole the president's daughter and now it is up to you, Zangief, to save the daughter for mutha russia. Yeah, I don't pay attension to stories of video games. I mean, if I did, then Street Fighter would I confused me so much...Anyway, this is a fun beat'em up with lots of platforming and combat. The combat is satisfing and there is plenty of enemy varity. The enemies are never unfair, just challenging and tough in numbers.Combos are REALLY satisfing in this game. They are performed by using all of your unique attacks in anyway you want. This game feels like playing 3.0 PM Mewtwo or Melee Fox in turbo mode. YOU'RE UNSTOPPABLE! Want to cancel shoryuken into headbutt? Feel free to. The best part is you can upgrade your abilities to wombo combo your enemies even more. You can upgrade your stamina bar to cancel into more special moves in a combo. Want to add a belly flop into that uppercut head combo? BOOM! You can now once you get the upgrades. It is easy and VERY satisfing to come up with a long combo yourself out of moves that you didn't even consider that useful in a fight. It is so tasty to try all your combos against unique opponents who require different methods of comboing.Heck, battles don't feel like they come often! Your mostly platforming, fighting bosses, and reading or seeing a bunch of video game/culture references. Bust it Bill: The black, angry Ralph. A wood sign that resembles Cactuar. Using an axe to cut down a bridge that a monster tries to cross to kill you to then be told your princess is in another castle. However, these jokes can be very corny at times when ALL of the games you play pretty much constantly make these references. This game does but a lot of twist on these classic references to other games, but not enough to not come across as corny. But that could be just me. A lot of people love these random references for some reason...Great game! Pick it up for prices anywhere below 30 dollars. Except if you are me and you have too many fighting games to play.

Do you have an empty void in your life that can only be filled by putting as much Mexican goodness as you can in it? Do you want to see a giant chicken in a sombrero with a matching poncho? Do you want to become a chicken and lay eggs that explode? Do you think you're a bad enough hombre to rescue El Presidente's daughter? Then this is the game for you!

And sometimes I get to be a chicken. It is everything I didn't know I wanted in a Metroidvania.Before I bought it, I thought this was a go-to-the-right-beat-em-up like the arcade version of TMNT or THE SIMPSONS. But then it came up during a lookup of Metroidvanias and I had a closer look. I still wasn't quite sure if it was the game for me. THEN there was a sale--get the Super Turbo Championship Edition, Gold Edition, AND soundtrack for $6. I couldn't pass up the deal.Since the Super Turbo version looked to be the more ""complete"" version of the game, I deleted the Gold version and started my GUACAMELEE journey.This game does a ton of things right. Checkpoints are generous. The beat 'em up sections are fun to complete, even when playing on a keyboard. Miss a platform jump (in a series of them over water), and instead of going back to a last checkpoint, you go to the last bit of solid ground you stood on. THANK YOU, GUACAMELEE, FOR RESPECTING MY TIME.I groused at first about the lack of double-jump, but in the end, I was glad they made me use the Rooster Punch so often, because then I discovered its versatility. Then when I did get double jump, I found myself using it differently.Within hours, I was zipping across the neon landscape like a champ, goat-jumping off walls while switching dimensions and punching skeletons in the face like a stud. THAT'S what I play platformers for.The abilities upgrade system is a little weak -- at times it was hard to see how spending pesos improved said abilities--As a kid, I fell in love with Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for its dark-yet-fun horror-gothic vibe. I grew up with the Donkey Kong Country games. I've played nearly all the Nifflas platformers, which have a chill mystique. GUACAMELEE has the wonderful quality of movement of ALL those games PLUS a zesty feast for your eyes and ears, the most festive, fun platformer I've played in a L O N G time.Come for the platforming, stay for the art. And chicken."

Colorful graphics, good gameplay, and a funny story. The enemies can get a bit repetitive towards the end with piles of enemies coming from multiple dimensions. The music is very catchy and fits very well with the theme of the game. Overall a really fun, but short game."
