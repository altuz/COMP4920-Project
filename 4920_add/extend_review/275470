Don't really like that updated review will still be somewhere on the bottom of the list. Also i want to do it justice. Developers of this game are super cool for supporting their game long after the release and trying to find a way to please all the gamers. Controls are now WAY better than they were (now it actually selects tiles, not the objects on the tiles and there is a visual cue what object will be selected if you click your mouse button, also they've added more alternate controls options). For such great support only they deserve a Yes.The game itself is a mix of puzzle and speed. I don't really like the speed element, especially when the puzzle element itself can be mind boggling alone, and then you have to do all very fast. But that's just me. And you can still do just puzzles, if you don't want to earn every star (sorry, light bulb) on a level. Artistic style is cartoonish and pleasant. There is also a shop in the game to spend your dollars earned for completing the levels and doing extra bonus things on some levels. You can buy outfits for your characters :) It's a bit silly, but still, you are using those points you are collecting, not just playing for the highscore and if you are a completionist it may be fun to buy all the outfits and complete some achievements along. All in all a little pretty puzzle game with a nice support. But if you don't like the speed element, maybe you should skip it or play just the puzzle parts, though many of them still require to move objects in time."

There is a problem with the controls for the game. many times timing is the key to solving puzzles. If you can't click the blocks to move them in time then you can't solve it. My son and I tried many many times knowing the solution but being unable to actualize it because the game wouldn't let us click the blocks fast enough.I would honestly LOVE to give this a thumbs up, but the controls are a real deal breaker guys, sorry."

Sure it has its cons: the item-mouse interaction is sometimes not responsive (yet always seems to be fine when the timer is active), the screen rez is small with no way to change, and there are no potatoes.  However, the way the devs include various solutions to certain levels is beautiful.  Other games have done this (hitman GO, quell series, etc.) and I LOVE IT whenever they do.  I must mention though that I think Chip's model of multiple solutions is by far the best I have seen.  One of the biggest reasons is the more difficult solutions for levels with multiple solutions are the solutions needed to get the bags of coins and presents.  These are prefeal items that only benefit you anesthesiatically, yet they require a big cognitive load of the gamer.  The irony is ironically ironic.  Buy the damn game FOOS!!!!"

Even after having solved the puzzle mentally, it often took 6-10 attempts to actually complete the level because of timing and controls are very unforgiving. I hoped the second set of puzzles that unlocked would have more interesting puzzles, nope, more of the same ridiculously timing-driven object manipulation.

Sometimes, there is also a ""gift"" to collect on the way. And the solution you find for one of these will not be necessarily work for the other (especially, collecting gifts often use a different route than the others).In total, you have 75 levels (a few levels are merely tutorials, though), but you can consider that you have more if you want to finish the game at 100%.All in all, a few hours of fun, with a relaxing soundtrack.To sum up :+ Good scaling difficulty+ Some levels need to be beaten 3 times in a different way to get everything+ Special levels to unlock in each world+ 3 character skins, which can be customized in a funny way- Missclicks are common on the game items, each one forcing to restart the level when trying to complete the game (thanksfully, it's restarting fast)"

No Volume slidebars available.You are able to customize your character the way you want too.About the game.The game is very simple. You click on a cannon to fire an energy ball. This energy ball has to reach the robot in order to complete the level. The energy ball is able to bounce off from walls in order to reach the robot. The ball speed is pretty slow which could give you enough time to think.Each level has 3 light bulbs/Stars. This depends on how many moves you spend, How fast you do and the normal completion. The light bulbs are needed to unlock other levels.You are able to unlock other characters. But it is only for the looks. NO PURPOSES!There are collectables, which i find totally unnecessary and might ruin the game.You can change the looks for your character.There is some kind of story line.Game is very repetitive.Has many levels.Other things.The puzzle is okay. It has to be your kind of taste.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10"

You  just point and click. Move objects around to navigate a ball of energy to hit Chip and wake him up.I've only played a few levels so far and the puzzles are pretty easy in the beggining which allows you to get the hang of how the game works.If you are a prefectionist however it will be pretty challenging beating the clock (beating the clock isnt necessary in order to beat the level).I expect that itll be harder since you will be moving obstacles here and there to prevent the evergy ball from hitting the obstacles as you navigate it across the level to Chip the robot.-------------One thing about this game that kind of pisses me off is that whenever I click on an object its like the game doesnt detect my clicks until the 2nd or 3rd time I click. This leads to misclicks and that leads to not being able to beat the clock.-----------Other than that the game is great for people who love puzzle games. It's fairly cheap and a nice simple game to play and kill some time with if you're bored.

It's a standard puzzle game that looks like it belongs on an iPhone or an Android phone, because of its simple design, short levels and simple scoring system that's identical to the system in Bad Piggies, but this is not the case.  Despite what you may think at first, some of the levels in this game can make you stop dead in your tracks to think about your actions throughoutly before you actually do something, because this game has very high demands for both time and the amount of moves you make. And getting the top rating is actually quite important, because unlocking bonus levels and other level packs depends on your ratings throughout the game. You move cannons, magnets and bouncy walls and turn them around to create a clear path from the cannon to the robot, which you can customize. Some of the customizations for the robots make me worried about this game being struck with lawsuit- being given Finn's hat from Adventure Time, the Magatama from Ace Attorney, etc. The graphics I find very cute, even though they look like they were made in Adobe Flash. Overall, I like the game, but the game, but it's a little too expensive- quickly, nag it before the sale ends! :)"

,Recommended,275470,29262672,Posted: 14 January,all,Oscarilloscope,"This puzzle game has a steady introduction of puzzle mechanics that leads to an occasionally frustrating, but overall satisfying puzzle experience.The puzzles on this game are well designed and most have solutions that, while requiring careful planning, are not dependent on hidden game mechanics. The majority of puzzles have at least one solution which doesn't require ninja reflexes, and level unlocks are partially based on cumulative progress, so even if you don't have the eyes of an eagle and the arms of a praying mantis, you should be able to view all the cutscenes.The payouts for level completion are generous, so obtaining a variety of outfits for your character(s) is relatively easy, but there are unlockables that require alternate puzzle solves. Overall the gameplay is enjoyable and should provide solid puzzling on the first pass-through while leaving a fair bit of non-grindy content for a second run (although those seeking 100% acheivements will likely find a few levels that will require a great many consecutive refreshes to memorize and complete the speed, treasure, or special solve).The in-line tutorial has a fair progression introducing new mechanics in the levels that first require them, but as this is a precision speed-clicker, even after you have played for several hours you will almost certainly find yourself clicking a few pixels off of the mark now and again; which in certain puzzles requiring split-bullet-time-timing will cost you a level restart. This problem is exacerbated on certain levels and menu items by the poor UI scaling that occurs at certain resolutions.What I didn't like:As a completionist, the most annoying thing about this game was that on levels that had tutorial pop-ups, they trigger every time you replay the level with no option to disable them. This was especially frustrating on a few levels that had timing elements to the puzzle and would trigger pop-ups in the middle of the solve, requiring players to click to clear the pop-up, then race the cursor across the screen to trigger the next step. A mis-click would necessitate a reset to acheive the speed clear or other condition(and also reset the tutorial pop-ups).At the time of review I have played 8.4 hours."
