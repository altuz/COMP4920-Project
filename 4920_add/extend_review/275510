I cannot stress enough how this is totally different from the from version of this game.  Cutscenes are gone, visual controls are garbage, all robots, vehicles and buildings appear as being black so it is very hard to tell what is yours and what isn't.  Pyros shoot nothing just a flamethrower sound and I can't speak for most of the other units in the game because your technicians won't capture the fort in the beginning of the first forest level and basically the game can't proceed. This game is major leage broken and an absolute crap remake of a really good original."

Had better sound track for some reason in this one you can hear the looping of the music, its far too noticable and dosnt seem to change for me on game states. For example in the original the music changed when a squad of men were under attack but now the music is just stuck on repeat for me.Secondly what happened to the robots, they used to look like military robots, robots that actually fitted in with what u would expect to see in future combat situations, now they look like gimped out crash dummies?My advice to anyone is try and find a copy of the original and get it if you can. Otherwise wait for this one to get its problems sorted. Its really great trying to bring the Z series into the new era of gaming i hate to be critical of an old friend of mine but i only want to see it do the best it can and it can do so much more. Please dont give up and take this onboard as constructive criticism i want to see Z steel soldier reach the levels it is capable of.-Update- Dev has replied and has told in comments this is a known issue and is getting sorted will remove from review when it is-On playing further - the bunkers in the game do not take damage. Stuck on the lasar mission because i cant destroy the bunker - kinda stupid that ur sitting there with 20 jeeps 20 psychos and 20 pyros all shooting at this bunker and it dosnt drop any health  ? ? ?"

It is a fairly standard old skool RTS, unlike the first one, which was more about just holding zones. Now you can choose which buildings and zones to invest in. The humour is still here and the units are varied. The AI can be frustrating at times, for instance I lost several units as they destroyed the bridge they were standing on trying to shoot at a lone Psycho! If you adapt your play style to this though you can soon avoid embarrassing losses. The graphics have also been updated enough to make them look acceptable by today's standards. The comic strip cut scenes were removed but have been put back, which I am also glad about. This is a fun game with nostalgic value but also a good RTS for younger fans."

This game makes no pretentions, it is a stripped down RTS, but it is stripped down in a good way. The map is divided into territories, holding territories increases your income, denying territories to your opponent denies them theirs. It's all about moving tactically between these zones and defending your command centre. You have land, sea and air units, it's all quite simple and that is basically the  (very addictive) game.As for the story: it is very zany, comic book style and darkly humorous. It's a sci-fi storyline which is told between levels in cutscenes (and also via radio chatter while you're playing). Now the game is story driven in a very simple way i.e. cutscenes set up the level and your objectives form a part of the overall storyline. You could skip all the story without really affecting the game, but it's worth watching if you get the humour.This is a remastered edition but don't expect AAA graphics, it's the simplicity of this while remaining challenging is what makes it an enduring classic for me. You can just pick it up and play, you don't need to invest time in learning how to control it. An absolute classic, great for scratching a quick strategy itch. Well worth getting this remastered edition for this sale price."

The main difference like many have said, no hotkeys/shortcuts, cutscenes, skirmish and online multiplayer, main menu is different, plus many other features missing, now remember this is the first build and not the final, the devs have said the features, mainly cutscenes and skirmishes will come in updates in the future.I am only about 4 missions into the game and like I said above, I am enjoying playing this, I am currently waiting till the cutscenes are added so I can enjoy watching and follow the story. I am grateful of the devs to bring this out so I can finally enjoy this game hassel free and finally complete it, I own the original 2001 release, PC at the time (Win 98 with basic hardware) made the game lag really bad when you get about halfway of the story, my WIn 7 laptop played it but with recurring crashes, and now my current Win 8 just seems to crash before I get to the main menu.Overall I like the game, nice start with updated visuals with more features to come, if you concerned about the missing features, can wait till the updated version and see what others think, or you are a fan that doesn't mind the changes or lack of content (like me) then go for it."

Unfortunately unlike its  predecessor, the modern version has no gamma correction and in many cases the graphics are too dark. The GT630 is more then capable of dealing with this modern version, but cannot tweek the gamma. There is a problem with the units as well, there are no individual lables to signify which soldier you selected, I am having trouble telling the difference between a tech-unit and a psycho, I have to listen to the audio to know who I have selected. In a fire fight you have not got the time to zoom back in in order to select individuals, then zoom out on the map to see where the skirmish is and select reinforcements to the area quickly.The previous version in many cases has certain advantages over its replacement, you know what you are selecting and where you want to put the units at a moments notice; even when you have zoomed out to see the bigger picture. Without scratching your head in a firefight, wondering if you have selected the right unit or not. A gamma correction in the game could make all the difference in detail between winning or losing and seeing who you have selected. If these problems can be resolves, it would be a great game. I played the previous version dozens of times before  and after XP came out, and I never get bored with it.

The new gameplay and UI need some time to get used to, but I believe it's actually smoother than in the original and brings Steel Soldiers closer to the simple, arcade, fast-paced gameplay of the first Z, while retaining all the new buildings and units.The improved graphics are a mixed bag for me. I appreciate the improved textures and FX, but the bots have been redesigned and have lost much of what gave them personnality in the first place.My biggest complaint is the absence of skirmish and multiplayer modes. The campaign is cool and has a pretty good story, but sometimes you just want to play a map with the full toybox.All in all, it's a pretty decent port of a great game, that only lacks a few game modes to become a good port."

But the flaws of this game are pretty straight-foward:1) The models look nice, but the moving animation is stiff and cheaply made2) Some models were scrapped and look just like a regular unit, for example Lassar3) The units dont stay where you want them to be. Example: i want some GPT`s to stay on a ridge3 to overlook an area, but i cant put them one next to the other without one oif them driving of. I wouldnt complain if this distance would be short but its way too long, so that my tactics dont work4) The window you can use to select more units is glitchy and doesnt always select units.5) The construction bots are glitched out while building and have the tendency to run around and get lost, the originals didnt do that6) The unit production window is uselessly simple, just taking the old one would be better7) The game crashes pretty often8) the saving options are weird and dont work properly9) there is no ""retry"" option in the pause menuI think i could come up with more complaints, but i noticed those from just a few hours of gameplay.Its very sad that this makeover was so dissappointing, maybe just updating the models while using the original animations and skeletons and updating the textures weould have been a better idea."
,Recommended,275510,11770750,"Posted: 18 August, 2014",all,Morriginko,"At this moment of time, i'd reccomend this game to people who are hard-boiled Z:SS fans or Z series fans who don't mind having Early Access game. The keywords here areat this moment of time.Yep, this game does feel a bit like Early Access. There are some bugs and glitches here and there, most frequent of them are invincible bunkers (protip - bring some Pyros, their attacks ignore terrain at all) and targeting glitch, which makes your cursor think it's still on enemy building (it made me fail mission 12). Other bugs include units being stuck in buildings, units being unable to enter buildings (makes mission 18 unwinnable), untis reacting weird when under attack (I once had psycho running halfway around the map to retaliate to a guy who just popped up from nearby bridge), and minor non-gamebreaking bugs.Compared to original, graphics have been improved (original units looked like voodoo dolls of low-poly models; i could count polygons on those on my fingers), howerver there is a problem with bloom sometimes, plus bump mapping on some models look a bit over the top. Some units have been changed in their look, like Toughs now represtent robotic heavy weapons guy from TF2, only armed with homing missile launchers instead of machineguns, and mobile radar jammer now wheeled vehicle instead of tracked one it used to be. Generally, robots look more human than they were supposed to in original game concept-art, and some buildings feel like they've been enlarged and rescaled (worst case with robot factory and air hangar - the former feels a bit bloated, the latter has huge control tower).My major complain so far is the interface. It's horrible, feels console-ish, and does not present some vital infromation, like balance of income and expences, timer in timed missions, unit count and upgrade levels.But as far as gampelay goes, it still feels like i'm back in original ZSS: grab a handful of psychos, take as much of the flags on a map as you can, build up a strike group and go wipe the map with your enemies. Or, watch them wipe map with your troops, if you've miscalculated something. The latter however right now is entirely your fault, since there are no difficulty setting, and AI is somewhat clueless on what's it doing (however, on mission 14 AI tried to drop a light tank and two pyros on my command center via transport heli - never seen AI doing that in original).Multiplayer and Skirmish modes are missing so far, and i can't get clear understanding if devs will impliment them anytime soon/late.Finally, the sounds are taken right from original Z:SS, as wel as music tracks (and projectile models, save for Laser's - it's much brighter than original one was). However, currently there is a problem with music: it stucks in a loop and never ends. Even ""mission successful"" music. So, i dunno, pop your favorite epic techo playlist while you're at it? :DSo, as i said: get this if you're either hard-boiled Z:Steel Soldiers fan, or if you're Z series fan and don't mind game being a bit raw at the moment. Or if you like buying raw games and then complain on forums. Otherwise, wait."

Below are my thoughts about this remastered version...- The developers have kept almost everything from the base game intact but have updated the game with new visuals, new models, UI etc. to match that of, for example, the older C&C Generals games instead of keeping the very old and outdated graphics from 2001.(By the way, all sounds are that from the base game.)- The devs are constantly updating this game, some features from the old classic game wasn't compatible with newer systems and so the devs are working around the clock to roll out updates frequently, just about two days ago the old cinematics were re-added to the game.(Skrimish is due around this month.)Based on my own personal opinion i recommend this game, the only flaw i've encountered is that some of the later Campaign missions are extremely difficult but aside from that this is a solid return of an old classic!Zod is back!!!"

Aside from one patch that helped with animations, very little has changed since my initial review. Therefore, I can't say that I still recommend this game, and would instead recommend tracking down a copy of the original. It hasn't aged well graphically, but the gameplay is superior to this port.First thing out of the way- the only thing in this game right now is the campaign mode, the same from the original SS.It's definitely a work-in-progress. I just popped my old copy of SS in and played it, and then played this version. It's much more touch-friendly for touch devices since it was just released on Google Play (and maybe the App Store?) very recently. This is very evident in the UI. Being able to scale the size of the game would be very helpful, as for having a 1080p monitor I should be able to zoom out far more.Keeping in mind it's a work-in-progress, here are my observations after having played through the first world of the game:---Pros:+ Same great gameplay from the original.+ The cutscenes are back, as are the original voices. None of that has changed.+ Campaign now ""rates"" you out of 3 stars (a la Angry Birds) for your performance. It has no effect on unlocking campaign levels.+ Textures look much nicer. Not all of them, however (see below)Cons:- Skirmish is not here (but coming, as the developer has announced)- not optimized for large displays (the icons are huge, perhaps for touch device friendliness?)- No MP (yet)- Can't customize controls as far as I've seen so far- Music has very noticeable looping- Can't use Build Repeat on buildings- Too many unnecessary animations in the menus (hiding loading times, perhaps?)- Textures are updated, which means a very different art style. Others have likened this to looking like ""crash dummies"" and for some parts I would agree. I personally prefered the older art style because they looked more like off-the-line robots rather than things with personality (which the hero units should have!) but to each their own.- Units run on the air. Or at least, that's what it looks like. Their feet and shadows don't line up and it looks really odd.Other thoughts:= I would really love it if the developer could also include the nice build animation from the original (or something like it!) because it was really cool to see the lines slowly build and the ""walls"" slowly form on buildings. It's a much more jarring animation now but is still in stages. A decrease in the animations for ""right-clicking"" on units would be great, too. It just seems like it makes it take more time than it needs to.= The menu background graphic is kind of odd- I'm not sure why it's there, as it doesn't really have a lot to do with the game's setting.= The globe is nice for giving a sense of perspective for where the battles are taking place in the campaign, but it's HUGE. Seeing all the levels/making the transition better would be cool.= PLEASE try to find a way to bring back the old economy UI! Being able to see your income differential was much better than just having a ticker with how much money you currently have.Bugs so far- Bunkers having HUGE amounts of health/it not being hit properly; units climbing up cliffs when they should not be able to jump that distance; Units not being able to be hit when standing next to (but not blocked by) a building.It's also hard sometimes to select certain units in a group. At times units will clump up and then you can't ever select one, it selects all.----That all being said, I still do enjoy the game. Is it as enjoyable as the previous incarnation? Not yet. Hopefully it will be! I'm looking forward to seeing how things turn out. I don't regret purchasing this *yet*, but I'll check back in a couple of months to see how it's progressed.Recommendation: YES, though be prepared to be disappointed a little, especially if you expect the exact same game with a facelift. The developers are sincerely looking at feedback and that's reassuring."

I had huge difficulties to get the controlls right. Maybe after a while one would get used to it. But this is more a casual game to mee.

Instructions are very unclear (Unless you bought a physical copy of the game and have the 59 page manual), the help menu is not much but the fundamentals of gameplay are as every RTS game and brings nothing new to the genre, the game is 15 years old by the way. It's your generic RTS game with the AI stuck on Blitzkrieg mode. Litterally, prepare to be absolutely swarmed by a AI that doesn't give a damn what difficulty you have it set to. 5 minutes in and if you haven't played  such a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game as this in years, you're essentialy a goner. The AI has a great advantage over you in every way shape and form. Here are a few examples: The AI can build everything faster and apparently has thousands of resource units at their disposal, much more than what can be set at the settings screen for the match, they can instantaneously build war units to attack your premature base only 5 minutes into the match while you're still sitting their waiting forever for your own buildings and units be made while using up what little resources you have because the settings don't apply to you, and then when you look around the map in only 5 seconds of th game's begining, the AI already conuered 75% of the map space while you were barely keeping yourself alive. All in all it's essentially a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ C&C esque game that is barely functional with it missing a lot of options and gameplay mechanics. Don't buy this game unless you want to play a horrible RTS game."

I am ashamed to say I was caught up in nostalgia.I have watched as fewer and fewer updates have rolled in, and the game is worse off then when it started.Repeat build was never added. Multiplayer was never added. Bugs seem to be rampant and customers seem to be ignored.Unless something changes on the developers side, don't bother. I will work on a guide to get the original game working for you on your machine, and yes I can get it to work on multiplayer as well (maybe). I had more resources at my disposal 5 years ago.If enough folks want the original to work again, just let me know. It is better then what this developer has peddled."

If you were a fan of the original like I was this was a must buy.Good re amp of an older title.Easy to pick up and play RTS title just with a small twist of obtaining territories for money rather than building e.g. a base near a mine.
