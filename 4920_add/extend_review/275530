Much closer to the original game, especially with the removal of the video borders.A few recommendations based on Zod Engine and the orignal to the devs:-Game pause needs to be improved, should pause within game while still allowing you to issue orders. Original game allowed in-game pause like this.-Multiplayer is really a must, you're on Steam, use their in-built matchmatching. Orignal game had multiplayer, Zod Engine has multiplayer, you should have multiplayer.-Consider 2-click scheme option for select unit and issue order.-Please improve the menus, still terrible.-------------------Original Posted on 4 Jul @ 6:07pm:Low resolution, terrible menus, no multiplayer, very awkward controls. I thought I'd support a classic I enjoyed, but honestly, just go on Google and type in Zod Engine to get a way better implentation for free, with multiplayer support, better controls, and even a linux release, and for some reason far better looking textures and full-screen high-res support.The developers really lost a chance here because there is still a crowd for this game and they really blew it with this pathetic release. They couldn't do better than a free release.I want my money back, thanks for butchering my childhood!"

Non PC Users) but still has many of those bugs reported prior to August 2014 going back to release. Its controls are still clunky, we don't have a level editor or the Z95 missions, we still have stupid bugs like Toughs and Pyros not being able to destroy buildings. The pathfinding is still worse than the original and so forth.But the devs have their game on the mobile market where they can make their money from impulse buys and people who don't care about the game beyond a 10 minute tap fest on their slates and won't moan too much about bugs and oddities.All those promises to the PC users and the Steam Users have not been acted on, no patch ever materialised and the devs have been missing in (non-)action since August 2014.Don't buy this game, support the original and locate a legit copy on ebay or amazon or somewhere else, then use the WinXP/Vista/7 launcher to run it. You'll enjoy the game a whole lot more than you would with this shamble of a remake, plus you'll have the Z95 editor, mods and improved controls, all the things you won't get here.Support this type of game by not buying this remake and going for the original.Buy the remake and you are only supporting cash grabbing devs who only seem to care about mobile compatibility and ride along on a string of broken promises and non-communication with the PC community."

Like many other Steam ports, this is not an upgrade, but downgrade.Please don't give them money until they make a proper PC port(of a game that was originally on PC), not iOS/Android port with broken UI and AI.UI is made for touchscreens, painful to use.Pathfinding and unit AI are still atrocious, units will stop and refuse to move for no reason, plan crazy routes, get stuck in broken bridges instead of making a detour, walk straight into a wall, refuse to shoot, etc. etc...As result, bue to bugs, it is very easy to complete, unlike the original.During cutscenes sound will temporarily disappear. Music could use some improvements, sometimes it is very repetitive.Screen scrolls slowly for some reason, with much lower framerate than it should have.

Is this true? is it hell! this is a complete lie.Z is one of my favorite childhood memories sitting down playing this after school with my big brother on our playstation 1. Back in the good old ays this game was absolutely great and it's the reason I got into strategy games. I'll be honest, I saw this game and instantly payed for it to try and re-live some of my youth and it is very similar to the way I remember it being (although I now hate my brother lol). The slight changes they've made to make it control better with the PC aren't all that great, it gives you a few tabs at the bottom to select all units of a certain type to save you dragging boxes around all your units (which I still did anyway). the game plays just how it used to and is a great blast from the past, however... is this a good port? no, not at all. the resolution is appauling in this day and age and to actually get the game working I had to mess around with my monitor to actually see anything. Personally I will put up with this just because I'm such a huge fan of this games and have great memories with it, but advising this to someone who wants to play a competant strategy game would be very difficult.So on that that basis I can't recommend this game and am giving it a thumbs down. the game itself is great fun but it's severly let down by the amount of effort put in to making this run on a PC. Unless you're like me and played this when you were younger and just want to have a little bash on it without searching in your attic for your old console and disc then yeah it's not a huge price to pay, but I won't recommend it to anyone else unless they do some serious work into making it more PC friendly and if they do I will edit my review accordingly.thanks for reading x"

If they do, I will fix and update my review as well.While the original Bitmap Brothers game was fantastic, the new developer TickTock Games managed to butcher most aspects of the game they touched.I did not want to believe the negative reviews but unfortunately they are right.Even though the developers claimed they might fix some things and add the much needed multiplayer After the first 3 very minor updates there is still a long list of issues before this can be recommended.They first made a mobile version and then just put it on Steam without any significant changes. This leads to several frustrating aspects, especially in all the controls and functions from the original game not working any more (repair stations etc.)The language localization that was taken from the original game is good but everything they added is worse than Google Translate.>About the original gameIn a time where RTS was mainly about first gathering resources and building a base, The Bitmap Brothers made something radically different. Instead of resources you capture the sectors of the map which have factories and facilities already on them - the only resources are time and the sectors you hold - the more you control, the faster your units are built and then send to destroy the enemy fort (by attacking it from afar or sneaking any unit through the front entrance to sabotage it). In the beginning of the match you will have to race your opponent to capture sectors or sometimes empty vehicles or artillery that are scattered across the the map. You can even try to snipe the driver out of vehicles and then capture them yourself.With a simple gameplay and a set of about 15 units the game offered still amazing strategic possibilities.So whether you are a fan of the 1995 MSDos classic or only just stumbled upon this: Do yourself a favor and look for the original open source remake Zod Engine (multiplayer) instead, because what TickTock has done to the game is not worthy of Commander Zod."

These iteration of ""Z"" has not much in common in many important things and ways with the original release:- no short cuts on keyboard- cheating A.I; for example you got more attacking units being offensive vs. 1! enemy but you still loose the battle in a mystical way- annoying automatical ""group- binding"" or ""unit- binding"", that means units are automatically grouped and you have all the time to disgroup manually, very confusing and uncomfortable, leading to unit losses and time loss in navigation- stupid menu- navigation and general ugly, no original layouts- different interface to original, not almost as comfortable as known before- unbalanced gameplay in difference to original- bad♥♥♥♥♥controls in contrast to original- strange unit ""reactions"" like non- shooting, non- walking, long-way- taking- general bad pathfinding..- LEVELS MISSING!and so on...I am sure I forget some bad things.

While the original superior 1996 Version developed by this UK companyhttp://www.bitmap-brothers.co.uk/front.htmcan still be obtained and free for download doing a relatively quick web search or alternatively a remake version which is better, larger and supports multiplayer is also ‘FREE’ and can be obtained herehttp://zod.sourceforge.net/I myself having watched a few YouTube videos of the original easily saw that the original was faster and contained a better and friendlier UI. So why the $7? What makes this one more deserving of money?Gameplay consists of simply you against the AI, Blue against Red and with the small army you’re originally allocated you must move individuals from your squad to capture flags in various territories. Once a territory is captured you can start building structures which manufacture soldiers units or defence units or assault vehicles and aircraft. The more territories you have captured the less time manufacturing takes, but the more powerful the units also the more time it takes. Match offcourse concludes when you take over the opposing forces fort and a space ship comes down to move your army to another location or planet. Most of the missions are exactly the same with the only difference being that your opponent AI will start off with a greater arsenal than you and have more of a greater ability at capturing landmarks and keeping you off bay. This demands more skill in you effectively commanding your troops which can be very tedious and aggravating due to bad path finding implemented in the game.The games animation cut scenes remain the same as the original and look horrible in comparison today’s HD standards. One questions why they didn’t bring them up to date to appeal to even a greater audience?In final RTS which has stood the test of time because of its well thought out game mechanics and still has a huge cult following. While it could be argued that this game has sent many down memory lane and has introduced a few more new players to this RTS history lesson. Still that lingering question remains why would you buy this product when there are better versions out there free?“Yes Save Your Butt!!!”Below is a small sample of the original 1996 version that I found of someone else playing.

The original Z was released in 1996 and became a cult hit for its twist on real time strategy.However, this here is not that game. It's the PC-port of the (2011) iOS-port of that game and itshows! You can even find the files for the iOS manual in the Steam folder and the tutorial still tells you totapthe screen.Much of the original gameplay is still there and enthusiasts of classic real time strategy will find much to like here. The biggests downsides of the porting are however a less intuitive and more complicated control system (which can cost you seconds giving orders in comparison to the original) and a messy UI that fails to give you vital information quickly.While I still love the game itself it is a far inferior version to the original game. This version doesn't even include the 10 extra levels from the Win95 Expansion. So if you're interested in Z, better get Z95 off amazon, ebay or somewhere else."

The controls, they are absolutely terrible, the mouse feels clunk and unresponsive, WASD doesn't scroll the screen and you are forced to drag and move like if this were a mobile game(oh wait, they ported it from MOBILE), the shortcuts from the old game don't work and you have weird situations like when the game autogroups a bunch of units; you are stuck with them grouped forever because there is no way to delete the group.2. The UI, original one was perfect, it gave you the exact amount of information needed. Now, I don't know why, they REMOVED things, WHY? Why would you remove anything?? And the minimap is useless, im playing at 1900x1080p and its the size of a pea, may aswell just remove it. They have remade things that were just perfect in the original.3. I play in English but also tried German and Spanish just to check the translations, and they are TERRIBLE, totally broken, the spanish one even has Italian words and sentences...4.

Units or vehicles get stuck behind rabbit holes or small obstacles which as far as I used to recall they used to go around or destroy.2. Troops tend to be unwilling to get in APCs, which makes building those a huge gamble as you probably can't use them.3. Pyros and toughs won't attack buildings as they used to, which is another tactical limitation.4. vehicle route AI is pretty poor - part of the fun of the game was always the fact that troops and vehicles could be a bit dumb, but again this seems worse than previously.5. Repair facilities don't seem to work.It's still pretty good but I'm a bit disappointed by these shortcomings. I would be grateful if there is a patch that has been developed.I am glad to be playing it again but I think a new player might find the bugs quite frustrating. If they were fixed I would have no hesitation at recommending this game.EDIT:It's over a year on, and the developers seem to have given up on this game and not fixed the bugs. The bugs make playing the game beyond a certain level extremely difficult if not impossible.I signed up with Steam solely in order to play this game, and I'm afraid my experience has made me  a little wary about buying other games on Steam."

Bitmap Brothers did a great job on that 1996.Sadly this is not a PC remake, but just a mobile platform port with all the limitations of a mobile platform... It just doesn't feel right to have an UI, designed for a Phone or a Tablet on a PC.Horrible controls for PC. AI bugs especially with path finding (worse than the ones in the original game). etc.There are huge problems especially with Infantry Units' movement and firing. Also the Toughs' projectiles seem to be buggy compared to the original game.Unit AI is kind of weird. often Infantry Units get stuck near objects. When near enemy units often only one troop member attacks. The other ones are just walking around.Cursor selection and utility needs some improvements. Especially with turret guns. Often you make a robot leave a defensive turret by accident.Also you took away the possibility to make a rotating defensive turret keeping watch towards a direction of an approaching enemy, because you no longer can give an attack order out of the turrets range. This is taking away a lot of power from turrets. This was never a bug in the original game!It was a good micro management feature!The lack of a multiplayer is somehow disappointing. Even the original game had one in 1996(!).I know my review sounds harsh. But I am a software dev myself and I grew up with games like Z.Don't get me wrong. I think the idea to do a Z remake is great and I respect your attempt to do so. But a mobile platform port won't do the trick for a Z audience.In Conclusion it is definetly a nice game to play on your smartphone or a tablet while being bored, travelling by train, sitting in a bus or something similar. But it's just not right for a PC experienced Z audience.If you want to have the real Z feeling, get the original game and emulate it.Or even simpler, get the Zod Engine. It is basically a 1:1 remake of the old Z, with better controls and a working multiplayer!And it is free!The Developer of Zod Engine did it alone.You should`ve hired that guy.Edit: After further testing I found out there is a bug with tanks as well. If you give them an attack order with 2 enemies in it's range it will always attack the closest one, no matter wich one you told him to attack.And at least alter that UI a bit..."

If you have the original Z CD, do yourself a favour and keep it - you wont get a better Z experience.This piece of junk works well at achieving what Z did and then BREAKS it further: it has numerous ' bugs' or examples of things that are really frustrating I shall try to list them, but the problem is the design of the game as well as it's workings.-As an RTS, there are no key bindings other than the mouse buttons-As an RTS, left click handles a single selection and single command (much like you may touch a screen with your finger)- As an RTS right click is to move the screen around the battle field(Similarly to dragging your finger on the screen...)So given these statements I believe this was meant to be a mobile port..  Heres a few things I dont like about Z (the remake)- Bugged AI gets lost and collects units behind blown out bridges - never happened on Z the original)- Bugged AI Pathfinding is HORRENDOUS - Never have I seen such a mess as this, and the original has PERFECT pathfinding which tracked along roads and onto the other side of a map... This? cannot find its way 100m/yards down the road!-The HUD is in a windowed mode, meaning you have the battle field and your window to display 1 unit's details (the x to close a window is used throughout). If I close a unit's details window - I cannot get it back... Sometimes for the duration of a battle... Soooo, consider I have a gold star veteran heavy tank: I cant check if he needs repairs, so he is as good as dead, and units are worth keeping in this game...-To deselect a unit I MUST select another unit or give it an order - this is really bad design-I am certain the left click key is inconsistent how to works, look out for this possibly leading to other flaws.I wont go on, but really, this is designed badly and looks bad and does not flow well either; Look at how Zod Launcher runs - now that is how Z should run. This, even at 1024 x 800 will have the engine run and around what I 'predict' to be 30FPS? its slow trust me... Then the actual rendering is blocky as hell to boot! I never looked as sharp as Zod-Launcher even if it was 1900x XXXX res! - please test it - don't take my word for an answer if you have the game.(Or look it up on Youtube!)Don't bother buying it! - download Zod-Launcher for free(or try that first), though it is set out like a Multiplayer server client, runs 10x better than this and keeps the animations and the extra battle chatter ( and the ""as minimalist as it needs to be"" Hud). You can also play whatever level you want when ever you want.If you want all the FMV's and the 'single player mode' then you could buy this, but the gameplay is way under-par when compared to the bots on Zod Launcher. A word of warning though, the 'Zod launcher' AI seems to know what it's doing!In saying all that though the game is more frustrating than normal and far less fulfilling; but it works and can 'Emulate' Z."

Games they produced already on Steam include The Chaos Engine and Speedball 2 HD. At the time they made very cool games that were both dark and comedic at the same time. This game sees you capturing territories with robots in jeeps and tanks whilst defending your fort. The animation is cute and it is actually quite challenging to get through the levels. There is only the story mode though and no multiplayer but it is still fun and stays true to the original. The way you move your troops reminds me of Cannon Fodder. This is where my my main criticism comes as they haven't moved with the times. Path Finding is not great and you have to click on each unit individually to move them, which leads to frustation when you notice them getting stuck on things as you are fighting on multiple fronts.

At least in it units weren't moving back and forth while being shot at! Snipers are currently completely useless - they are easily taken out by mounted guns with shorter range. Why? Because snipers keep on moving closer, instead of shooting from maximum range.APC are often useless as well - 2 out of 3 times APC gets ""broken"" after unloading units from it - can't move it and can't load any units into it.I could go on.There is one big plus however - it motivated me to find DOS original game and play it in DosBox.

Z eliminates most of the tedium that usually comes with RTS games, choosing to focus on tactics and management of assets. The gameplay is relatively straightforward. Each map is divided into territories, which the player must capture. Territories contain assets like factories and radar stations. The more territories a player controls, the more quickly their factories produce units. More powerful units require more time to construct. Players must marshal their forces and constantly keep them moving in order to succeed.I was very excited to see this classic title released on Steam, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the RTS genre, robots, and irreverent humor."

It is still fun to play, robots and their communication with you is hillarious. Bitmap Brothers take on RTS game is different and with this kinda gameplay you really have to think strategic to win every level.. Every decision is crucial and makes a different..It could be bad, because I kinda feel tricked when developers don't add anything to this old games. They could at least work on cutscenes, make it hd or something.. They don't add any new thing to game play and it is kinda hard to play in high-res. Robots are too small and mouse arrow is too small to micro-manage everything. You have to select units everytime you need to give them orders. Menus are out of date and not very user-friendly. Also it would be great if you can select the level you want to play (like in red alert 3 or warcraft 3)In conclusion, it is still a great game for the ones who played the original one. It has this nostalgic effect and you enjoy every part of it.. If you didn't play the original one but curious about this one, wait for a sale, so that you don't feel like they are trying to scam you.

Unfortunately I had to return it because my 486 pc couldn't run it.  Now 18 years later,  Z arrived on Steam platform for a sale promo under $6.  I decided to take a stab once more and see what I missed in this classic.  After a few hours of gameplay,  I'm sadden to wasted my money.The AI in this game was infuriating to say the least.  I'm playing on Medium difficulty and had to retry multiple times to beat certain levels.  The computer AI cheats by have better ""luck"".  One time my lone heavy tank was dueling a lone enemy jeep and guess what?  My heavy tank's driver got sniped and the jeep came out victorious.  Another time I noticed the enemy light tanks shot twice as fast causing me to lose the battle which I shouldn't have.Pathfinding for your units was horrible.  Instead of taking shortcuts,  they prefer to take long routes to their destinations.  Frequently, they often got stuck on obstacles such as white billboards, cliffs, and buildings. Sometimes they never follow your orders.  For example,  I ordered my toughs to blow up a factory but they couldn't comprehend.  The controls were awful as well.  Everytime you issue an order,  the selected unit get deselected.  Sometimes mouse clicks don't respond.Lack of options didn't do the game any justice.  Changing the game speed and video resolution would have been nice.  Game speed felt running at a snail's pace.  The video resolution was probably defaulted at 640x480.  At the replay level on the main menu,  I can't seem to figure out how to play beyond level 5.Another problem I had were the movie cutscenes.  Not only the visuals didn't age well,  the material wasn't humorous at all.  The story didn't make much sense either.  Most of the cutscenes were played the repeated same scened just with slightly altered dialogue or terrain.  Lazy and lame!Until the developer fixes the game with future updates, it receives  a 4 out of 10."

They took original control system (where you select and command units with the same mouse button), which is very outdated, but worked well, and adjustet it (for touch screen?).For example:a) counter-intuitive scroll directionb) no context icons (because touch screen does not know you finger position?). This means you do not know in advance if you will move selected unit or select another close one.c) also due to high resolution its much easier to missclickFor example if you want to send reinforcements: you select a unit, make stupid-scroll to fight area, then click to move... insteed of moving you select fighting unit, you are forced to move it, scroll back, try again, scroll, click, wrong, move fighting unit, counter-intuitive srcoll, select, scroll, try again... In EVERY battle i played i managed to send reinforcements only after all my fighting units where dead. Not funny, not what Z is about.Besides controls the game has every improvement you could dream about for classic Z (resolution, english version available, difficulty levels, and much more). But does it matter?It will be easily the best game you ever played... in case you control your PC with some kind of touch-pad and your monitor has resolution under 640x480.

I loved Z since I first played it on the PS1 ages ago and I still love it.But this steam version is a bad port from mobile, missing a lot of functionality, still lacking multiplayer and there haven't been any updates in months. Also no word from the devs in months about wether they'll keep updating or not, but currently it looks like they abandoned it, only being interested in a cash-grab with a below average port and getting people nostalgic about this game to buy it.If the devs actually come back and fix some issues, add more functionality (I mean the audio options amount to ""music: on/off, sound: on/off"", come on...) maybe even add multiplayer and/or level editor, I'll recommend this steam version.As it stands, I would rather recommend you to find yourself an original copy of the PS1 or PC version, or look up DOSBox (or portable version of Z) or for possible multiplayer look up zodengine.Edit: The length of the game might also be of concern to some people. As it stands I have around 4-5 hours into the game and fully completed it. Of that, around one hour (maybe more) was spent idling in the menu, although I think it might not have correctly tracked my time, so maybe 1 hour was lost as well.Anyway, the game is rather short, unless you keep failing at the missions. (For some reason I beat every level on the first try, despite having quite some difficulty whenever I tried the older versions, a few years back, but maybe that's subjective).The game lacks the extra missions that the former PC version has (I think they were in that version) and as mentioned above, neither level editor, nor multiplayer. So take into account that this game might only last you 3-8 hours or something along those lines, depending on how ""good"" you are at the game."

This means if you want to click on a unit on the lower right part of the map, you have to close the minimap first.- The AI of the individual Units is different, more stupid. This is a major problem because it changes the balancing.For example in the DOS Version, a unit of snipers would stop walking and start shooting at a turret from outside of its range. In this version, the snipers will continue walking towards the tower until the tower has them in range.Also tanks will get stuck when blocked by a ""mudhut"", in the DOS Version they will shoot them out of the way, in this version they cant or wont shoot them and so they get stuck.So in this version Infantry is completely useless because it behaves so stupid. This doesnt make the game easier or harder, it just throws the game mechanics out of the window completely.Its a version of Z where basically only tanks are useful and you also have to babysit them so they dont get stuck.So since the DOS Version is freely availabe, i would not recommend to spend 7€ on this crippled version that looks like Z, butit isnt Z."

The aggressive play style you need to adopt to capture territory is the cornerstone of more recent RTS games such as dawn of war and company of heroes.

I would highly recommend to buy this one on sale. Unfortunately, the user interface and menus do not hold the same nostalgia as the old one did.Although this ""new"" version of the game sort of kills the nostalgia for me, it still delivers the game I knew back in the day. The menu went from looking like a war game to a kids game (my biggest issue so far besides multiplayer missing). The cut scenes alone in the campaign make this game worth it. The cut scenes were outrageous back in the day and were using language not known to many. Getting yelled at by Zod constantly will bring players back to watch more scenes.The actual gameplay consists of an RTS territory capture sort of game. Certain territories allow for buildings to be capture which produce either vehicles or units. Vehicles and sometimes gun turrets are by territory capture flags that definitely the player wants to get to first before the computer does. The more territory a player owns, the quicker their units build. The point of the game is to destroy the enemies fortress. These fortress themselves build units but are limited in what they can manufacture. They may add defensive turrets (gatling or rocket) to bolster defense. More manufacturing options open up as the player progresses. There are robot and vehicle type units. Some robot units include grunts, psychos (rapid weapon firing) and a sniper unit. Vehicle units range from jeeps, light tanks to heavy tanks. Some maps will have jeeps and tanks placed around certain territories. Robot units must enter these vehicles whereas a unit is manufactured to drive the vehicle at the depot. Buildings cannot be placed freely in this game!I would say buy on sale as it is an oldie and it's definitely worth the cutscenes and the gameplay (on sale may I add)!

Similar (if not identical) gameplay, same videos, sounds, music, levels, etc. Most reviews are brutally negative, and although some have good points, others are missing the target.Controls: Yes, indeed, they are weird, but I got used to them very quickly. You select units with left-clik and give orders also left-clicking. When you give an order the unit is unselected but I think the original Z did that too (but not Zod Engine). Orders can also be general, so units will automatically attack, pick up grenades, etc. Right-clicking is used for dragging and creating complex units of different soldiers, vehicles, etc, like in many RTS games you use ctrl + number. It's not true, however, that they stick together forever. If you want to select a unit inside a ""army"" right click that unit, and then you can issue normal orders just to that unit. You can also click an icon in the botton of the screen (looks like two robots) and that will eliminate the complex unit.Oh, if you want to attack the ground (to destroy a bridge, building or just shoot random animals) ctrl+left-click.Improvement: You should be able to pan with wasd or movement arrows. Also, although I don't have much of a problem with them, if you could change controls to be more like a normal RTS that would be an improvement.Zon Engine: Many people have compared this game to the free version Zod Engine. ZE is amazing, but it's a multiplayer experience and is suited for that and for people who like tinkering. Playing with map_list & default_settings you can create almost a new game with your friends, but it's not an engine for new people to Z. In fact, I still don't know how to savegame in ZE (I think you can't) and the original videos aren't there. Heck, even if you lose, you go to the next map.If you want multiplayer (and editing and tinkering) ZE is not only the best, it's the only alternative. However, if you want a single player experience similar (or identical) to the original game, this is pretty close.Other problems: (1) Language. Spanish doesn't work well. Sound is OK, but the menu is in some language I thought was italian but now I don't know if it even exists (easy- > fácil -> ¿Fécil?). Hints and descriptions seem to have been translated by a machine.(2) Better resolutions would be a welcoming improvement but I don't any problems about that and widescreen works well for me.(3) Very minor: Achievements. They are not good (build that unit, finish that level, etc.) but I guess Z doesn't have room for much improvement in that regard.(4) Editor: That would be amazing.(5) Expansion: ZE has the expansion, 11 new levels."

I've been looking all over for a fixed Z to play on Windows 7 etc. I grew up with this game so I really appreciates this! Thanks a lot! I have a few fixes/issues you may not have been able to fix yet. All units with explosive weapons aren't able to destroy those small animal houses. Instead they're trying to move next to it and gets stuck. Another issue is that sometimes when robots are trying to fight a gun especially, only one of them are shooting, the rest are just moving on the spot. Another is when you build something and you click on that building you'll have to click ""Ok"" to get that little window off. Last request/issue I can think of now is that you can't press ""Space"" to unmark a unit or check current action if there's one. You always have to target a unit or click on that little icon down the left corner to get to that action. I hope you'll look into it and find a way to fix it. At last I also have two questions.

One is just in time right back in the middle of the game. Trying hard to capture the sectors before the opponent will in order to get a little advance in production. You don't have to bother with the errection of buildings, but just have to capture those already on the map. They produce new units. They do it the faster the more sectors you own. There is nothing more satisfying than to capture an enemy sector just seconds before a new unit leaves the factory. On the other hand it's deeply frustraiting to loose a sector at that moment.

,Recommended,275530,11073313,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,Carnagath,"This is a re-release of the classic RTS Z. The game has no base building. The way you build an army is by capturing territories, which control factories, and the factories automatically produce units on a timer. There are no different races either, it's pretty much a robot army civil war. The game is known for its tense pace and high difficulty. Finishing this game back in the day was something to really brag about in the schoolyard. You need to move fast and intelligently pick which units to send where and against what. Bunching up your entire army early in the game and just going from flag to flag will lead to certain defeat, so you need to split each squad, jeep and tank and choose which territories to grab first and how to proceed from there. This makes the gameplay feel very dynamic. Each map of the campaign plays very differently as well.Things to be aware of: There is no multiplayer, only a campaign (which is however very well designed). There is no skirmish mode. It runs on Win 7 just fine. They have not reworked the resolutions, so during gameplay 60% of your screen is covered by black bars. They have added difficulty selection, which was not there in the original version. Scrolling the map feels a bit sluggish and weird sometimes. The controls are right click to select units/group up units and left click to make them move/attack (might feel a bit confusing if you are used to Blizzard controls). You cannot rebind anything.Conclusion: Z is considered a classic for a reason. It's a very tense and challenging strategy game which plays great even today. This is a reissue, not a remake, it works well on modern operating systems, but don't expect anything more. However, I think that for 5 euros it is definitely worth getting and playing through the campaign, so I will give it a thumbs up."

Also in the original Dos version of the game you could select units with the left mouse button and quicklly send them to a rally point, now its on the right button which feels just weird.

Although the AI/path finding seems to be a bit weird when trying to cross terrain with little rocks or stuff on it, most of the time they just pass over it which is intended but sometimes they refuse to move as if they are stuck in the mud.Fun game, brings back the nosalgia feelings as im guessing it was intended.7/10 worth playing but only if you can get it for say $5"

As for The Zod engine, sure it's free but I don't think it has been updated since 2011 and it doesn't have the humour that Z has. (I might be wrong about the Zod engine but I can't find any update after 2011).

There is also some input lag to deal with.Its a real time strategy game with robots and some humour.You are playing a campaign (lasts about 3 to 5 hours, depending on your gaming style) in which you gradually get more units.The units consist of different type of infantry and tanks/vehicules (size as well as function). There are no planes.Each mission starts of with a handful of units (mostly infantry) and it is your goal to get the flags of each map sector.Most of the time there is a factory (which can either produce infantry or tanks) or other building (radar, maintenance/repair) which then belongs to you.The more sectors you control, the faster your factories will produce.I bought the game for old times sake. Played it hours with my friend in ""multiplayer"" (which does not exist here) ages ago...and we are talking serial/nullmodem cable here ;)The AI is not particular challenging, its rather easy to win (or I have missed the difficulty level, which does not exist).And the game is certainly not a beauty for todays standard (was pretty sweet back then in the mid nineties), especially the whole resolution thing.There was or maybe even still is an open source remake...any remake would be great to be honest.If you are not somewhat affiliated with this game and suffer from some sort of nostalgia (like I did), I cannot recommend the game.

Forget about what the others say here as this game with or without much needed upgrades is still a blast to play.  Clearly, this version of Z is a port from iOS versions but I like what I see even though some control freedom has been taken away.  Once you understand how Z operates it's easy pickings as you play through the campaign and laugh at those cheeky cheesey comedy cutscenes.Who needs multiplayer?  Back in my day Z was fun for it's campaign not it's MP mode.  Yes, an MP mode would have been nice but it's very understandable why it's omitted here.Z is highly recommended here if you're looking for some great single player fun with some extra cheesey comedy added."

,Recommended,275530,11077635,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,BiscuitDude,"Classic Z in all it's original fast-paced territory conquering glory...though not quite.Wonky, bewildering, iOS inspired controls and interface seriously let it down. If a more robust, modern control scheme were implemented, at the very least, then I can give this a more enthusiatic recommendation.I'm fluctuating between recommending it and not. Z is one of those classic games worth experiencing. But...those controls, man. Those controls...***However! Since the recent update, Z is now more playable. Okay, so it's just an inversion of the existing control scheme, but at least it feels more familiar and not like playing twister with my fingers, being too used to modern mouse-mapping and all. Prattling aside, Z is an enjoyable game. Played it before? Play it again. Never played it? Check it out. You might just enjoy it.The overall classic gameplay is still here; fast, relentless combat and territory control requiring you to be constantly alert. The moment you switch off is when it all goes wrong. Even the music tells you so! Whether battering your foe to smithereens or suffering sustained losses, the music adjusts tone and tempo. The only other game that immediately comes to mind with contextual music cues based on how you're doing is Red Alert 3.With the arsenal balanced equally between player and enemy, it becomes more a case of skill and (in some cases) luck. Random factors can ultimatly lead to success or failure. Such as the probability of your tank shell hitting that enemy tank before he does you in. Or taking your precious Heavy Tank on a rampage against a squad of meek infantry, only for the driver to poke out and get himself nailed by that out of reach Sniper, leaving the tank free to be captured.Thinking of sending that lone Grunt against that Medium Tank? Pfft, no way! He says. It's that kind of charm and random, unpredictable gameplay elements that makes Z shine. And sometimes frustrating.Unlike most RTS games where your infantry are sworn, come hell or high water, to attack whatever target you tell them to, Z gives you the finger reminding you: soldiers can be cowards, or jackasses...even if they are robots. Sometimes the AI (no pun intended) can struggle with pathfinding, or not quite do what you want them to do. It functions more than it fails. You don't need to always tell the robots what to do, if you tell them to go to point A, they will have the good sense to attack any enemies along the way...sometimes.Singleplayer is enjoyable enough. The jokes kinda feel outdated, but I still get a grin out of the quips produced from the FMVs and in-game scenarios. General Zod, would you mind blowing that HQ up to heavy metal and a machinegun please? Thank you.If a patch for multiplayer (and/or skirmish) is added in a future update, or *shudder* DLC...then it'll greatly extend the longevitiy of this release. At the moment, I struggle to see myself playing beyond the campaign otherwise, same to any other players.From a technical aspect, the retro chip tunes, remixed slightly, unless my hearing is failing me, don't feel out of place. But some more graphics customisation options wouldn't go amiss. Higher resolutions maybe? The interface looks amateurish as well - it could do with some TLC. What was wrong with the classic interface? What works on a tablet, won't necessarily translate as well onto a desktop PC.I'm sure this classic title can only get better if the developers keep true to their word. But for now, I can enjoy Z again, and so should you!"

I see it as a pro because it's not generic in its approach and manages to do something different in a good fashion: You have to build/order units(since here your time is your resource) to occupy more buildings on the map which either can order different or more units or have another positive trait for you. The one who does it faster has an advantage. From my experience some Warhammer games have the same system, so experience its ancestor!+The Visuals still hold up in my point of few. Sure it got old but its style is coherent and presented in a funny and enjoyable way.+The mini-skits in between each mission. They range mostly from funny to hilarious and the only downside is the horribly small resolution(since they are rendered) and repetitivity(since there is only a handful of unique situations).Con:-Repititivity: Since there are only that many different units and about a handful of different planets it gets stagnant really fast, especially if you want to play through it in a couple of sittings(which is possible).-Sometimes it's just too easy, although it can be enjoyable for some to annihalate your foe.-There is always just one different player, so just 1v1.-The price! I mean sure it can be enjoyable for a couple of hours but that's no reason to charge nearly 10€ for it! Especially since the game is about 20 years old... So in the process you pay more for the achievements/trading cards... -.--It's too short, I think I played through it in about 5 or 6 hours. If they charge for it they could atleast add a couple of modes/more levels or units or mechanics.Ideas/Final statement:Either charge one € or two if you just add a DOSbox for steam with achievements or add new content. It feels like a ripoff at full price, even if it can be quite enjoyable.Although I liked it quite a bit I can't give it a thumbs up, since not everyone who likes RTS is going to enjoy this, too.Thanks for reading!"

For me personally it brings back memories!The objective of Z is to destroy your opponents Command Fort or killing all the enemy units. The Unique RTS style game is created because you build no actual buildings (you can place turrets around your zones). The game is focused on you capturing and holding zones down for unit production. The more zones, the faster each of your zone buildings will produce. Be carefull though as if the enemy capture before the unit is built they get to have it!The game is fun to play put does have some pro's and cons from the original Z and from other RTS games.Pro's:- It is a classic!- Easy game style- Mission guides for the start of each mission- Unique RTS- End game progression steps up difficulty and adds more unit types- Blowing grenade stacks up and seeing debris destroy stuff. more games need this!- Difficulty settings can be increased to make it harder- Achievements and badgesCon's:- The units seem to spread out way to much (over the original)- Some units will just stop on a wall and not move till you redirect them- Blowing bridges up and having a unit on the other side will glitch the CPU to have units on the other side of the bridge doing nothing. This also never happened in the original- Units will travel by road even when it is not the fastest or most direct route- Limited replayability- Units can be stuck in the enemy fort and not blow it up- Right click? what is this...- No unit groupings via numbers you click and drag which auto groups unitsOverall alot of the Negitives are because of the era this game was made verus the current RTS.

M = move, TAB to select next unit, Delete to remove unit from group etc.) all mouse movements are pretty much exact opposite of what comes naturally.  The ""inverse controls"" are only worse.

There's no base building instead however,  you capture territories around the map with each territory containing one of the following: Vehicle Factory, Robot factory, Radar or nothing. There's no currency, instead, units are created by time, when the countdown reaches zero, the unit appears out of the factory, the more territories that you control the less time it takes to create a unit.As the game advances you gain access to more powerful units but the more powerful ones take more time so it's a case of trying to balance your army, do you wait longer for the more powerful units or build quicker weaker units?The effects are nice with explosions going off each time a vehicle is destroyed or some of the scenery is destroyed. The vehicles are nicely animated with each unit having its own distinctive look, my favourite is the Heavy Tank.There is some comedy in the game but the game was originally made by a British company called the Bitmap Brothers (Chaos Engine) so some may not get the jokes or the humour.Now the re-release. The menu has lost its rustic charm, the original had this metal rust dashboard but now it has been replaced by a bland image and dull plain grey buttons.There used to be an announcer which would praise you or even taunt you when you were losing, that appears to now have been removed. The minimap has been replaced by a very intrusive map located in the bottom right corner which covers a large portion of the screen, mimising it down presents really really tiny minimap which is too small  to effectively use.The UI has been changed which looks like something tailored for touchscreen users, a lot of charm has been lost.Maybe one good additon is inclusion of different difficulty levels, the original may have put a lot off because some stages were quite difficult, some even lost on the very first level.If there was any other easy way of playing Z on modern systems I would not recommend this version but as it stands, if you're feeling nostalgic or just want to play a cheap great RTS then pick this up."

This is a RTS without the base building. Instead you start with a HQ and need to take the other areas with factories/Radars/land. In the beginning they are all neutral but as you conquer one side your opponent conquers the other. Soon you will be entwined in a hug with no happy ending. One huge flaw with this version of the game is the fact that to move around the map you must use your mouse against the edges. That is crazy. In the beginning it’s just slightly annoying but later on it will kill you. I’ve lost because I couldn’t look around fast enough. I can’t see what’s going on and it takes forever to get backup because of this.Another player mentioned that you can use the smaller map in the corner for fast ""traveling"" your gaze upon the battlefield. The map is small though and it does not work as well as the map in say Age of empires. The areas are not that big either so the function to use the keyboard for navigation is really something this game should have.The game has no story to talk about and the variation is in how the map looks, how much harder your enemies are and what units you can train. There is not much here but without the major map flaw I might tell nostalgic people to get it. Now I must tell you all to keep your distance.I must admit though that the nostalgia is strong with this one."

Z is a stone old game  i remember it playing it when i was 5 or 6 and i am 27 now and even back then the game was not that new back then. There is little to no story and the game can be brutal and unfogiving with not a big chanche of a comeback once you fall back but it is still a buch of fun. Matches are short and fast enough so that it don't feel to punishing when you lose and it has great variety of units, besides it is almost truly balanced since both sides have the same forces and many maps are mirrored. If you in for some old school strategy fun with hilarious cutscenes you could do far worht then spending 7 € on this game from the past"

Im hoping for frequent updates though, there is still some content missing with addional maps, multiplayer, original menus and some minor things that needs to be attended, for example the responsive mouse coursor. I will forever love this game"

76561198035675621,Recommended,275530,34955333,Posted: 14 September,all,KnightCroissant,"This game was my first RTS on the PlayStation many years ago, and I've been avoiding the Steam release after reading all the reviews about the game being a direct port from mobile, but after seeing it go on sale for less than an euro, I thought why not check out what's it like on PC (and since I needed a couple of assets from the game for my personal project). The game plays pretty much like the original, although some things should be taken into account:- It has very little in terms of content. There is only a single player campaign with 20 levels, that can be finished in a few hours- Impractical controls: Units are auto-deselected upon giving orders, and need to be manually de-grouped- Singular robots can't attack enemies- Units won't try to go around animal huts- Pyros and Lasers refuse to enter APCsI've also tried the open-source remake Zod Engine, but to me it felt very different from the original game, and also had some glitches and balancing errors, not to mention the lack of proper menus and cutscenes, plus I don't think it's being updated anymore."
,Recommended,275530,35104566,Posted: 21 September,all,The4thDuke,"First released for DOS in 1996, Z was praised for its strategy, not as complex as other games, but let's not forget it was released years before ""Age of Empires"" and just one year after Windows 95 release. I am a proud owner of the DOS version and it's a game that has always been sitting in all my PCs, recently for DosBox. The graphic is quite decent for a Dos game (and I am glad they didn't update it), the game is simple but doesn't mean easy, it doesn't give you the ability to build buildings, you must get the work done with what the map offers (and it often helps the enemy), but that's exactly what I liked of this game, spot the best factories in the map, make sure to defend them with what you got, then build what you need, greed can help the enemy. While I still suggest this game (as it's one of my favourite, thanks to my childhood too), there are some conditions about it, unfortunately the ofiginal DOS/Win95 version is much better, let's check out why.PROSSIMPLE DOESN'T MEAN EASY: The game is extremely simple: 6 types of robots, 6 vehicles (+1 for repairs), 4 turrets,  resources beside granades shattered around the map, no ability to build. You must destroy the enemy or get inside the enemy castle, while conquering the territories by ""touching"" a flag. While it features a basic concept, the game is not as easy as it sems, because the landscape will make the difference. You must be careful about probable obstacles like rock walls, water and bridges, make sure you conquer the right territories for the best factories. The factories are very limited but not so easy to use, while some factories can build better robots and vehicles, they will require more time, and time is everything, especially when you realize a big army is approaching to your not so well defended factory to claim the land and ""steal"" your creation. Yes, if an army claim the land with a factory in it almost done manfacturing, it will be stolen. You can keep the factory for the entire time, if the enemy claim the land for a few seconds when the manfacturing is done, the heavy tank you built will turn enemy and destroy all your plans. Very easy but not simple. You can set traps like damaging bridges with enemies on it to destroy them all, set turrets in very well defended places, the basic concept of the game doesn't give too much limitation on tactics.FUN FROM 1996: I am writing this review in 2017, which makes the game 21 years old, probably older than most of steam users. What's important to understand is that this game was made a long time ago, before strategy games became popular by the end of the decade. The game is old and simple, yet it could give you some fun and hard time strategy despite being ""obsolete"". Let's face it, it was a funny game back then and it's still fun 21 years later, while I can enjoy building barracks with different armies in other games, none of them give me the thrill to conquer a flag to claim a factory, select my best functional robots and wait for the timer to get to zero.MAPS: I have to admit I never fully completed the game until now (got stuck at about level 16 out of 20), the maps have an easy design, but some were true fun. I enjoyed their shapes despite making it harder for my army, some have particular geometry shapes like a divided square, others features the HQs almost facing each other but divided by a river, some have roken bridges making the other half accessible by the sides, one even has two big twin parking lots plenty of vehicles and the first army reaching them definitely win the game. Maps were fun, even when too hard, I enjoyed all their shapes and concepts.QUICK BATTLES: Forget AoE and other games, Z features quick battles spanning from 5 to 40 minutes, it could be a matter of critics but making them not too long can be fun too, it's just a different concept for a game. Most of your strategy will be played at the heat of the battle (and you need some luck too), if your tactic wins, your job to manfacture your army for the final assault will be a lot easier. This is a nice strategy for the game, unfortunately there aren't enough maps and even the expantion maps are missing.DISCOUNTED: While I do critic the high price, I want to praise how often this game was discounted on Steam, you can easily buy it for less than 1$, but I would recommend the pack with its successor for about 1,50$. Unless you really love thisgame, buy it discounted, will be worth the price.CONSPORTING: As I said, I am a Z player from DOS disk, this version is a bad porting from the android/ios version and does nothing to hide it. That's a shame, not worth its base price because had no care of some very important details that should never exist in a PC game, like the big X button up in a corner to skip the cutscene. I would have praised the porting if it came from the PC version, unfortunately I can understand why it has so many negative reviews due to its wrong porting and I can't hide it, it deserves them. I give it a positive because it's still playable after all.COMMANDS: One of the consequences of the bad porting is its awful commands. I already mentioned the big X on cutscenes, I will mention how the drag and select doesn't always work fine, how I couldn't deselect my army with the mouse (often giving them orders to move to the other side of the map), even the menu has problems. The worst I experienced was the esc key to jump to menu, if you press it again it will ask if you want to leave the game, once it even asked me if I wanted to play the map instead of jumping to menu, making me lose a couple battles. Awful porting, enough said.DIFFICULTY: Difficulty is a bit a matter of critics. I recall it was very hard on DOS, here looked the same but I could finish all levels in just 2 days, I don't understand why. Focusing inside the game, a negative critics is about the ""all in"" strategy, you will win or lose the game by just one move, because of its quick battles. It's all about one tactic at the moment you confront the other army or fight for a land claiming, sometimes it's just too simple on that, but still, beating the enemy is not as easy as it may seems. A positive note, difficulty can be changed, I played it at normal.LANGUAGES: My DOS version was english only, this steam version has my language too (Italian), so I decided to try it out. While the audio is good but repetitive, the translated text is terrible, there isn't a screen of the game with a correct translation, sometimes making it even harder to understand. Just a tip to developers, if you want to make a game with different languages, make sure you hire someone with knowledge. Don't use Google translator or mid school children, don't do it.PRICES: I keep saying, I agree with selling old games again for a not so low price, but they must feature something new and different to explain the price. While I praise it's compatibility with modern systems, the game has nothing new, actually what was good in the old version is quite broken in this one. The game is a crude porting with no optimizations for PC, commands are broken, translations are bad, why should I spend so much for a broken game I already own, still working (better) with DosBox and even available as opensource? Money should be earned for that price, or make the price a lot lower. Luckly it's often discounted below a dollar.Final word: An old and funny game with particular simple strategies, featuring more problems than the original Dos release. it's mostly suggested because it's still playable and often discounted in the store, it will give you some hours of fun and make you miss the manfacturing timers and the flag battles, if you don't mind"
