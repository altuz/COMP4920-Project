I played the PC console-port of this game and liked it, for the most part.  Keep in mind the graphics are dated, and the engine is dated, but it's still fun to play.  I remember running into some graphical glitches and some quest glitches that were annoying, but didn't ruin the game for me.  I'm a fan of the Volition games like Freespace 1 and 2 and this game was a fun departure from that game style.  That said, I really, really, really hope Freespace 1 and 2 come to Steam!  Summoner is a good console game port and is a fun game.  I remember the summoning being extremely compelling and it kept me playing all those years ago.  I'm looking forward to playing it again!"

If you're a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ look somewhere else, and be aware that it needs a simple (less than 5 minutes) fix to run correctly on modern machines.  It has its imperfections but they're heavily outweighed by fun combat that you still have to think about, meaningful skill points, and the basic fun of summoning everything from a floating sword to the incarnation of death to help you in fights.A quick rundown of the negatives: Has what one might call ""old game syndrome"" (no auto saves, quests rely on a walkthrough or you being persistant, such as finding an item in a town and you're not given any clue as to where it is, enemies can really spike in difficulty, and other things that games have more or less grown out of) story is a bit predictable at times, some parts of the game drag on for a long time while others you just walk in walk out, if you put skill points into the wrong skills you're at a decent disadvantage, possibly completely screwed if you decided that you would max all wrong skills first, the game's a bit easy, especially if you know or find some of the more exploitative mechanics, the AI is more than a bit dodgy at times, and the voice actor of the main character is honestly so-soThe positives: Loot system as well as exploration feels rewarding, varied gameplay, while there may be a functional best build there is far from only one build to make your characters strong, very nice aesthetics to the game, combat is fun, I only felt it to be grind-y when I was literally grinding to catch up on a few skills before I hit a big boss, you level up frequently enough that you feel like you're constantly improving and if you decide you really need a skill you can get the points fast enough, good plot that has a number of twists, bosses (and a number of regular enemies) are challenging without needing 20 tries to defeat, the summons are very fun to use and can make hard areas easy, and the side quests can also be extremely rewarding"

I never thought about replaying the game because I remember how long it took me to finish it as I like to explore a lot and to take everysingle stuff.The storyline is great, my overall score for the game would be 10/10.

While it is currently debated among some friends, I still think Summoner is the inspiration for Skyrims tale. You are born with a mark that allows you to summon, but not until you get proper training, even the king without an heir (his 4 sons died under strange circumstances, and one idiot move), While some argue this is a storyline of many games and movies, I feel this one is very close to how Skyrim is writtenThe world appears gigantic, however downside, is there are not enough NPC's to make up for the space. So it feels empty in these otherwise large towns, cities and buildings.Music is modern - odd choice, you would expect something celtic - but it works - at least for me.Graphicly, it is the style of the old Gothic RPG, maybe a little less, but the story is amazing and the mechanics are great. The casting of spells have nice animation, and I was pleased to see that most of the A.I. on your team works well. Sometimes you have to make sure they are attacking the right mob, but for the most part they know where to go.There has been a massive complain that the game runs to fast on modern systems, so with that, I'll post here in this review how to fix that - For $5 its a good buy! Get it.---- ---------------------------------------------------------------- SLOW DOWN FIX FOR SUMMONER---- Tested with Win 7 64bit QUAD Core..-----------------------------------------------------------------Win7 64bit QUAD Core - Here is a fix I used. Work very niceIf you have tinkered with the V-Sync then you already know thatt is a hit and miss (system dependent)Changing the Afinnity will not work either, as these games are made to run on single core (sometimes dual core), and will not recognize anything other than that. So using more cores is impossibleHere is a successful option, that works on many games (and some DOS games as well).I know it works in win7, if you have another OS and can follow this method - please confirm.CREATE A NEW POWER MANAGEMENTGo to control panel: In the search box (upper right) type POWER then click ""Choose a power plan""A new split view will open.Select ""Create a New Power Plan"" (left side panel)Select High PerformanceAnd name it something like ""Old Games""NextChange both settings in the next view to NEVERClick ""Create""Now you will see your new power setting (now selected). Click on ""Change plan settings""You'll now have a link that says ""Change advanced Power settings""Scroll down to ""Processor Power Management""Change the Minimum Processor State to 1% (YES ONE PERCENT)Change the Maximum Processor State to 1% (SAME)Save it, your done.NO YOUR COMPUTER WILL NOT RUN AT 1% but it will force it to use the lowest possible processor state as most games are run by state of the processor.Which this will likely be somewhere between 500-800mhz.during play there were a few (very rare) minor speed glitches, but they lasted a fraction of a second.. sorta like a hiccup. But it plays nice.Again, this works on my W7 64bit, Quad Core... results may vary on other systems.Hope this helped at least ONE person so that they may enjoy this classic!!"

The PC port works fine and I suspect will run on fairly low end rigs. The Graphics are a little muddy looking in places but Summoner's not really the kind of game I play for good visuals. Bottom line is -If your up for a decent RPG experience with slightly dated visuals then for the price you can't really go wrong. Summoner is one of those games you can sink heaps of time into and still only scratch the surface.Recommended to any fan of old style RPGS!"

76561198040639055,Recommended,275570,18899062,"Posted: 5 November, 2015",all,OneWayTr!P,"This is one of my teenage favorite games. I must have sunk 1000+ hours into it back on my PS2. It was one of the games that was released with PS2 and I got it the same day I got my PS2 ((And I picked up The Bouncer that day as well)). So much content for an older game. The depth in the story and ability to control your own fate with your actions.Many of times have I lost track of the days (and missed school) because of this title. I still have one of my original playthroughs with over 700 hours just on that one file on my PS2 memory card ((remember those)).If you are looking for a game that has more story then a game of its time would be expected of, alot of side quests, good loot system, tons of ways to customize you're character and you're party to whatever playstyle and class build that you want you're group to consist of, and a storyline that will have you pulling out you're teeth for more. With a good ammount of replay value. And different endings. Then this is a game you should take the time to try.Its alot cheaper then what I paid for it originally. So if you buy it and dont like it ((to each their own)) you lost out on what would be a pack of cigarettes or can of monster/redbull.This is just a great game with what was a newer combat system ((unless you played StarOcean)) for its time. I also own the second Summoner title for PS2 as well But insted of summoning you became the summoned creature. And it is not a continued story. So this one as well as the second title kind of have there own standalone style of gameplay and story.In this one you can summon monster to battle with you rather then becoming the summon. ((I personally liked the first one more then the second title)). Beat them both multible times. And would do so again. I hope you get as much enjoyment out of it as I do."

It was made for both the ps2 and the PC. Made by violition and THQ it had small but decent studio's working on it. The story was really what made this game what it was beecause it sure as hell wasn't the graphics. The game has an amazing story and rich lore. The combat is turn based on the level of dragon age origions but with four different companions to switch around at max it gives you plenty to think about before your turn is even up. The four companions all have rich stories as well. Graphics are smeh at best, remember this was a ps2/old PC game and so it didn't have the best graphics. Sound is usually good, the music on all the different levels and world random encounters you have is amazing and it really gets you into the game. All in all I would give this a 9/10.Remember your definitely not playing this game for the graphics."
,Recommended,275570,12865389,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,RICE,"**Fair warning, this game was developed with the PS2 in mind, the PC version doesn't control as well and sometimes camera panning doesn't work. Same with a few nonconsequential interactions. Also there is, to my knowlege, no way to enable gamepad support.The story of this game revolves around a young boy named Joseph, who was born with the mark of the summoner. When raiders descended upon his childhood village, he summoned a beast from his ring to fight off the invaders, but he was too weak to control it, so it slaughtered everyone except for those who could escape. Out of his disgust of his power and his inability to control it, he threw the ring down a well and exiled himself, only to have a foreign military attack his new village in search of him, thus leading him on a quest to find his old mentor and reluctantly get involved in the world's events.The combat consists of left clicking on a target, and waiting a bit. You could cast a spell then open a menu to cancel the spell's start up if you want more hands on, or you can manually chain your attacks as well, tho there's little reason to until you get to a certain point.The party you get is only 4 members plus one summon. The members you get are just a standard main-hero jack of trades, a rouge, a spell caster, and a warrior-- Pretty standard. But how the game handles summons is more interesting. Only the main character can Summon, and he has to wear a ring to do so (thus giving up a slot for bonus stats). Also if he gets downed after summoning, the summon goes rogue and you must kill it before you can summon again without leaving the area, but beyond that, summons are permanent until you reach a new area, it dies, or you banish it. Beyond that, you can jump in between control of your characters and even move them around individually (which is required for a few parts of the game), though beyond that, there is not much else.The lore is the strongest part of this game, where every NPC has something to say, either it be some snippet about their daily life or how the nations are interacting with each other. There is even a whole religion you can learn about and you can find how skeptical other people may be of it. There's not a whole lot I can say without spoilers or just saying things, just if you like talking to NPCs, there is certainly a lot to be found here.For voice quality, this IS an early 2000 game. The voice acting is okay, but there are repeated lines and sound effects galore. Like every time Joseph levels up, he says ""I grow more powerful."" in the most dead-panned way, and there are only so many times you can hear the same grunt sound over and over. I have a tolerance to these kind of things, so I wasn't bothered too much, others may be though.The music in this game is overall down to preference. It has a very 2000s feel to it, but the soundtrack services this game just fine, although the first city's theme may wear thin after a while because it's constantly retarting from going between area and area a lot, and also you may be there for a few hours if you side-quest, and being stuck in large areas just has the songs drone on. However, the game does have individual sound sliders, so you can just mute the music and play your own.Back in the day, Summoner was an unrecognized game that was very good for what it had. It's still true today, but how the game aged may turn some people off from it. This is a game that doesn't push any boundaries by any modern means. However, it is still worth checking out if you enjoy stories."
,Recommended,275570,13201972,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,Sasoribi,"[WARNING: NOSTALGIA INTENSIFIES]I was about ten years old when my father bought a gaming magazine. It was rare for him to buy these things, moreso to actually read through them or even install something from the cd. But when I came home from school one of these days, there he was, telling me that he installed this awesome demo where you could walk in the city and there were even rats and shopkeepers and stuff. So I tried it, and I was eternally captured. Was it the design or the great and original music? I kept replaying the demo over and over again. Months went by, it was december, and we stumbled upon the full version in a supermarket. I will never forget the shade of that green box. My parents told me we couldn't afford it and I understood that, but I cried like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ when I got it for Christmas. Still got the original cds, but the beautiful green box is lost because I kept carrying it everywhere with me like a retard. I will be thinking of this game on my deathbed.[END OF NOSTALGIA]Game settings, loreSummoner is a dark fantasy RPG with an amazing lore. The story itself is extraordinary, but all the cities and mountains and forests are filled with little stories that actually hold together and give the world a subtle, enchanting atmosphere: Masad, a burnt down village where the game begins. Lenele, City of Gods, where people fear the upcoming war and where strange noises come out of the sewers. Iona, a secluded monastery built on the carcass of a gigantic god whose body turned into deep catacombs. Khosani kingdom hidden in the mountain; Tower of Eleh, built to reach the sky. You visit all these and many more locations, none of which are empty or dead, as some Summoner reviews on the web say.Balance issuesThe game is built around singleplayer experience and as such, it doesn't focus on balance. You may notice these little balance twitches after few playthroughs: e.g. most enemies are resistant against sword attacks. And who the hell would level up anything but sword mastery? If you don't know this, you may have a hard time, especially when facing some bosses and during the Tower of Eleh solo run.The combat system, skillsThe combat system is the only thing I was always unsure about: you click an enemy, you start attacking him. No adrenaline rush. During your attack, you have a chance to prove your professional gaming skill and chain into more attacks by pressing RMB when a chain symbol appears over your head (it gets progressively harder). You can let the game chain the attacks for you by ticking an option in the game settings (don't ask me). Aside from autoattacking an enemy to death, you can cast a decent amount of spells - if that is what you want your character to learn, because it's impossible to learn all the skills on one hero. Summoner is not about plain skill, it's about planning your characters and employing some tactics in a wider perspective. The game is SLOW PACED. Especially if you summon the stone golem (DON'T EVER SUMMON THAT FAT ♥♥♥♥, YOU WILL LOSE FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE FOR NOTHING).Objectively, Summoner hasn't aged well. It could use texture updates or voice acting and some technical tweaks (resolution, running on fast rigs etc). Just watch some gameplay videos and try it out for yourself, if you feel like it.I will always love this game and all the people that worked on it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnwlw5r_zDU"

Nothing exceptionally complex but this is a real RPG from back when they actually made games like this.  No food, drink, and sleep requirements but this game has lots of quests, huge maps, full inventory and equipment mechanics, and working character leveling mechanics.  Also note that this game is huge and long just like they made RPGS back in that era.  Easy to reach the hundred hours or more if you take your time and enjoy the game instead of just rushing through to win the game.

And despite being pretty dull, repetitive, graphically ugly (it was even back then), and raw it still has stayed on my mind all these years. There's a certain charm in this game. The first city stays on your mind forever.Combat is pretty clunky, relying on timed button pressing to get chains, you can pump out chain attacks as much as you got AP. That's pretty op in the end stages. You get a party of 4 chars, and one slot reserved for your summon. so, 5 slotted party :D I never really found much use for the summons actually, and i haven't grinded my characters especially either. So the game is pretty easy on the combat-aspect. If you're looking for tactical challenge, it's not this game.The lore is big on this game, that is really the most crafted part of this game, and a big thing that got me into this game. It's interesting, there's a lot of lore you might miss if you don't explore the game. The locations are also intrestingly crafted, the cities feel like cities. There's one dungeon that felt too boring, but otherwise the swamp palace felt logical. Not too big, not too small, something that wuold be built in the real world also.I wuold like to see this game remade, there's a lot of potential for epic fantasy moments/locations, the island monastery, the giant waterfalls at lenele, the Urath temple.There's a lot of flaws in this game, nothing game-breaking but annoyances like bad camera movement, clunky combat, sometimes it's really repetitive when enemies spawn when going back to other floors. underneath it all, it's a solid sotry, unique world and that strange, raw charm that somehow gets you interested, and eventually thinking about this game from time to time.

You get to summon quite a vast array of different minions to fight along side you, like a hulking minotaur or a spell flinging imp depending on your preference.It's very surprising how catchy the music gets at points where it starts out atmospheric then suddenly goes nuts with some very fitting tune.  The game is a party based rpg where you can pause any time to issue orders like Baldurs gate.  I feel that this sort of gameplay fits pc's much better then a console controller would.

I had it when it first came out and i was very young and did not quite understand how it worked but i used to watch my sister play. it has recently be re-released on steam and i decided to give it a try and for a price tag of 4.99$ why not?The story is about a man named the joseph born with the mark of the summoner, Through the use of magical rings, Summoners have the power to call forth demons and control them .However, to the north in Orenia is the Emperor Murod, a powerful sorcerer who wants Joseph dead.  With his unworldly powers, Murodlaunches a campaign whose sole purpose is to find Joseph.  When Murod'sforces reach Joseph's home of Masad our story begins.The gameplay is similar to dragon age and other tactical/turn based games, u can pause time mid comabt and  que your teams actions then unpause, so u have more control over whats happening when rather then panicin tryin to control upto 5 character in the middle of live combat. Also the game is very challengin by having to read dialogue rather then look for a flashing icon on your map of where to go and exactly what to do. no mini map icons makes u remember where certain shops and nps were.There is voice acting for all cutscenes and the graphics are still barable for being 14 years old. the music is very good as it captures the dark time perfectly.i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes dragon age and other tactical rpgs, if you can bare the dated graphics the great story, rpg elements, and music will provide you for a very enjoyable experience"

The graphics are a bit old and you need to get used to it at the start but i didnt mind much. I wanted to learn more about the story so i read every text and explored everything the game had to offer, i found collecting all the armour/summons (highly recomend a guide for that) and doing all the side quests quite satisfying, if you do that you have a good 35-40 hours on it which is quite good for the price.There are 2 things i dont like about this game. The first is that you got 2 big continents which only have a few area's where you can actually do stuff like towns or dungeons. I found myself wandering around the world for quite some time while finding no spots at all that actually have content. The first continent has 5 spots you can go to (Towns and dungeons) but there is room for alteast 20 (not kidding) and stil have enough open world left.The thing probably is that there was no money left to fill in the hole's which is a shame, could have been more.The second one is that every time you get a cut scene (which is mostly before a boss fight) the game speed increases twice as much then before, not only is this verry annoying some boss fights are already really tough to manage without this bugg, with it you get yourself in situations that your a few seconds in a Boss fight and you see one friendly party member already on 10% HP.The trick for this bug is to save the game and then load (doesnt work much in a boss fight) or everytime the game needs to load when you go to a different area it usually gets back to normal.Anyway had a lot of fun with this game, i would give it a 7/10. Reason for this is all the things i said before and because they put alot of effort in the game with trying to make it feel like a epic journey, which worked out."

Now, the Emperor of the continent Orenia has invaded Masad village, his new home, looking for a young man with a strange mark on his hand - Identical to young Joseph's. Now, he must find out why the Emperor wants him so badly...I first played Summoner in 2013, when I got it at a garage sale for my PS2. The title was enough to draw my attention, so I bought it and tried it out ASAP. The background of the protagonist, Joseph, is a sad one. The opening cinematic, after giving a bit of backstory, transitions into gameplay, and starts you off with a tutorial, which involves killing some of the afore-mentioned Orenians, referenced in-game as ""Rennies."" The controls are hard to get used to, as movement is controlled by mouse, but entirely possible to get used to. The lore of the world is a bit patchy in places, but there's enough there to give you a sense of the world's history. And then, there are the characters. Each of the four main characters has their own unique backstory (and I got deep into theorizing about one of them), meaning they all have their own specialized skill sets. Finally, for a game of its era, it's actually MASSIVE. Not quite Elder Scrolls massive, but still ♥♥♥♥ing HUGE. The navigation is a bit disappointing, however, as whenever you leave certain areas, such as Masad village or the Lenele Outskirts, it places you in the World Map. Traveling around the map, you have a chance to be placed in an Encounter, where you are pitted against rather powerful enemies, depending on your skills and inventory.The navigation is also disappointing because of how huge the continent you start on (Medeva) actually is. If Summoner had been made by Bethesda, Medeva and Orenia would each be the size of the Daggerfall map (approximately the size of Great Britain).All in all, Summoner is a great game and, in my opinion, a worthwhile purchase. I give it 10 p.i.s.s.e.d off Fire Imps out of 10."

Only way i know how to describe it. You point the person you want to stab and then you wait for your person to hopefully outstab the enemy. Also the GUI makes it difficult to click on the enemy in the first place, so you will often get hit before you can hit back.Camera and movement are also a very large problem, you move by using your mouse to point on the ground where you want to go. This would normally be fine, but the camera just does not give you the option to path your characters movement more than a few steps. Be ready to have to halt your movement so you can move the camera to see where you are going and then go on your merry way again for a few steps before rinsing and repeating.Quest tracking is terrible. Just.............terrible. Each quest is logged just fine. They even give you a little description of who you got the quest from and where you can find them. However, as you advance some quests, you get new information. Better have a pen handy, because any additional information will NOT be finding its way into the quest descriptions. Also half the quests have you hunting down people in the HUGE city hub (which has over 4 chunks to trudge endlessly through). Again, pen and paper so you remember the locations of all the people of interst.The map is also just awful. You can pull up your map and it will show you where you are and a little around you. Thats it. You cant zoom out, so you only get a little chunk right around where you are standing. Not only that, but the map lists absolutely NOTHING on it. Its just a graphic of the enviroment around you. No merchant locations, no points of interest, just nothing.Bottom line here is that it is a dated game that makes me so unbelievably greatful for the wonderful maps, quest tracking, camera etc of modern gaming. I like to believe that games were never this bad, but then again maybe we just live in spoiled times today. I can see no reason anyone would want this game, it just has nothing to offer."

You could kill enemies in a random encounter and get 10x the reward plus save half the time.The thing that gets me the most is the shopping and buying equipment.....You can wear two pieces of chainmail for about 30k and it will give you the same protection as a 300-800k suit of armor.The game has almost every aspect of a first generation game rushed out to a new console, with little planning and foresight....with massive padding so they could claim X hours of gameplay.It has very few redeeming qualities (I actually like the chaining system).

But, as can be expected from such a selection, it's kind of a crapshoot as to whether or not the game will be any good.In this case, not so much. While I didn't play enough to put much judgement on the plot, the controls are simply a mess. The game plays a bit like Runescape classic, where you move by clicking on your intended destination, and combat consists of clicking on an enemy and waiting to see who falls down first. Dull, but servicable and open to improvement as the game progresses. Honestly, the thing that really killed my interest was the camera, which only moves - slowly - by holding your mouse to the edge of the screen and waiting as it rotates. When the game is as willing to make you wander around tangled back alleys as this, this makes simple exploration an irritating chore.That, along with the complete lack of waypoints in large, visually undistinctive city maps, was what made me quit an hour in instead of continuing to slowly wander around trying to find which of the 270 nondescript NPCs sold armor I can actually wear, let alone trying to find the actual direction of the plot when the opening level was so obtuse I managed to kill every single enemy on the wide-open map before finally tripping over the exit.Maybe people more used to this genre of game might get more mileage out of Summoner, but me I just found it too tedious to keep going."

It was the time during which possesing a GeForce 3 Ti 200 was my joy and pride :) and I still got that GPU in my drawer! =]But going back to the game itself. Why would I recommend it?Because it is simply one of the best RPG games that was ever released to the market. It has a couple of great features that elevate it above many other competitors from those times and even the present ones.I personally would start with the music, because it is a very good collection of well performed tunes.After that comes of'course the huge open world of Medeva and Orenia, with many quests, side quests, puzzles, fantastic stories to hear and treasures to find. Many plot twists make the game very enjoyable and story feels much like a good movie. Full and complete gameplay took me more than 100 hours at first time and about 70 hours at the following ones. I finished that game several times and each of them I was very satisfied with final credits. Total time I spent in the world of Summoner could probably reach some 600 hours.Advancement of the characters of which we have 4 in a team + 1 summon, is done by a unique author design.We can choose from a wide variety of weapons and armors of which every single one has their own looks and characteristics. We can choose between real time gameplay or active pause that greatly helps in any kind of engagement. Each character has his or her own story to tell, their own opinions, ideas and quests to help them with.If I were to compare this game to something else that would be on par, in terms of quality those would be probably: Star Wars Kotor, 1st Mass Effect, Gothic series and Neverwinter Nights. It is almost as good as the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series but the look on game screen is different. Summoner is a third person, BG and IWD were isometric games.In my personal RPG hall of fame this game holds the TOP 10 with a good position among that group and I am not a person who has not experienced also the very old RPG games from the 1990s :) which were the greatest achievement for the mentioned genre of games.To sum up, for such a low price, it is a must for every open minded role play gamer."

Some of the elements of this game show their age as you would expect but a game of this size and scope is definatly worth the miniscule price.

You may find you have trouble getting it to start with newer graphics cards, it seems to be a common problem, By searching in the steam online forums you will find many other people having this trouble.. I found that getting a graphics card emulator worked to get me started and depending on which thread within Steams website you go to you might find a handy link to a good one. I would have provided it here but I've already left the page and I'm a very lazy man :) Once you DO get the emulator it's a simple matter of installing it and then BAM it'll work. Your max resolution will be 800 x 600 but I am told that there are additional 3rd party patches that can assist with getting higher resolutions. So don't despair! Again, great game. Give it a go!

,Recommended,275570,15215299,"Posted: 5 April, 2015",all,Sgt Poultry,"There are some major flaws with the design but if you enjoy older hack and slash rpgs this can be fun gem. Combat is mostly back and forth timed attacks with you cast/using abilities similar to Neverwinter Nights or Baldur's Gate except that there is one ""chain"" mechanic that lets you do special bonus attacks if you right click exactly when the blow lands. The mechanic is surprisingly deep as you gain new bonus attacks each different party member gets different ones (though some are shared). Characters are built via skill points which you pump into things like ""fire"" for fire magic or ""sword"" to up hit chance for sword weapons, each person gets predetermined skill sets which appear as they level so while there is some customization it is limited. The major draw here is the ability of the main character to summon one monster party member which is as cool as it sounds, really I wish I could just ditch the 3 other npcs and go full monster party. All the summonable monsters are unique with different traits and skills you can switch them out depending upon what kind of enemies you face. One flaw with the monster summons is no ability to set their AI.This game does have its share or problems: no mini map notes, large empty areas, no fast travel, poor AI, respawning enemies, linear story. The combat can be fun but all the tedious traveling and looking for merchants or quest npcs or having a side quest completely disappear because you advanced the main story without any indication before hand leads to lots of fustraition. Additionally because of the enemies respawning its very annoying getting from point A to point B on top of which you cannot leave non-random encounter zones while under attack and with your party members all nearby. The game also starts slow with you lacking your ""Summoner"" skill till a hour or so in but if can handle the flaws you'll find a game worth playing."
