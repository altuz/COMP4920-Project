As long as you go into this game expecting not much all of your expectations will be met.  The forced camera angles will give you a headache; the poor transitioning from console to PC will grind your gears; and the story is laughably... well the story is more of a narration, which is to say a disembodied voice will tell you to go ""here"", or go ""there"", and destroy ""thing"".  $9.99 is a bit much of an asking price imo.  This is more suited for $4.99, and below, venues."

I have a video for it for those who perfer watching instead of reading:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxR2iKxoUDQ&feature=youtu.bePros:You can pick your chapter marines (select few).4 classes with customizable weapons and perks.Powerups and grenade.Survival mode.Fully voiced codex entries.Unlockable collectibles.Local Co-op (2 player).Drop in Co-op.Cons:Repetitive, no variety, there are no weapon pickups in a level.Performs badly (60fps is easy but tanks with v-sync off between 70 to 220fps).Can't access graphics options in the middle of a game.Low resolution textures (although there is nice detail in the environments).No easy Drop Out co-op.No online multiplayer.Camera is bad, it can bug out and get stuck or be at bad angle transitions causing enemies to hit you from off-screen.No steam trading cards (minor but I feel I should mention it).Little warhammer implementation, seems like another game with a warhammer skin slapped on it at the last minute.Heavily re-used assets within the game and many assets used from other warhammer games under the THQ name (this game was originally on console under THQ in 2011)I will continue playing and my perspective of the game might change a bit but with the gameplay being so boring it won't make much of an impact. Until then buy Renegade Ops or Halo: Spartan Assault instead. Wait for a sale if you REALLY like warhammer and twin stick shooters.This game is a disgrace to the emperor!"

Kill Team still has problems but serious problems seem fixed after update.(Likes cam angle bug, bad mouse sensitive, etc.)I'm glad watch Nomad Games has intention to modify and I hope they fix co-op problem too.Update makes me feeling better, meanwhile, it means Nomad Games sold beta version of product to full price when I think about it. It's another nasty things.So I still recomand you wait buying and watch the development of 40k: Kill Team.------------------------------------------When I saw Kill Team on steam, I'm really happy. I'm big fan of Warhammer 40k, I have 5000pts(Maybe 6k) Imperial Guard army, playing warhammer fantasy too, have lot of Warhammer game(most of them... you know, shity game), Novels...

Well... strictly say... better than SoV....Local Co-op? Bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ It doesn't support co-op! It dosen't work! It doesn't! To start Co-op, you need press start button of 2p but in game you can only control 1p. Game option doesn't suport 2p key! Ofcourse, no invite friend option too! You can't invite your friend, both online and offline.Bad optimization is another problem. In game, we control shooting angle by mouse, but can't modify mouse sensitive. Doesn't support wide screen, screen easily change wide to full to wide to full to wide by vaccine or whatever, and steam option cover game screen when press splint button. Game hint doesn't change. For example, It told me 'press LR to use Special Move'. What??? What is LR?? What am I supposed to do???

You feel less like a kill team and more like a patient at a doctors office, everything is a waiting game.  Everytime you enter a section the game stops and spends 10-15 seconds showing you the area there is no way to skip this.  Everytime you die at some parts and restart your faced with another wait period while it explains the same thing again.  Even starting  new game has a waiting period of 10 secs for no reason.  This game is more like heresy that will drive any player to the point of chaos as the ruinous powers of the warp tear their mind apart at how tedious and boring this game is.  Could have been a great arcadey shooter if it didnt stop the play ever minute or every area for some panoramic camera showoff of the area.

Now I know.The technical glitches are mentioned enough in other reviews and honestly I can forgive the camera being stuck in one level, the intro video showing green artifacts and so on, if they were the only flaw in the game.Even when the camera works (that is most of the time) the view is often obscured by objects in the foreground. It is plainly annoying to have to play were is Waldo ever so often to find my character inside the scenery. And having a panning camera in a twin stick shooter game is a plain bad Idea. Especially if it’s two players. I remember seeing more space marines drop to their untimely death because of camera movement, than falling to the enemy.Speaking of which: the combat while initially fun is utterly unbalanced. If you want a cheap victory, go for the rocket launcher. This of course leads the scoring system in the two player campaign ad absurdum.So if you do not expect much but a mediocre twin stick shooter in the 40k setting, go for it. If you want a good game, I am afraid you will not find it here."
,Recommended,275610,32769185,Posted: 25 June,all,Termenus7814,"KillTeam will offer experience of Space Marines as godlike warriors. You will navigatate straightforward levels and kill absolutely everything. There are several classes and several weapon and perk options to choose from. Once you beat the game with one class you will have unlocked more powerful weapons for other classes also.Game is split into five huge levels, and you need about three hours to beat them all. There are a lot of power ups, which you should use without too much thinking, they make the game easier.In this game you will do one thing and one thing only: KILL XENOS!There are a lot of enemies, but only you have a faith in the Emperor! Kill them all. With bolter, sword and grenades, kill them all.KillTeam serves experience of systematically slaying xenos perfectly. There is no grand story or plot, you just go and kill. Perfect for people who do not have a lot of time. Once you start a level, you must finish it, because there is no save game, there is very balanced checkpoint system instead.Game is very fun if you look at it as platform shooter, and be aware that this is port.Camera glitch can happen sometimes, where your camera gets stuck, but is very rare, happening maybe once in three hours.

So beware of that.- Out of 4 Classes, 2 are virtually useless because being a melee class just ends up getting you killed extremely fast.- Minor bothers like asset re-using from other Dawn of War games.However, basically this would be a competent and fun twin-stick shooter but two things kill this game entirely. Glitches and the worst camera of gaming. Seriously, the camera is pure sin. I had to restart so many times because the camera decided it doesn't want to follow me anymore, and even when it works it tends to be in really bad spots.And the most notable glitch I experienced was with moving platforms, aka elevators. I don't know what was wrong but my Marine and enemies would glitch through or get bounced off from it, falling to my death.Tl;dr---------I had to start the third Mission like 14 times because I died in the cutscene to the elevator. I died in the cutscene. Don't buy this broken piece of Warhammer blasphemy. Go buy Space Marine instead.EDIT: As a sidenote: I played alone, maybe the class balance issue is lessened if you play co-op. Still, my argument remains that you should not buy this."

The game encompasses your player moving through the map at a steady pace. There is no sprint or dodge, but movement is highly recommended at all times here. What makes it fun is having a buddy to play with, as I couldn't really get into it playing myself. Would I recommend this game? Only on the pretense you're playing co-op. The game is fun, there are characters with their own respective power ups that you can choose from. On top of being able to use your shooting ability, a melee attack is supplemental to what your character has. There is also a power up that your character is able to use given a cool-down or given you pick up a power up laying around the level. Over the course of the game, you unlock different (constant) abilities in which you can decide which one to give your character. For the most part of the game, you will be using one joystick while aiming and firing with another.Thegraphicsare decent, they neither go below or above, simply satisfactory. Thesoundsin game for the guns are sort of meek, and don't provide any exceptional experience for your cochlea.This game has as much playability if you like the Warhammer series.

Good atmosphere that carries you through, an obvious port but not painfully so. Cons: Only local co-op, which is sad because this game was MADE for 2 player co-op. The game is short (only 5 levels, you can easily expect to see everything in a matter of a few hours, there are plenty of different options for replayability, but the game is over before you know it.) On balance, I still say this is a good game especially at the price I got it (under $10) -- if you like the Warhammer franchise and lore, it's good the goods there. Fine product, no regrets."

If you are new to this world play Dawn of War or Space Marine instead.  Those games are much more polished and balanced.  If you are going to play this game then play it with a friend if you can.  Not only is it poorly balanced for single player but the classes themselves are largely co-dependent.  The camera is very poorly programed and if you are unlucky you can die durring cut scenes.  To be sure there is plenty of xeno killing action to be had, but overall the game gives a clear feeling of being rushed and poorly constructed purely to make money off of people who are already fans of the franchise."
,Recommended,275610,10199603,"Posted: 22 May, 2014",all,Noheadard Stark,"A long time coming port from the console release.Simple to grasp, a standard arcade style shooter but without detracting from the delicious sound of a bolter spreading the love of the Emperor.Graphics are quite reasonable for a £6.99 arcade shooter, but since this is a console port they have neglected to incorporate a reasonable graphical settings menu, coined with a complete lack of a mouse sensitive option. You are being forced down the narrow road of using a controller. Narrator is very dull though, almost Tech Priest levels of monotone, and yet a master of quotes (""Drown the generator in its own filth"", ""Here comes the green tide""). However, the entire joy from this is from the rampant destruction and death, and it delivers well. Slow motion kill cams are present for random final kills, yet it does seem to slow down the FPS rather than anything else: this could be limited to my experience.Customisation of your marine is available, choice of four marines but only one weapon (melee or ranged) can be changed on each, and simply just use the most recently unlocked weapon because guaranteed it will be an improvement. You can also choose your chapter of Marines, however that's fairly limited to some of the more popular chapters (sadly including the Ultra Smurfs).Survival and local co-op for those with battle brothers.tl;dr: £6.99 to purge xenos filth in his holy name."

,Recommended,275610,22759969,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,Two Clicks,"THE LOWDOWN:In the future there is only war... as the WH:40K mantra goes.  And so comes WH40K: Kill Team, a simple story-driven twin-stick shooter set in the Warhammer 40K Universe.  It possesses some good gun-toting action, character customization providing different skills and weapons.  Thus allowing for different playthrough styles.THE GOOD:+ Its set in the Warhammer 40K universe.  Great if you're a fan.+ Good graphics.  Very pleasing on the eye for a twin-stick shooter.+ Good varied and well rendered environments for a port.  Gives it a good feeling of immersion.+ Warrior customization.  Good number of WH40K space marine types.  Together with good range of weapons provides some variation in playing style.+ You get to kill Orks with some solid gun-toting gameplay.THE BAD:- Its an iOS port.- Short campaign of 5 missions taking about 10 hours to get (all) achievements.- Mission length is also pretty short.- No manual save.  Just annoying save checkpoints.- Fixed camera makes controlling your warrior terrible in some fights.- Bugged camera sometimes giving weird angles.  Only resolved on restarting a mission.- Requires an xbox controller or emulator for one achievement (local coop).- Very little longevity.  Achievements force at least two playthroughs.AND THE ORDINARY:* RPG-lite perk assignment as you level.  Gives the choice of up two perks that grow in power.* Various time-limited power-ups allows for additional tactical actions.* Fiddly controls.* Swarm A.I. but at least it presents a decent challenge.* Some replayability by selecting different characters.* Only local coop available.  Need controller.VERDICT:Overall WH40K: Kill Team is an average twin-stick experience unless you are a fan of Warhammer 40K, at least in single-player.  It probably plays slightly better with a friend.  On the whole gameplay is quite fun though it has some frustrating moments, most notably with bad camera angles.  There are better games of its type out there.I can really only recommend if you are fan of the Warhammer franchise, like short games, easy achievements or are heavily into twin-stick shooters.  Its too short to buy at full price.  If you dont mind waiting for this, get it only at extreme discount."
,Recommended,275610,10235283,"Posted: 25 May, 2014",all,Talvox,"It seems all the reviews I've read for this game are all bad, but I actually quite enjoyed the game. It's not a bad port, but neither is it a good one. The best you can do with options is change your resolution (Contrary to popular belief, you /can/ use widescreen resolutions), enable V-sync and windows to fullscreen. Some people complained about the absence of mouse sensitivity options, but for me it was just right.The game itself is essentially what I would say is Alien Swarm with Space Marines. You have two melee oriented classes, which are the Librarian and the Vanguard Veteran Marine. The VV Marine is more focused on killing essentially everything in sight with melee, whereas the Librarian is a good support class with an area of effect explosion special ability, which is good for taking large groups of enemies at once.You also have two ranged oriented classes, which are the Techmarine and the Sternguard Veteran Marine. The Techmarine is good at holding positions due to his Tarantuala Turret deployable ability. (You'll have to hold a fair amount of places in the game, and the Tarantula Turret helps a lot with this.) The SV Marine is a ranged version of the VV Marine, with the focus fire ability which increases damage and fire rate to great effect when dealing with continued hordes of enemies.The game also features power-ups, giving the game a more arcade-style feel to it. There are several ranged based power-ups, some of which increase the amount of bullets fired (Shooting two at once, etc.), or how fast the weapon is firing. There is also an invincibility power-up, which gives about 20 or so seconds if invulnerability to all attack. The health power-up automatically heals a portion of your health then begins auto-regenerating until the timer on the power-up runs out. There's only one melee oriented power-up, the Righteous Fury, which increases damage, and increases speed as well.The storyline is rather basic, you crash into the Ork Kroozer, intent on destroying it before it reaches the Imperial Forge World it was headed for, by destroying generators and finding power cells. The narrarator is fairly monotone, but he has more expression in his voice than people who actually talk monotone. It's pretty short, about 3-4 hours when played casually,  I would bet around 1 or 2 for a speed run.I bought this on release day, having wanted the game since I first heard about it, but not having an Xbox 360 to play it on, and I wasn't disappointed. The co-op is a little bot wonky, considering the second player doesn't have a targeting reticule, but for the most part, I highly enjoyed the game, and would give it an 8/10."
,Recommended,275610,10640104,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,Goldenkitten,"So I’ve played the game through twice now and honestly I find myself unsure of where all these negative reviews are coming from. Let’s get the elephant in the room out first, NO Kill Team does not have online co-op and YES that would have made it many times better with hours of replayability. And no it’s not even close to the best WH40k game out there. But for $10 (or less if you get it on sale) it’s a perfectly fun little twin-stick using the 40k aesthetic that you can put around 4-5 hours into to beat the main plot, and around 10 if you want to round up the achievements. For me at least I got my monies worth, I agree things could have been done to make it better, but what is here is still quite entertaining for the duration its contents can provide.There’s not much to say gameplay-wise, if you’ve played a good quality twin-stick shooter before you’ve played this game. If you haven’t then the genre is marked by constant action, using one stick to move and the other to shoot in a 360-degree radius at any time like a turret on legs (or alternatively the keyboard and mouse works too). Persistent upgrades you get through gaining points liven things up as do unlockable weapons, they mostly just make you more powerful but it’s still a fun little side-item to inject a bit of activity into the usual twin-stick formula.Graphics are decent, outdated but the game is several years old having come out before Space Marine despite just now coming to Steam. Still they work and more importantly the colorful WH40k aesthetic is carefully rendered so even without eye-popping visuals it’s nice to look at. There are only the basest strings of a story here, usual fluff stuff; an Ork Kroozer is inbound on a Forge World and you have to stop them by shooting a billion enemies and occasionally blowing up some machinery, nothing complicated and it only serves to shuffle you from objective to objective.So yeah, WH40k: Kill Team isn’t the best game ever, and the lack of Online Co-op is a negative. But what’s presented here should still keep any WH40k fan distracted for a couple evenings. And given the meager selling price for what you get I think all the reviews ripping it apart seem really entitled, like how dare they don’t provide a triple-A gaming experience for ten bucks!Oh well. Anyhow I say go ahead and get the game if you just want a fun little time waster set in the 40k universe."

Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a top down shooter that offers 4-player co-op adventure that’s entertaining to the end.Story:Your mission begins as you encounter an orc ship on route to invade a sector of the imperium. You are sent on a mission of the upmost importance to disable the invasion ship and figure out the orc plans. As your mission progresses you realize this is an impossible mission and completion requires the top fighters. Luckily you’re a member of the Blood Angles one of the elite fighting forces of the Emperors Space Marines chapters.  It is up to you and your team to defeat the Warboss and protect the galaxy.Campaign:The campaign consists of five-levels, which vary in length based on your play style. Each level took me around 30-minutes, with the campaign lasting about 3-4 hours depending on how many times you die. One of the pit falls is that when you die you typically either get warped back a considerable distance or you have to watch a cinematic again. I didn’t find myself dying too much, so it wasn’t too bad but it could get annoying if you happened to die quite a few times. Overall the campaign is typically a run with a varying missions in-between; either surviving waves of enemies in a confined space, running on exploding platforms, planting explosives, fighting epic boss battles, and more.Gameplay:Overall there are a good variety of enemies which keep the game interesting and offering a nice variety. There are four separate classes two melee and two ranged specialists. The classes form a bell curve of extreme range power to extreme melee power. The weapons and ability power-ups are unlocked randomly throughout the campaign and to achieve the best benefits typically involves switching characters between each map. Each class has a special ability that offers even more diversity between each class. The campaign is a top down shooter where hordes of enemies charge at you and you must fight them off either by slashing them apart, blasting them to shreds, or exploding with bombs.Hints:>The metla gun is ridiculously over-powered.>The melee classes are at a huge disadvantage as every mission requires you to use a ranged weapon at some point where power is very important.>The special abilities are powerful try not to forget about them, there is no point in saving them as you regenerate ability points after killing only a few enemies.Results:All and all Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a great game. Some of the gameplay elements could use adjusting, but it’s nothing that ruins the game. I personally played the game alone and I had a great time and could only imagine it being better with some friends. The gameplay is relatively straightforward and the difficulty curve is well laid out offering a fun campaign at a good length. I would highly recommend this game if you can get it for a good price (I got it for $1.99 and felt that was just the right price).Pros:+Four classes with relatively high diversity making them interesting.+Buffs and weapons unlocked randomly which cause you to switch classes to take advantage of them.+Five levels with varying missions, strategies, and battles which offer great dynamics.+Four player co-operative experience (if you have the friends).+In mission weapon/buff switch to mix things up if you need to.Cons:-Relatively expensive for such a short game, $9.99 is rather high for a 3-hour campaign.-The checkpoints are few and far between and when you die they cause you to watch cinematics without being able to skip them.-The camera angles can be a pain every now and then causing you to not see what you’re looking for.-The melee classes were not designed to solo some of the missions very well."

Still it manages to capture the dark feeling and thrill of battle of the Warhammer 40000 world.

It is repetitive, the graphics are poor, it is buggy and the camera is terrible. The last point is actually the most important one here. Twin stick shooters live and die by their camera, if it's bad it really takes the fun out of it. The reason why it is poor is because it is automatically adjusted by the game and not by the player. In practice it works just about as well you would think it would, poorly. Additionally, it will often bug out and forget to adjust or take you way out of the action, to the point that you can barely see your space marine or he is hidden behind structures."

However the game is good fun while it lasts. It reminds me of the Invasion Survival modes from Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine, they even reuse some of the audio from the Orks ""'Eavy gun, Kill it!"" ""Too much Dakka!"" and so on.The graphics are mostly bright and colourful, and the weapon effects are suitably over the top.

Well get ready for the verdict!Firstly, if you do not own a game pad with analog sticks I cannot recommend this game as to be played the ""proper"" way, you need dual analogs, such as an Xbox pad or the pink PS3 pad I use. This game at heart is your basic twin stick shooter. That is you move your space marine with the left stick, and fire in the direction of the right stick.The game is not much more advanced than this, but where it does come for you is it's setting and it's ""Serious Sam""-alike with throwing hundreds of Orcs at you! There isn't much to write home about this game though. Sadly.The game comprises of set levels with some objectives, and killing more Orcs. The graphics are basic but work, but the gameplay is flat out arcade. It is fun in enjoyable bites and can be a great time waster, or something when you need a break from W40k DoW.I would have named it ""Orc Killing Simulator"", but I didn't develop it.

There are many games that do this genre better.A twin-stick shooter set in the Warhammer 40k universe.  That sounds excellent.  Lots of shooting and bloody combat and fast faction.  For $10 bucks, how could you ask for more?This game just doesn't hold up to the price in my opinion.  The game is nearly 3 years old and originated on the XBox 360 market place.  After not bringing the game to PC for such a long time, you'd like to think they did something special like maybe updated the graphics, added online play, or at least polished the controls!  But no, there's none of that here.The game uses assets from Dawn of War 2: Retribution, models that look wonderful when viewed from half mile from up in the sky like it was in the original RTS format.  In these cramped and confined quarters though, everything looks really bad.The controls work with mouse and keyboard, but there are some peculiar oddities such as running not seeming to work well and melee attacks often missing due to the odd way are ""fired"".  At least the developer was kind enough to change the XBox button prompts to pictures of Keyboard letters.  That's a small bonus that MANY games forgo doing.Finally, while I understand this was a couch-co-op game for Xbox 360, that niche doesn't really exist on the PC market.  You might expect some for of online co-op, but from my wanderings through the menus, I found no such option available.  I hope you like a friend crowding your computer desk with another body, because it's local co-op or solo.Many more minor annoyances exist, and I'm nearly shocked that this is the same price as when it first came out nearly 3 years ago.  If significant content were added, and the game was more finely ported to PC, I could understand such an asking price.  But I almost immediately regretted paying full price for this game.  Even if I paid $5, that might be too much for me.  My advise is wait for a steep sale or just pass this by for something better."

And while it's never going to top the Greatest Games Ever list, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.The voice acting and music are solid, both informative and thematically appropriate. The graphics are serviceable, and the physics interactivity is balanced just right to give weight to the combat without the bounciness Havok can occasionally lead to. It also allows for a bit of strategy, as heavy objects can be moved to provide cover. And the combat feels right, too - the Orks come at you in a tide that feels *almost* - but not quite - unstoppable, the weapon sounds are mostly sufficient, and set dressing crumbles and explodes all over the place.Add to that well-placed checkpoints, nicely-balanced difficulty curves, a fairly wide range of skins and rather nice level design, and there's a fair amount of game here for a not terribly onerous price.There are downsides - an anaemic options menu, a lack of mouse control in the menu and slightly sluggish controls in-game, and of course the occasionally infuriating automatic camera - but for this price it's a really fun game for a quick 40K topup in between dinner and bedtime."

The graphics and sounds are decent, it does have that ""40K universe"" feel about it, sort of a gritty steampunk environment aboard the Ork ship, what with all the chains and vats amidst platforms and scrap metal. Whilst the campaign is short, a straight-forward multi-part mission, because there are four classes of Space Marine to use there is the potential to play it through four times, to see how differently the game plays out with their various weapons and forms of attack but without lengthy repetitiveness, I could see myself replaying this a few times in a short space of time easier than a AAA game such asBioshock Infinite.I bought this for SP gameplay and don't intend to play co-op, but I do feel that some of the negative reviews border on pathetic with far too many expectations for a 3-year-old game at this price and ported from a console – it's less than a 2Gb download which suggests that it's going to be short and punchy, not a long-lasting open world RPG experience or as structured as the excellentDawn of Wargames. Works fine with an Xbox 360 controller, I haven't played a twin-stick shooter before, and I find that having to line your marine up at a 45-degree angle (8-way shooting), to pick off some targets who come at you from awkward angles, a little annoying, but you soon get used to it and compensate.My main grievances are: that some of the checkpoints are badly placed, cutscenes can't be skipped, and the camera angle can't be rotated to give a custom viewpoint – some of the fixed angles are a little awkward, but not too often, thankfully. I quite like the perks system, they give reasonable benefits without leading to overkill. So far as I'm aware the game has one difficulty level, it's not a hard game but there are one or two tricky moments.Overall this game is worth about 7/10 for what it offers so long as you don't expect anything special or highly original.

The only reason I joined Steam, originally, was to play the Dawn of War series. I would be the first person to sing my praise to high heavens for an Orks (and Nids) Must Die! set in Warhammer40K universe.As a software, it functions: it runs smoothly on my 4 year old potato, there is no glaring glitch or bug, and while some may complain about the obvious port it does not assign R2 button to your melee command so there's that.The problem, again, is that infuriating question of fun and lack thereof. Considering this is not a lore-centric title with the sole purpose of slaying Orks, it fails to deliver anything but disappointment--I mean, I had absolutely no expectations and I was still let down. Camera seems to exist only to fuel your wrath, power-ups and perks are as stock as they can be (because of how bland they are, the super-serious announcement voice for power-ups is all the more cringe-inducing), and the sound effects seem to nag you with existential, self-doubting question: why the hell are you playing this game where guns don't even sound like guns?The whole project, from the announcement voice to uninspired gameplay to its mini-game length, has something of a business-like air to it, like the game was not something the developers wanted to make but a soul-sapping obligation on their contract to churn out an action-oriented Warhammer40K game. As a fan of the series, its universe, factions and Emperor-knows-what-else, nothing is more disheartening than this.Co-op will not change the lack of entertainment or soul in this game, so don't drag your friend or family into this.

You either play it through completely - or redo the entire mission when you relaunch the game. Silly.The progress through the level can at times be ludicriously hampered by a failed camera system. You have no control over which way or elevation that the camera maybe be pointing. I've 'lost' the camera several times, often wandering off into the darkness of tunnels that I cannot see and blindly reaching a point where the camera decides to catch up. Again, a silly oversight. Why hasn't the player got control of the camera?Then there's the fact that the enemies appear every single time at exactly the same the point. On occassion when I've died, I've reapproached the same point of the level - firing into blank space, knowing full well that a bunch of orcs are due to appear. Sure enough, they do.I've yet to play this co-operatively and I think that's where the game will truly shine. Though god-knows how the camera issues are compounded in that mode! Also, the game itself looks to be very short - though I've not completed it as yet.Overall, a taster really of what type of game this really could be. Different factions of marines, much more choice on equipment and weaponry - and a random element of the opposing forces sent out to stop you. All would make this game much more appealing and enjoyable in the long term. As it is, 6/10."
,Recommended,275610,10271564,"Posted: 28 May, 2014",all,G3N3,"Kill Team is a decent game, which is first and foremost recommended to the WH40K fanbase (purely for collection at the very worst case scenario if something in this title doesn't fit your liking) as well as any player who loves a simple, straightforward shooter with the top-down camera perspective. Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team has a well designed atmosphere, and by immerging the player into it, the game easily incinerates time at a fast and fascinating pace. Slaying hordes of xenos is what this game is about, and the title says it all. As an action shooter set in a legendary universe where there is only war, Kill Team does a decent job for depicting and brining forth what the 41'st millenium is - Death and CarnageOn the downside, the game does possess a certain feeling of inflexibility to it, a feeling of an old-time shooter which could of been a bit more openworld, but this can be merely my subjective opinion, especially considering the fact that this is a shooter, not an RPG with a freedom of movement and action. Still, always knowing what will happen next, even if this was not inteded to be so by the developers obviously reduces the element of unexpectedness, which for this type of a game is a bad thing. There could have been more weapons, skills (each class of the space marines only has one unique skill, thus making 4 skills in the whole game) and content. The lack of ""flavour"", however, does not only affect gameplay; The interface too feels somewhat mediocre in it's seemingly formal minimalism - in this game, you won't find detailed icons of weapons, items or various skills, reducing the interface (which often has an important role of adding a distinct image to the game) to simple text and primitive looking ""buttons"". The enviorment detail of the levels is nearly, if not completely, unchanging throughout all of the game, with minor differences in the palette color and doodads between levels at it's very most. This is justified though, because the game is set on an Ork Kroozer - a galactic warship of leviathan proportions (my apologies for the spoilers).This game would be so much more immense and awesome if it would have some type of a Team Deathmatch or Deathmatch multiplayer mode, this is where the game would actually shine, and shine bright at that. Alas, this was not to be, because the only closest thing to multiplayer in Kill Team is a 2 player Co-Op mode, by either playing the whole campaign (which consists out of 5 levels, and they aren't that long) or by playing Survival Mode which, to no surprise, is about survival against endless hordes of greenskins. Again, there could have been more levels, but there isn't enough proportional content, and if the game would be, let's say, twice as long, then it would simply become stale and repetative. Out of the other, more minor downsides, sometimes the camera angle becomes annoying, with the player having no possibility to rotate or alter it in any way whatsoever.Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team, in my opinion is a good, absorbing game which should undoubtedly be played and experienced by any WH40K fan, with it's atmosphere and it's simple yet addictive gameplay being the titles most evident upsides. This game is great if you and your friend want to have some simple fun and blast through incoming tides of the menacing greenskins in Co-Op mode, or if you just want to indulge in the opportunity of steeping into a little bit of WH40K lore - the choice is always yours."

The game in this status should have never hit the shelfs.The game has no real story line except ""shoot that"" and ""blow up that"". Nothing is really explained why its there or where the orc ship is even going. Might as well change some names and this would be Warcraft franchise. None of orcs or space marines say anything important. None of the orcs except for 5th scenario where Orc Warboss screams:""Kill the humans"" (might play it alone, so only 1 human on all the orc space ship) and thats about it. That comper voice made me sick at the end. One space marine (maybe 2 still impossible) goes on solo rampage to kill thousands of orcs and tyranids. Whoever thought of this games storyline has probobly never read a WH40k book or even had a thought whats in them.  In conclusion story sucked so much...About the game play which was boring by the fifth scenario. Boss fights were annoying and mostly relied upon thrash mobs which were killed about 95% of the game. No real game mechanics were in the boss fights the same shooting and sh*it blowing up stuff.The range attacks in game are only thing needed. Melee attacks have 0 purpose I don't see reason why they should be there. Melee has no real advantage, not stronger than range, no special moves, no purpose for ANY objectives in game. Most close combat enemies can be killed by shooting at one point and you don't even have to move if you have a rocket launcher. Targeting system was ridiculous, the targets I didn't want to shoot I shot and targets I wanted to shoot most of the time I didn't shoot. Holding my mouse key all the time ""was so much fun"" (sarcasm). There is a reason why most shooting game weapons have somekind of reload system, so that close range attacks had purpose and that range attacks aren't over powered. This game broke both of those rules. About 95% of the games objectives can't be even harmed by melee attacks. Enemy intelligence was nothing more than ""run that way when near him attack"". If the players was smart enought he could trap enemies in corners, stairs and walls. The game most of the time looked untested and was made in ""its finaly over lets put it on sale im about 51% sure there are no bugs"" style.Graphics were good I can say that, but some game models looked really ridiculous. For example, Warboss tank was in scale of details of medium, but the Warboss it self looked like so high details that he could shine like gold and everybody would have expected it. Camera angle most of the time was kind of good. There were parts were you could understand that its angle is made so that ""this part of the game will be harder"", but most of the times it was annoying. I don't understand the purpose of so highly detailed models if camera was so far from them that all I could think was shooting those dots. Explosions were too much. If a player has a rocket launcher his eyes will probobly burn out from all the flames he encounters. Some game graphics were wierd and ignored most of the rules of physics. For example, how can a crate stand on air or floor fall in the ground when there is clearly a columns supporting it and how can a handgun destroy an iron wall? This is WH40k universe, but even their handguns aren't that powerfull. In conclusion great graphics, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ attachment to the game.I would give this game a 2/10 rating if it was my call. It ruined the whole WH40k franchise and I am disappointed.  I regred that I bought it. I would say there would be needed alot of patches to fix this game. It looks like it was realised in late alpha."

Also due to the game having control of the camera your reticule will sometimes move to the wrong spot meaning your shots will fly harmlessly past enemies.Cutscenes can't be skipped so when replaying or respawning you have to watch them over & over (alot of which don't show anything important).Co-op is local only so you'll need a gamepad and friend/warm body to play that mode with.Overall it's a fun couple of hours with replayability if you want to play through the campaign with each class.For the price they're asking, it's not a bad invesment."

All you really do is run through the levels killing Orks as you go and are rewarded with upgrades and powerups. It is actually pretty fun and I imagine it is even better played cooperatively with other people. My main criticisms of the game is that there are no advanced options for tweaking the graphics and the resolution is limited to 1024 x 768 and there is no way to control the camera angle on your own. So if your view is obstructed by something in the foreground you're pretty much screwed and it is fairly annoying when you cannot tell where an enemy is attacking you from. Maybe Sega will release some kind of update that at least addresses the graphics and resolution issues like they did with Strider.

The space marine feels fairly accurate, super soldiers who butcher their way through the ork ship as fast and efficient as they can and aim for the warboss. however these feel a bit to powerful, especially since they took down a gargant and a whole tyranid swarm on their own, if there were more of them this would be fair a proper tactical squad of five space marines could possibly do this but not just one or two. Also the tyranids feel accurate, one massive swarm that tries to rush down the enemy with their weight of numbers that are controlled by one hive tyrant.Fairly balanced.Well balanced, as long as you don't♥♥♥♥♥♥about to much you should be able to beat the game without too much trouble.Graphics.they’re not great but I can’t help but like the design of this game; it feels like ork krooser, everything is made of mismatching bits of scrap and looted stuff bolted and welded together into a ramshackle patchwork of machinery that really should not work, but it does... because orks.Cons.Controls feel a bit awkward.Fairly obvious what this means, controls are awkward and it is very obvious that this is made for the Xbox, shooting is odd as is melee.Camera.This is the main problem, the camera is just so weird, is can be really annoying when it goes into an odd angle. Not much else to say, the camera is just horrible.This game is definitely worth picking up if you want a cheap game to play through over a day or two and vent your pent up rage as you gun down waves of orks and tyraninds and chop grots into pieces. however if you want a game that has a lot of replay value and fulfils your bloodlust then get space marine instead, costs more and the extra cost is worth it, better graphics, more accurate to the fluff and has a better combat system in general.That’s all in have to say sorry for any Grammar, or speeling mistakes. May slaanesh bless you."

It's also got refreshing ideas, new characters, weapons & enemies to play with, and enough things dying or exploding around you to keep you entertained for quite some time. Play difficulty is also somewhat balanced, and the lore is pretty accurate.On the other hand though, everything sort of just stops short of greatness. The lore doesn't introduce anything new or refreshing, certain weapons are either inaccurate or don't really differ from others (high RoF rocket launcher? Really?), the weapons don't feel as satisfying as in Space Marine, certain missions feel unbalanced or rigged unintentionally against you, music is recycled from DoW2, and most of the animations which make all previous Warhammer 40K games so satisfying and unique are gone in the name of fast, unending action.I guess that's all because the game is a dual-stick shooter, which has it's uses.

Unfortunately, it is grievously misnamed and has nothing to do with the game mode Kill Team... which is too bad. I was looking forward to tactical, team-based action with very limited manpower and a sharp attention to attrition and strategy.Instead, I got a very generic 3rd person gauntlet-style shooter.  It's not horrible, but even at the few dollars I spent, I don't feel I got my money's worth.  I can't understand charging $10 for what feels like a mod.  While playing I went from waypoint to waypoint in a completely linear path, shooting orcs on the way.  And that's it.  I got so tired of fighting orks -- there's no strategy to it, and every wave feels the same.  It just went on and on... and nothing really became interesting over time.  Other games have done a much better job at this style of 3rd-person game, including a game I got for free with my graphics card years ago and enjoyed playing all the way through (Space Siege).  This game doesn't bring much to the genre, and feels very samey and tired very quickly.I'm told this game is Coop, but it doesn't scale the difficulty to meet the extra player.  This is a mistake since the single-player game is overly easy and time consuming already.  I did the first few missions, and finally quit out of boredom.  And disappointment.Protip: If you're going to sell a glorified game mod (and really, this feels like a mod, not a full release), don't misname it after a far superior (and popular) rules set that doesn't have anything to do with your game!"

This was funny at first, but once I got to the third level there's an sequence where your character arrives to the level via elevator. The physics are so bad, that your character falls -through- the elevator to their death. I cannot continue passed this point."

I did this a couple dozen times determined to get past this and enjoy the rest of the stage as I had on the 3rd one.  After dogged determination and some luck I got past this moving platform.  Now there are four teleporter rooms to explore and on the last one they have you enter... you guess it another moving platform.  Only this time it moves from left to right instead of elevator style.

First you got your poster boy librarian, his weapon selections vary upon different types of force swords. Each class only gets 3 weapons, some obviously better than others. The librarian's special ability is a warp blast that is good for killing enemies in a large group arond you.The tech marine uses standard small arms (Bolter, Plasma Melta. PS the melta isn't that great.) His special ability is to throw down a nifty turret to kill dudesThe devistator is your heavy weapons guy. He was my personal favorite as his special ability to rapid fire his weapon paired with a heavy bolter was a glorious sight as i'd mock the greenskin hordes as they tried in vein to attack me in close combat. (Use the devistator's special with missile launcher for maximum lolz)Lastly your assault marine, who like your Librarian is a close combat monster. He uses his jump pack to mow down enemies. I reccommend the lightning claw with this one.Aside from classes you can choose select chapters to  be. Blood ravens, Ultrasmurfs, White Scars, Imp fists, Blood Angels, and Salamandars are on the roster. Sadly no spacewolves, but still it's a diverse enough to selection to satisfy.All in all I think it's a worth while little Arcade shooter A friend and I had a lot of fun playing the campaign and survival modes.BIGGEST CONS!

So every time I die I have to watch stupid boring cunscenes that just stop my progress. Hate this. Huge waste of time. Game just got me angry. Was it that hard to make a ""hold X to skip the scene"" option?Get it on a huge sale or bundle, if you're a huge 40K fan and finished all others 40K games."

Then suddenly I can't see where I'm going. I restarted the game, restarted the computer, then that's it. Nothing will fix this camera bug. This is a shame to the Holy Galactic Imperium of Mankind under the guidance and power of the God-Emperor. May the designers and producers of this game be forever sentenced to serve as Slaanesh's toys."

The controls are sub standard and the camera is infuriating (it's not manually controllable).  The UI is horrible, forcing you to scroll endlessly through options one at a time rather than a dropdown menu like any other PC game would use.Tried to like this, and certainly not the worst game out there, but not worth my time."

If the game had online co-op it would be more enjoyable."

There are also no graphic options which also makes this PC port a rush project.Overall if you can ignore the bugs and dont mind restarting a mission or dieing to restart at a check point so you can fix the camera that got lodged into the terrain its a pretty ok game.Kinda wish steam had a 3rd recommend button labelled ""50-50"". But till alot of the bugs get squished and the camera that follows you around gets fixed the game is pretty bad."

A few annoyances though; 1) you can't skip the intro scenes so when you die you have to sit and wait for the guy to tell you what to do again. 2) Apparently during a mini cut scene your character can run to a hole in the ground, fall through and die forcing you to start the level all over again. 3) Random game crashes"

It is relatively short, but to unlock all achievements you need to complete the game twice. You can only play with space marines. You can choose from a handful of classes that can be altered with weapons you unlock during the game.The automatic over-head camera angle is very annoying sometimes. A couple of bugs, but nothing serious.The story is rather average, nothing special at all. You can say the same about the graphics and sound as well.Overall it's not a bad game, especially if you have someone to play with in local co-op. There is no online game mode."

It's basically a side-scrolling shooter converted into 3D. Sometimes the camera is just a little dodgy, but they've done a great job of setting it up so that it's always playable. The radar helps when the camera isn't pointed where you want it to.I wouldn't clal this game sophisticated or complex, but if tried to put on those airs it would ruin it. Enjoy playing the heroic space marine saving the forge world."
