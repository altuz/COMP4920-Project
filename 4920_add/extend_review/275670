I enjoy the premise and I enjoy Tower Defense style games, but I don't find micromanaging turrets any fun. If they add in a tactical pause option I may find myself going back to those levels and changing my review accordingly. If you happen to enjoy that sort of gameplay mechanic you will probably enjoy the games later levels, but if not I really couldn't recommend the game. There is also the problem of gamebreaking bugs, see below for details here. That is the short summary of why I can't recommend the game personally. For further details keep reading.Pros+Great premise which freshens the stale Tower Defense genre.+Voice acting is generally humerous.+Variety of turrets/upgrades is relatively small, but generally each feel unique.Cons-Micromanaging turrets, which may be a plus for some people but not for me. Also, here a tactical pause would alleviate this con.-Gamebreaking bugs, after my 6 or so hours playing the game the game froze and or exited to windows a dozen times. This usually happened when a new unit was introduced and then it would freeze/exit and I would then have to start all over on that level.-Turrets/Upgrades while unique feeling would benefit from more upgrades or options. Also, the idea that all the later turrets take up more space on the ship and thus generally undoing what benefits the stronger turret gave.That is the overview of the game, in my opinion. I will update my review, if/when they update patch fixes for the tactical pause and gamebreaking bugs."

After you've realized that this is not the case and you're given a specific ship template per storyline mission, you then think: ""Well, even without the sandbox ability to create your own ship, the missions do get progressively harder and you do get cool upgrades as the game progresses.""  You then realize, that there are only 5 different types of missions and the upgrades become less relevant after completing all of the weapon upgrades.Mid-way into the game, you start to get frustrated by how unforgiving and repetitive the missions are and it simply becomes a memorization game where you memorize where the waves come first and plan accordingly to achieve the much desired 5 star rating. You start to rely on hotkeys to fend of waves of new enemies that come in every 10 seconds and you have no time to pause the game (no pause button) or just look at your ship in great detail. Only at the end of the mission, do you have any time to realize the beauty of your ship, but by that time you're so frustrated that you just want to get to the next mission.In the end, I had to view walk-through videos for the last 5 missions since I was simply tired of memorizing when each wave comes in and when to build what structures at what locations accordingly. The upgrades became worthless after the last 10 missions since your guns do not get stronger, but the enemy gets tougher and more numerous.Overall, it was a cool looking game and a good concept. However, I don't think it was a good idea to leave out the sandbox ability of building your own ships and how tough the time limits are for the 5 star missions."

Decent voice acting, nice graphics, and so on.What the game description doesn't mention is that Space Run is the most irritating type of puzzle game; the player must build exactly the right type of turret in exactly the right spot at the right time, or fail the mission. After about 4 hours of play time, you'll just be restarting missions until you figure out the sequence the level designers want you to follow, or looking up the solutions on YouTube; this is where it stops being fun and starts feeling like work."

You build onto free hexes on your ship, as you fly towards your goal, and try to defend yourself and your cargo from a constant barrage of enemies. Competently amusing story-dialogues, and genuinely exciting bossfights spice it up rather nicely.The challenge is derived from the way the game forces you to split your considerations while managing a limited budget: You must choose between weapons, defenses, engines, and other specific needs based on the ""client"" you are running the mission for. Focusing on firepower is easy enough, but youll lose speed and get a lower score, which limits your tech-tree advancement. Focusing on speed will get you killed. Choosing the right pieces, at the right times, is vital to getting the best outcome. This becomes more difficult as the game advances, because larger/more-advanced constructions require various levels of power, and because components must be built adjacent to each other in certain ways to function.If I had to complain about anything in this game, it would be that there is no ""free-play"" or ""random"" mode. Only the campaign exists, and there is no variance within said campaign. Once you have played all of the levels once, all there is to do is to go back and play them each again, and try to get a higher score. The game ended, for me, before I was ready to put it away, and I was sad to see that no expansions or DLC exist to get more playtime out of it.But, to say that a game was good enough that it left me wanting more is a compliment in its own right. Definitely worth the price at 15 dollars, and maybe worth more."

About 2/3 of the way through the game, there is a long level with lots of astroids called Asteroids on Steroids.  We cannot get through this level because the game crashes during or right before the boss fight.  It seems to be an isolated experience because I've only noticed about a dozen people complaining of this issue on the forums.  Most people seem to have skipped this issue.   That said, I cannot recomend a game with a completely game breaking bug.Ever.Until this is fixed (and I have no reason to expect that it will be; the developer seems to have abandonded support for this game,) it is terribly disappointing.   I continue to check back every week or two to see if the issue has been resolved, but so far it has not been.

There's too much micromanaging of turrets. Every construction I make requires constant babysitting. Each level, while replayable, restricts me to a specific ship layout. I was under the impression the ships would be customizable.There's also this whole ""race against the clock"" factor present on each level, but if I put all of your money into engines (speed improvements), the stage doesn't seem to end any faster, and I just get cut up by all the enemies I'm unable to kill. No dead enemies = no more money. Seems like the developer designed a perfect layout for each stage and then tailored the enemies to that build. Leaves me feeling like I'm being pushed in certain directions instead of being able to fool around with different layouts.This game desperately needs a free-play mode, where I could build my own ship layout and fight off waves of enemies.

76561198058135852,Not Recommended,275670,33834095,Posted: 27 July,all,rc,"This is a tower defence game where the twist is that you move through a path rather than the enemies. Really the only difference that this makes is that there's a much smaller area for every weapon or defence system that you place. The gameplay is reasonably good fun and each level requires 5-10 minutes of concentration. However after just 5 levels I was already finding the game quite repetitive.There is an upgrade tree, however despite a range of choices it still feels fairly one dimensional. Most of the upgrades involve giving a certain sstem a special power which must be manually activated. There is no pause feature in the gameplay as there is in Faster Than Light and so much of the game becomes time pressured micromanagement, which I do not find enjoyable. The upgrades are somewhat independent of your performance in a level. There is no real difference between limping across the finish line and dominating the level with an abundance of scrap metal, as long as you complete the requirements your reward is the same. The game wants you to spend all of your scrap each level as there is no benefit to being thrifty.The dialogue in this game is truly terrible. Thankfully you are able to skip the dialogue and none of it has any bearing on the gameplay. Still, this turns the game into a series of individual repetitive missions as opposed to a game with any real story and progress.There are much better strategy games and tower defenders out there."
,Recommended,275670,11774637,"Posted: 18 August, 2014",all,Praxis-[CE],"Move over Han Solo and Malcolm Reynolds, meet Buck Mann.Space Run puts you in Buck's pilot's chair, and lets you try your luck at taking on (sometimes dubious) delivery jobs for cash. As you pour your earnings back into technology and upgrades for your ship, the jobs you successfully complete will increase your reputation, which will let you earn even more. Meanwhile, your android business partner will give you helpful advice and constantly let you know how badly you are doing at any given moment along your runs.This game is a great little twist on tower defense that has you fitting out spaceships in order to hold cargo, passengers, engines, and of course, weapons. As you carry your cargo from one space dock to the next, your ship will be attacked by other ships, pirates, and asteroids. You can mine resources from the scraps of the stuff you destroy on the trip, and that lets you build and upgrade more weapons and engine power.There are a lot of different components involved, and figuring out how to best layout your ship's ""deck"" with the stuff you need to take is definitely a challenge. To add to the challenge, you generally launch with very little equipment in play and you have to add the rest on the fly (literally).My only complaint is that weapons have a limited wedge of fire and rotating the turrets manually can be a bit tedious in the midst of a pitched battle.Overall, Space Run is a lot of fun. I mean, really who hasn't dreamed of being a rogueish space pirate? And have fun spotting all the sci-fi references in this one because they're all over this game."
,Not Recommended,275670,18944446,"Posted: 7 November, 2015",all,Adam,"This game starts out quite fun but there's one glaring flaw that prevents me from being able to recommend it at full price.First I'll mention some of the positives. The game is an innovative entry into the tower defense genre with a very hands-on style. (Significant micromanagement is required at some points, however, so this may be a turn-off.) The graphics, sound, and music are good, certainly more than adequate to the task. The mission types are rather varied, with there being four distinct types of cargo that pose different challenges. (Technically there are five, but two are almost identical.) The game also has a good sense of humor.On the minus side, some parts of the game require significant micromanagement to activate the various special abilities of all your turrets, and it can be difficult sometimes to locate the specific turret you need in a hurry. There are also numerous spelling and grammatical errors in the game text, but it remains understandable.But the biggest problem by far is that as the levels become more difficult, they require prescience to beat, but the game has an inadequate warning system and no mechanism for rewinding time except restarting the whole level. The effect is that you'll start a mission, and since you can't afford to build guns and defenses in all directions you'll have to build them only in the directions from which threats will come. And generally you won't find out until it's too late that you needed, for instance, anti-missile defense in a particular direction. So you start over and shuffle things around so you have enough money to build the anti-missile defense at the right time. Then you find out that you need a shield or a missile launcher in some other direction, but only too late, so you start over again. I suppose if you don't care about your reputation then it doesn't matter, but if you want to achieve the ""fast and safe delivery"" then you'll have to restart the harder missions a bunch of times. This whole problem could have been avoided if the game included a checkpoint system like Defense Grid or a warning system that gave more detailed information about the threats.As a result, the game becomes a bit of a drag once you're about two thirds of the way through, and that's why I can't recommend it at full price. I do recommend picking it up on sale, though. You'll probably get about 12 hours of fun and 8 hours of somewhat less fun gameplay."

And the game doesn't even try to be serious which makes it even more funny.Deliver cargo on timed missions while constantly preparing for incoming astroids, chunks of crystals, opposing cargo ships, small fighters and up to some massive pirate ships. Some more dangerous than others.Make sure to have enough engine power to deliver your cargo in time, defences like shields and ecm and of course plenty of different weapons, all with special abilities.Graphics are nice, clean and effective.Sound is great.The music is a bit simple, but enough for the job.The missions range from very easy to extremely challenging and getting them all to a five star rating, meaning you've delivered all cargo for that mission within a certain time limit, is in fact quite difficult.Replayability comes from the fact that you have to gather enough credits and reputation points in order to buy every possible piece of equipment and upgrade which you will need for the more difficult missions. Plus getting these difficult missions to a five star rating will probably require many many retries and rethinking strategies.Levels are always the same and the key to success is to learn the type and location of incoming dangers to maximize your result in the next try.. and the next.. and the next :)Once everything has been achieved, there's no real need to play again though. It would have been fun if there were some more missions or maybe even some random ones. But all in all it has enough content to keep you playing for tens of hours.Missions are also relatively short. So it's a game you can easily jump in and out whenever you want. Although at times you might not want to stop as you try again and again. Very likely with a high blood presure and lots of cursing. Victory will be sweet.I've had a lot of fun with this game. It was well worth the money for the 40+ hours it took me to get five stars at every mission, including all the achievements."

The mid-onwards levels especially have nothing fun about them: every mission feels like a white-knuckle tweaking rush, not something you can just get into every now and then and have some fun with. Maybe it's because I aim for full stars every run, but still. You do unlock items and grind credits to buy them, but that's where the reward system ends - and on many runs you can't even utilise the advanced stuff because the basic cannons will still be your best option! The game just seems poorly designed in the later parts, it does not flow or play well.I bought the game because I liked the idea and the voiceacting and dialogue, but there is no plot to carry the latter and the ""idea"" was not what I thought it was. I wanted to build ships, not obsessively micromanage them, and I was hoping for some fun times, not this extreme timing challenge stuff. Note: you do not ""build"" a ship so much as get shoved onto a pre-formed platform that you can slap parts onto by grinding credits during a run.If you want to challenge yourself with a glorified mobile game then this is for you -but why would you do that?For me it was not fun after the start and hence not what I wanted.An afternoon's fun was not worth the asking price; I wish there had been a demo (and next time I will ""borrow a demo"" before I buy this stuff)."

This is one such a game; in Space Run your towers are built on a ship to help defend it while it moves from A to B.  This game starts with a solid fundamental in tower defense and adds on it by requiring certain payloads, optional objectives and even boss battles.What’s my motivation:  Really this is all just putting a good coat of paint over solid mechanics, you really don’t need to be moving down a lane as it is not all that different than staying still mechanically but it creates a good atmosphere as ships and asteroids attack you.  The boss battles are interesting as well because they might vastly change your approach to the level.  Some require very unique approaches that are counter to the way you want to play the rest of the level; especially if you are trying to get max stars.Try Again:  The game does not require a lot of time to play; a handful of minutes per level (assume you beat it) and most levels are easy enough to live through given the minimum requirements.  I like this as it creates a game that is easy to enjoy.  The challenge comes when you are looking to perfect that level; you will find yourself pinching for seconds or creating build orders and memorizing the layout.  To be honest, I enjoyed this a great deal.I’m the Mann:  The story isn’t stellar (hehe Buck would be proud) and kind of yawning at times but you really aren’t here for this and the developers know this.  It is told in a comical way that is so bad it seems proud of it.  Almost glorifying the grindy nature of games the story makes puns here and there as you think you are the gift to the cosmos while everyone thinks you are bumbling idiot.  Mechanically, not much wrong here either, lots of upgrades different styles; if I had to laser in (hi-five) on something I’d say the menus could use a bit of work on explaining how you blow the competition away (okay, I’ll stop).For the cost I’d say get this game if you enjoy tower defense, even at full price.  If you aren’t sure wait for a sale, not all of us can be as successful as the Mann (sorry, I lied).  I hope you all enjoy this as much as I did.  Oh, I guess you could say there is a minor issue with replay but it’s $15…get over it."

The game consists of starting at a port, accepting a delivery assignment, buying upgrades, launching your ship, then racing from the starting point to the destination with your deliveries intact, while defending your ship against asteroids and other ships and drones that you'll pass along your way. You'll acquire currency for upgrades and repairs by mousing-over floating golden nuts which appear in space after things are destroyed.Once you reach your destination, you'll have rather long dialog scenes with your ship's droid, CEOs of the companies you are delivering cargo for, and others. These have a basic level of humor, but can drag on for a bit too long. Fortunately, they are fully voiced, which makes a big difference.

This is a game about ship management and balancing offense and defense. I'd almost say it's more akin to an RTS base building game as opposed to tower defense. You don't build your ship, then send it off into space and watch what happens. Oh no, you spend the whole flight turning cannons, activating abilities, launching volleys, repairing damage, and collecting currency.If you're not into micromanaging your ship, you will hate this game. But if you're willing to learn the hotkeys and enjoy managing chaos, you'll love this game.I think the introduction of speed and asking the player to sacrifice space on their ship for engines in addition to cargo and weapons adds a nice twist on ship building that keeps each level more interesting. It's not all about safe delivery, it's fast AND safe delivery!I'm not crazy about the levels spawning in a static pattern, so you can simply restart the level and pre-build up your defenses, but the game definitely takes this into account. It challenges you with some pretty beefy bosses that clearly expect you to spend the lion's share of the level preparing for the impending attack.I enjoy the characters and the voices a great deal.

Sign me up!Except it's less a tower defence game than it is a frantic micromanagement one. Things happen very quickly in this game and you aren't allowed to pause and consider your options. Rather than carefully managing the balance between resource accumulation and firepower buildup, you are going to be semi-mindlessly building, selling, rotating, and rebuilding parts to try and keep up with constant, unpredictable changes in the playing field.Yes, since each mission plays out exactly the same way, I suppose you could learn a (very long) build/sell/rotate order and try to play an almost perfect game by staying constantly ahead of the curve.

Knowing ahead of time what was coming next would have been nice too. This wouldn't have been bad as a turn-based game either. But as things stand, this is a very pretty game that I hate to hate.Recommended for people who like constantly and frenetically building things only to soon after have to tear them down and build other things elsewhere. Not recommended for people looking for a tower defence game or a thinking game."

The end result barely looks like tower defense at all, but manages to capture the best parts of the genre while possibly creating something even better.In the most basic sense, it's a game about placing things on hexagons to survive various attacking threats.

,Recommended,275670,11016040,"Posted: 2 July, 2014",all,Hello Gandalf,"With the tower defense genre being somewhat stale as of late, Space-Run is a decent attempt at trying to ""spice things up""You pilot a hex-based ship which serves as you your platform for turrets, shields and cargo. The intrigue comes down to how and where you place them as you place them in diffferent directions to cover particular directions the enemies come from (conviently, 6 directions). As you fly through space you encounter meteriods and pirates which attempt to damage modules and cargo. You also get some passive trucker ships (which oddly enough, you blast out the sky.. no reason given). In the end you are given a rating on how fast the delivery was and the state of the cargo you were suppose to deliver. More cargo delivered faster = more cash to spend on building upgrades to the modules you make.The result is a rather satisfying TD, where you get the urge to go back to give it another try so see if you could do it better this time round.There's a number of small faults. It's mostly just lacking some polish in this regard.-Don't expect anything in the form of a story. The voicing is good and the script has a cheesey humour, but aside from that there's little tale to tell.-Missions are scripted. All of them. Which this gives way for for some decent level design, the way the game plays feels akin to FTL and thus it lends itself to being roguelike. There isn't a randomised gametype or any sort so there's a lot of replayability going to waste here.- Similar to FTL, you aim weapons and power shields as and when you need them. FTL has a tactical pause that allows you to issue all the orders simultaniously. However, in space run, you are expected to micromanage you modules' orientations and active abilities on the fly. While this increases the pacing, the module based system can make this process somewhat fiddly and can cause mistakes that make you restart you ten minute pefect run.If you're a fan of TD games, it's worth a look at in it's current state. If the developers decide to apply the polish, I would recommend this to anyone else, especially the rouguelike fans."

As you'll see in a lot of reviews, Space Run plays like a tower defense game.  For all intents and purposes this is true, but rather than trying to channel your enemies into traps, or choke points, you have to setup your ship to deal with enemies from possibly any direction (though your radar gives you fair warning of where the baddies are coming from).For anyone on the fence, here's my list of Pros and ConsPROS:- It's quite easy to install and get right into the action with this game.  The information and pop ups on things that happen for the first time are designed well and not excessive (so restarting a level won't make you redo a help window).- It's a great puzzle-based tower defense game.  Sometimes you can attack a run with all offense, other times you have to take a defensive position... and in the most fun, a combination of both is often required where you have to decommission a turret to make room for something more appropriate for the upcoming enemy.- Even the lower level turrets come in handy in the later levels.  With most tower defense games, once you are able to pick up the better weapons the ""entry"" weapons loose their value.  Not so in Space Run.  Based on ship design, the direction/type of enemies coming at you etc., ""entry"" weapons are actually better options than the beefier ones.  It's a nice way to balance out the game and make you plan your run accordingly.- Great Voice Acting for an Indie title.  Seriously, bad voice acting can quickly take away from a game.  Thankfully the good voice acting actually you around looking for more.  While you can skip the dialogs, I found myself enjoying the scripted banter between our hero and the various characters he deals with.Cons:- There's not enough turrets.  There are basically 3 types of each turret, which are guns, missiles, defensive (anti-misslles and anti-turret cannons), shields, engines, and power plants.  I'd love to see more variety and weapons, but it is an indie game after all, and the lack of options will arguably add to he difficulty of the later runs.- Money is easy to get.  I think a lot of the negative reviews stem from the MISTAKE that you have to pick a playing style and go with it.  Frankly, I'd rather that be the case.  If you don't feel like you're equipped enough to make a run, quite and replay a run you've already completed to get more money and upgrade your turrets.  Fame and Money limit your ability to upgrade turrets, but money is easily earned (by replaying missions) and your fame level at the 2/3 mark is sufficient to unlock everything.- Once you play a mission, you know the mission.  It's fun to replay a mission and try different turret combinations/combos, but the level really is unchanged.  You encounter the same enemies at the same time that use the same weapons, etc.  I would have loved to see some level of random enemy generation, but I understand why the developers didn't take this approach.All things considered this is game about strategy.  How do you setup your turrets?  How do you configure them, etc?  Yes, there are times when you have to activate a turret's abilities at a key time, but if that weren't the case, you'd basically be looking at a screen watching enemies get wiped out (or alternatively wiping out your ship)? If you want that, save the money and head over to youtube.  If you find yourself devolving into turret management, than you're approaching the level wrong.  Try something different, each run presents different challenges, so take the opportunity and try different tactics.My rating: 4/5I think the Metacritic score is a touch low, but it's a fun game worth picking up, especially if you can catch it on sale.  Just be warned that you will easily find yourself losing hours trying to figure out the best way through a run."

It's all about finding the right combination of modules in the right places at the right times.In your first tries, you may fail, but later come back with a vengeance, after having reinvested your earnings for fast and possibly safe delivery of goods into the newest technology upgrades.

If you do like either of those two type of game design aspects, then it is passable. Not great, just passable."
76561197994979413,Recommended,275670,12038648,"Posted: 9 September, 2014",all,rmsgrey,"The good: it's tower defense in space. You take your hex-grid and enemy waves attack it with something like a 30 second warning of the next wave's composition and path. Blowing up enemies gets you a resource which you can then use to build turrets or activate special powers of existing turrets. You also get a constant basic income, so, while it is possible to screw up badly enough to get shot down, you can't screw up to prevent yourself from being able to build (though you may not be able to build in time).There's a good array of offensive, defensive and support modules to unlock and unlock powers for - completing a run earns you currency, which you can spend to unlock upgrades and new buildable modules.Weaponry comes as missiles, which are high damage, can be intercepted, but can be built anywhere, and lasers, which have to be built overhanging the edge of the ship, and do less damage, but are harder to block. Then there are ion guns which just shut down enemy modules temporarily (which is much quicker than destroying them through damage) and, like lasers, have to be built on the edge of your ship.Shields have to be powered (usually by building them next to power generators) but protect several hexes around them from all damage while they last, and regenerate automatically.Engines have to stick out of the back of your ship, and control how long the flight takes - finishing a given course within a set time gives you a bigger payoff; be too slow and you get nothing. The game does a good job of showing you whether you need more engines to qualify for a given bonus or will collect it if nothing disrupts your engines.Power generators provide power to the adjacent hexes, allowing advanced modules and module powers to operate.Each type of module comes in several versions, with the basic version taking up just the one hex and often not requiring power for standard operation, while more advanced equivalents will take up multiple hexes and require (more) power in order to do anything. Balancing space and power requirements is a key part of later runs, and where the game shines.The bad:The game does reward successful micromanagement - and some of the later runs require it. That's not a bad thing in itself, but it is when the controls are occasionally sluggish and unresponsive. Having to repeat mouse-clicks three or four times to get them to register in the midle of an intense fire-fight makes a big difference to the outcome. I can understand not wanting to go down the pausable real time route, but if you require the player to input their decisions in real time, then the game needs to reliably accept that input in real timeIf you mis-position a module when building, your only option is to wait precious seconds for it to finish building, dismantle it to free the space and get back some of the resource investment, and then rebuild it in the right space. Again, not a bad thing in itself - if the user makes a mistake, it's fair enough for them to have to pay some sort of penalty - but in this game, whenever an engine comes online, the entire play area moves suddenly - if you're lucky, the module you were about to place is now in an illegal position and nothing happens; if you're unlocky, you've just put the right module in the wrong position and have to face the penalty.Neither of these is a fundamental design flaw - though the degree of micromanagement required may not be to everyone's taste - but they are real problems with the game.The other stuff:The game gets compared to the boardgame Galaxy Trucker - in fact, that's how I first came to hear of it. Yes, there are things both games have in common, and it's easy to believe that this game was partly inspired by the board game, but there are also enough differences, and significant enough differences that this isn't just Galaxy Trucker: the Video Game. That said, there's enough overlap that if you enjoy one, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the other."

,Recommended,275670,10510253,"Posted: 17 June, 2014",all,Giniko,"Space Run has humor, charm, wit, and a very decent challenge that is well designed.The basic concept of Space Run is tower defense, but it takes things in a surprisingly exciting and original direction. Given a ship, a cargo, and an engine, the player constructs weapons, shields and many other devices as needed, all constrained by the limitation of space that the hexagons of the ship represent.The feeling of flight, of speed is palpable, as the ship soars past planets and asteroid fields, threatened from all sides by every manner of trouble. Pirate ships, tumbling rocks, and even other space truckers all present either a danger, or an opportunity to make cash on the side.The goal is to protect the cargo and deliver it as quickly as possible - the faster, the better the payoff. But there are strategies that pay well in doddling too, and there are times when it is sensible to hunker down, and times when putting everything into engines is better. It is the diversity of choices, and the continual unlocking of new weapons, shields and engines that make the game entrancing.Cultural and media references abound - there are nods to everything from Red Dwarf and Blake's Seven to Babylon 5, and more.Above all, the game is just plain fun. I highly recommend it as a light, enjoyable diversion. Each run takes about ten to fifteen minutes, making it ideal for a quick break or that waiting time before dinner.This is a casual, but not unchallenging game, that holds a lot of fun in a small package.It is worth the price."
,Recommended,275670,12650987,"Posted: 26 October, 2014",all,Captain MooMoos,"This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommendSpace Runskip toResultsand read from there.Passtech Games pushes out a rather unique tower-defense game that draws upon all new features. Space Run offers a unique combination of space tactics, tower defense, and arcade combat systems.Story:You play a rather cocky captain Buck Mann, a space runner, whose mission is to deliver goods across the universe. He normally doesn’t chase the credits, but some debits with the notorious gangsters has caused a change of heart. Buck is given a chance to by Big Cargo executive Susan to delivery some highly important cargo. This first mission unlocks the opportunity to prove himself as a reputable Space Runner. As the deliveries continue Buck Mann gains new clients Nuclear Star, VIP Travel, Out of This World, and AI Squared. Can he make all the deliveries and become the best Space Running in the Galaxy?Campaign:The campaign is composed of 30-missions, each company offers Buck Mann six missions each. Throughout each of your clients you’ll face ever stronger foes and have to fight off fearsome pirate lords: Captain Black and Brownbeard the Pirate. Not only do you have to fight off meddlesome pirates, but you need to protect your ship through asteroid belts and ever more deadly cargo. The campaign is ever changing as every mission new enemies and challenges are introduced keeping the game fresh and entertaining.Gameplay:Space Run plays like a traditional tower defense, in that you place turrets in your base and they target enemies without your control. Each tower has special abilities you can unlock with can give you a higher degree of control over them. Every tower has its usage and you’ll notice as you play you will be switching out between them continuously. A mixture of anti-ballistic missile systems, machine gun turrets, mass rocket launchers, super shields, engines that can control the space-time-continuum, and much more. This game has a fantastic difficulty curve from Easy to Hard offering gaming for all player-types. Hard is more difficult and will require repeat plays to get 5-star while on the other hand easy is so simple you can gun through it on one run and get a perfect game.Hints:>Anti-ballistic missile systems are going to be incredibly useful and in-fact may be more important than your shields.>The maximum laser turret is worth every penny and if you place them right you won’t need to worry about other laser turrets.>In order to get 5-stars you will need all the engine upgrades.>Play this game on easy for achievements, as you are not limited by difficulty.>Make sure your ship has got lots of engines early on boss levels, as they stop your ship in its tracks. If you are not far enough ahead of the timer you will get pulled behind and lose the 5-star rating.Results:Space Run is an incredibly interesting new take onto Tower Defense games that puts high speed micro-managing with unique map concepts to provide a fantastic gaming experience. Each map requires speed as well as a protecting cargo which requires proper management of the player’s resources. The unique bosses pose new threats not just on the players cargo, but they also stop the player meaning if he/she is not far enough ahead of the timer they may get pulled back and lose the 5-star delivery. If you like Tower Defense Games, like micromanaging, enjoy space combat, or want a unique gaming experience then Space Run is the game for you. I definitely recommend this game and based on how you play it you can easily get 10-20 hours of gameplay out of it before repeating yourself.Pros:+Unique enemies that keep the game interesting.+Interesting ship dynamics and management.+Loads of engineering upgrades and abilities.+Awesome boss battles and strategies.+Clean graphics and smooth user interface.+Fast paced space simulator with highly diversified playing methods.+Smooth difficulty curve – made for all players.+Cargo dynamics that require the player to have to play in unique ways.Cons:-Sadly no survival mode.-Turrets almost always annoyingly target enemy ship engines rather than their weaponry. Seeing as Engines do nothing for enemy ships it almost always results in your turrets getting beat up a lot more than they need to.-Enemy EMP weapon seem to always seem to switch targets while your EMP weapons shoot the same thing over and over. Result is all your systems are down and the enemy only has an engine down."

I have been an avid TD'er for roughly 14 years now way back in the WC3 Bnet days. What follows is simply my opinion. I will not do a pros/cons, however, list things I feel is important to help you decide whether to purchase or pass on. I will leave my bias out of this review.1) Each mission/mission type offers its own unique challenges. Whether it be massive asteroids hurtling towards you from the rear, alien toys poping appearing from the void onto your ship waiting to be blinked around, or wiring for a nueral netwrok limiting defensive layout.2) It plays out like you're the captain of an actual ship in space. There is no tactical pause. Everything happens in real time so you have to pay close attention to where the spawns are coming in, at what angle, and what kind of ship/asteroid. It can get a little frustrating when you get have way and realize your initial setup isn't going to cut it.3) The missions take no more than 10 minutes so when you do run into the problem of a failed setup, a restart wont be a huge waste.4) Micromanaging is a big factor in this game. With the RTS functionality, you have to moniter your shields, make quick repairs, rotate your weaponry, and manualy use construct's abilities. It can, at times, get overwhelming.5) Voice acting is well done and the dialog is fairly amusing. The story line is decent: -spoilers- you're a space runner deliverying cargo in space and have to deal with space like challenges. Also has good sound effects, visuals, and music.6) The stonger constructs are more challenging to utilize: power needs, take up a larger section of you ship, but come with the power to outweigh the negatives.7) There are many ways to take on each mission to successfully complete them.I feel like these are the top things to concider when making your decision. After all, money isn't the easiest thing to come by for everyone. I personally loved my experience with Space run and easily give it a 9/10. It is a refreshing challenge and if micromanging and quick reactions isn't a negative, you would do well investing in this game. It is not for ""casual"" TD'ersAnywho, hope this helps peeps."

Space Run is perhaps the most challenging, and yet real fun.  The voice-acting is pro, and sometimes funny too :DThere are 3 difficulties.  I completed 'Normal' (medium), and I felt like I achieved a lot.  *Phew*  I had to restart most of the levels many times to work out how to beat the levels. As others said, you gotta memorise the early waves (~5) a little, to help you prepare the ship.  This isn't a negative at all.  Most challenging TDs require you to do the same...A criticism is switching tower direction.  That is only for the first half of the game.  Later on, I was building mega towers that have wide range.  A few of those, and I'm covered. Guys, pls don't keep using the cheapest tower that allow you to switch direction; the other 5 towers are better in every way.Space Run is 9/10.  Perfect score would require checkpoints and pause. I'm gonna try out the sequel.  Yes I'm a little late, as usual, but I take my own sweet time :)"

,Recommended,275670,11058819,"Posted: 3 July, 2014",all,PetriZide,"Space Run is a different take on the Tower Defense genre.Each mission gives you a new ""ship"" basically a big slab of Hexagons in different numbers and layouts.Guns,missiles,shields,engines and reactors are built on these Hexagons. The better they are the more Hexagons they require.You also have to place your cargo before you start the mission. Placing your cargo right can be critical to the success of your mission as you cannot relocate your cargo once you start flying. Some missions will have alot of enemies comming from one direction and if your cargo is blocking the slots for placing guns there then you will lose your cargo.On to the mechanics of the game. In other ""Tower Defense"" games your turrets fire at anything within range and you get a reward for the enemy killed. In space run however your guns only cover a certain arc and has to be manually rotated to face another direction. When your gun has killed an enemy you dont automatically get a reward, you have to move your mouse pointer to the parts the enemy dropped in order to collect them.Manually Rotating guns,gathering parts and placing new structures makes this game EXTREMELY micromanagy. There are no ""pause and build"" buttons. Most structures also have active abillities that cost resorces to activate, further increasing the micro needed to feel like you are in control of anything.All structures can be upgraded after your mission with the money you have earned on your cargoruns.The game is alot of fun ,but in my opinion it needs a ""pause and build"" button. And the rotating of guns and activation of abillities is not something i really enjoy in a ""Tower Defense"" game.Overall an enjoyable experience, but with room for improvement.11/10"

I’m a fan of Command & Conquer style RTS & Tower Defense games so I may be bias. This game seems to quell my desire for both.GameplayThere are several advanced equipment (modules) that you unlock by leveling up your character & 3 upgrades are available to each individual module. Multiple options for equipment lends to more tactical options.  It seems as though there are several tactics for each level, thus offering a lot of replay value. Each successful completion of a level rewards you with cash for unlocks/upgrades, including replays. I especially like the “time-line” game mechanic in Space Run because it provides an additional challenge on top of the regular game play."

It's worth a look, but I'll wager that once players finish the game, it won't have the replay appeal that it deserves.The Good:  A catchy story that engages the player in the sci-fi genre.  IMHO, I feel engaged in the story to want my character to make the fast, safe deliveries.  I've even played the same job a few times over to get the highest rating and to see what the next job offers entail.  This is also necessary as ship options and upgrades aren't cheap.The Bad:  The controls aren't smooth and there's no zoom feature so unless you have a good idea what things look like while they're all clustered together, you may find some frustration when you're placing pieces and even orienting them during the heat of battle.  Maybe it's just me, but sometimes the bad guys seem to have too much of an advantage...I'm also open to the idea that I'm not that good of a ""tower defense"" player, but this isn't about me.  Another aspect I disliked was the fact that destroying a pirate's boosters does not affect their speed.  They manage to keep up with you with their one booster while all seven of mine where giving me maximum thrust.The Superficial:  There's some variety in this ""tower defense"" space battlefield even though it's simply flying from point A to point B (I would have liked to have seen a navigation screen so that I could at least choose the path my craft is going to take a la Starfox navigation screen on the SNES).  The story line adds humor, though your android's responses are repetitive.  Maybe the next iteration, we'll get to chose our crew and even chose a different android.  I for one would find a sassy female android better company than the annoying Addam-12.  I would have also liked the option of selecting the layout of the transport for my deliveries, but the ""one man studio"" developer made it work with the one you end up using.  Speaking of layouts, Star Wars fans will be happy to see a familiar shape on the BC mission ""Asteroids on Steroids"".  While I get that space is vast, I was hoping to see more engaging celestial objects in the background such as a comet, black hole, nebula or star.Though I do recommend the game, I would hope to see a quantum leap in game controls and other improvements should there be another Space Run.  After all, they made a Cannonball Run 2...."
76561198014871344,Recommended,275670,10504976,"Posted: 17 June, 2014",all,Warfox,"Space Run is an interesting little take on the tower defense formula. It is good that for the most part what you are defending is immobile(as far as gameplay is concerned), and it lets you concentrate on enemies coming to you, which is how I personally define a good basic Tower Defense game. The game is not difficult to understand, and the upgrade paths are reasonably forgiving, at least at the beginning when you're starting to get comfortable with how -you- plan to play. Gameplay can get a little frantic, and could probably use a pause button to let you catch your bearings when things start getting overwhelming(and to let you focus on easy-to-forget things like repairs), and the way it judges performance is entirely fair for the context of the game.Most importantly, the game pushes you into situations that make you think creatively. You have to decide whether you'll use space on your ship for your cargo that could be used for valuable engine and weapon emplacements. You have to decide -which- weapons to use, and what will be most useful for the trials ahead. The game does reward replaying missions, both with currency for upgrades, as well as the reputation needed to unlock new equipment. The fact that you can easily replay missions, even coming back later with better equipment to earn better ratings, and get a sizable reward for doing so very much evens out the game's inherant difficulty level. Because the choices are so diverse and useful in their own ways, this has the effect of making it not feel like grinding is required.I would recommend that anyone seeking to play this game be comfortable with the idea of learning hotkeys(they're simple and laid out around the WASD keys) because every second you can squeeze out of your interactions will save you time later when you need it. Said hotkeys would be a lot less necessary if they later patch in a pause button.Good luck, and may the winds be at your backs!"

,Not Recommended,275670,25494747,"Posted: 13 September, 2016",all,BadassFreeman,"Disappointments are worse when there’s big expectations. I’ve played lots of Tower Defense games, and this one actually looked interesting, bringing something new to the table and all. However after getting quite far, I’ve gotten my fill on it. I usually start with game reviews on it’s negative parts, and I will do as always.First and foremost, the biggest problem this game has is the lack of a few game mechanics that make these games so much fun. Have you played a Tower Defense game and suddenly saw how a new kind of enemy appears, which seems to be immune to some of your defenses? TD games usually have a checkpoint system because of that. Instead of forcing the player to restart from the beginning of the stage, you can just go back a few minutes. It’s a GOOD THING to have. This game DOESN’T have it. And sure, stages are shorter than other games, but the action doesn’t stop at any second, that’s why TD games have a tactical pause feature, letting you stop the action but still allowing you to analyze everything up, see what you need to change for the better and leave your new strategy to the test. Something this game ALSO DOESN’T HAVE. Multiple times you’ll have enemies coming from all damn sides and you won’t be able to properly see which towers are taking too much damage or what others are exploding to oblivion. Now that already sounds like a pain in Obama’s #ss, but that’s not even it. The game also has micromanagement, towers that have to be moved manually so they actually hit stuff, skills that need to be activated, ALL OF THAT WHILE THE GAME LACKS A TACTICAL PAUSE AND YOU’RE GETTING #NALLY ASSAULTED FROM 8 DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. It’s not pleasant in any way.The second harsh problem this game has is the difficulty. Oh boy, have you seen what I’ve just finished talking about? Take all of that and add an overly harsh difficulty on top of it, EVEN ON EASY DIFFICULTY. It’s a nightmare! What’s worst, the difficulty starts to kick in around the 2 hour mark, so right after you’re unable to get a refund for a game that stopped being fun, the game starts nuking everything with it’s unfairness. Having to rotate 8 guns as you’re getting shot might look like an interesting idea, but in practice it’s actually harmful for the player.Lastly, the game also has an upgrade system that I LIKE. However, I don’t like how it’s been implemented. You’ll get money as you win stages, however you will NOT have enough money to unlock everything, at the same time you’ll need a damn miracle to keep going through the game. It forces you to play easier levels over and over to grind for the resources needed for that new tower you’ll seriously need against the new stage, and repeating easy levels for a bunch of time is generally not what I expected to do on a TD game.Does the game offer something good, though? Well, yeah.The towers, while not having much variety (on offense you just have guns and missiles, with 3 tiers on each), they’re effective. Having passive and active skills helps the game become more active, even though it goes too far at times.The setting itself is also kinda nice. Usually in tower defense games you’re defending castles against invading forces and such, however this game changes that quite a bit. You’re a merchant and you’re defending your ship from pirates and other d#ckheads that want to steal your stuff, all of it on the go, and installing more thrusters so you can get there faster.The voices and sound department is also okay. The game itself doesn’t take the story too seriously, which helps bring a more cheerful note to itself. Starts feeling like you’re playing as young Han Solo, and the game even references Star Wars in one of the stages.Do I recommend the game? Sadly, I won’t. It’s original, and brings good ideas to the table, however good ideas don’t always translate into a good game, and this one is a good example. Weird mechanics that don’t quite work as intended, harsh difficulty spikes EVEN ON EASY DIFFICULTY, mechanics quite needed on a game like this missing, it all brings the game to it’s knees. Unless you get it for free or a 90% sale, I wouldn’t see a good reason to spend money on this. In fact, if I had known about its problems, I wouldn’t have bought it or asked for a refund before the 2 hour mark. Honestly, if you want a good Tower Defense game, Defense Grid; The Awakening is still the best one in Steam so far.TL;DR Edition: A bunch of nice ideas mashed together into a Tower Defense game that had potential and wasted it all because of insane difficulty and questionable mechanics. I personally wouldn’t recommend it unless you got it for free or stupidly cheap."

One of the best I've played.Many tower defense games have you set up towers and then watch as they do their thing while you have minimal interaction with them. This is quite different - every tower has one or more abilities that can be activated, and you will constantly be triggering abilities and building things during the game. There is no downtime. Personally, I find most TD games a little dull and found the frenetic gameplay of this one to be a refreshing relief. However, people who like more traditional TD games may be turned off by the micromanagement.Much of the technique involves memorizing the build order -- you play a mission once, lose, then try it again while knowing what will attack when.Normal mode was fun but a bit easy. Hard mode was poorly balanced - you gain resources so slowly that you need to replay missions a lot to unlock new ones and the grind is not fun.There is about 20 hours of content here, which will stretch out to about 30 if you want to get a perfect score in each level. It is well worth the purchase price."

It takes a traditional concept and puts an interesting spin on it.The goal of the game is to make deliveries with a customizable space ship for different companies. Each of those has a different gimmick you have to take into account when doing a mission. Apart from the first company which is kind of generic, but for which you can earn extra money in the later levels if you're good enough. You can skip the story, however. Your ship consists of hexagonal tiles on which you can place various modules. Each module fulfills a different role (separated into offense, defense and power/engines) and can be upgraded 3 times. The visuals are pretty nice actually and game play is fun if you like thinking on the fly and adjusting to situations. You WILL have to micro manage quite a bit in this game, so take that into account before buying it. If you do not like this, then you will not like the game. Period. For all others it is worth the money though.Pros:- Nice 3D visuals for a 15 € title.- Engaging and interesting game play. Instead of defending a portal or whatever from thousands of minions you have to protect your cargo, which can be individually attacked from marauding pirates.- Enemy variety is pretty decent as well.- On the fly thinking with micro management- Lots of different upgrades, modules and strategies- Trade-off system (You can't just build bigger and stronger guns without a trade-off, i.e. require more space, more power and can't do stuff cheaper modules can. Best example is the guns. You can rotate your level 1 guns and increase their fire rate, but they generally do not do much damage, your level 2 guns, do A TON of damage, but can only be placed in certain angles to your ship, which gives them a very limited fire solution, but you can ""delink"" the towers to fire in 2 separate directions. Your biggest gun takes a lot of space and does the most damage, but it can only fire on a fixed location. You will usually only ever have 1 of them at the location where the heavies opposition is coming from. Furthermore you need quite a bit of power and you need at least a tier 2 shield generator to permanently encase them in a protective shield)- Actually good voice actin- There is almost no ""progress wall"". You can repeat missions as often as you like and get the money from it again, which means that you can buy all the upgrades eventually if you think you need them. Some of them are locked behind the ""rating stars"" you get for each mission. You can't accumulate those, but so far I have gotten the maximum number of stars for each mission (I have 7 left...I think it's 35-40 in total) and have never encountered a problem here. Of course you will have to complete missions in order to progress to new missions...- Good value (should take you about 10-15 hours to finish depending on luck and skill)- Polished product. No bugs or freezes encountered in about 10 hours game play.Cons:- There is no pause mode. The game can become pretty hectic, but I suppose this is deliberate. You have to think and act quick- In line with the above it can get VERY confusing to actually find all your modules in a pinch situation and activate the correct ability- There is no auto save or quick save option. If you fail you have to go from the start again.- The story is presented in boring dialogues. The voice acting is good, but there really is no reason to listen to it I'm afraid. You talk to your android co-pilot, your employers and the 2 pirates in the game. All of them have a unique personality (including yourself) which is presented a bit over the top (almost trying too hard, but that is again probably deliberate).- The cutscenes need to be skippable. Every time you start a mission you have to watch your take off again. But the real annoyance comes in the form of the pirate leaders, who get ridiculously long and annoying cutscenes, which you cannot skip completely. You can only skip the dialogue one by one...- You cannot save a ship layout. Every time you fail you will have to create it anew.- Trial and error is involved.Summary: If you like hectic and unique TD games with a space setting that require micro management, on the fly thinking, good planning AND learning the missions more or less by hard before getting 5 stars and all cargo through (I am looking at you VIP Travel) then this game is for you and the money spent is well invested. If not, then do not buy it and post negative reviews."

,Recommended,275670,14783890,"Posted: 7 March, 2015",all,-Dresden-,"A very good tower defense game, Space Run manages to be pretty addictive. I keep coming back to see if I can do a run a little bit more efficently and squeeze out that last star on the rating.The basic idea is this: You're a space runner; someone who ferries cargo from point A to B. At the start, you place your cargo onto a ship comprised of empty tiles, and off you go. Along the way, you'll be attacked by pirates and you'll need to place shields, weapons, and power systems to survive your trip. You'll also need engines to get monetary bonuses for arriving quickly. Space on your ship can fill up quickly so you'll need to find that perfect balance depending on what your current needs are. It's very original and very well done. It reminds me of the top polished tower defense maps you see in the modding community for Blizzard RTSes.There are a couple of bad things...The default view being zoomed out so far that it's hard to see anything is one. I find myself having to hold down the zoom button frequently just to be able to see what I'm doing. It needs a toggle key. The other slightly annoying thing is the upgrade system. You can upgrade your towers with various powerful abilities, but sometimes it feels like you'll never be able to five star a mission until you get them.Still though, those are minor things and the game is well worth the money if you like tower defense."

Passtech has done a moderately decent job at taking a genre and making it fun.  You cant just drop a bunch  of guns and missiles and plow your way through, it actually takes some level of thought to get from point A to point B.  The genre is overcrowded and after awhile it gets tired, but this spin, like i said, is pretty fun.  So, in the spirit of hateful rants, here is what i hate about this game:You cannot zoom the camera.  Zoom would be nice, cuz, you know, it gets crowded.Your ship is a fixed point in the game, everything moves around it, which was annoyingThats it, thats all i can gripe about.

I had little difficulty five starring the missions.  I found that many of the various ""towers"" were either used little or not at all.  Still, the diversity is there so you can try different loadouts.  I pretty much stuck with the same emplacements throughout the whole game, only having to adjust it when a specific cargo got in the way of my usual layout.As you progress through the game you will unlock numerous upgrades and new emplacements which you can use on previously completed levels if you are having trouble.  A nice touch was that while in a mission you can see the various mission times mapped out as you travel (IE Normal, Lightspeed times) so you could see in real time how you are doing.  If you see yourself falling behind it is easy enough to allocate more engine power and fire up the afterburners to make up the time.All in all, a fun game.  If you're a fan of tower defense games and want to try something new check it out."

Completed all with maximum score and it was challanging from the frist mission to the last. The abilities and no pause fulles you with adrenaline, gets you on the edge of your seat, and even when victory is yours, you still have to be sure to dock properly with everything patched up.

It is nice, polished, and sound, graphics, astethic everything is conceled and you don't feel that something is missing. It is a full experience and it gives you many hours of fun (check my playtime I wasn't alt tabing thats for sure!)The story is avarage, but it gives you a lot of well realized characters, with theire own humor, and the main hero always have a quote up in his sleave to curve your face to a smile and you have a few plot lines that keeps you going to find out the ending.The towers and the setting is extreamly ballanced, everything is viable, but it won't let you hammer trough it, if you are too ineficient it will punish you, and you may complete the  mission, but you won't get the juicy stars! There is a lot of room for different playstyles and the combinations gets multiplied by the build orders wich gets multiplied by the abilities cooldows!Possible cons: The quotes durring a mission might annoy you being repetative and the pacing of wich you aquire money to gain new tech might be insufficent for your desires and force you to replay a mission for money, tho it happened to me only one single time, but I would probably beaten without ""cheating"" this way if I really tried.

It has its own unique way of approaching the genre by making your 'base' a forward moving platform (a spaceship) with variable speed - depends how many and how good engines you've built on it - and a time limit that will determine the rewards you gain from each mission. The fast and frantic pace of the game is one of its good qualities, and even though I'm sure there are those who will be put off by it, I'd still recommend you give it a try. Yeah, it's faster than most other from-top-to-down view tower defense games, but trust me, you get used it.I also liked the comic book style look the game has. It fits with the humor thrown around by the characters in the game, who are each voiced by above average voice actors, in my honest opinion. The sounds in the game are familiar sci-fi laser blasts, explosions and whatnot you'd come to expect from a game where you fly around in space.The music is also very typical to the genre; by no means bad but neither are any of the pieces I've heard so far something I'd like to listen outside the game. Still, they fit with theme of the game well, and thus I'm forced to give them A- grade.All in all, game I'll recommend to anyone who likes tower defense type of games and who are looking into trying out something new and different for the genre!"

The basic premise is straightforward, keep your ship and cargo alive and get to the destination in one piece as quick as you can. You place various tech components on your ship as you go through the level and as your reources allow (which you gather slowly over time or quickly by blowing stuff up). The components are varied: lasers, torpedoes, shields, power gens, boosters etc.. some with special abilities or temporary performance upgrades. There is enough fleixibility in size and shape of each component to make your fitting choices very interesting and replaying levels becomes extremely addictive. There's also a good variety of action, some levels you find yourself frantically clicking away on shield boosts, gun orientation or power ups, other levels are more a matter of carefully chosing the order and placement of your kit. The storyline is well acted with a nice 'Firefly' kind of feel to the narration and art.Overall, I am really loving this game, a big thumbs up to all involved in creating it.

The faster you do it, the better you're rewarded. You can increase your speed by building more engines or power plants (which help boost your engines) to beat set speed goals. But while you're trying to fly your cargo to the other end, pirates and asteroids are in your way. So to stop them, you have to build weapons. Weapons only get a limited arc in which to attack, which means the first time you play a level you're building as a reaction to incoming threats. However after the first time you can build defences where the threats will be. Again, power plants can boost your weapons like they can for engines.So basically you're playing a tower defense game with you buliding the defenses on a platform. As far as tower defense goes, I've played a lot of better TD games. But with one has a few nice qualities to make it it's own thing and not just a rehash.The story is sort of bland, but the voices are decent (though some are, perhaps purposefully, a bit annoying).All in all, if you buy this on sale, you'll probably get the money worth.

This might just be one of the best Defence games on the market, combining the genre with both puzzling, management and Space Sim. Imagine a tower defence game, but set on the lay-out of a hex-based spaceship traveling through space, beset by dangers of all kinds, from all sides. What greatly distinguishes from other defence games, is how compact and dynamic your defence is. Your entire ship needs to work as one and there are several modules that can boost, shoot, power, shield and add income to the affair, but need specific spots, angles and adjacency to pull it off. This adds a great deal of overlapping synergy, need for strategy and the feeling that your defence is an organic whole. Rather than a bunch of towers or units slowly whittling away at innumerable mobs, you really feel like you've carefully constructed a single entity - your ship - that can be carefully maintained to swat away at pesky enemies.Because your lean, mean fighting machine needs to be carefully maintained as a single whole that needs to remain whole, you'll frequently have to take specific actions at specific times. This can cause the game to get rather hectic, which is both a pro and a con. Frequently, the game will throw an amount of distress at you that can only be overcome by focussing your ship's entire effort towards the oncoming threat, by activating abilities, investing in upgrades, arranging firing angles; all things more than you'd have to in other defence games. The only way to manage this sort of frenzy, is to play it smart. Don't build 3 smaller shields or cannons that all need individual attention, when you could have just build a single, larger cannon or shield that could have done the job just as well, but would have required far less micromanagement.Sometimes however, even that isn't enough, simply because you couldn't have known what was comming. You'll be warned an enemy ship is arriving, but nothing could have prepared you for just what kinds of weapons it would carry or from what angle it would fire them from.When this happens, the game does tend to become a game of memory, where the only way you could have pulled off an encounter flawlessly, is because this is your second, or maybe even third run and you know how to prepare.This sort of trial and error can rightly be seen as a negative, but if you're the sort of player I am, you'll simply see it as a challenge. Having a bigger enemy come in for the third time, but on this run, your ship has been expertly designed to handle it without a scratch, can be very satisfying. The hectic hands-on approach and directly seeing how your actions are contributing to the battle, are rather thrilling. Like Hannibal Smith from the A-Team states: ""I love it when a Plan comes together.""On top of that, the production values of this product are just amazing for a defence game. There's solid voice acting and the writing - though hammy - is often worth a chuckle. The ship itself, the battle effects and the graphics are amazing. Rockets whiz by. The more engines you add to your ship, the faster the stars in the background blurr across the screen. Bigger components like the chaingun have a satisfying whir to them as the bolts rend through enemy ships. They blow up in a impressive explosion. The UI is smooth, comprehensible and Intuitive.It's a bite-sized game, none too long, but it's a satisfying snack. Reccomended!"

IT WASN'T ON SALE. ಠ▃ಠI'm tired of tower defense games but I enjoyed this one so much I've played it constantly.  I only have a few minor complaints, most of which could be easily fixed:- There's sometimes a bit of trial-and-error required to get 5 stars on boss missions because you don't know what direction the boss will attack from.  You have around 5 seconds of warning at most, during which time you'll potentially need to recycle a bunch of towers and then set new ones constructing.  If players had more like 10 seconds it would seem more fair I think.- [EDIT: The developer confirmed they're fixing this in a patch] The voice volume setting only affects menu voices, not the ones you hear while you're actually playing the game.  Since there are only a handful of different spoken lines, it can get annoying to hear your pilot say ""Yahoo!  ...I can't believe I just said that"" three times in a row on the same mission.- [EDIT: The developer confirmed they're fixing this in a patch] Cutscenes are unskippable.  Every time you launch your ship there's a 10-second cutscene and you'll be seeing it a lot.  There's also a 20-30 second cutscene before every boss battle.  Since you often need to repeat boss battles several times, it'll start to get on your nerves.- Tower balance could still use a little fine-tuning.  Rarely do you need the lighter versions of turrets once you have the stronger versions unlocked.  Some constructions and special abilities never seem to be useful or practical, while others seem much too powerful - for example, the heavy laser's Death Ray ability can one-shot pretty much any boss ship and only costs a tiny amount compared to how much you'll have saved by the end of a level.Overall though these are minor annoyances.

You are an intergalactic delivery man/ smuggler just trying to make your way through the galaxy. You get jobs, and finishing those unlock harder jobs. Its fun to replay these jobs later when you have more upgrades to try and get all the stars for it. You are judged by how much of the cargo you get to the point with, and how fast you get it there. you start out with basic modules, they take one space, and need no power to work. Eventually you will get parts that take lots of space, and need power to work, so you will have to plan out where you place weapons, generators, and defensive systems. Each system also has three upgrades, two active abilities, which take the same resource as building them. The third is a passive boost that happens when you give the system enough power. I just wish there was a pause feature so that you could build stuff and activate abilities without being overwhelmed from all of the enemies on screen."

Your ship is built up from hexes where you can place your guns, energy generators, shield generators and engines, but also the cargo you have to transport. Different clients give different cargo, each with their own disadvantages. Could be they explode hard when destroyed, maybe they sap power from everything around them. There's plenty of things to transport.The actual flights are hectic, as you have to balance getting sufficient engines to get the best result and thus the most reward with getting enough defences to actually survive to the end. My main critiscism here would be that there's no ""pause"" option so things are incredibly hard to adapt on the fly, but one might argue it's part of the difficulty. Luckily there's hotkeys for most options so once you get the hang of them it streamlines the action quite a lot.The voice acting's quality depends on your taste. If you like cheesy and slightly over the top, you'll like it, even if the android copilot's quips get repetitive quickly, but don't go in expecting high quality and serious voice acting.All in all, if you like tower defence that can get a bit busy with action, this is a must."

First off the upgrading is done between missions and in its place is some micro-management. For instance a simple laser cannon can only fire in one direction when placed but when upgraded, it can be turned in diffrent directions allowing some flexibility.The same can be said for the other structures:Laser AttackingMissile AttackingShieldsCounter DefencePower PlantsEngines.The goal of a Space Runner is to transport your cargo to its destination intact, along the way you'll encounter fellow (but minor) Space Runners, Asteroids and Space Pirates all try to slow you down or destory you.This game is tremendous fun and you'll want to play the missions again and again just to try new ways of doing this.It can get hectic at times but the diffrent cargos and abilities you can upgrade on your structures make this a Stand Alone Title just by inside in this genre, hope to see addtions to this tile in the future."

The only similarities they have are modular ship designs and traveling in a linear path on a specific mission. Space Run is a level by level experience. You are to deliver various goods or people from point A to B all involving you traveling in one direction in space from station to station. Along the way different types of enemies with different technologies, attacks methods and etc will spawn from various directions and attack you. You do not control the direction of the ship instead comes in tower defense play. Each different mission will have a different amount of ""buildable"" space on your ""ship"" to place various towers as well as the goods you are to deliver. Yes, your goods can be destroyed like any other tower in the game. It will reduce the gold/rewards you get but in most cases it is still worthwhile to finish your current mission rather than rage and restart the level. The game gets increasingly hard the further you go for each companies delivery missions and you are provided with many different options and play styles that can be fitted to your preference of tactics or what's demanded of you. Personally, I find it a bit difficult to get what you need versus what you want. Pro tip there is to spec what you think you will need for the mission ahead but there's no forewarning. This kind of leaves you stuck with upgrading certain towers that work in most general cases and you don't really get to enjoy the use of other towers due to the fact they're expensive or are too specialized against certain enemies that may or may not spawn this mission. Overall, it's a very fun game with a new twist you won't find anywhere else for Tower defense games. If you enjoy FTL or are a fan of the tower defense genre then you should get this game.

In simplest terms you build towers to protect your core, how space run differs is your core isn't at the end of a corridor it's on the middle of the map and enemies attack it from all directions. Another huge difference is you don't fend off feeble hordes of mobs but instead other ships that use the same towers you do.Gameplay wise space run has a very good mixture of action and strategy. Towers in this game don't have permanent upgrades but instead short time boosts. You can also rotate or change modes of the turrets, when you combine all these you get a very hectic gameplay that requires you to do a lot of apm in order to survive. There is also a tech tree where you can upgrades towers permanently with a resource you get by completing levels.There is wide selection of towers that really enable you to mix things up. Shields, power buildings and defensive buildings play a very important role and you have to find a balance between defense and offense to beat the levels.Game does come with annoyances though. Your android buddy keeps making stupid remarks which were intended to be ""so bad that it's good"" which simply end up being bad and annoying you. Which is exacerbated by the fact like he has like 4 lines of dialogue and keeps repeating them.There are pointless cutscenes, that are unskipable, which are just camera rotating around your ship for 15 seconds and takes away all control from you.But perhaps the worst of it is the fact that you have almost no chance of recovery once you slip up in a level. For example game tells you an asteroid is approaching from behind, you build 2 towers to fend it off, asteroid comes and it turns out your 2 towers weren't enough, it hits your ship destroying 25% of it. Now you have to restart the level because you can't beat the level and there are no check points, when you restart the level you just repeat everything you previous did before the asteroid at the same pace because you can't speed up the game. Because of these mechanics levels turn into: play for 3 minutes, die, restart, get to minute 5 , die restart, get to minute 7 die ...Another gripe of mine is that there is no endless/survival mode which i believe would have been really fun.

It works quite well and has a good average mission time, with very little unfairness. Some of the modules I never found use for, or they didnt seem to have a commesuate usage - but overall the game is quite solid for balancing out the module value.... though you will basically never use the base laser cannon once you're able to build the dual laser cannons which are great for the rest of the game. (with 1-2 exceptions where they're all you can place)For the other modules though you'll probably use them all for the duration of the game, which is definately saying something.So yeah, give it a shot, you'll likely not be dissapointed."

76561198096715394,Recommended,275670,11145077,"Posted: 8 July, 2014",all,Hidden Chimera,"I would like to say first off that I loved the game, and would wholeheartedly recommend to any Tower Defense fans. Now I want to address some of the common complaints.First: Micro-Management. Many people complain about not being able to keep up with the need to micro-manage their turret orientation. There are really only 3 turrets that change direction and one of those works only as a toggle on way or another. My only suggestion about this is to stop using the basic turret (and the ion) altogether. Except in very specific circumstances, the second tier laser is more powerful than the same three tier ones that it costs to build one and leaves you one extra space on your ship for something else. It is also much easier to micro manage than the tier one since all you need is one press of the hotkey. So use the tier 2, and if you don’t have the tier 2 yet be patient better solutions are coming your way soon.Next, a pause button. While be nice to a have pause button as part of a lower difficulty setting, I don’t really think it is necessary. If you take my earlier advice about the main turrets, that will reduce the actions per minuet needed to keep up. As for repairing, try using the second and third tier generators when you get them. They both have an option for repairing the whole ship at once (and it is often cheaper too, if you have taken some heavy damage). And of course, learn your hotkeys.Lastly, memorization. Another complaint is that the only way to win is through memorization. While this is mostly true, since the ship layouts can be pretty restrictive, having too much randomization in the levels would make the difficulty change significantly depending on luck. Also, not to brag too much but I managed to five star many of the (non-boss battle) levels in the 80 to 130 rep range of the game on the first try. It is possible you just have to not panic, analyze your ship for good weapon placement possibilities, and keep some tier 2 and 3 missiles around to use their targeted attacks.In short, I liked it. Most of the complaints about the game are indeed valid, but are compensated for later, once you get deeper into the game."

Perhaps the funnest tower defense formula I've ever played, the whole ship construction thing works beautifully and the speed delivery mechanic naturally caters to all skill levels while giving it replayability. So, if you're looking for a challenge, you can load up with engines and shoot for ""lightspeed delivery"" speed or even far past it, pushing your micromanagement and your APM to the limit (yes, it can get very frantic - you can't pause or *slow). Sadly though, the game lacks a leaderboard for this.Also, the levels don't change (or at least that I know of) so each one can be played over and over again until you learn the timings of where and when things happen.*There is an ability in the game that will allow you to slow down time for you to build, at a cost."

It's just too unwiedly trying to redirect weapons, repair, build and turn on shields at the same time. It also has no pause or slow speed. The build components are odd shapes and you have to sit there and try and figure out how to fit them in and rotate them to direct fire or effects all the time you are being attacked.

You're having to manage temporary power-ups for each individual turret/structure, changing the aiming degree of each laser turret, one by one, repairing each damaged structure, moving your mouse around to collect scrap for constructing, selling individual structures you won't be able to repair in time, picking a permanent aiming degree for missle launchers while hovering your mouse over others to see which direction they're angled to make sure you have coverage in all directions, trying to keep adding more thrusters because you have to go faster to get enough credits and reputation points to get better unlocks, and moving individual turrets' aim because those turrets are blocking -other- turrets from aiming.It's a micromanagement nightmare. Anyone who takes pride in their twitch skills or who is good at micromanaging or just playing stuff like Starcraft online and being fast and skilled might get a kick out of this game. However, if you're kinda ADD, OCD, or just awful at micromanagement in games, then it's very possible you may not enjoy this game. It's not an awful game, but it certainly is not a game for me or others who lack the ability to do well micromanaging in games.

Efficiently spacing modules and finding room for cargo is fun, easy to play in bursts, and it doesn't overstay its welcome. Having to balance spending on engines and offensive equipment is another interesting mechanic. The only problems I have with the game is that shields over the first tier are pretty useless, I've used the T2 shield once to any really effect, it's better just to have overwhelming firepower instead of protection, that being said building  as many gattling lasers as you can fit is usually the best choice. Another thing I felt was a little weird is that enemies always come from the same direction on each stage, so the game feels a little more like a puzzle game in that reguard, rather than building a balanced spaceship, You'll often have to restart the stage once you find out what direction the 'boss' spaceship comes from.I'd definitely like to see a sequel with new mechanics, and rebalanced modules."

I picked it up for 3 or 4 bucks, and I will say it was worth that price.  That being said, I just can't bring myself to giving this game a thumbs up.PROs:  Fun game concept - combines the strategy of a TD with some real-time elements, although one could argue the game would be better without this.  The game is decently challenging, especially if you wanted to go through and 5 star evertyhing.  A game type I haven't played before.CONs:  Where to begin.  First off, enemies come from all angles... the reason this is, in my opinion poor game design, is that because each level has the same enemy spawns each time, it basically just requires that you play and fail a couple times until you figure out where you need to stockpile your defenses.  The game also forces you to transport a ton of junk and severely limits what you can place and where.  This gives the game a very 'cramped' feel-  On some levels I've maxxed out my rig with resources to spare only halfway through the level, and it is very difficult to place everything.  It almost feels like a puzzle game more than a tower defense at time.  For me, half the fun of a TD is finding a way to build up a huge defensive front and face increasingly difficult enemies, and this game has none of that.Perhaps the biggest failure, however, is the fact that the game requires an intense amount of micromanaging, but is incredibly difficult to see your ship clearly or perform multiple actions at once.  This game NEEDS one of two things: 1) A way to pause the game and input decisions - so whent he game is unpaused, everything happens at once.  See Faster Than Light for a perfect example.  Or 2) If you want the game to be about real-time micro, you need to give me a way to hotkey my buildings and select more than one at a time.  As it is, it is just a click fest on hard to see buildings where mistakes are easy and the controls are cumbersome, leaving a huge disconnect between your intentions for your defense and the way it plays out.Overall, needs a lot of work.

You need to build, sell, and repair parts of your ship, activate temporary effects, and reposition turrets to point at enemies. Difficulty ramps up in the game by just throwing more stuff at you and so you have to click faster and faster, as well as adding more layers to micromanage.

Barely worth recommending.The enjoyment is in figuring out which weapons are worthwhile and which ones are red herrings.  There might be multiple builds that work.  I don't spend too much time pointing things, but that's a repeated complaint that the game doesn't pause and it becomes very frantic.  I stopped playing for years and just tried again.   It's not a bad little game.  But it does get tedious after a while.All the levels are canned, all the timing is fixed.  Once you figure out a level there's not much challenge other than trying other builds.  If you play long enough every level becomes easier as upgrades can be unlocked with enough play.And yes it is a tower defense, but the theme AND the puzzle of fitting components on the ship are nice features.The audio control is inconsistent, so you're stuck listening the robot say the same thing unless you turn off sound effects, rather than voice."

A very early upgrade you get is the ability to re-orient you towers. In mid-fight. And repairing, burst fire and other manual actions that you can activate (of course for a single tower, not for all) will block your ability to re-orient. Maybe that is intended to make the game strategic, but this is not what I am looking forAfter an enemy wave, you can (and should) repair your towers. Another point where the interface got very clumsy: You can only repair if the tower was not damaged in the last 5 seconds. No, you cannot just queue the repair, you have a grayed-out button and wait for the damage timer to expire before clicking. Sounds annoying? Surely is annoying.The cool voice acting you see in the trailer is not as cool in the actual game.Good for people who like hectic, micromanagement and clickfest. If you are not one of these people, play some other tower defense."

If you are good at tower defense that may not help.  To do well, you have to play the levels a couple times to figure out what to expect.  Sometimes you want shields instead of guns, for example, but there is no way of knowing that until you play.  This also effects ship layout before the mission starts.  The more powerful weapons only shoot in one direction so you better know where the biggest threat is coming from otherwise you end up wasting your building currency.  Mistakes are very unforgiving.

In its addictive fun is frustration wrought by issues not dealing solely with the genre itself.The good: Reverse tower defense!  I've always enjoyed a good TD, and despite its issues, this is still a very fun game; ever since playing old TD mods on Warcraft 3, I have immensely enjoyed the ever mounting challenge that they always seem to provide, and this game is no exception as the challenges come from outside as well as within.  That may come across as being hypocritical seeing as how I don't recommend it, but please, continue reading.The bad: Unbalanced modules.  Save your space credits and don't invest in anything except laser cannon, heavy laser turret, force field, and all of the utility modules.  Why?  Use laser cannons until you can buy heavy laser turrets (despite their extra range, missile weapons cannot hit small targets), use force field because most everything will be dead from your heavy laser turrets by the time they fail (and if they do, just recharge them), and the utility modules allow for quite a bit of flexibility (e.g. fitting in power or engine modules in tight spots).  The rest of the modules either take up too much precious space on your ship or they lack the adaptability necessary to get you through missions.  Once you realize this, you'll quickly find that your reputation unlocks a plethora of items that you'll never use and/or upgrade, you'll be swimming in space credits after a few hours that you'll spend on modules only for the sake of spending them, and there's a disturbing lack of options for new tactics and module positioning when you restart missions.The ugly: Well, I just said it: restarting.  What makes me say that?  Because you'll be restarting the same missions over.  And over.  And over.  And over.  It will get to the point where one module might get blown up because you were too slow or an asteroid will get too close to the ship and you may as well just restart right then and there.  Did you just invest eight minutes in that mission?  Start over from the beginning, however, because you lack a wide array of useful modules (try using an advanced defense complex against a huge asteroid or a heavy missile system against small pirate bombers) to change things up, you're inevitably stuck using the same setup again and again.  And that eight minutes?  No big deal?  Eight minutes here, three minutes there, five minutes from yonder... they add up faster than you would think.  Without any save option or checkpoint system or even a fast forward button, you have to plod along through the gauntlet from square one every time.  Don't misunderstand me; I've died thousands of times while playing Dark Souls, but every time you do, you can almost hear the game saying (maybe even taunting) ""I know you can do better than that"", but this game?  All I hear is ""Well, sucks to be you"".Space Run has the makings of a great game.  Robert Clotworthy (the voice actor of Starcraft's Jim Raynor) is the voice of the main character, the graphics are simple yet aesthetically pleasing, and each company's cargo you carry brings its own unique set of challenges in order to shake things up a bit.  I'm two missions away from finishing the game, and while I've had my fun, I feel no compulsion to go back to get reputation stars I missed on earlier missions let alone replay the entire game.  If the game developers fix the shortcomings (maybe even throw in a ""Survival: Endless"" mode à la Plants vs Zombies where you can build your own ship sans cargo and just get wave after wave of pirates sent at you where you're forced to recycle modules in favor of ones that can handle particular enemies better), I'll come back to waste more of my life having fun with this game, but as it is now, save your money and hope that this gets the tender loving care it deserves."

I have to press Esc to pause the game in the middle of a level, and think to myself along these lines: ""Ok, I want to put a missile turret here now, and then realign that turret. What does the missile turret button looks like again? No time to read tooltips after I unpause... Where is the realign button going to be? Oh, what does this turret in my ship do? I can't really remember just by looking at the mesh, specially at this zoom level.""The third time I had to do that, I decided that this didn't make any sense, and I'd wait for the tactical pause that I was sure would eventually come out, sinse so many people were asking for it.Now the developer has come out and stated that no, tactical pause wouldn't be implemented. The players wouldn't be interested in not having ""challenging real time threat management"". I'll be interested in just being able to play the damn thing, and I'll be the judge of what I will or will not be interested in, thank you very much.If you have a good memory and lots of time so you can play it from start to finish without a long hiatus so you don't forget what everything is, then by all means, It's a solid, 8/10 game.For me personally, with bad memory and not much time, without a pause button, it's unplayable, so I won't even bother to give it a score."

Most of the towers have one or two activated abilities that need to be manually activated. In the heat of things, you'll be frantically going from tower to tower adjusting their orientation or activating an ability, just to make it through.A good Tower Defense should be about the strategy, not about how fast you can click everything.Imagine playing an RTS game with 20-40 units, and you have to command them all individually. That's what this sometimes feels like.So if you wanted to try a cool and fresh Tower Defense game, while still keeping with the feel and flow of what you've come to expect from the genre, stay away from this game.It looks polished enough, but this is less of a tactical game and more of a click-fest madhouse."

From no upgrading towers in combat, a level one gun will always be a level one gun.

Your task for every mission is to get yourself across the map as fast as possible. The faster you can do it and the more cargo you manage to bring intact, the bigger the reward. Opposing you are waves of hostile ships that can fly in from all directions and do their best to destroy you. As a player you can place turrets, engines and other modules on your ship, which all alter your craft in different ways.The gameplay is dynamic and, unlike with similar ""defence-oriented games"", I never found myself waiting for the next wave or for something to do.

The game manages to keep the pressure on with a thrust system which moves you along a linear track with timed runs. Thrust takes up the same space your guns do, so a significant amount of planning is required. The first few missions are very easy to get perfects playing it by ear, but the later levels will require you to take into account which waves come from which direction when, what sorts of defense is needed, and how much thrust you need to maintain during replays. Content-wise the game is a bit light at the moment. Hopefully, this game will be expanded upon with free updates or some significant DLCs. 7 out of 10."

Simple premise: you've got a ship which you place cargo, engines, guns, and support modules like power generators and shields on.  You need to go fast enough-- building enough engines during the run-- to make a deadline, or go even faster to get bonuses.You don't actually navigate the ship, the flight plan is pre-set.  Don't worry, though, there'll be plenty else to do.Asteroid swarms, waves of enemy fighters, ships and so forth get in your way and/or try to blow you up.  Destroying them instead gives 'hexnuts' which is the resource used to build more stuff on your ship.  You need to also keep building and repairing your guns/missiles/etc, and readjusting their facing to be prepared for the next waves.  There are powerups available for your modules, and using them with the right timing can make a huge difference.  You almost certainly want to also build some shields at least around the bridge, the cargo, and the engines.But then, you almost certainly wanted to build guns facing in all directions as quickly as possible.  And power gens and shields next to them also.  And another engine...decisions, decisions....Survive the run with ship and cargo intact, and you get paid, which you can use to improve the tech available on the next run.  New missions become available, although you can and should repeat existing missions to be able to afford better tech."

,Recommended,275670,10518334,"Posted: 18 June, 2014",all,Suthek,"Have you ever played the tabletop game 'Galaxy Trucker'? If yes, imagine a single-player version of it, mixed with Real-Time Tower Defense.If you haven't, well, a few more words.Personally, I'm not a fan of regular tower defense games, but generally the more irregular ones (e.g. Dungeon Defenders) do strike a chord for me. So, along comes Space Run. I bought it more on a whim, because it reminded me of the above mentioned tabletop game, which I immensely enjoy.So, what is it with this game?Essentially, you're a guy tasked to ship stuff from A to B, as fast as possible, and hopefully without losing any of the stuff you're supposed to ship. To fulfill this task you get an empty ship made from hex-tiles which you can then populate with weapons, defenses, and of course the cargo you're supposed to transport.However, you only place the cargo (and generally a single cheap engine) at the beginning of the round. The rest you have to build, rebuild and manage when and as the situation demands with funds you gain during the rounds from destroying random asteroids, enemies and such. The placement of your constructions is a key feature, e.g. engines can only be built on tiles that face space behind the ship, while turrets can be placed in any direction at the edge of your ship, but then can only fire in the directions they can reach. So you'll soon find that one of the most important creeds of your game is going to be 'Location, Location, Location'.While the first levels (imo) were starting out pretty easy, the latter ones do have a tendency to become rather hectic and challenging, especially when you have to start to compromise (or rather, optimize) wether you need more space for engines to meet a higher quality deadline or rather place another turret to prevent your other engines from getting wrecked by enemy fire.Inbetween rounds you have then the Engineering section where you can upgrade the constructions you already have or unlock new ones from the money that you received during your missions. You can repeat your missions as often as you like, so running your favorite runs multiple times to gather up some money is not a bad idea, especially since getting the best ratings in the later levels really requires the good stuff, in addition to your knowledge how to best use what in which situation. All constructions have 3 upgrade, 2 of which are active abilities, that all differ immensely (at least in the weapon section), and one passive.The ""story"" of the game is pretty weak and is basically nothing much more than an explanation of 'You're a guy shipping stuff from A to B, so here, ship some stuff from A to B.', but honestly, that doesn't really matter, because, hey, shipping stuff from A to B is a lot of fun here. The game is split into several 'chapters', each with their own type of freight to be transported. Those freights will give you different handicaps that make your life only harder.As for replayability: Well, I'm not sure what happens when you have all the high-scores on all the tracks with all items unlocked, but I guess nothing. So even if I wouldn't say it has insta-replayablity value once finished (which might take some time; I haven't unlocked all the missions yet, and don't have the top-scores on several of those I've done already), but I definetly can see myself coming back to it from time to time just for a few fun rounds.So far I've been enjoying the game very much and would recommend it. I've heard that some people complained about lags and crashes, but it seems that I had the luck of not being affected by any of those, so the game ran fine for me."

So I can't recommend buying it right now. The little I played before it crashed on the surface was good, but it kinda sucks to buy a good game that you can't play.So this is more a warning, than a critique of the game.

Loved it.Space Run is all about placing turrets, generators and shields, protecting your cargo and command bridge. Ships are made of hexes, and their placement and number is defined by the mission. One of our main challenges is the time.On the start of each mission we must place cargo, bridge and engine. Then, we are leaving station. In the main part of game we can build structures of hexes, using HexNuts. Some structures have ablillities, like hot-fix. These abillities use power.We are making deliveries for 5 different companies. Each companion has different cargo to deliver: nuclear waste(exploding and taking half of your ship away), alien artifacts(draining energy around it or spawning alien crap on ship), AI(must be connected to your bridge before completing the mission), containers(nothing special) and my worst nightmare. these one-hexed things must be placed on the edge on the ship, and it takes 3(!) hexes around the edge, making it impossible to build lasers there.But time is not the only enemy. There are also pirates and asteroids. Asteroids are one hitting several hexes at once, and the pirates damage may vary. Smallest pirate ships (drones) are weak, but the bosses are incredibly strong without good tactics. Sometimes you will encounter friendly ships, which can be destroyed to earn HexNuts to build something on your ship.Some things are unbalanced, for example one of the lasers pierce through enemies like katana through butter. Some ship layouts are also unbalanced. One mission was extremly hard, becouse the ship had the shape of Millenium Falcon(Star Wars).The bridge was exposed, and you had to protect it with shields. Shields need power generators, and the bridge was so far from the main part of the ship, that the shield existed only to protect it. What a waste of HexNuts. But the worst thing was boss. Pirate, with MLGPRO360NOSCOPE ion cannons, laser cannons, shields, and rocket launchers.

Your cargo always limits your space, so you can't actually beef up your ship to your liking much of the time, no matter how many upgrades you have. Also, it seems like the ship is always laid out in a way that certain components can only go in certain spots (like you can only put the top engine in one spot, and you'll always want the biggest laser turrent in this other spot). It just makes everything feel constrained, like you can't just go crazy and make a missile-only ship or double down on defense. In many tower defense games, it's fun to replay a map and try different combinations, but combinations are very limited here. Also, the lack of reload points kind of sucks. You might get to the very end of a mission and lose some of your cargo, but you just have to start the map over, and repositioning turrets can get very old."

,Recommended,275670,13752319,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,MechaTesla,"Space Run is inspired by Vlaada Chvatil's board game: Galaxy Trucker, and it is a fantastic interpretation. This game is most easily summarized as an action tower defense game, with some very notable exceptions. The premise is simple, build stuff on your ship to protect cargo on it, while building enough engines to get to your goal in time. You're given a 30 second warning for incoming threats, with a tracker showing the path that it will take, so you get a little time to quickly plan what you'll do. You buy constructions with currency that builds over time or from destroying other ships.What makes the game a little different is that time really plays a big factor here. You'll be struggling to work out what to fit where, while still managing what's actually on your ship. Make no mistake, there's a good deal of micromanaging going on here. Practically everything you build has activated abilities, and you'll need to make use of them to do well. When you destroy other ships, it feels incredibly satisfying, and the game does a great job of making it feel rewarding when you do well. Similarly, tight situations feel stressful without being impossible, making it more likely you'll try to work through setbacks instead of resetting. I played through the whole game, and wholeheartedly recommend it. It's a great mix of puzzle with reflex and disaster mitigation.Some negative points for those looking:-There is a lot of time-critical managing. You can kinda cheat the system by pausing with escape, but activating one ability can be the difference between succeeding with a perfect score and utter failure.-Levels always play out in the same way, and to get a perfect score on a later level, you generally have to know where some ships are going to appear far ahead of time so you can allocate resources effectively. This means memory does play a role here. Sometimes you just have to know that something is going to appear from one direction over and over again.-There's no real reason to play defensively. Early in a level, maybe, but you'll generally never use the upgraded shields or defensive items. Because destroying ships gives you more money to use for construction, it's generally easier and safer to just rebuild guns that get destroyed by enemies rather than use a shield which won't bring you any more money. This point being said, it's also way more fun that the game plays out this way. Yeah explosions!"

The enemy patterns do not vary - so you can learn each level - but the number of design choices is very high and your performance can also be impacted by timing special abilities and where to point your guns. I'm not certain it will be something I stick with long - but as a short diversion it has clear quality."

The tagline says it all; get your cargo to its destination as fast, and as damage free as you can.  This can be done numerous different ways, but as you fine tune your technique, you'll arrive sooner with less damage.

If you hear ""tower defense"" and just groan, this game likely is not for you. However, if you've enjoyed the genre in the past, and think you might have more left in you, but maybe are bored of the usual formula, give this a shot!Gameplay is as follows:- you build a ship, hex by hex, supplying turrets, missiles, shields, and power.- your ship launches and travels a straight line path from A to B. Your job is to make it to B as intact as you can.- on the way, you will be assaulted by all manner of ship and asteroid strikes, hoping your turrets and shields etc. can adequately defend you.- Providing further depth and keeping with the theme, your job is also to transfer cargo of various kinds from A to B, getting more cash the more cargo you deliver intact. Each cargo takes up valuable hexes on your ship with various mechanical complications, like cargo that MUST be placed on the vulnerable exterior edge of the ship, or cargo that drains power from all adjacent hexes.I was definitely very happy with this out-of-nowhere indie TD, at full-price no less."

Visuals and color pallet are good, the music is enjoyable without being too mellow or overbearing, and the limited voice acting conveys the story appropriately.  Space Run follows the traditional build towers as the level progresses and the warning radar informs you where to best place towers for the upcoming wave.  This game would be much better with more levels available (or a randomizer), but the client differences are the spice of this game.  Most tower defense are the same thing beginning to end, but, in Space Run the client's containers change up the level approach significantly; kudos for making the cargo affect the game.  Big Cargo pods can be located anywhere, Nuclear Star material is best kept safe toward the interior of the ship or you risk massive explosions, VIP Travel cabins are forced to the edge where you lose valuable turret placement options, and the other two clients also throw curves into their missions.  The missions themselves are paced correctly, are not overly long making it easy to replay for five star rankings, and any difficulty can be overcome with a tactical alteration.  I'd like to see some challenge zones with upfront tower building and some configurable ship layouts choices, but as it stands, Space Run is a unique and fun tower defense game."

A pretty simple one, mind you. But in depth, it's much more than that.While the basic of the game consist of building offensive and defensive weapons to keep your ship alive, as well as thrusters to actually move through space, the active part of combat is much more complex than a simple tower defense game. Every structure comes with 3 upgrade slots that can be purchased with credits earned from previous runs. These upgrades mostly consist of 2 active upgrades and one passive upgrade. The active upgrades range from reorienting weapons, over massive single-time attack to quick-repair.All in all, the tower defense aspect of the game is just one part of it. Using active abilities wiesely, adjsuting to your stubborn cargo and handling all the micro-management, is the really big part of the game. And no, we don't need a pause button or anything, be fast or die, that's it, that's the challenging part of the game. - And really, it's not thaat hard.Space Run is an interesting and fun mix approach that will kepp you well entertained for ~10h if you want to complete it.

This old ad line comes to my mind after playing Space Run for 3 hours straight after purchase.Interface is great, graphics are fine, voice acting is excellent, and the game has great replay value. It has taken me maybe 4-5 runs of each mission to achieve maximum score but replaying does not feel like grind: the missions themselves are (so far at least - I have unlocked only 6 or 7) relatively short, the longest one I clocked at about 8 minutes. Space Run makes it quite easy for us obsessive-compulsive gamer nerds to let go and come back to it later.As I write this, I am thinking really hard to find something wrong with this title but really the only thing I can come up with is that *maybe* somebody might find the soundtrack a bit too repetitive. But given how much Space Run has to offer, and considering how cheap it is, that's really not an issue. You could always play your favorite music in the background and turn off game music from the menu.If you're hesitating, I'd say give Space Run a go: chances are, you will like it, and the price is great (there is a 25% discount as I write this, but even without it, the game is worth every penny).See you in space!"

It is an interesting take on tower defense but it's even more fun to upgrade a spaceship than to just put towers around a map.The only thing that seems to need work is the progression. Everything is fun and smooth until 53 stars. (Level 53?) It's not the end yet,  but it's now almost impossible to get new stars. Furthermore, the currency is so worthless at this point that it's really hard to buy further upgrades. How about allowing unused nuts to become currency at the end of each map? I don't want to keep running the same maps grinding out money to update something insignificant. Without doing so, you'll never get to the true upgrades that will help you progress.Games don't have to last forever. Artificially preventing me from completing a game by forcing me to grind is not the same as actually building in more hours worth of content. I stopped playing Final Fantasy for just this reason. Let's not pretend this is a good idea.The game is fun and worth the money I paid for it. The only thing lacking is my sense of accomplishment from finishing the game.

You have a lot to worry about on each level, and the tower abilities are very diverse.  You don't sit in one place like you would in most tower defense games.  You move from point A to point B.  Your goal is to get to the end of each level as quickly as possible with all your cargo intact.  Trust me, it's a challenge!The production quality is very high.  The dialogue is fully voiced and voiced very well.  The story can be skipped at all times, so you won't be annoyed by anything story-related.  The menu design is very pretty and easy to navigate.  The space backdrops are a little bland, but the ships are all unique layouts which offer a variety of challenges for tower placement.There are a few caveats to this tower defense design.  Firstly, I hate the limited space on early levels.  You can't do much with your later tower unlockables on the early stages, so you won't want to replay them.  The later levels offer larger ship layouts which allow for much more choice of where to put your towers and cargo.  Secondly, I unlocked all the towers and abilities way too soon in the game.  I ran out of things to do before I even got to the final level.  I never beat this game because I got bored of it and just wanted to quit due to the lack of late game content.  It doesn't help matters that the later levels are extremely hectic and actually lag a little bit from all the ships coming into the view at the same time.  I wish the game engine was a little faster and better optimized for the massive ship-versus-ship-versus-ship-versus-etc battles.  Ultimately, I decided to quit once the game crashed at the end of a very hard level.  I decided I was done.  That said, I had already enjoyed the game for about 12 hours, so I got my money's worth."

Since you just spent all your money on engines to get 5 stars you now can't build any guns on that side, so you just have to take it like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and deal with only getting 3/4 stars from having half your ship blown up, or just restart the mission.Still, it's a fun reverse TD/strategy game.

This is the next level of Indie games.In space run you are given the task of making it from point A to point B, you fly a space ship holding valuable cargo and it must make its way to base via a route as quick as possible, this basicly means youre flying in the face of danger. Worry not, for your tools against imminent doom are plentiful. As you fly, topspeed, you must find a balance betwen speed, survival and offence using resources gained in the heat of battle to build extra engines, turrets and other spaceship goodies.The game has the basic addictive tenets of most tower defense games, but suffers slightly less replayability since its basic premise is to complete a combative time-trial, meaning that there is no ""endless mode"" as is for most tower defense games, and yes this is a tower defense game. Although space ships are involved, your ships ""movement"" is a direct path orchestrated by your cargo supplier in each mission, and your opponents invariably show up to lay the hurt on you.The intesting extra twist that makes this game fun is that you are not protecting a base,but rather, you ARE the base. As you take damage your cargo gets destroyed and your ship gets dismantled, that means your reward and rank for completing the mission goes down and the space you have to build stuff shrinks. Furthermore, because youre on the clock, bunkering down is not a valid tactic, you need to go fast enough to complete the mission (with extra rewards for accomplishing it post-haste) and you need to be tough enough to survive attacks (and preferably kill the attackers to harvest their loot, lest you become too starved for cash to survive against the ever tougher enemies).I highly reccomend this game to fans of RTS, TD , Strategy games and Indie games in general."

A combination of a Tower Defense style with some additional strategy added into the mix. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I decided to give it a shot and it is certainly worth the price tag. As I am progressing through the levels I find myself needing to go back and redo levels to get better scores and achievements. You have the ability to upgrade your ships abilities and turrets whether it be a more defensive approach or just all out offensive. This is definitely something I can see providing hours and hours of a good time.The learning curve is quite small. After a couple levels it was easy to catch on and it throws you right into the mix which is very enjoyable rather than a long drawn out tutorial. There is some relatively comedic banter between the android on your ship and others that offer you jobs as well as your characters random one liners. All in all it's a pretty good looking product with a lot of potential for multiple play throughs of each of the levels whether it be making sure you deliver all the cargo without any losses, to trying to get the quickest delivery to get the higher reputation score. The reputation equates to unlocking more levels. More levels mean that you have so many new ship designs which keep you on your toes when it comes to the placement of your turrets.Thumbs up. I definitely recommend giving this one a shot."

I have not beat the game but have played quite a few levels and bosses.What it isIt's a typical get from point A to point B type of game. There is a backstory involved. You have to protect your cargo from all of the enemies space throws at you as well asteroids, other ships, and bosses.StoryNot much to speak of here. It's mainly there just to supply a context as to why you are transporting the cargo across the galaxy. There are factions that you work for to transport different types of cargo or people. It's very short and to the point, the clear focus is on the gameplay with this one and not so much the story.AudioWell it's voice acted, nothing mind blowing but it gets the job done. The sounds are typical SCI FI sounds. Some Pew Pew, rocket thrusters when you put them on your ship, and explosions when appropriate.GAMEPLAYHere's the important section. First off, this game DOES NOT hold your hand for long. You will die and die some more before you get the right combination and strategy to beat the numerous levels and bosses. It's very fastpaced and click intensive at times. If you don't move your guns fast enough or point them in the right direction quickly then it can easily be a game over.I really like the gameplay, if you are someone that can't take failure well then you might want to move on. I like the challenge and it requires alot of management. If your gun you just purchased is facing the wrong way and you can't reorient it, then you have a useless gun.Overall I really enjoy the game play, you have to strategize correctly. That includes where you place your cargo, where you put your thrusters, guns, missiles, shields, generators, etc. Your ship will get very large and will take alot of critical thinking to utilize the space available on your ship to win. If there is a smoking gun, easy mode skill that makes the game easier I have not discovered it yet and hope there isn't one.RATING7.5/10- They could have improved the story, maybe something that you could be invested in. It seems to be just there to support WHY your guy is speeding through the galaxy. IN a game like this it would be awesome if we had a way to create levels for each other that would challenge even the best players. Another hit on them is the ship is stationary in your lane. It would be great if we could move the ship around the lane to potentially avoid enemy fire or asteroids. Choosing between reorienting that gun, adding another thruster, repairing your missile launcher, OR moving your ship around the lane in an already fluid environment would be great and add in another element to choose from.TL;DR: 7.5/10 I would reccommend this game. Most of my complaints have nothing to do with the developers obvious purpose with the game, the GAMEPLAY itself. They definitely succeeded there, but I feel like they could have accomplished alot more to add new elements to the game and increase its logevity."

However since you can just redo a run in a couple of minutes in between other things the grind is dispersed.  Not sure of the longevity but regretting the purchase."

Because you don't know what locations are important, you don't know what to do without restarting, and you need to restart to get a better score, and need a better score to get better equipment, and need better equipment to do better on levels. It gets grindy fast, esp for a pay-to-own game."

,Recommended,275670,15628844,"Posted: 30 April, 2015",all,MrM,"Tower Defense game that puts you as the player under more preassure than ever before. No pause button (which is good for this game, imo!) and a lot of towers with skills you can activate (and on harder difficulties MUST activate). If you, like me, got tired of tower defense games where you just built tower and watched the action - you'll love this game as it requires you to be active at all times. This is NOT a TD game where  you play with one hand and drink coffee with the other.Some levels can require a bit of trial and error, and learn where the (most dangerous) enemies come from but I personally don't have a problem with that. The levels ain't that long, and every minute is fun to play. I really, really loved every minute of perfecting levels. It's not just about placements, it's also how fast you perform your action.I'd call this game ""The Dark Souls of Tower Defense games"", if you enjoyed Dark Souls, you enjoy action and you enjoy tower defense - pick this game up for sure!"

,Recommended,275670,30046873,Posted: 19 February,all,Linkblade,"Very cool unique Tower Defense game!Different to other TD's your fort is not fixes but moves! You play as Buck Mann and have to deliver the cargo of customers to earn space credit.Every level you have to place different amount and type of cargo. There are a bunch of different cargos which have different place usage, properties and even abilities.Every level you fly with a different shaped ship, so that you have to change the way you place your towers.I like how every tower has unique and upgradable abilities you need to activate in order to get the advantage.You are occupied almost full time building towers and activating abilities to adapt to the attackers type, amount, incoming directions.The story is very flat since the dialogues are always the same:Customer: Would you transport my cargo?Buck Mann: Yep.Forewarning Space Pirate: Will you give me your cargo?Buck Mann: Nope.It's quite difficult to win, so you take several restarts for every level adapting your build order, tower types and building places for each level. This is a small downside of the game, because the required thing to win a level is not completely skill but knowledge of the level, which is only aquired with several restarts. This is a bit of time waste. But still it's a very good game! I like it because it has refreshing new and deep game mechanics!"

,Recommended,275670,31084412,Posted: 11 April,all,Zed,"An excellent take on the tower defense genre where you transport cargo on an interplanetary starship and defend against pirates, asteroids, etc. A cool theme, nice sense of humor, and aesthetic that does the job. Not a whole lot to complain about.Many of the critical reviews argue that the lack of a battle pause function to detracts from the game, but once you get used to playing it in real-time it really isn't necessary in my opinion. Especially considering every level is identical on repeat and are not overly long. If you fail on a harder mission you can easily simply repeat it and use your knowledge from the previous run to preempt your demise.Avoid the sequel.4/5"

Instead you build a Spaceship which you have to defend. It totally does not feel like ordinary tower defende.Since the release they improved the controls (tower reposition). Some Release-Reviews may be outdated becauso of that.  Some other guys complained about the fact that the game can be hectic sometimes.The Game offers:- 30 missions- defending a space ship with shields, generators, turrets and engines- destroying gigantic asteroids, civil ships, pirat ships- destroying pirat bosses- optional targets: max. 5 stars(fame/renown/reputation points) per mission rewarding a perfect delivery- hectic gameplay in advanced missions- repostion the turrets and use special abilities of other towers, once they are unlocked- english dubbed dialogues, various subtitle-languages- at least 9h play time. The game took me 15h to complete without collecting all 150 stars/fameWhat I like about the game- hectic / fast paced strategy in advanced missions. You have some time to think, but mircomanagment is important.- new way of tower defense- ease to control with mouse. Optional Hotkeys are availableI don´t like about the game:- surprising long loading screen (30s-50s) if you launch the game"

,Recommended,275670,30280358,Posted: 2 March,all,Orlendis,"This game was amazing. Took me about 26 hours to 100% it, but it has so much replay value. You could do the missions over and over again building your ship so many different ways. Not quite a turret defense game based on the typical style of it, but still a turret defense game. Only difference is instead of everything being stationary and waves of enemies come in; in this game, your whole ship is flying through space and you need to defeat different types of enemies with different types of turrets and towers, in order to deliver each shipment successfully. As well as some other side objectives from time to time too. Your ship changes shape in every single level, so you have to constantly adapt to making a different setup every mission, no monotony here! I really hope they come out with Space Run 2 someday, because this game was just awesome!Keep in mind though, if you are looking for a traditional style TD game, this isn't it. This is more of a you're surrounded by enemies and obstacles and you need to blast your way through it kind of TD."

It's a frantic tower defense game, with an excellent stream of interesting upgrades.The design layout is a definite strength of this game over other genres.  Your strategy is dominated not only by what you build and when, but by where you place your buildings in relation to each other.  Building require power, and taking space to add additional power unlocks new abilities.My only quibble with the game is that sometimes the game gets too frantic and I find myself wishing for a while to slow the game down or pause while I make placements and activate abilities.I'm also hoping to see additional maps, or a set of random maps / ship sizes (maybe a map of the week?)"

They only exist in still images during story drops.GameplayNot a typical tower defense, its more akin to a puzzle game with a towr defense theme. There ARE different ways of beating each mission in terms of tower setup, but its usually a difference of beating them into a pulp, or barely reaching the end. There is a lot of trial and error, especially if going for 5 stars.ConsGameplayIt can get frustrating mid-late game when you're grinding for 5 stars on each level.Upgrades tend to be active upgrades, rather than passive damage boosts (etc), so many of them feel a bit useless.Lots of micro managing in the late game, this CAN be fun, but I put it in cons because a lot of people are fussy lol.You don't get to customize the size/shape of your ship for each mission, nor does it grow as missions progress. This is where the puzzle element becomes more apparent, since your ship design is preset for each mission. Instead you can customize the layout of the starting components that are mission specific (fuel tanks, observation rooms, etc.)StoryNot really a con, but if you're looking for a deep narrative, it isn't here. It's a lighthearted comedy.Overall:If you like TD's, or puzzle games, you'll probably like this, the more conservative you are, you might want to wait for a sale tho."
