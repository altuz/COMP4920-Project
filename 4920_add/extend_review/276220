The dogs need feeding alot and cleaning the house is so time waisting. You sit and stare at your dog for ages. Don't get it, Not entertaining AT all. A complete waist of your money."

I've played a lot of bad animal games that were enjoyable. But this one... It's really bad, even for kids. Hell, it's kind of upsetting how some people think that you can put little to no effort in child's game and still feel fine about it.The backgrounds are ugly and motionless. Dogs and cats sometimes just freeze after an animation and stare into the abyss with dead eyes. Gameplay is repetetive and BORING AS HELL. You can unlock some new features, like tricks or places to go to, but they're all not that interesting and they don't change almost anything. For example, you can unlock the forest area and take your pet for a walk, but there's absolutely no point in doing that. There's nothing to do there, nothing to explore or just look at, and your character is painfully slow.To sum up, this game is pretty harmless, so if you really want to spend your money on something silly, you can. But you'll be better off saving it for same better animal games. Or, I don't know, a cupcake. Cupcakes are always good."

The graphics are ugly and look like they came out of a Nintendo 64, it's impossible to keep your pet's needs satisfied and the game is endlessly repetitive. I strongly recommend you skip this game and find a better one to play."

,Recommended,276220,9726720,"Posted: 4 April, 2014",all,skep17,"Definitely one of the best games of all time. This game is truly a masterpiece, and I think it's a huge landmark in the history of video gaming. The graphics in this game are way beyond anything that comes out nowadays, and the gameplay is incredible. This really feels like a simulator, and it's so good that sometimes I feel like I can touch the cats and dogs in this game. This game should be sold for way more than £4.79, the developer really deserves it. 10/10, this game is perfect."

Gaming is one of the biggest markets among kids, teens, adults and even seniors. There are games pouring out each and every day, but there are so many choices. This game is the only choice you should have to make, My Best Friends: Cats & Dogs is a masterpiece. From the second I entered the game, my body tingled with excitement as if it was my 8th Christmas. You're met with the amazing music, so delightful you could've sworn  it was composed by Beethoven. Never have I seen such good graphics, it's as if I was playing it in real life. This game is the definition of immersion. You get the choice of being a boy and girl, and I chose the boy. I got a choice of about 5 entire outfits, it's just like real life. My eyes started tearing as I hit that green ""Ok"" button to advance forward in what shall soon be known as ""GAMING"". This game is all you need. I picked the cute brown dog, I got to name it whatever I wanted and it still amazes me to this day how there are so many choices, so much to explore. The possiblities are endless, should I name my dog Henry, or perhaps Sylvia? All I know is that this game has changed my life, before I woke up every day as a boy, but since I have played Cats & Dogs: Best Friends. I have woken as a MAN. This game is not a game, it is an experience, a religious one at that. You get to scrub the dirt off your dog in a bath, you get to feed it a choice of either basic food or oily and healthy food, you get to let it sleep for THREE or SIX hours or even a day! After your dog feels happy, you get to take it outside and suddenly the game turns into a top down perspective, wow! I am amazed! This game does it all! I walked myself over and begun teaching my dog tricks, I taught him to stand, lay down and EVEN ROLL OVER! I was shaking with excitement as my heart pounded. I was delighted. I advanced to ""catch"", where it turned into a side scroller! WOW! I threw the ball very far and this dog ran vigorously and hard through the dirt and grass and caught that ball, he was tired afterwards though, so we teleported home and went to sleep. As I explored all the activities, I was just amazed. This game must of taken years to develop. This was when I realized that this isn't an experience. It is art.My Best Friends: Cats & Dogs is the best game I have ever played, the graphics are beautiful, there is so much immersion, tons of activities and tons of happiness. Games are sometimes re released as ""Game of the Year"" edition.This game needs to be released asGame of the century.5 stars."

You will learn to yell and scream at your pet as they suck all your hard earnd golden coins away. You will also keep your pets prisoner inside of your poorly upkept pet prison in which you can never play with your pet. *if you call petting playing* Although this game may have a few downsides, Like the ability to not clean the litterbox which i really was dissapointed about. I really just wanted to pick some♥♥♥♥♥♥up! I still would suggest you get this game."

And that's a nice feature. And there are even contests at on Sundays. 99 cents are worth it. When I was young this was 20 €.
