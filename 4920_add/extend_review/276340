,Recommended,276340,10514695,"Posted: 18 June, 2014",all,cocoaprints,"If you are looking for a well rounded horse game, then this is a *very* well rounded horse game. It covers many aspects of horse life that other games do not usually include. These aspects include, but not limited to, horse riding, horse caring (beyond just cleaning and feeding), training, working with multiple horses, breeding and selling said horses, and running a profitable stable yard (where guests can rent your horses).It takes a realistic approach to horses where it can while keeping in perspective that it is still a game. Some of these realities are the fact that your horse does get tired if run for too long, can get stressed, and even sick if not properly taken care of.The in-game books (used for increasing skill levels) are not limited to in-game information, but rather information on the game's aspects in general, such as actual horse care, behavior to be taken when caring for a foal, etc.As far as the technical aspects of the game goes, there are many positives. The graphics are not as realistic as most modern games, however, what it does have is beautiful. The controls are extremely simple, even if the concepts of the game are more for children 8+. The game restricts the player to an ""8 hour day"" where it will auto-save at the end of said day, so no night rides.I would recommend this game for children 8+ and can go as high as teens to twenties. Definitely a fun, well rounded game for children and adults of all ages."

She started playing and I was amazed at how excited and happy this game was making her, so I purchased it for myself too. I am usually the kind of guy who plays RPG's and Resident Evil like horror games and so this is really not the kind of game I would usually go for. After 10 minutes of playing though, I was hooked!This is a wonderful game that touches on many aspects of owning a horse in real life, and most of all it relies on teaching you how to manage your time. The horses are animated beautifully, and in my honest opinion the horse models are much better than much recent and bigger budget games like The Elder Scrolls Online, or Lord of the Rings Online. Some of the mini games are very fun to play too, like cleaning the horses hooves or hosing them down. I have found myself addicted to this game in a very short amount of time!I would recommend this game to anyone who has a passing interest in horses, and also to anyone who just simply enjoys simulator style games as the main story mode has you rebuilding your business by training and selling horses.Considering I had never previously heard of this game, nor even the company who made it, I honestly believe that this game deserves a 10/10 for playability and value for money."
,Recommended,276340,13233597,"Posted: 4 December, 2014",all,Zhuria,"It's not bad. I've played many horse games over the years, and this is one of the best. That said, even the best wasn't that great. It might just be that I'm picky, though. It IS the best horse game currently on Steam, in my opinion.Note that this review is from the POV of an equestrian, and is probably best targeted at someone similar. This is mostly me being picky.Things I like:- I like that you can lead your horse. It takes goddamn forever, but I recently realized I could speed up the game (hotkey 1 to speed up/slow down) while leading my horse or doing other similarly slow tasks to speed them up.- I like the upgrades to the facilities even though it's slightly linear as to what you can do, and when- I like the animations, which are very good compared to many other games with horses in (though not necessarily horse games)- I like the riding activity. I've only got the first field unlocked, but it's nice, and I like that there are bonus points scattered around for you to find.Things I don't like:- You can tell whoever they hired is not totally on the up-and-up on all things horses. This list is primarily going to revolve around that.- Lunging foals that look like they haven't even been weaned? And on tiny circles? If you did that in real life you'd have a broke♥♥♥♥♥(and not in the good way) horse within a year. Their joints would just disintegrate (not a technical term) with the stress.- There are only three breeds. Hanoverian, Friesian and Andalusian. Not bad breeds, but who the hell's idea was it to put Friesians in the game? Friesians only come in solid black, in reality. It's kind of their thing. In this game, they can come in any damn colour. NO. NOT RIGHT. WRONG. D: Hanoverians and Andalusians do not come in cream, either. Totally inaccurate. Not even close. They could have improved the realism tenfold just by adding a few more breeds, making them actually look like those breeds, and STICKING TO REALITY. Having a gray (white), palomino or spotty Friesian is the equivalent of having a purple polkadotted pony. It's not possible.- Only being able to gallop over jumps, when in reality you want to NOT speed over jumps, usually. That's how you break legs.- Lack of show jumping or dressage. The best horse game I ever played incorporated all three branches of eventing. Sadly, it lacked in other areas. I have yet to find one that hits every note."
,Recommended,276340,14005937,"Posted: 15 January, 2015",all,TheWife,"As an avid equestrian since childhood, I have played several horse games, and this is by far the best one I've ever played. One of the most impressive points for me was the riding. It's not perfect, but the horses look better than in any other horse game I've played. Their gaits look realistic and when you turn them while trotting or cantering their heads actually look pretty. Their legs don't look all wonky and weird. The riding controls are very simple- click the left mouse button to speed up and the right to slow down. You don't have to make the horse jump yourself, but you do have to set them up right for it by taking them straight at it (most of the time, sometimes they jump at crazy angles) or the will refuse the jump. There are so may aspects of horse care (grooming, bathing, picking hooves, massaging), growing your farm (building a training facility, therapy center, guest house, and breeding center), and riding and competing ( There are 3 races in each area. The areas are the field, forest, and mountains). It is a very involved game with more goals than simply competing and brushing your horse. You earn money by training foals, massaging client's horses, breeding foals for clients, and booking guests. You can also breed your own foals and sell them. You can buy 3 different types of feed, supplements, a general vaccine, and a myriad of other medications to cure your horse of ailments (you'd only need them if you didn't keep your horses' health up, and it's very easy to keep them healthy). You can also buy show coats, boots, saddles, casual clothing, and books (which increase the amount of money you earn for each activity). Your focus it to achieve the next star rating by meeting all of the requirments for each level. It is very addictive and very fun!"

The more skills the horse gets, the more races will become available. The races itself are pretty simple, since the horse jumps himself. The only thing the player needs to do is make sure the speed is good enough, and that the horse won't run out of breath.Later on you can earn money with training foals for others. Make sure you always have 3 carrots from the garden with you, and after the foal did 3 good things, give it a carrot. Else it will get bored, and will start to disbey you.With the money you can upgrade/renovate buildings, buy new horses, clothing or items. This game is only €4,- so don't expect too much out of it. But I do find it a nice game to have you entertained for a couple of hours."

76561198077658772,Recommended,276340,12638204,"Posted: 26 October, 2014",all,Ansari,"This is a silly little game that takes itself far too seriously.For a game that pretends to be plot-driven it has a total lack of urgency about itself which is actually kind of nice.  It gives you a series of instructions to complete ‘when you feel like it’ and turns you loose.  It lets you get your feet without pressuring you overmuch… but it’s also not challenging.  You learn to feel for how much time your tasks take and plan around them, you learn where everything is so you don’t waste time going back and forth and back again because you forgot to do something in one area earlier.  (Eventually. The map’s not very easy to read.)The HUD’s pretty awkward to manage too. There’s a function where if you click a certain button it’ll bring up your current attributes, and if you walk near a horse it’ll show the horse’s stats.  The only problem with this is that it takes up half the screen and doesn’t show anything relevant about the yard – the horse section’s pretty good, but having the human one show how much feed you had, the overall dirtiness of the stable/horses in the stable/tasks completed for the day would actually have been useful. I can think of like six ways off the top of my head that could have been implemented better.The minigames are dull and unrealistic in terms of actual horse activities. I won’t bicker too much about them as I realise there’s a limit to coding, but there’s a hell of a lot more involved in foal training than making it walk in a circle, and I’m BORED.  It’s kind of like level grinding in terms of boring and pointless.  And the less said about the breeding mechanics, the better, though I suppose for a beginner it would be more than enough.  It’s certainly interesting… Let’s just say the system isn’t based on genetics as I know it and leave it at that.The controls are clunky and unintuitive, but they’re not *broken* or anything.  You’ll spend about half an hour cursing out your monitor every time they introduce something new and then you’ll get the hang of it, still mumbling occasionally about how idiotic the control scheme is. I have never before wished with such fervour that a game had been made aware of the WASD system.It doesn’t help that the game isn’t very good at explaining what it wants you to do, though, and isn’t always that good at responding even when you are using the right combination of keystrokes, though maybe that’s just my keyboard.  Protip: when the game tells you how to do something, take it with a grain of salt, and experiment, because chances are it forgot to tell you how to do B and C while vaguely instructing you on how to do A.The soundtrack is uninspired and highly repetitive but at least not catchy enough to drive me crazy. I turned the music off and played my own for background.  In another case of being somewhere in the middle of the scale the graphics aren’t cutting-edge but they aren’t hideous either.  I have some issues with the horse movement models they use, but again, it’s functional. There’s *some* customisation available for your avatar and horse, but not much. Coat colours and patterns are limited and use terminology that makes my head hurt with its inaccuracy, but it’s a kid’s game, so I can cope.And frankly when I bought this that was what I wanted.  A silly game that didn’t ask too much of me while still managing to be interesting enough that I could kill a few hours when I got bored with studying.  This fits the bill.  It’s not amazing, but it’s playable.  If you’re thinking of buying it, go watch someone playing it on youtube for half an hour or so – that will pretty much tell you if it’s what you’re after or not.  If I was recommending it to someone my age, i.e. an actual adult, I’d give it a 4/10, but for a kid twelve or under it’s a 6 if they're horse-crazy.  It’s not great but it’ll keep them amused for a while."
76561198108168219,Not Recommended,276340,22819162,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,Intrigue,"Love the idea of ithis game. Don't love the actual gameplay so far. Graphics and sound are wonderful but when you start out, you have to train foals in order to earn money. So if you fail at foal training then you can't buy anything. Like horse food. So your starter horse will get hungry and sick. You can't do anything with a sick horse except maybe brush and rename it. You won't be able to afford medicine or a new horse. Plus you won't be able to upgrade anything - which prevents you from being able to try earn income in other ways. If the foal training was a bit easier or if it wasn't the sole source of daily income for a beginner, that would improve theis game a lot. If there were sources of food to be found around the ranch - visit a fruit tree while out riding or add a little match 3 minigame or let us actually farm that garden behind the house or something - that could also be very helpful both in making the game more survivable and making it more fun.Edit:Gave this game a second chance more recently. Made it a little further, after much struggle. Managed to open the horse massage center. Had really, really hoped that it would be more fun and profitable than the foal training. It wasn't. Clients want you to completely finish each massage in under a minute. No wonder their horses are stressed out, huh?  So yeah. Unless there are some drastic changes to how income can be earned, am done with this game.As it is... If you'e looking for a challenging time management game that just happens to have a horse theme, maybe this could work for you. But if you were hoping - like me - for more of a ""relax, explore and build with your virtual pet"" type title, this isn't it."

I'm not a huge fan of playing games with bad quality, but this game really impressed me, it has a great storyline and you can do a lot of things, such as taking part on cross-country competitions and as the mayor objective, you have to rebuild an old stable.PROS:- Great animations;- You can choose between a lot of horse colours;- You can lead your horse around which is a thing that you don't see a lot on horse games;- There are several challenges you have to complete in order to upgrade your stable.CONS:- All the things you have to build are pretty expensive;- You don't have much options for clothing when you first create your character.- Any of the horses for sale are different than the ones you can create when you start your game.- For some challenges, such as keeping your horse groomed, will lower your stable's level if you don't keep cleaning your horse or doing whatever the task asks."

With open riding and a wider variety of horse and farm maintenance, this game far exceeded my expectations. The only negative thing that I can say about it, for me at least, was that I didn't know how the star level worked, but I found the game's manual so that cleared it up. Plus, after 20 hours, I lost all my saves... but it's not the game's problem, just my computer's. But yeah, you should get it.

76561198141981004,Not Recommended,276340,29390708,Posted: 20 January,all,Teager,"This game is too heavy on the tedium and too lacking in instruction and enjoyment.It expects you to spend WAY too much time cleaning hooves, grooming, walking your horse slowly from place to place, etc. When riding your horse in the field, your horse runs out of energy after just a few minutes - not enough time to get from one side of the field to the other, and when you're finished you need to slowly walk the horse back to its stall, put it away, then walk the saddle back to the saddle rack, then walk back to your house to reset the day. OR you can take the more time consuming option of walking to the feed bin to fill a bucket of feed, walking to the horse's stall to dump it in the horse's feed bucket, walking your empty bucket BACK to the feed bins to put it away, and waiting for your horse to finish eating.It took me WAY too long to figure out how to actually ride my horse. Despite having a ""saddle horse"" option on the horse's stall, and a ""mount"" option when you're leading the horse, you have to actually put the horse back in its stall, walk over to the saddle rack, pick up a saddle, walk it to the stall, then you can finally use the saddle horse option. But then you're left leading your horse, not on top of it, and the mount option doesn't work. So you need to walk your horse out of the barn to mount up.The controls are very poorly done as well; the game shows you to click left mouse to move. I assumed that, like most games that use left mouse movement, this meant you click where you want your avatar to walk and spent a minute or two scooting and rotating in place before I realized you need to actually click and hold the left mouse button. When you stop holding the left mouse, you stop moving. This is poor design for accessibility: rough if you happen to have carpal tunnel or a similar condition.I played this game for an hour and a half and wasn't able to complete the first major goal of ""achieving a one star rating"". Most of my time playing was spent walking back and forth between the various chores the game asks you to do, with none of the quality of life improvements you might expect (such as, for example, putting you on your horse after you saddle, putting your saddle away for you when you dismount, putting your bucket back for you after feeding).If you're really into doing tedious chores - and as a horse owner, I can assure you they are far more tedious in this game than they are in real life - then this game is for you. If you're looking for a game that's actually fun, this isn't it. Even if this game was aiming for high realism, a game needs an element of enjoyment to keep people playing. If you expect users to play for over an hour and a half to get to the part that's supposed to be fun (assuming it exists), you should consider revisiting the design and planning stage."
