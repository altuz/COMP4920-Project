Think of it less as a fancy chess game and more of an analysis tool for chess enthusiasts.Every single bad review you'll see for this program is due, not to some defect or bug, but because this is a bloody complex application and it's rather hard to intuit what it is you want to do. Reading through the manual, especially if something doesn't seem to make sense, is highly, *highly* recommended.  If you just want to play chess, and nothing else, you'd be better served by the pack-in games that come with your operating system. The Fritz engine that comes with this software has a low end rating in the 1400s and is absolutely /not/ for beginners!So what can you use this for? The killer feature for me is the ability to load up PGN-formatted games (I usually annotate them on my phone) and have the engine go through your game and note where and how you messed up. What you could have done better, and so on, using plain english.This is starting to sound like a sales pitch, but in short, I recommend this whole-heartedly if you have more than a passing interest in chess."

Fritz 11 SE seems to be the only engine included. The advertised Fritz 14 engine appear to be missing.I know Chessbase since 20+ years and expect them to fix the problem.For now, view this as Early Access.Update: Looks like the Fritz 14 engine is now available though it did not install automatically."
76561198057638139,Recommended,276750,15151923,"Posted: 1 April, 2015",all,Hollowmoosekey,"So far, I am very much enjoying Fritz Chess 14. While I'd like to consider myself a decent Chess player, I admit I still have much to learn of the game, such as end game calculations, mass attack and defense strategies, and how to not accidentally spill coffee on my chessboard while I play.Although I haven't found any tools or tips for coffee related checkmates, (Coffee Temperature Gauge, Player Motor Skills vs. Reaction Timing Graph, Coffee Cup Center of Gravity Chart, Coffee Stain Probability Meter, Estimated Remaining Time of Cleanup, etc.) I believe this program is a substantial learning and teaching tool.In essence, this software is great for improving your game and playing techniques, or even teaching them if you enjoy being a Chess tutor. While you can indeed play a simple game of Chess with Fritz 14, it offers a great deal more than that, from multimedia files that explain the rules of the game as well as rated and timed matches, to differing analysis tools that suggest blunders, better moves and checkmate threats, to even more tools including subtle hints and showing every single possible move and the advantages and disadvantages of each.I would like to warn potential buyers of Fritz 14, it can be very complex and intimidating to learn all of the programs offerings. I'm not questioning intelligence here but rather pointing out that Fritz 14 truly does go the distance in terms of analysis tools and options, and the time it may take to learn them can frustrate and be off-putting. However, in my opinion, once you learn how it all functions and how you can best use or customize the tools to your liking, it is that much more at your disposal. So, while figuring it all out can be an arduous task to master, I personally think it pays off in the long run, especially for anyone whom is seriously trying to learn and best the challenges that make Chess what it is.The core game offers several types of 2D and 3D boards, not a considerable amount, but a few. A player can customize the pieces of the set, the board color and style, as well as the background table the board is set on. This is also the first Chess program I've played that offers 3D opponents that can move the pieces with their hands. While I prefer a simpler 2D Chessboard myself, I find the 3D opponents to be an interesting concept, and I certainly appreciate creativity.From what I understand, the game also comes with a six month subscription to thePlayChess.comwebsite, which offers news, training, a dedicated server for online matches, and likely a good deal more, all revolving around, of course, Chess. I must admit I tend to be a very esoteric individual (I have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) and I have not played online. I would have to imagine the community atPlayChess.comis a positive, intelligent and friendly one, however, this is purely my own speculation. All I can honestly say is ""Multiplayer"" is not really my scene, so by all means, click the web link and check it out if you are interested.To conclude my review, I would personally recommend it happily to any player looking to go from being a good Chess player to a great one, from a hobby player to a pro player, or even an inexperienced player to a rather competent player. With patience and a bit of mindful dedication, this program offers a considerable deal of training content and much more. However, if you would rather simply enjoy a Chess game or two, there are much less complex, not to mention cheaper, alternatives to Fritz Chess 14.And I personally recommend caution with certain...malicious...cups of coffee.Good luck and happy gaming!"

Even once you figure out how to turn it down it can still be rough. Casual Chess players might get more out of the free program WinBoard, but for serious Chess players, this is where it's at. If you are considering joining an orginization like the US Chess Federation, or any kind of club player status, owning this software can be a major tool for analyzing past games you have played.Again, if you just want to play a bit of computer Chess, this may be a bit too beefy for you."

Included multimedia is aimed at beginners. Some more games commented by a stong player would be nice (remember the Karpov comments with (I think) chessmaster 3000?). The engine is still terribly strong for a measely human like me.It's still just Fritz - a strong program with nice database options - both for reference and for storing your own games.Is it a good buy? Well if you just want a chess program and a database then you should probably look at free options on the internet. But if you want to play atPlaychess.comand use their material then it looks like a good deal because of the 6 months included membership. Should you consider upgrading with the DLC for 'Deep Fritz'? - well are you a superstrong chess player? I'm not so I wont. In fact I'm very happy with the chance to get Fritz+playchess for a good price and I dont miss 'Deep multicore etc.' options.For reference I'm a ""hobby"" player with an Elo rating around 1900."

It's already installed so I just cancel the setup and the game starts just fine.I bought the game just to play against a strong player with handicap. But I am not able to do so as I want. When I play agains the engine with ""queen+move""-handicap, it plays fine, but when I castle, the engine expects white to play two moves in a row. After that, It's impossible to move pieces and I need to restart the game. Castling is only a issue in handicap-mode as it seems.The analysis works fine and you are able to include other engines easily.When the bugs are removed, I will update this review as well."
76561198065165378,Recommended,276750,13674878,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,wanderm,"Updating from Fritz 8 is perhaps unnecessary: the older version by and large does the same thing.  That said, I have not regretted purchasing Fritz 14 as I will try to establish below.The newer Chessbase-themed GUI is very nice, but the chief benefit is that it is easier to manoeuvre the database.   That in essence is the purpose of the Fritz chess suite: chess-playing software is ubiquitous and cheaper (and can play a stronger game: see the open-source multi-core Stockfish) but offering native Chessbase Reader (free) support along with plain-English analysis is of greater value for the serious chess student.In limited games, I've found the Fritz 14 engine to be stronger than the Fritz 8 engine (processing power held constant) but that wouldn't be important really unless I was GM-standard.Overall the cleaner interface wins the day.  Dispensing the CD-media to enable the Steam experience is also very convenient, and I look forward to taking my Fritz experience anywhere my light laptop can go."
76561197970827381,Recommended,276750,17312049,"Posted: 31 July, 2015",all,ChunkyMonkey,"This is a great software to run engines in, as well as the three engines included. This is also the only chess software that is available through Steam that takes itself seriously. So you don't have many options anyways. I bought this on Steam sale when it was $19.99 and $9.99 for ""64 bit dlc"".You probably would only use the latest Fritz 14 engine, so basically you get one good engine and two old ones. There is a ton of included games from history from all the famous players. They can be searched by all criteria like years, last names, etc. There are many analysis options. You can see suggested moves on the go or analyse the whole game. One nice feature is intentionally vaguely worded hints. They give enough descriptive advice but don't directly give you the best move. You have an option for exact moves though.While the core of the game is pretty good. But it is really puzzling how a known chess software maker can make a good engine and not take the effort to include more options in its main selling point which is the 2D and 3D representation of the chess board. You get very few options for the 2d chess board. There are nice wooden texture and tones included, but there are just five total! It doesn't even have the green and white traditional vinyl board colors that many players are used to. Doesn't have solid color options. You get too few chess graphics as well, and only 3 out of 5 are any good. The other two are abstract designs no one would use.The 3d chess board graphics look nice but they look like they've been made very lazily. For example you get a number of options for traditional 3d pieces and boards but they can only be combined with solid color background. You can adjust something as insignificant as lighitng and reflection, but don't get many texture options for the background. The themed 3d graphics with backgrounds are pretty good, but they're mainly for novice players. In my opinion the experienced players would not bother running these nice looking 3d graphics since they are used to plain 2d diagram.So basically I'd give it a 7 out of 10. You get lots of advanced options but not enough color and graphics variation. I'd even be willing to purchase additional ones as DLC if they were available. But there aren't any. Seems like such a missed opportunity to simply add more colors and graphics options. The only explanation I can think of is lazyness."

Clicking some of the buttons like the force fritz to move button do nothing in some of the training modes.  Really disappointed that I paid what i did for this.  I thought that I would be getting a quality product that could help me with my chess game but I did not.  Hopefully they fix some of these issues and add a tutorial.  If they did im sure I wouldn't be as disatisfied.

Can watch grandmasters games and all tournaments. 6 month playchess/chessbase subscription. Easy chess engine import and implementation. No brainer for anyone who loves to play chess.Cons: Tutorials are hidden and lacking in content . . . (find them in your ""C:\Users\[NAME]\Documents\ChessBase\Media files\"" folder. Crazy number of options with no documentation. Not really for beginners who wish to learn without playing online (but then again, the best way to learn how to play chess is to . . . play chess, not read books or tutorials).Overall, the cons are minimal and can be ignored. If someone wants to learn how to play chess, YouTube has a TON of free content. Fritz allows for amazing analysis of games, very large chess database (which is easily expandable via numerous file type support) and online kibbitzing with some of the best players on the planet.I highly recommend this for anyone who is serious about chess."

The mileage you get out of Fritz equals the amount of work you put into learning how to utilize its interface.  If you want a simple chess program that is both aestheticly pleasing and fun to play against there are better options than Fritz.  However, if you are looking for a robust program to analyze your chess games in minute detail, Fritz is perfect.The built in chess engines are moderately powerful and sufficient for most players.  Deep Fritz 14 is available as DLC if you want an engine that can fully utilize more powerful hardware.  There are also more powerful (and free) engines readily available online that plug into the Fritz GUI with little trouble.  I have personally been using Stockfish 5 and it has been working perfectly.If you want to improve your chess game there are few tools I have encountered more valuable than Fritz."

I learned how to play when I was 5. I have been playing casually since, off and on. Since my upgrade from wind 7, (I miss dearly, win 8 & 10 sucks), to 8, then to 10, I lost the standard programs that came with Win 7. Chess  program was one of them. It was simple and easy to play. I bought Fritz 14 due to the lack of any decent chess programs that I was coming/searching across/for. I purchased Fritz 14 and I am not happy with it. It is the most unfriendly interface that I have ever experienced. I can not figure out how to set up games against te computer. I barely able to get a game going against a human (Sending my moves via email to my bro in prison) via emal. I recieve his move via email and I move his piece. This is fine. He is the only one I play. There is so much junk, not explained, junk to me anyways, and it's worse than maze of tangled fishing line. I guess if you love chess, and you are not Einstein, find a simpler chess program. Believe me, this program is not user friendly, I have many, many hours of frustration, and always ends with giving up. Try again a month or so later, still frustrating. The help feature is really bad. You can only enter predermined questions and so you have to settle for a listing that's ""Close enough"" to what you are asking it. The answer is short vague, and not helpful. Not in my case so far. I have yet to figure how to start a game against the AI. Tons and tons of databases that does not make sence. I just want to play chess, I don't give a crap of games already played, especially by some one else, even if it was Einstien's game or not. Save your money, save your frustrations for something worth being frustrated over, and just settle for a simple, inexpensive chess program. I will have to search again for such. Win 7 version not compatible with win10. After all, check out the number of reviews on Fritz 14 (positive ones), sure, mostly positive, but they are all the Einstiens in the world, and they are only about 40 of them in existance. I am not one of them of course. ;op"

Human players I could beat them all in my area, and computers I would have serious matches against them and beat them as well, my Constellation Forte giving me a run for my money in 1990 when I beat it 4-2 but the score didn't reflect the actual chess.
