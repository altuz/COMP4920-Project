First off i am a huge fan of signal games, but like all hard-core toy soldiers fans, we saw the decline of customer loyalty starting with toy soldiers: complete. Toy soldiers: complete was a god aweful port from last gen consoles, bugged to hell, and was ""protected"" by the early access seal. By the time it was released on pc, all of the fans starting to buy big red ♥♥♥♥ing whistles because we knew something as wretched as this would be spewed from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of capitalist hell itself. As for this ""game"", its a piece of trash. It might as well be a MOBILE GAME. The first thing that stood out when i booted up the menu was that there was A SHOP! No complete, well made game ever in the history of man has had a ♥♥♥♥ing in menu shop where you can buy coins to unlock units and weapons for your army, that should have been unlocked in the first place or at least, by completing the campaign. Yet again, like mobile games. Instead of unlocking items by skill, you are subjected to a slot machine that randomly gives you upgrades etc. Or you can pay $5 to unlock the units and upgrades yourself. The textues on high, looks like they are from 2007.The gameplay itself is fun and engaging. Although, besides all the bad♥♥♥♥♥♥that is included in this grotesque, morsel of a game.   You ready? Dun dun dunnnn,,, The game is locked to 30fps! Jesus christ on a bicycle! Its borderline unplayable! Its only playable if you like to watch slidshows of the game you are playing.So overall, this game is a piece of digital garbage and is not worth your time of money in its current state. Not to demoralize you guys but signal doesnt like to patch or fix their games. *cough* *cough* Toy Soldiers complete. *cough*Clash of clans/10-IGN"

Now, hearing about a sequel to two of my favorite games with Assasin's Creed and G.I. Joe? I was pumped. Like, puking rainbows pumped.Then, I bought the game.It came a full day after the promised release date, was twice the price of the base game to buy a third of the game's total content, and immediately required me to install Uplay. These issues were hard to overlook, but I managed. After they'd dropped the ball out of the gate, Ubisoft threw Microtransactions at me. On a $30 game. The game has a 12 mission story, compared to it's predeccesors which both at least doubled that for 2/3 the price. The armies are just shy of retextures, and content for the game was unnervingly hard to find. I've requested a refund, despite my computer being left on for a day (mind you, I've spent maybe an hour and a half tops,) and I desperately hope I get it. Save yourself the trouble, and buy the last two games combined for a third the price."

Basically, some people re-made the original and thought they could do better.. but ended up doing worse.After playing Complete.. and then this.. your constantly thinking, this is worse but ok. But after awhile.. the worseness wears on you.. and you start getting bitter.. and your like.. DID THEY EVEN PLAY THE OLD GAME!?

Joe in. I'm still waiting, it's a buggy tedious piece of crap that is fugly as hell.Even though it took me 3 attempts at loading it to get to the main menu, freezes on the character select screen whilst it checks the uplay servers to see what characters you have brought, I can forgive that♥♥♥♥♥♥if it is fun but it isn't any more fun than any one of the countless free games out there.    Waves are long, numerous and repetitive even for a tower defence game, and the DLC armies which are the only reason to want this game, don't improve it enough.  There are hundreds of characters they could have used to man different placements but instead you spend most of your time controlling the greenshirts/cobra troopers in turrets/bunkers shooting the enemy canon fodder to unlock your special character which is the only reason you want to play the game.Maybe there's unlocks to speed it up as you play, I don't know, there is something super disappointing about this game, and I don't just mean the 30fps, sluggish mouse controls (use a joypad) and micro transactions.Just ignore the licences, it isn't a particularly good game anyway and is a waste of the G.I. Joe, Cobra & MOTU brands and those brands are why I was probably hoping for more.  I expect a lot of people will play it and be perfectly happy but I don't feel it does them justice and certainly doesn't do the price justice.In a few months when it is patched and on sale it could be a lot closer to a recommendation but for now I couldn't be bothered to try multiplayer as you only get a limited time to get a refund and that is exactly what I have done.  I just can't see them patching it to the extent I feel I got £25 worth of game."

I experianced long load times, microtransactions, and paid DLC that is part of the game. Each 'army' that you pick has it's own grind to get through. So if you like more than one army I guess you are investing a good amount of time just to get them leveled. The upgrades for each army are locked by microtransactions or in game currency and is all random. There are way too many problems with this game for it to have been released this year and they expect you to pay $15 for less than half the game."

If you are a fan of the last few toy soldiers you will love this one.Every army is simmilar enough that its not a challange to pick up another one off the bat but they all have a flavor that makes them worth playing and experamenting with (armys have different powers, strangths ect...)Now for the bad:Kill Uplay. For god sakes If I wanted to buy the game on Uplay I would. DRM protection is a joke, This game was up on the torrents within the first day of launch. All Uplay has done is create another problem for your normal buyer. Dump the platform.Forceing me to pay for DLC that is in game is horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ Day one 15 bucks worth of DLC is bull. I understand you need to make up for the licences (He man, GI Joe...). But passing that on to the buyer is poor practice in todays buissness. Make up some other armys, you can do it...*The game is not locked at 30 FPS anymore, it is now set to 60 after recent patch.When you make a port to PC, you dont get to just shove it in laughing to the bank. Make sure it works. Look at the system EA had going. Bad company practice WILL lead to lower profits and hire piracy rates. Respect your buyer and they will respect you.I never had a problem with GFX. Everything looked fine for me and my FPS was fne, but thats just me. Im sure others are not as lucky.Some myths:Some are saying that this game has micro transactions. The in game method of unlocking tower upgrades is threw an in game coinage. You beat levels and you get coins. Every time you win a level (or loss) you get free stuff and coins.You can pay to get coins but this is stupid. After I played the campain once I had all but one army fully unlocked without spending a cent in the micro store..In fact I did not know you could pay to get coins untill I found it on accident. Its Simply a way for the lazy asses to get ahead.Dont spend a cent on the ingame micro, Its exactly like the past games if you dont.Over all its a solid game. Not a work of art or ground brakeing but its still a solid game. If you love the past games, buy it. If you are unsure wait for it to be on sale. Id give it 7/10."

Biggest disappointment is when you get upgrades"" when your main character gains levels (not even sure levels do  anything outside of getting a ""box"" with 3 upgrades that are always duplicates). If you get a repeat upgrade - it turns into coins that you will already have too many of.Game just gets very stale very fast.  Very limited turrets / weapons choices.  Taking over your character is also limited. First you have to kill a lot of enemies consecutively to build a ""bar"" to allow you to release your commander.  But it's limited since it has to have ""battery power"". 90 or 60 seconds total.  The batteries(to gain additional time) are found on the field  to extend the ""play time"". These do not respawn and the levels where you can get high number of consecutive kills is limited.There is a customize army option that I assume is multiplayer only. If you are just looking for a towerdefense singleplayer - seems a lot of features may be useless."

The 30fps cap on SP has been lifted. The only thing I still have to do is try a co-op/MP game (those are still locked in 30fps as far as I know.)ORIGINAL: Honestly, Im finding this game to be a blast. The 30fps thing is a little annoying true, and certian resolutions don't show up correctly yet, but all those issues seem to fade away once the fun of Toy Soldiers starts ramping up. It takes a little bit to get used to the upgrade changes that are in place, but almost everything is obtainable through play progression. The microtransactions are only there if you want to speed things along. But then of course your just cheating yourself out of playing the game aren't you?All this being said if you didn't like TS before, you won't now. But if you did and are yearning for more TS action, give this one a look. You just might find yourself enjoying this a bit too much."

I have almost 4 hours on this game at the time of reviewing so already I feel that I am in a better position to review this game than people who have 0.5 hours in it and such.First I downloaded. I was expecting Uplay but it hadn't been installed since my latest format, so I sat there for the better part of 30 minutes while it installed. Once it did I tried to login. It had been a while so I sat there thinking of the passwords I normally use but none were correct. I was then locked out of Uplay because I had tried to login too much. Not being given an option to do anything about it, and the password reset not working at all, I went onto the website to try to send a support ticket and guess what? That's right, I couldn't access the site because I was locked out. ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious right? In the end I had to call, yes, call Ubisoft and ask them to do something. The guy was helpful despite me remarking about how terrible Uplay is, he even said ""We get a lot of complaints about Uplay."" He couldn't insult the company that employed him of course, nor would I expect him to, but it was funny none the less.""Can I help you with anything else today?"" He asked. ""Yes, please tell your bosses that Uplay is a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥and to please stop making us use it."" I laughed, he laughed and in a diplomatic tone said ""I will certainly pass that information over for you sir.""I digress. The game! So first impressions; what a crappy port! The resolution works fine of course but the menu feels quite akward, almost as if the game just had mouse support slapped in with a bit of digital tape. Still, it's not horrendous.I watched a Let's play video earlier of a guy reviewing it and he hit the roof when he saw the shop with microtransactions. Erm, mate? You can grind that money and it's really effin easy too. So scratch that as a con off of your list if you are thinking about this game. Microtransactions are purely for impatient/lazy people. They are not necessary!The framerate. Yes most people have an opinion of how choppy it feels being locked at 30fps. Well I didn't, it felt fine to me even on full graphics. I'm not going to say that people who are going on about that are snobs or anything, but it's no where near as jumpy as they make out. If it is, I would maybe suggest that it's their rigs...maybe lacking in ram or up to date drivers, I don't know. Update: Been playing for 11 hours now so far and not had a single problem with framerate. Just a bunch of snobs complaining about something which isn't even noticable then.I do have a couple of problems with the performance though: you can't alt+tab. Well you can, but if you do, the resolution will reset to default (1280x768 iirc). In this day and age, inexcusable. Also when I was doing the tutorial I was given these TINY icons on the screen telling me what key to press; so tiny that I couldn't see what it said. I'm assuming this is because the resolution was never meant to go that high on consoles and they just didn't bother to make the icons bigger to compensate... but otherwise the resolution is fine.So the gameplay. It's a tower defence game with toys. It's actually a lot of fun. The graphics are a little dated looking and the controls quite basic, but that's by no means a horrible thing. The gameplay is alot of fun. You can unlock upgrades and each army feels quite unique if not in it's options but in it's feel. Campaign seems only good if you want to unlock stuff but gets quite annoying later on. The weekly thing seems quite fun. I want to try co-op when I convince my friends to get it, but for now my experience is in single player.The controls are fine for the most part, but now and again you are given control of a map defined flying unit.... the controls are screwed for those and that needs to be fixed asap.It's a good game, despite it's shortcomings. I have read a post from a developer on another review saying how they are looking into the framerate cap, so they at least haven't given up on it. A few fixes here and there and it will be great. It's really up to you if you want to pay 25 pounds (or $30, whichever currency you use) for everything; You only really get half a game if you get the vanilla and not the hall of fame edition. It's really cheeky of them to do that but I still think this game is worth that price: providing they add some general fixes to make the game more PC friendly. The only real gripe is with Uplay. I hate it, it doesn't work well, slow, and it's just more unnecessary processing power with everything else I'm running"

A constant need to mind your funds as well as your turret condidtions and the past memories the toys bring. The Kaiser bringing back that old antique standup soldier style, Starbright's cutesy force reminding us of the old Care Bear and My Little Pony days, Phantom kicking our memories to the newer futuristic style that began to form, and the Dark Lord taking us back to the old evil magic boardgames. And as one of the dlc armies, GI Joe sparking that enjoyment of playing soldier and reminding us of that patriotic spark we had as kids. Oh the cartoons were great.This game has the same elements of its predecessors, with a few differences and additions that really get you to think about how to play, which turrets to put where, and how to spend your funds. And with separate leveling up stages between armies to unlock new upgrades for damage, range, and health (which can also be bought from the customizatoin menu if you have enough tokens) no two playthroughs are the same.You ask me, it's definitely worth buying."

Otherwise it seemed fun, after a hour of gameplay however, I began to wonder when the dlc content unlocks so I could play as cobra commander?It doesnt. The DLC for 90% of people flat out does not work, the system in place in the game for it to check with Uplay and confirm you are online and own it, is completely broken, so the content you paid for, cannot be used. I spent a hour troubleshooting this, and what is Ubisoft supports statement on this?""Contact steam and try to get a refund""They are so unwilling to fix their broken content, that they would rather lose a sale, than deal with it.

Not crazy about the DLC armies, but the fact that you can buy a ""complete"" version and not have to mess with that part is a MAJOR BONUS.

76561198078490119,Recommended,276770,21056816,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,StitchScout,"Introduction:I have played the other two Toy Soldier game(Xbox) and enjoyed them a lot. They were very close to perfect and the second one was a clear step forward for the series. Toy Soldier War Chest falls shorter than either of those games to perfection and I feel it doesn’t grow the series at all.General Thoughts:War Chest is a lot of fun it uses the formula that the other two games built but does do all that much different from the other two games. The hero mechanic has been expanded where you have a kill-streak like bar. As you get more kills in the turret that you’re using the bar will go up unlocking hero, vehicle, and then super weapon for you to use. Each race has unique turrets animations, models and has some slight differences in rate of fire and range. Heroes have unique and fun weapons but the dlc heroes don’t have as many as the base game heroes when it comes to weapons. Heroes also can’t jump this is a flaw and really should have been added. Other than those features the game plays the same as the other to titles in the franchise. It has weekly invasions(challenges) which are fun and will expand the gameplay slightly.The Bad:Having a sequel that doesn’t grow the franchise isn’t always bad if they improve what’s there. War Chest doesn’t, it plays like the other two but now heroes are harder to control. It’s annoying but not 100% bad when it comes to the hero’s controls although I would highly recommend a controller. The other two toy soldier’s games had a unique fun war theme with them. War Chest is fun but that war theme is no longer there really, so if you wanted that feeling you won’t find it here. There is a in game shop. This does have micro transactions, but you can unlock anything with coins you will earn in the game. You get the coins fairly and I feel they added just of those that are impatience with getting unlocks.The Good:It plays as well as the other two games(excluding heroes) with fun level design that will give you a challenge. It’s a fun game and you’re looking for a good tower defense game with some third-person components you will find it here. The upgrading for turrents have been sighlty improved now you can upgrade different parts individually. (range,damage,armor)The Meh:Uplay, it’s here, it isn’t as bad as I thought it would be. It took only about 5 minutes to set up and I have had no problem with it when in game. It does take a couple extra minutes for the game to start though. The menu is bare bones its only what you really need and not much else.Final thoughts:Even with its flaws it’s a fun and good game in the series. I would recommend it to you on sale. If you like tower defense games and need something to scratch that itch this will do it for you."

,Recommended,276770,19242249,"Posted: 23 November, 2015",all,Reverend Jesse V92,"Toy Soldiers War Chest is made by Signal Studios and published by Ubisoft; this means it uses UPlay, so if you have some kind of aversion to UPlay, be advised. The game also features a 60FPS cap because the game's physics are calculated via the frame rate.TSWC comes with 4 armies to play as by default:- Kaiser (WWI German Empire)- Phantom (Sci-Fi Space Marines)- Starbright (Fantasy Girls' Toys)- Dark Lord (DnD-esque RPG themed set)In addition, there is day-one DLC that adds up to four more armies:- GIJoe (1980s)- Cobra (1980s)- He-Man (1980s)- Assassin's CreedSignal really dropped the ball by not including Skeletor as a faction and instead including Assassin's Creed. Although I am sure the inclusion of the well-known Ubisoft franchise was purely a contractual obligation and I understand it.The game also features shortcut-micro transactions. While these optional payments may save you an hour or two of game play earning the in-game coins used to unlock turret upgrades, I cannot say it's worth it.The game play is much more solid than Signal's previous game, Toy Soldier: Cold War. Cold War is bundled with the original Toy Soldiers game in a port made by Chrome Studios; Signal had nothing to do with porting Complete to PC, so keep that in mind.Why is the game play better than TS:C? Let's start with the biggest game changer: The turret upgrades.In previous Toy Soldiers games, the turrets had only a level-1-2-3 upgrading system. In TS:WC the turrets now have three trees to upgrade: Attack, Defense, and Range. This allows the upgrades to be diversified.There are several types of turrets as well. These are based on the GIJoe army, but the turrets have the same archetypes across all 8 armies:- Anti-Infantry- Anti-Vehicle- Anti-Air- ArtilleryThe game features two different building pads, large and small. AA and artillery turrets can only be built on large pads, while anti-troop and anti-vehicle turrets can be built on any platform.The game also features a 'hero character' system which can be a game changing aspect.For instance, in the GI Joe set, after filling the kill points bar up to a certain level, you unlock the ability to play as the GI Joe character Duke, complete with screw holes and action figure joints. Duke has a few weapons, like an automatic rifle, a rocket launcher, and grenades. However, filling the bar more without using Duke will allow you to use the Dragonfly attack helicopter, which has machine guns and missile launchers. Filling the bar all the way allows you to call in a Skystriker bombing run. All the armies have their own unique hero units; Cobra has Cobra Commander and He-Man has the titular hero, and such.However, these hero units rely on batteries to use. The character and mid-tier vehicle use battery power, and the bar depletes over time. You can fill the bar by picking up the batteries scattered across the level, but these batteries are finite, leading to you being mostly dependent on your gun turrets. This is a smart move from a design perspective as the hero units can pretty much face roll all enemies on the playing field.So the turrets; at first, all the upgrades are locked. The first few levels as you first begin will be slightly challenging without the needed coins to unlock the upgrades. However, you earn a very large sum of coins in each level which can unlock one or two upgrades per-successful level completion, which means unlocking all the upgrades is just a matter of maybe an hour or two.The game measures your progress in 3 area, on a scale of bronze, silver, gold, platinum:- Aggression- Profits- Toybox healthAggression is how long you wait between waves. In order to obtain the platinum medal for aggression, you must skip the wave wait times on every wave almost instantly.Profits are how much resources/money you have leftover at the end of the level. This is also easy to get if you are frugal and don't mindlessly upgrade turrets. You can also earn more credits back by selling anti-air turrets after the final aircraft waves have finished.Toy box health is how much of the health of your base, or 'toy box' has left. In order to make platinum, the toy box MUST end the game with 100% health. In several levels, there are multiple toy boxes, which means you must cover all angles of attack.The main game's campaign does not feature the DLC armies; however, at certain points after playing through the campaign, you will unlock 'survival' levels that are based on the DLC armies. These survival levels are never-ending waves of enemies with increasing numbers. Even with a perfect defence, the turrets will take damage over time and will require repairs or they will be destroyed. It's a war of attrition, and it goes on as long as you are willing to put up a fight.- GI Joe Survival- Cobra Survival- He-Man Survival- Assassin's Creed SurvivalThe game has a randomly chosen 'Weekly War' campaign that changes each week. The war includes several levels where you fight one random army in the game and by beating the campaign you unlock coins and upgrade boxes for the turrets.The game has multiplayer listed on the store, but I haven't tried it, and as such I cannot pass judgement on the multiplayer aspect.Overall, if you like 1980s GI Joe or He-Man, and you want to have an afternoon of fun rolling in nostalgia, I'd give it a try. The upside of UPlay is that if you unlock the UPlay achievements, you earn UPlay credits which can unlock cosmetic skins for the default four armies, as well as the soundtrack and backgrounds.If you have any concerns or questions about the game you want to know before buying it, leave a comment and I will answer it and append your answer to my review."

It does not allow you to play as a common tower defense, you are obliged to put specific type of towers in specific places in which not some of them are released. The part you were most anxious to have available might be the hardest to get you to play with your favorite character that needs to fill up an action bar in which gradually it is consuming, alias all the special troops in the game are deteriorated by time and If you leave the exact 15 seconds to build a tower you also lose your troop."

The controls are kind of effed up in a lot of ways but for the most part they are fairly minor. The game is still 100% playable and only causes minor frustration and makes aiming a little harder on some units.Micro transactions are in the game but you do not NEED them by any means. The amount of coins you get from doing content more than pay for the things you want to buy, getting coins from the store is IMO a total waste. I still put this as a con though since it makes handing this to your kid/younger-anything not perfect since you might need to make sure they don't drop $200 on your card buying dumb stuff.Pros:Really fun game, built a lot like the past iterations but with a lot more options and gameplay."

There is four additional armies costing $15.00 which are toys you know and love (He-Man etc) It's kind of upsetting they charge for this but quite frankly this is well worth it, There is way more than $29.99 worth of content here. Also there is online multiplayer versus and co-op my only issue is there isnt enough playing to get a game going but I'm sure that will change in the near future.

Sure, there are a few things that can be worked on, but so far I have only had fun.I have absolutely no problems with the FPS, and I have a stock Lenovo Ideapad Z710, no uprgrades or anything special about it. I had one slow down to like 5 FPS, but the game runs smoothly for me.It's also just a lot of fun. Sure, day one DLC is total BS, but the game is still fun and the in-game currency is not hard to earn. You can get like... 5000 just from doing the first four missions, and you can get anything you want with 2000 coins, so I don't understand anyone's complaints about it being ""unplayable.""I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing this game, and I haven't played the others so I have nothing to compare it to, but I think this is very fun.The only issues I've actually had are the UPlay launcher, which is just annoying, the UI is incredibly small and I at least haven't figured out how to increase the size, but It's kinda guess/check for which buttons to press to control movement of a character/turret, at least for me. The only other problem I've actually had is that flying is absolutely awful, and the mouse seems too sensitive on any setting above .25.What's good about it are pretty much everything else. It's easy to learn, and mostly intuitive. The multiplayer is actually very fun, if you can find someone else playing the game. What else are you even looking for in a tower defense game?In any case, I would definitely reccomend the game. The hate is unnecessary and it's a very fun game."

You generally get all of the upgrades by the end of the campaign by either unlocking them by leveling up however, it is randomised meaning you can get 2 of a kind but this problem is solved with silver which is the stuff you get after EVERY MISSION, atleast a 1000 each time i'd say which is more than enough, along with stored silver, to buy the cheap upgrades. Maybe if your just in it for the multiplayer and not the progression than the microtransactions would be used but they really are a non issue.Now to my list of pros,cons,and mehsProsGood Gameplay with good animationsVery good multiplayerGood SurvivalUpgrading system that allows you to invest more in turrets than beforeUnique hero characters with strengths and weaknesses4 armies(8 with the dlc) that are all unique and all have different strengthsGreat graphicsLots of variety in the main armies(not dlc ones)MehUplay which has gotten better with age but it still isn't easy to swallowMicrotransactions in gameConsLONG LOADING TIMES especially for multiplayerDLC with DAY 1 DLC and future dlc's coming up which I found (including many other people) in the files, stuff like power rangers,war of the worlds,and the armies from the previous games.Framrate drops usually just as a wave is launching which can be annoying for the few seconds they lastLack of Variety in the dlc armies mainly with the heroes.Poor pc controls/UIno options for in-gamechat like volume and stuffLack of care, it is obvious the pc version was just an after thought and that way less care, in the future, will be into this version rather than the consoles which is a shame.In ConclusionI reccommend this game to evryone who is a fan of tower defense games and has a few friends who they can play with, hopefully the game will be better in the future but right now it is money well spent."

I would like to see this patched to go over 60.The other problem is the microtransactions BUT the coins are pretty easy to learn at least from my experience so the microtransactions are pointless.Mutilplayer is a step up from Cold War (played that ALOT on XBLA) with attacking and defending rounds swapping around, making things more interesting.Of course there are problems including reports of crashes and buggy gameplay, stiff performances on high end computers, etc.*UPDATE* Im digging through the files and found some interesting names like Power Rangers, War of the Worlds, Ghost Company and some armies from the past two games. I dont know what they are, they could be related to the Campaign mode but i thoguht it was interesting.*Update 2* Glad to see the Developers of the game are acutally trying to fix most of the known bugs and issues with the game. Give Props to Signal Studios for this! By the Way i Might ReWrite this review.Please comment if you have any questions. Trolling and abusive comments will be deleted."

It's not going away because you wish it would.30FPS will eventually most likely get fixed in the future.I'm fine with a $30 price tag for a game I really enjoy playing and will probably sink WAY over 30 hours into.EDIT: Holy cow, after logging more hours into this puppy I've gotta say, still the Toy Soldiers I loved.Cleared up by a dev you have to buy the other armies which is a little bit of a bummer but still, $15 for a great game and more content if you feel like paying for it. I stand by my $30 isn't much to ask for the play time I'll get out of this.The Microtransaction side of things is not bad either, you earn tokens to upgrade stuff at a nice rate and I've maxed two armies almost by the time I wrote this.TLDR;Stop crying and have fun already.."

,Recommended,276770,17510856,"Posted: 12 August, 2015",all,CoheedxCambria,Never played toy soliders before but this game is great. Very addicting. Graphics don't define a game people. Stop complaining about 30fps lock. The game hasn't crashed once for me and is very playable.

The user interface, menus, and controls are HORRIBLY ported from console. The frame rate is slow and choppy. Everything is either jumpy or completely out of whack.I was a huge fan of toy soldiers and TS cold war, but the gameplay in this one is a step down from those. Go play cold war instead.I refunded this game within an hour of play."

Ideal is solid, but the executon of it is lacking at times, especially in some major points within the game as most of the levels are repeats of levels you already have completed or the odd slow down on a high end machine.But, overall its good time killer and especially a one to be looked at especially if you grew up playing with some of the additional armies, like Cobra, G.I. Joe, and He-Man."

This game has a taste of childhood and it is amazing. It is challenging too. The problem with the DLC has been fixed.  So i can now very recommend this amazing game. Try to pick the hall of fame edition in a sale though ."
76561198042109902,Recommended,276770,20168575,"Posted: 31 December, 2015",all,G4MB1T,"A TD game where you take control of hero units or the towers you build.A game throwback to several playable franchises like he-man and gi.joe.Simple you build towers, upgrade towers take contro lof towers and destroy the enemy.It is quite shortlived as a game and only worth i would say on a sale and as a casual game. Once you figure out which army you like and what and how their towers work can easily take down any wave of enemies. I kept choosing and having a certain play style with Cobra and found that was getting quite easy with my stragety so after playing it few times after beating the game i lost interest, BUT i still had fun with it and if I used it as a casual game rather than pump few hours into it straight away it may have been more long lived."
