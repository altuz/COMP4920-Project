76561197972130272,Recommended,276870,13627600,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,simplex409,"Comparisons between this and War For The Overworld are, of course, inevitable. The fact is, however, that despite the basis of both games on Dungeon Keeper they are very different beasts and I heartily recomend both games to anyone looking for a Dungeon Keepers sequel.WftO is a much more traditional Dungeon Keeper sequel type affair, despite that fact the the (lovely) devs on that team were legally obliged to shout at me whenever I mention that particular EA franchise in relation to their game. They're still great guys, though! :)But Dwelvers is what we're here for so as well as just saying it's a great game I guess I should describe it a little and highlight the differences between this and Dungeon Keeper/WftO.Bottom line? Dwelvers is more in depth and complicated in terms of management of your creatures.A bit more in-depth is to say that it takes the dungeon building of the original and expands upon it in a somewhat Minecraft-feeling type of way. You don't just mine outwards to expand your dungeon, you can also mine up and down and the massive levels very quickly become truly huge, with overland access points and monster rooms scattered here and there, as well as resource points and The Maze.As well as the addition of the third dimension in terms of exploring, there is also a lot more to do to keep your creatures happy, fed, and equipped. Gone is the gold of the original which would fuel an automated chicken farm. Now you have to carefully manage your crops, mills, kitchen, fishers, brewers, and ensure there's enough space for everyone to get to the table laden with food. It makes it feel more engaging than the original and adds a big dimension that makes it feel like a living dungeon rather than a ... I dunno ... Almost like a franchise in the original? You threw gold alone at it and it worked however much you messed up your layout. This is a different beast and you should really be prepared to deal with the layout problems that will inevitably crop up.Defending your dungeon is quite aa lot more in depth than the original as well. Or it can/will be at least. As well as your indirectly controlled creatures you also have your delightful array of traps which is where things get deliciously sadistic. As with Minecraft's redstone circuits, gone are the days of a line of automated cannons and it has been replaced with a potentially massively complicated hydraulics system.Potentially? Yep. You can have a pressure pad which makes a cannon fire or a wall squish someone very easily, but you can also push the boat out and use the already impressive array of hydraulic systems to make gob-smackingly complex trap systems on mulitple levels doing all sorts of terrible things to your enemies. Blowing them up and squishing them are just the start, if you want to put the time and imagination in.So, verdict?This game is in alpha. It shows in the rough menus and UI elements, particularly the missing tooltips on some windows, but it's already lightyears ahead of Dungeon Keeper and a very different beast to War For The Overworld - If you're looking for a traditional DK then I'd point you toward WftO but if you're looking for something that builds on the original in terms of management and building complexity, Dwelvers is definitely for you."

I have not yet had the ability to afford it more time, But, I can say the few minutes of the tutorial I have played so far were quite enjoyable, and I'll definately be coming back for another round, when I have more free time.

You will spend hours glued to the computer playing this game. Digging tunnels has never been so fun, especially when you are battling the occasional cave-in which reveals nice loot or enemies under the earth!Pros:Great dungeon builder and management gamePlenty of rooms to buildCrafting armor/weaponsRaid the surface for supplies and fight humansTrain your troops (awesome)Set up trade routes to other areasTraps FTW - moveable fake walls, cannons, and more!Combat is actually cool to watch. Wounded troops will try to run away before they are killed, covered in blood (haha)Surprises while digging, such as cave-ins leaving goblins stranded in the depths below, or revealing enemy monsters or humans digging themselves.Cell shaded graphics in my opinion look good in thisCons:Normal difficulty seems a little too easy, but hard difficulty is really hard! (Can't imagine what Nightmare is like)Lots of minions as you expand, might be a bit overwhelming for someMight be a little confusing as to what's going on sometimesNo hot key to rally troops, but you can do so from a wheel menu by right clicking (takes a little bit longer)"

Certainly shows the most promise out of all the games inspired by DK that I've tried over the years. The 3D dungeons are awesome, although some way of building over pits would be welcome.Resources come in more types than in DK2 (Which only had gold, iirc). Here you must actually manage production lines as well as mine the appropriate resources. You can also make resource trades with the surface world, which makes things a bit easier if you end with an overabundance of some resources -although the available trades are limited. Traps require a lot more planning than in DK - pressure plates and wires rather than self-activated when something appears in range.Can't wait to see how it develops, with more rooms, more creatures (Friendly and not) and several other things (there's a list on their forums)"

This thing is innovative and extremely interesting, and different, with its depth aspect and collapses.It's one of those games you can sit down and with just a little focus you wind up getting sucked straight into it - gathering, expanding, exploring, trying to survive multiple types of fatal threats.Before you know it (assuming you're able to survive and grow) hours have disappeared.It's so close to being at-least a minimum set of game aspects to be ""considered"" a functioning game. No idea if this will ever be finished, but it's a real loss far as I'm concerned if it doesn't.I played the absolute hell of out the thing in its current form - that's the only reason I haven't been back in it for a long time. Burnt out, but with it being so long now maybe I'll take another spin through it some time soon - and I'll enjoy it for what it is at the moment.I still recommend it but only at an rock bottom price due to it not being complete.Updated: 7/30-2016The pace has slowed to a crawl. Read topics or dig to see the various reasons.Still have hope this outstanding attempt gets finished and polished in some real way.-----------------------------------------------Original:The developers are amazingly active and immediately responsive to the community, fixing problems and implementing requests.Dwelvers offers dungeon layers, cave ins, topside action, craftable equipment and all kinds of ♥♥♥♥.It's excellent, getting even better as things progress and on the road to being my definitive choice astheDK successor.I don't know how far and to what depth the topside will become.

Poor feedback - It's hard to know why your economy is about to get stuck (food, money, etc.)3. 3D world is confusing - You can dig down to lower levels but figuring out how to get out of a hole or build a ladder or whatever is very confusingOverall it seems like the developers had a promising start but got stuck.

However, this one doesn't really play like Dungeon Keeper or War for the Overworld -- it's more like a simplified Dwarf Fortress, which is totally fine.  This game also uses different resources, e.g. wood and iron, which is an addition to the usual Dungeon Keep formula, again, more like a simplified Dwarf Fortress.Digging is unusually satisfying in this game, I think because it's in more than two dimensions.It could use more unit types and enemy types, but I think the developer is workin on it --  still early acces.I like it."

Since the dungeon keeper sort of genera is incredibly difficult to nail correctly, i had absolutely no hope for this game.  So I picked up the free demo on their website ((which steam does not have yet,)) and gave it a shot to see how badly it failed.  45 minutes later, i was purchasing the full game.  Or rather, the pre-alpha.  Even as a pre-alpha game that is no where near complete, it is a LOT of fun with only one minor visual bug that i've found so far.  I just spent roughly...7 hours i believe playing the sandbox in a single play.   The game is a little difficult at the beginning.  There is a minotaur maze in the game that I had wandered into on accident intended as your end game challenge.  I was slaughtered, barely managing to block off the minotaurs before retreating.  But the next 5 hours of my game play was a satisfying mix of raiding smaller groups of weaker enemies and looking for new armor and weapons I could give to my fighters, and developing infrastructure to support my rapidly growing horde.  every complaint I have about this game is due purely to the fact that it is in alpha.  Resources are a bit imbalanced with wood being painfully difficult to get ((but a good incentive to leave your base and explore the underworld)) and stone far far too plentiful with massive piles of it stacking up in my store rooms.  ((this gave me incentive to construct more rooms and find more resources))  There was a single broken texture having to do with placing a skull candle in a prison cell breaking the texture of the wall below it.  However, this will not stop me from playing much much more of this game!  About 7 hours into the game and only on easy, so I cant wait to amp up the difficulty!TL;DR This game is freakin sweet and an incredible reboot of the dungeon master genera of game.  I highly recommend playing it and beg you to forgive the slightly off balancing issue, as it is still in alpha and will be fixed soon, I am sure.  Play the demo to see if you like the genera and if you do, BUY IT!"

This is probably worth the money in its current state, but future updates could turn this into one of the best values on steam.In conclusion, its unfinished and in early access but this game might become the next game everybody plays, records on you tube, and raves about if the Dev keeps it up (and adds multi-player} I highly recommend."

The graphics look compressed, cheap, tacky (missing some shaders tharr?), the options are very limited; AA? AF? Low/Med/High at least? Not really, there's no 'high' details, there's obviously a launcher option for it, but whether you can call it 'high' is another story. No windowed resizable, borderless, either play a pre-defined size or be forced on to the ever so unstable (for any game) 'Fullscreen'... but at least you get to set your FPS to 120 or something right?  .... nupe. Very lacking.The menu's still ugly, UI just got an update, it's still tacky and ugly and thats before you get to the gameplay, which is much like the old Dungeon Keeper classics, only... less polished and with more micro-management.Few bugs.. random crashes.. random stoppages mid-event screwing your game over, random pawn fails.Don't get me wrong, there is gameplay, but you'll pick it up, play it a few hours, put it down and barely ever touch it again.This is a game that is suppose to be 'released' May this year and is still in 'alpha', still Kickstarter'ing and still in 'Early Access' (which for this long, should be made illegal) - for what the game currently is, it's not worth £14.99, half maybe.The whole ""one man team, oh woe is he/she"" doesn't really fly anymore, better games have been made for far less.Wait until it's 'released', this ""Early Access"" rubbish really just isn't worth the waiting, if they ever 'release'."

The lead developer just released a statement saying he couldn't raise enough money and is now on to other things.This game has never been anything more than a glorified dungeon construction manager.  There is no substance to it.  No wild and exciting adventures to be had alone or with your pals.♥♥♥♥ this game all to hell and ♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who got on my case about the release date -- you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s know that whole thing is a ♥♥♥♥ing sham.I don't care if a game isn't even in beta yet, if you're selling it you owe it to your customers to deliver.MOTHA ♥♥♥♥ DWELVERS AND MOTHA ♥♥♥♥ MELLO TONIN FOR DEFENDING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY TO BEGIN WITH."

It is absolutely impossible to control how things are built, constantly having production facilities sitting idle (tried linking, no idea what that does, didn't work), tried unbuilding, rebuilding, still didn't work. I end up just creating a giant hole accidentally digging deeper instead of actually building what I'm trying to F'n build! Tried building extra paths to some of the faciltiies that might be blocked, tried taking manual control over creatures, nothing is working! Tried a couple games now, same result, everyone starves inside of 20 minutes. Tried the tutorial, built everything that was indicated and progressed through it, still the supply chain sat idle and everyone starved. After two frustrating hours, this game is a total waste!"

It is a 3D dungeon simulator.The game is overly complex and very buggy.  Anytime I hear that a game has a ""steep learning curve"" I cringe, that basically means bad tutorials ... and this one has a VERY steep learning curve and VERY bad tutorials.  You will need to watch countless videos just to learn how to feed your troops and keep them from killing you.The challenge is not in the dungeon enemies or the environment, its in the poor interface and concept design."

But the only downsides are that its sorta limited, like once you have the whole underground conquered and  no more enemies underground, the minions sometimes tend to stop and just idle instead, which really jacks up the game. A good game, people should try it, good job to the developers for making such a great game."

Dont waste your money.[Old review]If you're ok with testing, you can put up with the bugs and you like the Dungeon Keeper genre then this is a great example.Its not a straight out DK clone either. It can stand on its own with a host of different features like production chains and resource management as well as three dimentional dungeon creation. This means you need to provide your minions with food and drink and weapons and armor. You can also be more creative and build things like a lava moat around your base. Oh and theres a lot of hydrualic options aswell, although i havnt played around with these yet so i cant comment on how they work.A mention also must be made for the developer Rasmus who despite being extremely busy working on the game still takes time out on the games own website and steam forums to answer posts and help out players.Overall a very enjoyable game even in early access as long as you accept the inevitable bugs."
