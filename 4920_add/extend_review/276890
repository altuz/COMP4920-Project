I remember playing the original FATE as a child, so I thought I'd rev up the nostalgia train by getting the sequel to the game.  The game is simple and addicting.  The game has a classic RPG feel to it that reminds me of D&D, but with a single-player twist.  A must for any gamer who enjoys a straightforward, dungeon delving, RPG."

You never know what the merchants will have next. Transforming your pet, fishing 24/7, quests, skill depth, and the anticipation of finding that one item that you can sell for huge amounts of gold is what keeps me going. Would love to see more and more games in this series!"

All in all, a great deal.After several hours of gameplay I realized I wouldn't be anywhere without Axehammer's Mighty Elven Amulet of Vitality, or Beastdal's Superior Piercing Gemmed Belt of Wealth, and don't even get me started on Khelamroth's Flaming Icy Solid Elite Bone Sabre of Quickness. Man this is an awesome game, am I right?"
,Recommended,276890,10058513,"Posted: 8 May, 2014",all,Time_Lord_Ninja,"This game is imaginitive and reaches into your hearts and brings out the true adventurer. Although you are always the size of a munchkin, you get to delve deep into the mysteries that are the catacombs, caves, and dungeons that lay within ruin below civilization. You and your awesome transformable pet try to regain your power and fame, you against the world for the cause of a hero is with you. But seriously, I love the game, even though it's a slow start at a low level(you can cheat), once you get past a certain level you are met with real challenges(unless you cheated), and the game actually takes concentration and strategy. And once you finish the game, you can choose one object and it becomes a relic for your ancestor, who you playthrough 2 as! Replay value is immense, none of the quests are ever the same, nor the items, and you make a cool lineage of hero's! Kinda sounds like Fable to me, but none-the-less I give this game a rating of 8/10. Losing points for originality and lack of major plot."

I enjoy the last two games the most, but building from here to get there makes it just that more enjoyable when you do move on to take on the Traitor Soul.I recommend all FATE games."

They follow you around, you can not attack them. They will swarm your enemies.2. Manual is very incomplete. If you have played FATE then you know about your stash and the Enchanter. They manual does NOT tell you where to find these items and they are ""hidden"" inside two of the realms. If you didn't know about them you can spend a LOT of time selling stuff you should keep and dying a lot since your stuff is not upgraded.Wild Tangent does not answer directly any of these problems or bugs.Wild Tangent DID post a FIX for the graphics issue that crashed the game so don't bother telling eveyone it doesn't work.STEAM defers everyting to Wild Tangent and won't answer how to get into the online backup of your saved games.This means even uninstalling and reinstalling will not get rid of the extra pets."

,Not Recommended,276890,13918917,"Posted: 9 January, 2015",all,Count Drake-ula Dangereulești,"tl;dr:Play Torchlight 1/2 over this if you can.Actual Review:Fate is a Hack & Slash in the same vein as Diablo 2,Titan Quest and Torchlight(this franchise began waaay before Torchlight and actually inspired a lot of mechanics for Torchlight.)It's fairly simple to pick up,you make a character,pick gender,choose from a limited set of appearances and load up in the game.It's exactly like the first Fate,all the systems and mechanics of the previous game are present in this installment,and while it adds some new things,like more unique items and items in general,more pet transformations and two outposts to chose from over the generic setting of Grove in the first game..i can't recommend this game,and i think that a big part of that is because i played Torchlight 2 before i played Fate.Fate introduced a lot of cool systems that weren't done(as far as i know,don't take this for granted) such as the pet system and the ability to tell your pet to go to town and sell all your items you don't need(so handy!!),more freedom when it comes to class specialization,fishing for pet transformations and such things like that.And thats kinda where my positives about the game end,since i played TL2 before Fate,it felt to me like i played a inferior version of Torchlight,everything that Fate does now is done muuuuch better in Torchlight 2,i personally found the music of Fate pretty good but became very old very quickly since the game has a very limited soundtrack,i disliked the art-style and the generic and basic feel of the combat. The story is a pretty boring one aswell,the narrator is abit wooden if you ask me,i quickly just ignored the story and focused on the game's mechanics instead.When it comes to a very important part of an Hack & Slash,Fate just fails to entertain me with good and unique items,it's your typical 4% extra damage and +15 fire damage,nothing interesting,the game also has no active skills aside from magic,no melee or ranged skills that you can activate,no talents or very indepth specialization like you have in Diablo 2,all you do is increase Strength and put 2 points in Spear skill when you level up and that was fine in 2005 but in 2015 it's been done so much that quite frankly,i'm sick of it.The combat is also pretty straightfoward,just hit the enemy with your sword,walk back as the enemy begins attacking then hit the enemy again,and because of the fact that the combat isn't very satisfying,it's tedious.And this becomes even more apparent in the abhorrent Hardcore mode which increases enemy damage and health to an unfair level while giving you nothing,and it locks to permadeath(which i'd be fine with if it weren't for the artifical and BS difficulty)But,i have to stress that my experience is somewhat spoiled because of the fact i played Torchlight 2 before i played Fate,so if you never played TL2 or any Hack and Slash,Fate is actually a very good and basic choice to get into the genre,it's straightfoward and decent at what it does,it does have a helpful amount of tips in the loading menus,there are no complex systems like the charge system in Torchlight and there isn't a very big amount of strategy required to be good at the game.So while i appreciate and respect what Fate meant for the Hack and Slash genre,and while it brings a loooot of good and sensible mechanics into the genre like pets and such,Torchlight 2 just does it so much better that i can't recommend it in this day and age.And that's a shame because Fate is a pretty significant game when you see what it inspired and i had a decent time with,it just doesn't hold up against TL2 in any way shape or form."

I would contact Wild Tangent and they would fix it, but it would sometimes happen again. I was happy to see Fate games on Steam and purchased a couple of them. We were happy once again until I downloaded Windows 10. I was never told these Fate games wouldn't work with Windows 10, and they haven't fixed this issue yet. Thanks, Wild Tangent (or Windows).

,Recommended,276890,16215361,"Posted: 5 June, 2015",all,BoyishFever,"The FATE series in general is still fairly good even compared to today's dungeon crawlers.One little thing they could improve upon is the hardcore gameplay. Besides providing a challenge throught the entire course of the game, every floor has enemies that jump up every 10 levels which just adds to the difficulty in a substantial way. The issue with this is you really have to grind out the @ss just to stay up to par with the enemies. Imagine fighting off a level 50 boss + minions all while still level 10-20ish. The disadvantage here is the hit rating against you for being severly underleveled. This applies to singled out mobs too as they are still a threat even with good gear.But overall if you don't play for the hardcore but the various other features the game has to offer, by all means get FATE and all its sequels when they go one sale."
