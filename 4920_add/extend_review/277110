(More on that in a second).This game is an absolute masterpiece for point and clicks in my opinion. A Solid 9.5/10.But there is a major flaw. For a lot of people, this game won't run. I have figured out a workaround for this:Few things you have to do here depending on your OS; but all are collectively here.1. Right click the game in your Steam Library and select ""Properties"". Select the ""Local Files"" tab and click ""Verify Integrity of Game Cache"". You will notice that 1 of the files is corrupt and will be re-downloaded. This doesn't always happen instantly and you may or may not see it in the download section. If you don't see it, don't worry - It'll happen. Move on, regardless.2. Navigate to the Steamapps\Common\Return to Mysterious Island Folder. Once there, Right click Game.exe and select properties. Click the compatibility tab and select ""Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows XP (Service Pack 3). Select ""Run this program as an administrator"". Then click ""Apply"" and then ""OK""3. Repeat this process for the file: RtMI.exe. Selecting BOTH the Compatibility mode as well as the Administrator rights.4. Setting Windowed Mode - (Optional, in some cases.): Open the file: config.ini with Notepad. Inside, you will find a line that says: ""bFullScreen=1"" Change this to say 0 (zero) instead of 1. Save the file.At this point, you're finished, but you CAN NOT run the game through the Steam Library. Instead, launch the file: Game.exe FROM THE FOLDER (Shortcuts won't work) and the game should start. Most won't require Windowed Mode - so try skipping Step 4 first. if it doesn't work, you can change to windowed mode in the .ini and adjust resolution as needed by adjusting the ""bScreenResolution"" string.Hope this helps anyone enjoy a wonderful Point and Click adventure! Don't forget to pick up Part 2, it's even better!--Reli"

It even has some replay value, because you get points for all you do and all puzzles you solve - and you can always try to get a better score and look which solution you might have missed last time.If you can get over the ""old"" display settings and are into adventure games, you should give this a try.

,Recommended,277110,32043758,Posted: 29 May,all,Lightbringer,"It's an adventure game from 2004, best compared to ""Myst"" and alike, that has aged surprisingly well. I'm writing this in 2017.You spent most of your time clicking yourself though locations at which you can rotate the view around 360°, above and below, and finding hotspots for things to pick up or combine to solve puzzles. The interface is from a previous era of interface design, and meant to work well for lower screen resolutions, but manageable. Once you reached a certain point in the game, it will offer you hints for things in your inventory, which make some puzzles way to easy (you can't turn of the in-game encyclopaedia). On the other hand, the game offers to comment or hints on most of the hotspots you find in the game world, so you either know what to do there or resort to Trial & Error pretty quickly.Many puzzles can be solved with different items - what I found highly irritating because your inventory quickly becomes cluttered with items that are meant for puzzles you have already solved. However, complexer solutions give you a higher score - meant to increase the replayability of the game.Which I found zero - don't get me wrong! This is a cute little game with a compelling enough story to entertain me for a few hours, but the narrative wasn't complex enough to keep me playing after I saw the epilogue after nearly 7 hours. Charming nevertheless, though I expected a few more actual puzzles (math games, levers, etc.)."

From cluncky menu movement to one of the worst option menu's I have seen in a while...This game could have been a ton better if it wasn't only for the bad menu design.
76561198045208825,Recommended,277110,9622478,"Posted: 24 March, 2014",all,Shatiz,"Nice little adventure point and click game with a large number of items and multiple solutions to solve the puzzles. You play as Mina, a young woman stranded on a mysterious island when a storm ends her attempts to sail around the world on her own. The premise is nice and the multiple solutions to the puzzles works very well with the survival theme. I'm not sure it really provides replayability though.Trying to tie her fate together with the Jules Verne story also makes for a very bland and forgettable storeline however. It would have been much more interesting to create a more unique story of a woman trying to survive on an island by herself. Moreover, while the interface works well for the most part, there is a certain lack of feedback when using items (either just an error sound or Mina says ""I think something is missing"") that can cause confusion and encourages the tried and tested method of simply trying to combine everything in the hopes it works. One example of this is in the early game where you get a knife blade. Combining this with wood will give it a handle and enable you to cut things at a distance... but what the game doesn't tell you is that the knife then for some reason loses the ability to cut things up close. So when you try this on close items you simply get the error sound, but no indication why it does not work.Overall it is a good puzzler with some interesting mechanics that makes it a bit different from a lot of other point and clicks out there. Had they just spent a bit more time on the story it could have been really great, but as is, I would still recommend it."

,Recommended,277110,12285829,"Posted: 28 September, 2014",all,josseriot,"I really enjoyed this game, although the Steam overlay didn't always detect when I was in-game playing it, so my Steam time does not reflect the total time I've spent playing it.While this is an older game and may not run well on newer systems (see the discussion forum), it ran very well for me on an older laptop with Vista without a single issue. The graphics I think hold up well enough to current standards, although other elements of the game's design, like the inventory interface and the menu, do feel a bit dated. But that wasn't a big obstacle for me.Since I'm a Jules Verne fan, I really enjoyed the Verne-inspired elements of the story a lot. The story felt to me to start slowly, mostly because the first part of the story you are collecting many items that you won't need until later, but the more I progressed in the game the more I enoyed the story. The game's real strength is in the well-designed puzzles and crafting that you do throughout the game. While the style in which the game introduces collectable items and hints on how to craft things and solve puzzles may take some getting used to, I utlimately found puzzle-solving in this game to be very rewarding and satisfying. By and large, the game assumes the player has some smarts, something that games these days don't always do. There are a few puzzles that allow you some variance in how to solve them, including the final puzzle that completes the game, and I think that is very player-friendly as the game doesn't expect every player to think the same way. And of course, there are many walkthroughs available should you get stuck. I would advise saving often, in case you miss something and want to re-do a section or simply want to try doing it a different way."

Well I have 7.4 hours on record for this game which turned out to be 7 hours too many.  This game caused 7.4 hours of argurments and anger in my household.  As a female game player I typically enjoy these types of games but after probably the first half hour found out that there was no logic whatsoever to this game.   You have to be some mad scientist MacGyver and craft items that make no sense at all.  This game was sooo irritating and I continued to play to see if ultimately it would make any sense or at least have a good ending.  But alas neither logic or a good ending came and at the end i was just left with far too many hours invested and a hugely disappointed ending.  So if you enjoy the type of game that you could be totally mindless and rely on the help of a trained monkey then by all means enjoy this game.

I had no issues running this on my Windows 7 64 bit, but it does only run in 1024 x 768 and I found no way to change that.  Grab it and enjoy the adventure :-)"

Solving puzzles is really rewarding and they felt mostly organic and logical in the context of the game. The island setting was really nice. The story was ok. The best part is that you have a pet monkey and he's used for solving various puzzles. There was one part that was tough where you've gotta evade some killer robots and figuring out where to go just seemed like blind trial and error more than thinking through the situation. That was only a really small part of the game, though. I definitely recommend Return to Mysterious Island to genre fans.Note: I got this on Steam after already beating it elsewhere, hence the short play time."

It was a lot better than I expected.Mixing the point-and click genre with polished game-y ideas of surviving, this game feels really good to play!Gameplay varies somewhat throughout the game and you feel invested towards the very end! The score system adds some replayability, which is really clever since the genre dictates to be none there.The story is lighthearted and keeps you interested.I would recommend this to everyone! Amazing hidden gem."

,Recommended,277110,31136237,Posted: 14 April,all,CleverKitty,"Its a really good game and aged pretty decently. I often found myself confused about what to do or how to put objects together. But in general, I enjoyed myself. It has a great ending that really made me feel satisfied with the ending so that is definitely something to consider! I'd recommend getting it on sale if you want to get it though because to me its not worth the $8 that you would spend normally. It's age and content just don't justify the price for me. I got it in a bundle when I bought syberia! So that is how I got this game."
