Though it would be best if youbought ""Return to Mysterious Island"" before you bought ""Return to Mysterious Island 2"".But in the end you deside. I Would definitely rate this game.7-10.Because i had some.. Some trouble understanding what i was going to do. xD"

If you haven't played it, you have to - this 2 game set is an amazing experience. The puzzles range from easy to very difficult. This game adds a few new mechanics to the series. I won't spoil them for you, but know that if you played the first game (and even some of the other games in this company's library, like Journey to the Moon) Then you'll enjoy the ending parts of this one.One small issue I've noticed that some people experience is the game launches with a BLACK SCREEN. The easy fix for this is to set your monitor's resolution to 1024x768 as that is the game's native resolution. This game, unlike Part 1 will actually launch from Steam's Library.All in all - I HIGHLY recommend playing both of these titles. If you want to play the whole series - Play Journey to the Moon, Return to Mysterious Island 1 and then 2.Enjoy!"

I really liked the first game in the series, but this one is much more difficult and closer to a MYST-type game. Too many obscure clues/puzzles and too many situations where you have no idea what to do next ^^; I took a break about 3/4 through, though the story picks up a little later. There are two endings...make sure to see both!"

There is continuity involved between both the story and the objects from the first game. The second game's storyline does take a turn for the weird, but it was still fun. At first, it feels like you are stuck in the same small area of exploration on the island that was available in game 1, but it opens up as the story progresses. A few of the puzzles will feel familiar from game one, others are trial and error and few more require some thought. At the end, you are given a choice. You can play through both options if you want."

I loved the story and the majority of things about that game. I would totally recommend it for sensitive people who love exploring, puzzles and the wild. The only thing that seemed quite unrealistic was the modern technologies appearance from 1860, but that's debatable and it doesn't take a great part in the game. I would rate it 9/10."

Refreshing, great puzzles (although you might need a walkthrough for all the combinations), great cutscenes and graphics and a great ending, maybe a fitting ending to the game and not to leave room for a sequel.The second one, this one, is like the first - except someone decided to take the first and sh** all over it. First of all, the voice acting. This woman is ideal as Kate Walker from the Syberia series, but in this one, it's like a hotline for doctors; ""now I need my bandage"" she says, in an all seductive voice. There is also the WORST kind of puzzle: eating. As a castaway, you CANNOT be expecting a full course. So, when you offer the characters a raw egg TWICE, they will say ""No, not this, I need something else for a change."" You ARE ON A F****** ISLAND, YOU STUPID B****. Let me send a buffet, hold on. And those ""energy bars"". Fill them up, but don't give them TWO raw eggs no no no...Also, I wish there was an option where you WOULD NOT have to see the characters blink and watch you move, eat, talk to your cellphone and other activities... Creepy.Furthermore, the ending SUCKS. There are two ways to end the game and the one sucks so much I'm not even going to write it.On the positive side, there are many new locations and a lot to explore.So, if you are looking for a game to smash your nerves to pieces and make you hate adventure gaming, it's here.Thank you Microids. You officialy SUCK."

Yes, this is a sequel and you really need to start with the first one, as this continues where it left off.  It is also a bit harder than the first one, and you may need to resort to a guide occasionally.  The story is good, better than the first one, and it is longer as well.  Overall, the two games create one satisfying point and click experience that is well worth your time."
,Recommended,277270,28724304,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,goatacus,the thing is with the first game is that it totally seems like a casual ordinary experience. it isn't until the last third of the game things start to get creepy. well this game expands upon that last third x100.♥♥♥♥♥♥s cray. overall a much more interesting game but people tend to say it's not as good as the first. it's kind of hard to judge when the game mechanics are so simple.7/10
76561198063193728,Recommended,277270,14857350,"Posted: 12 March, 2015",all,Sayanne,"Second part of Return to Mystery IslandWhen finally rescue arrives, your luck turns again, and you end up again on the Island.This time you need to find a way to stop the total destruction of the Island, with the help of Jep (your Monkey). In this part you can switch from Minna and Jep depending on the task at hand.Again, like the first part I had to use a walkthrough more then once to find out what to do next, or to find items needed to progress.I love puzzle games, but this survival game is hard to complete, and not intuitive at all. Plus some puzzle are nearly impossible to complete and some are just a game of chance.Despite all this, I still recommend it, if you want to rack your brains and are not scared of using walkthroughs and if it is on rebate."
,Recommended,277270,31139416,Posted: 14 April,all,CleverKitty,This one was very difficult but enjoyable too. I don't have much to say about it really though because if I had to choose one or the other of them I'd choose the first in this series. The first just seemed to be more enjoyable and make more sense when it came to the puzzles.
,Recommended,277270,29437932,Posted: 22 January,all,Doctor Naterson,"This game had such great potential. Many of the puzzles at the beginning of the game were quite good. I also personally liked how you switch between Mina and Jep. The story started out interesting enough, but then flatlined at the end. I recommend this game overall out of love of the series. Not as good as the first game, but it is worth a try."
,Recommended,277270,20731520,"Posted: 24 January, 2016",all,[DoN] nVader,"If you like the first one, you'll probably love this one.The puzzles are rather open ended, there is an interesting story, and the atmosphere is splendid.In my opinion the difficulty of the puzzles is perfect. Challenging, but not impossible. And you'll come up with some pretty creative solutions when you play.Compared to the first game, this one seems much bigger. I would say 2-3 times as big. It took me 10 hours to complete, and I was neither fast nor slow I think. There are many new mechanics, so it is definitely not just the first game all over. It continues where the first game left and adds a bunch of new stuff that make a lot of sense.Definitely recommend to any fan of this genre."
