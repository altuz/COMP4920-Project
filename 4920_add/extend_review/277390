If you're not convinced, watch the trailer!"

Winning does feel REAL good. The soundtrack is slick. The minimalist design is excellent (Jony Ives meets Johnny Madden).Now for some of my personal experience. You'll be screaming lots when you play. The game elements have a combinatorial thing going on, where even though there's only, like 7 types of objects in the game, and there will only be a dozen in your vicinity, that's still 7 to the 12th power number of situations you can be in, and it's never obvious what the best thing to do is. You have to strategize while having good gamer skillz to turn your strategies into action. You can be a hotshot and do sick plays with your chevron. You'll have that temptation to show off, whether it's a good idea or not.All in all, it's brilliant. Multiplayer games just keep getting better and better. This is one of the best ever made.Local MP is the main focus. The aforementioned screaming is better in person. It's one joystick and one button, so Grandma can hop in and figure it out in a few minutes, although an experienced Videoball player will still kick her wrinkly butt.There is online play, and it's a little sloppy -- it's hard to find a match sometimes, sometimes inviting friends doesn't work, sometimes there's goofy lag. Uh, whatever! It's good enough, and for a ten dollar game, it's gravy.There is however, one major threat to the well-being of this electronic sport. It's called VIDEOBLOOD Doping. Unscrupulous VIDEOBALLERS attempting to gain an edge in VIDEOBALL will inject themselves with blood that contains caffeine, taurine, and B12. This is a horrible practice and sets a poor example for young athletes. Please help me to raise awareness of this issue."

It's the most polished $10 game I've  ever bought. The soundtrack is spot on as well.It has a very addictive arcade feel to it. I wasn't very excited for the game based on the trailer alone, but I became hooked  right after my first match. Everyone should give this a try. It's simple enough that even my mother watched me play it and immediately understood what was going on."

It would be 100% awesome if you just played entirely with likeminded friends in the same room as you. The design is pretty phenomenal.I wish you could change the main menu music and I wish you could set announcers to randomly switch or alternate between games.Possible downsides:- Online is cool but has a fair amount of host advantage, host always plays the game smoothly but the clients connected can often get some pretty bad lag with no way to check ping for any players, or cancel a match, or chat.- No dedicated 'quit'/'back' button that I can find, because every button is confirm."

,Recommended,277390,24341213,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,meauxdal,"A game of astounding depth, nuance, and intensity. A masterpiece of minimalist mechanics manifesting myriad makeshift methodologies. As pure an electronic sports game that has ever existed; this game is not merely an inferior simulation of a convoluted traditional sport (e.g. FIFA, Madden), but a novel sport designed specifically to take advantage of the videogame format and remove every remnant of that which is not absolutely vital to the game's thrust. You will find yourself agonizing over fractions-of-degrees on your attempted cross-court Downtown in a 9-9 game. You'll feel the exultant triumph of a game-winning Grand Slam. A sneaky Slam Dunk. A cocky Jam. Everything in this game *feels good*. It's a game that's as forward-thinking as it is reverent to gaming history. The design philosophy represents an ideal that has increasingly vanished from the aims of major development studios. Simply: a breath of fresh air.Highly recommended."
,Recommended,277390,24297839,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,Note,"Videoball... Sorry, I need to clear my throat for this one...VIDEOBALL is an air hockey-Asteroids-Crossfire(the board game) mashup sports game where you shoot projectiles at the ball(s) and can use them to stun other players (including your teammates). Games can be 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 if you're feeling up for one VIDEOBALL match you'll never forget. The controls remind me of Asteroids except more floaty, but they're fine. I also appreciate the intuitiveness for just using the control stick and any one button to navigate though menus, though it can get somewhat confusing at times. It's not a horrible thing though. If you're a shut-in like me, you'll be glad that there's AIs, each with their own behaviors. You could have an AI for scoring, an AI for defending, and you, for.. Whatever you want to do, I guess. Even with the large amount of customization available in exhibition matches, there's also an arcade mode where you (and a friend (assuming you have any after kicking their♥♥♥♥♥in VIDEOBALL)) can play against predetermined AIs in several different arenas. There's also an online mode which I h̶a̶v̶e̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶t̶r̶i̶e̶d̶ ̶y̶e̶t̶ ̶(̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶u̶p̶d̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶r̶e̶v̶i̶e̶w̶ ̶w̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶I̶ ̶a̶c̶t̶u̶a̶l̶l̶y̶ ̶f̶i̶n̶d̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶o̶n̶e̶)̶.̶ tried and it's actually better than I expected with all the stuff that can be onscreen. Sure, there were a few hiccups here and there, but I played a 3v3 with little to no lag and that's awesome.So yeah, that's pretty much Video- VIDEOBALL.

76561198009981585,Recommended,277390,24325855,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,Saddleblasters,"Videoball is a sport defined by the millisecond differences between success and failure.You charge shots. You position yourself at optimal scoring position. If any enemy shot hits you you are knocked off of your trajectory and your charge disappears.Shot power isn't linear -- shots come in discrete shot types. It takes time to charge to a particular shot type. Videoball is all about the bargain between the right time to shoot and the right shot type to shoot with.Charging to certain shot types -- the level 3 shot, for example -- is terrifying. Seeing an enemy's level 3 shot hit the ball is even more terrifying. Videoball is a test of how well you can deal with pure terror.Winning at Videoball always feels like an impossible event, something that can never happen -- even after you've already won a hundred times. No matter who you play against in Videoball, Videoball is a fight against giants. Literally, the closest game to Videoball is Shadow of the Colossus. Videoball is what Shadow of the Colossus wassupposedto feel like."

I disapprove but I'll try my best.Also, what's wrong with people leaving an online match after the first one? What it is christmas outside? Get real, play again.This is a real videogame, you can feel your brain building new connections while playing, the controls are amazing, there's depth to discover in every moment and angle. The music was composed by someone that surelly does this for a job, it's serious. The voice that does the commentary remind me of Real Human Basketball (another good one).I still hadn't the opportunity to play it locally, clearly it's the perfect game for screaming with friends. The online works despite a few launch problems.Only thing that I'm hating are the menu, the one button idea from divekick is not so cool, also the back button is often incoherently placed. There's no audio notification when the online player connects to your match and when an error happens online you can't see it since you are pressing the button and dismissing it immediatelly. When you have to select multiple CPUs locally it's a pain (UPDATE: it's a feature! they're different characters).But those are minor stuff, Tim Rogers basically doesn't care, the game is about people that can jump in the same room. The online will help ok if needed.BUY-IT.P.S. The police stealed this man car. That's the best reason you've got."

,Recommended,277390,24619925,"Posted: 30 July, 2016",all,Acceptable Ghost,"I always thought this game was cool ever since I played it years back at PAX East but I was always worried that it would only really work with 2 on 2 (and in my situation it is much easier to get a 1 on 1 local game going). After playing it for several hours I can say that 1 on 1 holds up well and is very fun to play. That combined with decent bots allowing for an OK 2 on 2 experience (1 player and a bot on each side) makes the game worth it for me. Due to the niche nature of the game if you want to do online play you will probably have to set it up with friends. The local experience is great if you are in a situation where that is possible.My major complaint is probably the inflexibility of the online play. You cannot do multiple local players + online. You cannot add bots online. There is no server browser or any sort of indication of how many people are online. Do not buy this game expecting to play with randoms online. Also there are some small PC issues such as lack of an exit button and not being able to skip the Unity launcher, but supposedly these are being worked on and hopefully will be patched soon.Note: I probably have a low amount of hours played on this account. This is due to me mostly playing this game locally on a seperate family shared account."

As you get more familiar with the game, you begin to fully understand and appreciate all the four different charge levels for shots.This game makes you feel good: scoring a touchdown, aiming a level two triangle perfectly so it can push the ball across the court, being advantageously blasted by an opponent into a better position, reversing a level three shot, etc. You're bound to encounter countless feel-good moments in every single game.This game's at its best as a local multiplayer game, where you can sit down with some buds and play the game latency-free. However, there is an online mode. Although you're unlikely to find an open random lobby, you definitely can play online if you coordinate with the friendly folks in the official Discord server, where people are setting up ranked matches throughout the day. Or you could play with your friends online of course. It's unfortunate you can't just pop in a game, but it's not too inconvenient to coordinate.There can be some latency online for everyone who isn't the host, but it's not unbearable for me usually and I still have fun.If you're into competitive games and you have friends to play with or are willing to join the Discord server, you should consider buying this game.Also you should play with a controller."
