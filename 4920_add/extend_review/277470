,Not Recommended,277470,9621797,"Posted: 24 March, 2014",all,Serp,"This isn't the worst RPG Maker game I've played, but It's not the best either. I hate to dump on indie game developers, but I really can't recommend this game.Granted, I only played a few hours, so maybe it gets better, but in the time I played the fighting was pretty uninspired. I mostly found myself just fight-buttoning though the same troops of enemies again and again, and I didn't really have to deploy much strategy apart from ""One of my moves can only be used with 4 or more enemies, so use that if there are 4 or more enemies.""I really don't care for the writing either. The dialogue between characters seems like a nonstop train of snarkiness that is trying to be playful and funny but I can't say I laughed at any of it. I am 27 and sort of jaded. I may have found it funnier when I was a teenager I suppose. I spent most of the game with two party members, and then when another was potentially going to join me, I had to choose between her and the one I already had. These characters were very cliched ""young cute love interest"" and ""mature sexy woman love interest"" tropes straight out of any cheesy harem anime.When I first saw signs of the inevitable relationship building between the two charactres  I had in my party, it felt extremely forced and stereotypical. All of a sudden the hardened ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ warrior reveals a deeper side through referencing his tough childhood. Of course.The art is good, and the plot was at least interesting enough to keep me paying attention to it for the short time I played. The dialogue, characters, and combat are what ultimately made me give up on this game after just a few hours. Best of luck to the developer on future games, and I hope my rather harsh review has at least a little bit of helpful criticism."

Although as other have said, it seems every other line from the main character is sarcastic.The main breaking point for me is the leveling. I was somehow able to beat the first boss, mainly due to the fact the main character has a skill which makes the first chapter a cake walk. But the next area, I got one shotted time and time again.My main character is able to withstand any foe, but every supporting character I have just gets 1-2 shotted. I even tried grinding a bit, but after several hours? (it felt like that), I feel my characters still aren't there. The weapons and armor didn't seem to help much, and many items seem very expensive for the area.I would recommend this game to someone who has a kid that can burn many hours on it, but as far as JRPGs go, I think your time is better spent elsewhere."

It plays well on keyboard or mouse. Windowed or full screen.  There is casual or normal mode. The story is nicely thought out. the characters are a bit limited in you cant choose which skills or abilities or stats to raise. You do however have a nice and humorous selection of characters-people and animals :) I am five hours in to the game and I dont know where the time went. The sounds are well done, not annoying or such. The graphics are classic retro in style of earlier final fantasy games. The combat is turn based. There are set combats and random combats to keep the game interesting.  The combats can be tough when it comes to the bosses, you need to be set up well and think out what to do, not just hack and slash style combat. I found no bugs, glitches, crashes or screen freezes what so ever. However the end fight is unbalanced and for me unbeatable and this game is so confusing in parts..I never googled up a game for help as much as I did this one."
,Recommended,277470,10185878,"Posted: 21 May, 2014",all,Submarine_SantaFe,"The Book of Legends is a great RPG that has massive replay value.  I almost NEVER replay games more than once because I have only limited time.  However, the Book of Legends was enjoyable enough that it makes me want to replay to see a different ending and try out different characters.  I highly recommend this game if you enjoy unique characters, meaningful player decisions, important party decisions and an oldschool style of difficulty that features some tough boss fights and requires a bit of leveling up.What sets this game apart from others is the fact that you make actual meaningful decisions that can affect the plot, your party's competition, and the ending.  There are 31 characters in the game (some are well hidden) and you get to pick who to allow to join you, who to use, who to level up etc.  It's pretty interesting and it isn't simply about leveling up the ""4 best"" characters.  Some boss battles require you to have 2 or even 3 parties of 4 characters so your choices about who to pair together adds an element of strategy.  In the first few hours of the game, decisions you make will actually affect you throughout the game, which is pretty rare to see these days.Each of the characters have interesting personalities and are pretty unique.    They have fun personalities and the dialogue between them is often funny and usually interesting and well written.   The main character is a bit of a jerk and very sarcastic with often hilariously rude replies.   The plot itself is quite good and there's lots of sidequests. I finished the game in about 39 hours, completing 8 of the 27 quests.  I also did some optional stuff in the arena.  The speedrun for beating the game is 20 hours or less, but I recommend taking your time and it would be pretty difficult without building up a few extra levels as well.  There's lots of NPCs to talk to in each town and lots of side paths to explore in both the dungeons and world map.The Book of Legends reminds me of an oldschool RPG in that it can be quite difficult.  Combat can be pretty challenging, especially bosses.  Even when I thought I'd powerleveled quite a bit for a boss fight, I'd end up getting a challenging fight so that was enjoyable.  When you reach a new area on the map, the regular enemies are pretty tough but as you level, they get easier.  Combat itself is pretty good.  There's a nice ""rush"" feature that lets you stomp easy enemies quickly,the characters have quite a few skills and it is cool to try different combinations of parties.  You also have the choice of trying to keep all of your characters high level, or just focusing on certain characters.The world itself is quite huge, dungeons are big and sometimes require multiple visits to get all the way through.  There are many hidden areas in the game.  Finding hidden secrets in dungeons and even on the world map is fun and rewarding.  It is also worth noting that there is a strategy guide available for sale on Adorlea's website.  I finished the game without it, but I did read up on the forums a few times.  I played the game in ""RPG"" mode which is the more difficult version of the two.As far as negatives, I would say that the first hour of the game is actually the worst.  For a long time, I was lost in the forest with a stupid dead rooster, wandering aimlessly.   Luckily, the game gets a LOT better.  Also, you can get a free sample of the strategy guide which has a map of the forest, which I found was the most confusing map in the game.   The economy in this game is VERY tight.  The best weapons and armor are EXPENSIVE and even getting enough healing and magic potionscan be pretty expensive.   Also, due to the difficulty of bosses, you'll need to grind levels for both money and xp.  This can be a bit dull, but it was pretty much the norm for old school RPGs so I didn't mind it too much.  I probably spent about 3 to 4 hours building levels and getting money (while raising up weaker characters as well) out of the 39 hours played.There are a few optional bosses that are really really tough and the game doesn't necessarily warn you about it, which I didn't like.  (The cave early in the game is the worst offender) Just remember to save before a boss and that you cannot beat everything right when you fight it. Some stuff you have to come back for later.Overall, the Book of Legends is a real gem of an RPG.  The unique characters, humor, strategic party composition, important player decisions, solid plot, and massive replayability make this game stand out.   There's a bit too much grinding but the end result is well worth it.  The only game I could compare this to might be Suikoden V, due to the amount of playable characters in both games.  However, the characters in BoL have more personality and you get to choose which ones to use in a more impactful way.  Highly recommended-  9 / 10!"

I had relented and bought it after the game kept showing up on my store front page ""recommended because you play games with ____ tags"" Sometimes you can find great games with those prompts. Other times you get......thisThis game is so broken the only way to win is to take advantage of its own innate brokenness. It's barely functional and reeks of lazyness. The writing feels like it came from a high schooler, the musical score is nonexistant to forgettable, the plot is basic, the enemies aren't recolors they're resizes, and even the very BEST ending you can get with the romantic love interest on the store page is to marry her, have a kid, and get divorced years later.Seriously. They ♥♥♥♥ing wrote in that you get divorced in the good ending. What the ♥♥♥♥  What......the ♥♥♥♥.I unlocked over 20 characters and there is zero balance between them. You'll either get a new character who is vastly below the party's level, or who is ten levels over and will one shot everything. Dump all your stats into the new character flavor of the hour. It carries on with introducing new op secret (mandatory if you want to win the game) characters all the way to the end.Every single boss battle includes fighting a marathon of his drones in a row before you get to him. Every single one. The rules seem to make themseleves up as they go along! Dungeons are entirely too long and once you kill a boss you have to manually backtrack out of it uuuuuuuuuughThe developer clearly played plenty of games, going so far as to joke when you'd check an obvious area for an item. My favorite line from him was ""It's just an ordinary fox statue in an otherwise empty room. There's no reason to think there'd be an item insi, oh wait there's an item nevermind."" I love the sheer volume of secrets, his snarky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ personality, and I secretly enjoy the huge variety of allies including a ♥♥♥♥ing TIGERThe final deciding factor that tips this game into negative territory is...*adjusts glasses*The dialog boxes are loaded with asterisk verbs like the line above."

This is valid, I think, because the problems are exactly same.I gave these games a genuine try, but everything by Aldorlea has the same set of problems. Horrible level design, the most god awfully boring and unsatisfying stories, TONS of HUD problems, and a single goddamn music track for each game. The only redeeming qualities these games have is the art (one of the games has some humor as well); but unless you have a damn fetish single poses for each character, you're gonna be disappointed.

The dialogue was ok but probably contained a bit too many jokes and lacked seriousness, Though I did enjoy the jokes. The difficulty curve was probably the worst part. It was harder early on and a small part of the middle. But later on it became too easy and the bosses were way too easy.I loved that you could get lots of animals to join your party.To sum it up:A fun game but the difficulty curve needs improvements."

,Recommended,277470,14797835,"Posted: 8 March, 2015",all,LyriLee,"On one hand, this game has a lot going for it. The main character is a little annoying, but in a likable way for the most part. The flavor text for checking random things in the environment and responses to NPCs are very enjoyable and I think what really makes this game worth the play through. It's also rather expansive. I can normally keep track of the map of a dungeon in my mind as I play through an RPG, but most areas in this game are so large that I can't do that in TBoL. I like to explore everything, so it lead to me being really overleveled at the end of the game.There is nothing special about the combat. There are a couple of fights that you have to figure out the tricks to win them, but all and all, very run of the mill. You occassionally have to split your party to take care of multiple fights at once, I found that more annoying than innovative, but that's just my own 2 cents.I will say some of the character interaction is just downright silly. You beat a boss, and then you're given the option to kiss one of your team mates. No, that's a terrible way to do that. This does not happen in normal interaction with people. You don't just kiss people because YOU want to. They should have added some text that suggests the character would like to kiss you as well, and then give you the choice. It's a two person action, and I find it almost borderline offensive that it's handled the way it is. But that really is its only flaw. And I'm sure many people played it without taking issue with that portion."

The main character has a very sarcastic humour that makes me laugh every now and then. The story is classic, but well done. The difficulty is balanced, with some combats very challenging if not prepared. There are a lot of hidden things to find out, a lot of playable characters you can get in your team (some hidden ones too, and sometimes only recrutable in a given period of time), so you can go through some playthrough and experience different things (a few characters can only be recruited by leaving other behind; there are at least two moments where you have to decide between some characters of others).On the other side, there are some flaws in my point of view : the impossibility to ajust the image ratio in fullscreen, some information not clearfully displayed (like, in combat, you can't see what is the max hp or mp the character has, but only the current amount he has), some status not explained (there is a big variety of status you can get or inflict in combat, some classic and well known, like paralyse, poisoned, silenced, but other original and you can't always tell what they do, like lost, scared, ... ; also, you have more caracteristics than in most games, without really knowing their effects, like you have physical defence and magic defence, but you also have resistance, an it might be difficult to choose which one is the most important and therefore, choice of armors and accessories can be difficult).Overall, there is a good complexity, a lot of searching for those seeking to find everything, a good story, despite not very original and a good gameplay, despite a lack of explanation on some features.

While I don't flat out hate it, it just got to the point where I just quit caring what was going on.  The main couple of issues with it, I feel, are:-Way too many hidden/secret items.  I enjoy how retro games hide items here or there.  But this game PRIDES itself on it.  It just got to the point where I quit caring because I was tired of clicking on every little thing.-The storyline is pretty bland.  I understand that the creators took the time to make this game in RPGMaker and had a story they wanted to tell.  Sadly, it never clicked with me.  Some of the reviews said the game was/is humorous.  If it is, it was mostly lost on me cause, I don't think I laughed once.-Here's something else.  When I decide to review a game, I like to play and see all of it.  So I looked into the official guide for this game.  Now its cost $6, which I refused to buy.  Why?  $6 isn't bad for an offical guide but its WORTHLESS.  The only reason you could possibly need a guide for in this game would be to find all the secret/hidden items.  Well, the guide DOESN'T DO THAT.As a musican, freelance voice actor, youtube video and amatur film maker.   I get this is a indie effort.  I'm not hating on that.

I've enjoyed what I've played story wise so far, battle system is nice.  I've just found myself getting really bored with it due to the constant grinding.  It is one of those deals in which you get more people than you can have in a party, certain parts of the game you have to run more than 1 party which means way more than the normal grinding.  Quick summary-Pros -  Good story, I enjoyed the writing with the main character being an♥♥♥♥♥ but there is more to him.-  Seemed like a good sized world.-  Battle system easy to pick up and strategize with.Cons - Too grindy, I'm guessing to give it more playtime?  I am level 35 with 2 parties worth and I'm kind of stuck.-  This makes the grinding worse, not a lot of weapons to buy, they are pricy, after running a dung. I could buy 1 weapon in next area.    Shops with gear is far and between and your weapon goes to crap quick, limited on going back to old areas if you couldn't afford the gear the first time through.Over all, meh.

There's no way to avoid it and considering that many of the dungeons are mazes, the chance that the player has to backtrack paths is very high and hence even more boring battles with endless minions. The actual battle system is the typical I power up and hit you, you hit me, I heal sort of routine so it's really not much fun.

That is, until I moved on, away from the main land the game starts on. Suddenly, the game went from LOLERSKATE city difficulty (even on HARD) to MELT FACE!!! Difficulty, without so much as a 'by the way, YOU""RE GONNA DIE OUT THERE!!', beforehand.IOW: The first 2 or so hours are actually worth playing. That is until it becomes IMPOSSIBLE to play....Full Review Points:Pro:- Charming Banter:This is the first RPGMaker game I've played that gets the banter on point, and in character, most of the time. Combined with meeting some really ODD people in the world, I had to list this as a pro.- Exploration Encouraged:This is a mixed bag, as you may find yourself obsessed with checking every possible object in the game for potential loot... OR you can do what I did, and simply check the ones on your route and ignore the rest. I still managed to find 2 extra party members and several equipment upgrades this way, so I figure it’s a bonus worth a pro.- Open World Questing:This is the FIRST RPGMaker game I've played that allowed for side quests to be completed BEFORE you know about them. At least two of them, I didn't even know I had completed until I met the NPC that gave them. The banter even included the surprise that the player accepted a quest they knew they had already completed, and how wrong it felt... This is something more games should do.Con:- The intro forest is WAY TO LONG, WAY TO BIG, and WAY TO EASY:It sets up the player to expect a cake walk, only to be insulted and smacked in the face for their trouble, by the time the actual difficulty curve sets in.- Overpowered until Underpowered:The main character is WAY overpowered until suddenly he isn't, and it occurs without ANY warning. And good luck keeping your optional party members alive... It’s a practice in frustration, and futility.- No Fast Travel or Sprinting:Back tracking is a problem... There are no easy exits to ANY area. And at least one quest had you re-enter an area you already cleared AGAIN to find a new hidden object. It is lame... LAME. But forgivable. It wouldn't be so bad if the back tracking was for a GOOD REASON and had worth wile rewards. But it doesn't.- Grinding Required:Equipment upgrades are few and far between. Optional party members join your party at extremely LOW level, requiring a ton of grinding if you hope to keep them alive longer than ONE hit, and that is BEFORE the difficulty spike from hell.- The intro, is BADDLY translated... Or filled with lazy typo's. Both possibilities are terrible."

The cast of playable characters is huge, and also hilarious.  Due to this, and the fact that there are plenty of sidequests and hidden content, it has great replayability.  The game has some pretty good humor as well.  Pokes fun at the genre as a whole, and I've even found a few pop culture references hidden away.This game can be very challenging at points, even on the casual mode, but overall it's not too bad.  I found that it wasn't really grindy either, which is always a plus in an RPG.  As great as this game is, I would love to see them do a game without the RPG maker.  I almost felt like it held them back on a game like this and it could have been even better, but still certainly worth playing through (multiple times).  Overall, I would definitely recommend that people pick this one up and give it a try."

Especially considering that Final Fantasy VI is my all time favorite video game ever.  So when an RPG Maker game comes even halfway to the point of FFVI's brilliance, it's worth playing.  Granted, I haven't played a ton of this game so far and may update my review later.  Additionally, I'm only playing in Casual Mode, so I can't speak to the RPG Mode's balance/grinding aspect.  (I don't have nearly as much time for games as I did in my youth, so the Casual Mode saves a lot of time for my adulting responsibilities.)  Only down side for me so far is that the main character is a complete jerk.  Fine narrative, but I tend not to root for these kinds of characters.  Aside from that, there's lots to explore, side quests, and even a rooster companion.  My ultimate point is that I've spent money on giving other RPG Maker games a chance in the past and gave up on some within minutes.  The fact that I want to complete this game speaks volumes."

,Not Recommended,277470,12747680,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,TheCyclon,"These are only my first impressions (I've played for about 2 hours):First of all, would I recommend it? To some people, yeah but not for most. There seem to be a good amount of choices to be made (I don't know how much they affect the story but they seem to have a pretty big effect on the dialogue). Also, there are lots of things you can miss so if you're into that kind of stuff then this game might be for you. So far the combat has been pretty much nothing but smashing the action button but I am playing on the easier mode so that probably has something to do with it.The writing isn't great and so far the story seems pretty uninteresting. Not much to say about that. If you're expecting serious dialogue you're going to be disappointed as there doesn't seem to be much of that.Also, it's an RPGmaker game so don't expect graphics settings. Or pretty much any settings.The music is pretty horrible.Lots of sidequests.The control scheme is extremely odd. It has the standard JRPG arrow keys, action button and back/menu thing but the action button is enter and the back/menu button is esc... But C and X seem to work too so that's good (and by the way you can't rebind the keys, at least not in-game) Oh and you can also control it with a mouse but I don't really know about that. And my x360 controller kinda worked too. Kinda.I bought it when it was on sale for 75% off. I don't think I would recommend paying the full price. Actually, I definitely wouldn't recommend that.Soo if it's not 75% off right now, wait. Also, you might want to check out some other JRPGs on steam before you go for this one."

By that point, I had no more desire to play anyway.I wanted to like this game, but the main character is so overpowered that there is no challenge early into the game, until almost two hours in when the difficulty spikes to the point that only the main character is of any use and the rest of the party are just a meat shields.As if that weren't enough, the game won't let you cast your spells that attack all enemies when they would be useful. Couldn't use the spell when I was facing seven enemies, but I could when there was only one!

I'm tired of him already and I don't think I've ever wanted a main character to die so quickly and so painfully...

Sadly, with the way the game is designed, that seems very likely to happen.Overall:- Game looks like it was developed using basic RPG Maker tilesets, sounds and music.- Seemingly intentional bad game design.- Story is fairly predictable.- Writing didn't go through and editing process.My Opinion?

Here's the good.  The character art is pretty nice and the sprites, while definitely RPG maker, are different than what we are used to with the Asian themes.  However.  Combat is painfully boring.  I like the fact that the developers are up front with people about when you will encounter battles and Jordan, our lead, has some cool abilities, but it's basically, spam attack until they die for far too long.  You can get lots of characters, but....that doesn't make them all good...or even fun.  The music is pretty forgettable too...Asian themed, but just not interesting or energetic enough to keep my playing.I will say, I wish this was better, cause I like the story and character dynamics.  Jordan isn't a hero or an anti-hero, but kind of just a rude♥♥♥♥♥♥..who is still likable.  He has a code of honor against thieves, prefers staves because he never wanted to be a professional fighter even if he is the strongest guy in the world, and has plenty of snarky interactions with other characters and items, particularly Jasmine, who often insults him for his stupidity.  But, the story moves too slow and the grammar on display here is laughable.If this game had a lot more polish and was more interesting to actually play, combatwise, I'd recommend it.  As is, only try it if you are a big fan and can tolerate RPG maker-esque games.  There are better games on Steam you could be playing."
