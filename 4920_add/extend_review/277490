Yes, the 1980 classic gets some rennovations in Bane's side-scroller action shooter, though the ""side-scrolling"" is simulated but still a game that really tests your timing and prediction skills. Best played with a touchscreen but works equally as well with a gaming mouse or decent track pad or track ball (my fav). It's a fun little escape game, that will have you going ""just one more time."" At $8, its worth the price, on sale - it's a ""no pass up.""Graphics = Decent (runs smooth on my i5-HD3000 lappie)Sounds = Very good (immursive)Gameplay = Missle Command style ShooterReplayability = Yes (in challenges this game presents)Controls = Yes (just point and click, the rest is up to you)"

And for that purpose Battle Group 2 is perfect.We command two ships. One shoots missiles while the other does the support i.e. provides us with abilities in order to eliminate the oncoming projectiles / missiles. There is a cool down for every missile we shoot and each ability we use - this requires some tactics on our end especially towards the end game.We have some upgrades for the ships and newer, bigger, better warships can be purchased. The currency is oil which we obtain after each and every completed mission. This is a typical game with grinding - we can repeat levels as many times as we want and we can have the best equipment before we begin the endgame.Do note that Battle Group 2 is the port of a mobile game. It really is a simple game with simple (yet sufficient) graphics and fast-paced, exciting gameplay. For a couple of euros this is an excellent purchase."

Through the game you play the role of the weapons controller for the main ship as it sets sail through various seas and channels as an onslaught of enemies try to take you down.  The enemy leader as many have pointed out will bring memories of Cobra Commander as your captain exchanges words with him.  All in all it kept me entertained and if by watching the video and looking at the screenshots it looks like something you could enjoy then go for it.Gameplay Control Points:1: You do not have to steer the ship, you only fire the main ship's weaponry. (Ammo recharges.)2: As you progress through the game  abilities become available for purchase & use: Reload 1/mission I think, EMP as many as you own, and time slow which is also as many as you own.  Time slow drastically decreases game speed while increasing missile ROF, speed, and recharging.3: You may unlock better ships with fuel from mission completions.4: You may unlock support ships with fuel as well, these have 1-2 activatable weapons with a shots & time limit to them before they go into cooldown.5: The controls are very simple and easy to use, I would recommend most people rebind them as they see fit.  The one trick to the game is strategic use of abilities and proper pacing and accuracy/leading of enemy targets when firing the weapons."

Graphically Battle Group 2 is better, but the levels are very short and are only made challenging by the volume of missile spam.

You don't move, you simply mow down defenders before they can reach you, much like the good old ""Missile Command"" except your perspectives shift a bit: enemies can now come from the sides, top, bottom, even from behind. AND you get a secondary ship with some fancy stuff like missile decoy, escort fighters, and so on. And then there are special abilities such as satellite support (i.e. zap all the missiles or all the enemies at once), then there are the boss fights.Basically you control this one ship (and an optional support ship) and you run into some very very fancy terrorists called Talon (clearly modeled after GI Joe's ""Cobra"") with a LOT of weapons and planes and ships... and you need to shoot as many of them as you can. Easy enough? Except your ammo doesn't reload instantly (your clip size is limited) and you need to ""lead"" the enemy fighters / missiles / ships / bombs / etc. This was originally a touchscreen game on iOS and Android, and somehow doesn't play quite as good on mouse, IMHO.Graphics are decent for 2D sprite game, sound is a bit of ""meh"". it won't blow you away, for sure.Still, if you need some arcade-y action (never mind the hokey storyline, like helo gunships 'escorting' an airliner) then give it a try. It's cheap, it's exciting, and it's a break from the FPS and RTS and such games. AND it's cheap."

,Recommended,277490,10517347,"Posted: 18 June, 2014",all,Unzen,"Imagine playing the originalMissile Commandgame where you defended your cities from incoming threats. Now place that same game concept against a naval back-drop where your ships (or ships) are coming under attack.Seen from directly above, BG2 focuses on quick reactions and that constant battle between overwhelming firepower and conserving your ammunition. Your task is to fend off inbound enemies from your vessels by a arch-rival known only as The Talon. Each ship has a weapons system that reloads and recharges over time. Larger ships tend to have more health, but they can be upgraded at the end of each level, using resources gained from destroying inbound bogeys and bonuses through killstreaks.The level of unit detail is really quite impressive. Any military g33k will immediately recognise B2 Spirit's, Tu-95 Bears, Su-25 Frogfoots - to name but a few. Some targets move quickly, others more docile. Some take a couple of hits, some can destroyed with a single shot. You can also have more than one ship in your immediate flotilla - mixing and matching each ships capabilities to maximise your chances of success.Overall BG2 is a straight forward and very rewarding game to play. Easy to pickup and play - there are many combinations available to the player in terms of how to proceed. One of those games that's great when you have 10 minutes spare.8.5/10"

I probably will play it again but it feels like one of those games to play when you're really bored. If you played stuff like Missle Command when you were a kid and loved it you'll like this. You control ships and click where enemies are heading to send out your missles and catch them. The descriptions for the ships you can purchase using oil, the game's currency, is really vague so you'll probably buy some stuff you don't like thinking it'll be an upgrade to what you currently have since it's cost is higher. It states the ship's abilities, just no description as to what the abilities do. I haven't played very much but it's a pretty simple game. Aim, shoot, buy, slightly upgrade, accidentally downgrade.

You are in command of a gunship that finds itself being attacked by a mysterious organization called “The Talon” which is very reminiscent of Cobra from GI Joe. After a short tutorial, they threaten an airliner and you are forced to give them your ship. Out for revenge, you start level one with a much smaller ship, and start hunting down the Talon. Some humorous dialogue aside there really isn’t much to the game’s plot, and with good reason.. Battle Group embraces an old arcade style sensibility and is really all about the game play.When it comes to games like these all that really matter is gameplay, and in that aspect Battle Group 2 delivers. If you are looking for a fun game to play in short bursts. Or if you just want arcade style fun, you can do a lot worse for the $7.99 it’ll cost you to pick Battle Group 2 up."

It's worth $4 priced at $1 / hour of fun.You play a gunner, on a ship that is captained by a lovely and competent young woman. The enemy faction is named Talon and headed by a guy who wears a red tablecloth on his head. Talon delights in hijacking airplanes and your ship. You have to defend against small bomber planes, fighters, stealth bombers, helicopter gunships, 747's, small inflatables and various missiles.The challenge comes from the fact that your captain is steering the ship from left to right and the enemy tends to attack right to left and eventually from all directions. Your missile launcher holds a maximum of 5 missiles ( before needing to reload ) and different enemies can take 1,2 or 3 shells before they are destroyed. You have to prioritize targets and make judgements, based on relative velocity, regarding the impact point of when and where your missiles will hit.You can use barrels of oil, to purchase friendly ships, that will sail beside you. You can purchase power ups such as one that will slow down time."

The plot is bare-bones, having only you and your captain facing off against the ""Talon"", suspiciously similar to another evil organization. The Talon has a huge fleet of everything from B-2s to speedboats, and you have to sink it. The gameplay is very simple, consisting of clicking the mouse (you can't steer), and clicking on power ups or special abilities. The way to deal missiles is to either trigger a power-up or shoot them down.Though there is skill involved, this can be mitigated with power-ups. By the end of the game, I was just replaying earlier levels to grind for cash, buying power-ups, and using them to make it through the harder end levels. Because of this, the game isn't deep at all and has little replay value, but is a good way to spend several hours."

Not optional. Not in the slightest. You're going to notice early on that your performance is kind of hamstrung by the fact that ALL of your ships have an absolutely abysmal reload rate, and the only way you're going to remotely keep up with the increasing onslaughts that the enemies throw at you is to upgrade your clip sizes and reload rates to the max as early on as you can - and when I say reload rate, I don't mean the reload rates for your main gun, which you cannot upgrade the reload rate of by any means.Well, that's not so bad, you may say, doesn't that add to the challenge of the game?It does. Right up until you start realizing that you are literally having too many enemies and missiles thrown at you to shoot down unless you buy a lot of expensive single-use powerups, and I mean expensive as in ""you will have to grind entire early-to-mid-game missions at least once to buy a single pack of the only truly useful one"", and that's not even factoring what it's going to take to get the late-game ships and upgrades that, again, you're absolutely going to NEED in order to stand a chance.Basically, you can't beat this game without grinding like crazy, and that's not challenging. It's a timesink and nothing more. It's really too bad, because there's really not much wrong with the game itself - it's simple, good, lead-the-target fun that allows you the chance to negate all damage if you're quick and accurate enough... at least until the game starts throwing too much at you to handle without the need for powerups. I did beat the game, but I didn't four-star every mission, and the ending isn't worth it. I have my doubts that 100%ing the game is worth the time it'll take to beat it, and I personally can't recommend this game unless you wait for a rather hardcore discount; it's not worth eight dollars."

The simple yet enjoyable gameplay is enhanced with a variety of unique ships each with their own set of upgrades.  The levels get progressively more difficult, and will require more skill when placing of your shots."

,Recommended,277490,18299950,"Posted: 2 October, 2015",all,neoadorable,"The best take on the Missile Command design that I've ever played - with a nice variety of warships. If you like big boats and fast action, this is a must, especially at the prices Steam is selling it, which is typically next to free. You can't control the ships, simply aim missiles at targets and use a cool selection of special powers like bullet time, screen bomb, etc. There's also a pretty fun upgrade path for your main ship and the escort, which is necessary to invest in as missions get progressively harder and move into bullethell territory.The story is intentionally late 80's/early 90's coin op arcade-simple. It pokes obvious fun at the likes of Zero Wing with a ridiculous villain that spouts bravado about your impending doom only to get thrashed every time. Lots of fun, nothing too grandiose, but you'll enjoy it. 8/10."

Did a little research and it appears that late June/early July the devs said they were working on it, however as of 08/04/14 the mac version still does not save. If you like arcade style games it is very fun and quite addicting IMO. I would definitely buy it and play it a little, then maybe wait for an update (it gets very annoying playing for and hour and then having to restart all over again)"

The game boasts some very nice graphics (especially the warships) and some interesting sound design (especially in the menus), and is overall a fun, small game. If you want something that looks like Capcom's 1942, (I bought the game solely because it reminded me of custom naval units like the Arm Yamato for Total Annihilation back in the day), and plays as simply as your average tower defense game, you might enjoy this game. There is some nice music, but not enough of it. After the first few missions the game doesn't really change too much, but unlocking ships (with their unique weapons) is a rewarding enough reason to keep playing.I recommend this game, but I'd add the caveat that only if it appeals to you, and if it is on sale."

It's really fun for about 40 mins before it gets a bit repetetive but it's a great casual timewaster/bullet hell kinda shooter. If you ever played Missile Command on Atari, then you are familiar with this. Lots of upgrades but they are pretty much on a standard set path without the ability to really deviate and no different strategies to employ, but it's $3 and it has slick production. Just do it!"

You can also shoot buildings for extra oil.-You also have (if you upgrade your ship / purchase a support ship) weapon icons, which you click on to activate, that help with shooting down whatever is being currently thrown at you.-You can purchase new ships and support ships, which have different weapons (you'll know the loadout before you buy it).I'd recommend getting it on mobile if you have a mobile phone that can run it, as this game was clearly meant for that platform. Otherwise get it on sale."

Instead of defending cities, you're battling through hordes of aircraft, missiles, and suicide boats using the weapons featured on the boat(s) you're using.  Each boat is upgradable, and some weapons are automatic, some are controlled manually.It's a cheap game - just over a fiver - but does give you quite a bit of gameplay, and getting the achievements will take some time.  (There are guides on Steam to help you.)If you're looking for deep strategy, look elsewhere, but as a fun arcade experience, you could do a lot worse than give this a try."

You can't move around and you can buy boats by ""oil barrels"" You have to kill enemies or building in order to get those. A higher streak will give you more Oil. You can also upgrade the boats.  You can get a streak if you kill enemies, however if u shoot miss the streak will be broken. You can have 2 boats and one is a Support boat and the other one is you.The game has some audio voices. but not that much.You can get up to 3 stars but this is only for 100% completion on a level.You have some abilities to slow down time.Pretty Repetitive.Other things.Discount recommended.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10"
