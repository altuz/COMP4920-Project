There are lots of flaw in this game for example:- No auto-feed for livestocks so you have to feed them by clicking. Imaging you have like 10+ barns- Kinda broken. You can earn a lot of money from selling produced food e.g steak and chicken meat. There is no need to plant any crop- AI is way stupid. It will do almost nothing. You will feel like you're playing alone.- No way to cure disease for your crop!?- Background music is lame and repeatitive- No shortkeys so you have to click everything (Facebook style)- Way too easy to play. And you have to collect more stars to unlock more stuff with aren't worth unlocking.The only good thing about this game is it tells you the suitable temperature for each crop so you might be able to try to plant them in real life (I guess). That's all I could think of...Sorry for my bad English..

I'd rather watch real grass grow. half an hour to harvest one small field that yielded 50.6 percent after tender care. There are so many other sims on Steam that deserve your money, Game Dev Tycoon, Cars Incorporated, for example, not this one. 1990's graphics, no way to adjust screen resolution, miniature text. A huge waste of money. Unless you're living in 1995 then it would seem brand new."

I would dissect the game's mechanics to point out where and how it went wrong, but there are no mechanics to dissect aside from waiting for a crop to finish and then waiting some more.If you want a farm game that's more interesting, get Sim Farm from somewhere.

,Recommended,277500,9999157,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,Guttenkrieger,"It's a decent farming game. The graphics look very outdated, reminded me of early simulators like SimFarm, but if you are a fan of the genre, it probably won't matter that much.The gameplay is pretty straight forward, going away from the ""driving farming machinery"" approach that some current simulators take and focusing on timing the planting acording to the season and planing when to sell the crops.There's a problem with the DEP registering that prevents the game from running. If you are experiencing this, try add the game executable to the DEP exception list and it should solve the issue.I would recommend this if you are already a fan of the genre or if you don't mind the simple graphics."
76561197971948490,Not Recommended,277500,13109581,"Posted: 27 November, 2014",all,Wraith_Magus,"This was a game I thought might be some light fun as a management game, and had hopes it would be patched to enjoyable state, but as it now seems abandoned by the developer, I have to say that in its ""final"" state, it is not recommendable to virtually anyone.Gameplay consists of designating land for specific crops, punching buttons to get someone else to drive the tractor and do all the work, and then hitting fast forward for several days in a row until it's time to punch the next button.  It plays in ""real time"", but EVERYTHING happens at noon, so there's no point in any other time of day.  It's not even like there's so much to do that your tractors might not complete a field in 24 hours, either.  When the requisite time has been fast forwarded, you punch the ""harvest"" button, and the picker hoarde zooms through your fields, and you make freakishly large amounts of money.  Rinse and repeat forever.Many of the game features don't even work.  There are ""contracts"" where you can take functional missions to supply specific amounts of product by a specific time... but the button to actually complete a contract was never implemented.  There are ""rival farmers"" you are supposed to ""beat"", but they basically decide by throwing darts at a chart of options blindfolded.  Basically, all you do is plant crops and harvest, and use the money to buy more fields you can plant more crops within.There are also features that exist, but serve no particular purpose.  There is a weather system, with supposed storms coming through (although you can't actually SEE any storms, there are no effects whatsoever but that your crops mysteriously die) but you can't even tell without looking at the weather report menu.  Since there's literally nothing you can do about the weather anyway, though, there's no reason to do anything but fast forward through them.  There is a star-based unlocking system, but that only serves to make sure you have less variety in your game than you already had.  You get stars by harvesting crops, which is the only way you make money, so there's no reason it couldn't have been based upon money, anyway.  It only exists this way because Farmville did it, even though it serves no purpose here. Worse, it hides what the actual money price of something will be until AFTER you pay the star costs.  Hence, you have to plan your management of your farm around having to pay construction and upkeep costs on a factory whose real costs you can't see until AFTER you invested something in it.Then there are critically lacking features, like being able to see the prices of crops so that you can strategically plan what you are going to sell before you have actually invested all the time and money into growing them.  Yes, that's right, it's a game about picking what crops to grow for the maximum profit *WHERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA AT WHAT PRICE ANYTHING COSTS OR SELLS*.  The statistics page is utterly useless, as it shows you absolutely nothing of value, like what fields cost what amount of money to grow anything (you have to track that by hand), and what the crops sold for when you did grow them. You have factories that let you turn raw fruit into canned fruit or other similar intermediate or finished products, but there's no comparison of overhead to finished product and raw material selling prices.This is a management game where you have nothing to actually manage.  There is no strategy here, all land is basically the same (even fertility differences are just papered over with punching a button to ""fertilize field""), the whole map is one flat chunk of arable land, no matter where in the world you set up, and climate, once picked, basically ensures you will spend the whole game raising strawberries or potatoes or corn or whatever ad infinitum.  No thought, just micromanage those buttons to keep sending out tractors to plow, plant, spray, or harvest before fast-forwarding to the next time to do more of the same.Ultimately, the game is like playing Candyland with yourself.  You roll the dice, have random crap happen to you that you can't do anything about, and then eventually progress further down the board and maybe declare ""you win"" when you get bored... but this game lacks the finish line, so..."

The graphics are extremely subpar, the tutorial left me lacking for how to do things, which come to find out you can't even turn the buildings.  There is no way to see prices without actually having taken the time to grow a crop, which takes at least 15 mins real time to do.

Much harder than to succeed.The most interesting feature I've found was the ability to cut meat out of your animals without killing them. That must be horribly painful and animal rights groups might find this disturbing. But it's an interesting thought. And is balanced by the fact that after the animals reach a certain age they gain civil rights and retirement rights, after which they can no longer be sold or cut.Farming is ridiculously easy (you rent everything and still get >100% profits), animal harvesting is easier.It's so easy that if you notice turkey meat sells for more than beef, you can set your butcher to cut your cattle into turkey meat.TL;DR: it's too easy, devs didn't pay much attention to details and the game gets boring after 10 minutes (that's counting the download time)."

The first annoying thing you will notice is the camera is lacking. You can't zoom out very far, cannot rotate view, and even on the closest zoom you will strain your eyes just to see your people working. It's not a very flawed game though, and if you like this sort of genre you will definitely have a lot of fun. But, seeing how it borrows heavily from previous farm management sims, you will probably wish you could play those again instead. This game sports some unique features, but at the same time you will wish it had some that were available in older games of this type. For this reason I would highly recommend ""John Deere: American Farmer"" or ""SimFarm"".Farming World is still a nice game, however."

There are large amounts of time where all you can do is wait, which is annoying. Also it's very unclear how to actually make money in this game. For example, I took a contract to make apples, which I did, but for some reason it still said I hadn't fulfilled the contract. I have no idea what I did wrong and the game is not clear at all on how to improve."

I really wanted to like it, I really did. It is not figured out! As in I Bet my life on the fact that the creators of this game have never tried playing it.If you buy animals you have to sit next to them during the entire game to fix broken fences.Most hated is the fact the whenever ANYTHING happens, you get an alert and lose your fast forward.Crop planting is ridiculous..... Just dont buy it. It sucks......Moving on to find something else..."

The overall user rating concerned me, but I figured it would be hard to go wrong at 54 cents.Likes:good idea for game - seems like a farming tycoon gamelots of crops and products to makevariety of environments to farm inAnnoyances:could use a clickable minimap for navigationcould use an approaching events list - tracking everything gets hecticthe music is monotonous after awhilethe fences are in need of constant repairbalance - some things will make you instantly wealthy, others will quickly bankrupt youBugs:sound effects stop functioning after some play timesome minor graphical glitchesscrolling the contracts window changes the contract details even though the game is pausedsome achievements broken - completed many contracts but made no progress on the contract achievementsIts an older game, so I don't expect that the developers will fix any of these problems. It's to bad. This could be a interesting tycoon style game. Cheap as it is, without some fixes I wouldn't pay full price for this game."
