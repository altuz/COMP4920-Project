It clearly tries to be as notoriously difficult as those games, but in some ways that doesn't work in its favor. Often times though, it does. The puzzles can be pretty esoteric, but none worse than some of those games. The controls are clunky. Not ""clunky at times"" just flat out clunky. But, they get the job done.I really do like this game. The asthetic is perfect, and while I don't like the controls, I like the general idea and most of its execution. I want more first person ""infinite pockets, use every item on everything"" adventure games, and I think this a great place to start from.Story is good and simple like those games as well, fits the atmosphere entirely.Honestly, if you think you might like it, you probably will."

Most of the time I've spent playing has been bumbling about looking at the levels because the gameplay isn't exactly friendly and most of the progression is based on arbitrary tasks, half of which I couldn't guess to save my life. I tried to avoid a guide for as long as possible but unless you're willing to spend hours in the same room progressing very little or not at all, it's impossible not to.Games like this are based on figuring out a specific set of tasks dictated by the specific insanity of whoever made the game, which always results in incredibly confusing and illogical puzzles.Also on my first playthrough the physics on the hose in the second level bonked out so hard I couldn't progress and had to restart.Albedo isn't bad but it's so boring I can't reccommend it."

The mouse wheel is used to scroll horizontally through all the items in your inventory, which you have to do slowly otherwise you can't choose the exact object you want if done too fast.The mouse wheel is also used to scroll through actions when you mouse over or use an object, such as pick up, drop, observe, use with, throw and put in inventory. It makes it hard to do anything quickly which becomes a problem when faced with an aggressive monster you can't kill and can only distract for a short time making it frustrating to play as the monster kept killing me as I can't do anything quick enough.When I went into the room with flames and back again all of a sudden my fps dropped dramatically so I was moving in slow motion. I had to quit and restart the game for the fps to be ok again.The gameplay is rather dull where all you do is just go around finding objects to use on other objects to progress to find more objects and repeat, isn't really my thing. Besides objects on objects there are puzzles which can be quite challenging often taking me a while to figure out.A game that would of been at least a bit of fun with a better UI, but with the UI the game has it makes it unenjoyable and a chore to play. 4/10 as the UI makes the game bad.Don't reccomend, the game is too frustrating to play, not worth playing."

All of it just culminates into this wonderfully weird game that I absolutely love. The puzzle design so far is quite good, and the controls are what I expected them to be; a little wonky, but in a good way. It helps the immersion, so I'm not gonna dock it for that. Really the only thing I'm seeing is the optimization is terrible, but that's to be expected in an early access title.So far, this game gets a great big thumb's up from me. It's a fantastically strange puzzle/horror/comedy game that really scratches the itch for... strange puzzle/horror/comedy games..."

I wasn't sure what to think since it has so many negative reviews but I feel like most of their gripes didn't apply to me at all. I LOVE that it's not holding my hand and that you need to explore the environments to figure out the puzzles. And with the inventory system... it's not really bothering me since I'm using a controller. It feels like he was trying to make the interaction a bit more contextual which was maybe a turn off to a lot. Anyways, I definitely recommend this. It was a great little steal on the Summer Sale.I put up a video review on my channel:https://youtu.be/BCtlr9LLoGE"

What i shall say is this is the most beautiful partially puzzle game I ever seen, beautiful environment, nice details everywhere, awsome atmosphere (oculus rift support would be epic in this game) the physics are okey what I saw, the interaction with the environment is also good, sound effects? Gorgeous. The tools ingame are very original.The devs are communicatives.I can also say that the game is well optimized. I run the game with lower specs PC (3gb memory ram, 750 mb videocard ) than the recommended system requirements, and I run it on max quality, and it runs smoothly (of course my cooler suffers a little bit :P)Okey, i've met with some bugs but is totally okey for EA game.So yes!

Not very much.I'm still trying to shake away the memories of an alien eating the corpse of a human while my character watched with a beer in hand, swilling it down to work up the nerve to break the empty bottle (the only potential weapon in the room) and fight the damn thing to the death.

I honestly do, because it has one of the neatest premises I've seen in a very long time. The art is very 1950's cult sci-fi, the sound design is great, and the premise is a refreshing take on an otherwise stale subject. The puzzles, from what I have been able to see, are well thought-out and require more than just the usual brute-force approach.However, there are two huge problems standing in my way.From a stylistic standpoint, the game has the worst inventory system I have ever borne witness to. It is utterly counterintuitive, awkward, slow and detracts from gameplay. The addition of shortcut keys helps a little, but they're generally unresponsive.But moreso than that, is that the game is broken. THe menus don't respond correctly half the time, puzzles are frequently unresponsive and don't work correctly until the game is reloaded, and important items have, in several instances, clipped through the floor and become irretrievable.I get that one guy did this all, and it was a valiant effort. But maybe it would have been a good idea to have a buddy proofread it."

If it's not too dark to see interactable objects in the game, the puzzles themselves offer very little hints other than highlighting particular objects in a solid green light. I REALLY tried to like this game, and I'm sure once you get past the vague puzzles and dim lighting, it's a humorous game. Even the voice actor sounds terribly bored!"

,Not Recommended,277520,17136490,"Posted: 20 July, 2015",all,Nev,"I really wanted to play this game. It had an interesting premise and looked good from the trailers, but ..It has terrible movement. You randomly change speed, get stuck in small things, clip through large things. It's hard to jump on things. Generally unresponsive.It has a terrible camera. It zooms in way too close when picking up objects and randomly takes control for no reason.It has terrible interactivity. Interacting with objects in the world, with the inventory and performing actions is very glitchy. Sometimes the selected action changes for no reason. Scrolling with the mouse wheel is randomly either too fast or too slow.It has terrible graphics. Maps are either too dark or too bright. There are excessive postprocessing effects like bloom, color correction and grain.It has bugs. I managed to throw an object out of the map. Climbing glitched out while carrying a tube, so I tried throwing it. Instead of landing either where I wanted or on the ground, the object just disappeared.I only completed the first two rooms and got tired of playing because of the above reasons.I bought the game while it was in Early Access, but got around to playing it only now. I don't know what the state of it was back then, but right now it seems glitchy, unpolished and generally incomplete."

Sometimes dragging is the way to select menu items. Sometimes dragging just shifts your view. The same button that highlights interactive objects also gives useless hints. I did click through the multi-page manual that took three pages to show how a left mouse click would select an action to perform on an item. And the several pages to say that right-click + drag selects inventory items [or was it the middle mouse click + scroll?]. Oh, and also use the left mouse button to pull up an action menu. Or something. And the right mouse can click + drag to combine inventory items. Or was that the left mouse again? If you get the impression that the controls are (1) confusing and (2) never do what you want, then you got the picture.If spooky sci-fi is your thing, I would suggest J.U.LI.A. instead of this one.

However all that effort did not deliver a good end product.When I first saw this game during the early access period I was really impressed with the concept and how it stood out from the rest. So I bought it and in order not to ruin the experience waited for it to be fully released.Starting the game I was really enthusiastic and was eager to turn a blind eye on some minor glitches etc. I really wanted to like the game, but after 4 hours of struggle, that was mainly comprised of struggle with horrible interface Inventory controls, I gave up. The game simply does not worth the trouble, the story is week - ""oh no, aliens attack I gotta get from point A to point B"". The puzzles, well, some of them are interesting, but some are just boring and sometimes you simply have to click everything around and see what interact with what. By the end of the fourth hour this became unbearable and I deleted the game.The idea is good, the style is original, but the execution kills the game and at some point the stress that game creates overweights the entertainment component.As such I would say, well done to the man who singlehandedly put so much effort and indeed for a solo project it is quite good, but as a general game, it sucks before the actual gameplay execution and controls kill it.5/10For more reviews join my group -http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/"
76561198173606567,Recommended,277520,32381920,Posted: 12 June,all,KeinSchiesse,"If you're looking for a unique, surreal, somewhat whimsical First Person game, this is it. The game plays more like a point and click adventure game than fast-paced first person action or horror (evading enemies etc..) although you do encounter enemies, you are usually able to put some distance between you and them to then explore the environments for items to use to solve various puzzles. It can be incredibly confusing what you're supposed to do with certain items in the rooms and throughout the areas, as with other adventure point and click style games (I admit I had to use a walkthrough several times..)I am still early in the game but for its marketed retro, sci-fi, sludgy, surreal setting I think it delivers on that and I can say it's unlike any other first person games I've played, to the creator's credit. I was worried it would fall too far into the idle player interaction of walking simulator style games, however, it is much more a first person puzzle / adventure game than heavy combat etc.Some of the animation / effects can look a little bit rough around the edges, but then other moments look quite nice, the colorful settings are nice to look at, and you have some cool gear to use. Controlling the character around the environments felt a lot clunkier than I was originally expecting, at first, but once I realized how many items you are required to look at (and dig through the environment to find -the back of a radio, for example-) I slowed down and wasn't trying to sprint through the areas as much as I was used to in other first person games, still, the character does seem to move a bit spastically at times. The game seems to feature full USB Xbox One controller support, which is nice, and what I was choosing to play with. Keyboard and mouse movement is probably more fluid for the game's approach, but both are servicable.If you're looking for a slower-paced scifi / steampunk setting, with some surreal effects and can overlook some ""budget-y"" looking enemies, this may interest you."

I thought it was going to be like watching the lovechild of Half Life and Bioshock. Then I actually start playing, and I can't even get outside of the stupid cellar I'm holed up in. Now I can sort of relate with the game creator, games like Call of Duty can only be appreciated by small-minded gamers that want their gameplay experiences like they want their rides at Universal Studios, easy and completely laid out for effortless progress. Games like Resident Evil also insult my intelligence with how little effort is put into the puzzle-solving aspects.This, however, is completely on the other side of the spectrum. It's like the game requires you to be Sci-fi McGuyver in order to even get out of the first room. There is a huge monster pounding on the door, and I can only assume the game wants me to make use of a brick, a broken valve, a rope, and a used rat trap to somehow kill this thing when it breaks in, and I'm just not understanding what the game wants from me. Even games like Testament of Sherlock Holmes at least give you some context on what exactly you need to accomplish, without outright telling you how to do it. I mean why not just have the monster break in within like 30 seconds, and you kill it by pulling the cable from a circuit breaker and electricuting the thing to death? It'd be clever, interesting, and not make me dwell so much on a moldy cellar.I really want to see how much potential this game really has. But at this moment, there are only two words I'd use to describe it: Boring and Confusing."
