,Recommended,277590,13170370,"Posted: 30 November, 2014",all,ownosourus,"It’s unusual for Assassin’s Creed story DLC to feature someone who wasn’t the lead character of the main game. Since Assassin’s Creed IV’s story led Edward back to England, though, in order to maintain the Caribbean setting, Freedom Cry tells a tale of Edward’s charismatic quartermaster, Adéwalé, instead. Adéwalé is captain of his own ship now, and he’s a high-ranking member of the Brotherhood as he continues to fight the war against the Templars. Freedom Cry is, quite honestly, the most powerful tale the franchise has told. The Assassin-Templar war is nothing but set dressing that’s promptly shoved into the background to make way for a story about human perseverance, all while cleverly tying the Assassin’s Creed universe into the start of a movement that led to the largest slave revolt in history.The evils of racism and slavery are prevalent throughout and handled far better here than they were in Liberation or their all-too-brief mention in Assassin’s Creed III. Nearly everyone who isn’t a slave sees Adéwalé as an enemy, making even a casual walk through Port-au-Prince a nightmare—and quickly forcing him into combat should he attempt anything suspicious.This makes Freedom Cry surprisingly difficult at times, since almost the entire city is against you. The game subtly makes you aware that you’re having a harder time of things simply because of the color of your skin, and it feels wrong on so many levels. It’s a risky venture for the developers, but I think the message is clear. Besides the stellar storytelling, the game features the same great action for which the series is known, as well as twists on some Black Flag side missions that now revolve around the slavery theme. Instead of recruiting pirates for your crew, you free runaways, liberate slaves from the auction block, or break others out of prison cages.Freedom Cry does have some limitations that put a crimp on its value, though. The exploration and sheer scope of the world seen in the main game are completely gone, leaving you to race through the nine story missions with little incentive to wander from the predetermined path. And, sure, you can still go out to sea, but there’s really no point beyond a couple of mission parameters, since 90 percent of the action takes place within Port-au-Prince.Freedom Cry clearly takes a technical step backward from the accomplishment that was the world of Black Flag. Adéwalé steps brilliantly into the lead role, though. His story, short as it is, helps make up for the smaller world, and it’s enough for Assassin’s Creed fans to check out Freedom Cry if they’re even remotely interested."

,Recommended,277590,14901347,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,ThatDarnOwl,"Freedom Cry is a bit of stand-alone DLC for AC4. You play as Adewale, your ship Quartermaster from AC4 turned Assassin. Who sets out on a quest of his own to liberate slaves in the Carribean.Freedom Cry does a lot to try and be different than AC4. For starters the game is more stealth focused. For much of the game you're liberating slaves from plantations by eliminating their overseers. And the player gets rewarded with new tools, upgrades and weapons for freeing more slaves. However if the player caught they begin to murder the slaves before you can free them. This creates an incentive to play as stealthily as possible and as a result there's significantly less of a combat focus. This was clearly intentional and you tend to only use your blowgun and hidden blades.As a result Freedom Cry feels significantly more like a stealth action game than any of the previous Assassin Creed games. And it's to it's credit. The only real gripes I have with it are the story is a bit lacking compared to AC4 and it doesn't take you that long to complete. It is priced pretty reasonably though and it's a blast to try and complete 100%.I highly recommend Freedom Cry. It complements AC4 nicely, and its more focused stealth gameplay is a welcome change."

It makes some missteps and feels a bit tone deaf at times, but ultimately I think it does an admirable job of incorporating some very serious issues into a game.

Although I wasn't a huge fan of Blackflag, this one did end up with me wanting more at the end.The main character, Adewalé, who also played a part in Blackflag is one of the most bad♥♥♥♥♥characters I've played, not just in Assassin's Creed, but gaming as a whole. The is built like a tank, and won't take any crap from anybody. Proper bad♥♥♥♥♥The story is very DLC style length, and leaves you wanting more after you complete the main mission. There is still plenty of side quests, challenges and hidden treasures to find once you finish it, so for a standalone game, the quantity of gameplay is actually rather impressive.Graphics wise, very impressive. Built on the same engine as Blackflag, you will not find your self disappointed at the visual side of this title.I would highly recommend this game. If you are unsure about purchasing Blackflag, this is probably your best starting point as the gameplay is exactly the same, almost like a long demo. As a stand alone as well, this is a very well put together game that you will certainly get a lot of enjoyment out of.More reviews at -http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/"
,Recommended,277590,23554891,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,Amdod,"Overall:Freedom Cry is a great DLC and I recommend it to those who both enjoy Black Flag and appreciate Adewale. If all you care about is Edward, then maybe stay away from this.What I liked:+ Adewale is a fantastic character to play as. He also seems to be perhaps the most sensible Assassin that you get to play as, having a better understanding of the Creed and how decisions should reflect it...although maybe it's just more noticeable because he's contrasted with Edward, who doesn't really get it for a very long time.+ I actually enjoyed being ""limited"" to the blunderbuss and machete as main weapons. The machete fits perfectly with Ade anyway, but the blunderbuss was a nice touch, even though I preferred the version that was better at range than spread.+ I am very glad that you are able to simply sail around to take down ships and raid plantations as in the main game, so even if the story doesn't appeal to you, you can still have an enjoyable time wreaking havoc, freeing slaves, and upgrading the Experto Crede.What I disliked:- The relative shortness of this DLC (which is understandable, so I don't count it as a negative).- Aside from finishing the storyline fairly quickly, the liberation goals seemed to be set very low. I finished those before the story was over, so now that I've finished the story, there's not much to keep me playing, aside from trying to get 100% synchronization (which isn't too difficult when you don't have to complete all of the constraints in one playthrough).- The fact that several of Ade's objectives, albeit optional, were geared toward being stealthy and/or non-violent, which I don't really feel suits his character. Especially in the setting, as a rather heavily-geared black man should stand out a lot more than someone like Edward would. While that can be used as justification for having Ade have more of a stealth emphasis, I would have liked for the game to have him just embrace that issue and put himself out there, daring people to challenge him.- No sea shanties. At all. Disappointing."

Other than that, it's very similar to AC4, taking most of the features, often simplifing them, since it's on much smaller scale, and unfortunately bearing all the problems AC games have.And the bugs! Oh god, the glitches. I've never seen something like this (haven't played Unity yet) - enemies suddenly spawning from their dead comrades (and instantly raising alarm), friendly AI falling down from ladders and killing themselves, invisible enemies that appear on minimap, the good old ""I just wanted to jump over that wall, not walk on it"", just to name few that were the most memorable, but I kid you not, when this DLC breaks, it breaks hard. I do not remember having such a hard time with AC4 or any previous AC.Still, even without the bugs, the experience is very limited and other than the story, the exploration is so bare bone that it honestly isn't worth it, you won't find anything different from AC4, where pretty much everything is more fleshed out, so I can only recommend this for the story and when on sale, not for it's regular asking price.Decent, but (often) flawed experience."

It borrows the ACIV: Black Flag engine and a character from the game. As with other Assassin's Creed games this one introduces a new character (though Adewale is introduced in ACIV: Black Flag) with a unique Assassins vs. Templars storyline. If you held off on buying ACIV: Black Flag as I did then this game will offer insight into what you are missing. It is the same classic Assassin's Creed formula that makes the series fun with new location, improved visuals and continues the Assassin's fight for a noble cause.I highly recommend it!"

76561198058804201,Recommended,277590,12494491,"Posted: 14 October, 2014",all,BenDover,"Freedom Cry is a short but sweet extra chapter of AC4: Black Flag that brings in just enough new interesting features to make it worth the price. You play as Adewale, Edward Kenway's Ex-First Mate. Most of the game is centered around freeing slaves, and the mid sized area you get to play around with is full of respawning side-missions to do like taking an injured to a safe spot set up by the maroon rebellion or saving a half dozen slaves being auctioned off with force or simplying buying them then letting them go free. Your main area is Port de Prince, a town full of activity, but after an hour of fooling around you will know the town like the back of your hand and done anything there is to do. You get a new ship at the start of the game, and I was happy to see Ubisoft made us a totally new slice of the Carribbean to explore, though another 2 hours and you'll have done literally everything. The bright side is there is a few awesome side missions to play. My favorite is the Plantation missions because of the different techniques to employ in getting the slaves out safely. Start a massive riot and hope to god you and the slaves overpower the overseers or thin the heard steath style until the enemy has only a few men left then swarm them. (It's basically warehouse missions from black flag but once the alarm is triggered you have to act fast because the overseers are outnumbere 4 to 1 by slaves so they start killing them right away after the alarm is trigggered) There are also slave ships which are heavily escorted but carry around 100 slaves but can't be damaged at all before borded (obviously). Adewale is a pretty cool guy but they don't really flesh him out beyond he's has to get back to the brotherhood eventually but he refuses to leave until the rebellion is strong enough to stand without him. The new weapons he gets to use are a nice refreshment though. His main weapons is a machete, and its a brutal weapon that gets the blood flying and seems to always get stuck in the bodies of slavemasters. The second and best new weapon is the blunderbluss, which adds a whole new element of gameplay, because now you can take out a concentrated group of soldiers with one shot. Overall a good game though just barely worth the asking price."

I would have loved to see them make a little more out of that idea like maybe adding Homestead like missions like in AC3 which would have given me more sense of carring about the people i was freeing while running around the open world.

,Recommended,277590,13364443,"Posted: 14 December, 2014",all,Nighthawk,"PresentationFreedom Cry tells the story of Black Flag's Adéwalé, twenty years after the story of Edward Kenway, following Adéwalé in his journey through the West Indies Sea, where he ends up shipwrecked on the coast of Haiti. Making his way into Port-au-Prince he meets up with Bastienne Josèphe, the proprietor of a local brothel and a sympathiser to the Maroons, a faction of freedom fighters made up of liberated slaves. Soon afterwards Adéwalé gets caught up in the events and ends up teaming with the Maroons to free slaves from around the West Indies Sea. As emotional and personal the story is, its length demolishes almost everything the plot wants to uncover, as most missions will be over before you realize it, leaving details aside and focusing only on the main objectives, therefore taking away from the emotional impact the story could've had if we were presented with some background on the slaves and their masters which Adéwalé is supposed to fight blindly. Adéwalé's relationship with Bastienne Josèphe is one of the few things that stands out strong throughout the six hour adventure, as you will find out more about her intentions from one visit to the next one, and by the end of the story form a bond with her that you could only wish would continue for a few more hours.Rating: 6.5GameplayBeing an extension to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, Freedom Cry plays exactly the same, with a few interesting things added for the best, and a lot of amazing features present in the original game removed for the worst. This is still an open world game, so you can use your ship to travel from one location to another just like you did in Black Flag, but not only is the game limited to the West Indies Sea which is a pretty small portion of the Caribbean, but at the same time that portion feels empty in a way that Black Flag never did, even with its enormous map. There are only three main islands where the main plot will take you and maybe five more where you can find a chest or a secret, but for the most part the seas feel empty, and even in those main islands aside from the objective where the mission takes you and the slave liberation missions there is nothing else to do, something that feels weird to begin with for an Assassin's Creed game. On the bright side, the Blunderbuss and Adéwalé's machete are some great new tools to play around with, at least in the main missions since that's the only occasion you'll get to use them properly.Rating: 6GraphicsFreedom Cry was built as an extension to Black Flag, so it uses the same engine and environment, which is only for the best since the original game was a beauty with vast seas, populated lands and unforgiving fleets. In this title, the seas are still there in all their beauty and so are the ships cruising them, but the difference comes when you set sail for land and realize there is nothing else to see there; unlike Black Flag, Freedom Cry has only a few island and even those look similar, as no matter which one you set foot on next, you'll still be greeted by the same slave plantation or empty beach.Rating: 6.5AudioWith such great audio design and quality in Black Flag, it was impossible to screw it up this time, since most of it is reused in here, which isn't much of a problem since all the effects feel authentic in Adéwalé's story as well. There are a couple new tunes created for Freedom Cry exclusively and those find their spot in Adéwalé's story flawlessly, and thanks to some great voice acting performed by Tristan D. Lalla, Adéwalé's character feels even more authentic than it did before in Black Flag throughout Kenway's story.Rating: 9.5ExtrasEven though this can be purchased as a standalone experience, it is obviously just an extension to Black Flag, but even so playing an Assassin's Creed game where you can barely squeeze six hours of playtime if you're taking your time with the story, completing all the slave liberation missions and looking around for the few islands that hide a chest feels weird since Assassin's Creed was always about exploration and the things you can do on the side, things that are almost non-existent in Freedom Cry.Rating: 5.5VerdictFreedom Cry wanted to tell a more personal story than the original Black Flag, but unfortunately the limited length of the story, as well as the empty environment in which it takes place makes it fall flawed as important and emotional events will be over before realizing it and for most parts without any explanation or background on Adéwalé's intentions.Rating Overall: 6.8Check out the full review and a lot more about Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry athttp://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=310"

On the one hand, playing as Adewale is amazing and the setting is interesting. On the other hand, the story is far too short and the characters (besides Adewale) aren't very well made. The introduction of new features to accomodate for the fact that you are playing as an African Assassin in a time period of great racial turmoil are very well crafted and subtle. The soundtrack is incredible and the return to Black Flag's ship combat is a welcome one. However, this is a very poor port to PC as no matter how low you set the visuals, the framerate stays at an inconsistent 19 FPS, usually dropping lower and only rising during cutscenes where nothing much is happening. It is very jarring but it is only a problem on PC. I would recommend buying it if you wish to buy this on console but not here"

It's still a very very short story but there are touching storyline, characters you care,  and the game just feels like you are actually in the slavery era, and the amazing music, side quests and atmosphere strengthens this situation. Adewale is a strong main character. We saw him in Black Flag, but we never knew the characters backstory, or the connection to Assassin's. The map is also really big , especially in a short game like this, there are lots of secrets to discover, treasures to find. And awesome side activities like diving or harpooning big sea animals still here, and still fun as hell. Liberating slaves are fun. But gets boring and repititve really fast. The great mix of stealth and blunt combat is great, machete is also very satisfactory weapon. Ship and Adewale upgrades gradually increases the gametime for completionists like me. Its overall great fun for all Assassins Creed lovers.Pros:+ Great graphics and atmosphere+ Lots of side activities and unlockables+ Big map, lots of places to travel+ Great and fitting soundtracks+ Very good story+ Great combat, personally the best in the series+ Lots of weapons, side weapons and fun itemsCons:- Abysmally short story- No alternate outfits- Lots of bugsGraphics:8Presentation:8Sound/Music:8Gameplay:8Overall:8.0"

However, when I finished it a day or so later, I felt a little disappointed.This game overall feels more like a couple of long DLC missions in the main game than a stand alone game. It's entertaining enough if you liked Black Flag, because this is basically the same, but on a much smaller, less interesting scale. It feels like you're just playing as a reskinned Edward, as the idle animations are the exact same. You can hunt certain animals, but there's no purpose, because you can't craft or make more outfits. Like in Black Flag, you can plunder other ships, but the rewards are so badly scaled to the prices of the few upgrades, that you're basically decked out after you've pulverized four ships. Freedom Cry feels like someone cut a tiny square out of the bayeux tapestry. It's aesthetically pleasing in itself, but it's lacking a whole hell of a lot of context.I personally don't feel like Freedom Cry's got enough content or weight to be its own game. I played it, I completed it, it was okay while it lasted, but in a critical light, this really isn't that big of a deal. I would't recommend buying this unless it's on sale."

I enjoyed Adewale’s “path of freedom” so much that I think this truly deserved more attention as a game and not only a short DLC, since they could have done a lot with this story.The gameplay is the same as Black Flag with a few new weapons and tools, but it’s still enjoyable. Adewale has his own ship, which you can use to free slave from other ships. Currency is instead replaced with the amount of slaves you free from plantations, prisons or punishments.It really was a good change from the main game to play as Adewale, I really recommend anyone to buy this DLC but wait for sales, it contains a few short but enjoyable hours of story and good changes in gameplay."

A few times in Freedom Cry, I found myself going out of my way to take out some of these jerks who were particularly nasty to the slaves, and I found myself feeling Ade's anger along with it.If you were a little miffed that Black Flag basically ignored all the slavery going on around Edward, this one will take a step or two to remedy that."

Black Flag was great, of course, but the story was a little empty and I feel a got more story out of 8 hours in Freedom Cry than I did with 80 hours in Black Flag.I recommend checking out the undiscovered map locations and islands before getting too far in the story, there are other machetes and guns to find and it's kinda pointless finding them after you complete the story."

If you do not have it I suggest you buy it at a sale because the main game will be cheaper than the dlc since the price is only slightly higher but the overall content is more aswell.I own Assassins Creed on XBox 360 and the game simply is breathtaking with the easy to learn gameplay, the open world features and the good and atmospheric music. The story however was a little short and Freedom Cry as a dlc is of course even shorter. Most players suggest an average gametime of only 4-6 hours. However it took me about 20 Hours to discover all the places unlock everything and tried the minigames like fishing. (They are the same as in Black Flag though)Adewale has his own combat style and uses a machete. Like Kennway he can use firearms, ropedarts, poisoned darts etc. The overall gameplay is the same as in Black Flag but the story is set 20 years later. (I wont say much about it since i dont want to spoiler and it depends on your taste if you will enjoy it or not).The map is not very big, i am guessing less than 25% of Black Flags overall map but the locations have their own appearance and are detailed.I did not encounter any notable bugs but I was a bit dissappointed that Adewales ship is a repainted Jackdaw.The ship however cannot be upgraded as much as the Jackdaw.A new element in the game is as already mentioned Adewales own combat style and the ability to free slaves either by boarding slave ships or by killing the overseers at the plantations. Some of the overseers have become very hostile and will attack you instantly. If you are spotted on the plantations, the overseers are going to kill your maroonfellows so you should really take care.The plantations sooner or later always get new owners so you can replay this part. The game also can be continued after the story has come to an end just like in Black Flag.If you enjoyed Black Flag and want some more story related content or discover some more West Indies locations I really recommend this but dont expect a lot of new content. Also keep an eye out for a decent sale, I suggest maybe 3-5 dollars is a good price."

The game is set many years later from the events in Black Flag.Adewale's story is about the rise of people enslaved for many generations. It basically embodies the very foundation of what the Assassins stand for: Freedom and love for life.The graphics and mechanics is identical to Black Flag but there are new weapons and tools that are unique to the game.In conclusion, I give the game 4/5 in my scale.

Playing as Edwards mate Adewale in a smaller section of the Carribean, essentially starting a slave rebellion, the short yet intense gameplay brings a lot of similar action to Black Flack with a great story line to boot.The game is fairly short with the story line and there is a few things that can help occupy your time that are similar to Black Flag, with diving spots and whale hunting. Ship battles never get old, although you can fairly quickly advance your ship, making all but battles with a few of the toughest ships a challenge.As a fan of the series (not as big a fan of Unity) I would highly reccomend purchasing this cheap yet exciting 5 or so hour long game you will get your monies worth and if its on sale then its a steal.Pros:- Great story line- Smooth combat system- Return of the 'Adewale'- Ship battles!!!Cons:- Mission stories are quick to finish- Too easy to level up 'Experto Creed' (ship)- Not enough equiptment to obtain- No legendary ship to defeatOverall this is a great edition to the Black Flag saga to bring back the memories of maybe the best game of the series.

76561197960550055,Not Recommended,277590,13202999,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,Dnaldaeh,"TLDR: A sloppy and underwhelming DLC product that does a disservice to both it's subject matter and original game. Buy the base game, Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag, or Assassins Creed: Rogue.The narrative feels rushed and unfocused, beginning and ending rather abruptly. It starts with your classic AC MacGuffin, then promptly forgets about it; Then touches on themes of slavery but begins to quickly move them to the backround, instead focusing too much of it's narrative on a cartographer mapping the Caribbean that happens to be in Port au Prince (The primary setting of this DLC.) This leads to far too many tail/eavesdrop missions, moreso some of the worst, most frustrating examples in any of the AC games to date. It relies too much on tightly scripted sequences that limit your mobility and/or abilities and mistakes tedium for engagement too often. The main story missions can be completed in under 4 hours.The freeing of slaves is relegated mostly to narrative-devoid side activities, tied to unlocking upgraded weapons and other optional items, cheapening the poignancy to the point of repetitively farming a statistic. The repetition is not helped by the rapid respawn of prisoners; I could return to the same spot within two minutes to find new caged prisoners, new guards taking the exact same routes, the corpses of their predecessors still laying about.The game is really at it's best when you are raiding plantations. You free the slaves of the plantation by killing guards. It's just nice having that chance to take it on in your own way, with your full set of skills and the space to use them instead of limiting them like a majority of the main missions. It's always the same objective, Kill 20 guards, and it feels like a wasted opportunity; It could have used more variety to keep it fresh, and without narrative it only serves as a distraction from the underwhelming storyline.Sailing feels like an afterthought, with a very small map and only a handful of locations to explore, with many of those being little more than beaches with a chest or two on them. After all the sea shanties of AC4, it is very noticeable that Adewale's ship crew is generally silent; it would have been nice if there were a couple of new, theme appropriate songs for them to sing, or just a few of the old ones. There are no treasure maps to find, no forts to destroy, no side assassinations to undertake. Hunting and whaling are pointless as there's nothing to craft. I didn't even notice there were ship upgrades until the second playthrough, the ship's upgraded enough out of the gate to deal with the few ship-to-ship fights. It's also painfully obvious you're always sailing the Jackdaw, the recycled ship model from the main game (AC4 Black Flag.) The ship you're sailing and sinks out of the gate is identical, and then the next one you steal is EXACTLY THE SAME, right down to the decorations, even the three skulls hanging over captains quarters entrance.The new items border on impractical: The blunderbuss is a shrapnel-spread shotgun that's just as likely to kill the slaves you're trying to free or your crew as you board other ships; The noise-making firecrackers can only be dropped right in front of you and the noise doesn't seem to have much distance. The Machete is a sword, just like any other AC game, albeit with some pretty sweet, brutal animations. The animations are sort of aesthetically flawed since they go on a little long in combos and tend to get cut off as you parry other enemies in groups.As with other recent series entries, this one suffers from an inconsistent frame rate and animation/scripting bugs that mar it's presentation. I watched a hunter's ship sail up the side of an islands rocky peak and into the air before flipping back into the water. I was caught during tailing/eavesdrop missions because sometimes the target would get caught on something/someone and would do a quick spin on the spot, seeing in all directions at once for a second. Sometimes freeing slaves would spawn guards out of thin air (Maybe not a bug but it happened a lot, it was tedious and annoying.) The frame rate plummets noticeably at seemingly random intervals and occasionally assets will materialise in front of Adewale as he runs through the streets.Adewale is a potentially interesting and charismatic character and I was hoping to get to know him a bit better, as well as explore a very dark aspect of colonialism that was largely glossed over in AC 3 and 4. Freedom Cry does little to add much dimension to it's protagonist, seems uncomfortable confronting the issues of it's own subject matter, and it's disappointing it failed to approach it with compelling narrative or engaging gameplay."

It's rather short of course, but the developers have a nice creativity meets willingness to pay margin here in my opinion.  If you don't own AC4 get this now, if you do own it maybe pass because it's more of the same but slighty less of it.. YES it's another AC BUT the pirate theme which is briefly touched upon in 3 is SOOO much cooler here.Tropical Island paradises ripped right out of history you most likely never knew about.  The game even includes the option to learn all about the people and events in their thesarus thing built into the menu.The graphics are breathtaking and the story telling is better than ever.  I had to try out AC4 after playing this and my mind was blown.  For the money try this and see if you like the new theme.  It's the new direction they are going and it's interesting.

Your given the task of freeing and recruiting slaves, but sadly never given the chance to manage them. All you get rewarded with is your hideout slightly changing and a few upgrades to your weapons.The game really shines with the navy combat, over the few hours you will go from what feels like a small fishing boat to a battleship, with small whaling mini games and a few small beaches to explore.I think its a fantastic buy for those who want a short game and dont need to invest too much time into a complex game."
,Recommended,277590,9591470,"Posted: 22 March, 2014",all,Kendross,"If you've beaten Black Flag and want more, this will mostly do the trick. Set 13-15 years after AC4, Adewale has risen from Kenway's right-hand man, to a full-fledged Assassin/Captain. After an intense opening scene, he finds himself washed ashore and caught in the midst of a civil struggle. It's time to free some slaves, hence the subtitle of the game. There are many different scenarios in which you can free said slaves. Some will be locked in a cage, and you have to kill the guard carrying the key. Others will be working on plantations, in which you must eliminate a certain number of guards to free them.Freeing as many slaves as possible actually grants you bonuses, and sometimes even needed to advance the story. The bonuses range from free restocks on ammunition, to even new weapons. With slaves pratically all over the place ready to be liberated, achieving these bonuses doesn't exactly take a long time.As you'd expect, Freedom Cry does have naval content, including it's own (DLC sized) open-world map. Attacking and boarding other ships for goods is still relevant, but nowhere near as much as Black Flag. A lot of the locations to discover are unfortunately pretty dull. There's several islands which consist of only a small beach and one chest to open, then you're done there. I'm not sure why Ubisoft even bothered, as it's probably the most disappointing part of FC. Still, just sailing the open sea remains a joy to behold. No sea shanties (pirate songs), however.Just like Black Flag, Freedom Cry is GORGEOUS. It's a shame that sometimes some information is still present on your screen, even with the HUD options turned ""all off"", because I love taking clean screenshots. Even so, it's such a beautiful game to behold, especially the water. You'll catch yourself just staring at the visuals and remember there's a game to play.I was surprised with the length of FC. I expected to be done in about 3-4 hours, but my save file clocks-in at almost 9 hours. That's including all side-content. Not a bad chunk of time for a piece of something that's stand-alone DLC. So, if you want a demo of Black Flag, this is the closest you'll get of that experience. Granted, Black Flag is obviously the fuller experience, but I do recommend buying this if you're wondering what it's like.I am pleased with the time I spent with Freedom Cry. A lovely slice of Assassin/Pirate content to keep one's interest for a decent amount of time."

You were formerly a slave, working on a plantation until pirates raided it. Although Adewale was previously the legendary Edward Kenway's Quartermaster, Adewale found that he wanted to save slaves, rather than be a pirate. In this game, you follow him across the Carribean, as he liberates slaves and recruits maroons.The quality of the game is FANTASTIC! A new feature for the AC series (which was also introduced in Black Flag) is sailing across open world areas, rather than only whilst on missions (in Assassin's Creed 3). Sailing is incredibly simple as all you do is press the forward key, maybe move left and right, etc. A feature of the game (which personally had me excited) was the ability to board other enemy vessels. Boarding too is simple. All you do is press the S key (or whatever you have set stop to) whilst alongside another almost destroyed vessel, and it will automatically cause your ship to dock alongside. Your crew too will react, throwing Grappling hooks to draw your vessels nearer to each other.Your crew will then board the vessel and so on. The Graphics in the game are of a high standard, as Nvidia is involved (seeing as modern Nvidia games are awesome), so you will need at least a 2.6 GHZ processor and a decent graphics card to withstand the urges ingame. The fighting style in AC4 is incredibly similar to that of AC3, with only a couple of differences. For £11 I am incredibly happy, aand will be getting Black Flag soon."

You begin on the seas in your ship on a mission to intercept a Templar package.  After a brief naval battle, you sail through a storm and end up in Port au Prince in Sam Domingue. From there onwards, you do all kinds of Assassin-y stuff on your own personal mission (of sorts) to free slaves and uncover a plot by Pierre, marquis de Fayet to...do stuff.Freedom Cry doesn't really offer anything new that Black Flag didn't. In fact, a bit less, which makes sense when you consider the fact that it was originally just a DLC pack before it became a standalone game. Oh and they weren't kidding when they said standalone. If you've never played a single Assassin's Creed title before this one, you won't have any problems grasping what's going on, as it really doesn't have anything to do with the main plot of the series. But, I digress.You get two main weapons: a machete and a blunderbuss (as well as your hidden blades, but hidden blades in Assassin's Creed are a given at this point). Both can be upgraded with different versions, but still, the lack of variety in weapon types is a little disappointing. But, again, it's DLC. Most of the side weapons from Black Flag are present, including the blow gun and the rope dart.The naval combat is as excellent as ever, though if you haven't played Black Flag it may take a little while to grasp as there's no real tutorial for it here. Your ship, the Experto Crede, is slightly upgradeable with a few gun and mortar upgrades, as well as a hull upgrade. You can also (kind of) customize its appearance with some nifty anti-slavery decorations.Very basically, it's a slightly stripped-down Black Flag with a different main character and a much shorter storyline. Very fun to play, frustrating as hell at times, and (SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT THINLY VEILED IN RIDDLE) it'll leave you feeling a bit like Brad Pitt's character at the end of Seven. Remember Seven? Man, that was a good movie. What? Oh, right. The review. Um, yeah. Play this game. And stuff."

But this is the first I have played any of the Assassin games, there is no tutorial mode to teach you how to fight move, climb drive a boat, shoot a cannon, clime a tree jump.  Nothing, you just die and reload and try again.  I am guessing you had to start from a previous/older version of the Assassin series to figure this out.  Kind of frustrating.  Let me know if one of the other games have a build up/training mode to help you learn the ins and outs of moving and combat?  Thanks.I went out and bought a gamepad to see if that would help play this game.  Nope.  this game sucks on PC, not really configurable.  I can't seem to custumize it any usful way.  I think there is too much automatic assumptions made based on my movement and I can't control anything very well.  The start of the game on the ship, I seem to be able to do that with Keyboard and Mouse better then with the gamepad, but fighting and basic movement is completely skewed and there is no tutorial on playing.  There is a few tips that pop up durring a battle, I trying not to die, fighing clicking random buttons and trying to read directions at the same time...  WTF!!  Big flaw in the design there.Gamepad X, Y configs are screwed too, I can't reverse one with out reversing both, so it modifies left and right if I modify up and down.  ??   ARG!

Didn't take me long to beat it, and was one of the worst video game endings I've ever seen as far as development, closure, and appeal.For $3.75, it's about what you pay for. Anything more is a waste. I'm going to pretend Assassin's Creed Revelations was the last AC game, because these last few games have sucked pretty bad. AC:4 didn't even feel like an AC game. It felt like ""AC Mechanics as a Pirate!,"" even though pirates are the main people Ubi likes to appeal to with Uplay using more CPU and RAM reasources than Origin and Steam combined."

I played for 30 mins and never went back. So, I thought maybe I was being unfair. Im not. And the only reason why this has good reviews is because the cinematics are fine and there is a loyal fanbase that only upvotes things because it is AC. Thats it. I've had a long and detailed discsussion about this with a few of them. In the end - after a long long time of denying their bias - they finally just said ""well I like AC so I can look past the fact its almost totally flawed"".

Your main goal in this game is to free other (black) slaves.Like 70% of the gameplay is to free slaves, and a bit is the old piracy from AC:IV where you steer another pirate ship just like in AC:IV but with Adewale as the captain onboard. It's some real fun if you didn't have enough of AC:IV. And myself, I miss AC:IV after finishing it because I feel that something more besides the campaign mode would be much appreciated. Like all non-standalone AC's, there's a bad multiplayer mode and I feel that this game fill up my needs for the piracy-part sequel I've always wanted..

Unfortunately, I found the story uninteresting and sometimes confusing. For example, Bastienne, the owner of the local brothel, will like Adewale at the beginning of one scene, then seem to hate him at the end for something he said, and then seem like she's in love with him the next time they meet without explanation or justification.Then, there are the missions. Most of the missions are about as good as a middle of the road mission from Black Flag. The worst missions, however, are either boring or frustratingly difficult because of annoying placement of enemies or weird technicalities (Why do I have to swap a ship manifest WHILE two enemies are looking at it? Why can't I swap it while it's sitting unguarded? You know, as logic would dictate?)If you enjoyed Black Flag, and you're wondering if you should play this game, just pass.

I get the fact that Adewale is helping the maroons and everything, but what else?! I was hoping for more insight to his life, because when I played Black Flag, I felt his story had to be heard. Slightly repetitive gameplay in terms of slave rescue missions. It took me approximately 10 hours to complete the game with 100% sync. Plus, I think we could manage knowing the other characters a bit more. But good effort by Ubisoft."

About f***ing time.It took me forever to get this game to work on my old laptop, but now I've finally loaded this thing up!.... On a separate laptop. With a much better graphics card. And processor.I could rant like I did before about Ubisoft being far too prissy about their graphics, but I'm sure anyone who did play this game actually read the system requirements. But I suppose I could get mad that Ubisoft also requires you install UPlay, their far inferior attempt to compete against Steam and Origin.Well, the store itself is pretty sh***y, but the Ubi30 free game deal is pretty sweet. And once you get UPlay actually up, the game starts and runs just fine... although it will remind you how fast the game is running in the top left corner as a default option. Just so the extreme PC Master Race freaks can reminds themselves what a great decision they made to depart from being console owners.The game looks good. The game plays good. But that's really because it's just Assassin's Creed IV condensed. Sure, it says ""Standalone Game"" in the pictures of it, but this is really just an inflated DLC pack. But still a better one than today's standard of DLCs.You play as Adewale as he fights against racism and slavery in the West Indies. You're given a small map to work with as Adewale or in his own pirate ship and crew. And that's all good and dandy, but how does the story fare?It's alright. Yeah, it's about racial discrimination, which is never the most subtle topic but it's still handled well in this story. The overall point isn't shoved in your face like some other racial stories. What I can't stand in this game was the requirement to gather slaves or perform menial tasks before unlocking the next story mission, which seems pretty foolish to me. It takes the focus away from the story and into the player just crossing off items on a checklist.I'm also not a fan of how in this game, like several later Assassin's Creed games can get with reserved acting. Even in the highest resolution and graphical settings, the characters in this story are just bland and not very expressive, so it makes cutscenes less engaging as a player.If you love Black Flag to death and want a little more story and some more gameplay mechanics, then this is definitely for you. But I'm still sticking with not recommending it for anyone who wants to play just this and nothing else. Black Flag felt more like a well-made meal, and Freedom Cry feels more like a desert that's filled with just some poorly-cooked vegetables. I'm giving Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry a 5/10"

There are times when you can either play stealthily or mow anyone down (although with a penalty) so there is some variation in play styles.To those who also enjoy the ship portion of AC 3 and AC4, this game comes with a significant portion of that but it's not really that important.

A few hours more of sidestory of Adéwalé liberating his black brothers from slavery. A few just eavesdropping or following missions, where you could easily get punished when leaving stealth. Don't like the way the game pushes you to be stealth, you just have no option.Felt more free when playing older AC's beforce AC3 came. I love stealth, but don't like the way FreedomCry literally pushes you into the corner during story missions and punishes you by failing mission without any possibility to run away or fight etc.Game itself has same assets, animations and whole core are from Black Flag, so beside of main story you can again sail the beatiful sea on a few isles and liberat slaves from slaveships or from plantations, which are infinitely occupied againg some time after you liberate them. Hunting/fishing and revealing a few unknown locations is here too.Not bad, but not so good, expected more or a bit richier story of Adwéwalé. Nice setting and characters, i could imagine whole game based on slavery theme.Anyway i loved different approach when liberating plantations during day and during night. Most of time there is a static daytime (i loved dynamic daytime in AC2/Bhd/Rvs), but you can easily change daytime between day and night ... same was as in FarCry2 ;).If you're AC fan as probably i am ;) you can give it try, but don't expect too much."

,Recommended,277590,20410275,"Posted: 8 January, 2016",all,PandaFraHelvete,"Assassin’s Creed Freedom Cry is a standalone game that follows the same pattern as its predecessor did, Black Flag, but this time the main protagonist was a secondary character on the previous title, Adéwalé, being an assassin and many years after the ending of Black Flag, we found ourselves stranded on Port-au-Prince, with no ship and no crew, we must struggle to find our way out of there, though now his motivations are focused on the liberation of slaves that suffer greatly in the new world.Story1735 is the year and Adéwalé is now an Assassin, embracing the creed’s beliefs and struggle, he finds himself stranded in Port-au-Prince. But after many years of piracy he decides now is time to put the Creed’s name to a good use and begin a new fight and the liberation of slaves, helping the resistance called The Maroons for independence and dignity, Adéwalé and his skills turn out to be of great help to the resistance. Before leaving, he helps building a new hope for the slaves.GameplayThe game mechanics don’t change that much compared to Black Flag, though some new load-out for a new assassin is required as per usual, for Adéwalé we have now some powerful weapons like the blunderbuss and machete, while the blunderbuss is a one-shot gun, its power doesn’t have match, it is a slow weapon but once you have multiple enemies facing you, one blow will kill most of them, if not all, making it a death fest every time you pull the trigger.On the other hand, the machete is kind of new to us, we have mostly used swords before, but Adéwalé with machete in hand makes him, perhaps the most brutal and relentless fighter of all assassins in my opinion, he is just a beast and the killing animations are proof of it, a good tool for a great and skilled killer.Many other things remain the same, there are not many differences, smoke bombs, the rope dart and the poison and sleep darts are kept, a small addition were the firecrackers that will help you with guards at some point in the story, besides that, the game remains almost the same.Naval combat is the same as well, and the map is very limited, but makes sense, this game is not that long and the exploration is restricted to some few islands and locations.The interesting part of this game is and will always be slavery, our struggle is focused on the liberation of slaves, there are plantations in different parts of the map which can be raided and liberated, this will help you unlock new items and missions and also bring new people to the resistance, also during naval combat you will encounter enemy ships carrying many ore slaves, this ships cannot be attacked but they will always have protection. In the main city, small groups of slaves can be liberated as well, either from punishment, caging or auctions.GraphicsThere are not many things to say on this point, it looks the same as Black Flag, equally beautiful, so if you want to know more, read my Black Flag review.Sound and musicThe sound remains identical to Black Flag as well, voices are full of passion and the accents are great. On the music side, we have some new sounds and tunes that are related to the culture, some sort of African like melodies with chants in French, this makes the atmosphere of the game and the slavery theme. Awesome.The badWhile ACFC remains bug free and found no issues in-game, I really believe that some few things could have been different to my taste. For example, after liberating plantations, a good idea would have been to destroy at some point certain plantations, setting them on fire or destroying the crops, making them a waste of time to rebuild, this came to my mind after seeing how many times x plantation had a new owner after a few minutes, making it an endless loop of liberation, makes sense, yes, slaves were a profitable business back then and at some point someone will bring more and more, but stopping them once and for all would have been more satisfying in the end.Final wordsACFC is a good game on its own, it doesn’t have the same spectrum as previous titles and the character is not developed in depth, but that is not a problem when it comes to action and the brutal way we kill enemies. There are some scenes that truly show how slavery was back in that time, it was terrible and at some point you can see how the life of the slaves was regarded as disposable by the masters and the empires. There are heartbreaking moments to say the least.All in all, it was an enjoyable game, with more pros than cons, new tools and weapons and a very satisfying gameplay, Adéwalé is a killing machine!"

I'm not a fan of the ships, but I know most liked Black Flag so this is a good extension of that. I like the land-stealth elements most. Make sure you meet the specs. 7.5/10 for price."

I tried the standalone game.Expect the same as AC Black Flag, but playing as Adewalé.I have to say that your global progress (%) only concerns main storyline. Doesn't matter if you explore the islands or take the collectibles, that won't affect your global game progress (the % you have).Anyway, if you like AC Black Flag, you'll like this.I give it a 7.5/10"

,Recommended,277590,35488971,Posted: 5 October,all,MightyMike,I actually enjoyed playing this really short game. For the content this game gives is the price not worth it but an AC fan like me would still like this game.
