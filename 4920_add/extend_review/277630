Long single player campaign. I think it take you more than 30 hours to compelete it3. More accesible to casual gamers than Panzer CorpsCons:1. No multiplayer2. No additional single player scenarios3. No adjustable difficulty level. Actually there are three campaigns there (Germans, USSR,Allies), that ascend from easy to hardIf you like this genre, there are few new game right noe in the market, so if you fully exhaust Panzer Cops and all of it's DLC, You can give this game a chance. Buying in sales recommended."
,Not Recommended,277630,12784126,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,DC,"Do not buy this game if you are familliar with Panzer General series. This game is not nearly is interesting as Panzer General. It lacks many features, for example you cannot postpone action of the unit within the same turn. Like moving infantry first, then moving artillery, firing artillery, then attacking with infantry you moved first place. And feature of Panzer General 3D called ""suppression"" is priceless.Again I've thrown my money away when I bought BitComposer title. Never again."

I have a ton of xp playing the panzer general series, commando and hearts of iron so I know this kind of game and you are getting a decent game here.There are some cool things in this game like the commando units and the leadership attachments.  The visuals are great and there are no cut scenes that slow the game down or distract you.  And for what your paying for your are getting a deal I think.There's only a few minor issues I have and that's things like playing the Afrika Korps and seeing Panther tanks and me going huh as they were never in Africa the tanks that is.  The campaigns don't seem long enough or involved enough.  And the army you build seems sketchy as im not sure I keep my units from one mission to another.But the rewards system is great and love what we see there and secondary objectives is cool in the fact that many games would have given no incentive to capping those obj's.  But this game there are cool perk's.  But wont ruin for you.Id love to see more missions and make the fate of your world for your faction seem to be bigger and I could see story added to these games one day as I like what has been done with this game so far but i always have so many ideas how these games can be pushed.This game is crisp and clear and is not too difficult and not too simple and if you are looking for a relaxing war game this is a good one to try.Thanks to the developers."
76561198129055233,Recommended,277630,12748142,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,The Great Urban,"Good game,but too simply in comparison with Panzer corps or the old Dos based Panzer General series. The different types of the units arent useful because the only different because of them is that the modern ones better in all way (except price)the older one. So u will always use the moderner types of the units. The missions have also not really challenge cos there are only a few missions in all campaign and the missions are linear,there is not difference if u win or lose (if lose game is over)-except 1-2 bonus mission-but in comparison with Panzer General series (from the 1990's) there is much fewer missions and units. It would be better to create a game with only one side of the fighting forces (allies/axis/russia/japs) but with more interesting and bigger numbered  campaigns and more different units. I also didn't like the game cartoon-style graphics and  I missed some  WWII picture /movie in game to increase its entertaining value for a WWII fan.In all,the game is not bad,the main feature of it is the generals,but after you ended a campaign you wont want start the next,cos it became soon boring."

This game is easily the best turn based strategy war game I have ever played in my life. For only 11 bucks I have already had over 23 hours of enjoyment and probably have about another 40-50 to go before i ace all the missions in the 3 campaigns. The game looks and sounds great, it rewards strategic thinking and tactical planning, it is fun, the logic of the game is based on real life so it makes sense (units run out of fuel, ammo, tanks are at a disadvantage fighting in mountains/cites etc.a bit more details if you care:Easy to pick up, lots of depth and a tutorial that actually teaches you things! shocking i know right...seriously though, play the tutorial and the ? at the top right of the screen if you click it will break down to 4 screens explaining all of the stats for your units. Weather reports will let you know the forecast so you can plan for your or the enemies airforce.This game forces you to use combined arms tactics if you want to excel. You must also spend your resources wisely...at the same time though, while losing a core unit can be painful, it does not ruin the experience and actually makes you plan a bit so you don't needlessly squander your units.Also, FYI the units already on the map that are yours when you first start, are non core units (i.e. they don't persist after the mission) so if you know you are going to have to lose a unit...risk them..don't risk your core units, and whenever possible upgrade them too to make them more effective.Anyway, can't say enough good about this game. IF you like turn based strategy, pick this up, you won't be dissapointed.For cons there are a few minor niggles...like when switching the view bt air/land units sometimes the cursor will show the air unit but when you click on the tab to move it to, it switches back to the land unit under it (solution is to just click HQ tab and then back out of it, this will reset the tab and you can start again. Not a huge issue but does crop up occassionally.occasionally, some of the optional secondary objectives don't really give you enough info at first and you kind of have to figure out what you need to do or the best way to accomplish the mission (a few times i restarted a map because of making a crucial error...at the same time however, towards the middle of the campaign i finally had a pretty diverse group of core units that could handle whatever came their way if i read the map and mission brifings as well as reports to guess the enemy intentions and deploy and utilize my units effectively. Again, not a major issue since not everyone likes to get perfect mission ratings on every map..but i do so if i screwed up i started over and then applied my lessons well.-only other minor issue is that there are only 5 save slots and the music could be a bit better (its pretty decent but not amazing). The sound of your units, graphics and weather effects definitely overshadow that minor issue and make you forget and lose yourself in the game.Bottom line...i have had several concussions and thinking a lot gives me headaches...despite this i sometimes play this game and lose track of time and quit only when my head feels like it shrunk and is two sizes too small...lol its that good!Buy this game already! it is amazing!"

You WISH chess could be this fun.  I play this game, or whatever remake they have of it, every 5 years becuase it's the only game that still bends my mind. Please message me if you know something as smart as this.Here's some things I've learned both about this game and the real WWII:Pioneer infantry is more useful because they can cross rivers faster.Germany had design issues.  Like old VWs, sometimes older models worked better than the new stuff.You can win the entire war without a single anti-tank unit.  Just recruit more tanks and just embrace violent and glorious tank-on-tank battles.Paratroopers are glorified suicide squads.You're not really suiciding units if you're using them to win as fast as possible.  War sucks bro.Roads are death.  Forests are life.Taking risks with your aerial units never works.  They will get blown out of the sky the moment you lax on the paranoia.The French lost that war on purpose.  Nobody can be that bad.""Stay together, or die.""  You don't need to take EVERY French village... even if you have fantasies of getting free food for liberating them.This war was so fun, it's sad when it's all over."

,Recommended,277630,29696828,Posted: 4 February,all,[CWB]theDaftDev,"Entertaining and well polished game.If you're new to this kind of game it's probably your best bet on the steam store. If you're used to more advanced strategy games like Panzer General and its clones, you will feel like the game lacks many features and your freedom of movement is limited. The AI is very passive and most missions are repetitive in the sense that you are always on the attacker side and never get to experience an offensive AI. Sadly the game doesn't feature a multiplayer mode which kinda sucks.The graphics look really nice in general but the UI was not very well thought.Other than that, it's a nice small game to pass the time."
76561198202613939,Recommended,277630,32190451,Posted: 4 June,all,Akhazir,"I purchased this game on sale for $2.49, expecting Panzer General-lite. That is about what this game is. All-in-all, it was fun, and had a number of difficult missions that made it easily worth what I paid and more.The one major flaw with the game is that it auto-upgrades the core army between missions. Maybe I wanted those experienced pioneers for their mobility and bunker busting? Also, by the time you have the three expensive generals, there is nothing to use your Fame on, especially as unit costs (recruit, supply, reinforcement) are so low. Having more unit upgrades or the ability to recruit a few auxiliary units per mission would have been nice, although the latter would have significantly reduced the challenge.At any rate, it took me 101 hours to get 3 stars + secondary objectives on every mission of each of the campaigns. I am quite glad I purchased this."

As a matter of fact, I found out about this game just a week before it was released when I randomly had a craving for Panzer Tactics.Pros -WW2 setting for those who like itGood range of unitsChallenging mapsCons -Some units feel badly restrained into roles, such as fighter-bombers being unable to engage enemy aircraftUI is made for touch device, you have to CONFIRM click every decision you make, which gets old fastDoesn't seem to be much dev support looking to patch it into a stronger PC portIf you wanted to play this in a serious way I'd say buy the touch-device version.Similar games I'd recommend -For your real-time WW2 fixings ""RUSE"" is a great game with a different feel to most RTS gamesFor an indie turn-based war game look at Battle Worlds Chronos"

There isn't a whole lot of replay value, since once you beat a campaign level you know how you should approach it in later attempts and since the AI is fairly consistent in its playstyle. Nice if you just want a strategy challenge for an hour or so."

Takes me back to the early 90s where Panzer general was my game of choice. Some of these maps and missions due remind me and look alot like the old Panzer General. I think this game is the best remake to be close to Panzer General.If you like Panzer general you going to love this game.Pro:Great MapsNice unitsGreat missions that make you think and earn your way.Game allows you to keep 20 units ( Core units ) and grow them throughout the game.Very long game, you can play Germany, Allies, Russia.Cons:It was made for touch screen, so confirming every move gets old.Fighter Bombers can't be a fighter, just a bomber.I would have loved to see the action screen ( Battle Movie) when in a battle. Some turn this off, but wish this was moved over from the old DS version.Wish the units on the map had a little more detail in color. Some of the bombers are just one color.They look like plastic one color toys on the board."
