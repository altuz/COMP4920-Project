( Pretty good price too )- Graphs aged pretty well.- Soundtracks are amazing.- Gameplay might look a little hard for today and can be awkward sometimes but still not bad.- Story 8/10 (Not perfect but pretty interesting)So overall if you are into some old classic RPG you should try it."
,Recommended,277650,24925781,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,Felipepepe,"Kult: Heretic Kingdoms (aka Heretic Kingdoms: The Inquisition in the US) began with 3D People developing an isometric Action-RPG. To stand out among the many “Diablo-clones” of the early 2000’s, they partnered with International Hobo, a game writing & design consultancy company.This little back-story seems key to understanding why Kult feels like two different games inside one.Clearly influenced by the works of Michael Moorcock, the game tells of a world were an ancient hero killed God. His blade became infused with god-like powers, and later one of his descendants used it to conquer the land, imposing a brutal theocracy. He was eventually defeated, and to stop another theocrat from rising the sword was hidden and an inquisition was formed, seeking to destroy all forms of religions that might grow to oppress humanity.You play as Alita, an apprentice to the High Inquisitor – but also a descendant of the ancient hero’s bloodline. During your adventures you’ll learn more about these past events, of your own order and of those seeking to resurrect God, in an morally ambiguous tale with multiple endings (though based on a last-minute choice).Kult also has great world-building, with all quests and NPCs having their own reasonable motivations. You’ll hear about refugees from neighboring countries, tribal caste systems, sex workers fleeing slavery, etc.What dooms Kult is that all this is trapped inside a very poor Action-RPG. Combat is slow, tedious and extremely unbalanced (some skills are plain broken), map design is poor and monsters barely have any skills or abilities – even the bosses just run at you.The skill system is similar to some JRPGs, where each equipment piece can teach a new skill if you use it enough. Sadly, most skills are dull passive bonuses and the few magic spells are all automatically cast, so you’ll just right-click on enemies the whole game.Kult is a game in conflict with itself – at one point you’ll be playing a boring Diablo-clone; at another you’ll be exploring a large city full of NPCs, uncovering secrets of the past and taking sides in a faction war between thieves, with barely any killing involved.The good news is that Kult is short (6-8 hours), and doesn’t overstay it welcome. As such, it’s worth giving it a chance – you’ll likely enjoy most of its good parts before tiring of the bad ones."

It's one of the few games I've finished and that even multiple times.It's very enjoyable to play because of the unique class system and spirit world addition, and I shouldn't forget to mention the still-beautiful art.I highly recommend it if you can still enjoy older games and like off-beat class systems."
76561197994971393,Recommended,277650,31613364,Posted: 7 May,all,Occupant,"This is a dated, unpolished, but interesting Diablo-clone. It can be difficult to enjoy the game through the lack of modern conveniences common in the genre (such as no ability to highlight loot, no obvious denotation of area transitions, no large scale map, et cetera).But if you can see through those dated and unpolished flaws, the game itself is rather interesting. The method of advancement is one that is seldom seen - it reminded me of the old Marvel superhero roleplaying pen and paper system. The game is surprisingly dense with content in the form of world-building dialog and side quests. Talking to background NPCs is quite rewarding for people interested in the setting of the game. The Dreamworld aspect of the game is also clever, and is woven into the mechanics of the game in an interesting way.I wasn't a huge fan of the art style. The starting art sequence looked more like a centerfold from a fantasy Playboy magazine than a serious game introduction. But the rest of the game seemed to have a much more sensible approach to hand-drawn art elements.All in all, an interesting game for fans of isometric adventure games, but expect a lack of modern polish."

The story is pretty good and not as trite as many other fantasy rpgs.The graphics do look very dated now, so I won't be playing it again (got it for free with the new Heretic KIngdoms game), but if you have never played it, it's worth a look."
76561198072155841,Recommended,277650,34029555,Posted: 4 August,all,zeranixaimar,"I didn't know the game Kult: Heretic Kingdoms at all until I bought its sequel Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms. After 12 hours' game play, I finished the main storyline. I recommend this game to old-school ARPG fans.Even for a game published in 2004, the visual and acoustic effects of Kult would not have been satisfactory at that time. The characters, backgrounds, and animations are very crude. Most pieces of BGM are short and are repated endless, and the sound effects feel cheap.The combat system of this game is diablo-like but has its own shining points, where you need to attune with your equipement (i.e. learning a skill from each piece of equipment by successfully hitting enemies for enough number of times while meeting some prerequisites) and you need to choose a limited number from them to enhance your combat abilities.The enemies are designed rather straightforward, lacking variation, and even bosses don't have anything special except that they possess higher HP and damage.There are also some minor problems about the UI. It is especially painful to manage your inventory, since you need to open the containers a lot of time for storing and retrieving items. However, these are acceptable for a game of over ten years old.在买Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms之前，我从来没听说过Kult: Heretic Kingdoms这个游戏。有天试玩了一下感觉还可以，就花了大概12小时通关了。Kult是个类似Diablo的ARPG游戏，不过剧情要丰富很多，推荐给喜欢老派欧美角色扮演游戏的玩家。画面和声音表现即使放在2004年也不太行，人物、背景和动作都比较粗糙，背景音乐每首都很短，翻来覆去地放。音效（尤其脚步声）感觉比较廉价，而且在营造打击感方面作用不到位。除了剧情比较出色之外，战斗系统也有些亮点。这游戏不像一般ARPG那样是有技能树，而是你要从各种武器装备上学习attunement skills（同调技能），也就是在满足一定条件的前提下运用对应的武器来打击敌人从而获得装备经验值（普通攻击每命中一次是1点装备经验值，敌人掉落的精华每个5点）。学会技能之后装备就可以卖掉了。在主角休息时，你可以从已经学会的技能中选择一些（数量受人物等级限制）与你现有的装备进行搭配。所以需要随时注意自己用的武器、盔甲、元素类型，才能达到最佳的技能效果。有点像FF7练晶石的感觉。敌人AI略低，boss也是，除了血和伤害提高之外也没有什么特殊攻击之类的，打起来有点单调。另外界面有一些小的问题。主要是道具栏空间太小，又不支持自动把捡来的物品直接塞进额外的背包（4格、9格以及更大的皮包），每次打开好几个包装东西卖东西都要折腾半天……"

You enter the monastery, kill a few adversaries in the real world as well as the dreamworld and you feel like this game is really something. Next up the atunement(passives) system comes up which allows you custamize your build in various ways in terms of defense, utility and elemental augmentation. The way the main character will fight depends on your skill choices between 4 simple fighting styles. Hell at the start of the game you can even try different atunements with your skills since you are not invested into one of them heavly. You can choose between light, heavy and no armor all of which affecting your attack speed. Become a tank that soaks damage, train as an archer that shoot arrows like a machinegun or a light-armour wearing one with slower and safer attacks. Be a mage and blast everything away. So many choices at the beginning and once you invest in a branch you can later choose between elementals and each of them offer different builds. We have sucha great setting, a wonderful city full of quest and a great skills-passive combination that we never need to use.The enemies in this game are pretty much braindead. They run at you until they die. You are faster than 90 %percent of your enemies, they have no gap closers, no spells, no mobs. They get stuck at terrain, even bosses stare at you until you shoot them to death. None of them enemies turn into little eel like creatures after they die or duplicate themselves when they are close to death like in many other great Diablolikes. None of the boss battles are interesting, hell sometimes you kill them so fast you dont even realize they were bosses. There are next to no resistances on enemies, you can pretty much focus on fire elemental weapons and blast them away. Every enemy from the start of the game to the end is the same. It really doesnt matter if you invested all of your point into beeing a ranger, you can simply take a spear without any enhancing from atunements and maul through them easly. Such a great skill system wasted on nothing. The only interesting thing in this game is the city and its various quest."

But I do know I hadn't made it as far as I currently am.At times, I wish the combat was different - when fighting a ""boss"" I am usually surrounded by minions to fend off first. When I finally unlocked certain attunements, I was estatic. Being able to reflect damage that I block is a plus. Also lighting my enemies on fire with a swipe of my weapon helps."

,Not Recommended,277650,18586368,"Posted: 20 October, 2015",all,Brian,Amateurish is perhaps the most favorable description I would apply to this game.  The background/world has a permanently blurred appearance.  The controls are crude and don't follow the usual convetions for games of this type.  I readily admit I didn't get very far or give it much of a chance beyond the first 5 minutes.  There was simply nothing about it which compelled me to go any further.
