76561197988012862,Recommended,277680,13337124,"Posted: 12 December, 2014",all,mendel,"(My first impression after 75 of 80 levels.) This is a puzzle game. It is not a platformer. You can't even jump. There is no story. There is no timer. You can't die, but you can get stuck, and then you need to restart or undo your last moves. Each level fits on a single screen, no scrolling.You guide two black dudes, love and hate, and they can pull or push other dudes around and step on them and on each other to reach the big red button. Since they can't jump and can only climb one step (unless they find one of these updraft hats and position it just right), this usually requires careful planning. You get to meet different ""others"" as the game goes on. Yes, it's a mobile port, which is why you don't move your dudes directly, but the pathing is fine -- all you need to do is to click on where you want them to go, and they will, if they can. If you misclick, there's undo.The first 10  levels are the tutorial. It looks like the art changes after every 20 levels, for a total of 4 ""worlds"", so there are some 80 levels total. (I think there used to be 70, and they added 10 when the iPad version came out.)  The difficulty of the level varies quite a bit; they take me anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes to solve, so let's call it easy to medium diffculty.I would love for the PC version of this game to have bigger levels, an editor, and Steam Workshop; what is has right now is a small price tag (I got an 80% off coupon for owningTiny & Big), and enough of a challenge to justify it.So the question is, how long to beat it? Well, that depends on how smart you are. As I stated up front, I have  beat 50 levels so  far, so the game should be good for 3 hours at least. Is the game inspiring me to beat it? Not really. I think the logic pathways of my brain that can solve ""move boxes around"" type of games have been exercised plenty before, by games as complex and inspiring as Tetrobot; and that the part of me that wants plenty of small puzzles when I'm bored is still in love with Lyne and its originality (do get Lyne on a touch device).I like puzzle games, I got this 80% off, I certainly didn't regret getting this game, it's a solid puzzler.

The idea is pretty simple: you control Love and Hate in an attempt to get from point A to point B.  You click where you want them to go and they go there.  Love has the ability to influence Lumps towards him while Hate has the ability to push Lumps away.Like most puzzle games, the puzzles start off simple and get progressively more difficult.  I haven't played this game too much, but I've already come across a couple good Head Scratchers in terms of difficulty (or maybe I'm just not good at puzzle games).In summation, this game is a fun, casual puzzle game if you're looking for one.  The controls are simple but the puzzles get progressively more difficult.7/10"

In fact, it's a very good puzzle game - it may have the looks of a platformer, but just likeToki Tori, to which it shows some resemblances, its not. The developers are the four guys of  Black Pants Studio, a German indie development studio who have given us the amazingTiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftover/ in 2012. With this second game, released late 2014, they have really established themselves as a studio to watch.Controlling two small cubes, representing the two characters love and hate, the player can alter his surroundigs to a certain extent by influencing the position or behaviour of ""the other ones"". This in order to get to the ""red button"", which has to be pushed to move on to the next level. An amazingly simple and original concept, almost executed to perfection. Almost, since the difficulty of the 80 levels rather varies a lot: the first ones are, as they should be, very simple, but the more difficult ones are not only found towards the end, but also quite early on. This may discourage players looking for a very relaxing session, but its only a very minor quibble. Some may even find it an advantage. Otherwise, this game offers the perfect amount of casual gameplay, to be taken in as short snippets as one wants since most levels can be completed in a couple of minutes or less.The visual style is spot-on too, with four different worlds offering the necessary contrasts yet staying within the same basic concept. A few cutscenes offer some cute, silent storytelling, where the two minimalistic figures even manage to convey some emotions. Great!Overall score: 8,5/10"

It starts off very simple but it slowly increases the difficulty. So far up to level 41, none of the puzzles were annoying but they do ramp up in difficulty as I played which I find a good sign in a puzzle game. You can take back moves and restart at any time so no complete backtracking was needed if I misclicked when almost done with a puzzle.The graphics are charming and the appearance and voices of our two protagonists fit them well; Love is round and has a flower on his head with a loud friendly voice while Hate is sharp and harsh with a hissing voice that sounds like hate indeed. The cast of characters so far fit the atmosphere and the only negatives I can really say is that it took awhile to get a larger variety of characters in the puzzles.Puzzle games are not my main style but some are quite good and this is certainly one of best."

It is a puzzle game that focuses on you alternating between two characters and using their special abilities of pushing and pulling blocks to complete puzzles. The game is fairly slow paced and doesn’t really ever reach a level of difficulty that makes you want to slam your face on your desk and give up like a good puzzle game should. You will quickly burn through 30 levels and wonder when you’re going to get to the actual meat and potatoes of the game.The way this game was designed feels like a game that was designed with mobile platforms in mind as the levels are something you could easily accomplish while waiting in a line or going to the bathroom, not necessarily the kind of game you would want to binge through on your home PC. As you progress through the game, it does continually introduce interesting gameplay mechanics to attempt to maintain some level of freshness to the level design, such as teleporting, blocks that make you fly, and (literally) dead bodies that act as immovable walls, however; the lack of difficulty remains prevalent throughout which hardly makes the game worth a second run through once you complete the level.The game is charming and you can easily sink about 3 hours of gameplay into it before you’ve had your fill and decide to move on to the next game. At an asking price of 6.99 this may be a steep premium to pay for the number of hours you will invest in the game, however be sure to double check your inventory for a coupon that knocked the game down significantly lower to $1.40 which at that price you might as well pick it up and test it out."

Aesthetically it's utterly delightful - Though the rest of the game is unlikely to blow your socks off. It’s super-casual and the lack of level music leaves it feeling a little sterile and uninviting.Annoyingly, it has a very gentle learning curve... So it was only around the late level 50's (over halfway) that they started to make me scratch my head and require me to study the screen a bit more. From that point though, it's been a lovely little title to dip into and get a few good ""Ah! That puzzle was cool!"" moments.

Love has a calling which draws objects towards him and hate has the opposite effect. Their objective is to simply hit a red button located somewhere on the level so that they can teleport themselves to the next level. The thing is, it doesn't matter which one hits it, as long as one of them does. Therefore the game especially at the start is quite easy, like a walk in the park. In fact, often I found I could solve certain area's ignoring many facets on the screen, probably due to oversights of the level designer and out of the box thinking by myself, as there were two or three ways to solve many of the problems.There are 80 levels in total and as you traverse each level, over time you come across a couple more obstacles each with their own perks and introduction cut scene animation. The obstacles in reference are ...'Lazy' - A block that travels in the direction of the call being made.'Dead' - A block that refuses to respond.'Blowing' - An upside down hat which causes an updraft of air that can be used as an elevator. It also has the ability of moving in the direction of a call being made.'Afraid' - A block which flattens itself when called by 'hate' and goes back to normal to 'loves' call.'Cold' - A block which exchanges its current position with the exact position of the caller.'Magic' - A upside down hat which travels in the direction of the call made and makes obstacles disappear which are in its way.All these quirky obstacles are known as the 'other ones' and a set amount of them are already in position on each level. Since each puzzle map fits on a single screen, no scrolling is required. Instead from the get go your goal is simply to locate the red button and to figure out what you will need in order to reach it, and then work a way of getting those obstacles/instruments there through the orchestration of 'Love' and 'Hates' calling.In all truthfulness the game really felt like it had the park brake on from get go. It's really slow at the start and kind of just dawdles along. Then when you get to around level 70 before you know it, the park brake is off and you’ve flown over a guard rail and you just don't know what the hell you’re doing. From level 70 onward the difficulty is WAY INCREASED. It seriously goes from teeter totter brain dead place the shapes in the corresponding holes type of difficulty, to your now playing chess and have to declare checkmate within 30 moves level of difficulty.The game tries to be cute, but never kind of reaches that plateau I wanted and my emotions never really became invested in their little welfare. Problem is that other than going forward through the levels, you’re not making a difference to any of the backgrounds. You’re not restoring the colourful kingdoms of the blobs and neither are you required to defeat any princess stealing nemesis by whizzing them through the air with their tail.Still I enjoyed it and it did have me REALLY stumped a few times, but without achievements, involved storytelling and workshop your satisfaction will be rather short-lived. Still a worthy little puzzle to place in your library if you get a chance and if it goes on sale.Now that I have given this a thumbs up and said 'I love you', hopefully black pants studio will move one step closer to their customers and give them what they need to hit that thumbs up button.

And by underrated, I don't mean ""a game I like that no one else does"". Most people who play it love it. It's won several awards, and for good reason too.So why am I reviewing it now? Because it deserves an audience.GameplayThis is a puzzle game, not in the sense that Tetris is, but in the sense that Lemmings or Toki Tori is. Just like Lemmings or Toki Tori, your goal is to figure out ways beyond obstacles en route to an exit.But of course, there's a twist. You control two characters:Love, which attracts NPCs towards itHate, which repels NPCs away from itThink of Love as the character that ""pulls"", and Hate as the character that ""pushes"". And you'll be doing a lot of that because NPCs will either help or hinder you from getting to your goal.As for why they're trying to get to their goal? They pressed a red button, and now they're trapped in a place far away from home and must find their way back. As with many puzzlers, the story isn't so important.What is important is how accessible this game is. It will appeal to many people. Moms should love this, and toddlers should love this. In fact, my toddler very much loved this, and it held her attention for quite some time. It's an easy to understand puzzler that is equally easy to pick up and play.GraphicsThis neither utilizes polygon nor pixel art. Instead, it opts for what looks like hand-drawn art with a mix of charcoal and watercolours. This gives it a style that resembles children's book illustrations.The graphics for this game look amazing. The kicker is that they don't require horsepower. This is a case where art really does make a statement. The style is whimsical and fun, and is easy to love.You don't need a whole lot of optimizing to enjoy it. I've run this game in resolution as low as 640x480, and as high as 1920x1080. In an array of configurations, it looks great.SoundThe game uses music at the main menu and loading screens, but when you actually play it, it opts for ambient sounds. Which is fine by me because when I'm playing a puzzler, I like to have room to ponder.As far as effects are concerned, they mostly accentuate an action. When you move, there's subtle footsteps. When an NPC does something, you hear a pop.The most noteworthy aspect of the sound is when you get your characters to attract or repel. When Love attracts, it says, ""I love you."" When Hate repels, it says, ""I hate you."" Adults might find this slightly annoying, but I assure you that kids think it's pretty cool. In the event you don't like it, the game gives you the option to turn off the sound without turning off the system sound.ControlsThis is as simple for a PC game to control as it gets. You don't use a keyboard. Everything is driven by the mouse and left click. There's never a point in which you require a right click.Would you rather play this on a couch with your Steam controller? The default right trackpad and right trigger emulate a mouse perfectly.That said, there are issues with control. In order to get a character to interact with an NPC, you have to click the character then the NPC. Yet sometimes instead of interacting with an NPC, your character walks towards it. This is annoying because it sometimes results in your character getting into a bind. Thankfully, the game gives you the option to undo, so it's never too much of a hassle.SynopsisCertain gamers may roll their eyes at About Love, Hate and the other ones -- deeming it too ""casual"". But if by ""casual"" they mean ""accessible to nearly anyone"", guilty as charged.Besides, if you were a PC gamer back in the late 80s/early 90s, you might be thirsty for a game similar to Lemmings. I'm happy to say that this, along with MouseCraft, shows that this style of puzzler is still going strong.If you're around children, here's something that will keep them entertained for hours on end. I hate to use the phrase ""family friendly"" because those are usually weasel words for justifying dreck, but here's a game all ages will enjoy."

It keeps being interesting - they throw in easier levels (where you juggle new concepts) with more challenging ones where you have to really think on how to apply them to reach the solution.

The game takes a sharp difficulty spike near the end with some tougher puzzles that I don't feel the previous levels quite prepared the player for, though nothing is too terribly difficult overall.

That pretty much earns a recommendation right there, but let’s explore for a bit.Pros:- With this game, not only do you get somewhat of a challenge (depending on how quickly you can figure out puzzles), but also an incredible art style and adorable little characters.- Cute concept – Hate, as shown on the right in the picture above, can force the other ones away by interacting with them, and Love, on the left, can bring them toward him. Love and Hate have to work together most levels to reach the button, which then advances you to the next level.- I was stumped on a few levels and had to take a break before being able to solve them.- 4 total scenes for this game – cave, castle, machine, and ice mountain – that provide a good contrast to the same basic structure.Cons:- A bit short – not enough levels/range of difficulty for me.- I’d say this is only an easy to medium ranged puzzle game. If you play it straight through like I tried to do, it may get more difficult. My brain decides to poop out on me every once in a while."

There are a few levels where the difficulty is really ramped up. There are video walkthroughs available but sometimes even after seeing a solution I wondered how I was supposed to have figured that out.While I enjoyed this game overall, I'm not sure who to recommend it to. If you enjoy straining your brain on hard puzzle games the bulk of this may be too easy for you. If you like a more casual experience then some of the levels, especially towards the end, may really frustrate you. I would say it is worth a try when on sale for sure."

It later turned into a headache, though. It really isn't a BAD or HORRIBLE game. It simply stops being fun, way too soon.The game has a simple concept which is easy to grasp, It's basically a puzzle platformer where you have two buddies - Love and Hate, and you have to make one of them push a button. That simple. The way is lined with obstacles, of course, or we'd have no game, right?The trouble is that the game is not done too interestingly, and while being a good port of the mobile game, it really fails to feel ""fun"" all the way through. I've finished most of the levels but at the very beginning I felt I'm playing it just to finish the game, really.About Love, Hate and the other ones gets too boring, too repetitive, too tedious, and too soon, unfortunately. There are some challanging levels but most are really not (except for the very last 10-15 levels, maybe).Generally, not much was done too keep us entertained and intrigued. Leaving the gameplay aside, the graphics are OK but nothing special, there are barely any sound effects or any effects at all (except for the ""I love you, I looooooooove you, I hate you"" you'd keep hearing over and over and would probably want to mute eventually). There's no story whatsoever. There's nothing much, in short.This game is pure casual stuff, which is not necessarily bad, but here it simply doesn't work that well.This is not a bad game, not at all, but it really isn't anything too good. It's probably nice to beat a level once in a while, once in a week or so. But for games like this, I'd say to just keep them in the smartphone. Otherwise it gets pretty tiring."

Speaking of click, it's nearly all click based, while this isn't a bad thing I certainly don't like it, you can easily mess up, which leads me to believe that's why they put the undo option in, but that subtracts from the difficulty of any puzzle, which makes me think this game is more suited for a younger audience.I give it a 3/10 I don't necessarily hate it, nor do I love it..

I imagine that those with a good mind for puzzles could beat the game in about 2 hours, less skilled individuals would possibly take no more than 3.5-4.If you're looking for something mildly fun to kill time, look no furthar.

Plays pretty slowly, but manages to plumb some surprising depths given the simplicity of the mechanic. There's no real platforming to speak of, they can only hop up one square at a time, and each move can be undone. All this is to say it's definitely a puzzle game, not a platformer (for those to whom that sort of thing matters).The art is nice, the music is fun, the SFX are fine (though wear out fairly quickly). The controls work well. It feels very well put together and polished, despite also very much feeling like a mobile port.The puzzles themselves aren't bad, a little uneven maybe. Some puzzles have multiple solutions, including solutions that bypass pretty much the whole level (which leads me to believe they may be that way unintentionally).

It's a short game (4-ish hours gameplay) and fun to solve the little puzzles. There are only 80 levels, however some of them can be very tricky! I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys puzzle games + the ""I love you"" and ""I hate you"" is funny to listen to. Definitely 8.5 / 10 - just wish there were more levels."
