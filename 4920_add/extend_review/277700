,Recommended,277700,24163523,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,Art as Games,"I'm kinda flabbergasted that this game hasn't received exponentially higher media attention, because it's one of the best platformers I've played since Super Meat Boy. It's a fluid, fast-paced game that requires players to switch between one of two body types on the fly, all while dodging lasers, mines, missiles, and the like. It's very similar to Super Meat Boy in that lightspeed-dodging regard, but it also has some excellent nonverbal humor and subtle social commentary. If you like challenging platformers and charming worlds, On Rusty Trails is one of the best offerings to come along in quite some time."

If you like ""purist"" platformers where it's all about the game mechanics and few controls, not luck or items, this is a must buy. Controls are top notch, smooth  and predictable (I'd recommend a gamepad for the best experience.) Difficulty curve was just right - when you fail it's always clear why, retries are quick and you can continuously feel how your skills are building. Frustration is minimized with frequent checkpoints. What made this stand out for me especially is the quality of the sound track. The art style is also amazing. Only downside is that it's pretty short (about 3 hours for me). Still absolutely worth it."
,Not Recommended,277700,30086942,Posted: 21 February,all,Maxmetpt,"I really liked Tiny & Big: Granpa's Leftovers a while back (one of the few games that was very much like a collect-a-ton like SM64, yet had very modern mechanics, and gave you a lot of freedom which made exploring really satisfying!), and they also have a mobile game (about batteries?) that I found pretty cool. So I had my eye on this one and bought it on the winter sale.This game has a their distinct style all over, but especially in the music! It's great!The visuals are good as well, but more in style than impressiveness, I guess? They look a bit crude, but style makes up for it.Unfortunately, while I liked some of the game, I don't see a main purpose to it. The platforming feels good, and while the mechanics aren't completely original, that isn't a problem, if the levels make the game a beast of its own. But it didn't really seem the case, here.Difficulty-wise, it's very soft, for the most part. A couple challenging sections, perhaps, but nothing lasting. And the levels are way too short, mostly under 20 seconds long on your first try. When I play Super Meat Boy, I can end the levels very quickly. But that's because I have planned routes and lots of practice.In here, all of that seems almost given from the start, and the levels don't really have many different approaches.As I said, though, the mechanics aren't very original. So novelty is also limited. Since you stick to every wall (even at angles), there is some novelty to it (and I'll write more further in the review about this), but not enough to seem the meat of the experience at all.The story is also very barebones, told through panels spread through the levels (very stylish ones!) and some hidden rooms. But, again, not really the point.Finally, there are tokens spread around the levels, for you to find/collect. This was actually a very cool mechanic! Basically,  you needed a token to activate a checkpoint. But you'd lose it in the process. So it could make for some cool level design, where you had to ""assign"" tokens to choose the checkpoints carefully, perhaps.None of that happened (although it did provide some more challenge in the process). Here's what happened: I tried to collect every token in my first try. Since most levels are under 20 seconds, checkpoints aren't very important. So I tried to ignore all of them in the first go.In hindsight, this was a bit of a misuse of the mechanic, but hey... The upside was that some checkpoints required some finessenot to activate! If you touch them, you lose a token. So I was actually fighting against the checkpoints not to lose tokens! That was cool. But it happened rarely. So, again, it seemed like an accident in design more so than a deliberate choice? Or at least not a very determinate choice.From all of this rambling, I hope I've gotten the point across, somewhat. The game seems to have a few cool ideas, but they're only touched superficially. They never go all in and make a level where you have to take things into consideration. Instead, you mostly go through the motions for the whole game.Maybe I just wasn't in the right state of mind when I started this game, and so lacked the motivation to enjoy throughout, I don't know. But I think the point is valid.There are also other problems, structure/interface wise.Speedrunning seems encouraged, since you're given your leaderboard position at the end of the level. But you can't see other players' times (on the game), so the competition doesn't get very fierce.The token you collect in a level are also kept, even if you die. This means that some challenging sections are made much easier if you just collect the token and die, and then go through the easy path.Sometimes the game is rather unclear about its rules. etc.These are minor problems, but it seems to add up in the end. It's not quite there yet, as a great game, I think. Which surprised me, seeing all the praise in the other reviews. Maybe I'm wrong!If you like their style, give the game ago. It's not a bad game, it just seemed to fall short of being noteworthy."

,Recommended,277700,24000082,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,awildbrysen,"On Rusty Trails is a indie platformer game created by Black Pants Studio that revolves around fast thinking and fast reactions. It boast some very simple but fun mechanics. The base mechanic is switching between “modes” to open up different routes or platforms. Other mechanics are getting very nicely introduced by in-game visuals or NPC interactions. This together with the great level design makes for several different ways to solve every level. You have for example the fastest route, the route with all the tokens or all the checkpoints. It creates a scaling difficulty level and a replayability value if you want to complete it in different ways. Easy to learn hard to master, these are the controls of On Rusty Trails. They can really work well and create a great flow in the game, but some jumps are so hard. It takes a lot of time to practice and get it straight, it’s so hard I found myself irritated by the controls.Visually it is very stylized, it has a special feel to it and it looks amazing. The different levels and their own atmosphere, the bright and vivid colors give a lively feeling while the darker levels give you a scared and compressed feeling. There were just some minor problems. Sometimes it was hard to see what was standable and what was background and sometimes you die or get a checkpoint while you didn’t pass or hit it. This infuriated me while trying to get my 100% run.Auditory this game is great. I really like the soundtrack and it sets the atmosphere. It has a cool beat to keep you going in the game. The sound effects feel very alive and they have a certain effectiveness to it. While playing the game without sound I missed the sound of Elvis clinging to the blocks, the leafs clattering, the searing magma and the lasers trying to burn me. It’s also handy as a sound cue in the later stages of the game.Overall the game is a experimental platformer with fun new ideas. It has a global leaderboard which shows how many people are faster than you and it invites to speedrun. On Rusty Trails packs a 2-3 hour playtime to complete it if you are familiar with the genre. Luckily there is quite some replay value in this game so the 2-3 hours quickly expanded to 12 hours for me. The controls weren’t always great and the visuals have a few irritating quirks. But apart from that it’s still a solid game that I would recommend to fans of the genre and non-fans alike."

76561198024153634,Recommended,277700,30363162,Posted: 6 March,all,Jemini,"Really great platformer. Movement feels as fluid as Super Meat Boy and the core mechanic of switching suits is used fantastically well and serve to drive both the story and the oddly poignant social commentary. Enviornments are nice and the game offers a comfortable, but never impossible challenge near the end. The artstlye is fun and the fluidty of the game and its main mechanic make speedrunning and competing on leaderboards a blast. There's also a great collectible challenge with secret areas littered throughout the game.On my rig the performance sometimes tanked. Several levels had trouble picking up inputs involved in complex jumps. The optimization of the game seems to be a little questionable while the options, and fullscreen, didn't work. Also, I adored the soundtrack in Tiny Big. The soundtrack here is more subtle and ambient, but never impressive. I just muted the soundtrack and had my own music playing.I had a blast with this game. I never leaderboard, but the fluidity of platforming makes me want to go back and try to speedrun each stage. While performance dipped and I struggled with input dropping on certain levels, I never was too frustrated. It's a linear but well-paced platformer with a unique mechanic at its core that permeates throughout each design choice. I highly recommend it."
,Recommended,277700,32294491,Posted: 9 June,all,The_Enderwolf,"On Rusty Trails is a great platformer that uses multiple mechanics. The story revolves around Elvis, who just had their house destroyed by a meteor. Elvis remembered they had insurance that granted a new house for free and set off. The idea, concept, and reason to traverse the area is great. I found On Rusty Trails through a discount from crafting badges. If you like platformers, you will like On Rusty Trails."

The cute story, as well as some hidden rooms, provide proper motivation. However, (missed) achievements and even the well included leader board did not motivate me to play again.I'm looking forward to a DLC with more levels! ;)"
,Recommended,277700,26082162,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,Cyril,"This game is... very meh. Very average. There's a lot of good points and a lot of bad points.Good stuff: The visual style is pretty nice and the game's general pacing is pretty solid, there are few instances of having to stop moving and wait for stuff, though they are present. There's also a decent number of neat gimmicks, especially in the last world, and the main mechanics are solid on the whole.Bad stuff: A lot of weird, clunky level design and weird level design choices that just feel... off. The game's insistence on using checkpoints as an obstacle for 100% completion. The final boss fight is absolute trash and goes against the game's basic mechanics. The audio is a bit mediocre. Your character feels a bit small onscreen and it can get hard to tell where you are at points. Also there's one random level where you can't get no death and all tokens at the same time.I don't really have a strong opinion on this game either way but it's generally decent entertainment, and an okay length for the price (5 or so hours to play through getting all tokens and no deaths, and then a bit more to find the last secrets and achievements). Replaying it probably softened my opinion on it as well since it's, well, decent platforming when it wants to be.I can't say I'd return to it though either. It's just very... fine, with a few roadbumps along the way, a few bad levels, and that final boss is really, truly terrible."
,Recommended,277700,23549128,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,"yes, this is tim","A very tight, well-designed, well-concieved, polished platformer firmly in the vein of N and Super Meat Boy and Dustforce and all that good stuff. There's just enough new mechanics here to set it apart - the polarity-swapping thing lends itself to some very cool platforming setups late in the game, and lends itself to a very nice jump-swap-jump-swap rhythm. Controls are tight and fluid in that special way that just feelsgood.The excellent sound design and art all hits this very Meatboy-ish line of being quirky enough to have a distinct personality but not so much that it gets on your nerves.My only gripes are:- It's not lacking in value for money, but it feels like a disservice to such a well-designed game that some of the coolest mechanics are only used in the very last area. Maybe I'm just neurotic, but I would've liked the difficulty curve to be a bit steeper, and perhaps another area or two to really milk every last drop of potential.- The final boss requires a skillset that has little to do with everything you've learned up to that point. A bit of an unsatisfying mess, but mercifully short.Anyway, I flew through this the day it came out, and it kept me pretty engaged the whole time. It doesn't quite match its influences in eliciting that twitchy platformer trance state of an afternoon of endless retries, but it does carve a nice little niche for itself where it puts on a solid effort."

I just can't deal with the stress of any more Super Meat Boy-style quick-reaction platformers, and didn't realise it was in that vein when I bought it.BUT, if you're in market for more of that type of punishment, this is brilliant! Loads of character, a great world and overriding (but unintrusive) narrative, in which the color-switching mechanic reveals a racist and prejudiced society. Gameplay is very fluid and fair, controls are excellent. I really hope more people notice this."

The game concept is also really interesting, but it is not well executed. It is very easy to forget where the character is because the character is really small and there is a lack of contrast between it and the background. The checkpoint system idea is very interesting but it is annoying that checkpoints activate automatically when you step on them, at least when you are trying to complete the stage without using them."
