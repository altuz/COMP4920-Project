,Not Recommended,277870,16592276,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,gr8stalin's mustache!,"There are way too many reviews for this game spouting cheap, repetitive, barely-descriptive one-liners like “Link to the Past meets Roguelikes!!! A+ very good game!!!” or “Homage to old dungeon crawlers” when the fact of the matter is that it’s just not a very good game. The best thing it does is work without crashing.The weapons given to the player character are a cannon launcher and a sword. These deal unimpressive amounts of damage even with upgrades. There are also perks that the player can pick up a-la Binding of Isaac for abilities. Unlike BoI, however, these perks don’t really change the way that the game is played too much since they either allow the player to avoid hazards or tack on slight effects to the two weapons (e.g., cannonball explosions spawning tiny pools of fire). The player can upgrade their treasure chest companion by collecting gems to the point where it will fire spikes at enemies or dash around into enemies but those are the only other attack that can be performed.There are a lot of different sprites for enemy types but they all follow the same pattern: +forward. Everything either runs towards or away from the player, including bosses. This, in combination with the weapons, makes combat really boring and shallow. The gameplay doesn’t particularly change much outside of the included minigame, which is essentially Pac-Man. Click to slash, click to shoot. There’s nothing like BoI’s bullet-hell, active abilities, or item synergy. There’s nothing like Ziggurat’s arena shooter approach to survival (good movement, good positioning, good aim). There’s nothing like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup/Tales of Maj’Eyal/Nethack/others where items and random events legitimately change the player’s experience (e.g., Bearosphere in ToME). In essence, it’s LoZ: A Link to the Past without anything that made LTTP good fused with the permadeath behind Roguelikes.The art design is explicitly stated as a “nostalgic 16-bit look and feel” but there’s so much dark and grey and brown, any attempt to have anything that looks at the very least different is crushed. Hammerwatch tackles “retro” in a far superior graphical manner, and Darkest Dungeon utilize black, brown, and grey to create a foreboding atmosphere. Diehard Dungeon just looks like a flash game. There is also a lot of screen clutter in Diehard Dungeon; broken barrels and boxes covering up progression items (keys), tiny shelled critters running around everywhere that don’t deal damage, bouncing spinning spikewheels, etc, all in a small room. Others might say that ""this just helps cover up traps!!!"" but the fact that it's really easy to see where the physical traps themselves are (spike walls, arrow holes, etc.) defeats the purpose of hiding the trigger.The XP system and ability system are completely useless. The only thing gaining XP does is increase the difficulty of the mobs and doesn’t change anything about the player. No power bonus, no extra abilities, nothing. All abilities are acquired via RNG chests where players play slot machines for random abilities, which determine the player’s pace; if the abilities picked up are useful, the player can actually play the game at a reasonable pace. If the abilities are garbage, players are forced to plink away at enemies until the odds roll in their favor. Another reviewer described the game as “tedious” and I can’t help but agree; it’s not afuntimesink, it’s not a game one can leave running in the background like a clicker game, but it requires the player’s undivided attention to open the exit to the current room. It feels familiar but unlike the claims, it does nothing unique or out of the ordinary.It’s fitting that Diehard Dungeon was released on Steam on September 11th because this game is a disaster. Spend your $5 (or $0.99 if on sale) somewhere else."
,Recommended,277870,9361143,"Posted: 6 March, 2014",all,HypnoJuice,"[Edit] An option was added by the devs to remove the flashing! Now i've gotta come up with other things to talk about in the Review :DI'm a really big fan of action roguelikes, so I'm quite happy to see more coming out and I instantly wanted to give this a shot.My first reaction to seeing the trailer was to think that the game may be too derivative of The Binding of Isaac, but luckily I tried out the game and saw how wrong I was.This game has a striking resembalance to The Binding of Isaac, as they're both of the same genre and are both seemingly inspired by older entires in the Zelda franchise. The similarites don't go too far though, as it appears that Isaac was based off of the original Zelda, with every room having exactly the same dimensions, whereas Diehard has more similarities to Zelda: A Link to the Past.  The result is a much more organic experience, and your adventure focuses more on each unique room, rather than dungeon floors made up of  maze of bland square areas.The combat mechanics are also more developed, with the delver having a Zeldaesque sword for his primary attack, and a very interesting gun for his secondary attack.  This gun shoots bombs, which can cause damage to enemies on both impact and explosion, but cannot hurt the player directly.  The explosions of bombs push back both enemies and the player, and with the bombs propensity to ricochet around a room, it can make using it effectively quite tricky.  This results in deeper, trickier combat mechanics than one would expect, and adds a certain richness.A final added bonus Diehard Dungeon has over BoI is that it doesn't rely on blood, poop, tears and gore to have an atmospheric experience.Overall it was a good experience, and with the low price tag the devs seem to be selling themselves short, though it does certainly help spread the love faster :)[Original Complaint]While the gameplay was fairly enjoyable, the game overuses a visual effect which makes the entire screen flash white very quickly without warning. I play far too many videogames, and I'm virtually never affected by any kind of flashing lights(besides the seizure inducing flashes in Guacamelee!) but these flashes are definitely responsible for giving me a headache, and turning an entertaining experience into a negative one.If this is patched out, I'd gladly give this game a thumbs up and would definitely give it another go, but at this point it's getting shelved after only a few runs.[/original complaint]"

Everytime I enter the dungeon is different, all rooms are randomly generated and you'll never know what's behind that next door!Personally I think the level up system is really cool; the better you get, the tougher the monsters get.

Although lacking in depth and length, this is a fun game to waste a bit of time on and would highly recommend picking it up."
76561198014665763,Not Recommended,277870,12502980,"Posted: 15 October, 2014",all,Rufus,"Sadly, the most accurate words I can find to describe Diehard Dungeon are 'tedious' and 'clunky', which is a shame because this could have been a very fun game.The second descriptor, clunky, is the easier to tackle so I'll go with that first. The controls in Diehard Dungeon are not particularly responsive and the combat mechanics make things awkward. Using a controller does help with some of the problems but even so, moving and turning in combat is generally bad.As to the 'tedious' part; well, many of the game's mechanics seem to be based around wasting as much of the player's time as possible. Here are some examples of what I am trying to convey:The majority of rooms can only be exited once a key has been placed in a lock. The key will be hidden somewhere in the room; perhaps in one of the many random objects in the room (every one of which takes multiple strikes to break open), perhaps on one of the hit-sponge enemies. There's no indication as to where the key will be and you will often spend fruitless minutes hacking away at boxes to find the key.Little pixie type creatures will often appear (most of the time from one of the previously mentioned boxes you are hacking open in search of the key) and steal your companion chest. Well, not properly steal the chest, like take it away to be found later on; they just grab it and run to the other side of the room. You can't collect any treasure without the chest so you can't just leave it behind. What you must do instead is chase the pixies around the room, slashing at them with your sword until you've killed them all and can get your chest back. The problem here is that the pixies are fast and will continually move away from the player character, whilst the character cannot move while swinging his sword. And so a merry game of trying to manouvre the pixies into a corner ensues. And this will happen every few rooms. It's not that difficult to get the chest back, it's just tedious and annoying.There are other exmples that I won't go into an extended explanation of as they all tend to end with the same reaction of 'Why am I doing this? What's the point?' and a feeling that your time has been wasted.Other, although much less prominent, annoyances exist in the game, such as: parts of broken objects covering the trigger plates for traps so you can't even see them, enemy attacks that cause you to drop your only melee weapon so you have to go running around to find it again, status effects that make you run in random directions (usually straight at the nearest wall) for an intolerably long time and the fact that the bomb launcher (secondary weapon) is about as effective as launching an attack on a Tiger tank with firecrackers.The final negatives about Diehard Dungeon are the bland graphics, uninspired dungeon design and the completely 'meh' soundtrack. Overall this is not a game I would recommend unless you have a whole load of time to waste on pointless tedium and absolutely nothing else to play."
76561198045260150,Not Recommended,277870,30974576,Posted: 6 April,all,Mr Indecisive,"The simplest way to describe Diehard Dungeon is a hybrid between 2D Zelda games and Rogue-like (or lite if you prefer) games.Pros:-Decent music. I enjoyed it, at least.-Challenging-Style/aesthetic. Classic pixel art with blood effects.Cons:-Dull combat. By far the biggest sticking point. Combat is most of the game, but it is not fun. Attacks are weak, most enemies just run toward you, and you are stuck with the same weapons the entire game through all attempts (sword and hand-cannon)-Upgrade RNG (entirely possible to get nothing at all).-Almost no continuation between lives. You get tokens that carry over. You can use them to unlock some mini games, and that is all you can outside of a run. During a run, you can occasionally spend them at token wells, but they're uncommon. Each run feels like you're starting from scratch (some people may like this; I did not).In summary, Diehard Dungeon is a tough game, and it is possible to sink a lot of time into it, but I was not having fun with it. There are more satisfying games in the genre. I would give this game a pass unless on a deep sale."

I would recommend it as it has most of the elements that fans of the genre like including permadeath, random upgrades, random dungeons, and a retro feel. The only problem that keeps me from loving this game is that it feels very slow, but only on the players end. The dungeons side on the other hand will seem very fast and can kill you in just seconds with the crazy amount of enemies on the screen (which is no problem at all of course.) The issue is that killing the enemies seems so slow sometimes with your cannon gun and tiny little dagger. Yes, you can upgrade both of those, but sometimes you wont get upgrades through out the dungeon if you are unlucky and it will just make things slower. One may argue ""that's what rogue-likes are all about. They are going to be tough."" This isn't really that kind of game. In this sort of game you want quick difficult gameplay where the upgrades make you feel like you are progressing even if the game is getting more tough. A few floors in and i'm doing the same damage. The only buffs I have make me immune to fire or that the chests wont be empty (yet you can still get unlucky and recieve nothing.) The game is fun. Just seems slow. I think it's safe to say that if you know what you are playing 5 dollars is a good price.LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE UPDATE THAT MAKES YOUR SWORD SLASH WAS A GREAT IMPROVMENT. IT IS A LOT MORE PLAYABLE FOR NOW. THE GAMEPLAY FEELNIG A BIT SLOW AS SAID IN THIS REVIEW STILL APPLIES A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT IS NOW ON THE RIGHT TRACK. CAPS LOCK YES."

Here's a list:- Everytime you enter a new room, all the enemies run to your place, gangin'up on you. So, if you're lucky enough to not die on the first 10 seconds while running through traps, you can manage to kill some enemies, and just enjoy the rest of the time on an empty room.- They put boxes above traps, making it invisible. This just lead to cheap deaths, and it's unecessary.- Sometimes when you got hit, you'll drop your weapon. As if the game is not hard enough, what about making you unable to attack? Again: UNECESSARY.- This is the most WEAK character I've ever seen! You gotta fight hordes of enemies with a stupid sword, and a cannon ball that is almost useless, because it push you into traps when it explodes. Even when you get some upgrades through chests, you still feel weak. Every enemy takes like 4~6 hits to kill, and there are too many at the same time.- I wish we could change the controls, to make it more like a Twin Stick Shooter. I mean, the cannon weapon could be the Right Stick. But there's no option for that. Instead, you can move the camera with that stick, which is sooo helpfull (because we all know that the camera kills alot of guys with one hit).They could just make this game something good, like Hero Siege, Binding of Isaac, or Nuclear Throne. The art style is so cool, and the gameplay is fast. But with a character that doesn't become stronger with time or get new abilities, it feels the same, and gets boring really fast."

Diehard Dungeon is, well, a dungeon where you die - hard.It starts out easy, but as you progress and your rank increases, you get put into more difficult dungeons with chaos exponentially growing (hopefully with your skill also growing at the same rate).

Along your trek, you will stumble upon little games that will give you fantastic items (like the Forget-me-Not) and will prolong the little game, which, at it's core, is basically you standing in the corner, firing your gun at the approaching enemies, and collecting LOTS of loot with your Companion Chest (who, in fact, is a GREAT companion)It's repetitive in nature, but with all the content inside, it's difficult to get bored.7/10"

,Not Recommended,277870,12433151,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,Solinarius,"After not even having played 30 minutes, I am exasperated. I'm compelled to compare the combat and weapons of this game to the first Legend of Zelda. While the combat in Zelda is simple, it is polished and immersive on a level this game does not come close to matching. This is primarily due to Diehard Dungeon's combination of an ultimately unremarkable arsenal, boring enemies, and the mechanics that drive it all. Your primary weapon (as in Zelda) is a sword that is somewhat satisfying to use but is otherwise unremarkable. Your secondary weapon is a very strangely ineffective canon that fires weak, timed mortars that never go where you want them to. While you can get 'upgrades' that improve these weapons and that slightly alter their behavior, you're stuck with just these two. Meanwhile, in Zelda (and several other games you can draw comparisons to), you have a fairly broad array of secondary items to choose from.It's no wonder I couldn't be bothered to delve deeper. The foundation of Diehard Dungeon is simply not fun from the get-go. The dull art style does not help either. Overall, the game is just a chaotic mish-mash of genres and is unrewarding and uninspired. I say this because, while it can provide a good challenge, the game feels so average across-the-board that it is a very niche experience."

Using a controller is significantly better, and perhaps the way to go. if you dont have a controller, dont be encouraged to pick this up. if you dont a have an official controller (meanign the game doesnt detect it) google and download ""joy to key"" program, you can rebind your controller to make each button count as a specific key stroke.EDIT: I left the statement above to serve the purpose of showing that the developers do care for the game. the keys are now rebindable allowing for a custom configuration, which permits for a much confortable expeirnceThe game is hardcore roguelike, meaning it follows tipical standards of the genre. you only get 1 life, once its gone, you gotto start all over again. the game is going to be repetitive, however each time you learn something more, you improve, and the feeling of stepping into new heights is unique, and personally, very gratifying. I dont feel this game hits that feeling just yet, so far I have only dropped about 1 hour, so this learning feeling hasnt kicked in yet, maybe it wont.EDIT: after revisiting the game and passing it about twice, I can openly say that the experience has been enhanced while maintaining a good sense of difficulty, as some mechanics which made it a unfair for the player were polished and/or eliminated, EX: the sword swing delayThe combat is simple. your given a sword and a handcannon (think of it as a bomb launcher, meaning this ""bomb"" has a fuse on it. it wont explode on impact, it actually damages and bounces away from whatever is struck). the handcannon is unique in feel and learning how to work it out is solid.Edit: The sword on the other hand is the true meaning of ""mastering simplicity."" it is a basic horizontal swing forward, not much more/less, and perhaps is its simplicity that gives it its charm.This new style allows for a fresh feeling. some enemies make you weight the importance of your sword and its contrast with the cannon. while you can swing your sword much faster for much higher damage, your cannon allows for a safer aproach, and mixing but properly is what gives you a gratifying feeling of success.There is also a score attack called ""mayhem"", its strainght to the point a and you will play it once or twice for the sake of taking away the taste of a failed run, it helps to steam down very well.The asthetics of the game are ok. the music isnt spectacular, but gets the right feeling going, meaing its just fine.The game uses a pixel style meaning it feels like ""Legend of Zelda a Link to the Past"" nothing that will win an award, but a nice style considering the gameplay. fits nicely.Most discussed above can be disregarded almost entirely by personal taste though. The game can be picked and played quickly, specially for the low cost of the game itself and the simplistic gameplay, while still providing that roguelike feeling of ""learning through repeated failure.""If your looking for a hardcore Roguelike gamplay, ""the binding of isaac"" or ""our darker purpose"" will quench that thirst. but if your on the much more into quick and simple, this is a  better choice. the game is also getting updated, sentence that I hold strong.Nonetheless, if you have found great experience in games like rogue legacy, binding of isaac or risk of rain, this might come as a shorter burst of that flavorEdit: I would also like to make a strong sense of respect as my original review used to say that i didnt recommend this game, mostly on a bases that if 100 ppl played it, less that half would like it, (some original machanics, which are no longer there, made it difficult to enjoy properly).I stand chaged, most wont love it, but will play it, and few will learn to cherish it, enogh to comeback untill that 100% is there."

,Recommended,277870,12364147,"Posted: 4 October, 2014",all,Gentleman Death,"Well, this is an all new record for me.  I've played less than thirty minutes of this game and already love it.  As you know me (if you have read past reviews of mine) I am a frugal gamer.  Perhaps that should be my thing?  Anyway, this game went on sale recently for $2.24 and couldn't resist.  ""Zelda"" was in the description, so I threw my money at Steam.So, like I said I love it.  It'll probably get stale with time, but this is a great pickup-and-play-rogue-like adventure.  The way it plays reminds me a lot of ""Binding of Isaac"".  You go through various rooms picking up keys, hearts and power-ups.  Every so often you enter a room with a big-ol' boss baddy you have to defeat.  And just like ""Binding of Isaac"", the level layout is always changing so each time you die, the whole structure gets rearranged (thus my ""rogue-like"" description) and you lose your power-ups and have to start over again.  This makes each time you play a bit unique and different.  Any subtle hint of change always gives a game a bit more life to it so it doesn't become stale so easily.Now, I'm going to say this and I'm sure many people will disagree, but I like this much better than ""Binding of Isaac"" (Sorry to keep comparing it to that, but it's the only relation I know as far as style and I know MANY people have played ""BoI"").  The main, and probably sole reason, I like this more than ""BoI"" is that it is much more forgiving.  I'm not a great gamer, but I'm also no newbie. With that said, ""BoI"" is TOUGH for me.  Bosses are tough to get through, and when I make it I'm shocked and awed.  This does make it all the more rewarding, but like I mentioned before, when you die in ""BoI"", you lose everything and have to restart.  Needless to say, I die a lot in that game, become discouraged after ten minutes of play, and don't touch it for four months. With ""Diehard Dungeon"" I feel like I can make it pretty far without dying.  There's still a challenge, but I'm not getting slaughtered after only a handful of rooms.  I also feel like they're a little more generous with the power-ups, which makes this a little more rewarding and fun.Now, enough comparison.  Overall this game is addictive and makes me want to go deeper and deeper into this dungeon.  The style is very much in the vain of ""Link to the Past"" which is a lazy description I know, but it's the first thing that comes to mind.  It's got that heavy pixelated look which has become ever so popular.  As far as game play goes, yes it is like ""BoI"" (I swear that's the last time) BUT there are mini-games, too, with a global scoreboard, which definitely adds some replay value.  If you have just a bit of hardcore gamer in you, but also just want a casual game to play, this will be a perfect game to fulfill that need. A great edition to any gamers' Steam library."

Diehard Dungeon is one of the few that I really love.I'm not a fan of 8-bit style anymore, but it works well for this game. Sometimes the screen does get cluttered and you accidently step on a pressure plate, triggering a trap, but you learn how to watch out for things like that.You have a loot chest (like a mimic) who follows you around and collects the treasure, leveling up when it gains enough. At higher levels, the chest will gain ranged attacks and join you in fights. But there are also little imps who only attack the chest, and prevents the chest from collecting any loot while it's being chased around the room.The games difficulty adjusts with your success or failure, so you always get a suitable challenge. It took me 6 attempts before I first escaped the dungeon, and it unlocked optional champions who wander the edge of the dungeon on top of the walls and jump down to attack you... all while you are dealing with the regular room stuff like traps, monsters, etc.The game has a large variety of perks you can gain through a single dungeon delve and the ones you find are randomized. In one game, I gained the ability to hide in my loot chest, so monsters wouldn't be able to find me. Great if you need a breather and accidently bite off too many monsters at once. Other times I'm gained throwing knives, or flame resistance. All of them offer different ways to play the game, so it always keeps it fresh and interesting.Overall, I think this is the first rogue-like game in a long while with enough variety to keep me coming back time after time. Highly recommended."

It is a fun game but it can be pretty hard and the bosses are tough in my opinion.Main ReviewIn Diehard Dungeon you control a character that has a sword and a gun that shoots out bombs. The gameplay and controls feel very similar to an older Legend of Zelda game. There is even the spin attack. Each time you enter the dungeon you fight against random rooms of enemies. Eventually after clearing so many rooms you fight a boss. You do this about three times and then you fight the final boss. I think the gameplay is fun but it can get repetitive. Maybe I just suck but I rarely can beat this game. That being said I am trying to get to Diehard rank. This is like playing the game on very hard. The game has multiple challenge modes if the main game mode gets boring.The GoodThe game has lots of replayability.If you like being on lists then this game can scratch that itch for you.The badThe game does feel repetitive after so many plays.If you let the difficulty get too high without ever lowering it the game becomes very difficult.Final ThoughtsIf you like the look and feel of an older Legend of Zelda game, for example A Link to the Past and you like Rogue-Lite games then this game will be fun and I recommend it. That being said if somewhat repetitive dungeons and irritating enemies and bosses is a turn off then maybe you will not like this game. Like most indie games I would recommend watching some gameplay on Twitch/YouTube."

Quite a lot of different enemies. Some debuffs, which can't hurt you by itself, but if you happen to be debuffed while fighting...Also, there is Champion mode - game becomes harder, there is new enemies - souls of diehards, they have a nicknames of players, who completed the game at least once and choosed to be a bad or good guy. Good guys - help, bad guys - hurt, therefore you can a bit affect the playthroughs of other peoples, by choosing between these 2.The more succeseful you are at dungeoining, the higher you rank gets, the higher your rank - the harder game gets, like new monsters appear and stuff.Has leaderboard (tho I am not into that kind of things).Completing the game unlocks some new features, like perks and champion mode.

You cannot progress through this game unless you get insanely lucky with the chest loot, and even then, you are at the mercy of some new boss that's immune to knockback and impossible to dodge.I cannot reccomend this game.

,Recommended,277870,30021845,Posted: 18 February,all,DaemonVirus,"You enter a small hallway with a chest in the center of the room. You open the chest to find you have zero to three slot machine rolls which dictates what extra skills you may have when going in to the dungeon just beyond the door at the end of the hall. You approach the door and notice you seem to have a pet chest following you; picking up anything of value for you nearby. Determined to escape with your life, you enter the Diehard Dungeon.I've been meaning to review this game for some time now; I've been putting it off because I've wanted to complete all the achievements. Unfortunately, some of the achievements require a lot of grinding and good luck to get certain combinations of things in a level to even allow you to progress on these grinding achievements. Now, achievements don't make or break a game. They just provide goals to give reasons to play a game again and again even if the game isn't actually very good.Diehard Dungeon isn't a TERRIBLE game; it's good. Just... good. I don't find it to be a great game. I think part of that is because I'm a mouse-and-keyboard type of gamer and the controls seem to be a little better suited for a controller. So the controls seem to be a little bit clunky to me, but they're still workable. You're bound to have difficulties early on until you get the hang of things and then for the most part, you should be able to avoid everything and win nearly every time... depending on the items you get. At no point are you guaranteed to get an item. Every time to find a chest, you may get up to three rolls, or you may get zero. Once you find out how many rolls you get, it becomes like a jackpot machine. You have to match three of the same picture to get an item, but there's no skill to it at all; you get whatever the roll decides to give you. Then there are tokens that you randomly get throughout the game either by winning or picking up hearts when at full health, or by randomly being dropped during battle with the enemies.You have two options for combat; you may swing your sword which can be charged up for a circular attack, or you may shoot your gun which knocks enemies back, then explodes with another knock-back. The combat works, though in my opinion it can be a little dry. There are times when using your sword is obviously better, but using your gun is so much safer in nearly every situation so long as you're able to dodge properly. There are some traps on each floor which you have to avoid which are either pressure plates that shoot arrows or javelins at you, or spinning blades that randomly roam around the room (which sometimes also shoot arrows at you).This game isn't bad. I just don't think it's great. The achievements kept me playing longer than I had wanted to because I was determined to complete them all, but now I've lost interest and think it's time to move on. If you like rogue-like games, this one may interest you, but for me this game will be getting 6/10 for rogue-like games.Have a great day everybody! ^_^~ Kyle Welykholowa-- Check out my blog atwww.IntroNerdedLiving.blogspot.comfor more game reviews."

It's not as crazy as Nuclear Throne, it's not as overall good like Binding of Isaac, it doesn't have all that stuff to collect (or at least it doesn't seem to) like Rogue Legacy. There's only one playable character as far as I can tell, and he's not really all that charming to look at. But again, for 4.99, what can you ask for?If the game added more characters/classes, spruced up the environments a  bit. Add some sort of system to see (alliteration is fun, right?) permanent unlocks. Instead of, what seems to me after almost an hour of playing, collecting absolutely worthless ""treasure"" (some of which looks like it could be equippable like necklaces , etc), maybe have some function to the treasure, or at least explain what it is in the tutorial, since, afterall, there is a tutorial. If it added these things, I could see this game being a lot more replayable. As it stands now, I can't imagine having any fun at all with it if I were using mouse and keyboard, so I would definitely recommend a controller. Plus the rumble function makes it even better.I would definitely recommend this game for the current price, and if they add more meaningful content down the road, I'd recommend paying at least double the current price.

The fact that the coins and rings are in the game is just stupid, i was expecting there to be shops or equipable items (i know there are some, but they are rare and the benefit is hardly noticable or worth it).  Even the most simple thing like different weapons or gear to equip would have made this game more enjoyable, but there was little suspence in terms of finding new items for me.Again, i bought this for like a dollar so i guess it is worth the money, but compared to other roguelike games, there is little to no character progression that would make me want to play for hours and hours much like other games have (binding of issac, risk or rain, FTL etc) from somone who has hundreds of games on steam and is always looking for a great time killer i have to say there are way better options and this game will simply go in the folder of ""not bad but dont really want to play again"""

If you're going to copy Link to the Past's set up, at least use a good color pallet. Everything is brown and grey in the dungeons.2. The monsters are stock. Slimes, bandits, mimicks, and... fat guys. I dunno what they're supposed to be. The bosses are lame. Giant fat guy. Guy who's head pops off and floats around. A shy guy from Mario. A mimick. Meh! The only advantage they have over you, the only way they ever damaged me, was with teleporting or simply because they were running faster than me. Lame.3. The items and power-ups suck. Your sword reaches a quarter of an inch and your gun shoots blueberries instead of, y'know, bullets. So your projectiles bounce off everything and rarely connect for full damage. The power-ups include lame things like status immunities, larger health pools, and the ability to run faster. Where's all my exotic weapons? Damage shields? Dashing? ANYTHING fun?4. Many enemies either run from you, slow you down, or are faster than you-- making every single one tedious.5. Crates can contain explosives and/or enemies that hit you as soon as they pop out. Chance rules over skill.TDLR:I know this is a rogue-like, but the power-ups and enemies are dumb. The setting/dungeon is UGLY. The difficulty is artificial, where chance rules over skill."

I bought Diehard Dungeon while it was on offer, the reviews warned that it was like a very hard Zelda style dungeon slasher. When it said hard, I didn't expect it to be AS hard as it is. Part of me is glad I didn't pay a lot for this game. For the simple fact, it's not suited for the casual gamer. If like me, you play games to relax and have an hour of enjoyment, Diehard Dungeon will leave you ever so slightly frustrated.My hat is off to the developers, it's a lovely thought out game and really looks like something you'd see on the SNES, but thats about all it does do. DD feels like it only caters toward a certain type of gamer. Those who dont mind repeating the same motions over and over again. Frankly I got bored very quickly of dying and loosing everything I had achieved. What is the point of a retry, if you dont continue from were you left off?I was really looking forward to some old skool style gaming and for the first 2-3 minutes DD felt like it actually would come up with the goods. Then as I played more, disappointment set in as I realised thats not what this game offers.  Games should leave the player feeling they have a fair chance at winning and I dont get that feeling from DD.

Within 10 to 20 minutes you'll ""get it"" and within 2 hours you'll beat it. At that point you'll either want more or be done. $5 for 2-3 hours of entertainment with the possibility of much more isn't so bad.For the most part, what's new in this game isn't fun and what's fun in this game isn't new. It's still very enjoyable, but it will be very familiar. Unlike many dungeon crawler games with this camera angle, you have a gun! It shoots cannonballs that explode, dealing more damage. It's supposedly a skill-based projectile, but in reality you just fire it directly at the enemy because all the enemies AI is ""walk towards you"" or ""walk towards you, run away when you get near"" or ""run around like a chicken with its head cut off"". I feel that it would have been more fun to use the projectile if the AI took a bit more thought to outsmart; most rooms can be flawlessly cleared by standing in a corner and shooting your cannon over and over until you kill things off screen, doubly so with upgrades.The upgrades are sensible and fun and your playthroughs are basically determined by them. If you get good ones (see: relating to ranged attacks) you'll win easily, if you get bad ones you'll have to make smart choices to win. It is fun to get ugprades and change your play based on how you get them, but its mostly just more effective versions of the same thing.That said, it's a fun game that actually gets harder the more you play it. If you REALLY enjoy this type of game, you can keep playing and it will get harder and harder. Get frustrated from losing? The game gets easier. It's a good system, although it's kinda ""meh"" in its implementation; I beat the game at the ""warrior"" level, which is the 3rd level in the chain. There's many more levels and I'd imagine the game is way more fun at those levels, but it doesn't allow for it without extensive playtime, so I guess I'll never see it.This is a pick up and play when you've got 30 minutes to play a game or don't want to get invested in a long term committment.

You also get a ranged bomb attack that you shoot out of a cannon. You progress from room to room, always forward through the dungeon, with each room needing some basic goal to be completed: kill certain enemies, unlock a lock, or press some buttons. Sometimes there are secret rooms you can go to instead! What each room contains is random, I'm not sure if it is many stock rooms, or procedually generated, or a mixture, but the variety seems good enough. After a certain amount of rooms, you come to a boss, and there seems to be quite a few you can possibly encounter. The title should say it well enough, but it is also a challenging game!There are powerups to collect, all I've seen so far are passive benefits like immunity to status effects, or better attacks. My favorite so far lets you shoot 3 bombs at once. There is also gold/jewels to collect, which apparently levels up the treasure chest that follows you around? I'm not fully sure what the deal is with that, but it seems like a friendly sentient treasure chest, so it's fun. :DThere are also some little minigames you come across during the adventure, and also some you can play from the main menu. These little extras are great and nice little breaks from the standard. One on the main menu is locked needing tokens to unlock, which can be collected through multiple playthroughs, but the tokens are also useful in the dungeon for various things.I should also mention that the game simply 'feels' right. I'm not sure how better to put it, but I think anyone reading this review have played enough games to maybe understand me... there are many an indie game that looks cool but when you play there is just something(s) missing that you can't put your finger on that the game lacks in it's polish to really make it sing.

I'm sure I don't have to explain what you do but basically you get a chest companion who picks up your loot for you while you run around mashing x and somethings hitting right trigger then x to shoot a blueberry-canon type projectile.It has random powere ups you get from chests randomly placed throughout the maps, except for the chest you get from the very beginning. My only problem with this system is that the chests act like a slot machine and don't guarantee you anything, which is annoying. I'd rather just open a chest and get a piece of gold rather than wait there and watch the reels whirl to reveal I get nothing from tche chest.There's no guard or parry button, which is a little disappointing but not really that big of a deal. Anyone who can beat this game without that definitely has my respect, because this game is pretty challenging.I don't understand the canon to well but I'm starting to get use to it. It doesn't explode on impact and it doesn't hurt you however it sends out a blast radius that supposedly hurts enemies and pushes you around, which is kind of annoying to be honest. I hate it but when my health gets low I tend to spam it to keep myself from dieing.One last thing that bothers me is some of the achievements are for getting abilities, which are randomly rewarded to you. I don't like that because you could theoretically play for longer than this game is fun and not get the achievement for getting some random ability. Not really a big deal, but I figured some people would be deterred by that if they were achievement hunters.I hope this doesn't look to negative, because this game is actually quite fun to play. Plus it has mini games, which I haven't unlocked all of but that little extra is pretty amazing.

Weapon choices are limited, because it's not like the prestigious Binding of Isaac with all of its weapons in which change how the game goes dramatically. Instead, it nods to previous games such a Zelda. A rogue-like doesn't need all of that to be good. All it needs is this sense of difficulty in which attracts an individual and makes them want to play over and over again. Graphics.... They have little to do with this review, but I would say they meet the standard for what is needed to be a decent rogue-like. Just like Binding of Isaac, Pixel Piracy, or Paranautical activity it has its own unique feeling which is unique to this game.  In conclusion I find this game to be wonderful. 8/10.

Monsters does get stronger.Experience/ranking system is useless.Controls are sometimes very clunky.Has some different game modes.Doesn't really have the ""catchy-Play""Other things.The game partially reminds me of Legend of Zelda.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10"

Last time I had ""I need to get home fast from work to play feeling"" was as I were playing The binding of Isaac.This game provides hours of fun, and challenging moments!And for once - Don't try to look after a wiki and just play it as it is; Yea you might die a couple of times but it's part of the game :) there's a lovely detail on the graphics that makes you feel home if you're into the bit'ish games ;) and the song creates a good ambience for your current area (My favorite is the boss ost).There is however one minor issue I would like to adress, and that is the lack of community :( I got stuck at a boss and after the 5'th death I tried to look him up, but with no luck. I then tried to look around the steam community of the game to find any minor guides or something like that but no luck either, so I had to figure it out my self (hit and run was the answer._.')But overall a really well performed and challenging game!it's a steady 8/10 from me :)"

It's as diehard as they come. Every time you start things up, you're off on a new adventure because each level is randomly generated. On top of that, you only have one life. If you run out of hearts, that's it. So if you like a challenge, and don't like having your hand held, this game is it!GRAPHICSIf you enjoy SNES-style action RPG graphics, then you'll love this. And while it's clearly inspired by pixel sprites, this scales well on bigger monitors and HDTVs.SOUNDThe music is atmospheric and pairs well with the dungeon atmosphere. The sound effects also give you a sense that you're in a wet dingy place.CONTROLSWorks great whether with a keyboard or a Steam controller. I perfer the controller, of course, because it makes for a more authentic experience. Best thing about the controls is that it's ultra precise with both sword and guns.HARDWAREThis is a adaptable on all sorts of hardware that runs Windows 10. It works on my HP Stream 11 running a Celeron dual core N3050 with integrated Intel graphics. It also runs on my Gigabyte BRIX gaming PC running an AMD A8 quad core with a Radeon R9 graphics card.OVERALL8.5/10.

I'm only about an hour and 10 minutes into the game at the time of writing this, but I can honestly say I'm enjoying this far more than Binding of Isaac.Positives+Graphics are pixelated, many people get upset by this but honestly it fits the game and doesn't bother me.+Minigames on certain chests, that are actually kind of fun so far. The one I have seen (I know there are more) is a pacman like one. (There is a seperate minigame menu that leads to different minigames, one of which is akin to Geometry Wars/Asteroids but with a theme that matches the game)+Controls are easy to learn, and offers controller support for at the least XBox 360 controllers (have not tested ps3, ps4, XBox One, etc)+Two weapon types that I have seen thus far, a sword that controls similarly to Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES, and a sort of grenade launcher with bombs that bounce off walls and enemies (takes some getting used to, but once one gets the hang of it, it becomes very useful).+The game actually has a tutorial as opposed to a one room picture of ""lol space is bombs and left stick moves while right stick shoots, good luck out there!""+You can change the color of your character's clothing (Yeah, I consider this a positive. What of it?)+You start with a companion chest which stores treasure for you. When you collect enough, the chest will upgrade and eventually start defending you and fighting back. Chest gets stronger with each level, naturally.+If you have collected 10 golden keys throughout your run, you can open a special chest and receive a ""perk"" which will carry through to the next game (I think this is how it works, anyways.) This was one thing I didn't like about Binding of Isaac, not one thing carried over no matter how good the run was or how much effort you put into it; all you could do was unlock new things.+Very reasonable price, I got it on sale for $1 and some loose change, and after playing it can honestly say I'd have paid for the full price and still felt good about my purchase.+Tokens go into token wells, which will give you money/health/items. Any un-spent tokens will carry over into the next game.Negatives-Hitboxes can sometimes be janky-In the tutorial area, there were chests on top of the walls. Maybe there is a secret way to get to them, or it was a one time bug on my end; but either way I felt this should be noted. However, there have been no other issues with wall-chests after tutorial.-The sword isn't particularly useful past smashing crates or hitting switches, unless you get some upgrades for it. Most of the time, you will end up spamming your cannon.All in all, I feel this is a very good game for a very good price. Now I'm off to get another hour or two into it!"

The second play session I totally caught the motion of this game and made it completely through the dungeon, don't forget to look hard for those gold keys so you don't fall short of the 10 key chest. Completed dungeon runs reward you with perks for your perks, for example the first time through you recieve a perk to recieve a random perk after starting a run after another run. The atmosphere is lit well enough and creepy, giving a sense that you really don't know how to get out. Each floor has a choice to go towards harder or easier rooms. The game is hard, most likely for replay value like The Binding of Isaac, don't let that discourage you too much though. All in all, good game for a loot based dungeon crawler."

Diehard Dungeon is one of those quick consumables that doesn't leave you wishing you just had your main course instead. A fantastic, admittedly short, roguelite with all the elements you need for repeat playthroughs.What I believe to be one of the greatest things about Diehard Dungeon is that it's really not inteded for your more ""extreme"" Roguelike audiance, and is heavily pushing to the Roguelite gameplay.. while, at the same time, still appealing to that ""harsher audience"" due to the game's initial appeared difficulty."
