I bought the game just assuming i could run it (didnt look very system heavy) but my graphics card is not compatible. Not really the developers fault i didnt read the reccomended requirements which is why i am not downvoting and the game from what i have seen does show a lot of potential and i hope that as they develop the game more they will optimize it and make it easier to run for those of us with older computers!
76561198155066157,Recommended,277930,14333743,"Posted: 4 February, 2015",all,DooyDan,"Firstly, I would like to applaud the developers at Nerd Kingdom on a great job in developing a terrific game so far.  It must be, I’ve logged over 900 hours since purchasing the game in September 2014. Apparently, I don’t have a life.  To put this into perspective, that’s about 6 hours of game playing per day over the past five months.Like most people, I enjoy playing open world sandbox survival games, exploring, crafting, mining, but mostly building things.  TUG offers all of these things, but with a very rich non-blocky interactive environment where you become immersed into your surroundings. The world ambient sounds seem to add to this immersion, leading you to start foraging for supplies right away to survive at least the first night.  The environment sounds have you looking over your shoulder for critters that might be sneaking up on you or a sound that stops you in your tracks wondering what is that?, is it going to eat me?, do I run away?Once you start the game, you immediately find yourself exploring or running away from a critter because you haven’t crafted a weapon yet and thinking that the rock in your hand doesn’t seem adequate enough to defend yourself, or just wanting to see what is over the next hill or to watch a spectacular sunrise or sunset.  Once you feel safe you notice that you are now hungry so you begin foraging for food to eat.  My mom always wanted me to be a vegetarian.  You now notice that your backpack of many things is full containing mostly different types of rocks, a few sticks and some vines. You begin throwing these items onto the ground to see what can be crafted. Now that you are armed to the teeth with stone tools and weapons; including a hoe and shovel, you are more likely to begin building something such as a hole in the ground to hide in or experimenting with the various available building materials (limited at the moment) to construct your dream home-base to venture forth from into the world of TUG.One thing I like about TUG so far is that there are no zombies, yet.  I don’t like zombies as they sneak-up on you while you are busy doing something and scare the ___ out of you, much like the forest children do in this game, the kinokojin.Although I have experienced many game crashes mostly with the indev version, lost files, and other game bugs, TUG is still a great game so far and knowing it will get even better with future updates.Putting all that aside, the following are some suggestions that would be nice to see implemented into the game; however, some of these suggestions may not be possible:1.	Crafting a compass. This is not really necessary, but crafting a compass would be a cool way to explore the world of TUG for those who need one.  Based on your compass marches or hikes, you could craft area maps.  I found that knowing where the sun rises and sets in the game (east and west) and using landmarks, whether made or natural, you can navigate throughout the world quite reasonably.2.	Crafting a bow and arrows.3.	The gathering and or crafting of new building materials.4.	Doors, windows and furniture.5.	Adding a smaller block size in addition to the two we already have for adding building trim details.6.	Once water is introduced into the game, will seedlings be able to swim?7.	Crafting a boat to float down that lazy river or to see if you can survive boating over a waterfall or white water rafting.8.	Crafting a fishing rod to go fishing on that hot sunny afternoon.  Crafting different types of lures or using different types of bait to attract different types of fish would be cool.  Fishing could also be dependent on the time of day and the weather.9.	Climbing trees to get away from predators when all you have is a rock in your hand to defend yourself.  The only problem with this type of defence is that the predator will not go away and you will eventually starve to death sitting in the tree, unless you can eat the tree leaves. Picture the scene from the Movie ‘Quest for Fire’.10.	Throw rocks, especially at tigers and the forest children.11.	Pets, a dog like creature, horse or riding type creature.12.	Other wildlife critters to hunt or to just watch, such as ungulates, birds and predator type creatures.13.	Different mystical biome creatures, one for each type of biome.14.	More world ambient sounds, such as a hooting owl in the haunted forest biome, howling critters when the moon rises, etc.15.	Weather systems such as rain, snow, thunder storms, tornados, etc.16.	More uses for critter hides other than leather strips.17.	Crafting implements of destruction such as a trebuchet or canon to silent that noisy forest child, just kidding.In closing, all I can say about TUG is that it is an awesome game so far and has the potential of being one of the best open world sandbox survival games presently being developed.All the best to the developers at Nerd Kingdom and keep up the great work."

,Not Recommended,277930,20942815,"Posted: 3 February, 2016",all,Kailian,"I would like to state right off the bat, that I do not hate this game at all. I was actually going to purchase a copy of the game for my wife today to play it together, found out it had been taken off the store, and read the AMA and related info.This is a complicated game to review, but I felt I would share my thoughts so far. This game has has a lot of heart and love put into it so far, it's very obvious when playing it. It has a very immersive feel as well, via placing objects on the ground, instead of storing hordes of trash in numerous boxes. The feeling of digging out a mine, and having to dump the rock and dirt out the hole, is simple, but adds to that immersion. I also love the sound and effects at night time; That eerie wind and ambience is just mind blowing. Every update to this game, I update and play, as they had been adding tons of unique content.However, I have to put emphasis on ""had."" They did work on new biome generation and terrain generation as of last year, which was a big task to do, but there wasn't much else added in. They had a good reputation for releasing small, but potent updates to the game frequently, and highlighting them on their youtube channel, which I would reccomend following if you're at all interested in the game. The youtube channel itself describes what I'm talking about. A lof of the updates come slower than the last, and several of the ""in the works"" projects being worked on never saw the light of day.  The last major update involved adding a crafting journal, which was great, but those changes were far too small in the scope of what was supposed to be there. It was disappointing to constantly wait to see changes to this game, only to try it out again in a few months, and being disappointed, or bored after a couple hours. It just feels too ""barren"" for a game that has been in EA this long.I felt like the game had an amazing direction, of molding your ""seed"" and it's appearance, which reminded me of Fable in a way. This awesome feeling of exploring a survival world, with less focus  on survival, and more on exploring and progression in a sense and the players making their own ""game"" in a sense, by offering a diverse solid universe. It seems, and I may be wrong, that they focus more and more on the ""pvp"" community and pvp in general, rather than coop survival, which seemed like the original spirit of the game. This news comes on the heels of their announcment to make the game F2P, and nothing good rarely comes from a F2P model. While I have no doubt that they will do their best to make it a fair F2P model, if that is the route they choose, it doesn't seem like an idea that makes a whole ton of sense to me.That being said, the devs are a great team of people, and I have a huge amount of respect for their vision for this game, and have given it nothing but praise up until this point. They are very active in discussions about it, and interacting with the community.I still have the best hopes for this game, and look forward to the final product. I still am in love with that original trailer, and what I imagined it could be. Even in it's current form, it is a good game, to be perfectly fair. In some senses, I don't feel the devs give themselves enough credit, and are too worried about failing. We just need to see content that changes the game, and adds to it drastically. More pets, more mounts, more weapons and armors, more enemies, boss monsters, and places to explore and learn more about the interesting story they've put behind this game. It should also go without mention to how amazing the art is for TUG.The end note I guess is, that it's great they want to work in a new engine for the game, in a way. But it's a risky move, as we've seen what can happen with games like DayZ, wanting to 'redo' the entire game to make it better. I will still check out the updates from time to time, but it's sad to see that they almost seem to be damaging the game by taking it off the market, instead of trying to promote it more. I know these devs are a small team, and very talented, with a work load far above their numbers, but this just seems like a baffling move. I only wanted to write this because I had a lot of hope for this game. I wasn't a KS backer, but I did buy into EA very shortly after it came out on Steam.TL;DR Wait until the finished product comes out, and see what they have. (Not that you have a choice now, at least for a year.) If things change for the better, and there's actually content that keeps me invested, my review would change to a positive in a second."

First you future-buy stuff EA, to support the newcomers and their good ideas. A load of it never proceed or pretty slow like TUG. Then they change it to F2P, so the income keeps going (instead of hurry and start the next project, like big companies, because they already got their money) and then, IF they complete it, TUG will become what... monthly payment and with real-cash-store? Pay-to-achieve-anything?What was the kickstarter AND the EA for? Raising a budget to make a game, I thougt so at least.

Its not because my view of the game in its current state has changed. It's because my view of the development of the game has. If you are into crafting/survival/creative/adventure game I feel this is worth following and here is why. The developers are creating the games engine with a set of easily accessible tools the will enable gamers to easily become modders. They are not just trying to make a game they are trying to build a community of modders that can easily create their own material. I very much respect this view and am excited to see what they come up with. So why should I believe what the developers say?, after all we live in a time EA fever and so many fail to deliver on their grand claims. Well the only reason I have any faith in this company is the willingness of the devs to ""throw themselves to the wolfs"" so to speak. Any developer that can't or isn't able to deliver usually slowly stops the updating then kind of fades away to rarely be herd from until the game is released with a slimey Plop!. These guys seem to be continuously prodding the community for involvement even when the reactions are hostile!. They have not faded out into the background but seem to be very open about what their goals are as far as development of the game. To me they are holding firm on their vision. Will it work out? IDK! It really depends on how good of a game TUG is when it is released. If it still sucks then no one will want to play it. If no one is playing it then nobody will want to mod for it no matter how good the tools are. If they really put in the effort to create a solid well thought out game then it has a chance. These in my mind are good reasons to keep an eye on this game.Totally Unfinished Garbage. Even the devs recommend not playing this game. That is why they don’t sell it anymore. It’s so bad they are considering just giving it away. Even if it does go F2P it would not be worth the download in its current state. NK still hasn’t even come up with a business model for this game even after putting it up for sale on steam. According to the developers they “still have years + time"" before they come up with a decision on how to distribute this game. Now we are all aware of the risks of making the choice to support early access but wishy washy nonsense is what truly drives EA supporters’ nuts. hopefully Nerd Kingdom and the rest of the world can learn from this train wreck and move on. However if NK make the game better and come up with a real business plan in their ""Years+ time"" I will definitely change my review."
76561197999776702,Recommended,277930,13092425,"Posted: 26 November, 2014",all,CantShootCrap,"So here is how my experience has been so far. When I started the game, I first spawned in the desert. I had no clue what to do next. Some of the rocks were obvious they could be picked up and used and I liked when you hovered over it , you got a description. I had no clue what to do, there was no food, no trees. I think at some point of running around and not sure what to do, I went out of the game and tried to get some tips what to do, like what I could eat. Not much in the desert except the cactus, then I ran into a pumkin or the goard and ate those too.So I took off running ( after I learned how to run )  and kept going till I got into the forest. Yay!!! trees and more food. Of course I heard those little fairies or sprites, cool sound effects but wasn't sure what to do. ( At some point in my adventure I chased one down with my sword and killed it only to have it turn mushroom chunks- is that it? ) I started wacking things with my stones till I got a tree down, and then tried a bunch of random things to see if I could craft something. Nope, I'm too dumb, so back out to the web to see what I missed. Again Yaa!, I only looked till I could see some of the basics- didn't want to spoil it too much. So back in the game I went.I started gathering food, hunted some goats and got some meat and some hides, planting crops, building my shelter. ( What no doors, windows, bars no protection? If this was minecraft I would be toast. What if the tiger comes snooping around? Yes I saw a couple and even killed one with a spear. At this point in the game they seem to be easy ) Crap I can't make a fire and I can't make a bed. Back out to Steams discussion board to look up tips again. ( really could use in game references and tips ). So back in the game. Still other than stone I haven't started mining yet. A couple times I started to explore and I got lost, had to create some large stone pillars as a guide to get back. Okay now there are more things I want to craft and I can't remember how. Back out to the discussion board to look things up. (Awsome video tutorials BTW.. thanks for those Skaduush)  I was thinking it would be easier going back out to the desert for mining. Okay where was the desert again??  More big pillars to lead me back home. I also learned from the videos I just have to dig down deep to mine. At least I can stay aroung my base camp for now.Okay I learned a few more things on the main site. I am ready to craft more things and now start mining. See how good my memory is before I go back out to figure out the rest of the crafting.I can deal with the game getting laggy after playing long periods. I can deal with some glitchy AI with the goats and tigers ( right now that seeems to be it ) who on occasion will merge with their environment or run in place ( go around things you silly animals, go around ) I might need more protagonists in this game, keep it challenging. The game has a prehistoric type feel to it, can we add dinosaurs?? Pretty please? Can I tame and ride one? What does the blue gem on my hand do? So many questions. How about laddders and bridges for being up in the trees. Some looked huge where you cannot cut them down, perfect for a treehouse.I think once I am the master of my domain, I am gong to stock up on supplies and just head out exploring. ( Still haven't figured out how to make the backpack I crafted work so I can store more, the default inventory is small- unless you want to carry rocks, seems you can carry alot of cobblestone )Oh and don't be surprised if you go to look at your seed ( character ) and you change sex and size..haha  I was trying to make myself all muscular ( read if I carry heave loads my character will get bigger. I seeemed to be at a young man/boy stage, but when I jumped back in the game I was a young girl..funny.At this point I am keeping my thumbs up as far as my review. Things are going good. I am learning the game, not finding too many faults. I do hope with some of the upcoming updates I can get an idea where the game is going."

I have not given further attention to this game and cannot update the review.  I'm avoiding deleting this review for the sake of maintaining a historical perspective, but to be fair to the game and the developer, please skip this review and see something more recent.While TUG seems to have some good ideas, I cannot recommend itat this point.  It shows promise and may be worth taking a look at later on in development.BuildingThere really isn't a whole lot to do at this point.  You can build, though there doesn't seem to be a wide range of blocks available just yet.Also, while the texture blending on placed blocks is very nice in most cases, I'm not sure how suitable it is when building a house (ex: grass blending with wood or wood blending with cobblestone wall).In my opinion, some of the tools should work a little bit faster.  Ex: digging up an area can be long and tedious.HuntingI've only seen two different sorts of mob so far, though there's supposed to be a third (some manner of predatory cat?).  The giggles/growls of the little mushroom imp are irritating.CraftingIMPORTANT:Software should almost never make choices for the user.  In order to craft, we must throw our ingredients on the ground and press G.  If the ingredients match any recipe, the item will be crafted.  If the ingredients match multiple recipes, a random item will be crafted.No!  Just, no!Take an example where I want to build two spears.  I gather two shafts, two spear heads, and some vines, toss them on the floor, and hit G.  Oops... I forgot that the vine wall takes two shafts and some vines... Instead, when there are multiple recipes available, pop up a small dialog which lists the available options.  For any recipe that is unknown to the player (ie: player has never crafted it), provide the option with an ""Unknown Recipe"" label.I'm a little worried that the current crafting implementation will result in a glut of crafting components.  Compare to Minecraft where a grid defines the resulting item.  Without the grid (or without the option above), we need to have specific items in order to decide what the recipe will result in as can be seen with the multiple tool heads that are required right now (axe, pick, hammer, sword).  With a grid or the above method, we could simplify the recipe to ""a handle + a stone"".  This means players need less storage space (ie: chests).Items which are not implemented probably should have their recipe disabled.  I was disappointed to craft the leaf backpack and find that it does nothing.  I was about to craft a chest and read that it wasn't implemented either.Inventory/Hotbar-thingI find the inventory to be woefully small, but I understand that the character we're playing is a child with a tiny backpack.  This could possibly be mitigated by bumping up stack sizes for some things (ie: I believe wooden shafts have a stack size of 2...?  That seems fairly low)I imagine those spaces at the bottom are some sort of hotbar, so I was frustrated to find that items get shuffled around and don't just stay put.  In my mind, if I set items in a specific order in my hotbar, they should always be in that order.Side-note/Request: I find the sound effect that gets played when the ""TUG"" splash is displayed during game load to be a little bit on the louder side.  Would be nice if that could get toned down a bit or follow configured volume settings."

This game seems promising, but I see no reason to suggest that anyone drop $20 on it right now.As of 8 October 2015, what you will get for your investment will amount to, perhaps, 20 hours of play time. The art style is great. The overall feel is pleasant. The game is more or less playable, though you hit something of a brick wall in terms of progression very quickly. There is no music, so the ambient wind sound tends to make the game feel very eerie. You will probably fall through the map a few times.

So I might as well throw them in here:We were promised a whole innovative new crafting system (by throwing things on the ground / on crafting thingies)We get a NPC trading system and a fixed crafting machine.We were promised a voxel manipulation and build system. (to build as we like)We get a system where you mine regenerating (?) resources in fixed places and then craft (in machine mentioned above) that into ready made house parts which only can placed in designated areas.We were promised to begin playing from stone age one (and make your way up eventually as the game progresses in development)We get something complete different ... with maybe, possibly, if we are lucky, the stone age portion comes back as some NPCs. But only if we complain a lot.We were promised a procedural ""endless"" world.We get a rather small handcrafted one.Another example of what the game once was ... which is a polar opposite where it is heading now (from the yogscast ...which I had to make into a new playlist because steam thinks to have detected a swearword):https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_YWepJ1ErP31wmx4DTycX_-EU4mcOkHb(one video of the playlist as example)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH3bPHvCPJM&t=1m22sThat is almost as as bad as (and that only as analogy) promising a adventure game and delivering an first person shooter (or the other way round)I for my part want my money back."

They've gone from a cartoony art style to a more realistic one but they're a bit ugly. So it's not ""gorgeous"" like I claim.A developer has assured me on their forums that the current graphics are only temporary. They shared footage of how it should look in a few months time and it will look awesome again.Gameplay-wise it's still much the same game but with some good new stuff. Traps are particularly cool.Original Review (Dec 2014)I'm so in love with the developer's plans for this game. Six minutes into one youtube video and I was sold on it.Like just the fact that you craft items by placing them on the ground, or in some cases on a crafting workspace, rather than it all happening in your inventory is charming. It's hardly revolutionary but design features like this (and future ones) are all oriented at providing a more immersive in-the-game rather than in-the-ui experience.At the moment it's slightly bare. You can build well enough and the crafting and farming systems are good. The game looks gorgeous. If you enjoy games like minecraft just for the pleasure of building then you could already get a lot of satsifaction out of this game. Otherwise you might to hold off a little. The devs say multiplayer should arrive soon. And presently you can't customise your character at all. It just randomly changes every time you load the same game. Bit weird that. But their ultimate plans for character appearance customisation are very interesting.So I'm very happy to recommend the game but it may not be for everyone in its current state."

I thought I'd take a shot at buying it.The first warning was when my usual PC wouldn't run it, despite it having no problem with things like Skyrim, bioshock infinite and other AAA titles. The game, it turns out, requires DX11, and a 2Gb graphics card, along with a whole host of other outlandish features just to run. That is, if you're missing any of those, it won't run slower, it just won't run at all. The recommended settings are even higher. My higher end PC doen't have the 3Gb graphics card it recommends, but at least it'd run.After this, I figured this must be a pretty incredible game to have such lofty requirements. I mean, I know it's early access, but they must be doing something with all these requirements, right?Starting it up, I can't describe how disappointing it is. This looks like a unity game someone game up with in a weekend. The graphics do not look good, for any stage of development. This looks absurdly bad.The really worrying thing is that this looks like the developers have an engine and are making a game in it, which is fine for an indie game, but it isn't fine when they are devouring resources like this. The state of the game doesn't give a lot of hope they are going to be able to optimise this to run on lower spec machines once there's something worthwhile actually there.I hope I'm proved wrong, and this becomes the sort of game it looks like it could be, but right now it feels like Yogventures part II. A developer that has lofty goals, a partnership with Yogscast, and an overreaching ambition it can't match.If you want a game like this to work, maybe take a lesson from minecraft, and focus on getting things to work mechanically before requiring a computer of the gods to run it."

It is rough and very buggy but that is to be expected with something still in the early stages. I played for as long as I could stand to, It shows great promise once they refine it and work out the many thousands of bugs.At it's current level of development it is practically unplayable in any entertaining way. I can craft anything without harvesting resources, I can dig endlessly without even moving since aparently I have the world's longest arms. This game would benefit from a plot and campaign storyline to explain what you are and give you tasks to accomplish as a kind of tutorial.Overall right now this game is a 3/10 with potential to be much more.

Once again we find ourselves here. A promising game, promising the world, slowing and then stalling in development which I can only assume comes about due to one of two things management of the money or capability of the developers to produce, take your pick (Same with all failed kickstarter/ea/whatever bs to grab some cash fotm scheme). We now find ourselves in a very familiar ""considering f2p"" and reboot/redesigning/starting from scratch with a new engine situation which will no doubt result in an extended period of no meaningful development.Shame.

It crashes, its poorly optimised and the keybindings/controls are an obstacle to actually playing, Saying that, its easy to see its going to be fun when finished.Its atmospheric, has an original crafting system and stylish looks when its stable and working.Currently there is no multiplayer and any implementation of pvp. (next patch apparently) On top of this, just in the news it was announced that half the team has been made redundant. (apparently a deal fell thro, but they had a big team for an indie dev)Seeing past the rough edges you can glimpse a gem in the working. As long as development continues I have no problem recommending this for its current price of approx £6. Time will tell.Important note - The current price is about to triple when the next patch arrives so now would be a good time to invest for a decent future title.  To be fair unlike a lot of early access games I think this was fairly priced for its current state. When the price does rise I will re-evaluate.Kherny."

Don't buy TUG yet, it's just not that far along.On the other hand, do you want to talk with the developers about how things might workbeforethey're added? Do you wonder whether people play games differently when game mechanics change? Do you just like discussing what you love about gaming? Then maybe you'll enjoy owning TUG alpha. (I'm having a blast!)Don't get me wrong, you will be able to play around in TUG. You can spend a few hours fighting friends, playing around with what harvesting and crafting is there, or building a huge base in creative mode. You can mod many aspects of the game, make fan objects, art. or textures, put up YouTube tutorials, and watch the occasional livestreams. But as of this writing, much of the gameplay just isn't there yet. That is just the way Alphas work.Early access development is pretty active: updates don't happen frequently, but every new release includes large changes, and several brand new types of gameplay. (Version 0.8.5 added the first version of aging and body morphing, completely revamped how the sky looks and works, and added some new clothing and building material recipes.)So, before you buy, check out the game forumshere, watch TUG'sIn The Worksvideos, read through the kickstarter update postshere. Do the features currently in place sound fun? Are you inspired by the vision and possibilities? Are you itching to talk about the ways you love to play?Thendecide whether it's too early to pay for."

I continously support the game developers behind a project of this scale. Anyone who hopes for a ""finished"" product should ignore this game for quite some time. The developers released this game very early to the public in hopes to work along with the playerbase. Unlike most people who chose to buy this game, I bought it specifically for this matter, to give them feedback rather than to play it once, write a hateful review, and call it a scam.First off, let me tell you that in no way at all has this game been abandoned. They have been working behind the scenes on their new engine to dropkick DirectX 11, and welcome OpenGL for a much larger audience to enjoy. So far it has been pretty vague, but recently Inoritewtf (Developer) has released an EXTREMELY EARLY tech video of the new engine in the works that you can see here ->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpk-B7L5SE(Not even sure if I'm allowed to show that). So far it's not much, but give it some time (A long time) and it may be pretty amazing. As for the release of version 2.0, don't expect it to release anytime soon, my best guess is late 2017/ early 2018 but don't rely on that since i'm not a developer.Now it's time for some things I was not impressed with. Although I do like this game and the modding possibilities it has, I was not impressed with the gameplay elements. Part of it seemed good, but when several updates were cranked out, it all seemed a bit rushed with a poor look into what would become of that particular feature.This community just needs to calm down a bit and hold onto their socks for a little while longer. When this new version is out, It will more than likely be a completely different experience, but for now we must deal with this Pre-Alpha version for quite some time. That's all I have to say for now, I will update this review once we are closer to release."

The engine has great potential and I personally haven't found anything ""broken"" or unplayable about it. You simply do everything that can be done and then you don't have much else but exploration and repeating crafting, taming, and resource get. The biggest problems are that the team hasn't been keeping in touch with the community and we haven't seen an update in several moons. I keep looking up their forums and still nothing. The last that was stated was they were updating to a 2.0 (versions are arbitrary so effall on that) but that probably means bumping up the technology to keep up with current-gen graphics and physics and it might be free. If they do make it free, good. I helped them make it happen. I'm not like all the extra nerds who felt like they didn't even get a game. It is a game... just a very short one and I'm used to waiting a year for updates on some of my favorite titles, so I get updates for one game each month and that keeps me busy and helps me enjoy each title more without distraction."

It is meant to be played with...or against friends...and it does have a steep, and I really do mean steep learning curve. Getting started and crafting useful items is your first main challenge. Crafting in this game is not done on a grid as in most survival/crafting games... instead, you lay the items you want to try combining on a flat surface such as a rock slab and press G on the crafting surface. If the items combine to make something, you will see a crafting bar and then the resulting item afterwards. Take my word on this however...play around and figure out what to combine to make what on your own, don't cheat and look up the crafting recipes. The sense of acomplishment from discovering what makes what is part of the fun. This game has a way of making you feel like a cave man (or woman) discovering the basics of survival. The game is rough around the edges in the current state but this is also a very early build of the game...so keep that in mind.

I've played diffrent RPG and crafting games before and quite frankly I'm not easily impressed.  (This is after all the only review I have ever written for a game or intend to write.)  I will therefore lay out what will most likely be a rather long dissertation on a deserving game in blocks that can be digested at will in this format:Things I didn't like (short list and always take the bad news first)Things I liked (much longer list)Things I would like to see integrated.  (Based on researching the game wiki and the discussions I've seen on the game's direction.)Things I didn't like:Not much.  Most of these have been brought up by other people, please accept this as my own take and as purely constructive criticism.Game Speed: I use a fairly good computer, but this is the first game I've had serious latency and fps issues with.  I read up on the game and how to mitigate some of this but it is still somewhat of a system resource hog.  I've read other articles where this was brought up and I also read that this is something that may be improving as the game is refined.  It is my sincere hope that this is the case because it was the only thing the prevented me from becoming addicted and having several times more hours devoted to this game than what I have.Animal AI: Likewise something that was brought up in different review and I agree.  In my case I kept looking around for the goats I could hear that kept getting worse and found a ditch close to my base camp where they kept falling in and the number of them kept growing.  I assume this had something to do with spawn behavior, but for now I just promised myself to return later to cash in on easily obtained goat meat as necessary.Things I liked:Two size blocks:  I believe this is an improvement over Minecraft.  Don't get me wrong, I love Minecraft for what it is, but this strikes me as the next logical advancement.  More complex shapes, better environment texture, all of this benefits from a larger number of building blocks available.  I have seen the type of complex mechanisms offered by games like Landmark, and I believe that this is overly involved.  A good balance similar to what is seen in Space Engineers is more desirable to me.  Possible areas for improvement would include slanted blocks so a roof can have an honest slope instead of a stair step effect.  I'm working on a thatch roof hut so it would look better that way.Crafting Component and Crafting Surface Interface:  I will admit that at first I found this to be a bit cumbersome as I was first learning the game.  Admittedly I jumped straight in without doing that much research or watching many videos.  After I got used to it though I quickly fell in love with the quasi-realism.  The system lends itself well to using the same components in different recipes based on what work surface is being used or what tool you are holding.  It can be frustrating, but in the long run rewarding.  I could almost see a realistic NPC trainer scenario where a player coul learn a recipe by watching an NPC or other player laying out the components on the correct surface and equipping the appropriate tool.Item Placement:  I have played Skyrim and one of the most frustrating parts of that game was the item placement mode that didn't give you much control over the items your were placing.  This game has definitely improved in that function.  Instead of containers that give you a UI panel to add and remove from similar to an inventory screen, I found myself actually making ""real world"" storage solutions.  My hut had wooden beam rafters where I stored my spears, poles, etc. for easy storage and retrieval.  My garden had a ""compost heap"" next to it where extra leaves, seeds, and other unused items went.  I am anxious to experiment with handles that I might be able to create a rack down the wall for my spears.Visual Appearance:  This game is a promising blend of something like Skyrim and Minecraft,  The graphics are beautiful and I can't wait to explore other biomes just as soon as I'm certain I won't get lost.  The realism of the gaming experience because of the graphics combined with real life issues like getting lost in the wild give the game a very high immersion level.Technology Level:  Where can I begin about the technology level?  Obviously, at the beginning, just like with the technology of the characters.  The opportunities for development with this game bogle the mind.  In its current state at simple bronze age technology there are a fair amount of recipes available that could be made and make a game comparable to Minecraft.  As technology levels increase, the addition of new work centers and recipes only serve to give the game additional depth.  The idea of going from Stone Age to Space Age and beyond seems enticing, but I am going to wait and see what transpires here.  It would also be similarly interesting to see higher and higher levels of magical complexity.  Rituals, better/more powerful potions, spells, and enchantments could advance with technology level as well.  This game concept has me excited.Things I would like to see integrated:After reading the section of the wiki on this game and seeing the yet to be introduced game elements that are still in process I wanted to be sure to add in the things that I as a gamer value and would like to see.  On the off chance that a developer might actually read this review, please take as focus group data if nothing else.Family/Tribe Generation: One of the somewhat disappointing aspects of Skyrim and Minecraft are the social interactions with the world.  This does not necessarily entail an in depth quest and/or dialogue engine like Warcraft (Long Live CLan Arandel!) or some of the dating simulators out there.  I was looking at the 'aging' concept presented in the wiki and was hoping that we would see something that might actually allow the character to spawn progeny.  Nothing perverted mind you, but if there were a spell called 'mating ritual' you could complete near a NPC of the oppostie gender that would generate or spawn an aging offspring from toddler up to adult would be most refreshing.  The villager breeding mechanic found in Minecraft comes to mind, but the villagers leave something ot be desired in that game.  I see self generated quests as players watch a wandering monster kill a favorite offspring and then tracking the monster (or PvP player) down for revenge.NPC generation:  I saw the article on totems that could have little podlings carrying out tasks for the character and I thought that this would be rather novel.  I like this concept and I hope it gets expanded into the ability to create a village of NPCs either through breeding (as above), conjuration, or perhaps even rescuing the people from AI Monsters.  The usefulness of these characters couold range from merely asthetic value to contributing members of a community.  I would go into more detail, but I'm running out of room in the review.Baskets:  Stone Age containers.  I don't mind chests, but the open air basket that holds stuff would be a nice change.  As long as they are stationary and don't fly everywhere like they do in Skyrim.Clothing:  The most customizable part of a character.  The Sims makes a fortune off of people that go onto their online store looking for new outfits for their Sims.  I think that level of variety is a bit overblown, but when playing Warcarft and all the max level characters look the same it gets kind of old.  There are several color dye possibilities with the mushrooms so a simple color shift might be enough.  I simply think that more than just leather armor should be capable of being dyed and the clothing options should change with technology level.More work stations.  Leatherworking, tailoring, jewelry, etc.  The more the merrier.  Crap out of room.  Later!"

,Recommended,277930,10418237,"Posted: 10 June, 2014",all,masterwriter42,"Thanks to various bug fixes, I can now change my solid ""no"" vote to a very cautious ""yes"" vote. Tug is an ambitious project that manages to bring enough to the table that's different to not be immediately written off as ""just another minecraft style game"".The graphics are smooth and appealing, what little sound there is in the game thus far is very effective, and the crafting system is unique and sufficient once you get the hang of it. Emphasis on ""once you get the hang of it"", as that's one of the biggest reasons I'm saying this is a good game instead of an outstandingly great one.The way that TUG is currently set up, when you start out the game they drop you in your world, pants or not, with no instructions what so ever. If you aren't a hardened vet in the genre, you'd better pull up a guide online and make notes, because TUG tells you absolutely nothing in-game. You might figure out how to survive and make some basic tools and so forth on your own with enough trial and error, but some players will give up long before they reach the point where TUG starts to shine because of the complex and unexplained nature of the game's mechanics. That's not the only issue TUG has, but it's still early access so some bugs and issues are bound to happen. It can be difficult to get things like beds to sit flat on your floor instead of lodged halfway through your character, sometimes items will vanish when you leave the room (such as beds) or will cease to be when you merely meant to drop them, for example. If you know what you're doing, these issues are rarely a game breaking experience, but it can detract from your ability to stay immersed and having fun.The act of mining in TUG is similar in nature to how it is in Minecraft, but like a lot of things, it feels more organic. I never thought I'd be looking back at the tunnel I'd just dug and thinking ""Damn that's a pretty tunnel"", but digging ends up being one of the most enjoyable parts of the game because of how fluid and unstilted the process becomes. Overall, TUG accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's enjoyable, not too difficult, and pretty to look at. If you've played Minecraft and are looking for something that's a little less precise and a little more organic in both look and feel, watch some videos of TUG and then give it a try. You could do a lot worse with your money on here these days."

Looks like another dev abandoning their game. As many other reviewers have said before me, I need to STOP buying f***ing Early Access BS! This will be my last update. I'm deleting the game from my HDD and placing it in my Trash category.UPDATE 06/24/15: The game was update again today, so I spend a few hours exploring the new features and stuff they added.- inventory system: greatly improved to the beginning of the game, still no wearable backpack, but at least the chest and backpack are working inventory wise, which is awesome!- the tools, armors and weapons that are in game so far are looking great- building your house is fun, though I wish there were a little more options for decoration and placing the already existing things (like when I have a item in hand that I want to place, a ghost image of said item appears which I can rotate as I want before I place the item)- combat wise I still can't say much yet, as I have yet to see any hostile mobs, I did some hunting this time, which is ok, but could use some balancing ( a tad to easy i think)- crafting, the system itself is solid, even though items fly all over the place when you put them down to craft, which is only a minor annoyance though. what I really don't like is the missing help within the game. If you want to know how to craft something, either you just try stuff out until something pops out or you got onto the web to look up the crafting recipes, which is what I did, but why can't there be a small guide (like in The Forest for example) that tells me what I need to craft. doesn't have to autocraft from within the guide, just a simple info book of what I need (just a thought ;) )- graphics, are awesome, I have the game set to max quality settings and it's running at a steady 60 FPS on my rig (see below), there are a few minor FPS drops now and then, but nothing that ruins the game for me at least, I'm sure future optimization will eliminate most of these as wellSummary: So with the current state of the game and the options available to play, explore, build, etc. I can DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone. It might not have crazy update schedule as other early access games (yes I'm looking at you ARK :P ), but these devs certainly are great when it comes to dedication and community interactions as far as I can tell anyway. Looking forward, to what you guys come up with next ;). Keep up the great work!!!UPDATE 01/23/15: So today the game was updated and I hopped in to check it out again. The graphics are great, the game runs smooth at max settings with my rig (i7 quad, 12GB RAM, GTX680 4GB RAM). Crafting is still something to get used to, especially if you play MC a lot like I do. I know they are trying to make it more intuitive I suppose, but it is really not. Just throwing stuff on the ground and then hoping something nice comes out of it, is not really intuitive. And the crafting system could be overlooked if you had some place to store all that stuff that you ""accidently"" craft. There is a backpack and a chest, both have no use... WHY!? how hard can it be to implement some more storage options for gods sake?I STILL believe this game has a great potential, but the devs seem unable to realize it... yet. There are so many survival games out there, check them out, see what they're doing wrong and what they're doing right AND maybe implement some of the ""right"" parts. What ... you call that stealing? Blizzard has been doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥with WoW for a bloody decade!Get to it guys! I DO believe in you.===================================================================ORIGINAL: First off, the game has definitely potential, BUT at it's current stage I cannot recommend it to anyone, but the most die-hard early access fans, like myself :).What annoys me personally the most is the lack of a proper inventory management. I like to collect as much **** as possible in these kinda games and TUGs inventory is ludicrously small. You can craft backpacks and chests, but they're only decoration right now. And the stack size of some items is laughable. I assume they are trying to make the game more realistic in that term, but hey ... it's a freaking game ... it DOESN'T have to be realistic. Or they're trying to make the game artificially more difficult by limiting your inventory, which is annoying as hell.The good parts of the game right now is the crafting system. It take a bit getting used to for Minecrafters, like myself ;), but it is really good. It lacks the variety of recipes that Minecraft has, but I'm sure this will improve with time. I wish there was kinda like a crafting book, that would store recipes that I already discovered, so I don't have to place down all the items each time again and rather just click on the recipe in the book and it would place them for me.Graphics are pretty good and it fits to the prehistoric (I assume that's what they're going for) very nicely. There are some hick-ups and glitches now and then, but nothing game breaking that I have discovered so far.Combat system, I can't really tell, since I haven't found myself in combat yet. There are predators in the game and they're supposed to attack the player, but so far I only seen one and I kept far away from it."

The steam EA version is rock solid one of the best EA titles I've ever played, and already one of the most fun sandbox games I've ever played. Note I've played MC, and several interations of the mod packages for MC, planet explorers, starforge (cringe), space engineers. What it is TUG is an open world exploration sandbox survival adventure, Your primary foes will be aquiring resources to progress throug the bronze age (currently only 2 tiers of tools are available, but the crafting system is awesome and can take some time to get going) There is only 1 enemy ai in the steam EA version (though the indev version turns one of the other roaming ai's hostile. My favorite aspect atm although limited in scope due to a very limited block sellection is building. This game trumps mc in that sense my first house on TUG looked more like my FTB ultimte residence - exterior decor because of the afore mentioned reason. My first house on vanilla minecraft was a block of dirt/cobble/wood. Whats more is the way the terrain morphs to accomidate your constructs if you start building something there isnt a jarring sudden change in texture, but rather they mold together.  Currently I'm playing the indev version on steam multiplayer is looming on the horizon sometime soon. As i stated earlier this is one of the BEST sandbox survival games I have played and i have played many of them. I also have played through the avilable content on the EA and INDEV versions several times. The EA version is deffinitely more stable, but the indev build for me is relatively stable as well. 10/10 from me if you love this genre then you will love this game, get it now before it goes up to 20 following the multiplayer patch.Update: Following multiplayer release game sitll runs stable my fps is up from mid 30's to 60's now on maxed view distance and high settings note I only have a gtx750 ti card and a amd fx 6300 cpu so its not  a resource hog.

76561197979005090,Recommended,277930,18377883,"Posted: 7 October, 2015",all,d1a2h3,"Its ok fact that they are a early access game that developers actually support and do consistent and often meaningful updates is the reason I recommend. (seriously so many early access games are a way to get paid for a game in pre-alpha state and then abandon it.)This game has a ton of promise in depth crafting different blocks item repairs systems lots of functionallity. And a building system that allows for much more ""fluid building"".But my major detractors if you are one the fence first and foremost it is a resource hog. So if your even kind of close to min system requirements unless you want to play at a 800x600 resolution at 5fps. I would reccomend waiting till optimization me personally I am very capable keep very clean machine slightly over system reqs and lag on that computer is a problem.Another detractor is the crafting system hundreds of patterns and you place items on ground and hit craft button. But oh no item fell off/away from stack you were one item short or perhaps to far away from edge of stack for all materials to be counted. So instead of getting item you wanted when crafting it is extremely easy to craft wrong item. And no longer have materials for original item. (especially combined with lag)Reason why these are not reasons for a no is first is optimization its always a later/last in development once all of features are in game. So it is coming and I have no doubt some of resource dumps will be fixed. Secondly crafting system   is cool in its own way. And I think perhaps instead of just crafting random item based off crap on ground. It could be fixed with a simple scroll system aka hit craft and a list of available items to build pop up."

76561198094020696,Recommended,277930,18177228,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,Kirg,"TLDR: Really cool and has potential but still evident that it is early access.Very enjoyable if a little 'unfinished'. Tug is still in progress (something the devs are very clear about) and because of this the world is still slightly deserted, there isn't that much one can do in game and there are a large number of bugs. But, even at this early stage it is still completely playable. The graphics are breathtaking, I may not be a fount of experience in regards to games and their quality but I have seen my fair share and TUG is definitely one of the better ones. The crafting system is unique and not overly complex, even if some of the recipes aren't always intuitive.Nerd Kingdom has a distinct and clear vision of the general direction in which they want their game to go and I am sitting on the edge of my seat in anticipation. While the idea of a procedurally generated world with unique quests, events, landforms NPCs, etc. may not be exactly new, their plan for a dynamic playable character that adapts according to what the player does with said character is revolutionary (that's what I believe in any case) and I am looking forward to the completion and implementation of this feature. I can appreciate the planning that was put into this game as well as Nerd Kingdom and its devs consideration in regard to the users/players and what they want (this is evident in the name of the game).The style and approach possessed by this game and its creators is remarkable. Unfortunately there is a downside: the game is very demanding in regards to processing, it is very laggy with medium-high graphics’ settings with reasonably capable computer stats (although if you look at how the world is generated/looks it is understandable if regrettable).In the world of procedurally generated voxel worlds TUG, is a breath of fresh air in a smog of boring Minecraft remakes, rehashes and reskins. The game is still incomplete and I wouldn't suggest you buy it if you are looking for a game that you will play for hundreds of hours without running out of things to do. I do suggest however that you support the developers of TUG, they are doing something amazing. From my limited knowledge of game development it appears as if they have injected an astronomical amount of energy into the creation of this game by producing their own game engine and doing things in a new and untested way. I would just like to say that I appreciate their hard work and consideration."

Basically everything that minecraft is, but much prettier and more realistic. Actual predatory animals rather than zombies and skellies. Great diversity of flora and fauna. Having to smelt usable metals, rather than inexplicably finding already usable materials just in the ground. Having to deal with heavily used tools oxydizing. Maybe a lot of people would find that tedious and not worth while, but I think the realism is really cool. Really hope to see it progress out of alpha."

I have always kept up with the constant updates going on through youtube. I orginally bought this game due to the ""sound effects"" animation as the idea of a world creating its own music was fantastic to me. I bought this game to support its creation, not for a final product. Moving into ver 2.0 I am worried of the new look (as I did enjoy the art style of ver 1.0) but knowing the concept and ideas/story are all still going to be there is why i have stuck around for so long. I bought this game to support its development into something i can one day state ""I am glad to have helped this become a reality"" You guys have my full support moving into ver 2.0 as from what I've already seen has always kept me around excited for more!For if I recommend this game: I bought this game years ago for its idea and to support the developers ideas. For no reason did I buy this game to play it straight away. I knew there was going to be a lot lacking and I hoped my small amount would go towards making it what they set out to be. Do NOT buy this game thinking you can just play it for hours on end as a finished product. Buy it if you (like myself) are captivated by the ideas going into it and want to make it EVENTUALLY into something you'd enjoy to play.I love this game (having not even played an hour of it) i am invested into its design process and feel totally connected to whats happening in it/ to it. I have never spent more time watching videos of updates from the team or creating fanart of its world and even coming up with my own ideas for what the story is and how it connects. I truly hope this game comes out the way they invisioned it and I will glady support its creation and afterwards, play it to my hearts content as the only game i have ever supported till completion."

When i say horrible, its like walking in on your Grandfather when he is rubbing one out, that type of horrible, you literally want to go to the washroom and wash your eyes with bleach in hopes you cleansed everything away.Why is this game so horrible you ask?Lets start with limitations, this game is extremely limited with function, and ability to change anything in the options menu. Secondly there is zero help or any tut's that will help you start the game, you are literally tossed into the game and pretty much have to figure it all out on your own. Crafting... well.. i still have no idea how to craft, i ran around for a ♥♥♥♥en hour trying to figure out what was going on and how to do anything, still didn't figure it out. Next issue was with this so called Multiplayer.. there is NO multiplayer.. there is just an option for you to host your own server on your computer for you and your friends to play.. that's far from what people really consider Multiplayers these days, i consider that more.. i dunno.. CO-OP.So whats good about this game you ask, well.. nothing .. it literally has nothing going for it.. its a POS, as simple as that, its $10 i could have spend on a stuff crust pizza from Pizza Hut.So put your wallet away, DO NOT buy this game EVER.. There are better games out there you can spend your money on, this is not one of them.Give this a 0.01/10"

If you understand early access then recommended.Almost two yrs later...vapor ware.. seems to have been abandoned. Recommendation changed, sry."

I had high hopes for this game and really did like it.. it was really unique.. then they just stopped developing it.Previous Review:IF this game continues to develop, I can see this being a pretty amazing game.  It needs some grounding and creative story.  I hope this doesn't go down the path of multiplayer PVP like so many others have done that end up bombing.  Multiplayer ... yes, could be very cool...  The basics are there and enjoyable.  Things dropped in the world are there till you come back and pick them up which is nice.  chests and backpacks are not functional yet so that is rather.... madening because you can't get rid of them... but I'm sure that will get functionality soon enough.  The devs need to finish the game before you start putting in multiplayer imho or it won't sell at all because the reviews will go down.  I like the crafting system.. it's rather unique.  I love the game but just not enough in it right now to keep my interest.. but will keep looking with anticipation to updates."

No Regrets. I spawned into a world, picked up a rock, hit another rock with that rock, used that rock to cut a sapling down, used the stone as well as the vine and stick from the tree to make a crude axe, and continued harvesting trees and stones until I had all of the tools, plenty extra supplies and had found an orchard of orange trees. Made a home out of wood and cobble stone and set up shop with a camp fire, bed and a crude workbench, I also crafted some torches. TUG is quite the enjoyable and relaxing game and I can't wait to see what else is to come from this alpha game!Gr8 B8 Nerd Kingdom, I R8 8/8 but seriously an excellent game.edit: aaannnddd then the game died....so sad to see potential wasted"

Progress has been relatively slow and there's no guarantee that they will reach the end. They seem to be working on it seriously, it's not a scam. BUT they like others might be chewing more than they can bite.PROS:- nice graphics- some 'Minecraft feeling' where you can explore, dig, craft, farm...CONS:- the world is a bit empty for the time being- graphics aren't very well optimised so you might need a powerful PC- after a few hours it starts to feel repetitive and there's not much to doI was tempted to not recommend it, but I don't regret personally. It was fun.But don't buy it if you're short on cash; wait for the final release. Only buy if you're happy to enjoy it as it is and don't expect more in the future.Updated on 11/07/2016: it seems this game is more or less dead. I don't have any grudges against the team, they failed, that's hard enough for them; but don't waste your money on this failure."
