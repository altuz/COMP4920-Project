But I could be very wrong as well, since this game is quite difficult and fun as well. This game may or may not be to everyone's liking or taste, but I like it even though it's not an easy game. Also after you die many, many times you unlock "" Soft mode""All I will say is that it plays great with the Xbox controller and can be quite difficult to play. BUT if your good at these type games and love a challenge then this game maybe right up your alley. There are also leader boards, & since I have only just started the game for a good taste of it, I do have some way to go to catch up with friends scores.What I will tell you is this: I am so far really enjoying this game, & the little robot is very cute & moves rather nicely around, but he does move quite quickly, so good control is what you will need, once you get the feel of the game.With out going into to much detail which I'm very bad at, I will just say this, that what you see on the store page and perhaps even watch some you tube footage of this game in action will and should be enough to help you decide if you'd like this game of not. But to be honest, playing the game myself I can say I have no regrets purchasing it, as I had been waiting for more than a year for the game. BUT sadly this is the last game these developers will be making, as they have said it themself's on forums, as I have seen them mentioning this while I have been following this game. I really do hope they have a change of heart and reconsider their gaming career & consider making more games in the future maybe after a nice break.Thank you all for taking the time to read my review, and thank you ""Two Tribes"" for making this nice little game, please don't give up yet o k;)"

,Recommended,278100,25507026,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,+/- Will,"tl;dr: Great audio, great visuals, great controls, great variety, ok writing, solid voice acting, solid price, bit unfair at times, will kick your butt heartily but it feels mighty rewarding to succeed.So, after spending most of my day playing this game, I feel I ought to give it a review:I felt that six hours was a bit high of an estimate from the developers.  I'm reasonably good at games, but I'm pretty weak at sidescrolling shooters; even still, I managed to complete the game in about four (and then beat the game again in just over two hours).  Before I go much further, I would like to say this: RIVE is excellent - its presentation and gameplay are highly well-thought-out and extremely polished - but it's a game that begs to be replayed.  Its greatest flaws are, for the most part, ones that wash away within a single playthrough, but if you're not so into the level of challenge RIVE puts out (or how quickly it ramps up), then those issues may really hurt the experience for you.Said issues include:The camera, while it does a good job pointing where you aim, can occasionally lead to enemies blindsiding you (particularly the ever-common ""Kamikaze"" enemy who chases you down on-sight and detonates on-contact).No invincibility period after taking damage.  This can cause small mistakes to get you killed incredibly quickly, even against non-instant-kill sources, while at full health.Taking damage from Kamikaze enemies creates a huge explosion, and the motion of the camera plus the size of the explosion means that you'll sometimes get hit by other Kamikaze enemies you couldn't see (since they very commonly spawn in big waves).The checkpoint system, while generally fairly intelligent, can sometimes put you in a very nasty position, or, in rare cases, fail to checkpoint you at all.  While it hasn't happened to me, I've heard about a few cases of folks hitting checkpoints such that they weren't able to pull out of an instant-kill upon respawning, and had to restart the entire level as a result.So, okay, I just frontloaded this review with a bunch of negative stuff, but I'm still recommending it - quite highly, in fact.  While the experience stumbles here and there in a first playthrough, when RIVE is ""on,"" so to speak, it'sveryon.  That ""dance of destruction"" tagline the devs like to throw around is an incredibly accurate description of RIVE at its best - action sequences are flowing, wild, perhaps even rhythmic.  Every encounter is unique, and while you occasionally revisit areas you've been, you often only cross over wherever you were for just a moment, then get straight into new ground.  Set pieces are frequent, exciting, and fairly memorable.  Every enemy type has a purpose, and every gimmick finds a new way to flesh out that purpose.  The controls are butter smooth and incredibly responsive.  It's polished.  Very polished.The music is lovely, and the dynamic shifts in intensity are well-timed - mix this with the intelligent decision to re-start the track off from about where it was when you died, and you've got a soundtrack that always matches the pace of the action, but never gets too tiring.  It's mostly not the kind of stuff you'd hum (except for the oddly catchy title screen/pause screen theme), but it doesn't need to be.  Sound design in general is just plain strong.  Audio is mixed perfectly; sounds are varied, unique, meaty, and just as audible as they need to be.  Sounds never step over music, nor vice versa.RIVE's visuals are just as polished as its audio.  I don't recall ever seeing any sort of seams in spite of the mad amount of movement and detail in the environments.  The overall style of the visuals, as well as enemy designs and animations, feel unique and enticing.  Camera movement and slowdown highlight action excellently - it just looks really good, I'm not good at talking about this stuff.As far as story elements go, I'd argue this is possibly one of RIVE's weaker areas, but it still holds up alright.  The voice acting is generally very good, although a handful of Roughshot's lines come out a bit stilted.  Humor isn't bad, but there's a tendency to rely on references here and there, and it feels a bit awkward.  You're able to cut out a fair bit of talking by blowing up your robot friend when applicable, but he'll sometimes still talk a fair bit regardless - a choice that I can't imagine is terribly necessary, since RIVE is played in an entirely linear fashion and there's absolutely no chance that player will ever fail to understand which way they're supposed to go for more than a few moments.  Ultimately, the story does a fine job of pushing the game along with some context, and I can't say things would be any better without it.  If nothing else, the story beats that aren't as skippable make for a good break when you're busting through the game on replay (although I do think I'd prefer it if the Speedrun mode pulled them out, entirely).In closing, RIVE is great.  Super great.  Super duper, even.  It's an elegant shooter that will makeyoufeel elegant.  Give it a second playthrough, and it'll be an even better ride."

(The main character & robot butler were generic & annoying the entire time I played RIVE's campaign)There are other modes in the game like a challenge mode & a no death campaign for example but in my opinion this is one of those games where it's a finish it & never touch it again types.If you really want to try the game I would recommend getting it on sale & I wish luck on all the former Two Tribe employees on their next game project in the future."
,Not Recommended,278100,32516952,Posted: 17 June,all,@MartinNLS,"I wanted to love this game. I was all about the gameplay and graphical style. I was excited about the game genres the makers said this fit into. However this game suffers from some creative choices that cause the controls to be needlessly frustrating. As with many games that have 360 degree free shooting and platforming you might find yourself stuck between two control schemes that are at war with eachother. The platforming is very precise except for when it's not, your character almost has too much mobility. That might sound like a silly criticism but what I mean by that is that there is some very punishing ""you will die if you don't do this perfectly"" platforming like you might find in a Mega Man game. While I certainly did die a lot in battles with the various enemies, which is incredibly fun, but it's the in-between stuff that requires pixel perfect jumping skills with a robot that moves so quickly it's very easy to overshoot and I was never able to get the correct rhythm down. The slightest mistake is punished brutally. There is one particular section that involves killing enemies while hopping on the top of fast-moving trains and it is just straight-up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then you finally beat it and then the game immeditately throws more enemies than you can ever hope to kill and they'll knock you back down again or just straight up kill you. It felt like the game just gave me a huge middle finger and I'd just had it. Challenging is one thing but this game is hard for the sake of being hard with endless blind drops of doom, barrages of enemies you can't possibly see coming, it's just too much.Then I know this is picky but does the protagonist have to talk SO MUCH? Thankfully they have a volume level for the voices because his endless talking to himself starts off as a him pointless saying ""I gotta go here, I gotta go there"" in a game that is TOTALLY LINEAR. Then later he's making references to Parodius and other classic schmup references, we get it guys YOU LOVE SCHMUPS. But for all of the claims that this game plays like those schumps they're referencing, it really doesn't. This is Megaman with parts that play like micro-versions of levels from Geometry Wars.  Maybe a lot of this frustration could have been alleviated by having couch co-op like Gunstar Heroes or similar but nope, this is a purely single player experience and I think that was a gigantic mistake. If they ever made another game like this which wasn't quite so frustrating and allowed you to play with a friend I would most likely buy it. RIVE has so much going for it but I just can't recommend it."

And the fact that it makes studios such as Two Tribes go out of business makes me wanna cry (I'm drunk now, otherwise I would've handled it stoically).It's very well designed.

What I mean is that this is a linear game with levels and design that rewards simply knowing what you are going to expect on a level, and not necessarily twitch skill. This results in a lot of cheap deaths, in my opinion.Games twenty years ago only knew this design, but today things are different, game design is smarter.RIVEalso has a polish level that stanks of AAA, with its cheesy (albeit well done) voice acting and corny-yet-safe one liners. What makes this title good is the super tight controls and outstanding artwork. It is fun to play. I began to have less fun as time went on, though. While there is a lot of content and replayability a la score chasing, I don't think I'll revisit it after I finish it (I think I'm on the last level now, and that took about four hours).The only thing you collect is currency. In the home base area you can upgrade your tank. There aren't many upgrades and since you get nearly all of them by the end of the game, there won't be much variation for a second playthrough.Pros:+Excellent super-crisp artwork+Tight twin-stick controls and good controller support+Yeah, it is fun+A few great level design ideas that are throwbacks to other classic gamesCons:-It is a linear corridor shooter, at the end of the day-Level and game design results in a lot of cheap deaths; instead of rewarding skill, it often just requires knowledge of the level-The upgrades are real 'meh'-The voice acting, while high quality, is cringe-worthy most of the timeI had fun, but I'd recommend getting this on sale unless you are super craving an old-school twin-stick with some great artwork."

,Recommended,278100,25501854,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,Techbane,"Here we have the swan song of Two Tribes: a balls-out hardcore hyperkinetic platform-shooter by the studio well known for its... puzzle games. Alright then!The humor is a bit overly cheesy and the 4th wall is barely even a suggestion, the player character has a tendency to ramble constantly and there's a surprising amount of dialogue even when you opt to shoot the guide bot to skip his speeches. I've had a checkpoint respawn me in the middle of taking a massive amount of damage several times. That said, it feels great, controls are really tight (at least on a gamepad), it looks nice, and most importantly, level design is both really solid and varied. Autoscroller sections, lots of platforming, zero-gravity sections, sections jumping between zero-gravity bubbles, some really tense chase sequences, and definitely never a shortage of hazards to life and limb or things to shoot at. I wouldn'tquitecall it a must-have, but the price is right and it's a really challenging, strong entry in a really sparse genre.PS: For me, the campaign was about 3.5 hours. Results may vary, but I really don't see it lasting 6. It is quite genuinely replayable, though."
,Recommended,278100,33119004,Posted: 2 July,all,William Shakesman,"An incredibly clever hybrid twin-stick shooter and platformer, Rive is good fun. This isn't an arena shooter, it's a decent length campaign with some good level variety, almost always throwing some new gimmick at you. The levels play decently quick, shuffling you from shootout to platforming setpiece to platforming/shootout hybrid easily, and gives the game a decent length with not a lot of downtime. When Rive is working, you'll be swinging from platforming to zero grav classic twin-stick shooting and back and again multiple times in a single segment.There is nothing to the plot. It feels like a parody that parodied too hard. It is too self-conscious and basically ensures there are no stakes to anything you are doing. Not offensive, and kinda charming at times, but mostly it is off-putting.Rive in a lot of ways feels like a traditional linear action game than many of the twin-stick games you have probably played recently, focusing on either arcade score chasing or arenas. Score is a factor here, but Rive has a different, more substantial feel than the average twin-stick game.Rive's platforming is good and the gunplay is strong. It is a fun ride. The fact that Nex Machina has front page hype and Rive is relatively ignored is an utter crime."

The gameplay style is unique and active, the characters and situations are humorous, the environments and level design are fantastic. The touches of comedy and game references are nice without going too far as well. It does get a bit tricky at some points, but if the whole thing were a breeze it wouldn't be as satisfying to get through. I have some minor gripes with control options, but once I adjusted everything was responsive and I could rightfully chalk up mistakes to my own abilities and not constraints on movement. I definitely recommend giving it a try."
,Recommended,278100,25687778,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Stargoat,"RIVE is both a love letter to video games and the swan song of the amazing and talented developer, Two Tribes. Having released games since 2001 starting with Toki Tori (a great side scrolling puzzle game), Two Tribes has consistently and obviously poured their hearts into the games they create. Unfortunately, as all things must, they have come to an end, but not before releasing RIVE, and what a game it is!In RIVE, you play as the sarcastic and pop-culture-referential pilot of a spider mech, trapped inside and trying to find the way out of a giant spaceship. The controls will feel familiar to anyone who has played a twinstick shooter - left stick to move the mech, and right stick to aim/fire. Pressing the left trigger will jump, and the right trigger actives one of four special weapons (selectable with the front face buttons). The game also lets you hack certain enemies, bringing them along with you as allies on the merry and explosive adventure.The production values of RIVE are as good as any of the best side scrolling games out there - full of colour and lighting, it's a joy to behold. The gameplay is a very solid combination of platforming and hectic twinstick combat. Never do you feel as if you're fighting against the controls, or as if the game is putting you into unfair situations (although it is quite tough).RIVE is a great game by a great developer, who will be sorely missed (I hope they somehow manage to come back and release something amazing later on!). Along with it, you should check out any of their developer backlog, especially Toki Tori 2, one of the best games I have ever played."

The game also offers several mechanics to make it easier such as fast respawns with extra health and even an unlockable easy mode (""soft"") if you die too much, but I'd suggest to try and beat it on hard mode as it's much more satisfying.Visuals:Very beautiful usage of post-rendered 3d sprites that really makes the game feel alive. There are some case where 2D games nowdays tend to make the player character too small and hard to distinguish, as well as other game objects. In Rive however, the scale and colors feel just right and it is easy to distinguish the different game elements (which is really important for a high paced game like this where anything can jump on you from any direction), it also makes a good use of zooming in and out when needed.Music:In terms of Music, Rive offers Music that sticks with you, From the fights, the transition segments and even from the loading screen, each music fits it place nicely.Sound:Nice usage of little sound cues (like the sound of taking ammo or health) and making sure the shooting sound won't be loud or annoying to hear repititively, the enemy sounds and more... It really helps tying it all together and giving the game... well...  a ""gamey"" feel.Closing words:It's a shame that Rive will be Two Tribes' last game. It's a real gem and this level of polish is something I'd like to see in more games. If I'm allowed some wishful thinking, I hope that this game will garner enough revenue and popularity to make them consider giving the game industry another go."

But I will say this:If you're a big fan of Two Tribes, you may want to rethink buying this game, it's very ""unlike"" any of their previous games. So even though it's their last game, don't jump on straight away.On a side note, this game really depresses me, 10% have managed to kill the end boss so far and I can't even get past a certain section. I thought I was somewhat decent at videogames but RIVE certainly put me into the baby corner, that's for sure."

It has all the right echoes from 90s DOS gaming, complete with goofy characters and ridiculous button mashing firefights. A tremendous amount of heart went into this, and true to the classics, running a custom engine means a distinct feel, not another cookie cutter Unreal or Unity game."
,Recommended,278100,29545214,Posted: 28 January,all,corndunks,"Rive is an action-platformer that takes many cues from games past. Though lacking in story and character, the game is very tightly designed with a large variety of enemy encounters that are just a LOT of fun. The succinct campaign that spans a dozen levels and several boss fights manages to stay fresh all throughout. I constantly found myself just barely scraping through tight encounters with just a sliver of life. The protagonist, a gruff bearded stereotype, only speaks by breaking the fourth wall: name-dropping old games and terms in an easy (and often failed) attempt at humor. This hackneyed set-up is unfortunate to an otherwise incredible game. I suggest playing on 'Hard'."

The game seems so incredibly polished and the soundtrack is very appropriate to keep the excitement going. The difficulty of this game is insane but then again I didn't realize I could do an armor upgrade at first.

Consistently high frame rates with tight, responsive controls.  I'm only up to the first boss, but Rive oozes polish in every way: controls, graphics, sound, and voice-acting. Rive kills you often, but respects your time: restarts load instantly and not too far from point of death, providing a carefully-crafted loop that hones your skills as you progress.  Very sad to hear Two Tribes won't be making more games, as this is their best, and it is among the very highest quality work available on Steam.  My advice: just buy it now."

Two tribes have made a thing of joy here, not often do titles come along that are so fun yet demand so little of your hardware (2 core cpu and some old nvidia 8000 series gpu?!).

The levels are varied enough where you're not doing the same thing over and over again. There's also a few side scrolling shooter levels if you get tired of platforming.On the downside a lot of the levels are ""find the trap, die, try again"" There's not much time to react to most new enemies and traps, luckily restarting is really quick.
