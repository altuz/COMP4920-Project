This is a first person adventure platformer with an amazing storyline that fits along perfectly with the environment and overall atmosphere. The amazing parkour present will give you a rush that never ceases to excite. Not to mention the astonishing scenery- it's on par with Bioshock Infinite. The hidden puzzles are awesome, and it is always a thrill to find them.Gathering gadgets and tools to get around a lot easier and have a blast doing it! Meet new creatures in a new world and discover the amazing secrets they hold, and find out the truth about your uncle.Pros & Cons++Pros+ Great Graphics+ Easy to control+ Controller support+ Puzzles are fair+ Amazing ideas for character models+ Outstanding story line--Cons- Character's have sketchy movements (sometimes)- Relatively short for the price  (2 hour example)- Too dark in certain places- Cost of game ($12.99)- No Co-opSummary  -Spoiler Warning-VVYou play as a person looking for ""The Uncle"" that has been gone for a long time. While you search for him, you discover that he has been studying things- things impossible in this world. Not only that, but you later find that he has a way into this mystical world. The Uncle has been studying this world for a long time, as is shown through the large collection of notebooks with extensive drawings on the creatures of this world, along with strange markings in the pages. Through his discoveries, you are able to take the passage into this world to try and track him down. While you search, you find clues and leftover inventions that he could not carry with him on his journey. These inventions are normally just fun new ways of getting from A to B. After a while, you discover a village filled with some kind of frog people, who praise The Uncle, and are very kind to you. They assist you in your quest to the best of their amphibious abilities. You traverse many obstacles and solve numerous puzzles to try and figure out where The Uncle might be, but you soon learn that nobody- not even the frog people- know where he is. After continuing your grueling search, you finally find him, and receive an explanation about why he left your world for this one, and why the frog people praise him- He was not simply a traveler that they deemed praiseworthy, he was in fact their creator, and even the creator of the entire world. After this explanation, you try to get The Uncle to come home with you- however, he decides to stay with his creations, instead of returning to his home. On this somber note, you leave him to his life, and return back to your home to tell of what transpired.Personal opinionI.	Love. This. Game. I have already beaten it once in under 2 and a half hours, but I plan to go back and play it again, both for secrets I missed, and foreshadowing I might not have noticed my first time around. This game gripped me like a vice with its captivating visuals and wonderful story- I really want to see more games with this much creativity. This game has a lot of charm to it, a good bit of peace, and a *shocking* lack of any rage for a first person platformer- it's very fair and lenient compared to others of its genre. It's an overall tranquil experience, but it is not without suspense for what will happen next. If you are a person who enjoys richly atmospheric games over intense action, this is the perfect fit for you. My main gripe with this game is the price: $12.99 USD for a very short game is a bit steep. While the gameplay is fun and the story is rich, the experience was similar to eating a delicious slice of pie (or cake, but as we all know, the cake is farcical)- it is great while it lasts, but at the end, you feel like there was a lot more than what you were given, and you ache to have just a bit more. I hope my opinion has helped you decide whether or not to purchase this game. Final recommendation: If you are a story and parkour fan, pick it up whenever, but for others, wait until it goes on sale. When it goes on sale you have no excuse not to buy it. No excuse. None. I hope I helped you all on your decision about getting this game. I 100% recommend this game!!9.5/10Proofread by Frey CloudseerIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:Follow here!"
,Recommended,278360,14408028,"Posted: 9 February, 2015",all,Trent,"[Edit: Maybe I just suck at 3D platformers more than I realized.  So keep my warnings of ""difficulty"" in perspective.  If you're decent at 3D platformers, you'll be fine.  I don't want to scare anybody away from a great game.  Anyway, on with the review.]It's possible this was the most difficult game I've ever completed-- with more deaths than I care to contemplate. [Update: okay, I probably died more in Ori.]  Of my listed 18.4 hours, I'm sure there was some idling there-- but not more than a few hours.  I also like to explore, enjoy the beautiful scenery, and take things slowly.  I never claim to be super-skilled at 3D-platformers, but this really stretched my abilities.  It was easier for me once I switched from a controller to keyboard+mouse, but I'm not much of a console/controller person.  Thank God the devs toned down a notoriously difficult section; I'm not sure I would have made it.  But the important part is that I persevered because I loved the game:  it had charm, a good story, superb graphics, and usually fun gameplay when I wasn't on the verge of a rage-quit.  ;-)  There's really nothing like flying through the air like Spiderman with a jetpack.  You really have to try it.Some folks probably won't find it overly challenging and kudos to you-- but don't be surprised if it takes some real work and repetition-- I'm not sure why this game is put in the ""Casual"" genre.  Some of the difficulty can be alleviated at times by finding an optimal/alternate solution.  So if you find yourself stuck, look for an alternative approach instead of assuming the game is broken, unfair, or just poorly designed.  It's not-- it's probably you.If you're looking for cheap achievements-- look elsewhere.  They are all actual *achievements* in the true sense of the word-- and I earned none of them...and that's okay with me.  I'll let the whizzes take on those challenges.Other than the occasional clipping issue, I only encountered one bug (which actually made one section of the game slightly easier as it turns out).  So all-in-all an excellent effort from Gone North Games-- let's support them and hope they make more!"

76561198067801573,Recommended,278360,12652550,"Posted: 26 October, 2014",all,ArmedArmpit,"4 out of 5A Story About My Uncle is a first-person sci-fi fantasy platformer that focuses on simple yet enjoyable mechanics: run, jump, grappling hook, and rocket boots. The player is placed in the shoes of a father telling his daughter the adventure he had as a young boy in search of his uncle, an adventurer who had gone missing. The young boy came upon a intriguing mechanical suit that fit him and a launch pad that propelled him into a world full of wonder, intrigue, and a lot of floating rocks.The good:The environemt is really well-made and offer enough variety to let you forget that you are in caves 80% of the time. There were standard caves, dark menacing caves with glowing plants, ice caves, caves of floating villages, and caves of artifacts from another time. All caves were enormous, big enough to contain a whole city and then some.The art style leans toward cartoonish but fits quite well with the fantasy setting that requires a bit of suspension of disbelief (floating rocks, duh).The sound and music were well-done and serve the mood of the game nicely.The dialogue, though few, was quite decent and the voice-acting was excellent.And the mechanics are very polished and together the setting, the art style, the music, the sound, and the gameplay made up a very immersive experience. It is hard not to feel the pounding of your heart as you run, jump, grapple and slinghshot yourself through various terrain with incredible speed. The rush is there, but gravity never did forget you. I remember countless times where I miss the right timing to connect my grapple then look up as all rocks around me shoot up, the wind swoosh by. and everything fade to black.The bad:While the mechanics were quite good. There were definitely a few places in the game where I felt there could be more  cues as to what can be connected with the grapple. In one instance I was supposed to connect to the stalacites on the cave ceiling to swing myself across, but no sound or environmental cues were provided. And I felt frustrated as I tried to super-jump myself across but inevitably fell to my miserable death every time. At another time, there were these glowing crystals where the player is supposed to use in mid-air to charge the grappling hook and further the swinging distance, but for a quite a few of them no matter how close I get no charging was possilbe. And so I had to plan my route not using them. Note that these frusrating intances are far and few in between, and the developer are still releasing patches, so I remain hopeful that they will be fixed in due time.final words:If you are looking for a neat game you can enjoy in an afternoon, and the idea of being Tarzan swinging in fantastical caves intrigues you, then consider ""A Story About My Uncle."" It is an atomoshperic, narrative-driven experience that takes you away to a different world one swing at a time."

,Not Recommended,278360,12789538,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,marmiteonpizza,"Hmm, I have mixed feelings about this game.The visuals are stunning (I play on max settings so don't know what the graphics are like on low/medium). The world is just beautiful (the foliage in particular) and as far as platform games go, the idea of this game is quite fun.However, there are two main downfalls of this game:1) It is extremely short! With only six levels taking approximately 15-20 minutes (if that) to complete the first time round. The majority of people writing reviews have completed the game in just 2 or 3 hours.2) The game gets VERY repetitive very quickly; the gameplay is almost (if not) identical in each level and there isn't a large enough variety of modes to support more types of gameplay, multiplayer for example.So if you love games made to look beautiful, by all means try this game out, but don't expect to ever play it again after your first completion of the game (I who have OCD about getting every achievement for every game am even struggling to find the motivation to play this game again for as long as it takes).But if you want a game you won't get bored of easily, has masses of content and you'll want to play for more than a few days (which is the majority of gamers), I wouldn't recommend this game."
,Recommended,278360,13901825,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,ownosourus,"A Story About My Uncle is a first-person platforming adventure created by Gone North Games and representing Coffee Stain Studios' first foray into publishing.The game follows the story of a boy searching for his lost uncle, finding himself in a wondrous place he never thought existed, a faraway planet where his uncle stumbled upon something incredible.The game is presented as a bedtime story that a father is recounting to his young daughter, detailing his adventures on the strange planet while tracking down his inventor uncle, with the assistance of various technological implements that he devised.As you venture deeper into the world, with the help of gadgets that allow you to jump incredibly high and soar through the environment, you will discover what kept your uncle from returning home. Movement is a big part of the game, as it mainly focuses on the exploration of vast and beautiful environments, swinging through the air with a wonderful feeling of freedom by making use of an energy beam that pulls you toward certain objects, like a grappling hook.You can only utilize the grappling hook a limited number of times while in the air though, so you have to use the energy charges carefully, in order to make sure that you're going to land in the right spot. Once you land though, your charges are refilled, probably by the mysterious force of the crystals found all around.The main attraction of A Story About My Uncle is the free-form movement afforded by the grappling hook and the rocket boots, and the tense moments between jumps, wondering whether or not you'll be close enough to your next tethering point.Although it's a first-person game, it completely forgoes the shooter component that is usually associated with such titles, offering a completely non-violent experience, that is driven entirely by narration and exploration.The environments are pretty varied, going from an underground cavern to out in the open sky, beneath a frozen mountain, through the floating jungle islands looming over a massive river and then back in a different kind of underground cavern.The movement is pretty varied as well, and you'll find yourself not simply cruising forward, but also falling to abyssal depths, climbing to dizzying heights and slowly making your way along the walls of immense underground caves, seeing your destination clearly and struggling to find an adequate route, gliding along the walls and jumping from ledge to ledge.That being said, the game has a strong puzzle vibe to it, almost all of the time imposing a strict route for you to decipher in order to progress, and not letting you experiment with the environment enough.But the main thing you'll be doing while playing A Story About My Uncle is falling to your death. Although the game is very linear, it's not always very clear about the direction you're supposed to go in, and so you'll end up doing a lot of experimenting to see whether you can reach a certain point or not, which equates death most of the time.This coupled with the fact that the story begins by being genuinely interesting, raising a bunch of questions, but then falling flat on its face, is another aspect that marks down the entire experience.Frankly, I found the lack of a great story the most disappointing thing about the game.The grappling hook gimmick is fun enough, and the game looks great, but that's not enough to carry the whole thing.The game ends very abruptly, and so does the story, raising many questions but answering none and making no sense, making you feel like the kid you were telling it to fell asleep and you no longer had to explore it in its entirety.It feels very unsatisfying when a story presents you with an interesting premise that it then can't figure out what to do with, so it just ends everything right then and there.Especially since going around the environments is usually quite fun and would have been even more fun if it were just a means to an end, and not the entire journey itself.The game also has some really nice graphics, blending light and shadow, glowing effects and colorful vistas, both underground and up in the sky, making for a great visual journey.You'll find yourself simply checking out the interesting view a lot of the time, especially in the more populated areas, but overall, the world just feels very disconnected from what it should be."

It's focused on jumping and grappling huge distances and the short-form resource conservation puzzles involved.  It's pretty simple--easy to learn, almost as easy to master--but also satisfying to play, pretty to look at, and over well before it's worn out its welcome.There's also a saccharine-sweet narrative delivered through some charmingly accent-stilted voice acting.  Both can definitely be rather awkward, but ASAMY's story has this comforting sense of earnestness, which helps overcome its stilted delivery and well-tread themes.  It feels entirely divorced from adult self-awareness, both for good and ill.Definitely give this one a look.  It's a really enjoyable way to spend 2-3 hours."

All the positive reviews led me to believe it would be a simple, enjoyable game, but it was so frustrating at times that I did not actually enjoy it."

You relive a story you´re telling your daughter about how you went out and searched for your Uncle. The game has amazing graphics and a great atmosphere. And while grappling yourself trough the world it´s really tempting to just stop and watch the scenery for a moment. The world is interesting and keeps you guessing what it really is from time to time, but sadly never really explains it. The mechanics of the game are fun and exist mainly out of your grappling hook and your jumping boots. The game doesn´t really have much replay value unless you are going for all the achievements which can be hard to get, after completing the game i still have 0 achievements.Overall, i can highly recommend this game to those who are looking for a short and interesting game."

LISTEN! )- Game builds affection between main character and a companion in less than 2 hours.- Some dialogues tend to be a bit dull.The game looks great, movement features work wonders and there is no trouble in finding the correct path, good map planning. However, the game is simply too short, I feel like a lot of content could have been added. More topics should have been explained and developed. Game feels rushed when it comes to story : beginning of the story seems fine but its later execution went poorly.The point is, it would be fantastic if the game was cheaper or longer (or both).

As you explore through caverns and floating islands you meet interesting characters who help piece together the gaps within your uncle’s life while forming your own story.Campaign:Overall the campaign is a decent length, you’ll probably get anywhere from four (4) to eight (8) hours of gameplay out of this. If you want to find every secret you probably could spent a significant amount of additional time playing the game. The campaign offers a variety of different environments, but ultimately it is relatively repetitive. You’ll go through caves, some floating islands, then caves with floating islands.The achievements act as challenges for this game rather than progression points, so despite the game essentially just being the campaign you could go back and play the levels as challenges to get the achievements, but realistically this has no impact on the actual game itself.The campaign is relatively easy, which perfectly suits the design and style of this game. You may die a couple times as you go through, but the smooth checkpoint placement and relatively simple puzzles make this game fun rather than annoying.Gameplay:As platformer FPS style games go this one is pretty good with the controls and hit boxes. You’ll find yourself rarely thinking that you should have landed somewhere you didn’t or hit something you would have missed. As the game is an FPS you don’t have to deal with poor camera elements as you could see in an third person platformer, but with this same light you’ll also find you may need to have your sensitivity up high if you need to make a quick turn-around.The game plays off you having a power suit that adds functions throughout the game, but honestly you’ll find that you essentially only unlock three abilities and they are all pretty basic. You’ll get the ability to jump higher, the ability to propel forward, and a grappling hook. You’ll essentially be using the same abilities throughout the game to solve relatively similar puzzles.Results:I’d recommend A Story About My Uncle for anyone looking for a relatively casual, yet immersive experience. The gameplay is somewhat similar to mirrors edge in that you will be running and jumping, but focuses more on utilizing your power suits special abilities to propel yourself through puzzles and into unique places. I personally grabbed this game when it was 75% off, and would recommend doing the same; but, if you absolutely love platformer fps then this is the game for you and you might as well pay full price.Pros:+Decent graphics and visuals+Relaxing soundtrack+Good story+Platformer FPS with some puzzle elements+Good check point distance (making dying less annoying)+Decent lengthCons:-Relatively repetitive gameplay style-Repeating environments"

It look's great, the scenery is beautiful, music excellent and the voice acting isn't half bad either, but it stops there.The core game play is first person swinging physics, you have a grappling hook with a limited number of grapples each time you jump to get from platform to platform. This starts out as a lot of fun, but quickly spikes in difficultly. Your grappling hook only has a limited range and limited uses between jumps, this isn't a problem at first but after one or two levels, the surfaces you need to grapple to start to become only just in range to the point of Limbo difficulty where if the jump/swing is not done perfectly you will fall to your death, a lot.The swing physics are fairly tricky as well. Quite a few times I found my self clinging to surfaces around me to try and build momentum, letting go when I had speed, only to slam into what I just let go of and fall. You also receive upgrades however they do not make it any easier as the difficulty again increases. This makes sense but it would have been nice to have an area or time to just enjoy care free these features.It's not a bad game, but it quickly becomes frustrating and I can't help but think it would have been better with a little more polish and better placement of surfaces to grapple to.I wanted to swing from platform to platform with ease, get lost in the world and while I'm sky high look down and watch everything become bigger as you slam into the ground like iron man; but I just couldn't."

,Not Recommended,278360,32260687,Posted: 7 June,all,I love the lag,"$14.00 CDN for just over two hours of ambiguous and occasionally directionless platforming is a pretty tough sell.  It's fun, especially once you get all the upgrades, but despite the exhileration of long jumping between floating rocks being pretty thrilling the whole time I wasn't really tempted to play it again.  Slightly glitchy (easy to get stuck on non-flat surfaces with trees or bushes or meeting vertices), voice acting's a bit strained and the tether diminishes the whole platforming thing somewhat.Still, given the setting and the atmosphere it might be a really good game to play with your child or even more appropriately your niece or nephew.  I have to give a negative review somewhat on principle, but I'm sure a lot of people will have fun with this.

,Recommended,278360,21766605,"Posted: 11 March, 2016",all,BadassFreeman,"I saw one of my best friends, Zoerith, purchase this game... And that got me to check it out, saw that it was on a pretty wicked sale, and decided to pick it up, as she has a really good taste on platforming games. And you know what? I don't regret it. Now as usual, I will start my review on the negative parts of the game. Granted, I didn't find many stuff to talk about......But the biggest downside to the game is how short it is. I barely reached two hours on it. (EDIT: 2,7 hours to be precise) Sure, I will come back and probably try to get all the achievements and hidden stuff on it, but it's sad that a game with such potential decides to just last two hours. Infact, when I reached the ending and saw the credits roll in I was shocked and dissapointed, as I expected it to keep going. It's a 13€ game without sales. I do NOT think a game that lasts 2 hours is worth that. At all.The other complains I have about it are rather minor stuff:-When doing a Sprint-jump, you can't steer yourself in the air. You can steer in ALL other jumps except that one, and it feels more like they forgot about it.-There are plenty of areas where you can sort of cheat through a section. If you manage to land somewhere, your hooks and rockets recharge, but I found plenty of areas where I was NOT supposed to land, keeping me away from falling to my death and cheating the area entirely. You can also clip through some rocks and walls in weird ways, for similar effects.-The voice-acting and music is good... But the main character and narrator of the story sounds bored. I don't know, it's almost like he doesn't care at all at times. There are moments when he says stuff like ""This is awesome"" while sounding extremely bored and that's just anti-climatic.-The hookshot range seems to be a bit random at times.*EDIT*-The animations on other characters are really weird at times. Maybe those needed some extra polish, as they usually feel unfinished.That being said, is the game good? Yeah, I do.The story is good enough, and it gets the job done. It would do better if it was longer, but you know...The sound design is really good, and if the main character didn't sound so bored, it would be even more amazing. The soundtrack is also really great, fits perfectly with the relaxed gameplay.Where this game trully shines however, has to be n the levels. It's rare to see games push the engines on making levels this big and with so much detail. And it also doesn't run badly at all, it's really well optimized. The loading times are also nearly non-existent, which is great.Gameplay, as I said, is really relaxing and simple. You can jump, you can use your suit to jump really far, you can use a weird laser-hookshot and later on even get something extra. There were a few areas where the gameplay conflicts with those weird bugs I mentioned above, but it was fresh throughout the entire game.There are also unlockables and collectables. I didn't really mind them much, but found most of them on my first run. I will say that it's cool to change the color of the laser... But why the hell did the game need a Goat Simulator reference on them, I have no idea. The achievements are also REAL achievements and not like most other games, being harder to unlock. I only got two out of 15 or so on my first playthrough, and that gives me prupose to get back to it at some point.So, in the end... Is it good? Yeah. However, I do NOT recommend it at the current price. I got it for like, 2€ or so. That's a really great deal, but I'd say more than 5€ could be too much. Bellow that, it's a garanteed must buy.TL:DR edition: Good platforming game but with a really high price. Wait for a sale, then enjoy it."

A beautiful, well made adventure, however short it may be.I've spent quite some time with the game, doing three full runs and looking in every nook and cranny for any optional story tidbits and seismograph-things, and I have to say I've come out feeling like the game was worth my money.The gameplay is enjoyable and new, (at least for me) and I love the first person perspective's way of making me feel like I'm at near cruising altitude while swinging over the cloudline, or a dark cave's unknown depths.The story is quick, but then again the game is as well. I liked the co-protagonist's personality. Adventurous, fearless... or at least we're told.She even is okay with risking her life to challenge you to try to get through an area without using the grapple device. (And while I'm on the topic she's also quite annoying on telling you that she ""knew you couldn't do it"" when you fail to complete the challenge without saving her life as you fall to your doom.)While I won't elaborate on the features of the Unlockables that you get from collecting all twenty-five seismograph-things, I will say this; the last one is AWESOME.If I had to point out some negatives, the character models can be sort of weird to look at sometimes, and during the parts when you have to watch them talk you can just wander away and not look at them and they don't care in the slightest. I sort of wished I could skip the interaction sections while trying to go for the flawless run and the grapple challenge achievements for the areas.There's also the MASSIVE difficulty spike in the final level, which I was not expecting, but the hardest challenge there has been patched to let people flow through it easier. (Lifesaver for the low framerates I had been dealing with from time to time.) But that's really all I can remember that I straight-up disliked.A Story About My Uncle is one of the best platformers I've played, and a good change of pace from the standard formula.

You have to launch yourself across deep chasms by hooking on to floating rocks and platforms and, my god, is it fun. While the aesthetic and story give off a casual feel, the gameplay itself feels fast and exciting and it never gets old.While playing the game, it is impossible to note the beauty and astounding level of detail brought into each map. It is absolutely breathtaking. There is a variety of different worlds that you have to explore to find your uncle, ranging from bright ice mountains to dark caves lit only by bioluminescent plants, and they all look amazing. The screenshots provided on this game's Store page are actual screenshots that can merely hint at the beauty to come. Look at the community screenshots to see for yourself. You won't be disappointed.As I said before, the story itself is pretty casual.

It's a shame the game is short. I got about 1 1/2 hours out of it, but considering I bought it for 80% off I regret absolutely nothing. The story is cute, and you got attached to Maddie really quick.

But I can't recommend you to get this enough!Just gonna put some quick pros and cons in here.Pros:- Beautiful world, really immersive.- Truly great animations.- A cute story to go with it all.- A REALLY good platforming game. Being challenging but at the same time not making it too hard (if you know what I mean, but maybe I just suck xD).- You don't need a beast computer to run it, even with the fantastic graphics! I know cause my computer is not that great.Cons:- I didn't really go into the game expecting alot of action, but I was a little dissapointed that there wasn't more hostile creatures in the world, it was really exciting when the first one showed up, atleast had my heart beating a bit.- I had a problem with sound, where as if I was facing a character while they were talking it would be very quiet so I had to turn to the side to hear them properly. Maybe this was just me but it was a little bit annoying.- The ending was good, but left me with a good amount of questions. Maybe that is on purpose though, makes you want to go back into the world and play around with it even more. Didn't know where to put this on the pros and cons list so it got its own section! :DI am new to the whole review thing, so be nice pl0x!9,5/10 just because the sound thing and the shortness of the game.

,Recommended,278360,13438584,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,Jadarma,"OverviewA Story About My Uncleis an adventure puzzle platformer game developed by the same people who brought us Goat Simulator. It shows much of that indie aura, as it is centered around a simple but nicely told narrative. The game's setting is future you telling a bedtime story to your daugher about your unfathomable adventures as a 10 year-old on his quest to search for his Uncle.Graphics - OKThe game's focus was obviously not the graphics, but the simple yet catchy gameplay. While you won't have any impressive textures, the game makes up for it in ambient. Lots of light sources and a colored evironment will keep your eyes entertained during playthrough, however if you are a graphics elitist you might be set off by some, but few lowpoly models. The character animations are pretty lifeless, however they are mostly there for decorative purposes. Overall, I wouldn't complain about the graphics, since they look decent and not the focus of the game.Gameplay - Fun but FrustratingThis is another easy to play - hard to master game. It involves you wearing a power suit that alows you to jump high, run fast and grapple via an energy beam to different objects. The goal is simple. Get to the end of the level. However, doing so won't be that easy, and you can easily find yourself repeating the same sequence over and over. A warning for completitioists:the achievements are bloody hard. They involve completing levels without dieing or using a limited ammount of grapples. A very hard thing to do. The game isn't so lenghty campaign-wise, but trying to complete these challanges will surely keep you busy.Sound - Soothing AmbientalThe sound is very nice in this game. Not intrusive, only calm music to serve as background stress relief, along with narratives at certain points. Decent voice acting, a nice touch overall.Pros- Interesting Story- Simple but fun gameplay- Relaxing AtmosphereCons- Hard to masterFinal ThoughtsThe game isn't much for replayability, however given the price I would easily recommend it as a casual experience."

,Not Recommended,278360,16484057,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic),"Disclaimers:(1)I played only 95 mins before I decided to return it. The farthest I was willing to try is just shy of the rocket-pack. This is roughly 2/3rds of the game, and I probably could've completed the game within the two hours of the new refund policy. I don't want to rip the devs off when it didn't meet my expectations. That's why I returned the game.(2) I respect the intentions of the devs with what they wanted to accomplish, so I am going to probably be nicer out of sympathy. However, I don't think this is a must-have game or an experience worth buying anytime soon.Please take any criticsm I have with these caveats.The initial impressions of this game had me interested to get this game on a sale based on its short length. The mechanics looked fun and unique, and the story seemed full of wonderment.Sometimes I really do like the narrative-focused games that run around 2 to 3 hours. More polished storytelling and gameplay segments for a reasonable price is what I look for in these kind of games (Portal 1 and 2, Thomas Was Alone and TRI: Of Friendship & Madness).And within the first thirty minutes, I was enjoying myself. Then after stopping after shortly an hour and a half to see how much of the game I had completed, I asked myself just what was I really getting out of this game.Problem with Linearity in Gameplay, Not Linear StoriesOnce you get the intial set-up and the gist of the gameplay mechanics (grappelling and power-jumping), the game doesn't seem to progress to anything more challenging or does anything different to offer variety with the mechanics.Although there are sometimes small deviations in the paths you choose, you still feel like the gameplay has only one solution and you are trapped within a corridor.A similar problem I have had with games like Magnrunner Pulse and QUBE is that the puzzles are scripted with only one solution. It's not a matter of using your powers to solve a room; the puzzle is doing everything in the correct order to reach the end.Besides the story-bits, the optional seismographs are lackluster; they're not elaboratively hidden in the levels, and they don't provide much to you other than a few unlockables fpr achievements.Even though the environments make you feel like there's a whole world to explore and absolute freedom at your disposal, there was nothing to set me off-course or extra challenges for choosing to go one route over the other. A corridor with a skybox canvas in disguise.A Small Story Told as An EpicMuch like the environments, the story also feels like something made much bigger than it actually is.Your Uncle Fred went missing months ago, now you wander in this dimension with some small clues about where Fred went. He was some entrapenour scientist/inventor who became obssessed with his creations and they took him to another, magical world he inadverently created.Good idea for a story, but not enough for this game. And there's not enough of motivation for the player to care.There are some optional story-bits that flesh out characters like Mad Maddie and her relationship to Fred or of the protagonist and his attachment to his uncle from one of many adventures. Moments like these are so few and far between the experience, and some of which are hidden as details on the walls as notes, that you might overlook them entirely.But other than these small glimpses of a narrative, I didn't feel any attachment to the protagonist. That's the failure of the narrative being given towards the player; the question I kept asking, ""Why should I care about this uncle of yours? He sounds like a farce.""Here you have the narrator saying how awesome his uncle is and recalling some part of the in-game story in past-tense (so he obviously comes back home). I couldn't really get too attached to someone who keeps telling me how awesome his uncle is.I'm more interested in my invovlement: What am I, the player, doing? Why should I care? What makes me invovled in the plot when it's been done already?Perhaps it wasn't the story itself but the delivery of the narrator that drew me away. He is far too monotone without any reason to be--the guy has an uncle who creates jetpacks and alternative dimensions!Maybe the narrator is supposed to be a blank-character that makes you want an uncle like Uncle Fred. Or perhaps you are the son/daugher of the narrator dreaming up the story about this uncle. (I'd believe that interpretation).But it's not just a lackluster character that ruins the story. The world itself raised more questions that were never answered. Why is everyting in this world floating islands? Why did Salamanders evolve into people (yes, I know they were transported here in a hidden story-bit by Uncle Fred when he took in those eggs) but what led to their cognitive evolution?Maybe I am not supposed to ask these questions. Or maybe I'm left to imagine the answers. The problem is nothing from the characters or the world made me grow any attachements. Only in the visual presentation.For example, you stop by the Salamander village for the first sign of Fred. You don't really talk to anyone other than Mad Maddie, and then you  get their crystal from the elder. Off you go again to find Fred . There's simply not enough time to spend there to grow attachments to any character or place in a game where that should be the focus of its time.The Game is What it isLackluster despite all the care put into the game.If this game was a proof of concept to flesh out a future game, I would be happy because there is the potential for something amazing in its mechanics and for the game to bring out a charming narrative.The game, if it ever gets a sequel, needs to remember the golden rule for stories, ""Show, Don't Tell"", because then we might be able to immerse ourselves in wanting to find our uncle in a strange world rather being told to find him. (Maybe some harder obstacles/challenges too.)But above all for any narrative-focused titles in the future, the game doesn't need padding for the sake of artifical length; let us immerse ourselves in the world you create at our discretion as the player. Let us discover these worlds; let us discover these bonds we create; let us learn through our involvement why we care for something."

The game has lots of puzzles and challenges. One of drawback is the narrator’s voice; it’s not the type that attracts your attention. In matter of fact sometime it’s kind of annoying. Another downside would be, you might lose focus of where to go from time to time, but in an overall I would recommend the game, maybe it reminds me of Valve’s game Portal in some way."
76561198092610980,Recommended,278360,14551210,"Posted: 19 February, 2015",all,Styngar,"First i shall start off with the essential points about this review that you will want to know if you buy this game. First and formeost this is a very short and sweet game, all in all it took me about 3-4 hours to complete as a casual playthrough, secondly, it is probably best to pick this up on sale for a cheap bit of quality entertainment this is because of the time it will take you to complete therefore yo do not want to spend full price on something that is very short.Overall the game leaves you with some very enjoyable moments, you play as the nephew of a famous explorer that has gone missing, and the game is about your journey through a strange new world that your uncle has discovered in order to find him. The game itself is narrated in the form of your future self telling a bedtime story to your daughter about the people and experiences you met and had during your journey to find your uncle, this in itself adss a noce feel to the game that makes you want to finish your journey and complete the game.The mechanics are rather unique and intriquing, simple to grasp and rewarding to master, i did have some annoying times with the sprint jump (occasionally failing to work) that led to more than a few deaths but apart from this one minor problem manouvarability is smooth and enjoyable allowing you to progress easilly through the levels.Overall I would recommend this game to anyone that wants a quick, easy and cheap (when it is on deal) adventure game that does not require you to think too much about what you are doing and allowing you to just enjoy the simple storyline and gorgeous landscapes that surround you and change as you continue throughout the game."

,Recommended,278360,13345514,"Posted: 13 December, 2014",all,∞ Mobius,"A story about my uncle first came to my attention when I noticed two things from the trailer. It was a first person game without a gun in anywhere in sight, and  is that platforming? Usually when you mention Platforming,  you think of games like Mario, Mario, Mario, and Mario. Alright there's plenty of other platformers out there that aren't mario. Without mention mario again, there's Little big planet, supermeat boy, freerunners, Fez, Limbo, braid and ""I wanna be that guy"" take the cake for this generation of modern platformers. And fangames, can't forgot those.Games like these usually get one simple idea in your head in the first few minutes. ""I'm dying alot..."" Skill is the one thing  games like these demand, and of course trial and error. Which is what most games lack now a days, inorder to help sell their products, and I don't really blame them, but doesn't mean I have to like it. I expected more from an indie title and  unfortunately this is where ""A Story About my Uncle falls victim to right off the bat, with the first and second part of the story. The game holds your hand as you try to complete the next jump, making it rather unchallenging about going through the first few levels. The idea of a well structed level design is there, its just excuted poorly, making me think either it was because they were lazy or in a rush. Or perhaps it was purely intentional, Because in the last act and level of the game, things finally do become somewhat challenging which I'll get to later.I'm a little kid again... thats what I first thought of myself as I was jumping and swinging around in the first few levels, but then the main characters narrative kept reminding that I'm in the past. I'm consstantly reminded that he's just telling a story to his kid inorder to help her fall asleep. The beginging of the game excuted my imagination as a kid fairly decent, only to be ruined by the questionable plot points in the story where things start to get a little ridicdious once you start to think about it, and the constant cut scenes where the main character starts talking, ruins and breaks the illusion that I'm playing as kid, when they could've just mentioned that part in beginging, only for me to forgot about it later.The story is okay, nothing too complicated, it's simple and obivious by the beginging, and by the title of course. However towards the end, I felt alittle cheated as if I had gone through all that for a simple pat on the back, with some small uninteresting dialouge and being rushed home. Basiclly like having sex, and the person you're with telling you get off because they already finished before you and thus satisfied.Now I did enjoy the game to a degree, it was admitly fun having the ability to reach long distances with this suit that grants you Tarzan parcoring abilities without the climbing portion. The game failsto change things up enough with  the exception of one or two occasions was this idea taken further, the potenial for an even more fun and enjoyable level design was missed, you can only jump and swing from rock to rock for so long, While the setting may change, the basic simple now jump on this wall, now swing off these rocks becomes too repetitive, where at least in other games, the frequent  challenging levels is what keeps me or anyone coming back. And it finally did, in the third act. So much I almost raged at certain parts, but I was also happy because now they finally make it harder, more difficult. and  rage indusing. I remember remember dying a number of times at one point where I was asking myself do I suck or is the game finally starting to wake up. It had earlier but died down.You only fight one boss in the game, which was a breeze, but I loved how it finally through me off from the repeititve level design that I had to endure until then. I would've like to have seen at least one or two more bosses, but one could suggest the final act was final boss.In the end I feel the game could've had more to offer, but it just offered below my expectations. The games has achivements and side challanging yourself scenarios, but I could myself ask to make things harder on my own without being asked or suggested to.  I really appericate the developers and the folks behind this game for their effort and I wouldn't mind at all seeing what they come up with next. Hopefully next time it won't feel rushed, and it'll be game I and many other will always remmeber.                         3/5I'm neutral about recomending this, if its on sale get it, if not well there's other games out worth your time. Portal, Portal 2, the talos Principle and the much anticipated game from the creator of Braid, which I forgot the name of."

,Recommended,278360,30460263,Posted: 11 March,all,¡★Zerafalgar,"Before I start the review, I'd like to clarify that I do NOT have 12+ hours of active playtime in the game, I spent around 9 hours inactive and at the time of writing this review, I apparently do have 12.4 hours on record according to Steam.Anyway, let's get into it:A Story About My Uncle is a game about a father telling a bedtime story to his daughter, the story is about the father's youth when he set off to a different world to find his uncle that's been gone for a while. I don't want to get into the story in too many details in order to avoid spoiling any experience  for you, whom are reading the review and considering buying the game. I just want to say, the story is not any extra rich and there's not too much of storytelling in general, but I still found it sufficent.Gameplay:So you're a nephew that took their uncle's adventure suit and teleported in a different world. There, you are stuck in an environment highly above the ground, having to jump over flying parts of land (call if flying islands if you want) in order to progress. At start, you only have a little gear, but later on the arcade around jumping over the flying platforms gets more and more fun. All features you get throughout the game are:Ability to jump really high (1 use)Ability to jump into long distance (1 use)Grapple into a place you're aiming at (up to 3 uses)Rocket boots boosting you into any direction you look into (1 use)>The uses of abilities reset everytime you stand on the groundAnd all you have to do is pretty much not to fall down into the abyss (there are a lot of checkpoints though so don't worry too much).While that may sound simple, I actually found it really fun. Overall I don't find the game any challenging, it's easy for the most parts. If you want a challenge, go for the Steam achievements this game has, that may actually make it harder. Also I'm sure this is a great game for speedrunners, the game is not too long even for someone clumsy at such games as me as it took me around 2.5-3 hours of actual time to get through the game.Design:I found the graphics pretty, it's just one of those games that shine in their visuals. The environment later in the game looked beautiful, no cons graphics wise except for the fact a lot of the textures were inaccurately placed, as i sometimes happened to clip through them. Mostly because I got into places I wasn't intended to be in, which I'll talk about later on in the review.First half of the game felt a little sinister to be fair, the sound effects and some of the environment (note there was a monster in one part which I found totally unfitting to the game), nothing too bad, but if you're weak to creepier atmospheres, this may probably be one of the very few reasons why not to buy the game, although I think that could be fixed with just turning your sounds off. In the second half of the game, I didn't find anything that would really feel creepy, I found the atmosphere much more relaxing.Sound effects were in their place, although as I said, there was a bunch of eerie sound effects in the first half of the game.Bugs/glitches:I'll just summarize them here really quick.-Sometimes, you can find a place you are not intended to stand on, this could make your gameplay severely easier either because of being able to recharge your abilities or clipping through the map and skipping large part-Some stones or places were literally just textures, meaning that when you though you could land on an offside part of the game and be safe, you actually fell down and respawned back on the checkpoint-Sometimes a little weird interaction with the characters in the game-Not being able to grapple something you should clearly be able to grapple on can ruin your mood easily in this gamePerformance/controls:-You have a lot of graphics settings, you can really set the game to ultra low or ultra high settings.-I cannot say it'd really be optimized, I played the game on a low-tier laptop and had to set my settings to as low as 640x400 in order to run the game on decent framerate, I can run games like Overwatch or GTA V on the same graphics but far smoother.-Controls were fine, I have nothing to complain aboutPersonal opinion on the game:If you like games of this genre, I'd say it's worth it, maybe not really for its full price but it's discounted quite often I believe (I grabbed the game on 80% discount). I did like the graphics and enjoyed the playthrough most of the time, only felt a little annoyed by the bugs/glitches in this game. I found the story ok, not anything that would grab you into the game and want you to keep playing but it did go just fine.Summarized pros/cons:Pros:- Fun gameplay- Good looking textures even for low settings- A decent story- Often highly discounted game on Steam store- Easy game pretty much for anyone- Good for speedrunning- Challenging-to-get achievements- Easy, good controlsCons:- Glitches/bugs, nothing too critical but still could ruin a run for you here and there- Around 2-3 hours of gameplay if you're not playing for the achievements- Quite bad performance- High base price on Steam store, for the game length- A little horror-ish environment for the first half of the game, didn't find that fitting the gameplay at all.If you're seeing this game on discount and you like the game based off how it looks, then go for it, if you read my review you can probably get an idea of what you can expect in the game.Thanks for reading the review. Have a great day."

You're going to be frustrated by the difficulty (but it's not impossible).Looking for a Challenge? You might find this game a tad easier than you're used too (even if the end is debatable on that aspect).Looking for a game where all the elements make it enjoyable? Get this one. The story is great the voice acting is surprisingly decent and the enviornments are interesting. The attention to detail in some areas as well is amazing, and everything just looks cool.I found the platforming to be difficult but this was my first time playing a first person platformer (though I have played other kinds of platformers). I don't recommend using a controller to play this game because of the quick reflexes you need to click on objects to swing yourself from place to place - that reflex is REQUIRED, ESPECIALLY for the last area - trying to whip your head around to nab at falling objects is harder then it sounds.There are also collectibles to find, both of no story value (if you wanna find them all go ahead) and ones that give more story dialogue (which I recommend you find they're great). Looking around for them can be tedious, but that's only really because there's nothing else to look for besides all of those but if you just want to find the story ones for the extra information there is a guide where you can find em all if you don't feel like scouring the place for them.Again I'm gonna say the platforming is difficult - I looked up videos after I completed the game and found there were quite a few people saying the game was too hard (which I don't believe myself) or was too irritating to finish (you have to be super precise with your grapple equipment - you can't waste charges unless you know you'll be landing on a platform) but if you think a bit more and try not to hit your head on all the floating boulders it's not that bad... Well for me it wasn't. I still have to agree that this game was frustrating but the pleasant music in some places and the story dialogue (and enviornments) eased my mind off of it for the most part.If it helps they have been doing fixes to the game occasionally from what I can tell to make some parts that were a bit too punishing easier for players that didn't come just for the challenge.I think this is when you beat the game only (I didn't honestly check) but there's a time trial where you can speedrun through the areas you previously did in the main game. If you really wanna practice with the platforming or you really liked the gameplay itself feel free to do those - you can also replay stages too, but I'm not 100% sure if you can reget the collectibles that way if you missed them...Also as a side note why was there a dead whale that was never brought up in story dialogue who is he why is he not in water where did he come from-If the price tag concerns you for how long the game actually is (About 2 hours give or take depending on how long it takes you to clear some areas) it's definately a good grab when it's on sale. If it concerns you on anything else (that's price related) I'd still grab it when it's on sale - it's a great game."

,Recommended,278360,17756204,"Posted: 28 August, 2015",all,MaxOfS2D,"I wholeheartedly recommend this game.It may not be the best first-person platformer I've ever played. It isn't. But it gets pretty close. The movement mechanics are really enjoyable, and you rarely get a jump that feels badly designed. The level design is good.My biggest praise with the game is its overall universe design. It really tries to go for its own thing instead of settling in on ""fantasy cliché #81672"", it invents its own outlandish alien world, and that's something that video games desperately need, as those have been really scarce since the late 80s/90s. It misses the mark on a couple occasions, but the execution is solid and I would have commended the game even for just trying.The ""production value"" has lows and highs. While the landscape is flat out gorgeous, the characters definitely have something weird about them. The good kind of weird (outlandish design that's not afraid of itself), but also the bad kind of weird (model and animation quality). Although animation-wise, I do like that for dialogue, the game went for entirely hand-animated the whole way through; there is no re-use of dialogue poses, and they never stand still, not gesturing, Oblivion-style.My biggest gripe with the game is the audio. The voice acting is alright, nothing's really bad but nothing's really good either. The sound effects lack some ""punch"", some clarity (I'm especially thinking of charging the glove, which sounds really weak). I thought it was really weird that the sound of wind in your ears when going through the air at high speeds was so faint. More atmospheric sounds could have REALLY enhanced the experience. And then there's the music... or lack thereof. There is almost no music, which in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but it really feels like it should have been there. The lackluster ambient soundscapes make its absence all the more noticeable.My first reaction to the game ending was that it was pretty short, and that I wish I'd seen one or two more locations in this magical world... but on the other hand, it's good that the game doesn't pad itself or overstays its welcome, and lasts just the right length before making all that grappling and jumping lose its charm.This is unlikely to happen at the time of writing this review but I wouldn't mind seeing some DLC that expands on the world, maybe from the point of view of the uncle. That'd be pretty great!If I had to assign this game a rating, I'd say 8/10. But despite its flaws you should absolutely buy and play this. NOW."

It's a very simple platformer, with jumps and a grappling hook. It looks decent and the controls are good. There's a definite sense of wonder as you roam around the world, and it feels genuinely good to fling yourself around the levels.I will say, however, that despite the beautiful scenery, the game does feel rather empty. There's not a lot to do. I would have appreciated more puzzles other than ""How do I get from A to B?"", or perhaps stuff to collect. There are a few inspired set piece moments, but they're few and far between.Some of the jumps are very unforgiving as well, mostly due to not being able to see what you can latch on due to distance. There's also sometimes not a clear path forward.I could also nitpick the voice-acting. While the actors themselves are pleasant and well-cast, they have trouble delivering the lines. They're clearly reading verbatim from a piece of paper, and will sometimes hesitate, pause, and almost stammer, especially the main character. It's hard to believe a voice director would let that slide without another take.Still, while that sounds like a lot of negatives, I still am enjoying my time with the game. Pick it up when it's on sale like I did; it's worth your time."

The story telling is nice.(kept me hooked for the most part) The voice acting was OK, the narrator wasnt bad at all. A problem I had was telling the different between the daughter or madeline at times, but that was probably due to the fact my attention was pulled else where.

In the 2nd half of the game, the checkpoints get unevenly placed, often requiring you to re-do some frustrating platforming.What's more is that you have to be at a precise range for your grappling hook to be activated. I had a couple of occasions where I missed my intended point by just a few inches which made me plunge to my death. And since the checkpoint was a bit way back, I had to do some sections before I could get back to the frustrating part to retry. If I missed it, it was back to square one.This could've been avoided if the checkpoints were placed right before the frustrating bits. But nope, it wasn't. And if I failed a certain point it took way too long for the game to restart from the previous checkpoint as you have to waste too much time seeing your character plunge to his death. Sometime you don't even know where to go and you end up just dying and have to watch the overly long plunging animation.. Just make the time before restarting from the previous checkpoint just a bit shorter and place the checkpoints immediately before frustrating parts and this would've been a gem.The story is nothing to write about and ultimately this game could've done with a couple more play testing and refinements before release to minimize frustration. And it is a bit short for its full asking price. Ultimately, a game's ultimate objective is to make the player have fun and not leave the gamer with a frustrating experience."

It's a bit short, but to be honest, I would rather have a short, high-quality game than a long, low-quality game.I really enjoyed the first-person gameplay in A Story About My Uncle, and I think the devs did a great job with the mechanics. Games like Mirror's Edge and Dying Light have always been enjoyable to me, and I think A Story About My Uncle is actually better than them in some respects. Take Mirror's Edge, for instance. When you could really land jumps and time everything right, it feltgreat- like you were flying. In A Story About My Uncle, you get this feeling much more often. Sure, sometimes you get stuck on a puzzle, but for the majority of the game, the movement is fantastic.This game is visually fantastic as well. The world that the devs have constructed is absolutely gorgeous, and I loved the architecture of floating structures, the glowing caves, and the enormous mountains. I feel like a lot of modern games have lost the ability to project that objects in-game arebig, but A Story About My Uncle does it very well.As far as my complaints, there are few. I noticed many people complaining about the last parts of the game being awful to navigate, however I did not have any trouble with it. Personally, I would have liked to see the final bits of the game be a bit more visually perfected, as the previous bits of the game looked measurably better. The other problem I had with this game was the voice acting. Let me say that this is VERY FORGIVABLE, but I still felt the game would have been better, had there been better voice actors (and maybe more emphasis on narration in general).Overall, A Story About My Uncle is a very fun, beautiful, and interesting game. As I said, it's a bit short, so you might question paying full-price, which is understandable. However, if you think it's worth it, you should definitely give the game a try."

Bioshock Infinite was my favorite gaming world before this and I still love Columbia for its Steampunk beauty but this is something else. The effort and dedication put into each level and set-piece is astounding coming from an Indie developer. Also, there is no combat so far so there is more time to let the beautiful setting take you away (unlike Bioshock Infinite where almost constant combat did not leave enough time to enjoy the beauty of the city). Before objectives you can run free and explore the villages and whatnot where every little detail put into the world makes it worthwhile. Also, there is no stress of combat put upon the player so this is a truly relaxing experience. Now for the gameplay itself. The gameplay is simply platforming and grappling hook puzzles that manage to be challenging while not too punishing. Certain puzzles may leave you frustrated at times but when you overcome the obstacle you feel accomplished. However, one small mistake leaves you to die and a slightly miscalculated jump will end your life. Thus, the game becomes slightly challenging. Furthermore, the game is beautifully narrated as a father telling a child a bedtime story and the childhood mysticism with foreign lands and new experiences is beautifully realized in an almost Seussian manner. In the story, I noticed subtle commentry by the narrator on topics such as racism and over-pollution of earth which I found very interesting. Throughout the narration, you feel the narrator pining for love from a father figure, even going as far as to relate to other species, which he says shouldn't be normal, being as they are, frog people (thus the commentry on racism). Overall, ""A Story About My Uncle"" is an absolutely amazing game from very skilled developers with many endearing qualities and is absolutely worth every single penny and more."

(goes from 60-120, I played it at 100 just fine.)Neutral:* completed it in about 4 to 4.5 hours. Probably could have gotten through it in 3 if I wasn't screwing around so much.* seemed that there were multiple ways to get through several of the levels.* no map or minimap, easy to get lost and not know where to go, but more realistic I guess.* need a mouse and keyboard to play. it's a precision first person shooter/action platformer, you need to be able to make fast and accurate shots to the next grapple area while freefalling down.* mouse acceleration on by default, but easy to turn off in the options.* the game gets dark and hard to see sometimes, but makes for a great appeal when you fall down to the dark abyss after you miss a grapple. Adjustable gamma in options, but that's not enough.* graphics options are just acceptable imo. (https://i.imgur.com/RO5WWnQ.jpg)Cons:* not too much replayability (aside from trying to complete the levels faster/with fewer hooks)* there were several times I got confused and had no idea where I was going or where the next objective was. Several times I just jumped off the cliff without knowing where the next grapple spot was.* one time during the story, your ""double jump"" gets arbitrarily broken and unusable, only to get fixed in the next zone.* there is no obvious way to make a followup. The way the game ends makes it obvious that it's a standalone game, which is a shame, I want to explore more of the wonderful world that they built and fly around in the air more.It's a great little piece that more people should play.

Even Half-Life's first-person platforming was a bit dodgy, but Uncle dodges tactfully around this issue by making a lot of the actual platforming be based in the air rather than on landing tricky jumps onto the ground. There's a very fun, tangible sense of speed to be found and the mechanics are fun in a Garry's Mod sort of way. And, for the record, the 3D modeling and texturing is far better than I would expect from an indie studio.All in all, it's a fun, exhilerating game with beautiful scenery and unique controls that flow flawlessly.

By the time the game was ending, I felt that I had only just begun my adventure. I would have liked to see more environments and more boss monsters to get past besides the first one you encounter. A longer game would have supported the story too as you continuously stumble upon more villages, constantly hearing about how you just missed your uncle by a few days, adding an air of mystery around him. I got to the ending and I have to say it was really anticlimactic. I thought I was moving on to another challenging area, and was dissapointed to find out that that was it.Other than that, this game has everything spot on as far as gameplay goes.

A first-person platformer on floaty mountains with the narrative pacing of Dear Esther.You are a nephew who has discovered a suit from your uncle's laboratory that will take you to a mysterious place where rocks float on air.  The suit acts as a device that tethers platforms much in the same vein as Just Cause but with limited usage.  Like portal, the whole mechanic is soly based on that specialized item.  The passive narrative is driven by the player recalling his experience as you move on allowing the exposition to slowly reveal the elements of this strange new world and universe.  I would go on but that would go into spoiler territory.Because I don't believe in a scoring system, I will present my review in binary fomat listing the postives and negatives of the game.  I believe it is up to the user to judge the content of the review rather than the overall value of the score:+ Very polished for an indie title.  The UE3 engine runs optimially with nary a frame-drop at 60fps.+ Control scheme is simple with utilizing only the directional keys, spacebar and the two mouse buttons.+ Tethering system gives a sense of vertigo, like Bioshock: Infinite's rail-hook but with the flexibility of a grappling hook.+ Voice-acting is well done and is presented without being too over-the-top nor does it take itself too seriously- Even for a short game, the game has quite amount of level-padding.- Platforms can get very confusing esepcially how much agency you have over gravity.  Getting disoriented can happen on occasion that can throw off the player's sense of direction.-  Some scripted occasions take control away from the player with micro-story elements.  It woud've sufficed being in the background just like the reset of the narrative.Overall, it is one experience I highly recommend, especiallly for an indie title.  I hope to see more ambition from their games in the near future."

The atmosphere is excellent, and the levels are fun and challenging without being hard just for the sake of being hard.The game is relatively short, only 2-3 hours on a first play-through, but I honestly prefer that in games these days - when your days are long and you have little time for video games, it's nice to be able to finish one in just a few evenings! A Story About My Uncle doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't feel either dragged out or rushed. For people looking for more gameplay, there are quite a few collectibles to give it some replay value if you didn't catch them all the first time through.Each of the different areas has its own distinct feel and its own mechanic - everything from glow-bushes in the pitch black to stalagtites that fall when you grapple from them. The different biomes are well-realized, with attention to detail. The windmill village, especially, is quite lovely. The mechanics all feel smooth and well-implemented. They aren't necessarily anything extraordinarily innovative, but they feel fresh within the context of the game. It's not just some stale re-hashing of old ideas; everything fits into the game nicely.The bedtime story vibe of the game is one that resonates with me. It keeps the tone light, even as a couple of the areas are rather foreboding. It moves the game along, keeps you engaged with the narrative, and generally provides an excellent backdrop to the gameplay.There are a few things that I think could have been done better. The game could have benefited from some more attention to the soundtrack. I'm not saying that the soundtrack was *bad* by any stretch of the imagination, just... the ambient sounds were just that: extremely ambient without having any interesting melodies. I'm a huge sucker for games with a good soundtrack. Additionally, it would have been fun to be able to interact with and speak to the various NPCs. Just having some textual dialogue, even if it wasn't voice acted, would have been neat. It would have given the towns a bit more life.Overall, however, I definitely recommend this game! I'd certainly buy it again. I don't think I'd pay full price, but if you see it for around $5-7, I'd say you're going to be getting your money's worth."

Not only does it feature an annoying spoiler, it could also give the false impression that this game can be classified between such little gems as 'Dear Esther' and 'Journey'. After all, we see a story-heavy game, set in a beautiful world and introducing an unique gameplay-mechanic. Though  'A Story About My Uncle' is certainly amusing, in the end it cannot live up to these expectations.Let us consider the story first. The narrator tells to his daughter a story about his uncle Fred, who had suddenly disappeared. In search of him, his nephew had to enter an underground world consisting of floating rocks. With some help of the frog-like creature Maddie, he had to traverse this world using a mysterious power suit with a grappling hook, which enabled him to jump and float from one rock to another.This story however is a bit cliche at some times, but more importantly, it really never becomes exciting. There is not much of a hurry to find uncle Fred, as there are no clues that something is wrong with him. In the end, the plot is enough to drive the game forward, but it certainly could have been less dull.'A Story About My Uncle' (despite its title) is therefore more a game you play for its gameplay than for its story. Luckily then, the gameplay is more exciting than the story is. It is fun to traverse huge caverns without touching the ground, making enormous jumps and floating from great heights, especially in the (sparse) areas where you can choose your own path. Due to some difficult parts, it is sometimes hard to come into a flow, but when this happens, it feels great.The only real downside to the gameplay is that it offers too little variation. After all your moves are introduced in the first level, the gameplay stays more or less the same during the full 4 hours the game last (probably longer if you go for some fun achievements and hard-to-find unlockables). You do get some upgrades for your suit, but these do not change the gameplay much. I therefore would not have mind if the game had been an hour shorter, especially since the last level contains some tedious parts.In the end, 'A Story About My Uncle' is still an amusing little game, which offers good value, especially when you pick it up in a sale. Just do not expect too much of it, and as I said, do not watch the trailer.7/10"

It’s interesting to say the least. I started having an interest in the title, an odd title for a game. Then by the genre: first person platformer, a rare genre for a game. A genre that often doesn’t work out because in first person games your feet are normally purely academic. I was interested by the price point, at £1.50 on sale. Finally, I was interested by the length at only 3 hours, there’s something nice about having a short but succinct game that does its thing, tells its story and doesn’t hang around long enough to get stale. That succinctness brings focus and tightness in narrative and gameplay, and is why most people would say Portal is a better game than Portal 2. So I dived into ASAMU without any knowledge of it other than the price, the length and the genre. That lack of knowledge is normally the way I like to experience a new game for the first time.The story is told by (some excellently acted) narration, as a father tells of how he travelled to a mystical world to find his uncle to his daughter for a bedtime story. You play as younger version of the father on said adventure to find his uncle. Ironically the game is much less a story about your uncle than it is about the world you explore as you find him. I won’t spoil anything, I think that’d be cruel. But I will say that the game perfectly evokes this whimsical feeling of childlike wonder as you soar through the air, exploring a world that belongs in child’s fantasy. The game has its fair share of heart-warming moments but the majority of the wonder in this game is found in the scenery and how you traverse it.The core gameplay is based around using one of your uncle’s inventions, a suit, to jump really high and grapple. As you progress you unlock the ability to grapple multiple times in the air and later find some rocket boots that allow you to shoot forwards in a dash of uncontrolled speed. You start being able to grapple once in the air, with the grapple restoring when you hit the ground, but by the end of the game you can grapple three times in a row. The game compensates for the lack of precision the first person perspective by having momentum based gameplay that requires speed and technique. You’ll mostly be using the grappling hook to swing from rock to rock across high, breath taking chasms. It’s more like using gravity and momentum in Portal or surfing in TF2 or CS:S than it is platforming in a traditional sense. Think that could get samey? Well it doesn’t, swinging from place is just super satisfying, and the first person perspective only emphasises that. I can’t imagine this game working better in 3rd person. It’s not hard but it doesn’t need to be, just gliding through the air just a reward on its own. Having said that the game does ramp up challenge later on, some highlights being: crossing a bottomless chasm by hopping and grappling between falling blocks, and crossing a floorless cave by grappling from stalactite to stalactite (that fall when you grapple onto them) and occasionally shooting energy crystals that restore your grapple energy to full, allowing you to restore your energy without hitting the ground and grapple indefinitely. The entire game just feels epic.Visually, the game is gorgeous. Its worlds are breath-taking and the environments are always clear and crisp. But unfortunately the visuals are the only source of my gripes with this game, with all the character models look pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥poor, with faces looking like they’re melting, eyes looking googly like they’re about to pop out of their sockets, and hair looking solid and plastic. The animations of characters are odd too, they just look awkward and janky. But it’s such a minor gripe, because most of your time in game is spent alone soaring across chasms.All in all A Story About My Uncle is an interesting and unique tale, full of childlike wonder and tightly executed mechanics. It doesn’t outstay its welcome, it had heart-warming moments, it feels great to play and when it’s so short and at such a low price I’d recommend you pick it up any day."

However, it's heavily flawedtl;dr- Good game, could be better, a bit frustrating, but short and fun enough. 10/10.Ever heard of a physics-based game with a broken physics engine? Well, now you have!Hitting walls makes you bounce off them, which is the single most annoying problem this game could have.For example - sometimes, the game gives you very small opportunity windows to hit rocks with the grappling beam, and when you do hit them, you fly straight into them, which results in hitting them and flying backwards or simply stopping, resulting in getting to the next stone impossible, and having to repeat the same sequence many times. Also,Using the rocket boots slows you down after the initial boost, what the hell?Aside of that,gameplay wise, some of the puzzles are not intuitive at all and are quite frustrating, most of the time it's really hard to see where you're supposed to go, forcing you to fail multiple times for no reason before you actually see the path.It feels as if whoever made this game tried too hard to be innovative while challenging the player at some areas but completely missed the point, this game is way harder than it should be.Good thing is,it's still REALLY fun to play, all of the problems I stated ARE frustrating, but the concept of the game and the fact that in the end it's all solveable are good enough to enjoy it, in addition,this game is short and yet ends exactly in the right spot(took me about 3 hours), not too long, not too short.Graphics wise, this game is phenomenal, even when running on my machine which is based on a simple intel graphics cards, the world is beautiful and colorful and fun to stop and look at when possible. However, at some points its acting a bit weird, but since it could only be on my machine I cannot judge it.Storywise there isn't much to say - it's a sweet and fun adventure, not much background to it, but it's okay, because it doesn't need to be much, it's nice and simple, my only complaint is on the voice acting, especially the narrator's, the man almost sounds like one of those computer generated voices.In conclusion - I feel like this game could have been 10 times better, the main idea is wonderful, but the devil is in the details, it feels somewhat unfinished, not polished, as if something is missing, but it's still a good game as it is, I don't recommend buying it for full price, get it on a sale and have a short fun adventure.Sidenote - the achievements system on this one is a bit too much, could I at least get an achievement for completing the game? :P"

The commentary on the proletariate and bourgeoisie is amazing. They even managed to include a massive threat that keeps the proletariate down in the form of a giant worm (the symbolism for fear is stark).Marxist remarks aside you're sent on your way to find ""Fred"", your uncle, an explorer who aparently started the society in the cave. You must navigate a series of increasingly difficult platforming segments with a special suit that makes it so that you can grapple to surfaces, you can bound very high in the air, and at certain points you even get some rocket boots.It is a very short game from what I understand and I'm most of the way through it. Hopefully I finally find my uncle and confront him on the socio-political devide he has created among the frog people and right the wrong that he has made by surpressing the poor cave frog people."

,Recommended,278360,21931313,"Posted: 19 March, 2016",all,SparklyChaos,"A Story About My Uncleis a visually stunning first person, swing-type platformer where you as the protagonist must journey through an unknown world to find your uncle. This strange world is inhabited by these equally as strange anthopromorphic frog people, but only like four of them talk and only one is actually important.Now before you read the rest of the review, keep in mind that I really liked this game, it's just much easier for me to critisize than praise. Also ****Warning: There's going to be SPOILERS, especially near the end of the review.****So first things first, this game is absolutely beautiful. The bright starry skies and glowing crystals and floating islands in general make this game very appealing to look at as you travel from place to place. The atmosphere that each location portays is pretty spot on, with the warm, bright yellows in the village and the dark, cold blues in the caves. I never got used to the scenery, every place I went I was astounded by the colors and expansiveness of the world, even in the ice caves where all the walls and platforms mixed in blues and blacks, the glowing crystals just made everything so alive.Second, the frog people. They're not inceredibly appealing to look at, but it's to be expected, since, you know, they're frogs. I wish there could have been a lot more interaction with them, because it would have be really cool to hear their accounts of their lives in the caves or maybe how they came to know your uncle, to give him a little more characterization, but I suppose they weren't really the main point of the story. The first person you meet in a young frog girl named Madeline, though people always call her ""Mad Maddie"" (I actually have no idea why that is, even after finishing the game), who seems to be very close to your uncle, saying she's ""known him all her life"" even though he's only been gone for a couple of months. She's your generic 'I don't wanna stay in my hometown cause it's boring but no one will let me explore cause it's dangerous' character. I hated her, mostly cause she was annoying to me and follows you around for the half the game, but she's not actually that bad. Just a little underdeveloped, like a lot of other things.Now, ASAMU is supposed to be praised for it's story, but I honestly see it more for the puzzles and visuals.; the story is actually pretty lackluster. And the ending, wow, I did not like the ending. So you fly and fall your way all the way through the crazy, difficult-to-navigate, challenging world, dying about 300 times, just for your uncle to tell you he's staying there and he's going to send you home. Honestly, it's so plain and badly planned, I would compare it to the ending of Firewatch. But, unlike Firewatch, this ending more or less to be expected, since nothing was ever built up throughout the game. You just travelled from place to place to find out that your uncle had gone somewhere else.There's a lot of mysteries and questions that go unanswered in this game. Like, what's the point of the weird symbol language? And what was with that weird fish monster thing? And why was there a dead whale on the floor of the ice caves?!? The game left off on a weird note, with the cliche ""and you never saw him again, "" and it kind of makes you question why you played it in the first place.Again, this is not supposed to be a bad review, but it's ending up like that, sorry.So, to wrap this up I'll say, wait for it to go on sale. The game itself is only about 3 hours long, and there isn't much to explore beyond the striaght path so the most you could end up with is proably 4-4.5 hours. If you don't like challenging, limited-range platformers with easy stories, then don't get the game. It's no Tale of Two Brothers, or, hell, Firewatch proabably had a more extensive story, so if your expecting that, then wait for a really really good sale, or just don't get it.But, if you like difficult platforming with amazing graphics and a plot that's only there to give you a reason for your journey, then this game is what you want."

76561198021051057,Recommended,278360,12079588,"Posted: 12 September, 2014",all,Kraft Punk,"""A Story About My Uncle"" is a  decent platformer with some refreshing innovations. The story is charming, the gameplay is original, and the backgrounds are gorgeous.However, the game has some serious flaws. The character models came off as cheap and cartoony and seemed out of place. Up until I encountered one of the frog people I felt pretty immersed in the game... but they kind of pulled me out of it. Also, and this is probably my biggest issue with the game, the difficulty comes off as artificial. I like platformers that require quick reflexes and I also like games that require you to think through puzzles instead of just rushing through. This game unsuccessfully mixes the two. Progressing through the game requires a lot of trial and error. I found myself taking a lot of blind leaps just to see if I could grapple to an object in the distance. Some places that look accessible aren't. Some areas are hard to see and only become obviously visible after messing up a few times. So even after getting through a tough area...it just doesn't feel all that rewarding.Even with these flaws though, there's something about flying through giant glowing caverns that makes the game appealing enough to play. And like I said earlier, the story is quite charming. It's innocent without being childish or trivial. I probably wouldn't recommend it to the average gamer, but for those who enjoy platformers and are looking for something new, I'd say give it a shot."

You meet a few characters, but won't interact with them for more than 5 minutes excludingone particular girl that decides to mount your back.In summary, this game may feel like a grinding session to a lot of the gaming public.

Has a decent story although the voice acting sounds a bit strange, almost like they are 100% native american even though they don't look like it.  The gameplay is pretty cool too.The main thing I have to complain about is this: its so, so, so, so short.  I beat it in about 2 hours and that was with me looking for the secret unlockables too, and standing still while listening to the narrated parts.  It's actually so short that by the time you get good at it and your running and jumping around like a pro, the game is already over.  Not worth the original price since its only 3 hours of gameplay at max.  Unless your into playing it over and over for some reason.  I picked it up for $2.50 on a Winter sale so at that price its worth it."

You can take advantage of a power suit to navigate the five bizarre areas the story will take you to in the roughly four hours of gameplay.The main beef of A Story About My Uncle is indeed Fred's power suit and the various moves you can pull off with it: you can jump to greater heights, sprint, resist great falls, dash in mid-air thanks to a pair of rocket boots and use an energy beam to hook upon certain surfaces and cover large distances. The game makes a good job and introducing the different mechanics gradually and offers a steady increase in challenge as you go on.While the title does have a story of its own (and a rather good one at that) and introduces few characters to you, the interation with the NPCs is minimal (save for two major characters): what really drags A Story About My Uncle is the platforming and the tale is told mainly in-between the various sections. The game primary appeal is the scenary: the environment is especially rich in design and always plentifully detailed, reaching scenary porn more than once.Apart from the main story, you are given a time trial mode and a hunt for collectables around the areas you visit, which unlock mainly cosmetic goodies.A Story About My Uncle is a little gem of a game, both very entertaining to play and plesant to look at that.

A Story About My Uncle is one of those that was literally made for speedrunning and it does have a time trial mode. Searching for the best shortcuts and choosing the best moves to overcome certain obstacles, planning and executing the perfect run is much more exhilirating than the basic gameplay. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you can significantly stretch the 3-5 hour average playtime. On the downside, there's only a handful of maps so you can grow bored with it pretty quickly.Now, I'm rather bad at platforming so it probably took me significantly longer to play through the game than almost everybody else and there were a few times I had trouble navigating myself through the 3D environment as well as a few times when I knew what I had to do but had difficulty executing it. All that sprinting, jumping and basically flying can be very exhilirating but since there isn't any other aspect to the gameplay (except the speedrunning potential), you may feel unmotivated to get through the more difficult/annoying bits. If there were other puzzles and a more extensive (and compelling) story, it would be an epic game. As it is, it feels more like a promo.I probably don't have to mention that this game is simply gorgeous. Yes, the quality of the surroundings and of the NPC models seems rather incongruous but the overall impression doesn't suffer from it much.The story could have been interesting if they developed it a bit more. As it is, I feel it's only there so you wouldn't be swinging through otherwordly caverns just for the hell of it. The storytelling concept has been proven to work before and I find the dialogue between father and daughter rather sweet as opposed to some other people, but I do admit that the voice acting is terrible."

The core mechanic of the game is how you traverse the vast distances you need to navigate by using what looks like a Nintendo Power Glove that functions as a tractor beam hookshot. This is a very fun way to get around, but some segments of the game can be frustrating to get through using this system. The story is serviceable enough, about a boy who is searching for his lost explorer/scientist uncle, using the technology that he left behind. I'm not sure why it was necessary to frame the story as the boy all grown up, telling about his adventure to his daughter, but that works fine, too. I liked playing this but I have to say, this is the only game I have ever played on Steam (that I liked and played through to the end) where I found the great majority of the achievements just not worth getting because the effort just seemed to be not worth the payoff.

You'll fall to your death a lot, but as you get the hang of how the grapple system flows, you'll soon be racing through the air and having a ton of fun.There are a few hiccups; while the story is well told (as simple as it is), the voice acting is mediocre. While I found the gameplay fun overall, there were certainly spots where there simply weren't enough environmental clues to point you in the direction you were supposed to be heading, making for some pointless deaths as you simply inch forwards and learn the path of the route your supposed to take.These are minor gripes, though.

,Recommended,278360,25333334,"Posted: 3 September, 2016",all,King Hanley,"A Story About My Uncle is a game that instantly popped out to me, when looking through the Steam Specials a couple of weeks ago. For $2 CDN, an adventure game with a cool gimmick? Why not?!The game features a suit that allows you to ""swing"" around very open (and beautiful, I might add) environmenta, similar to Spiderman. More features come to the suit later, but I won't go in depth there. The features seem to work very well, even on a controller, where moving your cursor around isn't easy. I found that I was stuck on some parts of some levels, but only because my cursor didn't move fast enough to reach the object with my beam and continue swinging. I'd imagine that this would be at least a little easier with a keyboard and mouse.While this game does have beautiful graphics, very good voice acting, and wonderful gimmicks to keep users playing through the adventure, there are some quirks in this game, which can be fixed:I found that, with the energy crystals that are supposed to refill your beam energy, some of them just didn't work. At all. No matter how close or far I got from them, they would not refill my energy. The option didn't even come up. This lead me to reverse-engineering the game's physics, in lack of a better term, to advance through the game in a way that I'm sure the developers did not intend the game to be beaten.The ability to reach certain objects with your beam from certain distances are also inconsistent. Some objects I can reach when I'm extremely far away from, while other objects, I can't reach when I'm only half as far. This also lead me to just guessing and misusing my abilities, making it harder for me to advance through the game.The ending. No spoilers, but the ending leaves much to be desired. I wish the game would have gone further; really expanded on what was given to the player. I spent around 4 hours on the game, and the game feels unfinished; like it's just a demo. A $13 (but on sale for $2) demo. It really feels like there should have been more to the story part, to at least make the game FEEL longer. After putting through several, strenuous hours of gameplay, you get to your destination, and it's all over. No going back. The added epilogue was nice, but it still doesn't make the ending any better. It just draws out the feeling of ""Is this really it?"", which is very dissapointing.The extras and unlockables are a nice touch to the game. Although I didn't even realize they were a thing until I unlocked the first one. I will most likely go back and scourge the levels again to find the collectibles to unlock the ones I haven't gotten yet.Overall, the game was worth the money for me. A very good proof-of-concept that should have been expanded on at least a little bit more, but was still very fun to play in it's time. I would 100% recommend someone to get this game,, especially if it goes on sale."

If swinging around with an energy beam is your thing, you will love this game.Story Mode Time: Two HoursWelcome To My Review! If you enjoyed, please leave a like and a comment. So sit back, chillax, and enjoy.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay in this game is the most important start of it. It is what makes this game so amazing. The main premise is you are a player who has access to a suit which let's you swing back and forth between a variety of objects. The settings are interesting where you can explore an overwhelming cave, and mountain encassed in ice, and a city designed in floating rocks. This is the best part of the game, moving between platforms to make it to your destination, with a variety of suit upgrades as your progress. Along with the story mode, you are also given a time trial that is actually extremely difficult to get a gold medal, and this will be the main mode that gives this game a longer life span. This simple element of platforming gives the gameplay a 10/10!STORYThe story is where I feel it is lacking. The story starts out with you doing a simple task: searching for your missing uncle who doubles as an adventurer. This is a unique concept as you are literally flung into a world you know nothing about. The only problem I have with the story is that it is lacking in so many places it makes it hard to follow. It leaves a lot of gaps open that don't explain enough to give your a proper sense, and it has a lackluster ending that is more disappointing then anything. I would give it a 6/10, since the little we are given is really fun.GRAPHICSThe games graphics aren't too imporant, but they are nice. The backgrounds of the game are amazing and beautiful, and if you like taking screenshots of games like I do, then you are going to have fun here. The rest of the game is lackluster, however, is bland and I feel this is the only part of the game that I dislike. The player models and animations are very wonky, and it feels like this game could've pushed the graphics and a little further without performance. I would be them a 3/5, since they are bland and boring up close, but the background and looking from the top of a hill is stunning.FINAL SCORE - 19/25 - CThanks for reading! This is a really good game and is a nice one to have in your lobby simply for one playthrough and the trial mode. If you have a few hours to kill, pick this game up!"

The narration, and in fact all voices in this game, are very well done.The game is played using a series of jumps [with jump boosts] and grapples to navigate floating islands. Think of it kind of like mirrors edge with a grappling gun. The level design provides enough of a challenge for the game to not be boring, but not so difficult that it gets in the way of the story. However, If you are after something trickier, then see the achievment list for some harder challenges.I played this game with a keyboard and mouse. The store says it supports controllers, but I seriously wouldn't reccomend even trying that, as this game will require very precise movements that will be impossible unless you are very skilled with a controller.The graphics on the environments are wonderful in this game, and the accompanying soundtrack adds lots to the experience. The vistas in this game are also beautiful, especially the ones where you can see the landscape with the sky in the background. The character design of the ""frog people"" is a bit questionable if you look too closely, but frankly I don't see any way that you could make ""frog people"" look nice. The developers did a good attempt at it, though.I didn't have any trouble installing or running the game, but I did find that in certain areas of the levels, it seems as if the designers didn't realise you could reach there and you kind of ""shift through"" the environment. Luckily, you don't fall all the way through. Most of the game is linear, but in such a way that it looks pretty open, and you wont encounter this problem unless you go right to the edge islands of the levels.The only major gripe I have with this game is that it is very short. I wish they had perhaps extended the story somewhat, rather than ending it where they did, but that doesn't affect my enjoyment of the story that there is in any way. You should buy this game if you like parkour running styles [albeit with a grappling hook], and you'll get a nice story narrated while you play."

Just like any game, there are pros and cons. Let's start with the cons.Cons:1. The game is rather short. I beat it in around 2 hours (just shy of 2 hours).2. Some of the dialogue is a bit rough, but not much of it.3. There are some bugs, and sometimes if you land on something the devs didn't think you would jump on, you can fall through or get stuck. Also, there are a couple invisible walls that you might run into if you jump in the wrong spot (meaning you didn't go where you were supposed to go and you may get stuck or fall).4. The controls were sometimes (very rarely) broken.Pros:1. The story is pretty good. It's no Portal 2, but it has a fun story that I found myself engrossed in.2. The game mechanics of the grapple and the jumping are very smooth 99% of the time. It was extremely enjoyable to jump from platform to platform while swinging from floating rocks.3. The art style felt old, but in a good way. It reminded me of playing a classic playstation game from my childhood. I don't know if this was the intention, but I loved the nostalgia.4. The music was perfect for the environment.5. Each level environment was fun to explore and soar through.and finally, 6.

The controls are excellent and work well. the graphics are ok for what it is the narration is ok and on occasions the vastness of the caverns you explore is impressive. What is fun about this game though is the grappling hook - jump swing and repeat - not really that much else to do - time it right - some of the jumps can be very difficult and took me over 20 attempts to make - but once i knew how to do it it was pretty easy next time - however after a while you will be doing cool jumps first time. some nice simple game mechanics used effectively.this game is very similar to the valley if you liked that then you might like this -

Get it only when there's a discount.If you are into Portal-like platformers, this is a short little game with a cute story for you. You get sort of a grapplinghook and build momentum to swing around platforms. There aren't any puzzles, but there are collectibles if you are into that sort of thing.Maybe the game can be extended by going for a trial mode or going after all collectibles, but even with a little bit of exploring I couldn't get more than 4 hours out of it. There also isn't that much to explore and interact with. Collectibles are always sort of hidden either beneath you or on the side of a distant platform which is easily skippable. There are no enemies in this game. No penalty for dying.The graphics are relatively decent.Narration is very good."

By the time I was nearing the end of the game, I was playing the game for the sake of beating it when I knew I was so close. In hindsight, I wasn't enjoying my time playing the videogame, and in my mind enjoyment ought to be the motivation for playing a videogame.The platforming is a cool concept that I enjoyed at first, but it got very tedious for me, which is saying something for a game that took me under 2.5 hours to complete. There are a few other tools added to the game other then the grapple, but the game really revolves around that one mechanic which is shown in the trailers.As for the story, I didn't find any depth in the one-dimensional characters, and I wasn't a fan of the voice acting. The story overall felt very childish to me, which very well may be the intent-to me this seems like a game geared towards a much younger audience (think 6-8 years old).

You are the father, and your daughter wants to be told a bedtime story. You decide to tell her about your uncle, Fred, and how you followed him into a strange world for an adventure, after Fred had been gone for some time. You find a suit he had made to fit you just right, but never got around to asking you to come on an adventure with him, as he had stayed on his latest adventure for a good while, which is what prompts you to go find him.You meet this species of frog people, later revealed to have been created by your uncle, who accidentally sent them to the world, and that is why he went on an adventure; to retrieve them back, but by the time he had gotten there to collect them, they had already grown. You meet a girl name Madeline (Maddie). She joins you for a while to help find your uncle Fred. She accompanies you for a time, until you find the 'Strays' which were people who originally lived in the village of the frog people, but moved out of the dark, damp caves and moved to a place called 'Star Haven' and created a new, prosperous village. Once you arrive in Star Haven, Maddie decides she wants to stay there with the Strays, and wishes you luck on finding your uncle, but she has one last request; If you do find him, have him go back to visit Maddie in Star Haven.Jump forward a bit, after going through the trecherous Ice Caves, at the end of the final tunnel, you find your Uncle Fred and some of his equipment laying around. He hears the footsteps, and turns around calling out ""Hello?"" to which he is surprised to see you. He comments on how you're wearing his suit, and asks what you're doing there. You comment on how you found it in his Workshop, and came to look for him.Unfortunately, your Uncle wanted you to go back home. You reluctantly agree after wanting to stay there with your Uncle Fred and Maddie, but your uncle insists you go back to the real world and find your adventure there. You step on the pad, and your uncle activates it, which launches you back to your world, out of the cave full of crystals. That was the end of the bedtime story for your daughter.While you don't know what happened to your uncle, you know no matter what, hes on his biggest adventure yet. You go back after telling your daughter your story back to your uncle's house. Things are packed up, cleaned up. There's also a small memorial with a picture of your uncle, who has not returned from his adventure since you came back. You came back every day, ocassionally remembering your uncle's voice asking for you to get him this or that tool. Unfortunately the closet where your suit was is locked up tight, and you can't get in it. You head upstairs to the Observatory one last time to find the pad that originally sent you there presumably still there, but not funcional and covered in snow from the open window.Pros:Amazing, colorful graphics.Music and sound effects that match the atmosphere through the entirety of the game.Interesting storyline.An interesting platforming-challenged game.A sense of freedom.Cons:Voice acting could have been a bit better.Can get repetitive after you die in a certain area over and over (Mostly Ice Caves level)A few tedious levels.The game was actually shorter than I would have liked.I would give A Story About My Uncle an8/10."

It is definitly shorter than most games, but it is worth every penny. The graphics are perfect for what it is. It is not gonna be like a game that came out yesterday kind of graphics, but they are still pleasant to look at. Even though the game is a bit short, you can play it again and find all of the items in a section, to unlock a new feature. For example if you find all the items in one of the sections, you can change the color of the beam on the grappling hook. I have never seen game mechanics quite like this, and the are really fun to use.Once again I have to recognize the story-line. I got the chills during the ending. It helps show the meaning of life, and how you should venture out and try new things.To sum this whole review up, would I buy it again? YES. No doubt. Should you buy it?

,Recommended,278360,29081516,Posted: 7 January,all,A bug in the code,"I purchased this game way back during the Steam Summer Sale of 2015. I played it for about half an hour, put it down, and didn't pick it up again until today (7/1/2017). That said, because I couldn't remember how to play the game, I started from scratch and ran through it in one sitting.To be honest... it's an all right platformer. Far from bad, but not neccessarily great, either. Because of how many buttons you have to press at once, results are pretty inconsistent. The sprint key could have just been removed entirely and the game would have been a lot easier to control. But even then, that's really only half of the problem. You don't really get that much of a margin for error when it comes to distance jumping. There was one level in the middle of the game where I just grew plain frustrated because of how many times I had barely missed the end of the platform I was trying to get to.Of course, the end level was laughably easy in comparison. It's also riddled with unintented ledges where you can sit on and try again halfway through a jump. Where on the previous level, I was stuck and frustrated, this one I eased right through with little to no problems. It made the ending really anti-climatic. There just wasn't anything to make the player feel changed like how there was in previous levels. By the way, there are 5 levels if you count the tutorial level.The artwork for the levels is really pretty and there are more than a few ""Kodak moments"" to be had. It's honestly the highlight of this game. The design and gameplay is really inconsistent and the story was so bland and silly that it was almost pointless. Character conflicts get resolved within a 2 minute bit of dialogue. Conflicts, which you never get any warning or reason with. They just happen and get resolved. And these are not small little conflicts, either. These are life changing conflicts. It would be like if I walked up to a bank and decided in the span of 2 minutes on getting a $50,000 loan for a house.Inconsistent is just such a perfect descriptor for this game. When it works, it's really great. There's a few really great moments in gameplay, but they never great repeated again. The story starts off mysterious and adventurous, but just ends with disappointment and a totally lame with no true closure to the build up that the story starts you with.On sale, I can recommend this game, but at full price, I cannot. This is a 2 hour game and while it is a fun little adventure, the only big positive it has is nice environments and some occasionally fun platforming."

Do not, however, take this to mean that no skill is needed. While I found the game rather easy for the first few levels, no one who has seen the ending would say that it is easy in the final stages. (On a side note, I dare anyone to get the achievement for getting through the last level without ever falling...

The game had stunning views and since it basically revolves around floating islands the game is full of them. Its basically a couple of hours of eye candy.Sound 9/10The sound fits the scenery really well and it creates a relaxed and laid back atmosphere. The ‘safer’ areas with pleasing sceneries have relaxing music the more ’sinister’ areas have more sinister music, the game pulls this off very well. Not much to say, it fits like a gloveStory 6/10The story is a classical tale beginning middle and an end told by a narrator. The reason why i didn’t give it a lower rating on the story is because it feels as if there aren’t many games that have that nowadays.Gameplay 7/10The gameplay revolves around jumping, rocket jumping and grappling. Personally i love all three of those things and they exist in abundance in the game but in principle they are the only things you do. If you do like such mechanics then the game is definitely for you.Characters 6/10The voice acting had a bit lower quality then i expected but was good nonetheless. The issue i have is that aside from the main characters there is literally no interaction with other characters they might as well be objects in the background, like crates or rocks.Overall: 7.5/10The game, depending how you play, is relatively short. I completed it after 4.5 h (i like to explore and take my time) but it  can be completed in less. It has replay potential depending on your preference. If you are a completionist or just enjoy challenges with limiter resources then you will find no problem in replaying the game. The same can be said if you just want to relax and enjoy a good scenery with some exploration potential. Personally I did like the game, but as previosly mentioned it is a bit short aside from that i would recommend it.Price: As for the price, i cant say much since i bought it on a sale and it was only 2€ (definetly worth it)"

Only cons were I could easily get to place i shouldnt, and a little frustrating as sometimes you dont know where you need to go.The graphics were good, I had no issues with it. The characters in the game look a little wonky but its a fantasy genre so I'm not picky about it. The game world itself was gorgeous, I never got tired of it, and at the beginning of every level, I was thrown into another beautiful land.The narrative itself was again, very well voiced, and well written. I have also noticed a metaphor for the entire narrative itself (NO SPOILERS). But if you are someone who enjoys looking for hidden meanings, this game is definitely for you.

Tethering around is loads of fun at the game's more challenging sections, usually rewarding precision and timing more than frantic movement and reflexes. When it loses its appeal, the game adds a new mechanic, and appropriate challenges to go along with it. The game is relatively short, and doesn't have any kind of ""hugely epic"" climax, but I think that's appropriate.It's also one of relatively few 3D games I've seen to make a decent effort at getting lipsyncing and facial expressions to look right.

My only complaint is that the main story it too short for my liking, taking me only 3 hours to beat.  Regardless, I highly recommend getting this game."

The world is very magical and pretty to look at and I didn't really mind the funky graphics, since I'm no ""uh must be realistic HD graphics"" fanatic, but I missed having puzzles or at the very least, some sort of action, of which there is non -- which is kind of a bummer.But yes, I'm giving this a thumbs down because of the story -- I mean, how can you have ""story"" in the title and yet lack exactly that?"

And it's as fun as it sounds, but it gets more and more fun as you advance and discover more abilities to traverse. However, around this core there's also an ultimately enthralling and touching story of what wonders you may encounter as you set off to adventure.... and what you may have reluctantly left behind.At first you'll think it's one of those games where it's only you in a lonesome and desolate place, namely a cave... but as soon as you exit the caves, you'll discover that this world is ALIVE, full of beautiful open vistas and even living people who live there! And that is truly where the story takes off, providing emotional reasons for your adventure and even someone to join you in your exploration. The contrast is breathtaking, and very welcome, although some people may have given up before reaching this point, and they shouldn't have.Like I mentioned, although it starts off with simple swinging abilities, it gets much, much more fun further along, providing you with even more ways to fly across chasms and just have fun advancing. You may end up falling to bottomless chasms more than you'd like, but in the end you'll just enjoy figuring out how to fly across the next set of obstacles and actually making it.All in all, this one is a wonderful adventure well worth setting off to."

And I really wanted to love this game, I really did: colorful, well-designed world, interesting characters, engaging plot and great soundwork. What completely ruined it for me, though, was the gameplay, it's been one frustration after another. There was no pleasure at all in traversing this beautiful world, and every time I found myself trying sections over and over just because jumps and grapples have to be stupidly precise. This gameplay reeks of when 3D platforming was in its infancy, when developers hadn't figured out how to do it well yet and didn't understand that having to make precise jumps in the third dimension needs to allow for much more leeway than in traditional platformers. In this case, the grapple points were often too tiny to be of use, not to mention that the actual controls are way too floaty; the right way to do this is to make sure that the controls are spot on, they're not working against you and the game helps the player in reaching the expected objectives. Maybe it's my fault for playing this with a controller, but some sections were downright impossible to pull off (I actually had to enable fly mode right at the very end, or else I would get an ulcer from this thing; not even kidding). What baffles me the most is that with 40-something testers nobody thought that some sections were too annoying to play, so maybe it really is my fault. I hated it wth all my guts, and I wanted to enjoy it so much."

The script itself is awkward and the voice acting doesn't help. None of the voice acting sounds natural.  The movement of the characters also look rigid and un-natural. The full story just felt uninspired as well; not bad per se but it felt like they just had a vague idea and just built off of it, as is evident with Maggy (one of the three characters in the whole thing) just being a huge stereotype. Overall, the story and all things related to it just make me uncomfortable and detract from the gameplay.So what about the gameplay? ""Eh."" Jumping around and grappling from flying rock thing to flying rock thing is fun. There is no getting around that. The big problem is some of the parts seem oddly unforgiving. Jumping from thing to thing is fun, but once you start falling down again and again... Well it loses that simple style of fun flying around gives you.And although the game is based on exploration, it's super linear. Which isn't too bad until you realize that going off the beaten path just means death. The worst part is they have hidden things in levels to encourage exploration, but once you try to explore that flying mountain you'll realize it's impossible to stand on, once you try to escape the giant creature in the cave by going into the river that's resting under it you'll realize that there was no river. Only lies. And you'll fall through and die.So what is goo about this game? the environments. They're pretty, memorable, and look unique.  I feel like this is the part they put all their effort into (and I mean all of it) and is the sole reason I can't completely bash this game, because I did enjoy looking at all the different areas. I just wish the villiages/towns were more... Fleshed out. They had some stuff that was pretty to look at, but it had no depth.So in conclusion, the story and characters were a let down; the gameplay is frustrating, linear, and frustratingly linear in spite of good ideas; and the environments almost make it worthwhile.This is basically that pretty yet shallow girl you dated that one time, but in video game form."

You must jump, grapple, and rocket boot your way through amazing locations in order to find your Uncle Fred.GraphicsA Story About My Uncle (which I will now on abbreviate to ASAMU) is an extraordinarily beautiful game for a US $12.99 indie title. The worlds/levels you must traverse are outstanding. From dark icy caves to floating islands, the art department at Gone North Games have my complete respect for the way they were able to construct such a beautiful world. The only complaint I have regarding visuals would be the humanoid creatures you encounter (the Villagers and the Strays). Although they don't look too good, they aren't a major part of the game and you can avoid them for the most part if you'd like.Audio & SoundtrackThe soundtrack for ASAMU is for the most part really well done. I quite enjoy the Main Theme of ASAMU as it really sets the tone for the game; an adventure game with a deep sentimental backstory. Most of the music in the ASAMU soundtrack is extremely adventurous enhances the adventure atmosphere of the game. I don't really like the music in the Caves (the first few levels of the game) but the music only improves more and more after you emerge from the dark caves. Overall the music is really well done.The voice acting, however, is in my opinion poorly done. The voice acting for the main character and his daughter were pretty well done and I quite enjoyed listening to their voices. The voices of  pretty ever other character in the game were godawful. I couldn't stand their voices, and I often wished that they would get to the point.GameplayOh my, what do I even say about the gameplay. What I can say from the getgo, however, is that the gameplay of ASAMU had me HOOKED! I absolutely love the feeling of intense freedom and adventure when you grapple and fly through the air across mystical islands and caves. I really enjoy the artificial feeling of zipping through the skies and finding your way across the expansive worlds. ASAMU is a platformer game unlike no other platformer. You have the power of magical crystals at your disposal, allowing you to jump great heights, grapple, and rocket boot your way towards your long-lost uncle. After beating ASAMU, I found myself constantly craving another game to quall my lust for more adventure.My only complaint with the gameplay aspect of the game is that I often get lost in the huge levels. There aren't any markers that point you to where you are supposed to go, so you can find yourself at the start of the level by accident like I did many times.StorylineA Story About My Uncle isn't really a story about the protaganists uncle. It is however, a story about your adventure finding your uncle, an adventurer who found his way into a new world (which is all I'm going to explain without spoiling the story). ASAMU is a rather short game. I managed to beat the game in 2-3 hours with the rest of my time either idling or replaying levels that I really enjoyed. I feel like the story was really hindered by the poor voice acting but the exposition delivered by the main character and his daughter are sufficient in getting the point of the story across. You play as a father retelling the story of him travelling to another world to save his uncle who had been missing for quite some time. Along the way you meet many different people and traverse incredible areas. ASAMU is truly a story to experience if you can get past the voice acting.Final ThoughtsOverall I really enjoyed ASAMU. If you enjoy First Person Platformers or Platformers in general, I think you'd have a blast in ASAMU. The game is rather short and pretty easy to beat, so if you don't have too much time to play then I suggest you try out ASAMU. Although there is no sequel or prequel to ASAMU, you can replay levels to reaquaint yourself with jumping through the skies.Rating:Graphics: 8.4/10Audio: 7.2/10Gameplay: 9.0/10Overall: 8.2/10Enjoy the review?

You grapple onto things in order to find your uncle with the ""help"" of a frog girl and occasionally just walk, that is it. I only made it to a point where it's dark and I have no idea where to go and not one aspect of the game is even remotely encouraging me to keep going. It's just boring now.Edit: I made it past that bit, I just found myself in a dark corner that serves no purpose but still contains a checkpoint. Oh, and it turns out the big scary eye monster in the trailer is just a bit where you have to stand still for a few seconds til it decides to go back to sleep in order to flesh out the playtime a little bit.I imagine this game will go one of two ways, either you'll suck at it in which case it'll just be constant trial and error or you'll be good at it and it'll be over in a couple of hours.I wouldn't go as far as to call this game bad or even not recommend it but once again Steam leave me no choice.

Your abilities include a normal jump, a super jump, an energy grapple you shoot from your hand that can connect to most (but not all!) surfaces and pull you towards them while allowing you to swing after a fashion, and later on, a pair of rocket boosts which give you an abrupt, very large bit of acceleration in a certain direction (yes, as if with a rocket) when you try to double jump in midair.These controls are quite simple, and the game fundamentally consists of using them to traverse environments. You start out only getting one grapple per jump through the air, but soon you end up with the ability to grapple up to three times before landing – and in the final area, refresh them mid-jump by draining glowing crystals on the walls.Sadly, the lack of much variety in mechanics means that, in the end, a lot of puzzles ultimately feel fairly samey – there’s only so much you can do with a limited control set, and it feels like you’ve done it all by the end of the game, and probably more than that. A number of areas feel kind of samey, which isn’t helped by the graphics – while each area of the game has its own unique look, each individual level looks pretty similar internally.This is kind of annoying later on in the game, when it becomes increasingly more difficult at times to see what exactly you’re supposed to be grappling onto – there’s a few points in the game where you have to do a bit of searching to figure out where you’re trying to go next, and it can be less than obvious. Combined with the game’s general aesthetic of “rocks floating in midair/stuck in the sides of a cave over bottomless pits”, the environment can start getting a bit confusing and very same-looking over time.Really, that’s all there is to the game; there’s three or four characters, with decent but slightly off voiceovers that contain the odd grammatical error betraying the writer as a non-native English speaker (or just some poor proofreading), but in the end, I didn’t feel a strong connection to any of the characters. Without this, there’s just the platforming – and that wears thin after a while.Overall, while the game has an okay aesthetic on the most basic of levels, in the end it ends up feeling too samey and there just isn’t anything else there to give it much oomph. It just is what it is, and what it is isn’t anything special. At the end, I was left walking away without feeling like I’d gained anything from the experience, or experienced anything really memorable. It just isn’t worth your time or money."

I can only manage to run it for brief periods of time before it starts to overload my disk drive for reasons unknown, even though all the settings are at their lowest levels. The controls are not always responsive, and often I would find it activating moves when I didn't tell it too. The level design is, overall, dull and the 'puzzle' system is a very lacking, hit-and-miss experience. The voice acting is an extremely mixed bag: for the most part, it sounds like the actors weren't trying or didn't know how they were supposed to feel about their lines, but at times they deliver them on point, with the very last character in the game having flawless voice acting.The game is occassionally fun, but the frustrations involved are plenty and the story just isn't special enough to warrant living through the torment. Overall, 4/10, won't play again."

It should have been good but the devs don't know how to do physics engine programming correctly. The 'hitboxes' are either too small or inconsistent. Too much trial and error is involved to do the jumps which are the central core of the gameplay. Constantly failing by no fault of your own is the death of any game.

But it's still not good.The Gameplay is simple: Think 1st Person Bionic Commando. You will Jump from platform to platform, using a grappling hook to swing or catapult you onto various floating platforms to progress through the level. You are resctricted to using the grapple once, twice, or thrice as you progress. And... that's it. You gain an ability to , for lack of a better word, ""double jump"" as well but it only adds just a little more to the experience.This sort of mechanic can be fun, but not in the challenges they've constructed. This is the kind of thing I can see working well in an open world style game, like some of the older Spiderman games. But alone it gets repetetive. They try to keep things interesting by changing scenery, adding moving obstacles, but you're still just jumping from platform to platform. There are only rare moments where combining a series of swings and mid air jumps has that satisfying ""Nailed it!"" feeling.It's not particularly challenging, and it is challenging it does so in an unfair way. For example, some surfaces you can grapple, and some you can't. The graphical quality is so poor, and environments so dark you'll have a hard time guessing what you can latch on to and what you can't. Later in the game you'll be able to ""recharge"" your grapple mid air by clicking on Blue Crystals. But the hit box is so narrow you'll miss clicking it completely and plunge to yorur death as you accidentally use your last grapple charge on a piece of rock (you need at least one charge to recharge oddly enough).One of the most frustrating parts is when your grapple is just out of range of your intended target and you will frantically click on the surface in question so you can just grab it before it falls away from you again, only to find you've quickly expended 2-3 charges on one surface.Understandably some of the above are 'skill based' problems. That maybe so, but it's also not very fun.Graphically the game is something roughly equivalent to Xbox and Xbox 360 hardware. It's very dated with lots of polyons. Environments generally features lots of contrast, but are also too dark even on recommended brightness setting.There is some kind of story here, but it's really all a McGuffin. The whole idea of the game is you're chasing afer your Uncle? Why? It's not really explained. The narrator's blasse tone has all the suspense of an airport announcer.With 3 strikes in gameplay, story, and presentation I can't recommend this game enough."

,Not Recommended,278360,23076489,"Posted: 18 May, 2016",all,PinkPony,"The premise of this game suggested a focus on travel, which I suppose it delivers, but don't expect any freedom to come with that.A Story About My Uncleis a physics platformer that will have you jumping and swinging from rock to platform over the course of its 3-hour length. However, swinging isn't actually what you'll be doing, despite the game's thumbnail art - rather than tethering to a point, you'll pull yourself directly towards it, hopefully catapaulting yourself to the next platform.Unfortunately, instead of giving you a sense of freedom, the overwhelming feeling here is restriction. Air control(particularly for the high-jump)lasts only a few seconds before you plummet vertically downwards, likely hitting the side of the ledge you were aiming for and sliding off.  The long-jump on the other hand is completely uncontrollable, launching you directly forward with no option to stop or turn, more likely than not throwing you into the abyss. But why jump when you can fly, right?(aside from the section you're challenged to do without the grapple, which took roughly 30 deaths due to the aforementioned controls)Well, grappling is a frustrating art to learn - too close and you'll smack into the rock you grappled to, dropping vertically; too far and you won't have enough momentum to reach the next grapple-point. This gets increasingly frustrating as the game progresses, giving you more and more sucessive 'swings' between platforms. The route you need to take is usually pretty obvious, but with the vast majority of acheivements being 'never fall in a level' and 'use fewer grapples than ___', every failure is a punishment. If you don't care about acheivements, that's fine, but you'll have quickly swung your way through the game without much to show for it.In typical Coffee Stain form, the human(oids) are ugly and the animations are absolutely terrible. When the characters are not looping a short idle pose with their dead, expressionless eyes, they're sliding across the floor at an angle as they run. There is almost no head-tracking, making cutscenes feel staged and impersonal, with NPCs staring straight forward while you can move around freely. They remain on good form with the environments, though.The mechanics are singular, and frankly I was bored of them within the first half an hour. The standard platforming at the beginning is quite fun, with a good sense of movement, and adding the first grapple to that is fine, but you feel less in control. From this point of the game(level 1), you've seen everything it has to offer. You'll be 'swinging' from floating rock to floating platform over and over, getting up to three changes for your grapple, meaning more rocks between platforms. Later on you get a rocket upgrade, but this is only a mid-air long-jump, and will make you feel even more powerless when you miss your target by an inch.Frankly the game does not stand up on mechanics alone, despite its short playtime. The story is enough to explain progression and told though the compelling, if unoriginal, method of narration via story-telling. However, with ugly characters, stilted voice acting(though the primary narrator is fine), boring and repetative mechanics, short length, and acheivements that are almost exclusively ""don't fail once or start again"", this game falls very short of the price they are asking.If a short game about catapulting yourself from rock to rock sounds fun, then you won't be dissapointed. I, unfortunately, was."

It also becomes clear that exploration, or even just deviation from an intended path isn't planned, when interacting with objects away from that path is even more inconsistent, or you just start glitching through them.

The game is a fantastic first person platformer.Now, I know what you're thinking: ""But first person platformers are usually awful! They're hard to control and land, and in general don't feel as good as sidescrollers!""This game blows that assumption out of the water. The controls feel great, the atmosphere feels great, and the ability to move around freely feels great!Overall, the game starts out with a bit of a Portal-meets-Dear-Esther vibe, in that it starts out with a paced narrative in a beautiful world, which follows through seamlessly into the actual puzzle game where you use some out-of-this-world technology to think quickly in ways you hadn't thought to before, allowingThe game does have a few issues here and there. First of all, there is a small problem with depth perception. Granted, that's going to happen in a first person platformer, but sometimes all it does is net frustration. Then again, that does tend to happen more often than not in a puzzle game designed to legitimately challenge you. In the end, that frustration can lead to some wonderful moments of, ""Oh thank god I finally got that.""However, one MAJOR issue I have with this game was one point where I had just barely almost made it to the next platform before falling off. The game shoved a hint in my face, then cheated me onto the ledge. I understand why they might do that, but I felt cheated in that the game basically took the controller from me and said, ""Okay, we'll just spawn you there."" I didn't feel that I earned it.Another issue ends up being character design. Some of the characters feel... awkward. While this is reasonable seeing as what they are (you'll understand), they didn't feel like living characters in a real world; they felt like VIDEO GAME NPC #37. Especially the few ended up talking to you, whose heads would spin around in order to keep their eyes on you, their necks snapping back and forth should you walk behind them. Granted, you could have it a number of other ways, all with their own flaws, but it takes you out of the experience of the game when that happens. Of course, the exception to this is the character Maddie; it felt like the developers spent time and effort in animating her every expression and motion, and she felt much more alive than any other character.The attitude the game takes towards you wavers as well. In the beginning the game is chocked with wonderful experiences and delightful gameplay, but about halfway through, I felt the game calling back to my early childhood games, where, if you were lost, the game would whistle at you and point you in the right direction. Simply put, I felt like I was stuck in a game intended for children 8-12. I would have been fine with that, had the game decided to stick with that emotion; the challenge of the game seems higher than that needed for an 8-12 year-old child. Maybe I'm just overestimating the skill required to play this game, or underestimating the skill of a kid, but the two just don't feel like they match up. (Or maybe I'm just bad at vidya gaemz.)Despite all of this, the game does do what's most important for a game to do: Introduce a skill/challenge, teach you how to use/overcome that skill/challenge, then apply that skill/ability/challenge to future situations in combination with the previous skills/challenges.*SPOILERS AHEAD*--This section touches a bit more on what I found wrong with the game, but requires describing aspects of the game that would be considered spoilers. You have been warned.--When I had mentioned depth perception being a problem, I also had issues with the grappling hook. Sometimes, something would seem close enough to grapple, but the crosshair wouldn't light, meaning that you have to restart and try again, because maybe you just weren't close enough, or maybe you're going for the wrong rock entirely. A perfect example is the area just after  you leave the village: you head out, and jump across to some huge rock. You attempt to grapple it over and over, and for whatever reason, your crosshair won't like up, and won't hit it. You figure, ""Oh, that must just be the problem with the distance."" However, later on, you come across a rock which is undeniably further than the aforementioned one, and yet the crosshair lights up when aimed over it. It could have just been a matter of perspective, but over all, it tended to confuse me.Again, the characters seem awkward. I understand, they're frog-people, but... if you're going to do that, do it right. Maddie was perfect, in that she appeared significantly inhuman, but still behaved in very human ways. At no point did I think, ""Oh, she's just an NPC integral to the plot."" Every moment I was with her, she felt alive and existant. She felt like a person! In contrast, almost every one of the villagers felt... dead. Sure, they were whistling, they were dancing around, they were lounging, but all in all, they didn't feel alive.Despite all of this, the game still feels fantastic. When you're swinging flawlessly from rock to rock, when you take a huge leap and get a resounding ""THUD!"" on landing, when you climb your way around the map with every tool you have, you feel... free."

Do you wish there was a game of nothing but that?  Do you actually think GW2's jumping puzzles require a little too much thought? Then buy this game.  Otherwise, buy at your own risk.My biggest complaint about the game is that the jumping puzzles, (which is all this game is, btw) don't really feel like ""puzzles.""  It's not about finding the correct route to go in an environment - there's only one linear path, through pretty much the whole game. The puzzle part comes into play when you realize you have to jump at JUST the right angle, swing to JUST the right arc, let go at JUST the right time. That's not a puzzle. That's just a bunch of linear jumping that's annoyingly hard... And that's not fun.I almost rage quit on three different occasions, but didn't because, to my suprise, I wanted to know how the story ended.  The story ended pretty much exactly how I expected it to end - no shocking twists - but I was still happy to finish it.  I want to say it's a bland story, but I cared (tho I don't know why), so I guess it wasn't.The environments / scenery are very pretty.  It's all floating rocks and gaping holes, but they're very PRETTY floating rocks and gaping holes. And you'll die often enough that you'll have plenty of time to admire the scenery.  It took me four deaths to notice the washed up whale, but the game made sure I kept dying until I friggin' noticed it. (Which was a nice break of levity from the repetitive death-thing.)The game is also strangely forgiving AND sadistic.  Dunno if I've explain this well enough or not, but you will die.  A lot.  And I thought it was really nice of Coffee Stain Studios to not draw out the death scene. No screaming or thrashing arms at the empty unforgiving space through which you are plummeting. Not even punishing death music.  Just, ""Oops, I missed"" and then you fall; cue quick fade out, you're back at your checkpoint.  Which is another thing the game was very kind about: checkpoints. There are LOTS and LOTS of checkpoints. Don't think that makes the game too easy, tho. Those checkpoints are there because you need them. Because, did I mention this?, you will die. A LOT. For stupid reasons, no good reasons, because friggin' MADDIE challenges you to something stupid that kills you both. You know, lots of reasons to die. Only one way, but lots of reasons.The music adds well to the atmosphere of the games and works well with the scenery.The characters aren't very high-speed in the graphics or voice acting departments, but it doesn't matter and won't detract.The only complaints I have about the gameplay are platform edges and grappling issues.  The game seems to have a problem dealing with the edges of platforms. If I'm cutting a jump close, sometimes I will land on them, sometimes I will fall right past them. If I'm standing on an edge, I can't WALK forward and must JUMP towards the center of the platform instead. And if your line-of-grappling (that's the science term for it, really) runs through a platform's edge, it's anyone's guess whether or not the game's gonna let you get away with it.Similarly, I had problems with the grappling hook and crystals.Often, while swinging through the air, I would try shooting a crystal clump to recharge my hook and it wouldn't register, at which point I would go plummeting to my death. It led to MANY frustrating deaths.Overall, I give this game a 7/10 because for what it does, it does pretty well.  Points off for its limited definition of the word ""puzzle."" I absolutely do not recommend because it wasn't fun, and unless you're looking for a game of jumping from one obvious platform to another (and nothing else), you probably won't have fun playing it either."

I breezed through it while still enjoying the game play, scenery and music. After beating it of course, unlocked me Time Trials. From what I'm seeing to give the game some challenge is that you need to read up on the Achievements, such as using a certain amount of grapples throughout the whole stage. It's a relaxing game, has a straight-forward path (can get confusing at times, so you need to check your surroundings). The game resembles closely to Mirrors Edge and it's perspective. There are a certain amount of secrets per level (basically standing in front to rip the telegraph paper), and unlocking them gives you alternative bonuses in the options such as changing the color of your grapple. The grappling hook was something you needed to get used to, in terms of velocity, angle, reaction, and momentum. It is a unique game, but I wish there was more to it; A longer story-line to say, a stronger feel and connection with characters that gives you a sense of depth and what the main character is going through as he's trying to find his uncle as he dwells deeper into this adventure.Game-play/Visual: 8/10Music/Portrayal: 7/10Story/Feel: 5/10Price: 3/10 (It feels more of a $4.99 ranged game)Overall: 6/10"

It's hard to tell where you are actually going to land and I died repeatedly just because I thought I was centered up over a ledge to find that I was just a little bit off. I stopped at the part where you have to figure out where to go while turning on lights, that go off soon after you turn them on, in a totally black cave thing and trying to find the ledge to stand on while simultaneously targetting the next place you are supposed to grapple to and find the next light source to turn on. Walked off of the path more times than I can count because YOU HAVE NO FEET to use to tell whether or not you are centered up on whatever it is that you are walking across. I don't mind trying something time and again if I know what I am supposed to do and I am failing at it but this game has no direction markers of any kind and I fell to my death more times than not because I ever so slightly walked off the edge of a small path no wider than a foot, respectively, based off of the size of the character's disembodied arm.I was exilerated at first, the high jumps, the strange world, the bright colors, all very fetching and then the game actually started.. I was quickly annoyed by the grapples to the little floating rocks and the lack of any way to know if you are close enough to grapple onto them or not. Not to mention on many occassions I went to a rock that I thooough was the next one in the succession but alas, no, it was not and seeing as I was out of charges with my grappling hook and it wouldn't recharge, because I had gone the wrong way, I was stuck there, forever.. or until I committed suicide or quit and repawned.Undoubtedly I didn't make it all that far into the game but that's because within thirty minutes of dying over and over and over it was seriously trying my patience and I wanted to scream and throw my computer out the window. If you like an unfair challenge from a game that is too short, according to all the other reviews I have been reading, and mechanics that are rather clunky and unpolished then this is the one for you.On a side note, I made a specific category just for this game, this game is the only one in the category and I have yet to find another that annoyed and frustrated me to the extent that this game did so I don't think it will be getting any company anytime soon, the name of this category is: WHAT THE ACTUAL F*CK??????That is all."

The puzzles become increasingly frustrating and poorly planned out, the story development all but stops in its tracks, and any drive you may have had to finish the game dies, frozen to death in an infinitely tedious, perfectly homogeneous icy wasteland as you wonder: who thought it was a good idea to pad out the game's playtime with this absolutely meaningless garbage?

,Not Recommended,278360,19869685,"Posted: 23 December, 2015",all,Geeky Meerkat,"The game has an interesting story, but I feel like the control scheme is poorly done. Enough so that I find it distracts from just enjoying the game. To explain, you have a sprint button, a jump button, a super jump button, and a grapple button. Super jump takes a couple moments to charge so you have to hold it down for a bit or it does nothing. The regular jump button makes you jump the moment you press it but it's not a huge jump, and doesn't seem to do anything if you hold it down. It just feels like to me that the jump buttons should have been combined into one. Tap the button to do a basic jump, and hold it down to do a super jump.Furthermore, the regular jump is A on a controller something I feel is very intuitive, but the super jump button is the top right trigger and the sprint button is the top left trigger. Grapple is the bottom right trigger. It just feels wrong that the super jump feels like the jump I'll most likely be using most the time but is also a button that is pressed with the same finger as the grapple button. But it's not like I can just switch the controller layout so that the super jump button is the A button, because you still need the regular jump for hoping over little things.Perhaps for some the control set up seems natural and fluid, and they go running around jumping and grappling onto things like in the trailer. But for me it feels counter intuitive and instead of feeling like I'm gracefully jumping through the sky I'm instead having to think about exactly what buttons I want to press to do something.With a game like this, I feel it VERY important that the control set up feel instinctual, and I feel it fails in this. Sadly Steam only lets me either recommend or not recommend a game, so I have to go with not recommend. I trust though that if you've reached this point in reading the review though that you understand my primary complaint is the control set up. If you are all right with games with strange controls or you don't feel that the set up described sounds strange, perhaps this game is for you."

I think the think that distinguishes this from a game I would wholly recommend is that there are parts that are so frustrating it ceases to be fun, and also because the game did not meet my (admittedly high) expectations. What I mean to say is it is good, but could be a lot better.Let me start out with the good things:-The scenery! I love it. The game's landscape is eye candy.-You get to meet some cute frog aliens.-There is a cool ""boss"" level.-The framing device of a man telling his daughter a bedtime story works well. I got some good Narnia vibes. Prepare yourself for a wonderful adventure!-There is something exhilerating about the gameplay, the jumping and swinging around like Spiderman or something. It's lovely.-Gets challenging.-Some cute easter eggs, example: a gameboy with ""A Story About My Uncle"" title screen.Now, the bad:-Pretty short.-A lot of bugs, getting caught in the terrain in some places, or the grapple being juuuust too close to the edge of a platform, causing you to get caught and sort of wiggle endlessly in front of the platform instead of landing on the top of it (giving you no choice but to let go and fall to your death).-While I appreciate that there isn't some kind of ""locking"" system in place with the grapple, because the gameplay really is exciting and challenging the way it is, the game punishes you a lot if your aim is even just a liiittle off, which is a shame, because it eventually gets frustrating.-You are going to fall a lot.-There are areas where there are not enough checkpoints.-Voice acting is not bad, but definitely not stellar.-Small nitpick, but outside of what you need to do to progress there is very very little you can do to interact with the environment.-They go overboard with the easter eggs at some points and it kind of broke immersion for me. It's been a while since I played but I believe there was a My Little Pony reference, a Game of Thrones Reference, and a Breaking Bad reference. None of them adding anything to the experience.Conclusion: Definitely buy it if it goes on sale! But don't get your expectations too high (like I did) because you'll probably be disappointed."

And then you just continuously run threw obstacle course like areas with pit falls that restart you back at the previous checkpoint when you slightly miss a grappling onto the next item and fall in water. The scenery makes it even harder to see the next point that you can grapple onto because it's so dark.This game really didn't do it for me. I was surprised too because it has so many positive reviews. I got a refund for this one.

The voice-acting is genuinely awful, and while that's certainly not unique among indie games, since so much of the narrative is expressed through voice-over, I found myself actively trying to avoid having to hear the characters talk.  Also, for a game that's as timing-based and trial-and-error as this, the fact that there's no way to quickly restart to a checkpoint when you know that you've screwed up (yes, you can pause and click the option, but that doesn't feel quite the same) means that oftentimes I was left waiting for several seconds for my character to fall to his death, which only added to the frustration of how finnicky the swinging can be sometimes.I bought this game for a dollar and I was still disappointed."

The story is almost nonexistent and there's no soundtrack to keep you fixed to the objective. Really, I was expecting at least SOME storyline to this game, but I can't find enough of one to enjoy this game.END GAME:Now that I've finished the game I can write a full review on it. The gameplay is largely repetetive with little in the way of new puzzles or new terrain styles. The objective is sometimes very difficult to see and even harder to reach. The difficulty of this game is for well-skilled gamers, which conflicts with the story. The story is something really best suited for a kid in single digits, and most kids that age don't have the skills necessary to complete this game. More than that, most kids that age play on consoles and not Steam."

From the reviews i expected a game where you just run and fly and soar through the air, endlessly free, but what i got was basically a well animated ""falling of a cliff simulator"".anyway, I´ll list pros and cons as far as I played:PRO:-it looks nice-great atmosphere-the Idea-lots of checkpoints-lots of funny little details to be foundCON:-if you don´t do it ABSOLUTELY EXACTLY one hundred percent the way they ment it, have fun falling of a cliff.-slightly bumping into rocks sends you bouncing off them in a way that gets you falling off cliffs.-if grappled to a moving object and you look the wrong way for a second, you guessed it, you fall off a cliff.Result: I find the game immensly difficult to master and to play.

The only problems I have with this game are replayability and game length. The main story finishes in only a couple hours if you are going slowly and there are various points where the game forces you to walk slowly and none of the conversations can be skipped no matter how many times you hear it. Naturally, that makes replaying the game very tedious.Due to the length of the game (~ 2 hrs with mistakes made) and the unskippable cutscenes ruining its replay value I cannot recommend this game unless it is on steep discount."

,Not Recommended,278360,16487697,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,LagMasterSam,"This game had an enormous amount of potential. The basic grappling and movement mechanics are amazing, but the game feels severely rushed and cut short. The early stages have excellent pacing and aesthetics with clever variations on using the grappling and movement mechanics. There is even a fun ""boss fight"" near the beginning that requires timing your movement so you aren't seen by the boss. But inexplicably (other than the game being rushed), there are no other boss fights in the game. There is a fun endlessly-falling-platforms section, but I don't consider that a ""boss fight"" since there really should have been other sections like it with some variation.The rushing becomes increasingly apparent as the game wears on because you mostly end up either repeating more of the same tricks or doing the same thing but with more difficulty. Requiring the same tricks with increasing difficulty is not necessarily bad but it should be interspersed with new ideas and other content. The end game just becomes a grind of doing tricks without much exploration beyond finding the necessary surfaces.The end game also suffers from what appears to be a lack of design and testing. Sometimes you can easily and obviously skip things that would otherwise be difficult. Yet other times you have to go through a rapid and convoluted series of precise actions to just barely reach the target.The game is also very short. I wasn't in a particular hurry, yet I beat the game in 2.7 hours. If the game were longer, and the quality from the early game carried over to the end game, I would recommend the game. However, I can't recommend the game as it is."

If play multiple times you'll find yourself doing a different method to beat the same level each time. Warning you now, it can be frustrating at some points, I also recommend lowering the resolution once you get to the Ice Caves if you have a lower-end pc.Story-It's well made, but almost not at the same time. I mean, the title is literally all the game is about. Personally, I find it to be way too ""Disney"", but the game is probably E for everyone. Done in a ""Princess Bride"" style, where you - the dad - tell your daughter A Story About Your Uncle. The voice acting can be a little edgy, and there are a few dialogue mistakes, but this beautiful, heart-warming tale makes up for its flaws. All in all I give it a 4/5.Score- 11.5/15Overall Personal Rating- 4/5 It's still a great game, especially for a small dev team that also made the joke 'Goat Simulator'Please, if find your self unable to beat the game, whether it be uncontollable rage or lack of skill, watch the ending.

Tired from scrolling through thousand zombie killers, sandboxes, amnesia-style-horrors and pixel roguelikes, I bumped into this and pressed ""Install"" button thinking that finally I've been recommended something good. And my expectations were met.""A story about my uncle"" is really beautiful game with lovely music, characters, locations. It only took me 2 or 3 hours to walk it through, but they were worth every second. I saw people call it ""Peter Pan simulator"" - can agree with it and can say, that I had many dreams in my life when I flied like I did in game. Most interesting thing for me were the locations - each level is unique and made me feel different, so I can say level designers and the artists have done their work perfectly.Few things I didn't like:1. Wish the game was longer.2. Wish the epilogue was warmer as the latest feeling really matters and in my opinion it should be more cosy.3. I had huge FPS drop somewhere in icy caverns near the end. I restarted the game and it continued fine.Besides of the above 3 points this game is really worth each cent I've payed and each second I spent on it - beautiful atmospheric locations, music, gameplay and the story made me feel like I was there and just returned from this magical journey.

Yes, this game has great platforming, but in between those are unskippable, slow story areas where they seem to relish in the time they are wasting. There is also some areas where you waste time waiting for rocks to get to the right area. You can move around, but no jumping, slow movement, and you're unable to use your suit in any way. There is also an area where you hae to get past a giant eye, which opens and looks around the area every, give or take, 20 seconds. You essentially have to go to a platform, wait for the eye to open and close again (which takes about 10 seconds) and then rince and repeat.IN CONCLUSIONI feel this game would of been better as a faster game, which it is for most of the platforming areas. But slow story areas, and bad level design just make this game not too fun to play.That's my opinion, anyway."

I heard that Coffee Stain Studios took part in this, so I decided to check it out and I was expecting no less than a goatsimulator-esque gameplay experience. I was god damn wrong and I couldn't be happier about it. The visuals were stunning and it was fun. Swinging around the map with this ""ancient grappling hook"" really makes you feel empowered and it promised a movement-based gameplay like no other, and best of all, it delivered. The story and the narration works so well I was so invested on what happens next, right after I slingshot my way across the map. I really wonder what happened to his uncle. It was an experience 10/10."

I didn't like this game.I can say I liked the core mechanic, swinging from rock to rock was nice , but it also really gets old after a while.The swinging isn't used in any meaningful way like solving puzzles, it's extremely linear in that regard with only a few options to deviate from the track. The swinging is very annoying at times, and falling to your death is something you'll be well acquainted with.The writing is sub-par, with simple grammatical mistakes somehow slipping through into the final product. None of the characters were endearing or likeable, with Maddie being the worst. The wonky animations and bad voice acting certainly didn't help either.I can respect the game for wanting to be peaceful and non-violent, but there really needed to be something else in there to liven up the gameplay. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game, and I feel like the mechanic would have been better suited a puzzle game or something that requires thoughtfulness instead of just reflexes."
,Not Recommended,278360,24509253,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,William Henry,"Really wanted to like the game, but the platforming and grappling hook is just way too frustrating. It doesn't seem to follow it's own internal logic for when you can grapple to something and when you can't. After trying a platforming section with spinning windmills about 50 times, I still had no idea why I could grapple to the windmill about one out of every five tries. I wasn't doing anything different on each attempt, yet it would only grapple to the windmill 20% of the time. I was definitely close enough to grapple and the windmills even had the icon that indicates something you can grapple to, yet, it still only worked 20% of the time.When you have to grapple multiple objects in a row to get to the next platform, about half of my attempts would fail because the grapple would pull me too close to the object I am attached to and throw me off course or stop my momemtum entirely. I get that the grapple will pull you all the way to whatever you're connected to, but they really should have implememented a system so it would know when you are trying to swing from an object and when you are trying to land on an object.There really should be a Super Meat Boy or Trials instant restart as well. The platforming is frustrating enough, but having to wait upwards of ten seconds for the game to reload every time you fail is just way too long. I lose interest and it would make me want to quit playing even more than I already did.I really liked the art style and the story seemed at least somewhat interesting, but the frustrating, endless platforming is just too much for me to keep playing or recommend to anyone."

It was really for an afternoon's session. The visuals are really impressive for an indie game like this,  the soundtrack is simple but works well, and there's tons of fun easter eggs hidden throughout the play. The travel and exploration mechanic is great too, but at the end of the day it just feels like a ""proof of concept"" game.The mechanics work, but I found myself falling more than progressing over the course of the 3-4 hour game. Some of the running and jumping controls work, some of them don't, and not being able to cusomize it for a keyboard feels like a bit of an oversight. The ability to grapple onto pretty much any surface was really impressive, and would have been a really good selling point for me if I wasn't getting stuck in-between rocks and being forced to fall back to the save point over and over. Plus the game is VERY liner, which is disappointed given the posiblilites to explore that you start to see after the first hour.There is a bit of story to the game, which being called ""A Story About My Uncle"" (a rather poor title if I may say so) but I was expecting a bit more depth to it. You get a bit of narration as you go, but if anything it seems very dry and unenthusiasitc. Story wise it just doesn't rope me in. There are tons of NPCs, but they don't do anything besides just sit or stand in one place. For that reason the world seems pretty empty. For a game with such strong visuals it's really ashame there wasn't more thought placed into the characters.Again this is far from a bad game, but it just feels too short and too plain of a world to be worth it. Just when I was really starting to get into the game it ended, and I felt like a wasted my money (even if it was on sale).In the long run I think this game would be GREAT with VR, but as is...it's a ""proof of concept"" and not enough to call a good game."

Music is nice too.The plateform part is also very well done, you progressively gain new capacities renewing the challenge of the stages will keeping it simple and intuitive. The controls are a charm which i would consider essential in a plateformer. The sensation of freedom of movement the special suit is supposed to give is very well translated.The difficulty is very well managed from very easy and really leaving you the space to explore what you can do to actually pretty challenging parts towards the end.Nothing to say about the lenght, it's right, i would have wanted more but it is very honest and coherent as is.

The trailers weren't exactly gripping, and I wasn't aware that there was much more to it than just some parkour. There's a world, here, though. An intricately crafted one, full of surprises. And a narrative with the kind of warmth you'd expect only from a talented author. It's foreign and exotic enough that it may throw those with limited tastes off, but I found it an incredibly comfortable experience.In a world where everything is about dramatic, stone-faced grimdark brain rot, overly dramatic negativity, nihilism, or just being a sociopath/murderhobo? This is a bit different. How often does your entertainment make you smile? That's the magic, here, and it's what I look for in my games. When I think of games that have made me smile, I look back on titles like Portal 2, Ori & The Blind Forest, and Gone Home. Yes, very separate titles, but with everyone straining themselves so hard to be Mature (not mature, that's something entirely different, and more in line with this game, interestingly enough) that they probably look like they have constipation?It's different. It's nice. It's a representation of what you should like about humanity. It's creative, it takes your inner child by the hand and drags it through a world of wonderment and awe. If you're like me and this world hasn't chewed up and spat out every last shred of humanity you have, you'll smile. You'll smile a lot. And you'll be happy.It's worth it, just for that.This isn't your usual game, no. If I had to describe the mechanics as anything it's probably Mirror's Edge by way of Spider-Man with a sprinkling of Portal 2. Considering how much I enjoy that method of travel, I had a blast. It's got that sort of pull to it, the desire to explore the experience, understand it, and master it. It's thoroughly engaging, but not in aheart pounding, adrenaline-soaked, blood pumped, testosterone-laden x-tremesort of way. It's oddly more cerebral than that. Yes, it requires reflexes, but it also dares to challenge you to think a bit, and that's where I feel the mild Portal 2 sprinklings flavouring it. It's a joy to justbein.You'll like it, it's as simple as that. Unless you're a cynical beast, devoid of any emotion, and you actually enjoy every story being nihilist with a miserable ending, filled with suffering? You'll love it. I mean, I'm not that. And since I'm not that I end up just rolling my eyes at most of the 'entertainment' out there. You'd think we were all crazy, backstabbing sociopaths. It's cathartic to have something like this, something that's just this different.It's a story. It's agoodstory. It's a story... told well, to a child, about wandering through an alien world in power armour that grants super powers.It's the story your inner child has longed to hear."

Onto the cons.1. The character models don't look and act very natural, not even the one and only human character - your uncle - can escape from this. Looking at them just sends chills down my spine.2. The story is a mixed bag.Up until Maddie and I arrive at the village, it still has quite a natural pace, however everything afterwards is downhill. She suddenly wants to say goodbye with me, even though she has good reasons, it still feels abrupt. And at the end, after you meet your uncle, you are told to leave without your uncle. The epilogue is touching, but still doesn't make up for the fact that you leave immediately. Oh, and that cave you visited earlier? Nope, you're not going back there.What did the two-hour story build up to? Hint: It isn't satisfaction.At full price, $13 is just too much to ask for.

,Not Recommended,278360,13707913,"Posted: 29 December, 2014",all,Cyril,"Sigh. This is a game that I'm just... really disappointed in. It's not even that bad, it's only just in the negative category, but I can't really say I enjoyed it enough to give it a positive.Mostly, the game is just... confused, a lot of the time. Baffling game design choices like forced cutscenes in most levels with no way to skip them, which would be fine if you were only playing levels once, but the game encourages replayability with two achievements per level as well as three more achievements spread across all five. This is most problematic in stages 2 especially as well as 3 and minorly in 4, but it's a really huge oversight in my personal opinion; even just replaying the levels normally, some of these cutscenes drag too long a second time through.The game also can't decide if it wants to be a challenging platformer or a story-based game with gameplay filling in the gaps. The aforementioned achievements plus the levels being generally designed okay enough seem to make it more on the gameplay side of things, but then there's weird stuff like rough terrain, random atmospheric objects that only serve to get in the way, and a lot of other things that throw a wrench in that whole level design thing. Plus, the abundance of cutscenes does abruptly halt the flow of the game far too often.There's also some kind of cruddy level design choices at times. Most of the time you won't have to be too perfect with your momentum to land a jump, so when the few instances where you do have to be relatively precise come up they become infuriating quickly (especially with the challenges for each level, often forcing you to have to restart and subsequently rewatch cutscenes each time). The level length is also horribly imbalanced, with the first three levels combined being shorter than the fifth level (and the fourth being twice as long as any of the three before it). This isn't just a rough judgment either, just going by the speedrun times for each level. Which also vary in leniency; of the ones I attempted, the first level's was oddly strict, while the second and fourth level's not so much. The first two levels have a high reliance on cycles, as well, which are very anti-speedrun (oddly enough this mostly vanishes for the last few levels though...)The real breaking point for me though is just how inconsistently the game behaves. The physics and controls don't feel consistent enough. Long jumps have varying distance some of the time, occasionally one will be much shorter for no apparent reason. Other jumps have weird momentum, sometimes I'll have enough speed in a jump, other times I won't; regardless of whether or not I was running prior to the jump. Occasionally the sense of scale is also screwed up such that something that looks like you can grapple onto it is actually farther away than it looks (stage 4 has this in spades, for whatever reason). Plenty of times the controls just outright fail, too. I'll start a jump charge but it won't work. I'll try to long jump but I got a high jump instead, even though I didn't let go of the run button. I'll try to long jump and not jump at all somehow??? The lack of consistency is what really kills the replayability factor for me here, it's not fun to replay because I'm never sure when I'll get screwed over by something not behaving properly.So then, the game is probably fine as a casual experience. If you plan to play through it once and then never touch it again, most of these problems are utterly irrelevant to you. That's fine. However, it's not a particularly lengthy game and I'd expect the average player to clear the entire story in 2-3 hours, and the asking price is a bit high for that amount of gameplay. Get it on sale if you want to play it that way and you'll probably have a fun enough time. For the people who want to replay and get achievements, you'll probably get your money's worth a lot better, but the cracks in the game really show when it's played this way and make it an unpleasant experience. The latter is the experience I've had and it has pretty thoroughly convinced me that I dislike this game. It can be fun when nothing goes wrong, but I can't trust it enough for it to stay fun. I think with a little more polish and a few aletered levels this could be a really good, fun game, but as it stands it's not quite there yet, in my personal opinion."

Whether it's an ice cave or airships and floating islands, every scene is detailed and breath-taking. The movement in the game is also quite unique; closest to anything I've ever played similar to it would be web-slinging with Spider-Man.That said, there's little sense of free exploration: most caverns or spans appear to have only one way to cross them. Occasionally, when I would find (what SEEMED to be) alternate ways to get across a tricky expanse by landing solidly on an unconventional spot, my grapple and rockets wouldn't recharge because apparently that wasn't the way the developers intended for me to solve that particular problem.Voice acting (at least for English) is subpar. The narrator is telling a bedtime story to his daughter, and nearly put ME to sleep with his monotonous drone. Also, that was his daughter?! Until he said so near the end, I thought the whiny little quasi-British schoolboy was, well, a BOY. And as beautiful as the music on the menu page is, I was expecting similar scores throughout the game; unfortunately, most of the game was without soundtrack.But the real frustration with this game is the checkpoint system, as though it's a throwback to early 90s gaming. There's no saving your progress when YOU want to save the game: there are only scattered checkpoints which also serve as somewhat-helpful directional markers. Some sections require crossing two or three tricky spans before reaching the next waypoint, and if you fail, you'll have to go back to the checkpoint and do them all again. And again. And AGAIN.I tend to try to get all the achievements I can in games, but when I finished my playthrough (less than 8 hours of total gameplay; my ""hours played"" is artificially inflated by having left the game on pause overnight and through work the next day) and checked the available Achievements, I LOL'd at the thought of counting how many times I used the grapple tool through an entire segment to try to stay under par, then restarting the whole thing again if I went over...No. Just... no.Bottom line: Meh. I paid less than $3 for it, so I don't feel cheated, but I'm definitely not going to waste any more time on it."

Also would be much more natural to move around instead of feeling a bit awkward at times-In the last map there are stalactites and there is pretty much just one chance to do it right, you fail you need to die to try it again-History a bit shortAnd now the strong parts of the game:+Decent graphics, the engine can do it better but no complains, I really ain't a graphic b**** so..+A unique kind of adventure you get to live it through FPS perspective, which can feel refreshing+The collectibles are well hidden, so if you like the ""work to find it"" or just carved by old school games, this is a feature you can enjoy+The unlockables that you get through the collectibles are nice (you can change the color of the beam and some other functionallities)+The narration is amazing, my round of applause to the narrator. Really great voice to the roll he plays in the game.+Beautiful sub-real fantasy like environmentsOverall, if you can get to pick it at like 5 dollars I think it kinda worth it, if I could know all the gameplay from before hand I woud perhaps not have bought it but oh well, didnt spend much money so, I'm ok (this comment is mostly cause the dollar on Argentina isn't exactly cheap, so I feel everything I buy must REALLY worth it)"

The main issues I had were it's linear gameplay, forced ideas, and shortness.The game to me seemed too straight-forward for the concept they were presenting. There were not external paths or alternatives you could do. I really enjoyed the Ice level most of all because that one had much more creativity and the paths were a little more open.Moving onto what I mean by saying some things were ""forced,"" I feel like there was very little character development. The character I felt most attached to was actually the narator's daughter. Maddie was an extremely forced character in herself. The idea of how she was shunned for her creativity and intelligence is something we've seen done a lot, and it felt like it was just crammed in there. The connection with the uncle was kind of cut short. I wanted to hear more about his relationship with his nephew, but we only really have 1 memory and that's the eggs story. I feel if the game was longer and had time to be in-depth with all the development and concepts they were trying for, it would've been much more satisfying.This leads into my next point which the game was cut too short! I loved it, and the level design just started getting interesting when bam, you're forced back into your world. I realize game design is very difficult, and for the couple hours there was to play the gameplay mechanics and animation were outstanding, I just wish it could've continued.All-in-all, I would not buy this game for $13; however if it ever comes on sale you should consider all the good things about it. Go read some good and bad reviews and make a choice on if this is for you or not. Regardless, I hope I was able to help."

A refreshing take on first person perspective just as mirrors edge was.Yes, the story line is interesting. Yes, the game is enjoyable. (up to a point), however both of those ponitsloose their luster as you progress through out the game because of how increadibly Impossibly hard it becomesas you advance through the adventure.What should have been a fun relaxing enjoyable explorer game turned out to be a nightmare!Literally everything after Maddies challenge is all down hill in the enjoyment department.The game becomes a serious serious chore there after and I found my self just wanting to hurry up and finish it as quickly as possible.I didn't care about secrets, I couldn't care less about unlockables and the story line may as well never have existedas far as I was concerned! I wanted out!

That is how I would like to describe this game!It doesn't need to be this hard given the lack luster reward you get at the end of this game in my opinion.My problems with this title are as follows:CHECK POINTS WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY??Towards the harder parts of this game especially the last levels ICE CARVERNS or whatever it's called.There needs to be way more check points. This levels is damn near impossible man especially the hanging stalagtitescave swinging bull crap that's going on there (god I wanna break something!)The grapple beam controls are too precice AND imprecice at the same time; the thing requires that what everyou want to grab onto be dead center in your targeting thingy! Yet, it doesn't accurately judge its range accurately.It's supposed to let you know when you've got a lock, but it doesn't always.I've found im able to lock even when there's no indication, so sometimes you're waiting for the lock, you're in range but it doesn't come and you fall to your death!CONTROLLER MAPPINT??Really? it's 2016 and developers don't seem to get that in this day and age that people would like to changeall their friggin button mappings to what ever the hell they like! holy donkeys balls!!! what the actuall hell is wrongwith these devs??? This would have made life sooooooooo much easier if they allowed it but no.. you get literally two choices for controllers... Only keyboards can do what they want?? REALLY??? REALLY???Had they made this possible I'd play with a combination of controller and mouse.. Moust is way bette for aimingbut your jump button on the pad is on the A button If I were allowed to change this I could move and jump with my left hand and then aim and fire with the mouse problem solved but no.. now I'm stuck with either keyboard of controller.ended up beating it with just the controller....I HATE THIS MOTHER OF A GAME HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT!"

There is no real resolution or explanation in all the wrong ways. ~3 hours of frustrating gameplay did not make up for it. There should have been puzzles instead of the whole game JUST being tedious maneuvering and a few cutscenes. It became one of those games where half the checkpoints began to feel like a godsend. The grappling can be fun, but that cannot be the entire game, and if it's going to be centered around the ""story"". it should at least be a good story. A lot of development was missing that would have made this game a lot more engaging. I was pretty excited about this but I'm generally disappointed.

I got a poorly executed mess with what may be one of the worst stories I've ever experienced.The good:- The core concept is pretty interesting.  You jump from landing ground to landing ground by propelling yourself through grappling.  You also get a pair of rocket boots for an extra boost.-  Some of the environments are pretty.- It's short, so you don't have to endure it for long.The Bad:-The level design later in the game is pretty awful.  I frequently found myself alternating between baby's-first-platformer and obtuse sections where I had no idea where I was supposed to go.-The core mechanic is poorly executed.  It's difficult to gauge how far the rocket boots will take you, or how far a gapple will propel you.  I found myself very frustrated as I had to replay sections over and over again.-The voice acting is lackluster.  It ranges from ""Meh"" for the protagonist and his daughter, to ear-grating for the character Maddie.  I think her voice actress was trying to hide an accent.The Ugly:-One of the worst stories in any game I've ever played.  You're never given any reason to care about this uncle, who ***SPOILER WARNING***only shows up at the very end for about a minute.  I was expecting some grand reveal, or an epiphany on the part of the narrator, or SOMETHING TO MAKE ME FEEL ANYTHING FOR ANY OF THESE PEOPLE, but you just walk up to him, chilling in the middle of nowhere for no reason, and he's like ""What's up, I'm staying here , you're going home.  Peace, dude.""  AND THAT'S THE GAME'S GRAND CLIMAX!!!***END SPOILER***.  The game still tries to go full-on camp by also including a very boring subplot revolving around Maddie.  Seriously, the game didn't make me feel anything for any of the characters.-The writing frequently read like something written in Swedish and thrown into Google translator.  The phrase ""for disposal of garbage"" stands out to me.I'll gladly overlook bland gameplay for an enthralling and well-written narrative.  The reverse isn't true.

Whenyou're in the ice cave, sometimes even when yuou're in range of a block you can't grapple it. I had times where I was really closing to landing on a block and I try to grapple it so I can land but I can't, even though I'm lclerly close enough to grapple it. Then there's the windmill which you have to be so close to in order to grapple hook it's embarrassing. The problem here is that you're able to grapple hook rocks from so far away and then suddenly for some reason when you reach one of the windmills you have to be really close to grapple it or you just fall.

,Not Recommended,278360,29390078,Posted: 20 January,all,Sinque Productions,"This game was a slow disapointment. At first, it was farely enjoyable, but it soon occured to me it what was a waste of time and especially money.This game is a story of a boy who follows his uncle into a mysterious world but given as telling his daughter about it. The story is very akward. The boy goes to his uncles labratory and next thing he knows, he's in a suit and in a strange cave world. He spends no time to go through the cave until he finds a village of traditional fish people. It's pretty mysterious and strange. Eventually, he travels through dark caves with one of the fish people, a girl named Maddie. Together they go past the caves and into Starport, where Maddie decides to stay. He continues to an ice place where he thinks is uncle is. Eventually he finds his uncle and his uncle is glad he came, but suddenly wants him to go back.It is upsetting. After travelling through caves, sky areas, and ice caves, that the uncle attempted to have his son travel through, he just wants him to leave and go back to his world. He comes to be with his uncle, and his uncle won't even go back with him or better, or work with him in the things his uncle is about to do. While this game seems to advertise the story, but implements a very boring one with very boring characters. Maddie is a steroetypical excited girl. The cave village people are a steroetypical traditional no advancement group. The uncle is a steroetypical fun inventor guy. The boy is a stereotypical hero brave person. A Story About My Uncle has charcters that aren't exciting or interesting in anyway. The plot is a ""travel through a dangerous place and avoid the enemies to save someone even though the hero is a child a should have no chance mentaly and physically"". It is the epitome of a uncompelling, unrealistic, irrating, and bland adventure story. The singular path in the game only helps the feeling of a bad plot line.Gameplay wise, A Story About My Uncle is okay overall. The grapling hooks are amazing and feel great to use. The air pulls are fun. And so on. While the magical grapple hook is great, the other tools aren't that interesting. The jump, jump dash, and jetpack could have been much better. The jetpack holds you in place and then rockets you forward in the direction you are pointed. It is often obnoxious and moves you further than needed. It would have been much better if it blasted you up smoothly and it had a set amount of gas that would reset when you touched the ground again. The jumps are simply boring and simple. More tools interesting tools and/or a replacement to the jumps would have been better. More things like the grapple would be excellentAnother thing is the enviroment/map, which isn't so good. There is only one way to go for basically the entire time and occasionally side paths. More of a sandbox, more open area with more places to grapple to and go would work much better. It is puzzle with only one solution. I also would say, I either went through something first try, or had a ton of difficulty with it. There isn't much of a middle ground of difficulty for the game.The graphics and music were beautiful. It was one of the good things about the game. But with time spent ther, it spawns the biggest problem in the game, at least for me.There is so little content. There is so little to do. After spending a few hours to beat the game, there is almost nothing to do. Either you can replay the game, which is so short it feels like a repeat, or you can do the speed challenges. Again, the speed challenges are a repeat of the game. It makes me pretty upset. This game costs $13, and all you can get out of it is a few hours of enjoyment. Perhaps some people aren't as cheap as I am, but I don't like spending money on RPGs for reasons like this.If they added a working steam workshop where levels could be made and played by anyone, I would overlook the short campaign, bad story, and cringy gameplay, and I would instantly rating it up.This game could be so much better with a few changes and more time spent on it. 65/100"

,Not Recommended,278360,16489298,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,Jazzy Jamboree,"I bought this game when it was on sale for $2.50. That's like the price of a bottle of Pepsi. In that sense, I would rather have played ASAMU than have that soda, but at its full price of $13 there is no way I can recommend this game. The trailer made it look like a lot of fun, and for some brief moments it is- but the experience is short and marred by many flaws.The first thing I noticed right away is that the voice acting is horrible. Not quite Far Cry 2 levels, but pretty close. The narrator speaks flatly, choppily and sounds extremely unnatural. At best, he sets the premise- at worst he made me want to scream at the game and rage quit. The best example of this has to do with Maddie- Jesus, did I hate this character with an unbridled passion. When the narrator offered to take her on his back I threw my hands to my face and felt like sobbing. The minute I got to the first town I tried to leave her behind because she is so shrill and obnoxious, I did NOT want her clinging to me. It actually go to be such a nusciance that I muted the voice volume in the audio settings, and that's a first for me. There is already one annoying little girl in this game, there didn't need to be two. She is completely unnecessary to the story, and only serves to highlight how poor the writing was as she is completely flat with no character arc. Starts out as a brat and a loser, ends up in the other town as a loser (and possible brat).The concept of Fred cultivating an alien species doesn't really bother me, to be honest, but the design of them was pretty plain. Take a person, hit their face a few times with a sledgehammer, replace their feet with more hands and dump them in blue paint. Boom. You have the frog people. They just make for an extremely dull race that doesn't make me want to sympathize with them. To make matters worse, it's like the game forces you to care about them, because the game grinds to a screeching halt and confines you to the ground at the pace of  your grandma with her walker. These sections only serve to make you think that there is a real story in ASAMU and pad out the game.Even with this unncessary fluff, I still finished the game in barely over two hours. Like I said, I only paid $2.50 for this game, so the length doesn't really bother me, but damn. For the same price, I got The Fall, which I played for easily twice as long. For twice the price, I got LISA, which is easily 5-10 times the length of this game. Even with the short length, the game still feels very.... same-y. Sure, the environments change a few times, but they're really not eye catching or interesting, and the set pieces are scant with about the same amount of intrigue. If I recall them all, it goes cave, dark cave, one I can best describe as ""outside"", then ice cave. That's it. Special mention for the Cyclops worm that made me lmao at how cheesy it was.In addition to the extremely same-y environments, the gameplay really feels the same all throughout the game as well. Jump, grapple rock, grapple next rock, grapple next rock, land. Sometimes with crystals and more rocks. The only real upgrade of note is the rocket boots, which really don't change the way you think about any of the platforming puzzles. When you can't make the next grapple, you rocket. That's about it. When you get the orange portal in the eponymous series, all the puzzles change. It multiplies, expotentiates your possibilities to interact with the game world- but the rocket boots simply add more of the same.To end on a positive note, I will praise ASAMU for this: while I feel that the narrative is weak at almost every turn, I very much like the concept ofthe community written theory that Fred was really dead the whole time, dead from a mountaineering accident at the start of the game and the whole story is what the child has made up to believe that he's not rotting in some frozen crevice.In the end, I suppose it was an experience I'd rather have under my belt than not, but that bottle of Pepsi really gives ASAMU a run for its money."

The framing device used throughout the game is the protagonist narrating it as a bedtime story to his daughter. I hope it worked, because I would've fallen asleep if I were her.- The writing and voice acting both suffer from the fact that seemingly neither the writer or the voice actors are native English speakers; the dialogue (which, in its own right, is pretty terrible, with plenty of unintentionally funny parts) is riddled with grammatical errors, and the mostly mediocre voice acting is more of an annoyance than something you'll actually be interested in hearing.- While some parts of the game use interesting mechanics like a monster that will essentially kill you if it sees you moving, other parts serve to confuse you; there are some rooms with layouts that give barely any indication of where you're supposed to go, which is a huge problem when there are moving platforms that require you to think fast to navigate them.- Though the environments of the game are generally visually appealing, the design of the alien race you interact with is strange, unintentionally creepy, and outdated; the aliens wouldn't look out of place in a PlayStation 2 game.As I'm writing this, it's on sale for $2.59; at that price, I would get it, but when the sale ends, skip this."

For example, when I do a really good long jump, despite the length I am supposed to go, I fall short, because the game is heavily scripted in a way that you need to play it the way it was scripted to play. You need to use specific platforms to proceed, and no matter how good you are at exploiting the physics, the game will just kill you saying ""This game isn't meant to show off your skill, you can only proceed by taking these specific waypoints"".For some reason the devs thought it was a good idea to put scripted jumps in a platformer game.

Letting momentum carry me from one platforming challenge to the next.If this is what you're looking for here, look elsewhere.The levels are designed as a multitude of platforming puzzles. So after each puzzle you need to slam on the breaks, stop and observe, and then getting going once more. Moreover, there is no turning while grappling. So no spider man style swinging. Once you begin pulling yourself along using the grapple, its a straight shot only.Never before have I seen so many systems in a game that scream player freedom, so hampered by level design and bad controls in order to immediately limit that freedom. The game is creative and different and the world unique. I like those facets of the game.But the controls and level design conspire to frustrate any sense of fun one might have derived from the platforming."

However, the level design is glitchy and you can’t tell which bits of floating rock are in range or not. So, that amazing experience is mired by a frustrating fall to your doom again and again and again. It’s hard to keep the momentum going and spoils the experience. Level design typically has one path for the player to take, despite seeming open for problem solving. Forcing that one in-game path only exacerbates the frustration from falling just short of where your creativity wants to take you.It’s one of the few games where I actively ran past optional in game collectible so get to the end.But that actual ending though, straight shot to the heartstrings. Voice acting is wooden, sure, but not without its charm.It’s only a 5-hour game, tops. Buy it if it’s on sale for no more than $3-$4.

Ever since gta5 came out there wasn't anything that really even seemed worth looking forward to. At one point I went so far as to go outside, and it was there on a fishing dock where I found a youtube video of this game on my phone and it intrigued me greatly. My first impression was that it was some mashup of portal and mirrors edge and looking at it I actually assumed this game must have dribbled out of the sweet teets of Valve themselves. When I found out that the true creator was the same ones that put out goat simulator, that drew me in even further, finding it on sale was the final straw; I had to buy it...As I swung through the caves on my adventure, I became lost in the story. I'd been playing lesser games for so long that I had forgotten that unlockable cheats were a thing and that at one point they were meant to be be FUN, other than just spawn vehicle and infinite ammo. I realized that this game did not only have an excellent concept but it contained genuine heart as well. Some of my friends predicted this game would have a short playtime but i was actually able to get almost 6 hours out of it and I know I haven't explored most of the amazingly open levels. this doesn't mean it can't be speedrun however in fact it has a great deal of potential and even challenges you in the extras menu with an optional timer. I'm very glad that this game was able to come to a full release and as an indie gamer I feel confident saying that the developers very much deserve money for this game. Again, I've been showing this game off like a bad rash, but as I said before; I recommend this game most to those who feel the gaming world has grown a bit stale lately because it is a wonderful refresher on what a good game is suposed to look like and it reasserts the idea that games can also be presented as a form of art... 8.9/10 and thats with classic masterpiece portal representing about a 9.5 on my scale.-if any more proof is needed keep in mind that this game was worth writing a review which should say alot right there and I even proofread it briefly :p"

,Recommended,278360,10294016,"Posted: 30 May, 2014",all,neo,"Scroll to bottom for final verdictA Story About My Uncle is a first-person adventure platformer. The main gameplay involes using your grapple hook, power jump and rocket boots to advance through the level. The gameplay feels very fluid and smooth, and sometimes even challenging. The grapple hook is my favorite game mechanic in ASAMU because it feels amazing to zip through the air grappling from rock to rock, but it only has up to three uses before landing on the ground. The limited amout of uses creates another challenge for the player, where you must strategize how you will get to the other floating island before running out of charges. Most of the time this is easy to see where your grapple makes a mark on everything you hook on to, so you're able to see how your uncle made it across because of his marks on floating rocks. The power jump is exactly what it says, it gives you a very powerful jump. Combined with the sprint key, you're able to shoot out very far. The rocket boots don't feel very powerful to me, but they're useful nevertheless.The story revoles around you, a father, telling your daughter a bedtime story. You tell a story of your uncle Fred and his adventures and how you always wanted to be just like him. You stumble into his house hoping he is home when you find an adventure suit, custom made for you but your uncle never told you about it. It seems that he wanted you to find out yourself. You strap it on and it's equipted with a grapple hook and power boots. You enter his gigantic 'garbage disposal' and you're shot into the sky, leading you to an unknown world. Naturally, you feel ready for the adventure, and continue moving through this strange world with one misson: find Uncle Fred. The story seems a little cliche, where you need to go out on this big adventure to find someone, but it's not horrible, it's quite alright.The game includes no violence and no action, but it is better that way. The game focuses on the gameplay and narrative. As your progress through the world, you narrate what you saw and what happened. The game is very beautiful, with the textures very high resolution and the enviroments are mind blowing. Overall, the graphics are amazing, besides the people. The characters looks outdated the their animations are a bit strange. The audio is fantastic as well. The music always fits the athmosphere, ambient noises are soft and charming, and the landing sound is great. Another thing though, the voice acting isn't the greatest. You can tell the VA's first language wasn't English, but it's all right. The father and daughters voice acting is the best of the bunch. Maddie's is strange.FINAL VERDICTWhile the graphics and gameplay are great, the story and voice acting falls behind just a little bit, but what are you going to expect from a company's first game?8/10"

,Recommended,278360,10280094,"Posted: 29 May, 2014",all,AngstyPotato,"A very fun game, but I had some issues. First, it's short. It took me about 3 hours of gameplay tops to complete the whole thing.  There's not much more to say on that. Second is the gameplay. While the mechanics were great and gameplay was often fluid, it was very repetetive and tedious. Third and in my opinion, most important is the story. The game is called A STORY About my Uncle, and the story was lazy at best. The world that Coffee Stain created for this game is beautiful and incredibly atmospheric, and you can tell that there is a lot going on lore-wise. But the game doesn't elaborate on any of that. There is so much that is just so unexplained. Then there's the narration. The game tried to tell the story as a father telling his daughter a bed time story. Cute idea, and the basis for the whole game, but was executed poorly. As in, he hardly spoke. I think a Bastion-esque narration would have made a lot more sense here. And the actual story progression kinda sucks, but I feel it would have been better if the game was longer, as there would have been more character development, plot, etc;.ProsFun gameplayIntuitive mechanicsBeautiful/Atmospheric worldConsRepetetiveShortLazy storyBoring charactersI recommend this game, but wait for it to go on sale, as the $12.99 pricetag (even discounted to $11.69 for me) is a bit high for what you are getting."

I have so far took a break 3 times from the game already because some obstacles were just too annoying to complete. I'm love achieving 100% completion in games and I set out to find all the jewels in this game. At the beginning, it was a lot of fun. But when the game started getting complex with boosts, and limited 3 grapples and having to handle recharging them, it became a lot more annoying than fun. It is especially annoying when the character's head hits a rock. It becomes almost instant death. And I have to repeat the same obstacle multiple times.I would have enjoyed it more if the grapple functionality spins me around my target when I'm close rather than straight on collision.I vote ""No"" for this game because while I enjoyed the story, I dreaded playing it.

The graphics were nice, the environments beautiful and interesting, and the gameplay really fun.Unfortunately, the trailer shows all of the best bits of the short game that beat in a couple hours.

There are 'collectibles' you can get, but I don't feel compelled to try in the least.Anyway, pro con list:Pros:-Beautiful environments-Cute story-Interesting and fun gameplayCons:-Short-Poor NPC movements-Shallow NPC storyline (other than Maddie)-Cost-No Replayability-Though the story was cute, it was kind of weak, so the storyline gets both on both the pro and con list.-The voice acting was a bit off in partsWith more attention, this game could be great with sidequests, more characters, more enemies (there is only one in this game...that was a bummer) and a deeper story.

And best of all you don't kill a single thing throughout the game.  The challenges and game play ramps up nicely through the first four levels and then  the learning curve sweeps up precipitously in the fifth level. (Think of it as the boss level.) Many people criticize the last level for being tedious.  For me it was only slightly tedious because it was an ice level and looking at icy landscapes gets boring pretty quickly. Fortunately there is no Lava/volcano level, breaking the unwritten rule that all platformers have to have an ice level and a lava level.  One hint about the game that works for all of the levels  and especially the last level: don't just concentrate on your aim, but concentrate equally on your rhythm as well. Both aim and rhythm are needed to make it through the tricky parts.To sum up: very fun, very beautiful, and highly recomended"

,Recommended,278360,17975224,"Posted: 10 September, 2015",all,Dinokaiser,"A story about my uncle is a very hard game to describe, it is one of the few games that has a fantastic balance between story and game-play.The game-play is fantastic, it is a first person platformer with a fantastic “grappling hook” mechanic similar to what you'd expect from a first person Spiderman game, you will swing from place to place and eventually find new ways to get around, the game is linear, but by no means constricting, you can follow the path, but you can choose your own way of getting around the environment as well, in fact the game will reward you for doing so. The game is also very challenging, if you screw up you will not get much of a chance to recover, but fortunately the checkpoints are very generous and I never felt frustrated (ofcourse if you try to get the achievements I imagine you will go nuts as they can be absurdly challenging).While most games have a storyline of “epic heroes” and “villains”, this game has neither, there is no combat at all and there really aren't any “enemies” in the game, honestly I found it to be a massive relief from all the violence from most other games (don't get me wrong though I still love those games but seriously, there are very few games without some sort of violence in them).It is also not something like Gone Home either where there is very little “game-play” either. A story about my uncle is instead a simple story of a young man trying to find his uncle.... in an alternate dimension with a super suit that allows him to swing like it was Spiderman's birthday, deep stuff I know but it is literally a bed time story.Sarcasm aside it's a very sweet story, and one of the few games in the past few years to genuinely move me, there may not be that much dialogue in the story, but it is honestly just the amount that it needed.The game is very short roughly 2-3 hours long, which while very short, also has a lot of replay value (it's the length of a good movie and like any good game it left me wanting more), if you want a game with a moving story, great game play, beautiful graphics and an exhilarating feeling of soaring through the air, then I can only recommend a story about my uncle."

,Recommended,278360,17422660,"Posted: 6 August, 2015",all,a-type,"I think I would have found this game more compelling without attempts at storytelling. Although I love a good story, the execution of the narrative and dialog were both lacking. There was very little emotional payoff to the end to top off a consistently mediocre dialog/narration performance. The voice acting was at best believable, at worst downright awkward. Accents were all over the board and internally inconsistent. Fred himself was a decent performance, but only barely used. So, overall, a big 'meh' for the story elements. Although I will say, I did love the old-school whimsy of the environments. It's nice to see characters and landscapes that aren't designed to be dark, depressing and 'realistic', so full credit for that.The gameplay, though... was quite good. The mechanics were a bit odd to me at first, but they built up nicely. The ending puzzles were suitably difficult, and even adrenaline-inducing. There was only one gameplay aspect which I found to be truly bad, and that's the dash jump. With absolutely no control, I often found myself just barely overshooting a platform because I'd been a little *too* careful to make the gap. That's a frustrating feeling. I think making the dash jump have far less control than a normal jump is a good idea, but at least let us move a few inches for a bit of fine-tuning (or design long-reach platforms with backing walls/rocks to catch the player from over-jumping).Overall, I'd say if you don't mind cringing a bit at a mediocre story, it's worth a go."

76561198040630414,Recommended,278360,17749677,"Posted: 27 August, 2015",all,Shining Aquas,"A Story About My Uncle is a narrative exploration about a man relaying an adventure he had as a child to his daughter in the form of a bedtime story. In the adventure, he put on an ""adventure suit"" his uncle built for him and tampered with a device his uncle left behind that warped him to...somewhere else; the game doesn't really tell you where but it's also not important, so for all intents and purposes he was taken to ""another world"", one that is mostly constructed of impossibly floating rocks ala Avatar's ""Pandora"", or for bigger nerds ""Zendikar"".  Since his uncle used to adventure out into the world all the time and used to send postcards back, the fact that he hasn't been heard of in several months got him thinking that maybe his uncle ended up in this unusual world, and so he sets off to try and find him.Mechanically the game is played as a first person platformer, in which the kid in question walked into the device wearing a modified version of his uncle's adventure suit, which allows him to charge up a ""superjump"" and is also equipped with a grappling hook that gets upgraded very quickly to handle multiple mid-air grapples which also cause the game's difficulty to spike very quickly since it's expectations of what you can do slightly outpace your ability to get used to the awkwardness of trying to fly with a grappling hook without hitting the things you're latched onto.  The Floating Islands bit of the world design allows for the jumps to get pretty crazy and combined with the grappling hook also make a lot of the jumps fairly lengthy, but they also require you to have a pretty good understanding of momentum and how to make it work for you while in mid-air.  It's not an easy game by any stretch.As you travel through the game you'll meet a few characters, see a few significant landmarks, and are given small quantities of backstory via strange objects left behind regarding the relationship between the uncle and his nephew.  All that being said, the actual narrative isn't especially deep nor is it anything terribly surprising; you can guess most of how things are going to play out right from the beginning, and while there are surprises they aren't the sort that make the story any better so much as make the world around it more diverse.  I may not have gotten a lot out of the story, but the world construction was very imaginative and full of vibrancy, even in the darkest of places.  And even though the story wasn't anything really special, the conversation around the story between the father relaying the story and the daughter listening and interjecting made the experience feel quite genuine.Would I recommend it?  Yeah, but not desparately.  It's a neat game with some great scenery in a cool location, a story that isn't bad but maybe a little simple, and the game ends before it has a chance to get too stale, but getting there will probably require a fair chunk of trial and error.  If it's on sale, definitely get it.  Otherwise you have to ask yourself if this is your sort of game: If you like difficult platformers and beautiful scenery from what feels like a very small team of developers, you'll probably enjoy this."

The child and Fred's voice actors were decent, nothing special though.Story is fairly good, albeit short. That being said the bad voice acting can really make some people tune out the story, myself included, if you are one of those people I would recommend staying away from this game. I didn't enjoy the ending either, we don't find out what happened to anyone in the story apart from the main character who seems to be questioning if he believed it was all real...What you're really paying for is gameplay and stunning environments, the tutorial drags on a bit and it felt like making the player collect 3 crystals was just a cheap tactic to get more hours out of the game. I don't entirely agree with their decision to break the characters rocket boots for no reason, I understand it was probably to make sure the player doesn't feel like they're just repeating the same jumps over and over but in my mind it achieved the opposite.Some of the jumps are uncessarily hard and there doesn't seem to be any real progression of difficulty, the hardest part of the entire game is when Maddie challenges you to get from point A to point B without using your grapple, after that everything seems easy.You're probably thinking that it's all been negative so far yet I recommended the game, and you're right it seems strange, even to myself. Even with all of the games flaws, for £3, or maybe even the full price of ~£6 i'd recommend it, it's easy to forget it's not an AAA title and they probably did the best with what they had and despite these flaws it's a fun little game and I enjoyed my time playing it."

It's a first person platformer with a grabble beam similar to the one in the Metroid Prime troilogy. Progression is mostly linear but there are some places where you can take shortcuts. There's not much of a variety of tools that you'll be using, but it keeps the controls simple and lets you focus on building your skills. The graphics are nicely done and it runs very smoothly with antialiasing and motion blur. Although it seems liek it was designed for keyboard and mouse, I had no problem playing it with an Xbox 360 controller.The character animation underwhelming. There's very little of it in the game and if feels very mechanical. The character designs don't match the quality of the enviroments and objects. The narrator's voice acting and recording quality is quite poor. It sounds like someone's reading it off the page and whoever's reading it doens't have a lot of experience speaking into microphones and it needs some equalizing. It's the only aspect about this game that feels unprofessional.  But the other characters actually sound pretty good.Despite the simple controls, this game presents a few good challenges.

With no expectations what so ever i launched the campaign.The story is driven by ""The nephew"" narrative who tells a bedtime story to his daughter about when he went looking for his uncle fred in a fantasy world full of friendly salamander people. The gameplay itself is a relaxing 3D platforming where you use a grapling hook and rocket boots to get around and it all feels tight and flowing and occasionly reminded me of  the Portal games.If you are looking for a cute, relaxing, mildly challenging game to play an afternoon i do recommend this game, especially if it's on sale.The game took me about 2 1/2 hours to beat but if you are a speedrunner and/or achivement collector the game has some replay value with a time trials mode and challenging achivements basicly consisting of completing levels without falling down and to use your grappling hook as little as possible."

,Recommended,278360,14669223,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,digivampire,"Super fun parkour 3d platformer, with grapple mechanics. Little frustrating to start with until I got used to the movement and controls. Overall graphics are very nice, not to complicated or distracting but can be dazzling at certain points. Difficulty ramps up slowly giving you time to learn over time, and will test you towards the end a lot with some really difficult chained jumps.My biggest gripe is with the grappling hook itself. While you have an indicator when it can latch, it's difficult to figure out how close you have to be to the object for it to trigger. This is mostly evident later with larger objects you want to grapple on which may trick you as being close enough when in fact you are not. Only other lackluster detail is that there is no map, so you might be lost trying to figure out where to go next. While the path is not linear it nearly is so, it's just the matter of figuring out how to proceed, which may have multiple options in immediate vicinity.The story is fairly simple but charming if not satisfying towards the end. If you enjoy platforming, decent story and up for some challenge, do get this.9/10"

Only buy if it's on sale.Pros:-Fun, challenging first-person 3D puzzle platformer.-No ""training wheels."" This is a subjective pro/con, but I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that this game simply introduces mechanics then throws you to the wolves, making you use your head (and much trial and error) to solve some of the puzzles.-Setting and environment is amazing in this game. The various levels feel alien, yet vaguely familiar.-The introduction and setup to the story was amazing and very poignant. I'll get to the rest of the plot in the cons section.Cons:-EXTREMELY short game. I finished my entire first playthrough in just over two hours, and I have archived stream footage to prove it.-Horrendous voice acting. I've heard better speakers at third-grade Thanksgiving plays.-Character models are sub-par by most standards.-Taking the last two points into consideration, I feel as if the devs concentrated all their effort on level design and completely ignored the characters. Which is a shame, because the story suffers greatly from flat, boring characters, visually and vocally.-Back to the plot: it starts off very well, and just gets increasingly worse from there. I know many people writing reviews about this game loved the plot, but honestly I found it mostly un-authentic and cheesy.Conclusion:A Story About My Uncle tried to be the next Portal or The Talos Principle, and it got half-way there. The game did have some very fun, challenging puzzles and great, atmospheric level designs. However, it missed the heart and soul that a good game should have. The devs didn't spend enough time on the plot and on the characters, and the result was a game that had a short, cheesy plot with an abrupt ending, and flat, boring characters. I recommend this game, but only barely. Only buy if you can find it on sale, because it's definitely not worth its current price of $13."

One of my best Steam sales purchases ever!!!I do have a couple gripes...The narrorator was absolutely terrible.  Killed the story.  I volunteer my time and voice to the development team ro redo the voice work.  It was monotone and not a bedtime story to a child or the sound of an adventurer...  My other minor gripe is the achievements.  I like going to achievements and looking how far I made it in the game compared to the world.  I earned zero achievements... zero.  I beat the game... zero.  Each of the over three hour long (multipe check points thank goodness) levels deserves an achievement.... just so I know how many people made it that far.  With this game it could also be fun to have some kind of leaderboard for how many times people died in each level.Great game guys!  I am greedy and want a little bit more.

I wouldn't call it a twitch game because my reflexes are crap, and I managed to complete it without too much trouble. If you enjoy maneuverability from a first person perspective, sailing through the air, and pretty scenery with soft music, then you will like this game.

76561198108183039,Recommended,278360,21954735,"Posted: 20 March, 2016",all,DiabolicalDude,"I'm only recommending this because of the mechanics. The rest is below average.Story:You are a dude who is recounting the story of finding his inventor uncle who created a distant world with frog people. The entire story is pretty much you trying to find your uncle and overall, it’s not very engaging. I didn’t care about the uncle because he never shows up and simply is just the goal. I never cared about the narrator because he literally has no characteristic other than “I want to see my uncle”. Maddie, a person you meet on the way can literally be described by the words “rebellious teenager” and drops out half way through. The sad thing is that there was potential there for great lore. At a certain point, you walk around the village and see how it’s been constructed through garbage. These parts seemed interesting and I wanted to know more about the people but everything is just so static and lifeless. A real disappointmentGameplay:This is where the game shines. It’s a first person puzzle platformer where you get around by super-jumping, grappling/lassoing, and rocket boosting. The main mechanic is the ability to tether surfaces and be attracted to them. You go from one platform to another to get to the exit. This combined with the super jump and rocket boots allow you to really soar through the sky and let you build up a lot of speed. The peak is the wide open areas where you can just triple lasso into a rocket boost and land like a superhero. It’s great. I wish so much of the game wasn’t in caves and restrictive channels but the open areas are fun. However, the checkpoints are pretty spread out and they feel very annoying.Graphics/Performance:(with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)Ran above 60 all the time and (THANKFULLY) has a FOV slider. The game isn’t much of a great looker and has a distinctive cartoonish style. However, the models seem very… modely? They look like a doll rather than having life and moving around naturally.Final Thoughts:Overall, the game isn’t bad but the story really lets it down. The parts where you are just flying through the sky are fun but the caves at the end are more annoying than anything. Get it on sale and try it out."

,Recommended,278360,16509100,"Posted: 18 June, 2015",all,MnMaxon,"TL;DRThis was a really fun game that I enjoyed a lot, but I thought the game was very short.  I was originally hesitant about reccomending this game due to the length of the game, but it seems like I completed this game with almost unnatural speed, so this game might be worth the price for other players (especially completionists).PriceI spent 2.50 on this game, and I usually think a game is worth the cost if I play at least an hour per dollar spent.  I am a compulsive buyer, so if a game bores me, I tend not to play it very long because at this point I've collected a lot of other games I could play instead.  That being said, if this game was not on the Summer sale, I do not think I would have been very happy paying the full price (currently $13) for this game.  Most people seem to spend about 5 hours on the game to complete the main story.  I'm not really sure how I completed it so fast, maybe my experience playing Just Cause 2 and helped.Extra Things I Did not Take Advantage ofAlso, if you are worried about the play time, there are achievements you can try to get.  They seem to be pretty hard and I didn't achieve a single one while playing, so they would probably give a couple hours of gameplay.  I did not decide to attempt to get the achievements because I did not feel like replaying the game.  This is not to say that the game wouldn't be fun to replay, I just have a lot of new games from the Summer sale now, so I would rather play them.StoryThe story was pretty good.  Some parts were kind of cliche, but I thought the very end was kind of sad.  I did not really like the narrators that much, but they weren't aweful.GameplayAll around the gameplay was amazing.  The super jumps were really cool.  The grappling hook was a lot of fun, but I did not like it as much as grappling hooks from other games, such as Just Cause 2.  There was something that left me a little unsastisfied when using it, but I can't exactly figure out why.  I think my problem was I would have liked the grappling hook to pull quicker.  This might be a little bit of a spoiler about the last item in the game, so if you don't want to see it skip to the next section.  The very last items you get are rocket boots. They are really cool, but I wish you could use them longer before the game ends.VisualsI thought the people models weren't great, but other than that the graphics looked really nice.  When I showed my brother the game, he didn't think the game was an indie game due to how good the game looked.  I also think the level design really added to the visual aspect.ConclusionThis game is really fun, and my only big issue with it is the price.  If you see this on a sale, you should definitely get it, but if it's not on sale I would wait until it gets put on sale, but I don't think it would be a bad idea to pay full price for the game, it really is enjoyable."

Really.-Low replay value unless you are into speed running and collectible finding.-Not worth the full cost, I got it on sale for about $2.44. I wouldn't pay more than $7 for this game.-The animation of the creatures is a bit off and they don't really interact with you very much.Overall I am mixed on this game. I loved the platforming mechanics it had but I also felt it could have been a bit more challengeing and longer. I would play the game if you like platforming puzzle games but aside from that skip this title becuase you will beat it in about 2 hours."

It's a puzzle platformer with a charming, simple story leading your character along: your uncle Fred has gone missing during one of his adventures, and you want to know what happened to him.I will praise the game for its environments. I enjoyed entering a new area and getting to look around at everything. The only downside to this is if you have♥♥♥♥♥♥reflexes or suck at puzzles (as I do), then looking at these pretty areas can get a bit tedious after twenty deaths, and you'll long to either go forward or back just to get a change of scenery.The story is, as I said, simple and charming. You meet a couple of characters, but I was disappointed to see a lack of world building. You enter a new area, but no details are given about it. In one area early on, you're given the impression that everyone fears a place called the Chasms, and yet none of the locals sit down and explain why. You couldn't go up to random NPCs and talk about what was going on. You couldn't trigger conversations with Maggie once she was on your back. For me, I love a good story that has a bit of that in it. The lack doesn't make the story bad, its just a personal preference of mine.I will say that the ending, for all its build up, seems rather abrupt. After chasing Fred all around these fantastical places, and wondering what would lead him so deep into this realm, the answer you get is... lackluster. It makes sense, logically, and it ties the story off, but if you were craving some kind of big dramatic ending to go with the story like I was, it won't give you that.All in all, I give the game an 8/10. It's got heart, its got charm, its beautiful and it doesn't stick around longer than need be. If you're here for a simple story, no great big strings attached, then that's what you'll get. Enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect much more than that."

The artwork is nice, the world was built pretty well, and the game mechanics are fun.  I didn't feel anything was groundbreaking here, but it did keep me playing all the way to the end.I felt the story was just there to make an excuse for the game itself.  I didn't find myself really caring about the characters, but that was fine.   I think Gone North really just wanted me to swing around with a grappling hook for a few hours, and figure out a few puzzles, and I'm quite fine with that.  I picked the game up on sale for less than two bucks, so it was well worth what I spent, and full price at $13, I could probably be convinced to buy it for that much.

,Recommended,278360,21597597,"Posted: 2 March, 2016",all,Pachii,"A heartwarming Gem plagued by strange level design and Technical difficultiesA Story About My Uncle (AKA: ASAMU) is a narrative platforming adventure starting the main character retelling his tales as a young boy looking for his Uncle Fred, a bright minded inventor who spends most of his time spanning the globe and tinkering with experiments. But one day, Fred vanishes again and doesn't call back. No post cards, no nothing! So after suiting up and preparing himself, his son delves into the underground world and the mysteries that lie within.ASAMU is a Fantasy adventure platformer. Spanning across lovely environments from underground villages to sky-bound cities almost like Bioshock infinite. The player gets around with a grappling hook, allowing high-flying Parkour that can be fun, with more additional features unlocked in later chapters. However, it isn't without its problems as you'll soon find yourself missing easy landings because the collision box is slanted the wrong way.The Parkour lets you the freedom of taking your own path, allowing some rather amazing bounds and turns. However as a result the game has no clear marker of where to go most of the time. More so, you can easily get lost or end up going in circles most of the time like I have several times. And when you hitThe ice cavesyou might as well be playing super meat boy. I'm pretty sure I broke my mouse a bit because I smashed it in rage over slip-sliding over an unfortunately slanted Collision box and falling off, going back quite a ways.Which brings me to my next issue:Checkpoints.There are far too few for how difficult the game can be at times. By the time you're in the third-fourth chapter you will struggle a lot to get anywhere. Spending up to an hour on a 'simple' bit simply because you hit your head. For a game with basis around momentum, it sure seems to struggle with the concept!Anyway, Verdict.Should you buy it?: In my opinion? Not for the $13 it was asking. Maybe $10, probably $5, definitely at its current (At time of writing) price of $1.24Pros+High Flying Parkour with Grapple systems (And later additions) is practically always fun.+Story and Environments are fun, short and sweet. Some designs are just beautiful to look at.+Characters are fun to be around, and bond with more so.+Narrative bits you get between the main character and his daughter when you find your uncles parts is nice to hear.Cons-UE3, and all the Optimization issues that come with.-Not enough checkpoints in particularly difficult areas.-animation on most things animaated is stiff and lanky, especially if you pay attention to surrounding NPC's. Some are just plain frozen.-Collision missing from several pieces of terrain. Nothing game breaking, but not great to notice.-Momentum sometimes lost out of no place, resulting in infuriating times with levels.-Short, took me only 3 hours (And I spent a lot of time stuck on places.)"

,Not Recommended,278360,21611046,"Posted: 3 March, 2016",all,SilentZero,"Introduction:A Story About My Uncleis a first person platformer about a boy who finds an amazing power suit and sets off on an adventure to find his missing uncle.  The suit grants him several abilities, such increased jump height, protection from fall damage, and grappling from object to object.  As the player, you take on the role of this boy and navigate through strange new lands and floating continents that will not only test the suit's limitations, but your patience as well.TLDR Highlights:++ Beautiful Environments+ Great Concept+ Short+ Voice Acting-- Story Snoozefest-- Repetitive/Frustrating-- Inconsistent Grapple Mechanic- Difficult Achievements= So much potential, but fails due to its own clunkiness and lame story (which should be the best part, given its title).  Honestly, don't bother.  But if you must, then at least catch it on sale.Review:PROS--  The first person swinging physics stuff - basically the ""grapple hook"" thing the whole game is centered around - is a very cool concept, and I'd like to see more of this kind of thing.  And throughout the entire game one thing at least remains constant: the beautiful environments.  If the game had more open world maps it would be fun just swinging around all over the place, exploring and taking in the sights.  Sadly, the game is pretty linear for the most part, but at least it looks great along the way!The voice acting is pretty good, but not fantastic.  The way it's implemented is crucial to the telling of the story, and the game wouldn't be the same with out it. However, I found some of the speech disconnected and awkward at times.  Still, I'd say it was done quite well overall and more of a pro than a con.Also, I noticed other reviewers consistently put the game's short length in the cons category, but I'm the opposite.  I think this is a wonderful thing!  I barely got through the handful of hours as it was.  If it took twice as long to finish I'm not sure I would have been able to tolerate it enough to finish.CONS-- Considering this is called ""A Story About My Uncle"", the story side of the game is pretty awful.  The grown up version of the main character is telling a bedtime story (iirc) to his daughter, and rightly so, because it would make just about anyone fall asleep.  The story is as simplistic as it gets and extremely anticlimactic.  I was completely dumbfounded at the end, like, ""I went through all that, and that's all there is?""  Very disappointed about this.So what did I go through exactly to get to that lame ending?  Lots and lots of falling/dying and just as much frustration, that's what.  The whole goal throughout the game is to grapple and jump from place to place, often with a bottomless cavern or some such below.  A single mistake and you plummet to your death before being taken back to the previous checkpoint, which can be pretty far in some places.  This creates a lot of repetition that gets old fast and generates a lot of frustration indeed, maybe even rage depending on your level of patience lol.What makes that even worse is the inconsistency of the grapple.  In one area you'll be able to grapple super far, and then five minutes later you're somehow not in range of a giant rock at half that distance.  Also, the surfaces that the grapple will work on is inconsistent as well.  You can grapple on to every surface in sight one minute, but then when you're trying to grapple that big floating rock just a few feet away, hovering above a cavernous pit, suddenly your grapple only works on a few square centimeters of the entire thing and if you don't hit that exact spot you fail.  Honestly, it feels like the devs deliberately tweaked the range and grapple-able surface area in certain spots simply to increase the difficulty.  But it does't make the game harder, just incredibly annoying and sometimes infuriating.Finally, because a lot of people are OCD about getting achievements, I'll add something here.  You'll probably find it extremely difficult to get more than a few achievements in this game since they are mostly challenges that require minimal uses of the grapple or not falling.  As for myself, I'm not sure I want to put myself through the misery of trying, but we shall see.OVERALL--  I was very excited when I got this game on sale, and Ireallywanted to enjoy this game... but I didn't.A Story About My Unclehas so much potential in so many ways, but it fails due to it's own clunkiness and inconsistency, not to mention a lame story when that should probably be its best feature given its title.  There's no way I can recommend this game in good conscience, but should you feel the need to try it for yourself (based on all the positive reviews or whatever), I do recommend that you at least do yourself the favor of catching it on sale."

It's not long, a bit longer than an average feature length film (although a lot longer if you decide to go back and speedrun everything), but I think that's okay. The story and characters are endearing for its short length, the core gameplay is entertaining; easy enough to get the hang of given the short length, but difficult enough to still provide the challenge needed for the game to stay engaging, and finally the aesthetic charm of both the environments, music and artstyle all contribute to produce a fantastic overall experience.If that all sounds awesome to you, I encourage you to buy this game! If that sounds like it may or may not appeal to you, then wait for the game to go on sale and then pick it up (as I chose to do as a reluctant buyer). However, in the end I'd have been willing to pay full price for the experience the developers provided if I'd known what I'd be getting beforehand. If you're willing to drop 12$ to see a movie, then spending about the same for an interactive experience of the equal if not better quality should be a no-brainer."

The rare parts that are not so easy are only challenging because they force you to fly around in mid air rotating a lot...that tends to be disorienting.The gameplay is very straightforward. You learn almost everything at the beginning (only one ability is added a bit later) and use that all over again for the remainder of the game. The only reason it doesn't become all that dull and repetetive is the fact that the game is so very short.The story is like a fairlytale. The MacGuffin narrative style.

It's an incredibly well-put-together platformer with beautiful environments, a great array of platforming puzzles, and a fun premise.I can't say enough good things about the sights and sounds of the game.  The environments were always fantastic to look at, and the sound effects and music are equally beautiful.  Put simply, it's a game-world that made me want to  be in it, for as long as possible.The story arc is simple and kind of secondary--most of the interesting parts are revealed by finding ""optional story objects"" and I actually almost forgot I was looking for my uncle, despite the title--but I would highly recommend trying to find the extra objects, because the ones I did find were worthwhile and I will definitely be going back to find the rest.  As for having forgotten about the uncle, that might be in part because there is another character that, if you're a sap like me, will steal the show and make up for it.I finished my first run-through in about 6 hours, so the game is pretty short, and might be shorter depending on how much better at puzzle-platformers than I am (probably a lot) and how much you care about getting the story objects (you should).  There were a few segments that I had to try several (dozen) times to complete, and a few places where some extra checkpoints would have been nice, but on the whole the gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and the puzzles sport a solid variety."

The mechanics are easy to understand but tricky to master.The levels are very wide open and allows for a LOT of agency while playing, perhaps more than the game intended though because there was many a time where I landed on a surface with no collision detection.The story is told mainly through narration and downtime between gameplay is minimal. It only takes about 3 hours to beat so if you're consious of money-to-time ratios, you might want to wait for a sale to get your money's worth.

The mechanics are the best part of the game where the main mechanic is the grappling hook used to jump/hang around the ""puzzles"". They then added jump boost, higher jump and so on which compliments the core game mechanic, which is the grappling hook. A very smooth and well thought out design from a game design perspective. It is also a very solid game mechanic which was used very well from a gamers perspective.The story itself was interesting enough. Frogs, portal, crystals, hovering islands, uncle and so on. But the context it was used in was again very well done. Everything in the game makes sense with the story. The mechanics, the elements, the environment, the npc, the architecture choice and so on all complimented the story and mechanics. Nothing felt out of place or randomly placed.The level design might be flawed in some areas for some people, as it does require you to look around or boost jump to find out where to go next. Besides that it was a good level design too but not the best part of the game.All in all a very good game but the closure of the story could have been better."

From there you are shot from a pad into a different world where crystals power everything, frog people are everywhere, cities and homes float on rocks. You have to grapple jump, rocket your way through area to area. Grappling from flying rock to flying rock. Jumping from cliff to cliff all in the search. You meet a companion along the way who will taunt you with a little game.It's fun, short, and things just kinda work. They also have a time trial thing after the game if you are into speed running.

,Recommended,278360,12531206,"Posted: 17 October, 2014",all,j_mag94,"""A Story About My Uncle"" is an indie title that boasts a magical art style and a simple yet poignant bedtime story format, as told by a father to his daughter. You play as the narrator, a young man who traverses across space to find his uncle, who is presumably doing some sort of insane experiment. Throughout the story, you come across a race of alien people and use your uncle's space suit to explore worlds in a sort of parkour format.While this game doesn't have so much in terms of puzzles, the challenge lies in being able to catapult yourself across vast spaces using a grappling device and some rocket boots that can be helpful in a jam. While playing through the story, you may find some hidden objects tucked away, which trigger more storytelling opportunities about the backstory of this  man's uncle.As an indie game, this one fares very well. It has a short story, a handful of different environments, and new powers and tools are introduced in each one. Details are thoughtfully put into all the landscapes you come across, even if they serve no purpose aside from aesthetic appeal. That being said, the game can be a little glitchy. The problem with giving the player so much jumping power is the fact that you can sometimes skip necessary paths that are needed to trigger events, which can lead to some backtracking. Likewise, the freeroaming you are granted is sometimes overwhelming. Grapple points and ledges may be few and far between, leaving you with little knowledge about where to go or how to get there.Overall a great concept with a solid execution. The sheer abundance of power the player has sometimes allows them to plow straight through important areas without even realizing this, and the development team should have fixed that. Voice acting sometimes gets lazy, but the budding complexity of the characters helps make that. I would really like to see how this game would be improved if it was made by a bigger developer. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes casual games, adventure games, fantastic artwork, and heartwarming stories."

You have to be a bit patient at times, and for those with slow reflexes..you may fall short at some points. When I say ""slow reflexes""..I mean there will be times..where if you don't click at the very right seconds..you will fall, die, and respawn all the way back at the bottom of that giant thing you just scaled/went around/etc. Like every open-stage game, there are some minor issues. As in some areas, I beat the puzzle..by finding slanted areas that I could land on, and continue on my merry way.Though my biggest warning to players..is be prepared for the ending..because it will not be what you expect. I mean that in the most serious way I can. I know everybody says about games..though really..the ending isn't shocking, devastating..or sad..just melancholy..it will make you question it..wish for more..but alas..there is none..Anyway..Love the game, quirks and all."

It's nice and short which help keep it's focus, which is always a plus. The level design can be a bit confusing, but the lack of handholding is actually pretty great. It helps the game feel more open than it really is, since you feel like you can go anywhere. And you want to explore this fantastical world. Once you do, however, you will soon find out it's barren and quite devoid of (non-plant)life. Some ambient creatures would be great to make it feel less empty.All the mechanics are revealed pretty early on in the game, so it loses some of it's momentum later on. The grappling system is pretty one dimensional. It's more of a harpoon than a  grapple; so no swinging (would be a great mechanic to switch between the two), unfortunately.The story was why I bought this game though: and it's really charmingly told. If you got 5 bucks to spend you can't really go wrong, in my opinion."

76561198037005915,Recommended,278360,12592050,"Posted: 21 October, 2014",all,HeroSpirit,"A Story About my Uncle is an unpolished gem among the Steam Library. Though short, poorly textured, and horrible voice acting, the mechanics, scenery, and story outshine all it's flaws.When I first played through the first level of this game, I was hooked on the grapple system. It was so similar to Spider-man's web-swinging, but it didn't feel as clunky or hard to control as it though. The way it works is you can click any surface within range and draw yourself to it. In addition, you can grapple multiple times before landing, which allows for some interesting parkour throughout the area. Each stunt I pulled with the grapple system /never/ failed to make me feel like I just did something impressive. In addition, the only way you can really die in this game is by falling into the abyss, which I thought made the game that much more relaxing. There were times in the game where it tried to feel a little more dangerous, and beckoned you to move quicker, but it offered nothing to back these claims of urgency up. Just move at your own pace and you'll be fine. Don't get me wrong though, this game has flaws, and lots of them.The voice actors are hilariously awful. Hard to listen to at first, but then you start giggling at how terribly they deliver certain lines, and wonder to yourself how they even got into this game. Either the designer didn’t care, or they must have been personal friends of him/her. Either way, they were difficult to ignore throughout the entire game. In addition, the game’s graphics are not the best. Minimally-rezzed textures scatter this game’s landscape, which look really good from a distance, but up close you are painfully reminded this is still an indie game. In fact, some textures in certain parts of the game feel so out-of-place that you end up stopping to tilt your head at it before moving on. (you’ll understand what I mean if you play this game). Luckily, the player models and textures are alright, though some background characters aren’t even animated, which also makes you tilt your head as you pass them. None of the background characters have any sound either, which is a little creepy. (Or, should I say, none of the background characters have sound that you can understand).The one thing that really saved this game for me though...was the story. A Story About My Uncle follows the nephew of an esteemed scientists and inventor named Fred (not the most appropriate name, but after remembering this is a children’s story, you eventually allow it). The nephew, or “protagonist” searches for his uncle who has been missing for months, only to be thrown into an interstellar adventure to another planet of some kind? What really perplexed me about the story was that the game itself couldn’t seem to decide whether the events that transpired actually happened... or were purely fictional. The story is told in a hilariously false manner, purposefully stretching the truth left and right only to cover its tracks later to try to pass itself off as a true story. Despite this though, the story was endearing, and left me with a fuzzy feeling inside as I reached it’s conclusion. The only character that sticks around long enough for you to care about (and the only one that sticks around for more than 90 seconds) is Maddie, who is relatable enough to get attached to through the story. In addition, the lore objects found throughout the game give all the main characters enough depth to care about as well, which I thought was a needed touch.Overall, A Story About my Uncle is a game that you have to take the good and the bad with. It has just as many flaws as it does strengths, but I loved the grapple mechanic, I loved the concept, and I truly believe this is an indie game worth the money it’s asking. In addition, I happily await a sequel. (so long as they don’t use the same actors >_>)"

The story and world building are great for a small game. For an indie title, the graphics are sometimes breathtaking - largely because of the design rather than huge textures. The narrator is great here too. Hearing him tell his daughter a bedtime story was much more interesting than pure exposition. The game does well there too - there are no audio logs or pages of books. Just a simple description from the narrator and the player experiencing the world. You can get pretty much everything you need from that.

It's fun enough that I played it all the way through in one sitting. Would recommend to those who just want a casual afternoon's worth of pleasant game experience.Pros - Interesting game mechanics, fun figuring out different ways to get stuff done, cute story.Cons - The ""Let's play a game, I bet you can't do this without the grapple"" (note, you can do it with the grapple - her voice saying ""told you so"" was enough to make me do it without it) bit. Voice acting's a little stiff - but from what I can tell, it's like their second or third language so not really arguing it here."

It was on sale a few days ago, so I thought why not. I started it up, it ran great :). The mechanics are super fun, and give you a very good amount of breathing room in the begining to get used to the controls (a weird super jump thing on right click). The story is cute. Its about a kid who went on a huge adventure to this other world to find his uncle, but he is telling it to his daughtor as a bedtime story as an adult. Ocasionally they have little nods of diologue such as her asking about something you've found in the game, like your uncles favorite food. I would have to say, this is the best first person 3D platforming I have ever played. It get a bit challenging in the end, but it's all doable with a few tries. The hardest time I had was getting somewhat lost in a few sections, but each autosave point gives you a general direction to go. Some of the landscapes suprised me. Everything felt huge! In a good way. The ending left me satisfyed and a little sad. It is a very bitter sweet ending that made me even shed a tear or two. If I had to give this game a score, it would probably be 9.5/10. Yes the game is short, and maybe they could have explored the mechanics a bit farther, but what they put together was a beautiful experence that you can have in about 2 hours."

I'm not sure what the story behind the game development is but it's weird; the levels are beautiful and some of the transitions are really cool (I loved the one when you leave the caves - WOW) and this game would be a mind blowing Rift game were it ever to get supported, but on the other hand, the NPCs really feel like an afterthought and the story comes to a very unfulfilling end, which is too bad since there's a LOT of potential here.I'd say, play the game, knowing that you're gonna be going through, exploring and wondering at each level until very abruptly the game will end without answering anything about most of what you just went through.

If you can pick it up on sale.I really don't think the game is worth the $13 that it costs normals. I picked it up on sale for a little over $3.

I wish it was longer because I really did enjoy it. I was a bit disapointed when it was over.Now lets talk about the gameplay. I loved it. It's a platformer, so if you aren't into that kind of stuff, don't buy it. I really like the design of the world. Okay, so since it is a platformer, with your character swinging around with a grapple device and jet boots, you have to have your timing down. The being too late or too early will kill you. I've read some people saying that the jumps are nearly impossible, but I didn't find that to be the case. There were 2 jumps total that took me a lot of tries and got me a bit frustrated, but that's all. The rest are just fine.The game has a time trial mode, which is kind of a dead giveaway that it's not a long game. But if you're into trying to beat your personal best time, that would be for you.So in conclusion, this was a great, short game. I wouldn't mind paying like 5 bucks for it, but I woulnd't pay any more. It's just not enough gameplay to be worth more imho."

The story is about the father (as a child) who wanted to go on all his uncle Fred’s adventures with him and how one day Fred disappeared. He had been transported to another world and the father had gone to find him.The way the game was set up story-wise (an interactive bedtime story) was pretty unique and rather cool in and of itself. The actual plot of the story though, wasn’t all that thrilling and only took about 3 hours to complete.II – UI [10/10]The user interface in the game was incredibly minimal, which is always a good thing when immersion is your goal. It blended well with the game and was easy to keep track of. Sleek, smooth, simple.III – Gameplay [8/10]Gameplay in ASAMU was very unique. As much a connoisseur of platformers as I am, I had yet to play one in such medium as this. First person was, for me, a whole new take on the genre. Not only this, but the means of exploring the in-game world was rather fun.You’re equipped with a sort of plasma grappling hook with which you will be swinging and pulling yourself around the alien planet. Also, later into the game you get a nifty pair of rocket boots which can aid you in crossing longer distances while airborne. Mostly, I used the rocket boots to correct my screw ups and over-shoots.Sometimes though, it was a bit difficult to figure out where you were supposed to go next.IV – Content [3/10]ASAMU was a fairly short game and it had a decidedly small amount of content. The only two items you get the entire time are the grappling hook (and attached adventuring suit) and the rocket boots. While this was really all you needed to get around and complete the game, I feel like have additional options would’ve made it more interesting. The lack of content made the game feel rather small on the whole.V – Visual [8/10]The graphics of ASAMU were pretty good and I had a lovely visual experience for the most part. The world was very detailed and looked beautiful. As much as I wish I could say the same for the NPCs, I cannot. The NPCs, I felt, were poorly animated and poorly rendered. There animating wasn’t very cohesive with the rest of the game and their movements were overly stiff. Similar to Batman in Batman Begins, only not as cool.VI – Audio [6/10]What little music there was in ASAMU was really good. I enjoyed it, however sparse. The sound effects were even top notch; from the grappling hook to environmental ambiance.Once again though, the NPCs (and this time we add in the voice acting) fell much too short of the mark. The narrator (the father) sounded very unconvincing throughout the story. The NPCs (the frog people who inhabit the alien planet) sounded like a bunch of middle school students reading lines off of a paper. A few of them even had terrible, terrible accents. The only person who sounded mildly into their job was the narrator’s daughter.VII – Overall [6.7/10]Overall, A Story About My Uncle wasn’t a bad game, but it wasn’t a great one either. I’d say it’s good for a play-through (maybe two at the most) and I am happy that I got it during the Steam Holiday Sale rather than paying full price."

Told as a bed-time story to a daughter, the game is played as an adventure whilst the narrator recounts what you are going through. There are no fights or battles (as a no good bed-time story should have) which can leave some players wanting more, but there are enough extras to collect which add further gameplay to levels and elements to the story.With the exception of perhaps Mirror's Edge, I don't know any first-person interfaces that worked as fluidly or as naturally as this one. Running, jumping and grappling all seem natural and normal and the sense of speed and motion are well conveyed.The game isn't overly long to finish, but I think that adds to it's replayability.Highly recommended."

Although the game is fairly short it makes up for it with good story, good platforming and an awesome world to travel through.While the game starts of easy enough towards the end it begins to ramp up the difficulty quite a bit, although experienced gamers probably still won't find a huge amount of challenge.The games main drawback is that sometimes it is difficult to find out why you failed a jump as for all intents and purposes it seems like you timed everything correctly.The only other negative in the game is the voice acting, although the acting itself is good the actors mispeak some of their lines which can break immersion slightly.Overall, an enjoyable game and well worth the purchase, but if you don't like platforming this game isn't likely to convert you."

The only thing that disappointed me about it was how quickly I got through it, and that was even with numerous repetitions of some of the trickier puzzles. The game is a beautifully rendered, first-person platform physics puzzler...of a sort. I would have never recommended a first-person platformer before this game, but A Story About My Uncle pulls it off with unexpected grace and polish, and has quite a lot more story than anything I've seen Coffe Stain put out so far. I got a good satisfying three hours or so out of it before I beat the main story (which was great!), but the time trials, and hunting down all the collectibles didn't really tickle my fancy, so unless more main game content comes out for it, I'll probably never pick it up again, sad to say. I really wanted to explore the beautiful mysterious world this game is set in; a world inhabited by an infant race and strange monsters. I wanted more story, dad! I could have seen this easily being a series of bedtime stories about the father's adventures in his quest to find his uncle, but alas, can't have everything I suppose. In short: Great free-flying grapple-beaming rocket-booting fun! Might not be worth more than ten bucks for only a couple hours of main gameplay, but certainly pick it up if it goes on sale!"

A Story About My Uncle brings many new and interesting things to videogaming and furthers the genre described as ""walking trail"" games. I highly recommend this to anybody who tires of consuming the samey, prosaic videogames.The story, though sparse, is quite unique. It's about becoming a father, of all things. Plot points lay scattered around the long paths. As you stumble upon these nuggets the narrator, a father telling a bedtime story, exposits about his uncle Fred or the given situation. By searching out your uncle, you get a glimpse of person your character grows into. Pretty sneaky.Controls are tight, if a little counter-intuitive at first. Jumping platforms requires a mixture of spacebar for regular jumps and right mouse button for bigger jumps. It is very disorienting, and I expended a good deal of grey matter mitigating this scheme the entire game. Swinging fom exposed rock like Joey Ramone works much easier, however. Factoring in some rocket boots from the later stages and getting around proved to be fun.Fun, yes. Miles and miles of fun streching out along corridors textured very much the same. Fun swinging puzzles repeated with tiny variations over and over again. Hmm. My sarcasm button must be broken on this board. A Story About My Uncle paces itself poorly in places. Too often, the reward for solving a challenging puzzle is another puzzle or a small, mute walk to the next row of platforms. A tiny gripe, but I can't count the number of times I'd wished to just reach the destination.Overall? It's new. It's different. It's Indie. It's rough around the edges, sometimes literally. You could carve glass with some of these pointy character models. However, A Story About My Uncle brings something new to the party and we're collectively richer for it.10/10 Suitable for snobbery."

The game has you grappeling fom point to point, going at fast velosities at times, and solving the platforming puzzles while going at those speeds, which was a blast (Don't worry, like ""LIMBO"" it's a trial and error game, meaning that you can restart at the last checkpoint if you mess up.)  The graphics are an artform in of itself, and the story got me right in the feels.  The only thing I would dislike about the game was the voice acting of some of the characters are bad, ,and some character models aren't really moving around that mutch when on screen, but dosen't in any way affect the gameplay.  Overall, I enjoyed the game, and recomends to anyone who wants to play platformers like this.NOTE 1: Haven't Tried the speedruns just yet, but I will soon enough.NOTE 2: (+) means that the Pros/cons outway it's counterpart8.5/10PROS (+)+Graphics and Level Design+Heartwarming/Amazing Story+Platforming GameplayCONS-Voice Acting can be a bit Iffy at Times-Character Models not Really Life-Like at Times"

,Recommended,278360,19353455,"Posted: 28 November, 2015",all,Blond,"A Story About My Uncleis a linear platformer in which a man tells his daughter about the day he went to find his uncle Fred, who had been gone for a few months, but never gave any news.Story, game length and replayabilityThe game's story is interesting, and even though it's pretty short (according to steam, it took me 2.3 hours to finish the main story) and simple, you do want to understand what's going on in the very weird world the games takes place in. As stated above, the game is pretty short, but it does offer some hidden objects that give you access to new story elements and a race mode, which I haven't tried, but I personally don't feel like playing this game as fast as possible would be that fun.GameplayThe gameplay is pretty simple : hold right-click to charge up your suit, giving you a super jump on release or a leap if you're running and use left-click to grapple onto something. The way you make your way through the levels is prety unique and fun, but it does get boring fairly quickly. One thing that bothered me though is that you sometimes can't see the rocks you're gonna have to grapple to next, so you have to find them while in mid-air, which often end up in you falling to your death and feels a little bit frustrating since there's nothing you ould've done to avoid that death.Other considerationsThe graphics in this game are pretty impressive. It isn't the most beautiful game ever, but it does look really good. The characters are well made and the environments are really beatiful, especially when you're not stuck in a cave (which sadlt isn't the case for a very bg portion of the game).ConclusionA Story About My Uncleis a pretty good game overall. I do recommend buying it, but I'd advise waiting for it to get on sale, mostly because it is pretty short. Next time you're home alone and don't know how to fill up your evening, you should definitely consider playing this. Finally, I highly recommend playing the whole game in a single session, as I feel like stopping halfway through it will break the immersion pretty bad."

In fact the controls are so good that when you fall, its not the games fault, its yours. This is nice because it provides a challenge without being brutally hard. I highly recommend this game, simply for the gameplay.The story is good, nothing groundbreaking, but provides a means to an end.The world itself is beautiful. The detail is immaculate and interesting. Although its a very linear game, there are times where you have to get from point A to B, but you can take different pathes finding a flow in gameplay that works for you. Some paths are more challenging while others are easier, therefore it gives you the option as to what route you want to take.The only complaint I have is with the voice acting and character models. The voice acting is all over the place, sometimes I was enthralled by what the characters/narrator was saying, while other times I had to cringe at the long, drawn-out unneeded pauses. The character models really don't match the surrounding environment, which was kind of disappointing. The character models are bland and flat, with little detail and didn't necessarily feel like they fit the world.All-in-all the character models and voice acting are relatively unimportant  for the game, I mean the voice acting provides the story, but other than that its all about the gameplay, which this game has perfected.

This game clocks in at about 3 hours. So, the story was kept simple enough to fit that time. It didn’t make me really feel anything. It was a good story, don’t get me wrong, but it just didn’t make me emotional and wasn’t something I really connected to. Now, with that being said, I really did enjoy the story. Simple, clean, and had a nice after credit scene to wrap everything up. Now, some pros and cons.Pro:- Artistically beautiful- Amazing soundtrack- Simple story- Short gameCons:- Having to repeat the same puzzle over and over. This was one of the main issues I had with the game. I’d be stuck for 30 minutes on the same puzzle, not because I didn’t know how to solve it, but because if you were a centimeter off of your target, you would fail and have to start over again. Or, if you drifted too far away from your target, you’d fall and have to start over again, which really sucked.- The character models looking really weird. They looked very angular (not in the good way), and was kind of off putting considering the environments. The environments looked 1000x better then the character models, and that threw me off while playing. Not enough to be a distraction, but enough to bug me a little.- The main character height. This game is an FPS, and it looked like our guy was 2 feet tall. I understand that he’s supposed to be a child, but when it looks like my knees are in the ground, it’s a major issue. For example: Among The Sleep you play as a baby and it looks like the babies knees are not in the ground. When we play a character that’s about 9 (I’m guessing, they never say how old he is), he shouldn’t be 2 feet. Maybe 4′5″ or something, but not 2 feet.- The transition between game play and cut scenes. The only issue I have with this is that you couldn’t run around. Which I understand why, but when my character goes from a run to a crawl, it really stops the flow of the game. The cut scene walking was also slower then our character actually walking.Overview:This isn’t a bad game. It’s a really cool idea that needs a little bit of fixing. Other then that, I have no problem with the game. I’m really impressed at how it turned out, considering I didn’t really have high expectations going into it. When I wasn’t wanting to murder my character for not grappling to things correctly, it was quite fun and adventurous. I’d recommend this to players 10-13ish. I find that that demographic would love this game more then I did. Was very enjoyable, but would get too frustrating.7.8/10"

I was later led to disappointment as I realized just how little story there actually is and that the game relies on using cliffhangers to keep the player going. I was fine with this until I completed the game and was left quite unsatisfied. The game made me very eager to see just what would happen next as I swung from stage to stage hoping that I'd get some dialogue. The ending left me quite disappointed as I saw the developer could've done much more with the game. A lot of players have trouble with this game (refer to the other reviews for this, mostly the negative). I find that this is what gives players their play time. The developer is asking $13 for a game that could take a player 1-3 hours to complete (depending on just how much they die).-----------------------------------------------------Pro/Con VersionPros- What little dialogue there is can drive your curiosuity enough to keep you playing.- Amazing atmosphere.- Fun gameplay.Cons- Very little dialogue.- 1-3 hours of gameplay.- Monotone narrator/unconvincing voice actors (don't let the narrator's beautiful voice fool you!)- Massive price tag for how long the game is.-----------------------------------------------------Conclusion: I'd say get it on sale, it's a very fun game however its price tag is just quite demanding. For a story based game the story really isn't there; the atmosphere is. You could get something that'll get you more for your buck elsewhere."

Landscape is like a mix of Tak 2, Rayman, and Jak and Daxter. It's a pretty short game, so you should probably get it on sale.

The way how the player proceeds through the levels is pretty enjoyable too, and - as somebody said - makes you feel free as you fly among rocks, ice and fluctuating villages. The storytelling is excellent, it really makes you feel part of the story. The only things I would have liked to see are two: firstly, it would have been interesting to have characters interact with you in a more engaging way, as only Maddie seems to create a real bond with the protagonist. This may have been made on purpose, though, so to have the player creating a special relationship with her. In a second instance, the ending would have been more enjoyable if letting the character a bit deeper into the reasons why the ending was to be like that. The ending itself could have been pretty different and more tricky for the player. It's fine and poetic as it is, but a longer and intenser engagement with what was to happen would have created a better climax and would have impacted the player and challenged him/her into reflecting about it. As it is, the ending is way too fast to leave a significant mark in the overall experience.PS: It also runs smoothly on my laptop, which is 2.6GHz dualcore and 4GB Ram, so not too powerful"

You can see every detail that went in to making this game, from the incredible views of floating islands, to ethereal-esque stalactites of the frozen caverns.Although I haven't finished the game yet (Due to a slow computer), I've enjoyed every minute so far.The storyline is rather great, albeit not perfect (But most games haven't perfected a storyline anyway), it has some great high-points, but the narrator is a little deadpan.I'd recommend this game to any Portal/Talos Principle fan, but be warned some of the stunts you have to do are quite difficult and not all that straight-forward.But there are some cons here, for starters, it's windows only. And another, (as with any game) there are some glitches that can be used to unfairly get past areas. But besides the few cons it has, it's a great game overall.For the price ($12.99 as of 7/15/16), it's a good deal.

Propelling yourself through the air and running through the levels is a lot fun while it lasts. The story, while simple is engaging and it has a satisfying and moving ending with a sutble message behind it. Its not perfect though. The grappling can be unresponsive at times and the game seems to change the rules of grappling occasionally. Sometimes you can grapple rocks and walls from far away. Other times you have to be close in order to grapple. the voice acting in the game is not at all great. Its pretty bad at points. The game is also VERY short. You can beat it in one sitting, and after you do there isnt much reason to return. There are time trials, but its of the same levels from the main game and do not really add anything. Especially since there is no online leader boards to see other peoples times. Overall, the game is good.

You Play a role as a Father telling a story, and are bound to tell that story.  You can not Explore or adventure around as much as you may like, or think you will be able to, as there is only one direction you can go in the game.* Lastly, There was not enough Interactable content in the game to really Peak my interest, as The only thing's you could interact with was the story's Main protagonists, and the collectibles.  This is kind of sad as an adventure game goes.  It would have been nice to see more of a side story displayed in items, journals, citizens, etc...  Sadly the only 2 places that had this was the Village at the beginning and His workshop, After that it was just a Story that you were forced to follow that had no, ""Adventuring"", as it may claim.----------------------------Over all, This game is pretty decent at the Cost of $2.59.

The fast paced parkour constrasts well with the developing story as you progress through the game, it immerses you to feel determined to find your uncle and motivates you to keep going through this seemingly never-ending parkour map which can get difficult at times. The ending was emotional but somewhat disappointing,there seemed to be so much potential for another story to unfold, but instead your uncle sends you back home to your disappointment and the game ends there.

The storyline, while it may seem generic and weak at first, had my eyes welling up with tears by the time the story was drawing to a close. as someone who likes to read into clues, and phrases that seem to have no ulterior meaning the story seems to have at least two different endings. The characters do seem to be a bit shallow at times, but the major ones have some character devolpment that feels organic, realistc, and natural.

The physics are horrendous and that's one of the most important part of a platformer. From what I can tell, there's a lot of gravity despite how flighty the jumping and grappling is. That is to say, you fly up very fast, float for a bit, and then accelerate downwards very fast. It's hard to get a feel for it, especially when all the puzzles require fairly quick timing. A little too late or early and you'll plummet to your death.It's a fun game within that, at least. The story seems forced and the narration is sporadic, but worth a play if you can get it on sale. Part of the reason I'm not recommending it is that is has such high reviews despite these problems--I think you SHOULD get the game, just not with high hopes for a masterpiece."

It's only about 3 hours long (I would assume around 4 or five if you get all the collectibles and do time trials) and replayability here is very low. But don't get me wrong- it's not bad because of that. It does have flaws, like having great checkpoints in the first 2 hours and in the end they think it adds more of a ""challenge"" to have bad checkpoints. The core FPPlatforming has 2 solid mechanics and an iffy 3rd one, with an element in the last section of the game (recharging spots on the walls for your grapple) but the hit detection made the ending challenge one of the most infuriating things I've ever played.Other than that, the story is cute with a heartfelt ending, the art direction is great (except for character models that are rough at best.)

Not a great one though: the story is cheesy and dialogues uselessly long, therefore boring (although I find the epilogue a very nice touch), the character design could definitely have been better, and navigation in these dark levels is sometimes unclear.But the mechanics and corollary feelings are very pleasant, and besides the aformentioned flaw levels are finely designed and never on the hard core side; plus, most of them are gorgeous.I believe the game deserves more praise for its gameplay and visuals than its story, hence the title is misleading and might prevent potential customers who would love its gameplay, to even watch the trailer."

A story about my uncle is an adventure game where you go through caves, villages and monsters to do nothing but look for your hipster gay uncle who's been smoking. (Check my screenshots if you want further proof). If you have anger management, or a hard time controlling your temper, this game is not for you as there are many situations after knowing exactly what you have to do that you will get ♥♥♥♥ed by some dumb pixel of ice that will make you slip off, which will ""evaporate"" all your hard work to get there. I have personally raged allot while playing this game, but the rage isn't going to change my mind about it being a GREAT game. The anger I had while playing this game was simply motivation to continue and to accomplish whatever I was having trouble with. The game has multiple sentimental moments and multiple surprising moments which encourage you to keep going, well it did for me anyways.Now to talk about the actual gameplay:Pros:-The game doesn't take that much space-Easy and simple story to understand-Reasonable price-Doesn't take a super computer to be run-Events in the game that make you wanna keep going!Cons:-It's a short game, only takes a few hours to complete which is significantly short compared to other adventure games-Random frame drops when you go near fire/smoke, well for me at least. Which is really nothing so this shouldn't really be considered a con, but I couldn't find anything else!Overall rating: 8.5/10"

When asked for something new, your character decides to tell her about an adventure he had as a kid, looking for his uncle who had gone missing. After finding a specially-made suit tailored to him and the pad his uncle used to dispose of ""trash"" that was used to build houses and such for these bipedal, frog-like creatures.You get on this pad and get launched into the sky, soon finding yourself in some sort of cave.You go through this new world and meet a few people, all leading you closer to, you guessed it, your uncle.Now, there are some downsides.-The voice acting is good, but with the thick accents, it kind of messes up the flow of things.-Only one section, which is in part of the Ice Cave is actually frustrating, but it stilltakes entirely too much to cross the gap.-There are a few minor bugs, but nothing too bad, so only .5 of a con.-The ending was too short. You only see the person who is the focus of the game for about a minute before never seeing him again. I know they say ""It's not about the desination, it's about the journey."" But this was f---ing insane.-He's your uncle and refers to you as his nephew the entire time you see him, but as you launch away from the crystal pad, he says ""Good luck, son!"" or something along those lines. Just a minor continuity error. Could have said ""My boy"" or ""Nephew"", or anything like that, but there was a bit more emphasis on ""Son"", so I was confused by it.Overall, it's a great game with only minor problems, and I would love to see more of this. Not like people jumping on a bandwagon, but just Coffee Stain doing a longer, better-voiced game like ASAMU. I'd recommend it."

It is obvious that the story line was added in to fit the gameplay mechanics, as it is choppy and not very relevant, however this is not a game one plays for story content. Rather, the mindset should be taken that this game introduces a very interesting core mechanic and uses it efficiently and reather cleverly to provide the player with unique challenges, as well as opening up a definitive opportunity to speed-run a game. The engine seems have a few problems running the fairly non-demanding game on low-end machines, but it otherwise well constructed.

The music fits in very well with the environment, and attributes to the overall relaxing atmosphere of the game. Though there are some very challenging moments, for the most part, the game is very laid-back, and I can see myself going back to replay levels in the future. The game took me around two hours and ten minutes to beat, and that may certainly (and understandably) not be a time with which most people are spend over $10, but I still think it's at least worth grabbing on a sale if so.

Most of the time there's only a single floating rock you can use as an anchor, so you haven't got a choice - it even shows you exactly where you have to shoot (the glowing symbols on the rocks), and if you try anything different you fall and die.

,Recommended,278360,21932020,"Posted: 19 March, 2016",all,thepowerglove,"Fun, short, not without its problems, an interesting first-person platformer with some mild puzzle influence.Pros:Good sense of movement and weight.A fair bit of freedom to tackle many challenges how you would like.Good looking world design.Most textures are superb.Lots of fun hidden things to find.No combat keeps the pace on track.Cons:Dollar bin voice acting. Almost feels like non-native speaker's parody of English.Writing is super inconsistent.Glitchy, often getting stuck in the environment.Meh:Story is cute but doesn't go anywhere.End is blah.Music's OK.Your NPC companion's model and animation are both really janky.Most achievements aren't worth the huge effort.Some parts are trial and error/blind jumps, but not usually to the point of unfairness.The game fits right in a snug spot between FPS speedrun games like various Counter Strike modes or Dead Core and walking simulators such as Gone Home or Dear Esther (which is referenced.) Don't play for an amazing story, play for a fun swing through neat looking locations and I believe you'd enjoy it.Overall: 7/10"

I am a bit dissapointed that it was so short, but I was satisfied with it in the end.I recommend that if you just want a short story to play through, then go ahead and pick up this game. Just don't expect for it to last too long.I smell a sequel, or at least a spiritual successor on the horizon."

Story is pretty basic, not overly compelling and probably could've been okay even without it. A bit simple at times, but interesting mechanics and worth buying on a sale if for nothing other than the mechanics and the visuals."

The gameplay is smooth and the levels are well thought out, the game is relatively short however, only lasting about an hour and a half to 2 hours at most."

The story was amazing and although it was short and silmple, I still loved it. The game took me under 3 hours to complete so if you're looking for a long game then this isnt for you. Is it worth £1.99? definitely. But £9.99? the game is far too short to be priced at that in my opinion. I would highly recommend this game but I would wait until its on sale as I dont believe that full price is worth it"

Also you can play up to 2 hours before refunding so playing about an hour can give you an idea of whether you want to keep trying or not."

Overall I really like how you progress and unlock more stuff to your suit. It's been hard but it's been fun as all hell.Now on to a few negatives: I Completed the game in only 2 hours. These 2 hours have, however, been very well spent but I'd like to have it longer.The ending... Don't get me started. I Was dissappointed, mildly spoken. However, last place/cutscene gave me goosebumps. But if you're very excited for the ending, don't be. It's really nothing special.However I friggin' love this game and the stages. I Really recommend this game."
