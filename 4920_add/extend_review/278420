,Recommended,278420,17427235,"Posted: 7 August, 2015",all,Wickerbottom,"I have been waiting for this game to come out on Steam since I had the chance to play it at Fantastic Arcade. This was the standout game of that event for me. I had a lot of fun playing it with the arcade controls setup. It's just as fun for the PC thankfully. The controls are easy to use and you find yourself quickly trying to make more interesting webs and jumps and tricks.The artwork in this game feels like you are playing a puzzle inside of a classic book. I really like that you can allow the game to use your I.P to find out where you are and it adjusts the game to your area. If it's night/day... what weather you have going on, it will all reflect exactly the same in the game (which affects what kind of insects appear and how the level ambience is)This game is not only a fun puzzler but has clues for you to find along the way which unravel the story of the setting around you. I never thought playing a game about being a spider catching bugs would be fun but it's pretty addictive. Check out some footage on youtube if you are considering getting this game. If brain teasers are your thing, I recommend this game.10/10 - you can shish kabob insects as you jump around like spiderman"

Catching bugs is cool (dofferent bugs needs different techniques), Revealing the story even cooler.Not to mention that in-game weather changes according to that in your location (as the game says ""looking through your window"") - this is scary. Looking at the world through spider's lens is exciting!Music is not good thou. It doesn't add anything to the game theme (neither to spider story nor mansion story)."

,Recommended,278420,17450779,"Posted: 8 August, 2015",all,Chernobog,"A really cool little game I learned about on r/spiders of reddit. Basically, you play a cute little jumping spider with leaping abilities to put Jordan to shame and the ability to make webs once a geometric pattern of criss crossing silk has been made. You use these webs to catch wandering bugs (many with different AI patterns), such as flies and crickets, while other techniques, such as tackling, are needed to take down hornets. Similarly, these insects give you more silk to work with as your supply is finite. You make use of the web's design and the insects you eat to get points as you clear your way to the next area. Meanwhile, there's secrets to be found throughout the stages as you try to uncover the background story of the manor you're hunting in.The game is one of those 'easy to learn, hard to master' sorts. You have to plan out the best way to keep your point modifiers high (leaping web from web, instead of touching the ground) and you need to strategize how to make your approach, which is made harder with obstacles, finite resources, and bugs that don't necessarily stay where you want them to. All of this adds up to a surprisingly cerebral game.Sure, people who don't like spiders or bugs to point of burning their house down and screaming like a little girl miiiight not like the imagery used, but nothing is terribly graphic. The imagery is realistic, but don't expect to see more macabre stuff for the most part. There's really a damn good title to be had here that I don't think will squeam out the nervous crowd too much.There's a lot to do in this game, from the planning, to figuring out the web physics, finding secrets, unlocking new spider skins(!), and even getting a bestiary of sorts of the insects you've defeated on a small board, where you can see a little information about them. Btw, this game utilizes an option to mirror the local weather and time of day of your ISP's location (assuming you allow it), so you might play in Spider's world during a night time rain storm or on a clear sunny day, given your location. How cool!I have nothing but good things to say about this title, honestly. I wish the developers the best and hope they make more content for Spider. I think the only thing I can give as constructive criticism is I would have preferred a slightly more involved tutorial for the various mechanics of the game. It can be fine to figure out things on your own but some bugs don't get special descriptions concerning what needs to be done versus others, for example."

,Recommended,278420,17468679,"Posted: 9 August, 2015",all,Rasterradio,"An awesome game! Not an easy beast to descibe; it's a puzzle game, but not in the traditional, Tetris/Portal sense; it's a platformer where you have to plan out your actions; it has environmental storytelling comparable to Gone Home and Bioshock, and it's much more than the sum of its parts. If you're writing this game off as 'casual' or 'simplistic' I'd strongly advise you to look up a gameplay video and think it over--it's a testament to the strengths of Tiger Style that they've managed to make such a deep game while keeping the experience as streamlined as possible."

I just love being a spider and crawling through places that you would never notice as a human. Eating all the bugs is very satisfying, especially when you get a bunch of them into one web and then eat them all at once. I just hope they add more levels or something because I feel acomplished now that I've eaten all the insects and gotten the highest score I could on each level. I also solved all the mysteries, and I really enjoy being able to play as different kinds of spders. I'd give it a 7/10 if steam had a good review system. But they dont so I'll recommend it. However, I just hope that they aadd more content soon because I just breezed through all the levels with ease. If they end up adding DLC or more levels or something. Then I'll give it a 10/10."

The first release of Spider (The Secret of Bryce Manor) is one of my favorites to date, and the changes they've made in the newest release are amazing.This is a much beefier game than the first.  Bryce Manor was more exploratory, and hints of story were revealed as your spider progressed through each section of the house.  However, this game has puzzles, levels that can be replayed for different results (and bugs) depending on the time of day and weather.  That it uses your local time and weather in the game is, well, nifty.  :-)  Some of the levels are a real challenge, too. I'm not a hardcore gamer and am making my way through.  So, don't be scared.About the weather, there's also a weather/time machine that you can use periodically.  I'm glad they included this because it's not likely to rain in Central Texas anytime soon, and that would mean I'd have to wait weeks to play some of the levels.As of now, I've already played nearly 8 hours, and I would have played more if it weren't for that pesky job.  :-D  This game will keep me busy for awhile, and I'm enjoying every minute.  Thank you, Tiger Style."

76561197983247673,Recommended,278420,17482435,"Posted: 10 August, 2015",all,Montage,I played the original spider on my iphone and loved it. I bought the new one on steam and wasn’t sure how it would play on the PC but I can definitely say I was pleasantly surprised. Playing with the mouse and keyboard is fantastic. The art is absolutely gorgeous and even though I’m not that far into the game yet there are already new insects and a collection wall to keep track of all of them. From the looks of it there are a lot. There is also a top down play mode which is a very cool change of pace. Spider is easy to play but has lots of depth to gameplay. I highly recommend it!
,Recommended,278420,18816314,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,flashwitt,"I came across this gem in the halloween sale, whilst 'bobbing for apples'- you know... cruising through the bargain bins looking for something that is amazing and costs 12 cents?  This did not cost 12 cents, in fact it was signifigantly more than my planned apple-bob-budget, but the moment I got a peek at the trailer I knew I had to have it.  It's beautiful, aesthetically, it's simple, functionally, it's challenging, contemplatively... I'd say, get this game even if you're arachnophobic. Maybe even ESPECIALLY if you are- because It might help.My only very small complaint might have been that this game is fairly hard-wired to WASD- but they were considerate, and pre-implemented arrow-pad functionality for those of use who are WASD-challenged. Everything else? Perfect.  Spider:Rite of the Shrouded Moon is delicious!"

Not only have I never seen a game where you actually can play a spider but also has some good gameplay. Easy to play and much enjoyable. The music is a bit irritating though.Also to find the hidden secrets you need to pay attention during playing. The connection to the moon phases was just an awesome idea!The end is heart breaking and worming at the same time :)

,Recommended,278420,29858013,Posted: 11 February,all,Noven,"A neat chill puzzle game you can play at your own pace whenever. For what it is, there's lots of content and fairly substantial variations with local weather and day/night cycle. Very relaxing to play slowly but it also has some more speed-oriented mechanics if you really want to push for max score.The atmosphere & sound, art direction, controls and everything come together nicely to be pretty unique, and I think the trailer gives a good representation of the strangely satisying feel - don't expect much in-game voiceover though, the lore is minimal and in the background.A really cool thing to just start up and play for half an hour once in a while, and it seems to go on pretty deep sale often."

It's simple enough, controls fine enough, and it's pretty entertaining. I think the soundtrack alone is enough reason alone to get it, it's very lovely and makes me a little nostalgic."
