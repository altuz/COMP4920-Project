It's a physics puzzle game about gravity. The gravity simulation works well and it has a very nice minimalistic presentation. In addition to simply solving the levels you can try for a high score by keeping your satellite in orbit for as long as possible.The dev plans to add a daily challenge which is always nice.. Will update review once out of Early Access, but if you enjoy these sorts of games don't worry about it being in Early Access."

Yes, it keeps you from floating away, and it makes going to the bathroom a whole lot less disturbing, but I'm telling you - it's the force of the devil. Don't agree? Think about it - how many times have you dropped something on your foot, or fallen down stairs? Exactly! Without gravity, this would not happen!So, imagine my evil laugh when I discovered a game which would allow me to defeat gravity, and better - use it to fly my little spacetriangle further, and longer in the galaxy of 0RBITALIS.This game, is unique. And that gives it a great charm - added to by the really nice art style and audio.I like puzzle games, and I like space - this game has both things in abundance. The puzzle elements are challenging but not impossible, which is great.I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for something a bit different, yet strangely familiar in feel, or who like a challenge.Also, if like me you are suspicious of gravity, then it's a must play!"
,Recommended,278440,10295643,"Posted: 30 May, 2014",all,Mykwon,"Very nice game! Pretty addictive, great physics, innovative challenges.Here are my suggestions:1. Keep the background music playing while orbiting. No music while watching the particle orbiting feels kind of empty. Maybe the music could also change depending on the action. Example: goes faster as the particle goes faster, or as the time passes; maybe with a special effect when a personal best is reached2. Put the timer counting somewhere on the screen right after firing. It will be much more thrilling to see the timer going while orbiting than waiting for the round to finish to know the end time3. If a level has been completed, that the player replays the level to try to have a better time and fails miserably (i.e. before the required time to pass is fulfilled), he shouldn't be treated with a round restart as if he had never passed the level (therefore not seeing the leaderboard and not having the option to go to the next level). He should be brought to the leaderboard so he can go to the next level if he wants as he may have failed now but he beat the level already and therefore has the right to go to the next level if he wants4. An outer ring that shows where is the limit before the particle is considered lost in space. It would be more thrilling to see the particle getting closer and closer of the ring limit, hoping another particle will have enough attraction to bring it back into the game5. Of course, achievements. When achievements are implemented, if a player by his previous games has fulfilled one, it should be granted immediately (example: make it #1 on a leaderboard)6. More levels with specific goals to accomplish, like the last levels where you have to touch lines to make the progress bar move in order to pass the level7. Nice to have, better graphics, especially better effects (flash, blur, etc.)"

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this title and how much I wanted to replay certain levels in order to get a better orbit.Its only drawback is the moments when the music (filled with very serviceable electronic tracks) ceases and you are met with the game's ""silence"" track. The more you listen to this silence, the more it becomes apparent that someone is breathing into the mic. This is someone who is trying very hard to hold his/her breath but cannot resist taking some deeper breaths now and then. This is creepy."

Often I found myself going COME ON, at the mere micro second of difference between finishing a level and failing. This to me added a level of 'I can do this"" with each level I came across.The graphics, forgettable. The sound, nearly none existant.

You do this by launching whatever this device is (a square) into the level using whateve robjects available to effect gravity and therefore, hopefully, have a good alignment to prevent collisions with the previous mentioned random object/s.Thats really it. And yet it is addictively fun! Found myself flustered yet determined with this game to progress with each level.The graphics simple, what u need to get what u want done. But for some reaosn it is a graphics hog, even with my power house I found it hanging.....Sound forgettable....it has sound?Replaybility...well..it's a puzzle game, so thats determined on your own desire to finish each level....but once finished I can say most likely little desire to come backConcept...nice niche game fun to pick up and put down....Fun...absolutely.....simple yet elegant....So overall...worth your time..it's not a monumental game at all....but in the field of puzzle games its original, inventive, and addictive....if u like puzzle games with a new approach check it out."

You may find yourself spending a long time attempting to figure out difficult levels. Cons- Can become monotonous as the variety of the puzzles begins to feel less pronounced, however with the introduction of custom levels and an editor this expands the variety and orginality of level strategy.Sound: Pros- The sound effects do plenty to help immerse you into the themery of the game. There is little music to speak of perhaps to this games overall benifit. Cons- for those who expect games to have solid soundtracks, you will not find one here.Graphics: Pros- The graphics are fairly basic for your average puzzle game however they do a good job creating a solid and immersive theme. Cons- Overall their arent very many assets in this game which can sometimes contribute to the monotonous repetitive feeling the game can provide at times.Features: Pros- The game has a very straightforward set of features, basically your standard puzzle game format. Direct level progression with increasing difficulty. Recent addition of a level editor adds variety to the original game. Cons - For those who enjoy a wider berth with game types such as time attack or challenge modes will not find that here. There are however leaderbordes and statistics for comparison to other players.Settings and Options: Pros- Has options for basic graphical quality for a wider selection of computers to be able to operate this game.

,Not Recommended,278440,20012544,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,Tank Buddy,"As a space enthusiast, I was very excited to play a gravity/orbit based puzzler. Unfortunately, this game does not provide a worthwhile experience.First of all, the game is locked at 30 FPS and does not have a settings menu. You can only swap between preset graphical options with the “q” key. And it doesn’t tell you what settings level you are on- the difference is so minute it’s hard to tell anyways. The real killer is the actual way the game is displayed- the area the gameplay is displayed isn’t in a 16:9 or even 4:3 aspect ratio. While this makes sense in terms of level design, the developers didn’t even bother to put the scoreboard or any additional information on either side of the square game window (this is in full screen). The color scheme is bland and the edges of the playable screen are grey and blurry. It isn’t a pretty game by any means.In terms of gameplay, 0RBITALIS is decently entertaining at first, but it gets stale when you have to start guessing and testing for several minutes just to get your orbits right. You’d figure on a desktop game will very little graphical demand they would at least have an option to show a much longer projected path, but you are left with one that approximates around 2-3 seconds into the future. Once you launch the projectile, it is at the mercy of the not-impressive gravity simulation.I really hoped that I could enjoy this game. But I can't reccomend it. Did I mention it runs on Flash?"

I liked it more than I thought, but I will probably never play it again after this review so I have to not recommend it for most people. Some could find enjoyment here, so here's the good, the bad, and the ugly (also bad):The good:A unique premise for a puzzle game.The music fits the game well. Some of the music slightly reminds me of music from the 2002 film, Solaris.Simple control scheme that doesn't get in the way of gameplay.The ability to see where other players launched, but that is also a double-edged sword I feeel (see below).The bad and the ugly:It's basically a 'guess where to click to make you orbit the longest' game. The precision of your launces is pretty much down to twitch gaming (click at the exact right moment in time and space).It's very difficult to intuit what a good launch point is. Maybe the game just has one of those learning curves, but even after an hour of play, I felt like I was just mostly randomly guessing.Seeing other players launch positions is helpful, but it feels like a crutch to make up for the ability as a player to 1) really get an intuitive feel for good launch positions, and 2) be able to precisely determine those launch positions.The graphics are nothing special. We're talking about the simplest of geometric shapes and vector graphics.Sometimes the speed of your launched satellite is so fast, you can see the line segments of your orbit. You can see the individual line segments rather than a smooth curve. Seems very sloppy.The game gets repetitious pretty quickly. While some new gameplay elements are added (like a 'planet' that repulses instead of pulls in like normal gravity), it just doesn't change up the ""guess where to click"" mechanic of the game very much.Having said that, I still found enjoyment in this game far longer than I though I would have. I'm satisfied with the game overall, but I got it heavily discounted while on sale. As of this review, the game is sitting with a $10 USD price tag, and I find that horribly overpriced. I can't see paying more than $3 USD (or your regional equivalent) for a game like this. There just isn't enough substance here to justify that price in my opinion.Overall: 6/10.Get it if it's on sale and you like orbital simulations, spacey ambient music, and puzzle games.

It is an orbital mechanic puzzle game, where you launch your mass around the greater mass, with the slight chance of it hitting a smaller mass, or being slingshot around by it. The objective per level is to figure out where to launch your mass, and have it succesfully orbit around  for at least 5 or so seconds. So the levels can go by quick if you figure it out immediately, but if not, there will be a lot of trial and error, but it can be very forgiving though. In all, for $6.99 (i had a coupon that made it $1.75) it is definately worth it, and definately worth a try."

,Recommended,278440,10368329,"Posted: 6 June, 2014",all,RogueBurger,"A simple game, perhaps better suited for a phone than a desktop. The game consists of small levels containing various types of gravity-altering bodies, and the goal of each level is to launch your little ball of light and have it get somewhere or do something within a certain amount of time (or for as long as possible in some cases). The levels are grouped up in to bunches of 4-5, and each group of levels shares similar mechanics and goals, and entering a new group of levels will introduce you to new mechanics and often change the win-condition of the levels.This brings me to my biggest negative: how to win a level is never explained beforehand. And some of the win-conditions are completely opposite (do X for as long as possible vs do X as quickly as possible). Some you can fogure out after of couple failed attempts, but others might make you sit there for 5 minutes as your ball of light orbits around making you think like you're racking up a super high score, only to have it crash and reveal that you were just wasting your time.There is some skill to the game. I've gotten better at predicting orbits as I've gone through the levels. However, once the levels get to a certain complexity, you really can't predict or plan out your path with any degree of precision or certainty, and it just becomes a crapshoot. A typical later level looks like this: launch your ball in a direction that looks good, watch it orbit for 10 seconds, going in wildly unpredictable directions (in theory it's completely predictable, but when you have 5+ bodies moving around and pulling your ball in different directions at different rates it's next to impossible to do), restart the level, slightly modify your shot, and do it all again. And depending completely on luck, you might beat that level in 5 tries or 50.The scoreboard is a cool feature. It's nice to randomly get an awesome score on a level and see yourself near the top. However, looking at some of the scores, it's hard to argue that it's anything but random. You can't tell me something predicted their 2 minute orbital path before launching.Overall, this is the type of game I play a level or two of for 10 minutes before going to bed. I would never sit down and make a gaming session of this game, nor do I have any incentive to replay levels over and over to go up on the scoreboard. But as a relaxing, wind-down game, it serves its purpose well. I would say this game was definitely worth the ~$1 I paid for it, and I could see myself getting a couple more hours of play out of it."

The next few show you how gravity would've worked if it was broken. I might not call it a true puzzle game since you need pure luck to get to the top of the scoreboard, but it's pretty to look at and easy to play. If it's on discount, get it. You'll probably like it if you don't expect to get past each level on your first try."

However, once the craft is launched, it cannot be controlled, with the gravitational pull of planets and stars taking effect. The minimalist aesthetic and great soundtrack all draw the focus onto the gameplay itself, also being of a mimimalistic approach. It's simple and yet offers a wonderfully enjoyable challege.Despite being Easy Access, the game runs incredibly smoothly, but would appear to have yet to have it's level set complete. It should also be noted that despite offering windowed and fullscreen options, the gamespace is set within a 1:1 aspect ratio, so the full screen view is pillarboxed. The game could well be updated to include a 16:9 ratio in the future however. The addition of Steam Workshop intergration would also seem to be likely in future versions as well."

You shoot a little ball and it's got to stay within the play area for 10 seconds without getting flung into space, or crashing in to an orbital body.It's not a unique concept, but it's one that's unfortunately not executed well. The biggest issue is that, in addition to the various planets and stars moving, often your launch point is moving too. Many levels require fairly precise timing and aim, and because of the variety of things moving around, you'll normally spend most of a puzzle that you've essentially soved firing off into space, or into planets because you haven't gotten lucky enough to fire at exactly the right time at exactly the right speed. It makes the whole thing feel more like an exercise in luck rather than any actual problem solving.There are better, free-er games out there on the web. I'd give this one a pass."

How is the gravity inacurrate?- orbits decay automatically, as if you are experiencing atmospheric drag which doesn't fit the story- celestial bodies pull you to WHERE THEY WILL BE. It should be pulling you always to its current position- there is no aerobraking when you are deep in a planet's atmosphere. you either hit the planet or accelerate around it- super high gravitational constantIf this game had accurate gravity it would be far too easy. Try NOT landing on a planet in KSP. Yeahhh that's how most of my KSP missions end up.This game is a casual time waster for about 30-60mins. Probably better off as a phone app."

Why aren't there options to run at a higher resolution?Orbitalis would be aided by a more precise way of choosing trajectory and power like choosing a trajectory with the mouse and then adjusting it with numbers. Looks like it was designed to be played on your phone and nothing else. Also, there's no way to speed up time. If you fire a good shot you could be sitting there watching it for thirty minutes. That's boring. The game might make some pretty lines but they're not that pretty. If they were bright and crisp it might be better but there's nothing dazzling. The music is pretty generic space tinkling too.I would have enjoyed seeing this in high resolution and full screen and the ability to zoom and something to see if you do zoom.

I kind of feel like it's not that much of an intellect-based game...it seems at first like maybe if you know a lot about astronomy you'd get an edge, but I don't think that's actually the case. It's more about just trial-and-error'ing your way to good times on the puzzles. Not to say that isn't enjoyable, I've killed an hour or two on this game and since it was very inexpensive I think it was totally worth it. It gets some interesting variation as you progress through the game, increasing the difficulty hugely as you get into it.For some bizarre reason I had problems with the graphics - the game ran very poorly at first, despite the fact that it seems like it shouldn't be so hard to run. I pressed 'q' to turn the graphical quality down and it popped right up, ran perfectly smoothly, and since 'Graphical Quality' to this game is just weird grainy filters on everything I didn't mind one bit.So: if you snag it cheaply on a sale, it's worth it for a couple of hours of frustrating fun."

Doseone's sound direction is just absolutely awe-inspiring. (I'll be honest: Doseone was about 60% of the reason I got this game.) The puzzles are a really good mix of difficulty. While they're challenging, they're not infuriating. It also throws in some really cool mechanics each and every chapter. My only gripe is that the game is quite short for the 10$ asking price. It ended really abrupt, too: the last stage, Alpha Omega, is literally impossible to lose (and I do mean literally). I would've liked a final boss-like system, but it just sort of... ended. It made me want more. Thereisa level editor, but it feels like that would buck the game's great level design.When the only problem the game has is how long it is, you've got a gem on your hands.

You can't change the video settings in any meaningful way, so if you have any problems with performance, you're stuck with them. The performance issues I've had don't seem to have anything to do with the power of my machine. You may not have issues with performance at all, but there are much deeper flaws than that. The gameplay suffers from sensitive dependence upon initial condition (AKA ""chaos""). Whether or not you succeed in an attempt has almost more to do with floating point rounding errors than your skill. The same pattern repeats over and over: you play a level a few times, you find an approach that will eventually work, and then you spend several minutes trying it until the timing, aiming, and physics inaccuracies come together in your favor. Could have been great if the game gave the physics time to be properly calculated and gave you fine control over your launching time, speed, and vector, but as it is,the primariy experience of 0RBITALIS is random failure."
