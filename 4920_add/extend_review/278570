FirstSerena, thenCahors Sunset, and nowLabyrinthine Dreams... This is starting to become a habit. I wouldn't like to seem like a tragedy junkie. I just wished to play an RPG maker game, and look what it has done to me: all teary eyed and big with the decision on Carpe Diem!InLabyrinthine Dreams, our protagonist is Beth; a young woman who is crippled with anxiety, due to the timeless death of her father. In many ways, she is terrified that she may end up just like him. She is trying to deal with judgement, apathy and depression while recounting the events of her life from a dreamlike perspective. She travels within many dream fragments that symbolize both important moments of her life and her hopes, dreams and fears: namely her inner world. Within those dreams, she constantly tries to escapes from a monster, a dark creature that comes after her. For every step that Beth takes, the monster can take two. Is she doomed to end up in the grasp of her inner demon despite whatever she tries?The gameplay is the marriage of a visual novel and a refreshing selection of movement puzzles. Puzzles are decent, and takes some time to figure all if you were not to use a guide. I'd like to add that, every detail that you come across, alongside with the nature of puzzles you solve, the game world is genuinely symbolic. You shouldn't expect a straight forward story consistency. The story works around the linear concept that you expect from an RPG maker game. For example: for the first puzzle that you come across - The Forest - you are not allowed to make left turns. It gave me the sense that Beth is forced to abide by the expectations of society: one way only. There should be millions of other paths that she could take to finish the labyrinth, but she is forced to use a single one. Beautifully thought!There isn't much free will, but Beth's tale is so ordinary, so real and everyday; I found no problem on emphasizing myself with the character. The game asks the same question that we ask ourselves everyday: Will I make it? Will it be okay? Am I taking the right decision? Is it foolish to chase a dream? We all are afraid if we do not abide by the rules of the society, and work on a course of 'guaranteed future', we could end up wasting our life after a dream that we shall miss in the end. We all are a 'Beth' when a new day begins.This is a very short game that you should spare the time to take a look at. At the end, I promise you, you'll feel better about whatever your life may hold for you. I know I feel better, and every Beth is a hero.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

The puzzles are mostly standard types, although there is something reminiscent of DROD. If you want an RPGMaker game with a moving story, play To The Moon, and if you want tile-based puzzles, DROD would be a better choice. I think I enjoyed the style of Unemployment Quest a bit more, too - even though both games are basically linear, Unemployment quest let you explore a little whereas this is just puzzles-cutscene-puzzles-cutscene..."

But, the storyline is really something else. It is definitely poignantly arresting, in that it deals with serious issues like loss of health, dreams, family obligations, and whether our future is set in stone from the time we make those first adult choices after High School. Without spoiling the story, I think the most meaningful moments were the sky puzzle, realizing that my days were disappearing as I took each step... I was using time up, so to speak. And, the game is full of such metaphors. You won't just play this game. You will live it. And, you won't forget it.*Unfortunately, now I will have to idle the game for card drops, since I finished it before any dropped."

The story is quite simple and sadly somewhat marred by a narrative that lacks finesse in dealing with its subject matter, you can expect some pretty obvious lines dealing with depression or being stuck in life. The gameplay is decent with mazes you must navigate with limitations on your movement (e.g. can't turn left), other places where you must clear all tiles touching them only once or have to outmaneuver a monster that follows certain movesets.If you like these kind of puzzles and are ok with its simple story then Labyrinthine Dreams is a decent choice considering it's fairly priced for what it does even when not on sale."

As you move on through other puzzles you get to hear a little bit more about the main character and her life struggles. You see how she goes to aim for happiness and also how she conquers her fear. Really touching story.-However, this game is not repetetive; you will most likely just play it one time (Unless you didn't quite understand the story).-The voice acting was okay, i don't feel like too much emotion was put on the most drastic dialouges; felt like the same tone.-Art is great! The images fully went on with the story and were just so full with tranquility.-Music was right on! Perfect melody at the right spots! Though, the enemy's theme was somewhat spooky lol. I literally just wanted to clear the puzzle as soon as possible when i had to escape.-Puzzles tend to be rather quite easy once you have figure out the kind of pattern that is being used in specific puzzles, there is only one way to the exit, can't take any other road but the one assigned for you.I really wanted to know more about her, but it seemed that the only way was by completing puzzles and getting the dialouges , if you interact with objects though she will tell you something about the past. This does not happen frequently though, as they aren't alot of objects to interact with anyways.Furthemore really touching story, worth $5? i believe so Yes! Especially for people using RPG Maker, this can be a quite good example of how to create a game, or even get ideas. I myself have RPG Maker and i'm currently playing games done with RPG to simply learn more about it. In the end, it doesn't hurt to buy this game and use it as a reference."

,Recommended,278570,16051185,"Posted: 28 May, 2015",all,Son of a submariner,"Yet another RPG-maker game that focusses on storytelling rather than classic JRPG-Gameplay. Hence it is part of the game genre that is represented by To the moon and of which you can find games like Richard and Allice, A Bird Sorry or 199X.I’d say that Labyrinthine Dreams can’t compare itself with those games. It doesn’t have the creative brilliance of To the Moon, neither the narrative depth of titles like 199x or Richard and Alice. But that doesn’t mean that it is not as good. It is just a bit different:1)	The gameplay is not build as much around exploring. The main gameplay consists of puzzles in the form of mazes with growing difficulty.2)	It is much shorter. Labyrinthine dreams can be described as one shot that focusses on a simple but moving and quite deep story that lasts for about an hour.Labyrinthine dreams is not an unique outstanding Jewel in your Steam Library but is nevertheless a refreshing attempt to enlarge the genre of “RPG-Maker Stories”. 5€ for an one hour game is an harsh pricing, but it is worth it, at least when it is on sale, if you are into this kind of games."

Everything is done through a series of thoughts and dreams. To progress through this powerful and emotional story you must clear different mazes and puzzles that are themed during her life. This is not as easy as it sounds as some puzzles have limited turns, properly clearing all tiles, logic puzzles or even avoiding demons.The graphics is very colorful and the art is simply outstanding. You have different areas like forests, cities, skys and even dark evil zones. With these areas you have hand drawn art that must be seen to believe. With such great art you have some very unique and often eerie music that complement the story's different moments perfectly. Another treat for players is that this game has fantastic voice acting!Truly this is a fantastic game but a very short one. It can be cleared in a hour or two depending on how fast you can solve puzzles. Even with this fact it takes nothing away from this game. Being that this game was made using the rpg maker engine, I must say that this developer was thinking outside the box and did a fantastic job. I recomend this title to  puzzle fans looking for a quick distraction."

Challenging if you don't pay attention to the rules, however, so no skipping dialogue and zipping ahead!  Well, still a challenge in places, but in a fun way, not a ""zomg, I've headbutted a hole in my wall!"" kind of way, like if you ignore the rules instructions.This is a short but enjoyable maze-puzzle game with trading cards and 7 semi-easy achievements.  It needs at least 2 playthroughs, with the first to map mazes with resets, and 1 playthrough for the no-resets cheevo... or just stare at the pictures-provided guides right here on Steam to do it all in 1 playthrough  =^_^= (found the guide after mapping several mazes  T_T  ).If you like maze-puzzles, want a good game for trading cards, or just another game to 100%, this is your game right here!This game is also good from a story view point, as it chronicles key points in the main character's (Beth's) life.WARNING: If you cry easily, make sure to have a box of tissues nearby, because the story is definitely sad (if you couldn't guess from the ""About"" section of the store page).Lastly, a small sidenote: Usually I don't buy game soundtracks on Steam, but am considering it for this game:  The music in this game is simple, but hauntingly good, and enhances the sob potential in the storyline (at least for me).  No tinny 8-bit music or rock & roll, but soft, haunting (yes, I know I already used that word, but it IS!) melodies that have a noticeably decent quality unusual for most cheap games.I saw the news post on Labyrinthine Dreams' price reduction from whatever it was before (I think $4.99?) to encourage people to not abuse Steam's refund policy, but I would have paid that and then some just for the music, the mazes/gameplay, or the story alone (even better, Steam Trading Cards for Badges!).  All 3, combined with beautiful artwork, makes for a masterpiece equal to or maybe better in some areas than many big-name SNES games (and we know how much money THOSE were, even back in the day!).  I remember paying much more than that for Myst for my PC when it first came out, and accidentally beat THAT game in less than 10 minutes!  As a kid!This game is definitely a wonderful addition to any game library, especially for the (imo way too low) current price tag, and if you normally play games on mute, you'll want to unmute your computer for this game."

It's a short puzzle-adventure game in which you play as a girl struggling with her inner doubts and thoughts, which have manifested into a literal demon that constantly drives her away from her goals and the people she loves. Ludically, this boils down to some traversal puzzles coupled with stages where you outrun a demon in a turn-based maze. Again, not much to it, but it comes together quite well and serves the story.This is also one of the rare moments where a developer knows the advantages of video games as a medium. At the end (SPOILERS), you are running from the demon down a long hallway, which you can't possibly win (becuase the demon moves twice as fast as you). Then, as Beth comes to terms with her past, you can outrun the demon at last (3 spaces per turn to the demon's 2). You can defeat your demon, but you have to keep moving.These are the kinds of things, though a little blatantly obvious here, that you can't really convey in any other medium. The game and story aren't seperate, and so you couldn't tell this story any other way. I really hope Solest Games move on from RPGmaker in favor of something that gives a little more freedom, because these guys could actually push the medium forward."

The writing was incredibly smart, filled with emotion, much like in other short games like To the Moon, but the voice acting gave so much life to the game. The music made the journey so much more mystical. When I was doing the mazes at first, I feared it would be one 3 tracks, but the music changed with the themes of the stages/levels.

I think it tries to convey the message of not losing hope even in the darkest of time through the story of this young girl, who struggles with both life and a chronic and rather fatal disease.The puzzle types seem to reflect the themes of the girl's life. First is the only-turn-right puzzle, which is about the ""right"" choice that society seems to press on us, and on her father and her in the story. Frustrating, but the ""rule"" dictates that it's the only way they can advance.The second puzzle, which actually spans throughout the game, is the battle with her disease, and the rule is very unfair for her.The third puzzle is turning the car in the direction of the arrows. This relates to her father, who died in a car accident. But, through her father and mother's words, things are not quite so.The fourth puzzle is step on all tiles. I think it reflects her dream, to dream high up in the sky and conquer all.The fifth puzzle is when she's free of her body, drifting away in space, finding the way to her ""ship"".The game tries to convey the optimistic message that even all goes wrong, there is still hope, and you can get through it no matter what. A little too optimistic and simple to be honest, but I can't say it's wrong. People are different and complicated, one solution is right for this person may not work on the other, but I value its effort. However, I agrees with one point is that we should try to cherish what's truly important to us, may it be family or dream or whatever, instead of chasing after society's expectation.I'll recommend this game for people who enjoy a good casual story and puzzle game."

Puzzles are challenging enough to keep you key clicking for a while and can be a bit frustrating if your brain isn't firing on all cylinders. Decent between art and nice spirte style. Acted well without being melodramatic about its message. I think I'll enjoy playing it a second time to collect remaining achievements but not sure it has any replayability beyond twice. Overall a nice game for the price.

The story is nothing special, but not too bad either. But the real strength of the game lies inside of the riddles. They\'re very clever made and you need to think really well, to finish each challenge. The game never get\'s too hard, but is never as easy, that it becomes boring. The voice acting is nice, like the music too, but again nothing special. For achievement hunters is to say, 100% is a piece of cake. Trading card collector need to grind for the last card.

Nice gutpunch for all the people that lost a loved one *cough* lost twin to cancer *cough*. Apparently THOSE people didn't try hard enough.Pro:- Feels. So many. Your experience may vary.- Some puzzle mechanics are quite unique, enjoyable for a few minutes.- Easily refundable if that is your wish. I didn't.- If you ARE a person that's depressed/starving artist/currently suffering from illness this might get you the extra push to keep going. Highly unlikely that you'll be surfing games for your emotional support, but still.Torn between a good and bad reccommendation. Making feels is usually quite an achievement for games.

Cheaply enough that I figured if it turned out to be a waste of my time, I wouldn't be out a lot of money.You'll notice that my time played on the game is quite short. How about that.I like puzzles. I play a lot of games with ACTUAL puzzles. But mazes aren't puzzles as far as I'm concerned; there is no brain involved. Here, they've tried to add a little brain by making each set of mazes have a different rule which they don't tell you. Or maybe they try to tell you. I THINK the game was trying to tell me the ""rule"" of the forest maze, but did so in such bad English that it took me three screens to realize the actual rule: In the forest, you can't turn left or back up. That's it.So then I went and looked at some walkthroughs and realized the rest of the game was just more mazes, with a rule change every four maps or so, plus a story which, frankly, seems pretty obvious just from the first few panels of dialogue and the unsubtle clues in the maps (really, IV stands scattered all over the woods, that's the best you can do?). Yeah, yeah, dying, hallucinating, in the hospital, replaying life, trying to figure out whether to go on, monsters from the brain - I've seen that before, seen it done better.Oh, well. That's why I buy 'em cheap.If you're really dying to see how this story comes out (ha, ha) go watch a walkthrough. Even at the tiny price this isn't worth it."
