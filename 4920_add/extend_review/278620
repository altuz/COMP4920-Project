However, This game is lacking a variety of things to a rogue-like procedural death/dungeon crawler. Here is a small list: An inventory, Some sort of skill tree and leveling up system, new clothing/armor, and a variety of weapons. it does not provide neither a small nor large variety of weapons, only three.Here is a list of a few obnoxious things that you're going to encounter, if you make the horrid mistake in purchasing this. Number one: the enemies bunch up and beat you to a pulp, even if you run they will FIND YOU; The dungeons have the same pattern, you beat two levels and then you move onto the horde stage where you must find the gem keys, unlock all the doors and unleash the horde, then you escape. They have you repeat the same mundane task over and over again. The voice acting is great while the fighting style is very repetitive and uninteresting. Sadly this is one of the worst rogue like game I have played. Fifteen bucks for a game like this is not worth it, I'd save my money for something of more value. Sadly it is a poorly executed game."

It's good and not at all tiny considering the price.EDIT: Game definitely has some cool boss fights and powerups. Final boss has insta death attacks so no matter how strong you get he will kill you if you don't learn his patterns.

Movement is also slow and awkward.Seems to be a design decision, so you can get bonuses that e.g. increase backwards movement speed, but I just really dislike the way the game feels.The camera is also set up awkwardly. It's kind of a weird hybrid of over the shoulder and top-down."

Or is it?Fine! i was thinking about doing a review from another game, but then i saw this and my ADD for roguelikes kicked in..So what's TinyKeep? It says it is a roguelike and it is, to an extent. I'm now debating the way to aproach explaining the amount of valid critique i have for the game, for both i find it doing things right and at the same time having some features in it that also spoil some of those said good parts..Let's list all the things that i found valid critigue for:The game has a physics-engine, which to me feels a bit out of place in a roguelike. Although i can somewhat see the reason for it being there, giving more ways of trying to strategize your way through it. But i also found it.. Very annoying. Reason being, that gold usually gets buried under corpses or some of the fallen rubble and trying to get them from under the piles of death and crockery is really frustrating.The Altars and the buffs they give is also something that i found.. Well, broken would be the best term. If you have the gold and just spam the cheapest altar, you can easily get enough buffs to become totally overpowered, which i did mind you. (About 2 dozen[12] buffs.) And with all of those, the game immediately turned from roguelike to Hack&Slash. This might be just a bug or something that the devs will correct at some point, but it really makes the game, (keep in mind, ROGUELIKE.) just way too damned easy.And while i'm on the subject of mechanics, i must voice my disappointment towards the games option-screen. It is pretty non-existant, which cold be argued against with the games simplistic visual-design. However if the game does not have all the options visible on the main menu, (Most of the ""resolution"" and audio-options are only visible when the game has been started.) Will turn people of it. With the obvious quote of ""mobile-port"", which i kind of felt like using, but because i'm a nice guy i wont. It would be nice to set individual levels of detail, the game seems to have just presets and resolution options. Which is very bareboned..Now, for a roguelike. Some people, like me. would welcome the option of saving the game, it seems to be totally absent from the game. It is annoying and kind of selfish from a game to, ask for complete interest for its duration. Even if the game is about 2h in length... Hang on, 2 hours.. Uhm..With that i could also make a note of the price, 13€*. (Currently -34%, about 8,60€)*. It might seem a bit too much for most people, even if it's a roguelike with obvious re-playability value. It is still asking 13€* for, what i can see, only 2-3h of content.And with all that. The game is very easy, if you use the ""ÜberBuff"" tactic. It is just way too simple, which is both its charm and curse at the same time..Geez, this is hard.. I guess, there is an enjoyable roguelike game here to enjoy. However, the problems it has, need some massive correction work. Broken buff-system and the somewhat obnoxious physics with the corpses and the few bugs that i also managed to find during my short playtime. During which i got to the end boss-fight, which killed me instantly. Because my laptop hyperventilated, from all the crazy amount of stuff on screen just before that..Anyway..TinyKeep is a somewhat simplistic, but enjoyable roguelike. It has some features and issues that need repairing, badly.But in its current state, i could recommend it. But not for 13€*, only when its on sale and the issues with it have been fixed.Small edit:It appears there is a hidden level where you can purchase a resurrection power, giving you the ability to respawn infinately.. I have nothing to say against that, besides that it completely breaks the idea of a roguelike..Another small edit:The games price has been lowered form 13€ to 10€."

You get knocked out of attack animations by taking damage, and if you get swarmed by enemies - which happens every now and then - there’s not much you can do beyond take it and die. You can run away, but if you’re surrounded you’re going to be taking a lot of hits regardless. Also you inexplicably run at about half speed when you’re on fire.It’s frustrating in more ways than Rogue-likes usually are. It’s fairly fun to play when the enemies are light and you can plan your routes, leading them onto traps and so on. But when melee combat is a necessity, things take a turn for the worse. You get stuck on objects that litter each room, which you then have to jump over, and you can’t block while jumping, obviously. It’s all just a bit of a hassle which, to be fair, I imagine escaping from a keep would be. That said, I like the style, and could potentially see TinyKeep as a light introduction to the genre but it is hard to recommend to veterans."

Tiny keep works and plays great the whole way around, without a doubt.  The art style is unique, the environments and enemies very cool and well-animated.  I found no major glitches or hang-ups to worry about, and enjoyed the bit of time I put in to this game.That said, I couldn't recommend Tiny Keep.  What game mechanics exist are very polished, but also very limited.  There is almost nothing to keep you engaged in the environment, and that includes the weak-tea story that exists.  Combat becomes very boring.  With most of your runs being pretty short, you'll discover that there is a simple lack of diversity in the content.  Once you know the strategy for each floor, you're just grinding away to get it done.Tiny Keep is a wonderful, well-polished game that could have been much, much more.  Another good one to put on your Wishlist in case a nice discount comes along, but honestly an incomplete game at most prices."

I like to keep things simple sometimes and not having to manage an inventory, or a skill tree, is a refreshing change of pace from games of this type. It almost reminds me a bit of how it felt to play the original Prince Of Persia. You're going to figure out how to fight, you're going to figure out how to avoid traps and you're going to learn to use your surroundings to your advantage when you can. My only real complaint is that the mini-map is crude, blocks your view when used, and just a couple added indicators on it would make navigation a bit easier.PROS:+Easy to pickup and play+Reasonable learning curve+(Mostly) Random level generation+No micro-managing inventory+Achievements are fun additions and realistic to obtain+Controller supportCONS:-Mini Map has very little detail-Mini Map blocks your view when used-Camera setup takes some getting used to"

But in my opinion that's not really a bad thing.A lot of people like playing games that are fast paced and easily accessible. Especially if you only have a few minutes to play between other business. The early floors can be cleared pretty quickly, with the difficulty and time it takes to complete them increasing as you advance.Killing enemies rewards you with coins you can use at altars to gain power-ups for your character, and as far as I can tell getting these is pretty important if you want to survive on higher floors. And surviving is a very good thing, because the game does feature permadeath. So it's casual, with a challenge.Overall I'd say this game is definitely worth a try!"

,Recommended,278620,16301104,"Posted: 10 June, 2015",all,J's,"I have read briefly other reviews and decided nonetheless to purchase the game.  It looked cool and for the price range, I had reasonable expectations.  I was not disapointed.The gameplay is quirky only for the first seconds or minutes, although the very nature of the starting point does not help the first time experience.  It helped me to reduce the look sensitivity (mouse scroling speed) from 5 (1-10) to 4.  Mastering the game is another thing.The game look simple and yet it is not easy.  As pointed out in other reviews, ennemies ganging up on you can leed to your death quickly.  Be especialy cautious of the hordes, i was not and died for it.  I do intend to try again, but some of those achivements will be tough!As for the environement, i would not describe it as buggy.  Yes object are obstacles, but the advantage/disadvantage flows both ways and it's part of it's announced characteristic that it can be used to your advantage. Ennemies have to jump over obstacles the same way you do.  It gives a lot more options then just the basic doorway/bottle-neck tactic, since a lot of object can be moved.  That is without considering the traps or fires that can be used.Some review announced there were little weapons that you could use.  I cannot comment thus far on the number, but in my opinion it would do nicely with the very nature of the game's setting.  You are after escaping from a cell deep in a dungeon and should be thankfull your only weapon is not a shank.  This is not a game about looting, but then again, it's announced feature was being able to use the environnement to your advantage."

The art style issimplistic, with basic options that may or may not appeal to your taste. Thethemes of the individual levels stay mostly the same, but unfortunately the balanceof difficulty is uneven. This can deter newer players or those who enjoy a slow buildupof difficulty as they progress.One difference from level to level can be found in thelayout of the map levels. There are traps on each level, and while not a deterrant,you can use them to your own advantage to trap or kill your enemy. The traps breakafter so much damage has been done to the traps, which I appreciate.The camera angle is a mix of third person and top down; that tied down with thescreen shake of the camera can lead some to become dizzy or nauseousas they progress.The camera angle also can be very disorienting as you try to find your way through thelevels.The gameplay itself is very simplistic; a hack and slash primal kill experience. Ifthat's what you're looking for, it can be good. There is very little in the way of tacticsor combination of gear sets or powerups. The game accomplishes what it sets out to do verywell, but it pushes the difficulty level too fast too soon, combined with the seasick feeling of the camera angle makes me hesitantly recommend it.

Makes for a solid piece of entertainment, and with the recent 75% sales you can't go wrong.The first 5 levels are all training, then it becomes a bit more entertaining.

,Not Recommended,278620,12367395,"Posted: 4 October, 2014",all,Zweifach,"TinyKeep is definitely a game with a lot of promise and it has some really cool features, but ultimately it falls short of being anything more than just a distraction for a couple of hours. Let's start with what turned out good.The gameplay is fast and frantic, yet simple, giving it a very adrenaline filled arcade type feel. The art style is both audibly and visually charming even if the characters faces are a bit dead and lifeless. Every, chair, table, crate, cup, and bone in the game has full physics to it, which makes the environment feel messy and alive.So where does TinyKeep fall flat? Lets start with the big pink elephant in the room, Permadeath. When done right it can make a game feel challenging and suspenseful. When done wrong it can make it frustrating and repetitive. Tinykeep falls into the latter category.The gameplay is simple hack n' slash with no room for differing play-styles or player choice. The dungeon layouts are random but the content of each floor has little to no variation. These issues wouldn't matter for most games except your expected to play through the same levels over and over and over again every time you die.Other games featuring permadeath offer enough variation to keep each playthrough different. The player will have a chance to try a different strategy or approach, and they may discover new enemies, items, traps, and environments that they didn't see last time. TinyKeep offers very little in this regard.Short of that, my other complaints are merely nitpicks. Sometimes the camera angle and the clutter on the dungeon floor can make movement cumbersome and unnecessarily difficult. The map is hard to read, which is a real pain considering the layout is random. Traps are sometimes  hard to avoid, yet they do little damage, so oftentimes you will find yourself just running through them without care if they hit you or not. I could go on, but I'm sure the problems will be smoothed out with later patches."

Music and sound is good, and the voice acting by whoever voices Maggie is pretty damn solid.  Not many item pick ups.  I have only found 1 weapon and 1 shield, but granted I have only gotten to the 3rd floor.  I think it is going for an The Binding of Isaac feel, but with fancier visuals and more melee focus combat.  The combat seems a bit repetitive, however, that maybe because I suck at using traps and monsters against eachother.

For those unfamiliar with the game, it follows the hero's attempt to escape the dungeon, starting with absolultely no offensive or defensive abilities, apart from the fleetness of your feet. True, avoiding the dungeon's denizons at first is essential, but once armed, it becomes a joyful physics  heavy journey of destruction to freedom.

A little bit of luck will grant you the right buffs however, then you can relax and enjoy the ensuing carnage.Punctuating the journey at various points are events which offer a  humorous welcome  break from the endless death and skeleton macaroni soup that you are helping to create. The easter eggs offer truly LOL moments, and you can see the care with which the developers have exercised in crafting a thoroughly entertaining experience.It certainly will take you a while to work out the best system for assaulting the dungeon, and you really need to overcome the initial feeling of hopelessness, but it resolves into such a clever game that really needs to be completed.

You are a prisoner, escaping the dungeon. The first few minutes are a mad dash as you race around trying to find a sword and shield while chased by guards. You cant hurt them, so better run. The game graphics are cartoony polygons, which is unique as most roguelikes use pixels or tiles. The game is top down, and is not grid based so you have complete freedom of movement. And you're going to need it, as you sprint past traps and jump obstacles. The full (except in game menu) and customizable controller support is fluid, LS moves, RS spins the camera and your character. Every button press is customizable. Thats a breath of fresh air for someone like me with limited use of a hand.My only complaint about the controls is I wish there was a way to ""flip around"" with say a RS double tap, or clicking RS. It sucks when a guy comes up behind you and you get hit in the back cuz you couldnt turn fast enough to block.Its pretty fun to block with your shielld while slashing away.

It is a funny little game, as your cellmate leaves you behind, planting notes as she goes and you read them in her scottish voice and accent. A little annoying when it comes to getting stuck on everything (Personally, I think they should have removed the trees).

When you swing your weapon to attack but realized you should have maybe blocked, it's very forgiving in letting you cancel the attack to perform that block action.The only real con I think worth noting is the lack of character animations in general. You have run and sprint. I feel like for a game that relies on it's physics and environment, having the appropriate animations for walking, turning and straffing could add a lot more immersion to the experience.that and it sometime's feels congested trying to navigate the cooridors and dungeons.People complain about the lack of depth, but I think it's more designed to be a quick pick up and play sort of game. I don't want to have to manage inventory and loot, there are enough games like that. This game takes a more arcade approach to the dungeon crawling experience and that's fine by me.The game feels like a real lite, simplified 'Gauntlet Legends' experience, but it really isn't anything like that.All in all, I like the game, I like the simplicitiy of it and I see a lot of potential to improve upon what the developer aimed for in the playing experience."

And it largely does a good job of this. It's actaully a good intro game into many of these genre's, as it simplifies many of their elements into sometghing almost casual. I say 'almost', as the difficulty puts this game out of reach of a Casual gamer.  This game is going to kill you and send you back to the start. a lot.Death is a thing. Perma death, level 1. no progression.MechanicsDungeon generation is similar to another game, Spelunky - that is, each level is made according to a formula, so you'll see the same obsticals and content each time on any given level, only the order of the rooms may shange.Items in the world are also obsticles - knock a vase over now and you'll have to jump over it later. this will get you killed more than once.enemies can swarm you, and you pretty well cannot escape once this happens.RPG elements are randomised, so that there is no overthinking about what skills to unlock, it just gives you skills, and you have to adapt your gameplay style on the fly. one run you might get a few speed buffs, the next, might be defensive buffs... etc.GraphicsTiny keep, Big heads. It's a cutesy art style, seems to suit the game well, and is beautifully drawn.Will run on even a modest computer.There is blood spatter, despite the cutesy - it's not gory, but it is there.Controlsstandard FPS controls for kb/mouse.

The game is simple, so the controls are too. they work well, feel responsive, but you can pick up on the controller thing, as the camera can float a little (isn't) directly connected to the mouse like an FPS)AudioWasn't working for me, sadly. I'll update this later.Interesting stuffThere's no Wiki - So how do you look up whether the big bone guy that 1hits you can be killed? Do the Skellies ever stop spawning>?

While that sentence makes this sound  like a must buy, it has some issues preventing it from reaching it's full potential.1: The phyiscs objects keeps getting in the way, and at some point the massive piles of bodies just make it a sludge getting through rooms. I had to walk to the farthest corner to despawn the ragdolls during one level, because the corpses was lagging my game to a crawl. Floor traps sometimes break and fall off, i'm not certain if that is a bug or a feature.2: The maps are confusing, and the lack of locked rotation meant i got lost at many points. The map screens paint function makes reading the map quite difficult. The 3D enviorments sometimes gets in the way of seeing the character and the monsters he is fighting.3: The game is structured like a rougelike, with random level generation, random monster placement, and semi random powerups. However, the structure of the game dosen't really support this: There is nothing to do on a second run. All rooms are functionally identical, either containing traps, enemies or not. There are no special rooms, or random powerups to find, and very little reward for exploring but more enemies that might yield gold. You pay for the powerups using coins, but these are plain, and unintresting. Faster movement when your holding a shield, running backwards faster, jumping higher, increased damage towards certain types of enemies. Nothing that will change the way you do your run, and most runs you will simply have most powerups at the end anyway.But having it a rougelike means no save function, which means that if you die you have to start over. Which is fine, except 90% of the game is very very easy! There is really no problem defeating the first three ""bosses"", they are no harder then regular enemies. The last boss however, can basically kill you in a 2-3 hits, especially when your acid sword hits you both, making you slow and draining your health. If you die then, you have to play through 90% of the content.Which i just did.""Fun.""You could also jump ahead at try to defeat him with the starting sword and none of your powerups. Which kinda defeats the point of the rougelike anyway. Why not just have a save system?Still, worth the 3 euros, fun if flawed little experience."

Most of the time I am left with a sense of wanting or feel like the game doesn't have enough to it to make me want to play it more, But TinyKeep is one that I plan to play for quite a while.It's biggest advantage is it procedurally generated environments, which I feel most in not all Roguelikes need. While each level of the dungeon has the same ultimate goal, the traps, rooms and enemies are always different. One playthrough might have you dealing with more archers, while hte next could have you dealing with more barabrians. And that's just the tip of the iceburg!The game boasts a unique leveling system, or at least unique in the sense that you don't really gain XP. instead, certain enemies and environment items from coins which you can exchange for enhancements to your character at specific alters placed in the map. There's always one at the end of hte dungeon, so you can save up until you get to it, or you can find the secondary one hidden somewhere. The second one costs much more in coin, but usually gives much better buffs because of it.It's not extrememly challenging when you're faced with only a few opponents, but soon more traps nad enemies appear, giving you less room to run, and that's when it gets tense and fun.

,Not Recommended,278620,15175773,"Posted: 2 April, 2015",all,Jade.Wu,"TinyKeep is not at all a Roguelike game despite what the developers and others might try to convince you, in reality TinyKeep is a straightfoward action game with RNG elements. That's it.So let me explain by TinyKeep not qualifying as a roguelike game, it only has procedural generation and permanent death that can even barely and I mean barely qualify itself as a roguelike. The reason for this is simple: Permanent Death can be removed from the game once a certain item is obtained which removes a huge staple of the roguelike genre. Secondly procedural generation means jack in this game. Yes the dungeons are 'randomized' but if they always consist of the same things for each level, in my opinion it should not count as procedural generation.Now let me explain why it should not count as Procedural Level Generation. In the Binding of Isaac as a popular example, each floor has a semi-random amount of rooms with random enemies, a random boss, a treasure room with a random item, and two secret rooms for the bare minimum. The only floors that stay somewhat consistent are the last two floors along with the floor for Mom's Heart.In TinyKeep the first level will always involveFloor 1 - Prison, find Sword/Shield, only Archers/Brawlers with 1 Treasure ChestFloor 2 - Prison, Boss at the end once you reach the door note with 1 treasure chest and 1 throneFloor 3 - Prison unlock the 3 colored doors, unleash the skeletons, go to door and beat the big skeletonFloor 4 - Dodge stone guy and hit the end everyone is orcsFloor 5 - Orcs with 2 stone guys, 3 colored doors, unleash skeletonsFloor 6 - Skeleton Boss, super short with nothing in itFloor 7 - Flames n demons have to have fire proof perkFloor 8 - Flames n demons w/bossSeriously I can go on. Every floor is the same. I can't qualify this game for being Procedurally generated if every floor has the exact same qualities barely moved around. TinyKeep also has a whopping total of 6 enemy types (I'm not counting the fact that there's a goblin/skeleton/human archer as three different types, let's face it they're all reskinned versions of the same thing). And you know what floors you face which.I don't believe only having a floor layout randomizer should ever qualify as a roguelike, which is all that TinyKeep has.At any rate the game suffers from far more than the two elements I listed above. The only 'power up' of sorts in the game involves buying blessings for either 15g, 7 - 100g, 1 - 500g, and 2 - 750g. (The latter two are endgame).The 15g blessings can be bought up to at least 15 times in a row, at a complete RNG chance as to which of many skills it can give you will power up. The 100g blessings can only be bought one time each and are easily the most needed blessings that every player needs, and the last three (500g/750g) are for secret/broken powers.Here's the problem with these blessings. Most of them are worthless at the 15g level,-There is one for running faster which has diminishing returns because you only need to move so fast-Multistrike which is worthless past level 2-3-Serrated Edge which is an RNG chance of doing more damage-Arrows to Ether which is an RNG chance to dodge an arrow-Able to run backwards faster-Run with a shield fasterOut of all of these the only TWO skills that aren't complete garbage are the Tank skill and the Lightning Reflexes skill. None of the other skills are even worth leveling up but since it's RNG it'll probably happen if you want it or not.Also RNG only exists to screw you over in this game.-Chests can be empty for no reason-No vase spawns in a level-RNG for any of the 15g blessingsAnother problem with the game is the inclusion of a physics system of sorts, where walls will blow out throwing blocks on the floor, and enemies bodies will become obstacles when you kill them. It just gets frustrating especially in the latter levels of the game with the amount of clutter everywhere. Especially when the giant skeleton bodies seem to never go away getting me stuck numerous times.Finally one of the last problems is that 'farming' exists which essentially completely breaks the game. Essentially levels 1-4 are the scariest part of the game because it's so hard to get your hands on money, at that point in the game it's possible to only have around 300 coins. Once you hit level 5 you can get every single 100g power up and level up most of the 15g ones to 10 with ease. This is because the skeleton invasion never ends and you can infinitely farm them for however long you please.Overall the game acts like I'm having more fun than anyone could ever possibly have. It's really not fun to play through this game more than a single time and the game expects you to play through multiple times. The game is downright confusing with some of the 'secrets' such as the cauldron which is completely ignored until the loop begins. This makes no sense because there is another shrine which was kept out of the early levels to not confuse beginning players. Why this was included is beyond the scope of my knowledge.If this game had done the blessings differently I might not have such a problem with it, perhaps make them like Isaac to where they are powerups you can find throughout the level. Maybe even make it to where you could CHOOSE which one you wanted instead of rolling the dice each time.The game should also stop being so persnickity about secrets. It's cute that you want to include secrets, and I think most games should do more of them BUT it's stupid that the second half of the game is locked behind a 'secret' of sorts and I know most people who have reviewed the game probably don't even realize it exists.The bigger problem with that is that the second-half of the game is complete garbage. Again too much clutter and♥♥♥♥♥♥flying around everywhere making progress a chore. Furthermore it's even sillier that if you make it to the 2nd half of the game and die, you are forced to replay through the first half just to get back to the second half.Secrets can be done reasonably without being such an annoyance. The demon secret in this game for example was a good choice. The acid cauldron on the other hand was a very poor choice.All in all for 3$ on sale it ISN'T THAT BAD of a purchase. I just can't find any redeeming qualities to this game that feels like I could have played for free online. You will only get a few hours of playtime max (between 2-6 hours), and you'll probably not even want to finish out the game because of how frustratingly annoying it is."

This one is very important to me since I like games in which the character faces very bad odds. This gives me a little adrenaline rush. The way enemies attack manages to give variety because they vary in size. A number of them could have spawned in one place which forces you to run away.-Cool traps. I think the traps I've seen so far are pretty cool because they are not only a danger to you but you can lead the pursuing enemies into those areas.-Random reactions from people you rescue. They might decide to help you. They could be useful. They could be weak and get killed right away. Some will run away and not help you. Then there are some who'll actually attack you. This makes freeing other prisoners a gamble, which I like.-limited gold and treasure. I like how you are not able to simply farm same areas and collect infinite amount of gold to eventually buy anything you want. At least at the beginning the gold is not common enough to allow you to buy something really fancy. Add to that the fact that you won't always be able to access a seller, so that causes to make decisions that will often decide when your character dies.-nice cute graphics. I like that the graphics run well on my crappy computer. The design of the dungeons and enemies along with sound makes them all kind of entertaining. I am not as happy about limited options you get to design your own characters.Cons:it is important to point out some annoyances and glitches I've seen as well.-While exploring the different maps that were generated each time I've seen areas where one unbreakable and unpassable object blocks pathways of the doors. Not happening very often but when it does I have to restart.-AI is pretty weak. Enemies often rush after you despite being near death, or go into the trap without any pause. They often do it in a straight line, which looks very distracting.-Too few options for character appearance. Would be nice to give them more body options.-When you encounter the store you might have just a few coins short of some expensive item. Unfortunately the stores usually do not have alternative ways to spend money on cheaper support items like potions, arrows, bad weapons. etc.Overall I really enjoy the game despite lack of polish or the annoyances. It could be much better if more updates came out."

This makes it especially aggravating to kite around traps or dodge enemies. The map should have been integrated into the main UI instead of being a seperate screen, and the map details are drawn like a 3 year old sketched it. Some bosses (perhaps because of the random layouts of the dungeons) come out of nowhere and give you no where to kite or traps nearby to utilitze. You just get rushed and die. And sometimes you see the boss coming from afar and have ample time to plan a strategy to take him out.The game doesn't always allow player skill to factor into your success at escaping.

Granted, *it has potential* to be very fun, but currently it does not meet standards.  Though this game has a nice concept, the absent replayablity, simplistic elements, and awkward design break this game's worth.First and foremost, this game doesn't have much replayability.  Granted, it's worth stating that no level is the same (other than the elements (different enemies, objectives)).  The layout is different every time, which is cool.  And I understand the rogue-like design of a hard-restart upon death (I love FTL).  But there is a huge difference in difficult and tedious.  You CAN skip a level once you beat it (e.g. go to 6/20); but if you do, you WILL lose.  This is because once you die, you lose any perks.  Later on, you can't really win without having a lot of those vital perks.  Having to go through levels 1-5 the first three times is okay.  But those get boring, FAST.  The gameplay is not exciting enough to get me through it each time.  The developer should at least allow a checkbox that let's the player keep perks upon death.  This would at least give me incentive to come back.--Honestly, I cannot see myself coming back after one or two more plays.I love the idea of a dungeon crawler that forces the player to use speed, cunning, and logic.   This game has some of those elements, but they are repeated and way too simple.  Hack, hack, block, hack.  Run away behind the enterance; wait for archer; kill archer.  That's the game.This is an indie game.  Bugs are too be expected; I get that.  But in a rogue game, where death means another 20 minutes wasted, it isn't easy to forgive.  Getting stuck on a random pointless vase or stone and getting swarmed is so disappointing.  I'm used to being disappointed in myself; don't make me have to change my thinking.Overall, it's a nice idea, but I can't really say I enjoyed it.  I kept waiting for it to improve and give me more, but instead it only got repetive.5/10"

It has a cool art style, its gameplay is quick and full of action, and the controls are snappy. When I first started playing, I honestly thought I loved the game! Then, after awhile, I beat a couple levels, and realized I was SO BORED.TinyKeep is a ""rogue-like"" in that you have to make muliple runs through the dungeon/prison you are escaping, learning enemy types and traps, and honing skills that you will need to complete the game. The problem is, there isn't enough of those things for you to stay interested in playing and there aren't ANY permanent elements that carry over between plays (until you beat the game)!Enemies/TrapsThere are only something like 10 enemies in the entire game, and a few of them play identically to each other. That being said, it gets worse because only a couple of those 10 enemies are actually any threat past your first play through! After only a few hours, you will easily defeat or avoid all enemies and really the only reason you might die is if you are trying to grab some tricky loot. The traps are exactly the same: ~10 different types, a few are nearly identical, and only 1-2 actually pose a threat.Upgrades/ItemsThere are NO items past the sword and shield you get in the beginning (I am NOT counting items you get after you beat the game). The main way you defend yourself is by buying abilities/buffs at shrines with gold you have collected. There are different level shrines and about 20 different buffs. The problem here is threefold: 1. the abilities/buffs do not improve the gameplay in any significant way, 2. the buffs are completey random, and 3. the buffs are not permanent through multiple play throughs. Problem number one is the biggest. A couple buffs give you special abilities, but overall, you will be playing this game exactly the same way in level 20 as you were in level 2. Most of the upgrades just beef up your character so you can take damage from enemies. Problem number 2 is very annoying, because buffs cost money and they are completely random, I have spent 300 coins to get the same one THREE times! Granted, some buffs stack, but the game should prioritize new upgrades with a higher probability when purchasing. Finally, problem 3 is actually no that big of a deal, since you can become OP by level 5 (out of 20) and never have a problem for the rest of the game.What TinyKeep boils down to is grind. For the first few hours you will have genuine fun as you figure out the gameplay mechanics and storyline, but after that its the same experience over an over: attack monster, bait monster into trap, avoid easy trap, collect coins, buy repetitive upgrades, rinse, repeat...Get it on sale..."

Chaotic fun and challenging, I like to think of this as dark souls for people who just want a shourt burst of dungeoneering without all of the investment."

It was great when they included the ability to save the game at any level you are playing on however you will lose all the progress achieved so far for that level ... BUT should your game crash you can kiss the entire run good bye because when I reload I find my save spot gone and have to start all over again.  Not very impressed especially when you spend extra time being very careful and collecting every possible piece of gold you can find.I die and have to restart enough as it is but should I actually stay alive my chances of a random crash keep increasing, which is ok if you just had to reload and restart that level.  But no it takes your whole game with it meaning I'm probably not going to play this game anymore unless they can fix the way the save mechanic works so you don't lose everything in the unfortunate incident of a crash."

The graphics are quite nice, the controls are good enough for me, except the fact that you access the map with the tab key and sometimes when you are running with shift you accidentaly open the ""steam menu thingy"" and it ruins your chances of surviving. The music is also fitting to the environment and the action levels. I recommend buying the game if it is on sale like I did, but if you watch the trailer and you don't find it entertaining then don't buy it even then, because what you see there is all there is to this game. If you do buy it, good luck escaping friends!"

You will have to find a sword and a shield. You will have to defend yourself from enemies by using your weapons or traps around the dungeon. You can free other prisoners but they can either attack you or join you. You will find gold which you can pick up and use for an altar. The altar provides you with a random effect which could change your gameplay.Meh Replayability.Stale gameplay.Some character progession.Pretty Repetitive and you have seen the game within 10 minutes.Traps around the dungeon.Okay Controls.Okay music.Okay Graphics.There are ingame options.There are ""Show controls""Enragd Prisoner will attack Enemies.You have a minimap.Random generated Dungeons.There is a global volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a mouse sensitivity slidebar available.Other things.Is Roguelike-ish.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10"
