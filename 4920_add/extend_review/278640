It's fun! You scoot and dash around as a little robot, shoot and blast your way through enemies (you even get a user guided homing missile) and even fly around with a jetback.One level I found the jetpack and just start flying non-stop up in the air... going and going... and I found coins! (or whatever they are) xD. Now I'm exploring everything. :D And the controls are awesome with the 360 controller.The 16 Bit style characters, backgrounds and details look great and the 16-Bit chiptune music is awesome. It's not repetitive and mixes up really well.If you like playing old school retro style shoot-em up platform games like back in the days of Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-16, then you should get this game.For the price it costs, it is more than worth it. :D"

Colors are mishmashed and thrown together (why are background objects as bright as foreground ones), the environments have WAY too much clutter, sometimes it's hard to tell what is a platform or ground from the background, and at too many times there is foreground foliage that blocks too much of your view (If this is unintentional it's an amateur mistake, if it's intentional it is neither fun nor challenging). The cutscenes look awful as well.The controls are sometimes awkward and ANY area involving pushing moveable crates onto water is a headache. Why doesn't the robot simply move along with the crate? Why do I need to manually move him along with it? Again, this isn't fun and it's a terribly cheap challenge. There is a level in stage two where you need to do this for an extended amount of time without any checkpoints and it is unbelieveably frustrating (I have actually quit the game since this area and do not intend to come back).Apparently no one tested the levels for collision either as far too many levels with the jetpack allow to move behind walls or enviromental objects you're not supposed to, some of which trap you or kill you or all around mislead you.It doesn't help that certain enemies come in different sizes and are not easily destroyed by your guns. This is most noticeable in the spider boss level where you simply cannot shoot the green enemies blocking your path because they're at an awkward height. This would have been easily fixed simply by not having the grenade attack hurt you ala Metroid. And while you have multiple weapons at your disposal almost none of them are very useful outside of the grenade.And speaking of the spider boss, why is the boss level in the MIDDLE of the world? Why did the world just end a couple levels later when I went down a random sewer pipe? The pacing is just bizarre.I wanted to like the game, and I realize it's probably a first attempt at making a game, but this is just too unfinished and poorly thought out for me to enjoy. This could have easily used more time in the kitchen, first attempt or not."
,Not Recommended,278640,13086572,"Posted: 25 November, 2014",all,Dangerous Beans,"This is a pretty straightforward platformer with nothing really innovative going on. Controls are tight and responsive, but the dash is too easy to trigger when trying to make precise corrections, and the game sort of forces you into that kind of situation from time to time. In some places distinguishing between background and foreground tiles is impossible and you end up face-planting into a wall, which is frustrating.Overall the game isn't really shaky, but it's still far from solid. I feel like someone decided to make a platformer, then at the 80% mark they said, ""Ah, that's good enough.""It's not bad or anything, there's just nothing to recommend it when there's plenty of more polished platformers competing against it. If you're really hard up for a platformer then you may like it, otherwise you're probably better off looking for something else."

There are barriers spanning half the height of the corridor at regular intervals, alternately protruding from the floor or ceiling. You must traverse this corridor fast enough to keep up with the NPC you are pursuing, but not so fast that you go off-camera (the camera is locked to the NPC rather than you).""I cannot recommend it, but if you don't mind that sort of thing, I dare say it's a good example of the style."

I love the videos on the game's store page. It's like I'm back in the early 90s again. But I can't give a very in-depth review since I haven't played long but thought I'd give a small criticism since it's still fresh in my mind. One issue with this game and some retro-ish games is that the distinciton between passive/background elements and active/foreground elements isn't always very distinguished so sometimes when playing, as a new player, I don't always know what blocks or objects I can interact with and what I can't. But other than that, unless I edit this review later, I recommend this game if you're looking for a simple, fun, retro-style game and have a few bucks to spare."
76561197983662248,Not Recommended,278640,14652858,"Posted: 25 February, 2015",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: There used to be a much longer header to these reviews, but for the sake of brevity I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: The comparison has often been made in the past between this game and Commander Keen + some Genesis/Mega Drive-y stuff. As far as the level design goes, that isn't too far off base, although fortunately for most people this game controls loads better than the Commander Keen games ever did. This game's control scheme is pretty alright, even though I do have a few complaints. Movement is handled (and this will be written with respect to the 360 controller, as playing a platformer with a keyboard just isn't a good idea) with either the analog stick or the D-pad. Double tapping left or right will make you dash, which is one of my complaints. I would've much prefered a dash button as opposed to the double tap option, as I usually tap my directions a lot whenever I try to adjust my landing. Jumping is with A, shooting is with X... pretty standard stuff.As far as the level design goes, the first three levels are pretty much exactly the same: go destroy the thing, get keycards, shoot enemies, exit level, rinse, lather, repeat. The fourht level inexplicably changes things up, playing more like a traditional Megaman-inspired game. Beyond that... well, I didn't get further than stage four. Why? There was a puzzle room in which you have to maneuver two blocks around a small room to hold down a switch. These blocks are insanely glitchy. I broke that room eight different ways, all while still having not found the ""proper"" solution to the room. The blocks would sometimes fuse together, rendering them unpushable; sometimes fuse with the ceiling, land on top of you... sometimes they'll just not even bother with colission detection whatsoever.That's not really a good reason to not recommend the game, though. Why do I not recommend this game, then? It's not so much one huge terrible thing; it's more of a death by 1,000 papercuts, to where I was just looking for an excuse to not play it. For example, moving platforms do not have friction with your sprite, meaning that you've gotta tap a lot in order to stay on that platform (which can also lead to you dashing off said platform and into an arbitrary  one-hit kill zone). One section of a level completely obscures the platform, leaving you to just guess whether or not you're still on the platform. Another section with these platforms has you inexplicably changing direction every time you drop to another waterway, leading to some cheap deaths. There's also another section in which platforms are sent out to you entirely on RNG, which can lead to you just kinda dying sometimes. Then there's the boss of area one that runs, launches bombs and knocks things down on you, only to stand still and just kinda die at the end of the level for no reason.I could probably go on for at least another few paragraphs, but suffice to say I don't think I'll be coming back to this one. Even barring those problems, this game didn't really have enough there in the first place to interest me. It's not a bad game to give to a kid who doesn't really care what they play, and they'll almost certainly get their $5 out of it. As for someone who thinks in terms of game design, this game probably won't be for you. 4/10.Story: The store page says that this game is story driven. Well, I suppose it kinda is, but it's not really too big of a deal. Of course, since I never finished the game, assigning a point value to the story would be silly, so I'm just not gonna do that.Graphics: Well, the graphics aren't bad. In fact, this is where I dare say a lot of the effort in the game went to. For the first three levels the pixel art is pretty rad, although it does drop off a bit in terms of quality around level four. Again, beyond that I can't really say much more. One thing I can say, however, is that this game seems to like adding motion blur every now and then (or as I call it, Cataract Vision). There's no way to turn it off, and if you've got motion sickness, I could see this being a bit of an issue for you. Regarding the technical side of the graphics, it of course runs at a perfect 60FPS, and it launches at a resolution which is around 1280x720, to then fullscreen to your native resolution. There didn't seem to be any resolution options other than fullscreen or not-fullscreen, so take that as you will. Given that I try to play games fullscreen at my resolution as often as possible, it wasn't too big of a deal for me. The game performs well enough (as one would expect) and the pixel art is quite good; I just wish there was a way to turn off Cataract Vision. 3/5.Sound: This is where the Genesis/Mega Drive comparison really comes into play. While it isn't exclusively using the Genesis/MD sound chip, it does borrow some samples such as the bass. Either way, if you're familiar with the Genesis/MD soundchip and enjoy it, you'll enjoy it. I'm impartial to the sound chip, so I didn't really feel that strongly about it. As for the compositions themselves, they're alright in the context of the stages, but it's not something I'd listen to particularly often outside of the game. Also, I do wish they had more than one song for stage four, as the stage doesn't have any level transitions, meaning that you get to hear the same song looping for about 30-40 minutes. As for the sound effects... it's a retro inspired game; what do you expect? I will say that the sound effects do have a tendency to stack and get a bit loud, which can be a bit annoying at times, although it happens pretty rarely, so it's not the biggest deal. Overall on the sound front, it's about average for an indie retro inspired platformer. People who go coocoo for chiptunes may find a lot to love here, but as for me, it's just kinda okay. 2/5.Overall scores are: 4/0/3/2; cumulative score of 4.5/10. It's biggest problems for me are its smaller problems and that even without said problems, there's not much else going on here. Again, if you want to get it for a kid or something, they'll probably be alright with it for a bit, but if you know some things about game design, this game isn't really gonna interest you."

Some of the puzzles challenge you to explore the levels, which is nice. However, some the levels have weird design that make it difficult to figure out how to reach items or goals. Some levels demand precise control that frustrates without an good/accurate controller.I would have been on the fence about recommending this, but then the bugs happened. A bug corrupted my save and after the bug was fixed (?) my save file was wiped out. Gear collection was resetting every time you closed the game. Developers sometimes did answer questions about these issues on the forum, but didn't end up responding to support emails.Data loss is an instant turn off, and it just didn't seem worth it to start the game over again."

Graphically, the game does draw influence from blue robot games of greater repute, however, the similarities, more or less, end there.KR-17 suffers from an overall lack of polish. Graphics I often found were stretch and scaled and sometimes it was difficult to tell which was foreground and which was background. The difficulty of the challenges seem to follow no particular pattern and much of the gameplay feels a bit like filler. The bosses I found to be incredibly weak and more than half of them involved running through a gauntlet of hazards while the boss destroys the level. The music, rather than employing catch chiptunes, assaults us with MIDI-esque synthesized music. Because of the overall lack of polish, rather than feeling like a classic, it feels like a bit like a b-list side-scroller downloaded from a BBS circa 1993. This game needs at least another 6 months in the oven before it's fully baked.The game looks better than it actually is, however if you're a vintage gamer and in the mood for this sort of gameplay, dispite it's many flaws, it does offer some respectible challenges.

Sometimes, though, you just have to wonder if going retro was the best choice.With Terrian Saga: KR-17, there doesn't seem to be any real defining feature. This is a game based on the likes of MegaMan or old Apogee MS-DOS titles. It's an action platformer with a greater emphasis on platforming. These levels will require you to search for keys to progress; just like the good-old-days.Still, there really isn't much to it. You find keys, shoot enemies and progress. The game routinely stops to give you frustratingly difficult boss battles, but even those end up being too short. The game breezes by without much of a care.I suppose that could be noted as a plus, but I never felt invested in this game. The sprite work is fantastic, but the art style puts me off. It looks like a 5 year old's drawings of a ""cool"" robot he saw. This is almost like if Wall-E got fed up with cleaning the Earth.The choice of weapons is almost entirely moot, too. While you have access to a bomb, a remote bomb, a claymore and flamethrower, you really only ever need the bomb. It has the most use, deals the most damage and can be lobbed a great distance. Nothing else really matters, apart from a failed attempt at diversity.Your core blaster even works quite well against every enemy. One foe requires you to dodge when shooting it, but you could take advantage of the invincibility frames and mutilate him. Nearly all the adversaries are the same, too. Just shoot, shoot and shoot some more.Do I really find the game that unenjoyable? No, honestly. The music is excellent and the level design, itself, is solid. I love old-school style games that require you to remember routes and plan out a perfect path. KR-17 has that in spades. I just wish they lasted longer.I would also like it if the game would play by it's own rules. In most levels, you have access to a dash ability. Sometimes, within the same section of levels, you lose that ability. You also get a jetpack that carries over into some levels, but not all of them. It becomes confusing and infuriating when you go to dash and then fall into an acid pit.I also have to take points off for the lame final boss and horrendous cliff-hanger ending. I'm not certain that a sequel will be inevitable, but to end your first title on what basically is a ""To Be Continued"" screen is just mean.Still, for $5, you could do worse. Honestly, I'd just check out some of the other retro style platformers on Steam. This one doesn't do much that would differentiate it from the pack.6/10"

I found a forum post showing an animated gif of someone making the jumps, and with that, it ""only"" took me another 10 tries or so to get through the section.  Did I mention this was on ""easy""?  Honestly, I don't want games to be super-easy, challenging is fine.  But there's challenging and there's nigh-on impossible.  And you shouldn't run into the latter on ""easy"" mode."

You have your main blaster attack, a selection of items such as grenades, mines and a cruise missile. Occasionally you are given a jet pack so that you just fly around instead jumping.I spent the first 5 minutes or so trying to figure out the controls. I got stuck at the very beginning because I didn't know what the jump button was or how to activate objects. I had go back to the main menu a couple of times and on returning to the game you cannot skip dialogue so it was a bit tedious. Also not all the controls are listed in the menu and I found that tutorial tips are easily missed or not clear. Anyway I eventually figured it out lol. Things turned to not be too bad. You really need to look where you are going to avoid hazards in this game, some are insta-death. I frequently died and had to start from the last checkpoint. But thankfully they are generously dispersed around each map. Controlling your cruise missile is basically like playing snake. It moves quite fast and easily clips into objects and explodes prematurely. The game has lot's typical platforming type of stuff e.g. jumping from one platform to another and avoiding dangers. I preferred using the jetpack to just fly most the time over jumping.While the game is not really bad. I didn't feel that it was special and I don't really have any urge to play it more than I did. I didn't really feel engaged in the story and the game tends to have characteristics which are potentially annoying that you typically get with old side-scrollers. I would only recommend it to those with a passion for these kinds of retro 2D side-scrollers.Clickherefor more let’s play videos =)"

,Recommended,278640,17040853,"Posted: 14 July, 2015",all,*+*+TheLizardKing+*+*,"It's a platformer. Nothing you haven't seen before, nothing you won't see again. You play a small robot (with some story, but I admittedly skipped through to play the game) who has a warhead for a buddy. He gives you exposition, and tips as to how to move around in the world. Platforms, elevators, guns, bombs, grenades... Lots of stuff to go boom.PROS:If you like platformers, this is well worth it for the price. I think I paid around 42 cents, and that's always worth a game to me. The level designs are interesting and harken back to the golden age of 8 bit things jumping onto 8 bit things. The music is 8 bit as well, and pretty good (although gets a tad repetitive, and feels a bit like I'm stuck in a Pokemon battle). The weapons are interesting, as your three weapons do three different things. Controlling your missile buddy is a game in itself, having to manuever him through quick turns at fast speeds through maze-like structures. It feels rewarding, too, if at times too easy.CONS:Even without skipping the intro, I don't think there's enough telling you what you can and cannot step on. Maybe it's a little obvious, and I a little too drunk, but there seem to be several areas where you learned where NOT to jump only after jumping. Sure, the save points are frequent enough, and the gameplay itself easy enough, but still... a little direction goes a long way. The music is a bit much, especially if you're just stuck on a part and it's there thumpin' along in the background, but it's pleasant initially.Should you get it? If you like platformers and 42 cent indie games, yeah it's worth it. I got about a half hour out of it, and I'll most likely come back to it. I consider that worth the money I paid for it, and it's not a bad little platformer."

When people complain about the barrells in an early level being difficult to stand on, they didn't warn me of the crazy parts where you have to fly through thin lanes of single hit death areas. Or the part where you have fight to struggle to stay on a moving platform while simultaneously fighting enemies and avoiding some more single hit deaths.Aside from that the game plays well and looks great with a fun little story on the side. I enjoyed my time with it but in the end the frustrating parts are simply not fun any more. Too bad as there seemed quiet a bit more to see..."
