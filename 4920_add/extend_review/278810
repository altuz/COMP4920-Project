It's how I got tricked into buying it.This got very boring within (EDIT: apparantly, only 0.9 ) hours. I gave it two play sessions. Didn't realize how short they were because I just wasn't having a good enough time. You never need to use the buddy cop system, as your AI controlled partner is unreliable and often just gets gunned down. Beating missions gives you xp you can use to level up any cop you want, and you can just max out all skills on whichever one you choose. So, there's no real reason to ever choose any other cops once you've picked two. Also, the levels are all samey. You kill waves of enemies (or arrest them as they come around corners) until you get to a checkpoint. Rinse, repeat. It's not as fun as Hotline Miami, which several positive reviews have compared it to. Save your money and look at getting something else.Also, there isn't really any storyline. If you're going to get this game, wait for it to go on a huge sale (like 75% off)."

Thugs get harder to kill and have better aim at later levels and this removes the strategy aspect of the game. The game has no real AI all of the thugs just run at you and try to shoot at some distance depending on how hard the level should be. The ""story"" is uninteresting and not engaging at all. You have to grind levels and doing the first mission a thousand times is the best way to do it, which is boring as hell. If you like grinding and grinding just to keep playing a game then this is the perfect game for you, but I regret buying it because it gets repetitive really fast.Since I agree with almost everything TotalBiscuit says in this video, here's a link to it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hY-BorzPoM"

I only switched to the other cop to save time running across the level to clear other rooms of the building, because sometimes the A.I. in the room I wanted to clear weren't walking in circles close enough to a door or a corner.Because I was guaranteed to lose any firefight with more than 2 bad guys, the only way I could pass missions was to hide around corners and wait for the enemy to walk infront of me or a door and then arrest them instantly with a melee attack. Pushing a door into an enemy causes them to fall over and become stunned for a few seconds, and cannot be shot while stunned.I expected this game to be a fun, somewhat tactical shooter and only experienced frustration."
,Not Recommended,278810,16689465,"Posted: 24 June, 2015",all,Ottomic,"LA Cops does the rare thing of combining the worst of Hotline Miami and the worst of Resident Evil 5 without any of the positives.I was kinda interested in this game, seeing how it looked like a 2-character tactical shooter. Looked a bit like HM in that it had quiet planning moments interrupted by bursts of gun action. Seemed okay, so I picked up on the sale.The game looks good, the game does an okay job of telling you the controls, the difficulty curve is reasonable. However LA Cops is hindered by a series of absolutely baffling design choices that run what should be a fun tactical romp into a completely frustrating, sluggish, wasted oportunity of a game. Here are my main gripes with it:- When using keyboard for the first time, you'll get the impression that the game is designed to be played with a controller, since there seems to be a sticky aim, movement with the WASD keys is a bit unresponsive and the angles can be kinda weird. However, playing it with a gamepad you'll get the impression that the game was designed for KBM, because the reticle is used for things such as moving your partner around or selecting the sticky aim, but on controller mode you can only make the reticle move in a predetermined radius around your character. So no matter how you play it, you'll be unconfortable.- Sticky aim doesn't stick to the enemy you want it to stick to. Rather, it will stick to whichever it feels like. This is especially annoying when you're trying to tag an enemy right after telling your buddy to burst in killing everyone, which will result in you failing to tag the enemy and finally just shoot wildly in their general direction which, considering how chaotic combat can get in the game, will probably get your partner, you, or both, killed.- There is no allied AI. You're supposed to be a team of cops, but the only thing your partner will do is stand in place and act as a turret. You will have to tell him/her, EVERY TIME, where to move next. Which, in a game where teamwork and covering each other's backs seems so important, feels even weirder of a mechanic. The game actually kinda picks up when you're left with just one cop, and the mere inclusion of a ""follow me"" command would have turned it into a game *heaps* more pleasant. Enemy AI, when it works, will consist on running up to you, standing there, and shoot. Straightforward, but lacking.- You can't seem to switch cops, despite the prompt telling you to press R to do so. The only time I've been able to switch between my cops is when one of them ""dies"".- AI will derp out, sometimes your buddy will run past an enemy that's shooting him/her, sometimes the goon will ignore them, sometimes they'll get stuck on a door, sometimes will hear stuff they shouldn't be able to hear, and sometimes will not pay attention to something that's happening 5 feet from them. That obviously compounds to the ""I won't move if you don't tell me to"" friendly AI issue mentioned above.- You can't scroll past the boundaries of the screen to check the rest of the map. There is a minimap, which is not explained, and you can zoom out, but you can't see what's a bit further than what's centered on your character, making planning and awareness kinda moot since there's gonna be people coming from places you can't possibly know.- Restarts affect to your score, which kinda bugs me.So, to sum up: it controls weird, it is tedious, both enemies and allies hinder the game flow even further, some expected features half work, others are directly absent from it. My advice is to actually play it before you buy it, because despite looking slick and entertaining, for me it has been an exercise in frustration and unpleasantness.4/10."

,Not Recommended,278810,20951148,"Posted: 4 February, 2016",all,Whiteswart,"jule16 update: still bugged, achievements blocked, nothing changed for more than a year. Who ever praised this game? Except for being a good concept? Phony guys.Top-down-view shooter about ""good"" cops whacking and occasionally arresting some bad mobsters, intriguing by its 70' fuzzy visual style and cover-your-flank-partner mechanics. I'd like to praise that game, I'm really more into upholding law, rather than go frenzy like in the Hotline Miami or Hatred. But at current stage of game development, I really can't vouch for LA Cops. So far it is a broken experience, therefore I suggest you to simply stay aside.Details:Visuals are 70' style, everybody male have mustache or beard, and looks really groovy at first sight. Until you see some ""cutscenes"", especially with Katsuo. Ever heard some noise about facial animations? There are none. Totally faceless characters. That's the point where fuzzy getting into foul.The main problem of the game - is the lack of content. 8 levels of campaign mode can be finished in about hour or two (depends from difficulty level and your luck).Game mechanics are quite simple: you have a level with rooms infested by gangsters, which you need to storm either by yourself, or with help of your partner on crime scene. So you storm the place, kill or incapacitate mobs, complete some secondary goals like freeing the hostage, or destroying the pile of ""drugs"". Simple not mean good, though, for its pretty luck-based. The first levels can be opted by planning-before-moving, but, after 3rd level, you'll see a pure roulette: to kill or to be killed... And since the mobs tends to swarm in packs, and shoot through impenetrable walls once they discover your location, with drastic damage and accuracy... You'll be dying alot out of no reason and thanks to bad camera view angles and not working properly control buttons.The most anticipated - bugs! First, the controls: for some unobvious reasons you can't switch your cops, until you die on mission. After that buttons seems to work... for some time. But the main irritant right now is the fact that you can't finish the game properly - after you deal with the last main mission, and see the credits, your progress with the Casino mission will be forgotten. That means you can't get achievements for completion of the game.Also I've noticed several questionable game design solutions. On the start screen there are only two options, single player or multiplayer. So to quit the game I use Alt+F4. Next dubious thing is that you need to complete every level triple times, since completion on the highest difficulty don't mean you're good with easy and medium difficulties.Conclusion:So far it is not worth any money asked. The amount of content is just slightly more than we had in the demo versions of games not so long ago. Yeah, before they started to sell betas as full-scale games, that is. The whole ""Copper"" thing is not relevant, you're doing almost the same things as in Hotline Miami, just not so messy. And that is thanks to simplified mechanics, compared with That Another Game. So, to answer the question ""Is it a poor man's Hotline Miami?"" - I must say that it is a fair assessment.My mark now will be 4.7/10. I can revise it some time later, if they fix at least problems with achievements... But now, it is broken piece of unfinished code that could be a decent game, were it made properly Before release and sales."

The aiming is sticky and terrible, and the awful 90s console shooter lock on doesn't help. Yes game, I *do* want to aim at the enemy behind a wall in the other room instead of the one right around the corner. There's some perverse enjoyment out of bumrushing thugs toting shotguns to arrest them, but it's not consistent when sometimes the AI just instantly turns around to shoot you in the face. I would have liked tracers (just so I can see where my shots are going) and the look ahead function that Hotline Miami - a game that isn't focused on guns - has because they'd actually be useful here. It would be more bearable with a friend, but sadly only local coop is an option. Don't buy this unless it's like 90% off or something."

,Recommended,278810,11483497,"Posted: 30 July, 2014",all,Hemmingjay,"I LOVE IT! It's a realtime squad based tactical shooter where you can switch between two different cops with the press of a button and the AI takes over the other to shoot but not move. This means you meove your cop into position and face him/her in a direction to cover a doorway or corner and then move the other cop into position, leapfrogging and so on. It makes for fun, tense situations and surprises. Occasionally panicked shootouts occur but most of the time you feel like a badass methodically moving through the building taking out bad guys with one shot. You can pick up their weapons, like shotguns, micro-uzi(semi auto), M79 thumper grenade launcher, M16 assault rifle, and more in the full game I believe. It plays like a combination between a top down/Iso version of Hitman meets Hotline Miami. In fact, It's a LOT like Hotline Miami with two switchable characters. It would be a ton of fun if it was co-op, which I am hoping they find a way to add.The art and music are great. The weapons are satisfying to shoot. The AI is pretty decent already with a few rare idiot moments like getting caught on a doorway, but good overall. The polish of design and mission structure is very good.Now for the bad.......there's not enough of it. Once again an early access game launches with not much more than a proof of concept. I love the game and look forward to it, but I'm not super comfortable with them charging $12 for 1 level of a game that may not get finished if sales aren't decent. I think developers(I am one) need to start being realistic about what they are asking of consumers. Don't ask us to pay full or even half price for a game with less content than a demo that may never be finished. This game once complete would be worth $14 to most of us at most. It will most likely live at $9.99 after it's first month on the market and I feel it should really be priced around that now.The one mission included, Level 5 of 9, has four stages and takes about 20 minutes to play through. I can see myself playing through maybe another 3 times if I get bored. That's an hour of gameplay. I spoke to the developer on the forums and they are awesome, open and friendly. They are not hiding anything and have been wonderful in everyway. It is for that reason that I don't regret my purchase and I can recommend the game to you all. The price is subjective.......great game, little content now.....your choice. They did say they hope to have monthly updates.  I can't wait for the full release."

76561198015198147,Recommended,278810,15647588,"Posted: 1 May, 2015",all,NixonDisapproves,"LA Cops is a strategy(?) game where you control two 70's stereotypes of cops at a time to kill all the criminals. After you get used to the controls, the game works pretty well, but if you're like me, the gameplay is really in the vein of ""where can I put the other CPU cop so that he kills everything for me"".If you really wanted to (and, if you were good at this game) you can finish it in an hour or two.Team 17 really does have a good sense of humor. If you've played any of the ""Worms"" games, you'll see that same sense of humor in THIS game. The real problem here, though, is that when that style of humor is dragged out over a sparse narrative with no substance, it gets stale VERY quickly.This game is fun. Don't get me wrong. So is tossing the dice in Craps. But if the stick-man is throwing out stale, tired tropes about craps at me the whole time I'm playing, I'm moving to another table.Pick up this game if you're looking to play something while something else is downloading. It's cheap, the gameplay is challenging enough to engage you for a little while, but there's nothing much there for you beyond that. That being said, I wish there was a button not to give a ""Yes"" or ""No"", but an ""If you've got some money to blow, and don't care about it"" button."

One of the biggest flaws that I noticed was in certain rooms the floor had lines that confused me and looked like walls, causing me to get shot. The destruction is nice with particles when objects and NPC’s get shot, and colors are bright and vibrant. With a steady 60FPS occasionally dropping to mid 50’s during cut scenes, the overall look and feel of this game is very good.GameplayThis is a very well playing top down game, it is a quick game to pick up and learn, and the tutorial is very fast and easy. The game is fairly well balanced but occasionally an enemy who is faced the opposite way will turn around and kill you immediately. The lock on system is easy to use and works well, but I find it unnecessary as it is smoother to just point and aim.The mini-map is pointless, made small and shoved into the corner, I find myself forgetting it’s even there. The weapons are well balanced and designed. The NPC is either half brain dead or Einstein, when it comes to finding where you are. The missions and cut scenes are funny and entertaining enough to keep me enjoying the game. Overall the game is quite enjoyable and is very funny, but is not very entertaining the second time around.ControlsThe controls are decent, with the aiming and lock-on system being this games forte. The viewing controls are great with easy to use zooming and rotation of the camera, it is easy to see big parts of the map so that you can plan out your next move. The only thing I didn’t care for was the movement system, the WASD movement system is setup in a way that W is always up and accordingly for the other keys. Normally in a top-down this is no problem at all, but this game’s maps are oriented very diagonally making it challenging to move in the way you want to, leaving you vulnerable and open to enemy fire.StoryThe story is funny and entertaining, with the cut scenes being my favorite parts, this will keep you intrigued though the whole story. With a theme of 70’s cops in LA doing crazy jobs from hold ups to drug deals, and music to match, the story is very well laid out. My only complaint being that it is a very short 8 levels.AchievementsWith only 13 quick and easy achievements, the game seemed somewhat short. Though a few were a challenge to get.OverallOverall, I think this was a very fun and entertaining game, with good graphics and a well thought out story, I found this to be quite a good game. With an original purchase price of $14.99 on Steam, I would wait to get a sale on the game as I don’t feel it is wholly worth that price."

Let's break it down shall we=======The Good=======- Idea/ Theme - The idea of playing a old style L.A cop in a top down shooter is a interesting idea.- Graphics - I do enjoy the graphics/looks of it, it's not over the top and doesn't feel awkard or painful to look at. Some might see this different but I do enjoy the look of it=======The bad=======- Friendly A.I - Having played this on the most recent version at the time of this review, I have to say the A.I is still bad, my partner can only shoot within a radius about maybe 5m in a cone shape, if he is shot from behind he will take forever to turn around leading to his death. If a enemy is using a rifle and stands just outside the cone he will kill my partner. If my partner is in a tight corner of a room, he will get stuck and won't return fire if the enemy is in his face. I was hoping with the leveling system that the more you level the better radius my partner can see, better reaction and so forth...sadly that isn't here and most times I find I have to hide my partner and use them whenever I need a quick heal.- Enemy A.I - The enemy A.I is 50/50 sometimes they will shoot through a corner that even you don't have the angle to shoot from, they sometimes get stuck on doors, blindly charge to your location (was hoping they would take cover or call for help or something) and sometimes they don't shoot even if they are 2 steps away (found that when they have the grenade launcher they just charge until they are 1 step away from you...it's rather strange.- Civillans - Down the road you will meet some friendly npcs however they just run around screaming asking for help, I found myself charging them to secure them hoping to put cuffs on them or escort them out so they are both out of my way and score maybe some points...I found this doesn't exist and most missions I find the enemy shooting through them without damaging the civillans meanwhile they would eat my bullets and charging me -200 points on my score.  They become annoying as you want to avoid shooting them but find yourself in the position of saying hell with it and killing everyone in sight just to be over with it.-Combat/Controls- Sometimes I found aiming and shooting not responding correctly. I was aiming at one enemy close range and my character somehow aimed above the enemy's head and at a bookcase behind him...this is even using the lock on feature and having a max character. I find this happening a few times throughout my playthrough.======The Mix======- Story - It's ok for what it is but didn't feelt excited or interested really- Missions - the missions are rather straight forward, you have 8 story plus a few extra side missions, this you can blow through pretty fast especially if your a hotline player as you will find this so much easier to fly through. If you haven't then you might face some trouble now and then at certain points but it's very easy to get by once you figure out the routine and camping spots. Most missions within the story are clear, hold out and destroy a few items with the odd boss now and then.- Leveling system - Neat to have a little leveling system in which you improve your character's speed , damage and even loadout. However you can't hold a secondary weapon when carrying a large weapon, I found this annoying as most police type games will allow you to carry a secondary and primary helping solve ammo issues. Not sure why they choose this way but I found myself running into large rooms of enemy and running out of ammo forcing to charge with the melee attack...oh yeah they be afraid of my handcuffs alright :P=====Overall=====It's something neat to play around with or if your wanting some quick easy achievements however I would wait for a sale as there isn't much replay value, I know the devs have been adding improvements and adding missions but at the moment and with most players coming from Hotline, they will feel like this is nothing and burn through the content way too fast to make it worth the full price."

Looks like an isometric but you can change the cam and has a variety of tactical options. This is a very tidy game for a top down shooter. Picked this up in early access with 2 levels and they've come along nicely. Think its time to pick it up again

With this kind of game, I think they should either go with a hotline miami top down view or change the gameplay to an xcom turned based style game. There is a mix between the 2 since you can set up your 2nd cop to auto shoot anyone in his line of site but then it just makes it cheap as he never seems to miss.I also feel like you should be able to kick the doors in, I mean you ARE cops!Obviously, this is an early build. I am intrigued to see how it goes at launch but for now I feel like the game hasn't found the right balance yet to achieve me feeling like a bad♥♥♥♥♥cop out of old school miami vice."

It's very much like Hotline Miami just with 3d graphics and two characters which makes the game a bit more tactical.  I hope dev will go the 'tactical' path and add more stances, cover system and maybe like add automatic action system for the inactive player?It really Early Access. To be honest it's as early as you can get ;) I would say if you really like Hotline Miami and 70' cops theme and like to find bugs and maybe have an active role in game development then go for it. If not then just wait for more content and see what direction the devs will go.Here you can see a simple playthrough and see game mechanics:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR66g6834zw"

But the Devs have quickly fixed this within a month, and now there is some 5 20min levels. The game itself is amazing. You control 2 cops, move them both around and all, by switching in between them at will. The gameplay is satisfiying,the story is kinda...weird, but the levels are all great and will make you want to play them again and again.Also, the game has tons of nostolgia behind it. Plenty of referances Hawaii 5-0, Batman, and old TV shows, which, to this day, I enjoy more then anything else.This game is a must buy for 70's cop show lovers, and if you're not, well, wait for a sale or just buy it right away, because,well,its pretty goodIts short, maybe 30 mins. But god its brilliant. Spot on gameplay, amazing music, and its just...brilliant...That being said, the reason I gave it a thumbs down is because it will only last 30 mins at most. If your looking for a game to hold you off until Hotline 2, this is it. Just wait a bit longer. $12 is a lot for 30 minsOk, ill post this here again.Chuck G Nukem Givn awy Hitmn Abs Just now@AronI know that. And as I said to foxyshadis, the second that this game gets one more level, I will update this review to a thumbs up. I love the game, its a game version of Hawaii 5-0, and cmon, who wouldnt love that(One of the guys names is even williams) BUTI want people to see that as of this date, the game has 30mins-1hr.Aron 7 hours agoHey there, thanks for the review. I'm an animator on this team and just wanted to chime in and mentioned that while the early access version is only 1 level, the full version is 8 levels, so there is a lot more content than 30 mins. There's hours of fun to be had!Chuck G Nukem Givn awy Hitmn Abs Aug 1 @ 10:16pm  Delete@foxshadisEven so, i'm reviewing the game as is.The second they add another level or two, I will update this game and give it a thumbs up. But I want to people to realize-At this date, 8/1/14, there is one level in the game.foxyshadis Aug 1 @ 8:57pmTheir statement says that the main priority for the final game is making more levels.The above is the reason I gave it a thumbs down. I love the game, but there isn't much game here. As soon as they add another level, I will update this review and give it a thumbs up"

Art style, shooting mechanics, and characters are on point; but, there are a few quibbles that I have with this game. The controls, and switiching between them, is a bit groggy and either control set makes the menus very hard to navigate. The XP system is largely flawed as well. Some one can constantly mine the first mission until they have a fully upgraded chsracter, making the rest of the game too easy and repetitive. I really want to reccomend this game more but this seemingly easy fixes that havent been fixed are holding me back. I will reccomend it none-the-less  because of all the potential it has and to send a message to other developers that topdown shooters like this should be made more often."

Before buying I was aware that there were only two levels available and I made the decision to purchase to help support the further development. Normally I hate top-down shooters. But when they are done right - and this is done right - then they can be great fun. If they continue to expand on the game and not screw up the best attributes then this will be firmly set in its place as one of history's few truly awesome top-down shooter/strategy games.
