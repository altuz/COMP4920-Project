There's very few levels and once you beat it (took about 20 minutes) there's nothing else to do, you just start over again with the same characters, same levels, same everything. It's fun for about 10 or so minutes, but after that it feels like nothing more than a quick smartphone app."

Which is cool if you like that kind of game, but beating each stage isn't satisfying enough. There's no challenge or concept that draws you in. I don't have to rack my brain to find new and interesting ways to pass the obstacles, nor am I met with any surprise at any point in each level. There are other things wrong, and other things right with the game, but at its core it's just not that fun. That's really all there is to it. If you catch it on sale, sure. Go ahead and grab it for 75 cents. But I can't help but to feel a little cheated having actually paid for a game I could have just as easily found a more fun version of on Newgrounds."

Levels are not random, and there are not many powerups. This is a challenging classic platformer (as was common in the NES days).That said, if you like classic platformers this one is not bad.All equipment has a limited number of uses. All weapons and armor collapse and break after it is used 1-4 times. Oils are found occasionally, and can be used to fully repair an armor or weapon while at the same time converting it into another type of armor or weapon.Levels are linear and the game is fairly short. There are a number of character classes which differ only in their starting equipment, and there is some replayability to be had in beating the game with different classes.You won't get many hours of entertainment with this, but it's brief and enjoyable fun and the price is right.Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here"

I don't know what it is about Indie games but as soon as the developers start making quality games instead of just rehashing content from prequels or charging over the mark for content that just isn't worth it then you find something worth buying.That's one of those games, a modest price and some good random fun (literally). There's a random character option that adds a bit of depth along with the somewhat random monster spawns and drops from chests that really make this game fun. It's simple yet not in a bad way, keeps you entertained and has an excellent price as well...what more could I ask for?Well, I wouldn't say no to some additional content, but I'm by no means asking or demanding it.

It isn't as much of a ""rogue-like"" as a platformer with ""rogue-lite"" bits -- mild randomization of enemy placement and items, but the level layouts and hazards don't change.At first I was kinda disappointed that dying means restarting from the beginning, but it's not annoyingly hard, like some of the cheap platformers I've got that ape the NES era. If you avoid enemies and pick your battles, you'll make progress without too much trouble! :)I suppose they could do a bit of a better job explaining some of the mechanics. (I have no idea why laying eggs is a thing, for example.)If you're looking for a fun, light-hearted platformer, this does the trick! It's affordable and pleasant. Give it a chance! :3"
,Recommended,278890,15562471,"Posted: 26 April, 2015",all,Pool Noodle,"Wow, this game was hard. I just finished grabbing all the achievements, logging in about 17 hours, I think? And a good chunk of those were spent on the 5 star difficulty level.The art is simple and controls are easy to understand (I used a controller), so it's easy to get started, but you'll be dying at about every corner as you progress. That's normal. There's a 'great guy' option when choosing your character that starts at one star difficulty and randomizes your character (and the map to some extent in later difficulties). When you beat it two star unlocks, and so on. Birds can be hatched from eggs dropped by all sorts of enemies (Like monkeys!) and the type of bird depends on what hat you're wearing, and weapons and armor can be changed with 'oils.' The classes were simple, a few being more interesting than others. The king is the most OP with full armor and a sword, the bottler has oils and no weapons, and the peasant doesn't get any armor drops throughout the whole game. There are a few more, too.I didn't really experience any bugs, but sometimes as shepard my sheep would somehow appear in the ground instead of the air and couldn't move.... which was interesting.Overall, good platformer with relentless enemies and solid gameplay. I enjoyed it while playing but now that I've beaten it I'm not sure I would want to go through 5 star difficulty again."

There's no story here.You pass between forest, castle, desert, water temple, haunted house, and dungeon.The one problem with this game is that the level design is always the same, but harder difficulties add more enemies. Therefore, the more you play, the easier it becomes as treasure chests always spawn in the same place. Additionally, the higher difficulties quickly become bullet hell.If you like games that can be played in 10 minutes or less and you line 2D platformers, this one is a steal.I think a lot of people get discouraged due to the difficulty as only 15% of all players have actually beaten it."

,Recommended,278890,9379996,"Posted: 7 March, 2014",all,bad,"Angvik is a simple platformer with a couple of neat ideas and a very charming atmosphere. It starts by getting the basics of platforming right, and follows with an inventory system that takes some thought and practice to master. The atmosphere created by the music and graphics is very relaxing, even though the game can be challenging at times. I really appriciated the creatively drawn enemies and items. My only issue is that each time you die you have to play through from the first level again, which can be repetitive since there is little variation from game to game and it becomes a basic excercise pretty quickly. There's not much replay value for the same reason, that only some enemy spawns and items are randomized. But overall, I would recommend this game for the price. It creates a great atmosphere and has solid platforming with an interesting twist, just don't expect a long experience or great replayability."

Anyway it doesnt get boring due changing enemy locations and weapons. It keeps motivating me, because it feels very fluent and even after learning the first level by heart, it is still a challenge not to get hit.

Only the controls are kinda weird, i would recommend changing them before playing.However i recommend Anvik for everyone who wants to be challenged, the game is easily worth its prize.Congratulations to the maker, hope he reads it :)"

The art is done nicely also, very calming, just like the music in the game. There are aspects that are like other RPG games, such as the ability to pick a class as well. I do find myself getting close to rage quitting occasionally because of how easy it is to die, but I also find that because of the calm nature of the game it makes dying a lot less of a pain.The only thing I think this game would benefit from is a check-point system. Like everytime you reach a new area, if you die, then you would spawn at the beginning of the area instead of having to replay the entire map. However, I still suggest this game. It is an excellent time killer and is very relaxing."

After playing Angvik for little over half an hour I can say there wasn't anything that ever really grabbed my attention to keep playing. It wasn't unplayable or anything. The art style was probably the part I enjoyed the most. It's not a terrible game by any means, but there's nothing to special about it either.

You can have more than one weapon at once, BUT the weapons have durability. You can jump on enemies, similar to the Mario or DK series. You can use oils to change the quality of your equipment.

,Recommended,278890,9246944,"Posted: 24 February, 2014",all,BallsDeep69,"Revised Review!!!Angvik is a pretty good time killer. I've just completed the game completely, from start to finish. It took me about 3 or 4 hours to do all together. That's including my rage quitting and deaths and all that. Failed runs, etc.The game is a great deal of fun, and highly addiction. There are a few bugs or maybe minor glitches. One of which has to do with getting caught on certain ""ramp"" surfaces as you walk. Simple, just jump . It's not really consistant with any interaction from what I've seen, and it's fairly rare.The boss fight at the end is somewhat challenging. Just know that if you don't have armor in the slightest or at least a decent weapon then you're almost certainly going to lose unless you're particularly good at this sort of thing. I won't spoil it for you, but just know the game ends with a boss fight.That being said, the game ended rather lacklusterly for me. I was hoping there would be more, perhaps an unlockable or somewhat, but it doesn't seem to be so. It's simple ""you won!"" and then the credits. The only other thing it seems is that there are higher ""difficulties"" as shown by how many stars are under the ""Great Guy"" sort of ""Class"" thing. I have two stars now, and giving a quick run through the first level, it seems that the amount of enemies that are in a given level are increased, thus making it more difficult. So it still has some replayability to it. That being said, the game itself is a whopping 2 dollars, so what can you expect, right? The game could easily sell for 5 dollars, though. It is fantastic.There are plenty of unique weapons, and the ""oils"" system is wonderful, though some seem to be fairly useless. The bird system I figured out is not useless. There are some enemies that are just total pains in the♥♥♥♥♥ but so long as you don't agro them they won't move, or some of them don't move much at all. That's when you whip out your bird eggs and hope they hit, which they usually will.Also, a neat little feature is the subtle aging of your character as you progress through each level as a sort of ""timer"". At some point, though I didn't count it specifically, it will show you a prompt which says you're getting old and you better hurry up! I thought this was pretty cool.9/10.-----------------------------------------Previous Review----------------------------------------------Angvik is a pretty decent time killer. It's challenging, from what I've played of it. I've gotten to the second level, after about 30 minutes of failing repeatedly! You're going to die a LOT. The combat is fluid and simple, but still hard as hell. There's a variety of different enemies, weapons, and classes. Classes, however, seem to be more or less for your starting items. You can't go wrong with the King class.Complaints? Well, a few. It just throws you into the game giving you no idea of what exactly to do, aside from a few little things. The bird system I don't want to say is useless, but it's useless if they don't tell you what it's actually for. From what I see it seems to be some kind of temporary orbiting attack bird that kills any enemies it touches. At least, I think that's what it does if it were to actually touch an enemy! However, I'm probably just awful at aiming it/timing it. It could be interesting.They don't tell you what exactly the point of the game is, how many levels, or what certain items such as armor and weapons do. You have to find out the hard way, which I almost like. I found out that the king's armor can reflect ranged attacks, which is cool.For the low low price of whatever it says up there I would definitely get this game - as I already did on a whim. It's a good game for casual people, and if you like RPG's like this and semi-rogue likes (Not procedurally generated, but still one life idea) you'll have a lot of fun. It's fairly addicting - while still being quite possible to rage quit from dying so often!I'd give it a 7.5/10. -2.5 for the issues I stated earlier."

I'd say wait till it goes on sale again because $3.00 is a little much for what's there. The melody in the background is great when you're feeling stressed and matches with the theme in the game. I always felt like the bad guy because your character interupts the mostly peaceful world, but their all against you so I don't feel that bad. There is an upgrade system incorperated with oils (black oil is the best). Though it's no Mario, it is a good distraction if you need to keep your hands busy while paying attention to something else. There is little completionist value, but a good little game nonetheless. The game has enough variety to keep you playing until you win and if nothing else, you'll play to see what different weapons/armor you can get. As for the controls, I haven't really have a problem, but a controller might be needed for some players but platformers like super meatboy are far superior, so either spend the money for a mild, lightened platformer or save for the better games."

The ""game"" in all takes about 10 minutes to beat once you understand how it works, and replay value is very low. The only things that change are what character you play and what enemies get generated in each level. Hitting enemies is frustrating; thrown weapons often skim enemies without killing them, and stomping heads is difficult given varying enemy traits - s♥♥♥♥♥dic movements, rapid ranged attacks that are hard to dodge, slim enemy hitboxes, A lot of times, avoiding enemies entirely is the best option, which is incredibly unfortunate given killing enemies is about the only thing to do.

Some examples would be:- it's a platform game, but with very unique lands, yes they may look like other games (for me they looked a bit like Kirby's Epic Yarn maps..) but they have very different ""monsters"" and obstacals which I have not seen used before.- The characters are very cute- The music is okay..- The price is good, I would have actually paid a little more for thisSo the game does have it's ""pros"" but I have not recommended it for these reasons:- The screen moves with the avatar- which you would expect, but it's a bit fast and jolty, after a while it actually made my eyes/brain hurt xD- The controls are really confusing. At the start it does not tell you what any of the controls are (they aren't the normal W,D,S and A) so you have to try and navigate your way to the options menu- and then change them. But I think there are too many options, for example the character can hold two weapons at a time which do different things- you also need two different keys to use them... but which ones do you choose?! You will forever be trying to find which keys you are confortable using and positioning them close enough together so you don't have to use the whole key board!- There really needs to be check points. When you die you literally restart the game and choose a new avatar and lose any new potions/weapons/armour you find.- Dying is very easy, which I guess makes this game a little challenging- there's nothing wrong with that. It's just when you can lose all your armour- that does not protect you anyway- then die.. and restart.. It's just a bit annoying..- Finally some of the characters throw their weapon (usually misses target) and then you have to walk and find it.... there could easily be more monsters ready to kill you that second and you will not have a weapon...I can just about carry on playing.As I said ""there's not much to it"" it's just very simple.5/10 would die every 2 seconds again..ALSO! this game reminds me of ""ghouls 'n' ghosts"" (1988) Same idea of losing armour?"

You can take a couple of hits and if you die it's straight back to the start, similar to many old nes games.

It's usually about 20 metres to the right of your father. The game is very enjoyable and amusing at times. There is no storyline and the game is literally just about getting as far as you can before you die.

The world of Angvik is kind of similar to the world of Super Ghouls and Ghosts; everything that moves (except your helpful bird buddies) will kill you, or at least cause you to shed a protective layer of armour. Oh, and some stationary things will kill you too.I'm sure this will get infuriating eventually, but honestly everything is just so darn charming and adorable that I don't mind the endless death so much. You kill your adorable enemies and get items, sometimes weapons, sometimes armour, sometimes other stuff, sometimes eggs, and you give the eggs to your bird friend and your bird friend shouts ""bird!"" Or ""egg!"" Then the egg hatches into another bird, which will get killed so that you can live for another ten seconds or so. Then the next plant or fish or menacing coral thing touches you and your clothes pop off and you die. And this nice soothing music plays and it's all quite lovely really."

If nothing else, it does evoke that old feeling one can get from other platformers where maybe you'll get it on the next run. The mechanics are good, the difficulty is quite welcome... It's just a little on the short side. With no two runs being the same, that's not much of an issue, though."

,Recommended,278890,9283362,"Posted: 27 February, 2014",all,scrypt,"A peaceful, fantasy, perma-death platformer, set to an idyllic score. Make your way through each level, picking up loot from chests and fallen baddies, with a few secrets here and there. Even has weapon modification by way of potion additives. The weapons deteriorate from use, and your character ages from beginning to the end of each level, eventually dying if you don't complete the level in time (age resets at the start of new levels). Short, but sweet, and the increasing difficulty of the play+ gives a reason to keep coming back. A much better investment than a cup of coffee! Built with the Construct 2 game engine!I was using an XBox 360 wireless controller during play, and I noticed that there were a few instances where I'd land on a platform and just start unintentionall moving. This caused problems when precision was key, but it didn't happen often at all. It could have just been lag from the controller, too."

You can be so many diffrent things, with armor, weapons and the birds you find. The potions are cool too. But this game is really, REALLY hard. If you die you have to start from the very begining of this long game and then you have to use the weird controls to pick your ""father"" all over again. It would be nice if it could remember which ""father"" you selected last and when you died it started off with that one highlighted and ready for you to press the s button on to select it. Being an amateur programmer who will probably never be as good at programming a Alastair john Jack is, it would be pretty simple to implement this. Maybe not now after so much has been done to this game already, but yeah. But I actually really like this game and it is beautiful in audio, visuals and creativiy. I love the style and entire games of Alastair John Jack but this game is really just too difficult. I know it would make the game really easy with checkpoints but right now it is. Great job on this game AJJ, and I never meant to to put him down at all in this review, I am just speaking my mind. Great game, high difficulty."

Having two weopons with the option to mod them with oils is ace, and the durability factor on each keeps gameplay balanced once you have really powerful weapons. The hidden extras make it worthwhile to do a little bit of exploring, and have the character age instead of have a timer tell you how much time left in a level is a cool idea."
