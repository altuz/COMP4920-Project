But where the game really excells, is in the multiplayer.Play with at least three people and watch the chaos unfold. Pacts are made, truces broken and backs are stabbed.The only recommendations i would make to the developers:- Add more research; the skill tree is largely resource boosters. Perhaps some more unlockable buildings or weapons?- Different difficulties for AI- The ability to set teams before launching a game- More variety in buildings would be nice too, and perhaps the option to upgrade/specialize a cityThe points mentioned are not essential to have in this game! All of them would, however, make the game better (in my opinion).Conclusion:8/10, this game has a lot of potential!"
76561198060204114,Recommended,278910,15819673,"Posted: 13 May, 2015",all,EdgeOfNothing,"I've been following this game since late 2013 when I got it, and since then it has turned out to be one of the best $5 I spent. Granted, that was on sale when it was in beta, so it's increased to 15, with a good sale going probably from 10-12, but the game is still a very good, if not an amazing buy.Pros (As of May 13, 2015. Initial release):+No issues with large lobbies anymore. Large lobbies are supported and quite awesome.+Cool graphics. You can see every shot with very little FPS drop.+From what my friends and I have tried and tested, the game seems decently balanced, from early rushes to late game turtle.+Full, 26 piece tech tree that ensures that you can't simply rush in one direction without feeling the loss in other sectors. For example, if you singlemindedly rush lasers, you won't be able to build any defenses to counter the railguns that someone else built for half the cost and time.+n-body physics on the main game map. Now I get it, a game about firing weapons through outer space better have a good physics engine, but this game is just awesome. Every massive (e.g. not weapons) body in the game exerts a force on projectiles, to the point where a gas giant that's behind your planet will mess up your firing arcs pointing in front of you. It can be frustrating, but its the best part and main attraction of the game.+Non-instantaneous projectiles mean that you have to do some aiming at your target rather than just pointing your guns at them.+Different level AI. Given that I haven't tried too many of them out, but still they offer training before you hit the scary players out there.+Intuitive building mechanics. Everything makes sense pretty much instantly. You have two resources, balance them.+Customizable lobbies. No more are games confined to 5 cities and 100000 minerals, but these are now modifiable for custom gaming. These, along with other things (like what weapons can be built, what size planets are, etc.), are nearly fully variable! This includes making games private so that only your friends can join.+Turn timers. This was important, because people could sit in a game, raging, and never passing their turn. That would cause the game to stall out, but now with turn timers, that happens no more! Eat it, sore losers.Neutrals:Turn timer only goes up to three minutes, which isn't enough in the late game.Music is very good, but it is on loop and there isn't too much variety (About 8ish minutes of it, I THINK), but you can mute it and play your own in the background.One game has a length of anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on how slow the starts are and how long it takes to get lucky with damage distributions.Cons:-Has two decently sized bugs. One freezes the turn permanently if everyone in the game has passed except one. If that one person leaves the game instead of ending his turn, the game bugs out, sadly. The other is minor and easily fixable if you hit enough random buttons: the missile lock is funky. If you don't click on a target planet fast enough you screen looses its UI and you have to hit escape to go to the pause menu. When you come back, everything is fixed.-Not a huge community. Before the game was fully released (i.e. beta) there was a very small community which could barely field a few pick-up games a day. Today there were lobbies open at all times though. Seems the release has breathed new life here.-Game incorporates randomness in play affecting areas. Everyone's population and science increase at slightly different rates, meaning that you can never quite have the same opener/information on all players. On turn 10 of one game, a certain tech may be 1 turn research, where in another game it is 2 turns. Not huge, but for the hardcore people like myself, this can, in theory, hurt a few games in a hundred.-Learning curve exists. While a pro to some people due to it's depth and skill based gaming, this means that you WILL lose your first game against random players. Hopefully you will be talking in chat the whole way with more experienced players who can teach you the ropes, but maybe not.-Slight runaway leader scenario. The player with the better economy on turn ten will also have a better econ on turn 20, and 30 and 40... If you try and build a ton of railguns or lasers to hit the guy who is shooting you every turn with 10+, you are going to lose the war. If you try and fight fire with fire, you are going to get burned. Sadly, this is the most intuitive way to go about playing, and some people might call certain strategies unbalanced as a result.-+-All in all, if you like not-casual-but-not-super-competitive games about space, and/or artillery, and/or resource management, then this game could be for you. It certainly was for me. It is 100% worth the $11.99 on sale, and it's almost surely worth the $15 normal price. It's been a fun 80 hours, and I put in about 8 a week.(Buy this game.)(Do it.)"

Destroying enemy planets with WMD's is awesome whether AI or another player. I decided to write this review because of the update that has just been announced. It's nice to see the dev coming back and re-working the game for their players. I look forward to the new features and stabilization. When the update releases, I believe it would be a good time to get into the game. The most fun I had with this game was when playing hot-seat, so I'd imagine online play would be cool as well. I've never found an online game, but if you have some friends with it, definitely get one going. I'm always down to play too, hit me up."
,Not Recommended,278910,20114514,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,Seldon,"Interesting concept, horrendous execution.Projectile combat is just a guessing game, one that can simply be reduced to ""attack when you're ahead of the enemy's orbit and there are zero obstacles in your way."" The only way to reliably get hits is to let your attacks fall into the target's gravity well. There's zero room for interesting maneuvers because you can't see or reliably guess where the future positions of the planets will be, and you can't adjust any its trajectory mid-flight.Lasers trump everything. The only thing balancing it is that it has a small radius and that you need to have intel to really make use of it, but intel/counterintel is just a resource sink, i.e. can I build Telescope Arrays faster than the enemy builds Data Security Hubs?Strategy-wise this game sucks, especially if you have more than two players. The innermost and outermost players inherently have a strategic advantage compared to the ones in the middle because there are fewer attack approaches. City placement is random and it's much better to have cities that are relatively closer for shielding purposes.It's not in your best interest to shoot first because that draws away energy that could be used for defense/construction. Since you can't loot enemies for resources, the only strategic advantage that you get from it is that you remove a threat, which quickly dwindles to nothing the more players there are. Thus it favors defensive strategies over offensive ones, i.e. just keep building until you strip the planet dry before making a move. Also, a 3+ player free-for-all becomes a Mexican standoff, which disincentivizes attacking even further.Honestly the game is just a one-trick pony that actually kinda fails on its selling gimmick. The physics simulation in the game is ridiculously simplified: it's all in the 2D plane and it's no more complicated than eyeballing it. Approach vectors don't matter; the only thing the game cares about is that the shot connects. Which makes no sense for, well, a freaking railgun whose projectiles are governed by orbital mechanics. For instance, tripling the impact velocity should increase the damage by roughly an order of magnitude, which would also be nice because it would reward more difficult (i.e. moving, not falling) shots.Also, the interface is clunky but at least that can be fixed."

I'd expect this in a pre-alpha, but for $15?  Really?  I feel like a Kickstarter idiot lately as the amount of half-baked not ready for release games lately is amazing.You know it's about to crash when the interface starts glitching.  But then the save function usually doesn't work.  I guess I could save religiously every ten turns or so, but when playing vs other players?  ""sorry - have to save"" - Give me a few minutes and re-join...2: The cheating AI aside, the interface is atrocious.  You want to be able to plan ahead, but there is no overlay to see your positions on your planet from a distance ( ie - red dots as it rotates), so you are never sure if your planet will rotate enough to get a shot off the next turn.  Also, when you are going to take damage, you don't SEE it hit.  Most of the fun in these types of games is seeing the shot and what it damages in real time.  You might as well skip the animation in this one - fire, come back, zoom into your planet to see what was hit.In a typical artillery type of game, you can see your shots, where they flew, and how to adjust to hit the enemy.To add insult to injury, the cities are the most hidden/first to be made not visible items???  And if the enemy has enough stealth, you simply forget their location?  You can't even remember what you saw last turn?3: Playing with the AI is useless unless you turtle for 40 turns or just build 10-20 ( not joking ) railguns and idiot-spam them.PVP:Now, it is good playing hotseat, which is fun, but the time required to do so is hugely prohibitive.  The issue is that playing versus humans nets a 3-4 hour stalemate due to the only way to really do damage are superweapons.  If they make a grid of defenses over each city, and start building some stealth, you're going to waste the next few hours doing nothing. (ie - turn 40+)  Your railguns are not aimable, your missiles can't get through the kinetic defenses ( can't aim them unless you have a visual target), and lasers are the only thing that can consistently hit cities.  Until they get laser shielding.  Maybe you get lucky and take out one city with railgun spamming, but it takes all five dead to win.  You can take out a few things, but the cities are the only thing that matters.  Once those have 2-3 defenses on top of them, you're into the endgame:A: lob an asteroid and hope it hits something useful and critical/not fixable as it's random.B: Fire your one super laser and take out a single building or damage part of a city.C: wish the interface would stop forcing you to do your research queue when all you want to do is fire and get on to the next round.As it is, my son and I have played for 4 hours and still not finished a game before it crashed one of our two systems.Two copies, $30 wasted.  I should have just bought a game for my console instead."

This sounds easy enough but you'll find that when you need to shoot your opponents, your railgun will be facing the other direction due to your planet's rotation. Your lasers don't hit anything but air and empty soil because your opponent has worked on counterinteligence, and your missiles were brought off course by the gravity well of a passing gas giant. He takes the shot, but misses you just barely. And the gravity well of your planet redirects those railgun shots right into the orbit of a third player.I did not expect it, but it is surprisingly challenging in your tactical and strategic choices. Do you build everything nearby so the early game railguns will do barely any damage at all, with everything you have fitting nicely under one defence structure... or do you spread out everything so a superweapon can't hit everything at the same time and destroy half your buildings with one well placed shot? Who do you aim at first? That guy who keeps shooting railguns at you and is obviously out for blood, or the guy who is peacefully building his war machine with mines and data security centers? The list goes on, but it has more than enough variety to allow for plenty of experimenting while it avoids having a single strategy that will always come out as the best.It is certainly worth giving a try, with plenty of decisions and choices to keep you thinking, but fast paced enough to get through a game without spending your whole day on it. (Average, casual games I played with friends lasted about 1-2 hours)For 10 euro, I would say it's worth it and recommend giving it a go. If you're not convinced, keep an eye on this one for when it goes on sale"

Primarily the balance of weapons and defences is very far off. When your planet is hit with a railgun round, the round splits in atmo into 5 or so chunks that cause quite a bit of damage. Your kinetic defences that you've hopefully deployed cover a very small area... and guess what, railgun rounds have a large area of effect, so when a round hits even just outside of your defences, it causes damage everywhere. If you possess the power to hurtle cannon rounds across your solar system, you should have the ability to build defences that cover a much larger area of your planet. Another smaller issue I have is that when going up against more than one AI player, they are practically unbeatable. They build faster, and are far more accurate than you will ever be.TLDR: kinetic defences are almost useless, and shouldn't be. And the AI is very powerful. Like Matrix level."

The control scheme is well-integrated into the game, making it very playable with minimal game knowledge; it also has a very highreplayability factor, since the nature of the simulation ensures that no two games are the same. All in all, well worth the purchase price.However, the game is not without room for improvement: I do think putting connection and upgrade trackers on the top-screen city bar would be a pretty nice addition. Also, the game assumes zero deviation from the ecliptic, meaning that all the planets -- and other objects -- in the system orbit and move otherwise in a single two-dimensional plane, neither ""rising above"" nor ""falling below"" the average orbital plane. The game assumes perfectly circular orbits, too. I'dloveto see this kind of thing with some deviated orbits, like arealstar system. Now THAT would be a great game!"

If you've ever played any of the Worms games, or any tank battle turn based game, this game takes it to a new level. Build your interplanetary defenses and weapons and unlease a volley of attacks on other planets. Sounds easy, until you realize the red targeting line isn't going to take into account planetary movement and the influence of the gravitational pull of the other planets moving in the solar system. Takes a bit of though, but of gut calculation, and a bit of luck at times to really hit your enemies home with your weapons.Pros:- Awesome concept executed well- Resource management is simple, yet forces decision making. Do I want more new weapons or defenses next turn, or do I want to attempt to do more damage now?Hopes:- I hope you'll be able to designate names for your missiles, because if you have half a dozen, but did specific upgrades to some and not others, it's hard to figure out which missile has the upgrades. And I didn't see a specific name for the individual missiles like I did in targeting mode.- Maybe have a variety of orbit types?- Take over other planets or moons?- More weapons"

But there are some major problems:- Most of the player's time is spent doing tedious and annoying things that feel like chores. Iterating through every single building one by one to apply an upgrade, or painstakingly aiming every single missile one by one through a series of twists and turns across the solar system... only to have them all miss the target. Even navigating through the different views sucks up time, because you have to wait for the camera to finish spazzing out every single time.- Secondly, there aren't a lot of meaningful choices for the player to make. There's no real incentive to focus on offense, which makes the game drag on for even longer.  A lot of the items in the tech tree are pointless, the same goes for a lot of projects. Play one game, or at the very most two, and you'll see how a large portion of the game can mostly be ignored.

And I do mean absolutely brilliant.It's not often a game comes along that both manages to be incredibly simple and yet so magnificently complex. And that's the true beauty of Interplanetary.Despite being a strategy game, despite having tech trees and build units and economy etc. Interplanetary, threw virtue of an intuitive interface, tooltips that tell you exactly what you need to know, and combat that centres around a simple yet unique mechanic, manages to be a game anyone could pick up and within minutes understand everything they need to know in order to enjoy playing.What is that central mechanic you might ask? Well to put it simply, gravity. Interplanetary is a game were you construct weapons, defences, and resource buildings in order to fling tiny little projectiles of mass destruction. During each turn you lock in your trajectories, cross your fingers, and watch as your planets death balls of destruction fly across the screen. ""Did you guess the orbits properly? Will that planets gravity be enough to align the shot? What if the turn accelerates the missile too fast?"" These questions and more will be ricocheting across your head as you cross your fingers and pray your little shots hit. And the ones coming towards you don't.And that's just what's so wonderful about interplanetary. Even with such simplistic gameplay it will have you on the edge of your seat nervously waiting between each and every turn, completely absorbed in the interactions of these little planets and their annoying to predict orbits. It lands perfectly in that ""easy to learn, hard to master"" spot.

Sometimes people will bombard your planet with railgun shots on the second turn, and sometimes no shots will be fired until somebody calls in an asteroid. The tech tree fits the length of the game perfectly, as well as it is almost 100% balanced. The new upgrade feature really adds another dimension to the optimal play-style, as it allows for more energy and materials to be produced in a smaller area. The array of weapons that you can arm your planet with is grand, be it with pinpoint accuracy lasers or homing missiles. One of the best, but most complicated parts of the combat system is the gravity of the planets and the sun. You could aim a shot so that it looks like it will be spot on, but then the planets will orbit and gravity will throw the shot out of the system. All in all, this game was definately a 10/10, I hope to see many new features in the future."

Bottom line up front:  good game with a lot of potential.  It's worth a look if you dig this sort of stuff.Yes, ""a lot of potential"" means it's not quite there yet.  Stop right there if you're thinking, ""Yeah but it's early access.""  Early access should entice the gamer to want more, not frustrate with a product that they won't want even when it's complete.   Even science fiction has a logic that binds it together to make it believable in its own realm.  I've pounded my adversary round after round only for the AI to win and destroy all my cities in the last round.  This looks like an inadvertent cop-out from the designers that should be addressed.  The OM/physics needs work.  I've done OM related work before...we're familiar with heavenly bodies and gravitational fields.  The projected trajectory is a cool concept but we can predict with great accuracy where an object will go.  A civilization that can launch stuff as easily into orbit surely would have better OM capabilities as well (not eyeball it).  I get that the trajectory aiming is part of the game, but when my shots go awry...it doesn't give this player the ""hmm I didn't think of that.""  A few of my shots very closely mimicked the AI's trajectory.  The AI ended perfectly on target while mine was influenced by a mysterious force (note inadvertent cop-out statement).  IMHO, the game play needs more polishing to reach the ""intuitive controls"" level.  They aren't hard figure out, but there's no good explanation as to what does what and why it does it.  For example, there's no clear reason as to choose certain research projects in the tech tree.  Do they make a worthwhile difference?  How will the designers show this to the players in the upgrades to come?I'm content with this purchase.  But I'm an easy guy to please.  And if I'm merely content, I'm quite certain the majority of players are expecting that the ""best of Interplanetary is yet to come.""  I for one will be expecting that as well.  At this point, I recommend the game...with the cautionary wink and smile."

You build various weapons, power plants and defense grids on your planet, research tech, and sling missiles and railgun rounds at neighboring planets in an attempt to wipe out the competition. I tend to favor massive defense grids, which require huge amounts of energy, so I usually beeline for kinetic defense followed by nuclear power research. Then I build as many nuclear power plants and mines as my planet will hold and squeeze a lot of guns in throughout the network. My entire planet is secure, and I can safely fire at enemies. Others will take a more offensive apporach, immediately speccing into the weapons tree, and beeline for railgun and missile upgrades with intel mixed in to hammer foes into submission before they can even get off the ground. Both strategies have merit. But watch out for the superweapons! If you're taking an offensive approach, make sure you have the energy required to fire them. If taking a defensive approach, best to just build up massive amounts of counterintelligence (so people can't see structures on your planet)... because nothing can actually defend against a superweapon. Thankfully the last update let you place gamewide limits on how many of these can be build on both sides."

Especially if you're like me and you like playing LARGE games.The game has the planning of a turn based strategy mated to a guess-and-check skill system for taking your shots.  Evaluating your shots is fun at first, but a hundred rounds in, it gets rather annoying to still be stuck taking the same shots with the same spotty targetting.  Yes, your aim line gets drawn, but you still get stuck 'guessing' what your rounds are going to do as the planets orbit into your trajectories and gravity plays havoc.  Sorry guys, but NASA was solving that dillema when calculators were still the size of a Buick.The game could EASILY solve this by adding a tech field in the tech tree that allows you to see the predicted course of rounds to include future gravitational interactions, not just current ones.  It would definitely make pulling off crazy interplanetary (sic) slingshot trajectories more fun.    But it doesn't.  As such, the most important mechanic of the game, SHOOTING, gets annoying.A game like this straddles the line of fun and tedious.  It looks clever, but it can't hold my attention when I start zipping from round to round impatiently just trying to LAND a shot while my Turn-Based-Strategy segment suffers from inattention.  Once the RTS portion starts taking on problems because I'm rushing from turn to turn, the game spirals into an eventuall loss, resulting in frustration instead of enjoyment.I give this a soft downvote because of this.  Masochists might like this, but I'm disappointed.  It looks good.  It has a good soundtrack that feels epic and gets you in the mood to do battle, but I'm not a fan of frustrating tedium."
,Recommended,278910,9931606,"Posted: 25 April, 2014",all,NeutralDog,"Interplanetary is a turn based tank or Worms-like multiplayer artillery game, with the twist that you are a planet in orbit firing against other planets in your solar system. Be careful when you aim- shots that rely on the gravity of other celestial bodies may behave unpredictably when those objects are in motion! Shots bank and twist and slingshot around the sun and other planets. If you're not careful, you can even end up shooting yourself as the sun's gravity pulls your projectiles back towards your orbit!Half of the game is the fun of watching your shots wind crazily throughout the solar system, and the satisfaction of a well fired hit. The other half is resource management, weapon development and planet building. Each turn gives you an amount of resources and energy to spend based on the number of mines and power plants you've built. Shields in turn will protect your cities and buildings... but only to a degree. Do you build more weaponry, or do you use the energy you've accumulated in a turn to send another shot hurtling wildly across the solar system towards your enemy? Do you protect your city that has taken a number of shots already, or the power plants and weaponry necessary to fight back? And those technologies you've been researching throughout the game... eventually they will lead up to a MUCH more destructive arsenal.The game is solid, and is in a pretty decent place in its development. Currently it is most balanced with two players, but gets more and more insane as more players are added, so you can decide if you're in it for a genuine strategic experience or for a more casual playstyle that takes advantage of the multiplayer features and the ridiculousness of hurtling asteroids, missiles and lasers at your friends. Overall I think it can only get better as the developers add new content that will make each round more unique and satisfying."

However, even in it's current state, it's an excellent RISK or Monopoly style 'evening game' with friends, and hopefully will improve further in the future. For the price it's at, I strongly recomend it. And if you don't buy it, at least keep an eye on it.I'd like to get one thing out of the way right off the bat. This game is already one of my favorite games, and if they are able to improve on it from what they have here, and truly flesh out the mechanics and support, than this will be one of the best games of all time, hands down.However, right now, at this time, there are some problems with it, and you should be aware of them before you consider purchasing. First off, it is ONLY multiplayer right now, be it hotseat, lan, or online. Part of this is because the game is most certainly tailored for a multiplayer experience.Unfortunately, the game does not have a chat feature, nor a lobby feature, which means that playing the multiplayer is a bit lessened as an experience, unless you have another means of keeping in contact with your friends. Additionally, the Online servers are VERY unstable. Not everyone will be able to connect, and it's tough to determine who and where the connection problem is at.Aside from that, the game has very little explanation text, beyond the tutorial. The tech tree needs fleshing out, with a better description of how certain things behave, and what you can expect from them.Now for the positives.  Like a game of risk, this is a game best played by getting some buddies to sit down and play it out for an evening, forming alliances, backstabing eachother, bemoaning your losses and cheering your victories. And it certainly brings that feel one hundred percent. I've yet to be able to play a large game with my friends, but I look forward to when I get the chance to, and to see a truly dynamic swing of advantages."

Unless of course you have friends who have it... which is why getting the 4-pack seems to me like it would be the better buy, and gifting it to your friends to play it, because let's face it this game isn't really well known.Overall, I'd rate this game 7/10 just because there are many features missing, and until they're put in, I wouldn't recommend buying this game if you haven't been refered to it by a friend, because it's really all about the multiplayer."

76561198006880345,Recommended,278910,15821247,"Posted: 13 May, 2015",all,Beef Supreme,"Interplanetary is an easily overlooked indie game available on steam for around $10.  It is a turn-based strategy game with two phases. The first phase consists of a research and development turn during which players select technologies, build infrastructure, and place buildings on their planet. The second phase consists of players' weapon systems firing, and their trajectory estimates playing out. Each player controls the trajectory of their weapons which are acted upon by the gravity of celestial bodies within the solar system. The time period seems to be set in the near future, and the technology available reflects this appropriately. The single goal of this game is to enact planetary genocide against your rivals.The game feels somewhat like a match of Risk, in space, and with some basic grand-strategy elements, and ballistic physics.  Like Risk, players can expect to spend about one to five hours per game.  And like Risk, the game can get quite addictive, especially considering that it provides online multiplayer as well as local hotseat.  Hotseat allows multiple players to play the same game on the same pc together, and is an extremely underrated feature which is often left out of turn-based strategy games.There are a few things that I believe would add to the game.  For instance, the ability to colonize or conquer planets within the solar system, an “upgrade all” feature for buildings, the ability to name your planets and cities, and basic social, diplomatic, and political policies could add a great level of depth and immersion.Nevertheless, the gameplay is inviting.  Interplantary does not try to be something it is not. It remains simple enough to pick up and quickly get the hang of, short enough to play casually, and immersive enough to allow the imagination some stomping grounds. Overall, this game is definitely worth the asking price, especially if you like to have a few friends over for an afternoon of casual strategy and camaraderie. On sale for under $5, this title would be a steal in a steam-sale splurge."

I grabed it during a Sale and bought the 4pack, shared it among my friends and we soon started Annihilating each other. I try to keep it simple and compact.The Graphics:Nothing superb but not bad either. It does the job. There isnt much to show basicly. A few planets, a skybox, the Sun and then the few effects for shooting and hitting each other.Story:Not there. There is no Campaign or whatsoever. You can play vs the AI if you like but its kindah like the Worms AI. Not much fun imho. Stick to the Multiplayer and you´ll have some fun while shouting at each other.Gameplay:Very minimalistic basicly. You start with a planet with 5 cities, you then start building a couple of Mines and Powerplants. Then build teh guns and shoot at each other. If all of your cities are destroyed, you´re done for.You got some dumb projectiles that randomly disdributes the Hits on the planet and ofc, you got some Smart weapons like missiles where you set the Impact point on the Planet. Not to forget the Lasers, wich are somewhat super accurat but only can hit the side of the planet that is Facing to you.The Balance:As far as I´m aware, there wasnt a Single balance update since launch, only a few stability patches that where desperatly needed at Launch, but thats got nothing to do with the Balance.Some weapons feel Overpowered. In ""our"" first few rounds Laser became quickly popular, since they dont got a balistic flight. They hit instant in a straight line. Ofc there is a soft counter, to name them Shields, but if you aim them clever you can work around them. Same for basicly all Defensesystems. You only got a few weapons to choose from:-railgun, basic balistic gun-Missiles, advanced balistic weapon-Lasers, point and click weaponAnd the 2 ""superweapons""-Solarlaser, wich is basicly a Ray that is fired from the sun, not from your Planet and 1 hits basicly everything-Asteroid Diversion, a Load of clusterf*ck aimed at your opponents... and somethings coming back to youSo, including the superweapons you only got 5 different Weapons wich lets room for improvement. And since the Laserweapons are point and click, they are pretty much the strongest. Our group Disables them in most of our Games, because of Obvious Reasons.This game features a Techtree that is quite big but nonetheless allmost useless. We tried different tactics but straight rushing the Superweapons and going for Ecoboost tech afterwards, seems like the only competive way to play.Summit:I really enjoyed the Game so far BUT there are quite some things I would like to see adressed since the games is a bit expensive with 17€ without any discounts.The games doesnt feature an Observer Mode, wich means if you play with like 4-5 of your Bud´s and you´re out first, you sit there and wait for them to Finish since you cant watch them anymore.The tech and weapons needs rebalance, nothing big but little adjustments would be lovely. Like increasing the needed Techpower get the Superweapons. Be aware that the Game runs fine but still gets Server timeout errors once in a While. Around every 10th game or so.Do I recommend it?Yes, if you got some Friends to play it with and if it is on Sale.Thanks for Reading."

Interplanetary is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game which is about building up your own planet with cities, and trying to destroy your enemy.The game takes place in a single solar system with two civilized planets that are basically trying to destroy one another. On your own planet you can build cities with power plants and mines to collect resources. You can build defenses to shoot down an enemy incoming missile or a shield over your city to protect it. Also you can build weapons which shoot missiles or lasers to destroy the cities of your enemy. But beware! Have you ever heard of gravity? I bet you do, well you and your enemy are not the only planets floating around in this solar system. All planets have gravity, and it's your job to line up your shots correctly with the influence of gravity to hit your target. Well, these were just the basics...I like this game alot because the concept is so unique, i've never seen a game like this. Unfortunately there are not so many people online.

Unfortunately I never imagined it would be so SLOW.  I nearly fall asleep between game turn cycles with all AI.  Which is sad because I wanted to like this game so much that I put out 15 georges for it.  I really don't understand why the game cycle takes so long.  I'm running a Xeon E5 2.8ghz with 16 gb so it's not because of a shortage of compute power.  Surely it could have been designed to play faster especially when starting a new game.  Late game Civ5 cycles faster than this.  I now regret buying it because frankly the plodding gameplay is boring me on to other things.  For that reason I can't recommend it.

The server lobby is often empty and hosting a game takes quite a while most times as you wait for players to join.With that being said, if you don't mind waiting 10 minutes or so to fill an online game lobby, or you simply want to play LAN with a friend or family member, I think it's a really enjoyable experience all round with a very solid feel to the game.Your goal is to develop your planet in a relatively simple sense, then stick some guns onto it and take aim at your opponent's planets. It sounds easy, but considoring gravity pulls on all weapons, aiming can be very tricky at long ranges until you get the hang of it! But it's not a frustrating kind of tricky, it's the kind that makes you shout ""YEEEEAH!!!! WOO!"" when you get a hit and read the damage report.The game is turn based.Graphically this game is pretty sexy looking with a simple UI and good quality chat window.The community, atleast when you find other members of it, seem really great.

In the few games I did play I had loads of fun - making alliances against a common enemy only to betray them at the end. building mass drivers, missiles, lasers, asteroid diversion to completely wipe out enemy planets. I really enjoyed all that.Now the problems. while the game is incredibly fun its actually hard to start one. there is no Singleplayer mode (although the devs are developing it), trying to play randomly online will often greet you with an empty lobby (unless you bring in your friends) and even if you do you find a game, there will be issues with connection ranging from lag, to disconnections and outright refusal to connect. the game does however play wonderfully over LAN with friends.These issues make it nearly impossible to play the game you paid for, and are why I cant recommend this game for now. however the second these issues are fixed I wholeheartedly recommend you get this game."

I have never seen a multiplanet game that required trajectory planning to hit your target.Cons:That trajectory planning has no real way of calculating it, it's entirely by eye. This, combined with the wonky camera system, and the difficulty that makes to see the entire solar system at once makes it 20% skill, 80% luck, especially in a timed-term game.You experience everything the game has to offer in 20 minutes of playing, very few structures, no units,4 weapon types: Laser, Rail, Missile, and asteroid.

If I had known this, I would not have spent the money on it.  At the very minimum, this should have some sort of single-player tutorial mode, which is not currently included.  I was forced to play 'multi-player-hotseat' with no one technically assigned the second seat.  Since there is no AI for the second player, then it becomes a game where you are defeating yourself.    As to the game mechanics, it is a type of gravity sim, where you fire kinetic rocks at your openent, OR lasers once you have the tech, and your firing is adjusted according to gravitical effects for kinetic weapons, affected by all other planets in the solar system, and can be blocked for lasers by line of sight issues if there is the sun or other planets in the way.  Rules wise, it all makes sense, but as a single player game, this is a complete no go.  Sorry folks, if you don't have friends to stop by and take the 2nd seat, you have nothing to do.  If you DO have friends to switch out the hotseat mode, then you have the issue where your friend can see everything you are building even though they technically do not have the technology by game rules to do so... IE over the shoulder views of what you are doing when you are sitting in the hotseat."

Graphic is unnecessarily advanced, it's like playing Chess on Unreal engine.The two weapon choices, lasers and ballistics, get boring fast. Amount of buildings you need to stuff your planet with to get through a bigger game is staggering, with absolutely no micro-management help. Want to upgrade? It's click-it-all time. Piece by piece.And then there is the ridiculousness of orbital movement prediction not being somewhere in the tech tree. You can push an asteroid into a planet and build a freaking death ray next to a sun, and you have to guess the ballistics as if you are throwing rocks?Lastly, with all the simplicity, it takes miraculously long time for the AI to make their move and to simulate everything."

(Every single thing moving arround a solar system has gravity and WILL affect your weapons, unless its a laser, of course.)However i find it hard to find a match lastly, there isnt many people playing that i can find (Maybe has something to do with my GMT-3 Timezone from south america wich is not a very big online-gaming part of the world), so if you have someone to play this game is just fantastic, and the local multiplayer certainly works like a charm if a friend comes over.

76561197986955769,Recommended,278910,19684731,"Posted: 13 December, 2015",all,Bloody Spy!,"AN EXCELLENT ARTILLERY SPACE GAMEI’ve been a fan of artillery games for many many years. I’ve played most of the Worms games and loved them (most of them), and I loved playing a game called Tanks way back in the early 90s. Yes I’m old. I had to break out of the retirement home just to write this review for you guys so please give it a thumbs up.Anyway, Interplanetary differs from all of the other artillery games I’ve played in that the developers have taken the genre into outer space. Boy does it work wonderfully in this new playground! Because planets are continually orbiting their host stars you have to predict where you think the enemy planet will be by the time your projectile will have reached it after having traversed the star system - very much like leading a target with a sniper rifle in a first-person shooter game.Not only do you have to take into account the movement of your target planet as it performs its orbit, you also have to consider the movement of other orbiting bodies, their gravity wells, and the fact that they may move in to the way of your otherwise well-aimed shot. I’ve often been saved from the onslaught of incoming enemy fire by an uninhabited planet “heroically” diving in the way to bear the full brunt of the barrage. Thank you, physics! :DMoreover, you have to take into consideration the rotation of your planet and that of the target planet too. If you’ve built a laser and it’s on the opposite side of your planet facing away from the enemy then it’ll be completely useless for that targeting turn until your planet has rotated to face the correct direction. Likewise, if you’re aiming for a particular enemy city and it’s currently on the opposite side of the planet, from your point of view, then it’ll make it a lot more difficult to hit, and you may even have to wait until the planet’s rotation has put it on the side that’s facing you to score a successful attack.Very basically, in each turn you can build, undertake research, and shoot at your enemies. You have to plan this carefully because firing lots of weapons in one turn may not leave you with any energy remaining to begin contruction projects that round. This is true the other way around: too much building and you'll have no energy left to fire your weapons. So it's best to go on the offensive when you've got easy shots lined up, and build up your planet when the targets are far away and with lots of celestial bodies obstructing the path.You then win the game by destroying all of the enemy's cities and massacring the millions of civilians who, hitherto, inhabited it.PROS- Single player and multiplayer with up to 7 enemies in both cases. This can provide some very interesting and challenging matches, especially when one player's shot misses the intended target and hits someone else instead :D- Buildings and cities are upgradeable e.g. power plants can produce even more energy, satellite arrays have improved detection of enemy structures, HP increase...- Weapons are upgradeable e.g. increased damage, reduced power consumption,- Lots of great upgrades to research and unlock via the tech tree.- Great orchestral soundtrack that adds wonderfully to the atmosphere.- Firing a shot around the sun only to have it slung-shot back in your direction, hit your own planet, and destroy your own buildings is surprisingly good fun. There’s even a Steam achievement if you manage to do that! :DCONS- Relatively few weapons: rain gun, missile, laser, solar laser, asteroid diversion... That’s it, sadly.- The computer AI has pretty much perfect aim. In my experience the AI shots almost never miss.- All of the matches are played in just unary star systems (i.e. just one sun). I know it would make aiming interplanetary projectiles a lot more difficult in binary or ternary solar systems (2 or 3 stars respectively), what with all of the extra gravity wells, but it would be a great challenge for those who want a ‘hardcore’ game mode.- (as an extension of the last point) All of the host stars are just main sequence stars like our Sun. It would have been great to have had different star types like blue super giants and white dwarfs. With their differing sizes (and different mass) firing projectiles through the planetary system would require very different trajectories and velocities with such different stars. Also, their very different masses, and therfore gravity, would greatly affect the angular velocities of the orbiting planets - another factor that would influence how you’d have to plan your trajectory paths during the targeting phase.I’d easily give Interplanetary an 8 or 8.5 out of 10. It would instantly get an extra point if the developer added the “missing content” outlined in my cons section.If you like turn-based strategy games, with excellent artillery action which requires precise planning, and also involves base building with research then Interplanetary should be an insta-buy for you.As always, leave any questions below and I’ll get back to you.Happy mass-murdering!"

,Recommended,278910,9942582,"Posted: 26 April, 2014",all,misterbob,"This is a promising game with what's currently on offer, considering it's still early access. It's very pretty and the combat mechanics are a lot of fun, trying to aim rockets to curve around other objects in the solar system makes it a lot more entertaining than selecting a target and firing.The development of planets is pretty simple with only about 10 different types of buildings you can build. This is both a blessing and a curse; it makes the game easy to pick up and I was fairly familiar to the mechanics within a few hours, but of course for people who playa  lot of strategy games it might be overly simple. Most things currently in the game seem well balanced, with the possible exception of the ""super weapons"". They seem rather overpowered and from my experience, most rounds just end up as a race to be the first to get one.My online experience hasn't been great so far, I'm yet to complete a game online due to various issues with the game itself as well as people just dropping out of games. It's really disappointing because there is a lot of potential that isn't being found there yet. The non-online ""hotseat"" mode is a lot of fun as it stands and with private online matches or some sort of system to stop people dropping out (possibly reputation depending on how many games you finish?), the online multiplayer could be great too.There's no single player as it stands, but this is of course planned and could be really solid too, as long as the AI are up to scratch.In short, this game is good as it currently is, but I see the potential for it to be great, and at this price, who could argue with that?"

I got to say this about Interplanetary: It is a very strategic game. You spend a lot of time pondering your next move, the tech tree is deep but not that deep, making your choices of tech dictate your strategy. Do you run gun spam? Get missles? Run for a super weapon... etc. Every turn your choices have a long term impact on your future, choose wisely. Its by far not a 'super' complex game, but its better that way. The amount of choices available allow make it not some wildely varying battle but a game of the mind. The price is right, not to expensive, and the game has supprising depth for something so viscerally appealing (you can't say the idea of bombarding your fellow planets doesn't appeal to you.)

On normal, the next difficulty up, they seem to know EXACTLY where to shoot to hit you. Out of ~30 projectiles fired at me, ~8 missed. You, however, don't have this knowledge. and unless you're using lasers, will suffer pretty badly.EDIT: Having played it once again, it's too far on the other side, now. The AI on easy is TOO accurate and seem to target you far more readily than other players. That or I'm horribly unlucky."

It looks polished and has a very nice (AND THREATENING) weapons system, a tech tree that can be built upon, super weapons, and some very nice physics implemented.The single player can be pretty fun, but in the end you know the bots are just missing on purpose.

Less ""Worms"" and more ""Scorched Earth"" with some strategic building mixed in. Online play is where the game shines, although curiously online AI players are not yet supported.I would like to see a few additions/changes made, if possible.1) Persistent projectiles: Currently, if projectiles miss their targets, they explode before the next round starts. It would be nice if they remained until they hit something. This would add some much needed chaos and open up the possibility of new strategy elements (flood the solar system with cheap railgun slugs and hope for the best!).2) Balance for orbit positions: Some may disagree, but the players on the outer orbits are definitely at an advantage. Players on the inner orbits are guaranteed to get chewed up first, and the outer rim planets are free to build up and attain superweapons. Perhaps the method of balancing this would be my third suggestion...3) Planet speed: It seems that all of the planets move at the same speed, but the outer ones should move slower. This would make them easier to hit, perhaps?The developer seems to be actively updating the game, so hopefully they can consider these suggestions. All in all though, an amazing game!

To win you have to eliminate your opponents cities, and in a few multiplayer games I've had opponents yelling ''i sunk your battleship'' ... which continues to make me smile.2) it is very simple to pick up, as the general mechanics and the buildings should make sense to you very quickly, and games are also relatively quick, so it's great for short bursts of fun - though mastering the game is not easy. There is also no story or general context, or diplomacy, other than to 'sink' those cities. That sounds bad but it is not, it is refreshing and the game excels at providing focused strategic fun.3) it is satisfying - hitting an opponent on a near impossible shot, or having your planet just escape a major hit ... it just feels good.Con's:1) not much information feedback from the game. it would be nice to know how much damage I did, or how many shots got through, or, well, anything really ... there is also no information at the end of the game either. I guess I could just be spoilt by other games, as this does not detract from the enjoyment or mechanics. However, even though I can understand that limited information is best at the end of each turn (that the intelligence system should give you what you need), there could be something at the very end (even a simplistic score based on damage or population or something).2) a bit buggy, had a few crashes here and there and the AI takes a while to make a turn.3) no quick save feature (as far as I can tell). Given the occasional crashes it is useful to save after each turn, which means going into the menu each time and selecting a save ... not a hassle you say? It gets really annoying after a while.Overall: just buy it and love it. My hopes are this game will continue to get developed, as I would love to see a few extra buildings, a bigger tech tree and all new features. It is addictive fun :)p.s: though the game is best played with other people, the AI seems fine to me. I've only played on easy and normal but the AI seems to generally hit well enough and miss well enough on both of those settings ... the AI is not obviously overpowered or underpowered to me, though they don't really use telescopes to spy on the player much."

You get in with no idea and build a solar plant with 2 mines, after a bring turn you build a rail gun and more mines maybe with a kenetic defence notice you have researched two techs. After this you fire at the enemy and miss then go on to build more guns and fire them later. After a while you think the AI has no chance since you have lasers early game. You hit next turn and the AI happens to have both super weapons and 15 railguns combine with 6 rockets and lasers. All hit with pin point accuracy and you have just been destroyed in one turn. But the multiplayer is where everyone is just barely hanging on. Their buildings are been constantly rebuilt and by the end only two remain with one last hope, only one wins. Buy this game now.

The mechanics are very unique and there's never been a game quite like it. Interplanetary is one of a kind. It combines gravity and lasers/guns which requires you to have some skill at knowing how to aim them. As I said before, it's in early access but so far the features it has are very proming."

While it is still in alpha, its a very impressive style of RTS that's much more relaxing than others I've encounterd. Like another reviewer said, it feels like a game, not a job.As for some improvements that could be made, other ""maps"" (for lack of a better term) could be made, with elliptical orbits, larger neutral planets (with increased gravity), a second sun to orbit, or a black hole just as a couple examples.AI is pretty difficult to fight against. I'm pretty sure on turn 3 they have enough railguns to destroy every other planet in the solar system, while my planet is just building up some mines.There isn't a huge player base, so multiplayer is kinda hard to come by, but whenever you play with a large amount of people, the outermost planet tends to win since its somewhat harder to shoot them from the innermost planets. Eliptical orbits could put everyone on equal footing.Also, railgun op. Devs, a railgun shoots a single bullet, not a shotgun shell, plz nerf."

On the one hand, it is an interesting game, it's certainly unique, it's fun to play, and kept me occupied for a bunch of hours. But it's so frustratingly shallow! There's no diplomacy, so no reason not to attack absolutely everyone all the time. So combat isn't a strategic choice, it's just something you do, and something other people do to you.There's no way to plan movement (your planet just always goes around the sun), so there's really no need for forward planning, or to watch what others are doing and react. The only interesting choices are in which buildings to construct, and if other people happen to blow your bases up along the way, you cope with it. And once you've figured out your favourite tech tree and building progression, you just do that every time.It's a shame, because it's all built on a solid foundation and an interesting mechanic - it just feels like it needs more depth."
