GA, at it's core, is an arcade game. There are 3 weapons and 3 sub-weapons and that's it. No other mech customization that  I can find.The controls are decent but not super tight and there is no mouse support. The resolution is pretty small and the window in Windowed mode is tiny at 1920x1080. The Story just seems to be the same as arcade but with a wall of text before the level. This is much closer to the NES games it claims influence from than Front Mission: Gun Hazard... which is one of my favorite 2D games of all time.With all that said, I still think GA is fun. It's just not deep. The sprites are cool, the 6 guns are quite different, the bosses are huge... It's worth your time, just probably not going to last for a ton of it."

A few key differences are in how the game controls: unlike Cybernator, while you hold down the fire button your aiming is locked.  Might be an improvement, but it's up to you.  The ""dash"" move is just a short dash forward, rather than a continuous smooth glide on robo-skates.  That aside, this ought to feel familiar if you're fond of the mech action platformers on the SNES.  I would say most of those games (Metal Warriors, Front Mission: Gun Hazard, etc.) are better and deeper than this, but Giant Army is a fine homage with some slick pixel art and nicely animated sprites."
76561198055709474,Not Recommended,278930,14465597,"Posted: 14 February, 2015",all,Tonyu,"Gigantic Army is a sidescrolling mecha shooter similar to the likes of the Assault Suit series and Front Mission Gun Hazard.  Though I did enjoy some aspects of this game, and I really would want to like this game as a mecha fanatic, I just can't recommend it due to some bad game mechanics:1) TIME LIMIT - You control a slow moving mech and you start off with little time. The ONLY way to add time is to find containers with T powerups around the stage, but you're not encouraged to explore since you already start off with little time. Enemies don't even drop powerups, so if you took too long against that sub-boss and took too much damage well then good luck with the rest of the stage.2) NO CHECKPOINTS - When you die, you only have 3 continues. And when you continue, you start at the way back at beginning of the stage.3) DAMAGE CARRIES OVER THE NEXT STAGE - Although you do get healed at the end of a stage, the amount of healing however depends on your score. So not only do you need to watch out for the time, you're also going to worry about taking as little damage as possible while worrying about killing as much enemies as possible to increase your score and increase your healing for the next stage.4) MOVEMENT PROBLEMS - Yes I know you're controlling a mech, so it makes sense it moves slow. But in Gigantic Army's case, it's a bit too slow because of the time limit. You can dash, but it's very short and it's inputted via tapping forward twice that doesn't respond well. And no, there's no dash hotkey. There's no double-jump, but instead there's a booster to let you fly for a few seconds as long as you have fuel. Fuel regenerates quickly, but its tank capacity could be higher. Some platforms can't be reached unless you have a full tank, which means you'll have to wait for a while for it to fill up before you jump. If you make a mistake and failed to reach a platform, you'll fall and have to wait for the fuel tank to replenish before you try again so that's precious seconds wasted. And finally there's no ""jump down"" from platforms. So if you see some powerup boxes below a platform, you'll have to walk all the way to the edge to fall down then walk underneath the platform. And it sucks if those boxes didn't have any Time powerups, so that's time wasted.5) CANNOT CHANGE WEAPONS IN BETWEEN MISSIONS - When you start a game, you get to select 1 main weapon out of 3, and 1 special weapon out of 3. That's the only time you get to select a weapon. It could have been nice if it was like some space shooters that allow you to change weapons after a mission.6) SPECIAL WEAPONS HAVE LIMITED AMMO - You get to chose among 3 back weapons: Cluster Bomb with 12 ammo, Missile Barrage with 6 ammo, and a Beam Cannon with 2. Unfortunately you cannot pickup ammo for them, so you'll have to save them for bosses or large enemies. And if you miss, too bad. They do replenish at the beginning of the mission though.Like I said I really would want to like this game, but these game mechanic problems just prevent me from doing so."

I'm shooting for a 1CC so I'm denying myself continues and am getting about half-way through level 4 on Normal mode.  Given that I've only put ~2 hours in to it this game appears pretty easy for a shooter but I've still got two difficulty levels to unlock and get smacked by and if the game is anything like Satazius the differences in difficulty levels should be pretty extreme (Satazius has extra bosses for example).  The mechanics are rock solid and the control is tight.  Music is ok but nothing to write home about and the game isn't exactly overflowing with extras but you get the main game, four difficulty levels, a practice mode to refine your skills, and 3 main weapon choices along with 3 subweapon choices.  If you, like me, decide to shoot for a 1CC and work your way through the ranks the game will probably give you about ~200 hours of gameplay but if you, like so many others, credit feed (you are locked in to the starting credit plus 3 extras and I'm unsure if there is a way to add more) and then plan on whining about the games length you won't have a good time but this game wasn't made for the latter anyways.  Shmup fans rejoice, 7.5/10 (Rating primarily determined by fun factor with a 10 being Battle Garegga, Rayforce, or Raiden DX and a 1 being any of the Exceed games or Sol Divide)Edit: I must not have been in the zone earlier and I was certainly out of my element playing on my 10 inch Asus T100 tablet with the docked keyboard but when I jumped on my desktop with my 360 controller in hand I dominated.  Then, I further dominated when I tried the one primary weapon I had yet to test, the grenade one, which happens to be way overpowered.  Now, being overpowered isn't a bad thing necessarily for two reasons: 1. I'd prefer the game to be built with one weapon in mind, the selection was actually an annoyance for me so from now on, unless I want to intentionally increase the difficulty, I'll just use my setup and not give the setup screen a second thought;  and 2. these games tend to be considered very difficult so perhaps me finding the game easier will be a plus for many out there who are unfamiliar with run and guns or simply want a more accessible one.  But, I still feel the edit is necessary because these changes drastically affect my estimated play time which I will attempt to update with concrete fact as I approach my 1CC's.  I plan on not editing the original posted body of the review in order to maintain a standard of accuracy and provide full disclosure of any mistakes that I may have made.Edit 2: I finished my 1CC of Normal after about two hours of play that amounted to maybe six attempts.  I find that to be way too easy for my liking but I'll still move on to Hard next and give it a go.  My all clear was done with the Grenade Launcher and the Missiles (whichever the middle option is) for a score of 4,738,644 which I've posted to the Community Hub."

It’s a bit frustrating when you have to spend a minute getting yourself killed so you can quit.Next is the fact that you are timed. Now I know its ok with some other games, like metal slug 3 (a great game by the way) but in this your mech is very slow and having a time limit doesn’t really mix. Also they have a time booster that adds 1 second.I really don't see the point of this as you probably used 3 seconds collecting it.Next are the controls (note I’m reviewing these based on using a 360 pad/controller) which are bindable but not to every button. For example I wanted to set the shoot function to the left trigger but it just did not work. It also does a pretty bad job at telling you what stuff does, like how instead of saying shoot, jump etc. it just says button 1, button 2 and so on.Another thing that's done a bit poorly is, that there is no saving your game. Or if there ever was a way, the game doesn’t tell you about it. And if you can't save, you’re going to have to beat the whole game in one go.Also, judging by the steam page the game is not that long at all, as I beat 2 levels out of 6 in 6 or 8 minutes. I know this because of the timer counting down.So in the end, even though I enjoyed it, I am not recommending it , as steam has waay cheaper games that are more fun, longer and better in my opinion(since it’s an opinion, feel free to make up your own mind, if you buy the game). And even though I got over the game’s faults, I think a lot of people will just get way too frustrated to make it worthwhile. And that's the review."

If you enjoy the aesthetic of franchises such as Armored Trooper VOTOMS or Front Mission, then you'll love this game. Balls to the wall, side-scrolling action featuring some absurdly large, and very fun, bosses. The only criticisms are that if you're accustomed to side-scrolling games, you'll probably find this to be a little bit too easy, and that it's perhaps a little bit too barebones. However, you shouldn't let that stand in the way of enjoying such a cheap game."

I went into this game wanting to play something like Target Earth or Assault Suits Leynos as it is also called but this is what I got instead.Let me start with the least offenseive issue. The sound design is pretty bad, There is no audio in the ""story"" bits, the main menu or company screens. UI lacks some sounds as well.The game has bad visual design for everything but the main robot you play, the partical effects and the explosions. The robots you fight are badly animated look muddled and not very good. In story bits texts falls out of the device and is unreadable.The biggest problem is it is designed poorly. The enemies are unagressive and weak. You COULD beat the game easily if you took your time. The only real threat to you is the time limit. The time limit is strict and makes you rush the level making mistakes. So rather then actually designing enemies or bodded to be hard; they used a clock to create artifical difficulty.The weapons are unbalanced. The only weapons you should use are the cluster bomb(if you hit the enemy with all of it it does the equal of two beam cannon shots and you get 12 of these compaired to 2 laser cannon shots)This game feels like an early beta and needs a LOT of work and it IS NOT an early acess game. Don't waste your money on this."

Unfortunatly it doesn't really live up to some of my favorites like Metal Warriors, and Cybernator since the controls seem a bit clunky. The 'robo-skates' is only a quick dash move instead of a smooth glide, you can't change your angle of fire unless you stop shooting (which makes it nearly useless against moving targets), and some of the weapons (both regular, and special) are pretty worthless.All that having been said, I do like the graphics, chip-tune soundtrack, and how smooth most of the animations are. The melee attack is interesting in that it auto-activates when something is near enough to be hit, and the gauges showing health, shield health, and your jumpjet fuel are all well placed. I think I will try waiting a bit to see if they smooth this out a bit more in the near future and go from there."
,Recommended,278930,24095489,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Helios Leinheart,"You have to set your expectations accordingly when it comes to mecha sidescrollers like this. Do you have the speed and dexterity of Mario? No. You're a giant mech suit, and thus you move as such. If you work with what the game gives you and give it a chance, I'll think you'll find a pretty satisfying experience.Basic movement is slow, but there is a dash function that is vital if you want to get a huge time bonus added to your score at the end of a stage. I do have a couple complaints about the dash function though. Dashing is done by double tapping in a direction, and cannot be mapped to a button for easier activation. You also dash in short bursts, instead of continuing until you cancel it. Meaning you'll often be double tapping right in rapid succession to get through long stretches of land faster. There's also no sense of inertia when you dash off of a ledge or when you dash and jump. All of that extra forward momentum that you should be experiencing just gets dumped and you fall back to base movement speed.Mowing down enemies in your path is very satisfying with the weapons provided here. There's a nice trade off when it comes to choosing your primary and sub weapons. Choosing a weak primary gun will give you more uses with your sub weapon, and vice versa. It takes a long time to destroy a boss with just the machine gun, but you can choose the incredibly satisfying laser cannon as your sub weapon and wreck their life bars in a matter of seconds. And while health doesn't fully regenerate between stages, your sub weapon uses do. Allowing you to strategically hold on to your sub weapon uses until the last boss of the stage and then dumping them all. There's also the pile bunker, which is a melee punch that automatically occurs when you try firing your weapon at close range to an enemy. Some bosses can be quickly dispatched with this daring strategy as well.While the mechs looks decent enough, the levels are extremely bland looking. As for the music, considering the context of the game here (shooting up hordes of mechs), this has got to be the most bizarrely subdued soundtracks I've ever heard. The tunes aren't bad, but I couldn't hum one for you if I tried. Both because they're barely audible, and because they're just not the pulse pounding tracks that you would expect in a game like this. Hell, the track that plays in the last stage of easy or normal mode sounds like something you would hear when you're spelunking for treasure in caves or something.Just a couple funny little quirks I've noticed, there are achievements for getting hit by a shock floor and for running into a mine, but no achievements for avoiding them. I've also had a strange issue with getting the game to remember my gamepad button mapping. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. It's not particularly annoying to go in and set it up the way I like, it's just a minor quirk.Considering I bought this game during a summer sale for only $2.99, I find it pretty satisfying for my money. As for full price, I'm not so sure. The amount of content is relatively small. You'll primarily find the most enjoyment in racking up your score and trying like hell to beat hard mode without any continues so you can see the true final level and boss."

It may not be the most original, but it has the heart and soul of Cybernator, metal Suit Valken, and all those older games, and you can tell they really put effort into making this game a fine experience. Would gladly recommend. Although I don't like how short it is. However, that's something to expect from Astro Port titles. Amazing gameplay, but a little short, like a half hour to an hour if you're not rushing. But Harder difficulties give you more replayability, so there's that."

76561198094391041,Recommended,278930,9504481,"Posted: 16 March, 2014",all,Rival_M,"I have Satazius, so when I saw that Astro Port and Nyu Media were releasing another game, and claiming that it took up the mantle of old-school games like Cybernator, Metal Warriors, and Front Mission:  Gun Hazard, I was very excited.  I played a lot of Cybernator and Metal Warriors back in the day on my SNES, and those two rank up there as some of my most favorite games.  I played Gun Hazard when I discovered emulation in the late 90s (I had previously played through Front Mission 3 for the PS1).  I tried Assault Suits Leynos (Target Earth in the US) on a Genesis emulator once, but couldn't really get into it.Simply put, this game delivers, especially for the price point.  I don't think I'd pay ten bucks for it unless it had more content, but at six, it's just right.  And a Steam sale would make it even more attractive.  You get exactly what it says on the box - old-school mecha blasting action that scratches that 16-bit itch.  It just doesn't do anything to innovate or move the genre forward in any meaningful way.  But that's OK because hey, bargain bin entertainment.The action is non-stop.  This is partly due to a timer, which forces the player to move forward or risk losing the mission.  But there are also ""reinforcements.""  Enemies might respawn forever, but it's not worth finding out as time continually is running out.Players choose one of three primary weapons, and one of three special weapons.  The primary weapons feature five upgradable power levels and unlimited ammo.  The secondary weapons are ammo limited based on the primary weapon.  So for instance, if one chooses the assault rifle primary and the beam cannon secondary, there will be three shots of the beam cannon.  If one picks the grenade launcher primary, the beam cannon will only have one shot.  I found this balances the weapons rather nicely, and was pleasantly surprised it was balanced so well, given that there only appear to be two people invovled in making the game, with maybe two additional play testers.  There is no one ""best"" option, as all choices seem to be suited to particular styles of play.  I've found, for instance, that the shotgun and missile pack are the easiest for me to use.  The downside is the player is stuck with one loadout for the entire game.  It would've been nice to switch it up between missions.The graphics look nice and fit with the 16-bit aesthetic the team was going for.  I think in this day and age the explosions could look a little less like they were cut-and-pasted from an explosion generator app, but they get the job done.  The backgrounds are especially well done, with the first few levels even having some cool battles happening in them.  Some of the enemies do look a little rough, though, as if the artist was rushed and didn't have as much time to polish them as much as others.  As a result there are times where the graphics do not look coherent, and it can be rather unsettling.  I noticed this in Satazius, too.  I also am not a fan of animating the sprites using rotation, rather than an actual animation sheet.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just looks strange to me, almost like really bad CGI in low-budget SyFy Channel movies.  I understand why the developers do it this way, I just wish they had the resources to build traditional animations.  The game would look so much better.The sound effects are a mixed bag as well.  Most of them are well done and fit with the aesthetic, however there are some sound effects that seem really out of place and tend to break the coherence of the aesthetic.  The music, on the other hand, is great.  It's energetic without being overwhelming.  It blends in well with most of the sound effects and never seems to swell out of control or get annoying.  It's a little more advanced than the standard MIDI-type music of the SNES, but I'll let that slide as it does such a great job of setting the mood in each stage.Controls are very reminiscent of Cybernator.  They are fairly easy to learn, but like that game it takes some time to master them.  The character responds well to input and even though there is some clunkiness built in to help simulate moving a large hunk of metal, it is still easy to get around the enviroment, dodge bullets, and maneuver around enemies.  The only real complaint I have is the double-tap to dash mechanic.  This seems like a terrible move on the part of Astro Port, considering Cybernator and Metal Warriors both used one of the face buttons to activate the dash.  Given that there are only six actions (fire, jump, shield, switch weapons, pause, and screenshot), and modern controllers have plenty of buttons, they certainly could've put the dash on a button.  I don't like it when basic controls involve some kind of skill.  The double tap is kind of finicky and difficult to time correctly, and almost impossible with the analog stick.  If they do a sequel, I hope they fix that.The length of the game is just right.  Once you get good at it, it takes a little over a half hour to 1CC the game.  I know we live in the age where everything is supposed to take 40-60 hours to complete, but as a dad with two kids, I just don't have that kind of time anymore.  Sometimes I just want to sit down and blow stuff up for a few minutes after dinner.  The old 16-bit games were all like that anyway.  Plus for six bucks, you shouldn't be expecting Final Fantasy-length engagements anyway.Like Satazius, there are four difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane), with Hard and Insane being unlocked upon completion of Normal and Hard, respectively.  The difficulty ramps up nicely, with enemies firing more aggressively and environmental hazards increasing.  I never felt like it was unfair or overly difficult.  Careful and skillful gaming will get one through, as well as choosing the weapon loadout that works best for your playstyle.Overall I really like this game.  I like Satazius, too, and I hope Astro Port continues to make these great homages to the classic 16-bit era.  I would even be willing to pay more, say $10-$15, if they would incorporate some modern touches like unlockable extras, more weapon choices, longer stages, maybe a progression system, and alternate endings.  I mean even the old school games tended to change the ending based on difficulty.  If you're fan of the old school, especially the 16-bit era games, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.  I don't think you'll be disappointed."

At it's core, it's a 16 bit inspired shoot em up that looks decent, plays decent, and does everything well enough that I enjoy playing it.  But the real issues are more technical than anything:The game either runs as an incredibly small window, or an oversized full screen that cuts off portions of the screen (running on a 1080p display).  There aren't any options to change this, so you're either missing parts of the game or squinting to see everything well enough.  The controls work well enough, though firing seems to be locked at weirdly specific angles, rather than allowing any direction, and you can't adjust it while firing.The difficulty is done well, however the one thing that threatens to ruin the game are the insane time limits.  Even with multiple drops to boost it, you'll still wind up dying solely because of the timer.  Combined with the fact that you move incredibly slow and have relatively underpowered weapons, it becomes fairly annoying, specifically during boss fights.  At the very least, a 0 time limited doesn't immediately end the game, but rather strips your health with each second over.Given that it's fairly cheap, I can deal with it, as it still has the potential to be fun."

The designs of the various grainy enemies in particular are a highlight, with the level 2 boss being my personal favourite. The sound is also to be conmmended- though unfortunately no so much the music, which is extremely forgettable. Just turn it down and enjoy the rich, crunching sounds of the pile-bunker, or the heavy explosions because you'll be hearing alot of both.A few criticisms, however. Firstly, the game is extremely tough. Though this isn't an issue in itself, combined with a limit of three continues, and an absolutely brutal timer, lots of people won't be seeing the final levels. As fore-mentioned, the music is incredibly dull, which is unfortunate considering the standards of Cybernator's incredible OST.

They say they're paying tribute to Cybernator and Front Mission: Gun Hazard, and they deliver with all the new-gen hit detection, framerate, and lush backgrounds you couldn't get back in 16-bit. Be warned, though; that hit detection works both ways. There are bosses who will shoot at you from multiple directions, hitting you regardless of your blocking. From hard mode onward there are areas where you will rely on your shield so heavily that it will break, and you will mourn its passing. That being said, there are two pixel boss dodges and quick blocks where you will feel like you're owning the battlefield....until you play hard mode, where you will cling to health drops like your mother's teat. You will painstakingly ask yourself if it's worth it to spend an irreplaceable special shot on a mid level boss with the main boss around the corner and your health precariously low.But really the difficulty is very well balanced. There are enemy design decisions that seem forehead slappingly easy which become deviously difficult on the higher difficulties. Even little things like level traps and boss patterns scale with difficulty. The pacing on normal was such that I squeaked by the last boss with a last ditch melee attack for the no-continues-used-win while I myself was a hair from death. Thankfully, there is a ONE BUTTON return to menu function, and the intro is about 3 seconds long when you spam the skip button. You will be glad you have this if you're going for the ""beat one mission without getting hit"" achievement from normal difficulty upwards.Cons: lack of resolution options, game doesn't recognize gamepad unless it's active when you start the app, game wants to recognize analog stick (which you won't want to use) including switching over to analog only if you accidentally nudge  it in a firefight and frantically try to figure out why you are not aiming properly anymore. I also think the options for one button dash and one button melee would be welcome (being that I have so many buttons on this 360 controller), but all in all these are very minor complaints. The main con is that I wanted it to be longer, which is also really just indicative of the game's quality.TLDR: I got it for three dollars. Pew pew 5 hours of fun with some rewarding moments.

It also has giant robots, and if that isn't a selling point to you, you're a communist.I do have a handful of problems with it, though.

This game runs in no higher than 480p, so you better pull out your CRT monitor because you're gonna be seeing some scan lines for sure. It's not only 480p, but it's 640X480 which is 4:3 ratio. Yeah, it's hardcore. Checkpoints? Won't find those here. You die, you go back to the beginning of the stage with your weapons dialed back to wimpy. 3 continues.....that's it. Use them all and it's a real ""game over"". However the developers seem to have mastered the art of making a game challenging, but amazingly fun. Even if you use all your continues and have to start over, you will have fun getting back to the place where you died. This game has more style than most throwbacks and also has killer game play than most throwbacks lack.I omitted the story at the beginning and in between levels because they're a pretty long read and there is no music to enjoy while reading. I won't lie, I made it about half way through the reading and just started skipping it because it really breaks the flow of the game. The story reading is WAY too long and boring along with having a TON of spelling and grammar errors. It really looks like the story was just thrown in at the last minute. Here is the actual story: You're a mech, and you shoot everything that moves! Gigantic Army is often compared to Cybernator or Metal Warriors on the SNES, but Gigantic Army is much faster pace. So much so that you have a time limit, which you must boost by picking up the time extenders. This was jarring at first as the first few times I played this game I died because I ran out of time. This is not a game where you want to hang around and shoot everything or backtrack like you do in Cybernator. You need to keep moving or you will not have enough time to fight bosses. Honestly once you learn to pick up the pace you won't even notice the time limit, and the fast pace keeps you on your toes. Other than that the game is very satisfying with it's excellent sound design, music, and glorious explosions. The game is very short, but you do unlock more difficulties when you beat the game which does put up a much better challenge than the first time around. This game is not very deep so leave your brain at the door and shoot things.I love the graphics in this game because they didn't go for the ultra smooth and cartoony look that modern raster graphics provide. Instead they chose the grit that you can only get from 16 bit color pallets and sprites. The game is not overly colorful or elaborate. Much like Shovel Knight, the developers seemed to have gone for a more authentic look from a time where there were actually hardware limitations. Though this game is nothing even close to the production values and excellence of Shovel Knight, it is still good cheap fun. The game normally sells for 6 bucks and goes on sale on every Steam sale for 3 bucks. No matter what price you pay you won't be disappointed."

In a very good way too though, and i actually prefer Gigantic Army for its lack of dialogue scenes that you don't care about anyway, as well as its much superior visual style-- you fight huge things that look like huge things, lots of nice little details, and some of the backgrounds are really impressive too. I just love how everything looks, basically. Even if you just like the whole Heavy Gear-style mech aesthetic with camera heads and wheeled feet and big gunz then this is definitely worth playing. Game of The Year for Cybernator fans, in whatever year you happen to play it."

Movement is a bit sluggish but it's still fun to make things go BOOM even if you do lumber a bit. Sound is good. Sprite work is good. There's a story but the creator allowed a fast forward feature just by holding the button down. The game also has that hard but fair difficulty. I was only able to beat the game on easy. And even then, it took me a few tries.If you're into 16-bit mech shooter goodness, Gigantic Army is a solid title.9/10"
