Lots of fun, a great game so far!I had a problem with the mouse and video sync and received fast and friendly support which in the end we were able to resovle. The issue was not with the game but the display scaling in Windows.Now for the game...So I got to play some and the next thing I know its a few hours later and I'm level 10. Excellent game so far. I like the look of the game but then again I'm an old school cRPG player who grew up on Ultima I-V so I love these tiled games. 9th Dawn II does a GREAT job of keeping that old school aka Ultima-like look and feel, but with all new and modern improvements to pretty much the entire concept. Many games like this have limited upgrades in the form of equipment and such, not 9th Dawn II. Lots of items to find and or purchase in various shops, lots of little things that as of my current time in the game don't seem to be part of the main or any side plots, but just the same they are there and fun to explore. If you like exploring the unknown to find treasure, monsters, and of course ancient caves and dungeons then you'll love this game. The main plot so far is pretty good, but I really haven't played enough to see much of it, although I saw the word Hydra during a NPC conversation and sooo hope there are Hydras or is it Hydrae ;) in the game as they are my favorite fantasy beast.Anyhow, let me sum this up. So far so GREAT! Lots of fun, can't wait to play some multiplayer with my brother and some friends. I played the original 9th Dawn years ago and loved it. 9th Dawn II so far seems to have improved in all areas and that is a great accomplishment considering how good the original was/is.If you like tile-based RPGs such as the early Ultimas, Deathlord, Demon's Winter, etc... then you'll love 9th Dawn II. I would definitely recommend this to any old school gamer especially those who grew up with the Commodore 64, Apple IIe, or Atari 8-bit computers as you most likely played and enjoyed some of those games I mention above. If so, I think you'll really like 9th Dawn II. Pick it up as the price is a steal!"
,Not Recommended,279070,30738301,Posted: 25 March,all,hitt.william,"Poor 9th Dawn II. It really has a lot of heart. I enjoyed the music in the game, as well as the scrappy feel of the whole thing. I can tell that it wasn't created by a large team or created by committee, and this lent it some charm. I played a mage character alongside a friend playing melee.One issue the game has is in the respawn rate of enemies. Enemies respawn very quickly, to the point that if you die in the middle of a dungeon, you can count on pretty much clearing absolutely every enemy a second time.Secondly, I had issues with the way that my spells were equipped. The way I wanted to play was to have a low-cost damage spell equipped in my right hand and a staff equipped in my left. This way, my character rotated between attacking with the spell and with the staff. My other spells were mapped to 1-9 quickslots. Some of the spells worked as I wanted, casting once as I hit the associated key (1,2, etc.). Other spells, when I hit the associated key, actually equipped themselves as my main attack. If I attempted to use two such spells in succession using the quickslots, the second would equip itself in the alternate hand and I'd need to open up my inventory to re-equip my staff. I actually began choosing which spells to use by seeing which ones didn't mess up my equipment when I used them.Lastly, it's difficult to figure out where you're supposed to be going in the game. Not only is the map fairly useless, but many areas in the game were sprinkled with ridiculously tough enemies. One such example was a dungeon on a coastline (there are many of these in the game). We actually backtracked to find the dungeon because we were running into really tough enemies in the other direction. Once in the dungeon, we made quick and easy work of most enemies. Coupled wih my co-op partner, I felt like I only needed to hit each enemy with 6 magical projectiles to put them down. On the third floor, there were fairy enemies (again, only taking about 6 hits to put down), but they spawned these mobile rock enemies that cast extremely painful earth spikes, spawned an area beneath your feet that kills you in a matter of seconds, and doggedly pursued you through the dungeon. These enemies seemed to take, for me, something like 30, maybe 40 magical projectiles to put down.What killed the game for me was the combination of not feeling like I could use the spells that I had unlocked as efficiently as I wanted due to bizarre quickslot issues, and the fact that the random difficulty spikes were so punishing due to the extremely fast enemy respawn rate."

The game isnt balanced very well, and if it weren't for a friend playing an archer with a rapid fire macro, (they are the only ones who can do this), we'd probably still be grinding away until this game became too tedious to continue. This is somewhat forgivable, and my friends and I finished the game despite these minor annoyances.The big problem comes from the end of the game. It becomes obvious (at least in my opinion) that this is just a cash grab.Game ruining spoiler (SERIOUSLY: Ending shown below!):This game ends with you destroying the world and a vague promise that your adventure will continue in the next game. It was a cheap game, so I find it almost comical, but it still feels kind of like a big middle finger in my face.Considering how much I paid for this game, I won't tell you not to buy it.  But knowing what I do now, I will not recommend it."

Can be proved quite confusing and not sure where to go.These are some of things i think can or must be improved on. Otherwise it's really a fun game. I hope the developer see this and take it into consideration to improve the game as i like it alot. The price is cheap enough and if you really unsure about it, buy it on sale. Note that it's still in early access and there are alot things not completed. If you are planning to buy it for multiplayer, wait until the things i listed are fixed so to have a much better enjoyable experience. Singleplayer is okay and has lesser problems since you do not have to consider of other players."

Feels like a mix of old zelda and diablo 1.The combat can feel clunky at times if the mobs attack at a 90 degree angle on top of your character, you just have to move so you can hit them.  Otherwise combat feels good.If you do not like to read quest you will not like this game. There is no quest tracker ( I could be wrong but havent found one ) so you must write down or do the quest as you find them in the wild. Usally involves going into a dungeon nearby or hunting down a nearby NPC.The world map, I wish I could zoom in on it, you are so far zoomed out it's almost useless. So far I have not found any other rarity weapons other than white, not sure if there is any other kind.Some tips to help you when you start off are:1. Invest into Con2. Do not buy items, you  will find them3. Level up all the weapon types4. Explore everything5. When over max weight it does not seem to do much to your character till you are 50+ kg over weight.6. Sometimes you will need to shoot arrows at levers to open pathways7. There are grappel hook locations? I am at the second town and have not found a grapple hook yet.I wish there was a hardcore mode, I have not tried multiplayer yet.There are boss's and areas you can go to a hour or two in that you should not go to because you will die.Overall game is a must buy for the price."

Graphics and art design are retro and quaint, but are also over-used and monotonous. Simplistic and annoying combat, with opponents whose primary defense is randomly and quickly moving around you, staying just out of your reach while keeping you within theirs. (Your sword should have a better reach than, or at least the same as, a rat's teeth, but no.) Simplistic level-up system, with limited skills acquisition. Lots and lots of stuff on the ground, 99.99% of which you cannot interact with. Too many annoying levers & moving platforms puzzles, forcing you to backtrack and wander around, searching for a way to proceed while dealing with re-spawning opponents. Way overpriced equipment, e.g. a normal pair of cloth gloves costs over 1,000 coins, but the most you can accumulate, for many levels after 1st, is less than 500.Un-installing this at just over an hour of game-play. I want my $2 back!"

76561198052386399,Recommended,279070,26171001,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,Sekai,"9th Dawn II is a nice old school/retro/insert buzzword ARPG that is more than worth the low price.  The world is quite large and open, but not empty, and all connected as opposed to individual zones.  Combat feels more like Sacred than Diablo 3 or Path of Exile.  There is a somehwat linear main quest, but also many optional side areas and quests, and for the most part, there are only minor restrictions as to where you can go and explore (This review was made 15 hours in, I have not played all the way through yet), though some areas need keys or quests completed first.  There are a couple of bugs but nothing game breaking and the dev is very active in responding to and fixing them.  Overall pretty good considering it was just released.Graphics are average, not great but not painful to look at.  Perfectly fine considering the price tag (currently $3.59, 10% off of 3.99).  My only gripe with them is that so far, most of dungeon texture has been the same generic cave-looking area, even though there are other textures in the game (desert, swamp, ruined castles/towns, etc.)Character progression is like a mix between Elder Scrolls and traditional RPGs.  You get experience for killing mobs, level up and gain HP and 5 points to divide among your base stats, but your weapon and spell skills also increase through direct use.  Increasing weapon/spell skills makes them stronger (some skills may only be used for minimum requirements for higher level weapons/spells, not entirely sure how the formula works), and spells are unlocked automatically by raising the wisdom stat high enough, and raising the related spell skill high enough for higher level spells.  There are no classes, but builds are best suited to focus on a specific weapon type  (strength=melee damage, dex=bow damage, int=staff/wand damage).Pros:Large world, many optional areasMany types of mobsNonlinear explorationSeveral builds/char types possible, giving some replay valueCons:Bows have no cooldown, making them somewhat OP but also ecouraging rapid clicking which is uncomfortable to do continuously.Inventory UI/selling is somewhat difficult to manage, you can only sell one item or stack at a time by drag and drop, but you will have dozens or hundreds of items in your inventory, some of which are hard to tell apart.A lot of similar-looking areas and dungeons.  It could use a few more textures.Other information:""Rogue-like"" tag is erroneous.  There are no rogue-like components to this game that I know of.  When you die, you respawn at your last chosen respawn point (set locations around the world) with very minor exp loss.Monsters respawn quickly, usually within a few minutes or faster.Overall it is fun and the cons are relatively minor.  I would give it an 8/10 with potential for a 9 depending on future changes/fixes."

Being that the game was realeased 2 days ago at teh time this review is being written, It is deffinately a good game to pick upLike every game there are Pros and Cons so lets start with the Cons first. This is all my opinion.Cons:1. A little wonky combat targeting but that I easily got over it.2. Some quests you have to wonder around a bit to find out what you are doing.Other then those 2 I could not think of anything else.Pros:1. Great environment. I love the art work that was done in this game. Simple yet beautiful.2. Skill point freedom, I love that I can just focus on Strength and Constitution so that I was able to passively regen the damage my enemies were dealing to me, and hit like a truck.3. Exploration. This game is full of secrets and I like that I can walk around and find a chest or dungeon in places you would not expect.Overall I loved this game and I think that it was very well done. I reccommend picking this game up if you are looking for a good Dungeon Crawler RPG."

This really is what drags down an otherwise fun game from attaining dizzy heights.For example wild animals can wander into a town and the guards don't bat an eyelid. I can pillage what little loot is in chests in peoples homes and I have nothing to fear. But meh! I guess it doesn't matter because Ahh....there is so much loot around but I can't pick it up anyway, only whats in chests.In addition to the lifelessness of the towns, the characters themselves are equally monotone and unengaging. The quests you get are pretty thin and usually involve collecting 199 items of blubber or 267 wolf pelts for 20,000 gold pieces, etc.I do like the mercentile aspeect however, but it is limited. I felt there was always a better sword to find and I would endure the lazy NPC missions just so I could get enough gold to upgrade my sword to kill yet more wolves for more pelts for more gold. But thats fine - this part works and kept me driving forward.The puzzles in the dungeons can actually be quite tricky, so a lot of backtracking is required - not sure if this is a good thing as I like a dungeon to provide a speedy exit once its completed.The combat as well wasn't too bad, I played as an archer and managed to happily hack my way through the different dungeons with different types of monsters, all with their own attacking style.If I had to pick out whats best then I think the biggest positive is the attitude of the developer who quickly addressed a large issue with monster respawn rates. I would like to see the other issues addressed but I wonder if this would be as quick a fix. Probably not."

It reminds me of when I used to play Fate: it's a simple dungeon crawler, and yet it feels like so much more.The artstyle of the game is fun, and it makes you enjoy looking around, even if there isn't much to interact with (from what I've seen so far). And the music is stunningly wonderful. While repetitive (which of course it will be, if you're in an area for long enough), but it's just so good. Some of the dialogue is entertaining, and a little of it got a chuckle out of me, while other bits tugged a heart string or two. The game has different times of day, as well as weather, from the looks of it. Which makes it pretty immersive. You, every NPC, every enemy, and every torch give out a radius of light around them (as does your mouse when you scroll around the map!). So you can see where everyone is even if it is dark or you're in a cave.Leveling up is quite simple: just accrue enough XP to level up and it does so automatically. You get to customize your character as you see fit (though I'm not quite certain what everything does yet). Even earning the currency (Silver, in this game) is pretty simple, if not a grind. Simply slay monsters and sell the loot you get (so far, that's all I've been doing).The only thing I am slightly put-off by is the lack of a map scrolling. The only way of looking at the map is opening it up (the button on the right, right below the minimap), and even then you cannot zoom in or out. The combat is wonderful, but it will take some getting used to for some players.Overall, I have definitely found a good game, and I'd like to congratulate the developers on a job well done! If anyone remembers playing Fate, you might very well like this game too! And for this price, it's a steal!"

You'll come across numerous stuff on the ground that look like necklaces, shoes, and containers but you can't interact with them. Only a very select few can you interact with.The animations are bad. The fighting isn't reallly fighting. It would have been much better as a turn based RPG, as essentially, this is what it is, but without any strategy. Trying to maneuver does nothing.

It brought me back to my Nintendo RPG games. 9th Dawn 1 was a success. 9th Dawn 2 is even better with co-op, new spells and the like. However, there are still many bugs in the game that has left my friend and I thinking twice about playing it. During coop my friend continouly gets dropped and has to reconnect and it gets old. Skills for the warrior class don't seem to work very well. This game just needs a lot of finishing touches and improvements. I also feel I got cheated in price. I love supporting Valoreware but I paid $7.99 x2 for early access for my friend and I. Now it is $3.99 or $3.59 on sale. So I bsaically paid double x2. And I spent most of my early access gameplay writing down bugs, spelling errors and having problems playing the game with my friend via coop and posting them on the bug page waiting for the dev to fix them. Some bugs were just too awful that affected the balance of gameplay when playing coop that my friend and I didn't play for weeks sometimes until the dev fixed it. I honestly think I was beta testing the game and I paid twice as much to beta test it. I think the word Early Access on any game basically means ""Pay money for beta testing"".That aside I still love playing the game. My friend and I play it only on coop when we have the time which is not much anymore. Again the game could benefit from a lot of improvements but will continue to support Valoreware if they one day continue the saga and release 9D3."

In fact, before playing all I knew of the game was a few screenshots here on Steam.  The game immediatly reminded me of Diablo 2 (questing, killling rats, picking up spider legs) but the unique leveling system certainly sets it apart.Read the full review"

Tosses ya in a world with a vauge suggestion of what to do and where to go in the vien of older elder scrolls and then just lets ya do as ya will with whats given.

I definitely agree with that, it reminds me of games like Ultima and Excelsior from my childhood, except it's realtime and has a great control scheme - if you're using a gamepad then it plays like a twin-stick shooter. With a mouse then the cursor is your attack direction, WASD to move, like many twin-stick shooters on PC also have.The game is not easy, but not hard either unlike what some others say. Sure, expect to do some grinding and expect to die - but it's not a frustratingly punishing title by any means. It's much more difficult on mobile, which is why I got it on PC.The port is fantastic, really well done. And so cheap! If you're a fan of any RPG at all, you wouldn't regret buying this - especially for that price. Just be aware that it's not a hold-your-hand game like so many these days. You're expected to READ and THINK a bit (not to the scale of, say, Pillars of Eternity, but yeah).Eh, just get it, it's cheap as heck and a really unique/nostalgic RPG. Developers like this with such heart really deserve it!"

If you enjoy a good, sound, RPG/Dungeon Crawler, but you do not have the money to pay for a high-end AAA title game, this is a good way to appease your general craving for one. Its a cheap game in terms of money, but it is not in the slightest a CHEAP game.Pros:-Beautiful and relaxing sound score-Plays like classic Runescape (if you were an oldschool RS player like me.-Leveling is rewarding-Plenty of weapons, abilities, and quests-ITS ONLY $3!Cons:-Its a bit buggy; on one of my saves, you cannot see item stats which forced me to plug in my 360 controller and scroll through my items...-Combat can become boring at times-The first few hours requires grinding in the first cave to better equip yourself (this may turn off new players)-Archery is WAYYYY OPI would give this game, for its price, lush 2D graphics, amazing sound score, and RS feel, a solid 9/10"

Very hard at parts, if things are destroying you try somewhere else lol. It could be better, but I recommend this game especially for the price."

This is my favorite ""indie"" RPG game (mobile/PC) and can't wait for 9D III.EA should hand these guys the rights to Ultima and toss them some money, would love too see what they would come up with."
