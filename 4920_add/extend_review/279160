,Recommended,279160,10894429,"Posted: 27 June, 2014",all,dairy farmer,"I recommend this game, but with a huge caveat. How much do youreallyenjoy retro platforming?Everything about this game is very well done: graphics, the Heavy Metal magazine heroine, and the fantastic soundtrack. There's even a good bit of replay value, which isn't always the case for platformers. The gameplay is... well, ""retro"".If you've never experienced actual older games, or you tend to forget how many of them actually sucked, I recommend watching a playthrough of a game called Phantis, which this game is basically a remake or spiritual sequel of. With some exceptions, older platforming games often had slow, sluggish protagonists, with fast, incessantly spawning enemies, with awkward jumping and shooting controls. This game is no exception.Serena walks slowly. She has to stand still to shoot. There's a small delay both before and after firing the actual projectile. She can only shoot up at a shallow angle (perhaps 30 degrees), but not straight up. You get hurt from touching a robot's toe or a wizard's robe. Additionally, the delay in firing means that if you try shooting just before you land, you won't fire. Even her ship takes a moment to accelerate to full speed when moving up or down. None of these would be a huge problem by themselves, but combined, it can lead to some very frustrating moments.Everything else about Ultionus is improved over the older games; why not tighten up the gameplay too? There are also plenty of other ""retro"" games that actually have really great controls.As I'm sure most can agree, it's more fun to challenge the game, not its controls. But if you love punishing gameplay, repetition until perfection, or just love all platforming games, then it's hard to do wrong by Ultionus. Even better, it's very inexpensive."

It's fun, but the fatal flaw is that every time you shoot, she stops for a moment.  You can't actually move and shoot at the same time.  Combine this with infinitely spawning enemies, and you're constantly having to stop and shoot, stop and shoot, stop and shoot...  it gets a bit monotonous."
,Not Recommended,279160,31915936,Posted: 23 May,all,Domarius,"Guys - I'm 38.  I grew up with ""retro"" games. I love them.  But unresponsive controls were unresponsive back then and even less welcome now.  I can just see the developers reading the slew of negative reviews about the sluggish controls, saying to themselves ""...but they just don't GET it!""  Well, maybe you just made a bad choice.Look at the original Castlevania.  You might think his attack restricted to forward (no up or down) and slow walking pace is just as ""sluggish"" as this, right?  Wrong.  Those controls were designed to work with the game.In Castlevania, they didn't make you a slow moving character and then pepper the screen with fast moving enemies and multiple projectiles to dodge - go look at it again.  There is the odd, occasional projectile that moves in a steady arc, and because it's an arc and not a horizontal line, you can watch the timing of it, then step out of the way.  It's not moving in a horizontal line toward you, which would require a perfectly timed jump.  And when that situation does occour, it's very rare.And look at the forward attack in Castlevania - it hits anything in front of you, and gives a long block of distance where anything caught between that 5 centimeters on screen is going to take a hit. And nearly all the enemies walk on the same plane as you. And then there are moving enemies that are specifically designed for you to pull off a well timed jumping attack, here and there, to make you feel cool when you pull it off right.In Ultionus, I didn't feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ I felt like a helpless geriatric moving through a swarm of killer bees.  This game took a badly controlled game from the past, and dialed the unresponsiveness back a couple notches, as if that would make it slightly even more retro.   I wanted to like this game.  I love the artwork, and the premise, and the female lead.  But I didn't even get through the first level and I won't pick it up again."

But... The gameplay is not quite bad but the design aimed for retro and ended up with unresponsive instead.You can aim in only 4 directions, left, diagonal left/up. right and diagonal right/up.  It would have been better as an 8-way scheme.  Or even just up - I want to shoot up.You can shoot or walk, not both.  And you walk slowly.  This may be a side effect but quickly swinging round to shoot and swinging back again seem to stick.  This is incredibly annoying when dealing with fast moving flying enemies.The crouch animation is unusually long, you must wait for it to finish before firing or walking again.  Popping down to shoot and popping back up to jump and dodge stuff is not going to happen.About a fifth of your view is obscured on the left and right by the decorative interface.  This makes the dino-riding stage particularly vexing as you can't see what's coming.I cramped my thumb trying shoot fast - I haven't managed that since I had a Commodore 64.  Not sure if this is a good or bad point.I'm not recommending this but is a weak non-recommendation.  Learning from your mistakes is big part of the game and that's good reto but not having the space to see or control responsiveness to react is bad retro.  Games like Thundercats, Mask and Turrican all got this right 30 years ago - Ultonious really should have too."

This feels like a game developed by one person or a small team that put a LOT of heart into it's creation.Important PointThere is nothing wrong/broken with the Controls, Difficulty & Length of this game.Controls:The controls are restrictive by design and require mastery.  My first attempt at was at normal difficulty.  I got wrecked, but learned a little more each time.Difficulty:By the time I decided to switch to easy I'd adjusted to the controls enough to reach the first Boss with few to no hits.  Again, wrecked.  Felt like it was impossible to react in time... and then I remembered that this games isn't about immediate reaction.  It's about pattern recognition and the many deaths required to acquire those patterns, which aren't that complicated but occasionally require pixel precision.Length:A single playthrough of this game doesn't take very long (less than 2 hours) and that was great.  That said, this game wasn't meant to be played once. It's meant to be replayed, explored, mastered and appreciated, which I plan to do.Also, I don't think the Revenge was that petty.  Respect."

The music is very good and sounds like it came from blast processing. I can really see this hitting off if this was relased in the early 90's. Challenging and fun gameplay although a little fustrating at times because there are unlimited respawning enemies at many parts of the game and it's very slow paced and requires a bit amount of patience but those things don't bring the game down at all. What really caught my eye in this game was the protag as she is purely fapbait and a busty version of Samus. I was satisfied with the ending and thought the devs did a really good job with this game.

Awesome monsters and huge-frantic boss battles. Every inch of screen is full of charm and polish.Excellent FM-Synthesis-esque soundtrack (reminds me of Later DOS games) really brings everything together.The level design is straightforward, but there appears to be multiple paths.The dev probably needs to work on conveying game mechanics a little better, as it stands there are some things that aren't ever made clear or even mentioned in game. I got an achievement for beating the game without upgrading, and I didn't even know I could upgrade! Additionally, there are some ""S"" coins littered throughout the game that I still don't know what purpose they serve. I'd RTFM, if one was even included.  The achievements menu seems to convey more about the smaller mechanics than the game does itself.The game is pretty tough, you'll probably die a lot more than you think you would based on the screenshots. I felt like this arbitrarily increased the games lenth a bit.That last point being key because the game is very, very short. 7 stages, as it says on the tin. I've only played on easy mode thus far, but my total game time from first boot to completion was 55 minutes. I assume higher difficulty levels will increase this dramatically as easy mode has infinite lives. I'll be going back into the game's normal mode momentarily.That being said, the game's actual quality is top notch, it's a ton of fun to play and look at. I see a lot of concerns about the ""meme culture"" in the trailer but rest assured it's mostly just for marketing purposes, I've yet to see any troll faces or anything of the sort in game. Only one Doge reference in the achievements menu, and I don't mind.People afraid of or disgusted by images of well endowed women should already know this game isn't for them from the cover art. I for one, have no problem there. Looking in the forums however, it would appear that this portion of the game did not filter out a large quantity of progressive type people.It's definitely worth a play. 7$ is a bit steep for a single playthrough, but multiple difficulty mode, good and bad engings and so on makes this 7$ well spent.

But this game, like a lot of older 90's classics, has a bit of a learning curve that isn't too difficult to master. Once you have the general controls pat down, it's not hard to get into the groove of shooting enemies left and right. At somepoint the control of the character becomes very second nature, which can't be said for a lot of games.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that is a big far of the classic action platforming genre. It's cheap, has tons of replayability in the form of achievments, branching level paths, upgrade choices, and multiple endings."

You lock in place when you attack, making it a commitment to fire. All this means is that you have to think about your actions before taking it. The level design is mostly set up in such a way that when you encounter a new kind of enemy or obstacle you have the means to observe it safely before engaging with it and then it'll be mixed into the standard array of things you'll be fighting, which is the smart way to do things.The game is about as monotonous as the original Metroid in terms of dealing with a lot of the same enemy, but it's a lot more linear, with a sort of Metal Slug like level design, which might feel a little dull since the reason Metroid is kind of monotonous for a first player is because you're exploring, whereas this will always have you trawling through a bunch of the same foe that's barely worth fighting.Jake Kaufman is a fantastic composer and I don't feel like I even need to describe that the music is both interesting by itself and fitting within the context of the game.Ultionus may not feel like anything new but if you're looking for something that feels like an old SNES game or a cabinet game I recommend picking it up."

I find the controls challenging in their adherence to early-90s play style (our heroine cannot walk and shoot at the same time), but that isn't where my issue lies. Rather, I think the game's ""stage"" is too small. I think that there simply isn't enough space between the player at the center of the screen and the edges of the screen to create a balanced gameplay experience. Either of these issues could exist in an otherwise fine game, but  together they conspire to make for an artificially difficult experience.As I said at the beginning, I like the look and sound of the game.

The shmup sections are actually a bit more forgiving than some of the old school schmups I've played.  They are still challenging though.  The platforming sections are a lot of fun.   Much like old school games of this type, once you learn the bosses' patterns, victory is pretty much yours.  In the platform sections you'll have to decide when to avoid enemies and when to shoot them.  Most take a few shots to kill, so you might want to just leave them behind rather than kill them all.This game encourages multiple playthroughs the old fashioned way, through hidden sections that you have to unlock to reach, including a true boss ending.  The kind of thing you might have bought a guide for in the old day.  Honestly, though, you'll probably end up coming back to this one after a stressful day at work when you just want to unwind, even after you've pretty much seen all the hidden sections.  (It's not an extremely long game, but I don't really have a problem with that.  Some long games end up just repeating the same levels a lot anyway.)The story is a nice change of pace, being based on the concept of petty revenge rather than saving the universe from the bad guys.  The whole Spacebook thing is humorous, and kind of fun for a game with such a 90's aesthetic (when Serena would surely have been using Space Geocities instead, eh?).  Serena clearly owes a lot to pulpy comic book heroines along the lines of Barbarella or Taarna from the film Heavy Metal.  (Though her story more resembles the goofy Captain Sternn from Heavy Metal or maybe one of Leela's adventures on Futurama.)Anyway, I'm recommending this to anyone I know who is currently drooling over a Retron 5, or is considering finally making that Ebay purchase of a turboExpress.

It absolutely excels at what it's meant to be, to emulate how a Snes game plays, feels, looks, moves and sounds. It's quite amazing and I've never played a game that does all of these things so well. More than that, the game also has the polish, level of detail and variety of a good, classic Snes game. I absolutely love this game.Now, there is the fact that a lot of reviews here are about how the controls are ""unresponsive"" and people write stuff like ""you can't shoot straight upwards"". This has caused me to break my hand and forehead by way of amassively violent facepalm, but now that I've returned from a lengthy, painful visit to the hospital, let me tell you people this: The controls are absolutely fine and simply notunresponsiveat all - people who claim that have no idea what they're talking about. In fact, the controls are about as responsive and clear-cut as you can get with this type of game. You have complete freedom mid-air, the movement isn't slippery, your character only moves exactly as much as you press the direction button, there are no lost inputs, nothing like that. This is way easier to control than, say, Ghouls & Goblins, old Castlevania games, old Nes games that had weird momentum physics (the original Mario Bros. counting among them) and the like.And you can do exactly as much as you need to do with your weapon. It's actually mind-boggling for me to read people writing stuff like ""you can't shoot straight upwards"" when there's really no place anywhere in the game where that would be useful.I suggest anyone who has problems with the ""controls"" to put the game on Easy mode, get a turbo controller and also a Game Genie. You can easily beat this game on Normal in little more than an hour or so and not have any problem with the controls if you're not a dink.So, I recommend this game if you like old Snes games and stuff like that and you're not a dink."

Which means it's impossible for you, the player, to get better.The game is just barely functional enough to tease me into thinking ""maybe I could pull this off with enough practice,"" but I'm not willing to suffer through that much frustration."

I love a good 2D sidescroller throwbackbut it shouldn't still feel as stiff and slow as if it was actually madein the early 90s. Bring some modern polish and slick controlsto an old platformer and I'll play that game all day long.If this game was faster paced and a bit more polishedthen I would have had a much better time with it.As is, it is basically like playing Megaman 1. No slides, charge,special moves, etc that make the combat more engaging. Just mash thatpewpew button and jump. Gets old very quickly."

Since the original review was published i've gone and troubleshooted my way about the game. What seems to be the problem is that the engine used for this game just doesn't care for particular controllers and their drivers, mine in question is MotioninJoy and better DS3. Whenever I try to switch over to those the game plummets to the 5 FPS as previously mentioned, on keyboard it stays at the constant 30 fps as designed.The gameplay is similar to all the games it mentions and is a beautiful labor of love. The music is fantastic and it has a ""classic"" level of difficulty, that being that it's rediciously hard. If you are a fan of those types of games this one is no different, and if this game were to magically be brought to the past and played exactly how it is in the late 80s and early 90s it'd be considered one of the best of the genre.Sadly it is not the 80s and 90s anymore."

,Not Recommended,279160,10580300,"Posted: 20 June, 2014",all,LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DOOOOO,"In many ways, Ultionus is something like an old Amiga game; it's got the lush pixel art and bangin' chip tunes you'd expect when stepping into Commodore territory, yet it is also unfortunately plagued with the god-awful gameplay that would forever prevent the euro school of home computing from ever obtaining the prestige its Japanese console competitors rightfully earned.First off, the controls: they just feel sluggish and unresponsive, which is only made more problematic by the game's enemies which move erratically and are generated with no real rhyme or reason. Most of the time I just find myself running past everything, hoping those three hit points will get me to the next checkpoint. Everything seems to spawn faster than you can shoot so why even try to fight back? That just puts you at risk of getting killed by the soldier or alien behind the one you just gunned down, or perhaps an entirely different direction all together.The boss fights are equally as mindless, providing nothing more than a basic memory game but without the proper animation tells to give you an idea of the pattern before you've blown through all your miserable lives. Clearly uninspired and phoned-in as an afterthought.Not all of Ultionus's problems relate directly to its gameplay; in my hour or so of playtime I found myself encountering a number of bugs, everything ranging from incidentally gaining the ability to walk in the air (harmless) to losing functionality of my d-pad after respawning requiring a client restart to fix (game-breaking). The game also suffers from framerate issues which, while one might construe this as intentional given the nostalgia factor, it apparently isn't according to the developer and his purported fix (disable gamepad support) doesn't do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥to help. The more likely reason is that Ultionus is built on the garbage-tier system that is GameMaker which to my recollection is known to be problematic for everyone involved on the distributive end.All-in-all, Ultionus is a perfect example of why some game design mantras are much better left in the past because when it comes down to it, there's a pretty big difference between classic and dated and if Ultionus were an actual retro game? It'd fall squarely in the latter, no questions asked."

I know I have a low amount of time played with this but I just can't stand to continue playing.So far the game had no interesting way of challenging me, just infinitely spamming the same 2 enemies from the sides of the screen. The first boss was just as boring, the same 2 basic attacks and occasionally spawning a minion. The fact that you shoot a whopping 1.5 times a second and the projectile is as slow as can be doesn't help either. It all together makes for a lame expereince when I have fight off a hoard of dudes limping towards me at 1 mph and the only reason I get it is because my gun is so damn slow and the game constantly spams them.The only thing I really enjoyed about this was the retro pixel style was nice to look at. I know this game is a throwback to a lot of 80's arcade stuff, which is fine until you put in gameplay and pacing that is just as dated and unwanted."

The difficulty dirrectly correlates to the terrible controls.On the second stage for instance, you will have multiple fast moving enemies bearing down on you. Most of these enemies take 2 hits to kill. Your slow firing pistol does not allow you to move while firing, so jumping over the onslaught or taking the hit seems like the best option most times.I realize I just started playing this & I may be taking the whole game out of context, but this is my 1st impression. I will edit this review after some more time in game. I would not recommend this after my 1st impression though."

Good level design and enemies variety, also the boss fights are nice and challenging.But, the controls are bad. The character is so slow and she can't shoot while walking.So, the game basically is: stop, shoot, jump over the enemy, shoot him from behind. Then, seconds after killing 2 or 3 guys,  stop, shoot the new enemies, jump over, shoot from the back again, walk, dull like that. And so on, until you find a boss. The boss fights are waaaay better and funnier than the average enemies fights.It's not a bad game at all, it's fun to explore the levels and discover hidden stuff. The only negative aspect is the controls. Ultionus controls', in my opinion, almost ruined the game. It's not like the game is unplayable, but a lot of times is frustrating how easy you die just because of the lack of walking and shooting at the same time.I recommend only if you're a fan of the genre and old school platformers. Otherwise, it's better to look for other platformer games."

But after almost two years I thought ""what the hell"", returned to the game and completed it on Easy difficuly first, and then on Normal with Good ending.I must say that this game should be seen primarily as work of art and not as something intended to ""play"" with. The art has to be consumed, and to do that, you have to learn keystrokes using try-and-repeat method. When it becomes almost automatic, you can concentrate on music, sprites and spectacular backgrounds. Which, in turn, makes completion of the game very satisfying.I want to thank the author, I will definitely buy his other game, Mystic Belle, and I will look forward for more titles from Lost Dimension. Keep on both doing the great work and having the fun!BTW, to the guys who complain that character can't move and shoot at the same time: you can shoot during the jumps as much as you want, and, as a bonus, jumping intead of walking allows you to survive longer."

If the visuals, audio, and overall presentation remain consistent, it was worth the $5 sale price even if it only lasts an hour or two. That's about how long an old PC game would've run."
