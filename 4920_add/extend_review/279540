It's uncluttered and emotionally evocative without being, oddly, pretentious about it. But the last chapter feels incredibly forced in how it tries to tie everything together. It was sort of like seeing a writer put themselves into a very interesting premise and then being slightly unsure of how to resolve it.I can't recommend this game because it struggles and falters at the finish line, but I wouldn't go so far as to dissuade someone from playing it. It's a nice walk in the park, but it rains at the end."

Pretentious Game may try to lull you into its grasp by its self-aware title, but do not be fooled, it is exactly one of those Newgrounds games where a thing loves another thing and then it conveys itself through tedious platformer mechanics.While a few of the puzzles are somewhat interesting, the game mechanics are rudimentary and the storytelling is outright bland, bordering on awful. A girl square loves a boy square, one of the squares cheats on another, yet another square dies, etc. While you can try to derive meaning from how the little poetic bits of narration correlate to the mechanics you're meant to understand on the level, the game has very, very little to offer beyond that.It is a very simple, uninteresting piece of work I do not recommend getting even for a fraction of the price while on sale. If you're interested in these types of games, I'd suggest something with a more powerful narrative to it (such as dys4ia) or something with more creative mechanics (such as problem attic - though problem attic is a very difficult game to swallow, it's certainly more interesting than this waste of time)."

Ultimately, this is not a game I would recommend to people seeing as how it doesn't really have enough actual game-play to it, but I still think it's interesting enough for people to consider looking at.ThePretentious Gameis another one of those titles that has the sole intention of potraying a story and conveying a message, while it certainly succeeds in it's aim to convey a message (quite a powerful one at that), it isn't a game, it is just another lecture.I am a fan of platformers, including minimalistic ones so this game looked like something I would enjoy, for the sake of £0.99 I thought it would be worth looking at... it was, but it certainly wasn't what I had hoped for. There is close to no gameplay whatsoever, it has a few puzzles that require little thinking to overcome and as far as platforming goes, there is no challenge here at all.Pretentious Gameis nothing more than an intereactive story I'm afraid, you would get the same result watching a play-through on YouTube as you would going throughPretentious Gameyourself.Thomas Was Aloneis a good example of what this game likely attempted to set out to be, it does a great job of telling a story while using minimalistic graphics and also has enough actual game-play and platforming in it to justify calling it a game.Pretentious Gamedoesn't, The best thing about it is the message it conveys, that's a fact. It is powerful and can really make you think about your own life and situation, so it definitely has that going for it.If you are into games that are more like interactive poems then I would say check this game out regardless of the lack of gameplay it has to offer. It's not something I regret purchasing, but it's not something that I would play again."

Pretentious Game isn't a game that I would wholeheartedly recommend to buy, especially not at full price, but it's not really a bad game by any means. At $2 price point, I would definitely recommend it, but at its full price of $5? That I'm not sure.The game is short, really,reallyshort that you can finish it at 15 minutes. Comparing even to the extremely short Sakura Spirit visual novel, the game worth even less than it in terms of worth by playtime mileage and development efforts. There is nothing really original about it, either, other games has done something to this effect and better. The ending is also another problem, as it feels like it came out of nowhere. If the game had been longer, all of the problems with this game would really be solved.Now, why do I still recommend it? Because I simply really really like the gameplay and narrative's connectment. One of my biggest gripe over JRPGs are that they are often disconnected in terms of story and gameplay, the gameplay feels meaningless and only serve as padding rather than something genuinely fun or challenging (exception exists, of course). Meanwhile, this game's presentation of narrative and gameplay really boosts each other up. The narrative, short as it was, gives a greater meaning to the gameplay as well as be the instruction while still being a story that doesn't break the fourth-wall, and the gameplay boosts the story as it feels like we're enacting the story ourselves.I like the concept, even if it's starting to get overdone, and considering that sales data are the language of video game financing and investment, I would rather pay for these kind of games to be made more than many other Tripple-A games. Not to mention that it means supporting the developers whom we can see from this game and their next game to be a creative bunch, perhaps had they had better support before, this game would have been longer and better.At the end of the day, Pretentious Game is a flawed game, but it is a flawed yet meaningful game that I would definitely prefer to support than mindless games that are neither fun nor meaningful. If you have some spare money, go buy this game, if there is a sale on it, definitely go buy it."

Finished first (leisurely) playthrough within 20 minutes.This game is like the name says: Pretentious. However, the gameplay itself is not pretentious; it is the name of the game which is pretentious.Gameplay is pretty much straight forward, you do literally as it tells you. Block styled (simple) gameplay, average music as well as a short play through is what has made me initially thumbs down. After another playthrough I decided to change to a thumbs up (explained in next paragraph). However, if the price dropped below $1 (at least), I would consider encouraging others to purchase the game. I hope there will be more added.The ending (chapter 1) was pretty anti-climatic and an eye-roller, but nonetheless, an acceptable ending. Story can be considered deep. While others hate the game I still think it is worth a play through (especially with the deal going on now), because many intellectual individuals who are willing to dig deeper will appreciate this game. It can be considered relatable, and gives you feels.Rating at current price: 6/10Rating at below $1: 7.5/10 (only because of the ending)"

The first one or two Interestingly break with some conventions and purposefully ask the player to ignore rules seemingly set up previously. The following chapters switch perspectives between various ""charactes"" (which are personified in similar ways as done in ""Thomas Was Alone"") and tell their interweaving relationships. It's about (flawed, unfullfilled) love, loss, misunderstanding and about some fates ending and others beginning. It's even more minimalistic than Thomas Was Alone. There is only one music track, no narration/voice acting, and barely any other audio. The game is offering less varied visuals than Thomas Was Alone. It was an interesting play, but a short one. Steam tells me I have 1 hour on it, should be about right, and I'm done with it already. Not sure if I would recommend it to buy at it's current full price for it's shortness and lack of challenge. It's very easy to play, mostly relaxing, except for the last chapter which has more difficult platforming parts, they are becoming some detailed jump work and spacebar hitting towards the end. Some of them may be close to frustrating, one or two for the wrong reasons perhaps, like your ""character"" clipping through boxes he jumps on into pits of fire. More chapters seem to be planned. The story could be seen as finished mostly, though the last chapter leaves some questions open regarding the perspective of one character and so I'm curious to see some more chapters added."

Only historians scrabbling at the sand and dust covered remains of our civilization will know ifPretentious Gameis one of them.I've reviewed many a game, yet not nearly enough in the public view on Steam. I've enjoyed the relative unreknown of spouting my opinions in the mere earshot of my friends and colleagues. Not that I don't think they didn't appreciate my input, as I am truly an independent man with no corporate masters, no ties to any corruption, or even accountability for mainstream taste, but rather the situation is that I have not truly subjected myself to the trials and tribulations of actually going out there and casting my net far and wide and taking the richly deserved flack that I would recieve for going against the groupthink that lies at the dark rotten heart of our society. Looking at our current political landscape, at the intolerance and pointless squabbling for power, it is easy to look at a game like this and judge it for something as lowly and unremarkable as trying too hard to conform to some alien notion of what a game should be. Worse yet, for failing to be aware of current social mores. A blue square, I hear you say unbelievingly, a blue square can approach and win a pink square. What a ridiculous stereotype to be perpetuating on the blues and pinks of the world! Even worse, to be disregarding the other colors of the rainbow who are silently erased as the other. Yet at the heart of this simple dynamic is a time-tested storytelling technique employed by some of the greats of our industry. A matter of motivation, a goal thrown to the player to be immediately grasped and reached toward, one that can immediately push the story forward despite the obstacles the game presents.One could remark that the gameplay does expand throughout the story but does not complete itself, creating and disposing various elements without rhyme or reason. This remark would not be wholly undeserved but much like the geocities websites of the 90s that were adorned with those tirelessly working men, this game makes no pretentions that it is in fact a complete game: for now there are only four chapters. In future chapters there will be room to expand on the gameplay mechanics, to make them work with each other, to expand thePretentious Game-verse. Naturally within this expanded game there will also be opportunity to make plenty of references to cater to the particular palate of our contemporary video game enthusiast. Some have naturally remarked of the game's similarity toThomas Was Aloneand it is an entirely understandable observation. My own intellect naturally pondered the teleportation mechanics ofPortal, the mind-bending alternate physics ofThe Bridge, the split second strategic ponderings ofMagicka, the unleashed player creativity ofMinecraftand many more too numerous to name in this short space.But you are not reading this review of the game that could be, you care about this game--as it is--rising from the ashes like a phoenix reborn: isPretentious Gamegood? Well, I took this time to consult the dictionary and there are truly many variations on what the word good means.Morally excellent; virtuous; righteous; pious:good? No, I must remark that video games in general lack the ability to exercise moral judgment.Satisfactory in quality, quantity, or degree:good? I was satisfied with at least one of the quality, quantity or degree of this video game.Of high quality; excellent.good? Seems too circular for definitive comment.Right; proper; fit:good?Well-behaved:good?Kind, beneficent, or friendly:good? These again seem to attribute a moral capacity to video games that they currently do not have.honorable or worthy; in good standing:good? Well, if all it takes is my mere say-so to make this game good, then I shall sayoh yeah this game is pretentious, so of course i liked it. a person worried about value for money should note that i won the game in five minutes. i spent considerably more time writing this review than i did playing the game. if the titlepretentious gamedid not make you quirk your lips into a sort of unappreciative half-smile this game is probably not for you. is that good enough for you?"

What really sets this game apart from its peers though is the way it tells the story.Instead of simply walking and having the story told to you, you actually use the story to see how you could advance the gameplay. You figure out how each stage is completeted through the text that's presented to you and it makes for a really interesting experience. It can be quite rewarding and compelling when you figure out how to get to the level by interpreting the text correctly. The game is also not afraid to break its own rules in order to keep the core gameplay interesting.While it's not the most in depth game, it most certainly lays down a very interesting template that more games should follow."

Either that or the music.Anyway, simple platforming mechanics work in tandem with the text narrative so to create a near seamless story. Nothing is there just for the sake of being there. The game itself also progresses in difficulty pretty nicely, and though a few times the story was on hold because I needed a minute to figure out what the hell to do, it never got to a point of frustration.I'm interested enough to see how the story ends that I'll keep playing it. There's 4 chapters so far, and more to come apparently, which is good news. This is a very well made game."

While that may be skewed by having played it there first, I believe that the simplistic and clunky gameplay feels a lot more natural on that platform. As for how it lives up to its title, I feel bad calling it pretentious but it really does feel very pretentious without actually having much to say.Pretentious Game explores some gameplay ideas which are ineteresting but that I had mostly seen before in experiemental flash games like the This is the Only Level series. The storyline feels frankly rather bland until quite late in the game and it ends incomplete with the promise of adding more later, which is okay on mobile but it feels very unsatisfying when played on the pc.The style feels like a budget Thomas Was Alone which, while being a bit more expensively priced, is overall a much better experience."

The early story as well was engaging, and pretty touching for such a short game. However, I found that after the first two chapters, my engagement tapered off, and by the final chapter, there wasn't as much wit imbued within the platforming puzzles, so that it felt a bit more of a grind. The soundtrack was good, appropriately fitting the tone of the game, but not developing from its inception.I enjoyed this game, but if I had payed full price may have felt a little disappointed. It offers about a hour of gameplay, without any real replayability.6/10"

,Recommended,279540,19887890,"Posted: 23 December, 2015",all,Double Uppercut,"I write this recommendation with some hesitance. I know that people who buy games expect ones to take up a decent amount of their time. I once thought that if a game was longer, that made it better, and would criticize shorter games based on their length (my arguement against Over the Void, and my criticism of the original Portal come to mind), but I think in some ways I've changed my stance on that view. But I know plenty of other people haven't. That's fine. They can suck it.Pretentious Game is a game without about as much length and content as Over the Void, but the biggest difference between the two that keeps me from changing my recommendation from a ""no"" to a ""yes"" on Over the Void, is the type of content each contains. Don't get me wrong, these two games have nothing similar, apart from their hour's worth of playtime. But between games like these and even Hook, is that Pretentious Game intends to tell a story, and uses it's mechanics not only to teach the player what they need to do to beat a level, but also tell them the context of what's going on.Sure, there are bits, where I had no idea that the red blocks were supposed to be a car. I personally the mechanics and story got a little wobbly during the third and fourth chapters. But the first and second were pure gold for me, and I couldn't stop playing. Sure, it can pick up mechanics and later drop them oddly enough. Some mechanics don't fit well into the story (Hangliding? Really!?), but what Pretentious Game succeeds at, it does well. The nonlinear storytelling between the three chapters sets up what might at first seem to be a simple story, but gradually branches out and explains everything. Did I like chapter four at all? No. Not really. It kinda stunk of BS, and had little to do with the events of the preceding chapters, other than the kids were related to the one woman.But Pretentious Game is pretentious, as much as it is a game. It's a little too overdramatic, and little cheesey here and there, but it has some pretty dark imagery for a game where the art is all made of pixels. You'll only get about an hour's worth of gameplay (and there is little replay value), but if a fifth chapter were released, I'd still install it again just to find out what happens next."

Going ""aww"" and ""oh no...""That said, this is a pretty neat game that I played twice just to let the whole story sink in.Pros;+ Easy to play. You learn what you need to do very quickly.+ Puzzles are relatively simple. The levels only become different in small steps. The text/phrases you get every level are enough to hint what you need to do.+ Some of the puzzles are very clever and brilliantly thought up. This game doesn't only make you use your arrowkeys, but also makes you experiment, use the mouse, the mute button, etc. The game mechanism really enhances the strength of the story and doesn't hold it back.+ The story is told in a minimalistic art style which made it easy to understand.+ And the story is pretty good. It was a bit simple, but made me very emotional because of it.Cons;- I had a lot of difficulty at the (hidden?) fourth chapter that featured the two children. This was because of a jump trick you needed to do several times in a row. Needless to say, it made me suffer immensely and I never want to play that chapter ever again.- The game is short (but sweet!). I replayed the first three chapters and managed to entertain myself for 101 minutes total. Sometimes I wish the game was a bit longer.- I really hate how sudden the car scenes were and the (short) noises that came with it. I am a very sensitive gamer, so noises like that and sudden motions make me very uncomfortable. It was a bit of a jumpscare for me.So is this game worth your money? Depends on if you think the price of the game is worth around 1~2 hours of gaming entertainment. For me it was worth it. Despite all the negativity in my review, I am very happy to have played this and the story will probably stick in my mind for a week or so.I think this game is great for the casual gamer. Please give it a try if you can."
