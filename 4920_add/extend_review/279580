,Recommended,279580,13206151,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,Tetsuo9999,"Devil's Dare is a love letter to the 80's and 90's kids who grew up playing classic beat-em-ups like Final Fight, Double Dragon and Turtles in Time. The main twist to the formula is roguelike elements, but it doesn't feel as refined as other games in that genre. Players must acquire money from monsters, objects and kill bonuses, and said currency is used to purchase continues upon death, as well as upgrades at the end of a level. There are four stages to choose from, and the order they are completed in determines both their overall length and the boss fought at the end of the run.The combat is standard beat-em-up fare with some modern additions. Each character has three special attacks that can be used as long as the SP meter is full, and the standard combo breaker move at the expense of a full SP bar. Dash attacks round out the moveset, and each special attack can be upgraded via post-level purchases. There is also a unique kill bonus mechanic where killing several enemies at once with an SP attack yields money and/or healing items. Mastery of this mechanic is probably what causes the discrepancy on this review page in terms of players saying that the game is too easy or too hard. A player who mastered older beat-em-ups will be able to use those old tactics here to get an abundance of money and healing items, while someone newer to the genre will struggle to get a run past the first level. The combat is nothing innovative for the genre, but all the systems work in conjuction with each other.Sadly, the roguelike element of this game needs some work. Unlike other games in the genre, there are no unlockable items in this game; everything is unlocked at the start and there isn't a large selection to choose from either. This indirectly means that the game doesn't have as much replay value as the games it will be compred to. Character builds will always end up quite similar regardless of how many times you play through the game, and there's simply not much to do after unlocking both endings aside from achievements. I played this game for three hours and was able to learn the game, unlock both endings and fight all but two of the ending bosses, and there's not much else to see. I feel that it's best purchased during a sale where one wouldn't feel pressured to get tons of hours out of the game, but it's good for a couple runs. Each run is a little over an hour long, so it would probably only take 8-10 hours for the average player to see everything the game has to offer. Multiplayer runs apparently make the game harder since money management comes into play, but your mileage may vary with that as it's local only.Overall, I don't regret my purchase, but I do wish the game had more to offer. I have already seen 80% of the game's content, and I've also tried out the majority of the items in just two full playthroughs. Check it out during a sale for sure, but don't expect to dump dozens of hours into this game like other roguelikes."
,Not Recommended,279580,15345920,"Posted: 13 April, 2015",all,Justin_Brett,"This game is a nice idea with a lot of charm, and I'd been looking forward to trying it for a while, but Devil's Dare has too many problems for me to recommend it.First off, money is extremely important in the game but the only reliable way to get a lot of it is killing monsters with special moves, meaning combat is all about spamming them constantly. Feels restrictive, not to mention that some of them just aren't worth using, or can even miss, since two of them are used by holding a direction and pressing the button. If you die in a stage you can only come back if you spend money, and the cost goes up every time. Don't have enough or an item to save you, and your whole run is gone.Compounding this is that everything about the game seems designed to punish you if you make any mistake. Get hit by an enemy, and you're stunlocked for a bunch of damage unless you use a move that drains your special bar, keeps you from using them until it completely recharges, and is pretty unresponsive. Die in a stage and you probably won't get a proper upgrade for it. Even helpful things can screw you over, as a lot of the time I got hit because my character decided to pick up money instead of attacking. It feels like they wanted to take everything from the old arcade beat-em-ups, even the frustrating parts that were products of the time.It does have an easy mode, but even then the game doesn't really feel fun or satisfying to play. This review is done from the perspective of single player, granted, but it's probably not all that likely you'd play it with others, since there's no online co-op. If they added some, maybe it would be more fun, but as it is there are beat-em-ups on Steam already that do grant that option, like Castle Crashers or Double Dragon Neon. I'd try one of them before this game."

It continuously opens in portrait mode for no apparent reason and there's no option to fix it.  It cuts off the edges of the gameplay screen and makes it impossible to play.  For these reasons alone, you should avoid this game.  But if you want more...The gameplay is very annoying.  The only way to get anywhere is by attacking large groups at once in order to get combos which reward you with health drops.  Other health drops might as well not exist, you simply can't get anywhere without doing this.  The problem with that is that enemies don't group themselves naturally very often.  What does that mean?  That means that if you want to advance, you will spend the majority of your time running away and kiting enemies around to get them into groups.  Ten seconds of kiting for one second of slashing.  That's like the opposite of fun and the opposite of what I want to do in a beat/slash-em-up.  I want to hit bad guys, not run from them, and certainly not dance  with them!"

There's a very slight learning curve but the game is no where near as hard as some players claim and I certainly didn't find the ai mechanics ""cheap"". Beat this in the first sitting with $20,000 coins to spare (*note: coins earned through killing enemies, etc. are the means by which the player continues and purchases upgrades for their chosen character. Characters are unique and play pretty differently from one another despite having the same controls, and the upgrades are useful.

But good things end right there.Being a pixel-art game, it has a limited resolution and does not seem to scale well to a modern widescreen monitor, stretching instead. Why is that, I have no idea.And the most frustrating part is the difficulty spikes in the game.Get to the first boss and prepare to die A LOT. Every death will set you back to the very friggin' beginning of the whole game.Turbo-mode gamepad fixes that a bit, but you will still die. Don't smash it in frustration.It's a nostalgia trip all right - you get all those bad design decisions from the arcade era, like lives and limited ""continues"", impossible difficulties and sometimes unresponsive controls.I never finished TMNT on my NES when I was younger. Years later I found out that the game was not impossible to beat, but it had a form of anti-piracy protection (and it turned out I was using a pirated game) that ramped up the difficulty up to 11. We did not know that. We just kept on playing, never knowing that vidogames were not about frustration.This game is all about frustration. It largely reminds me not only of that old TMNT on NES, but also of Strike Suit Zero on PC. That is to say, ""cheat if you want to actually enjoy it""."

Deaths feel cheap and unfair, and most of the time there is nothing you can do about it. Very limited moveset, imbalanced characters, etc. What is more, while playing with a xb360 controller i found it hard to pull off a specific special attack, as the game mixes up up/down sp with left/right sp frequently. Lining up your attacks with enemies is also hard, since you have to be EXTREMELY precise, unnecessarily so. This game might be better with friends, but solo play is highly NOT recommended.At least the music and graphics are nice.If you want a good brawler, just go play a far superior game - Castle Crashers."

And there's no part of that sentence that I don't love.Though I'll say right now that if you're playing in single player, you're in for a rough ride. There are moments in the game (especially bossfights) that really feel like they require a team effort. Or at least somebody to run defense while somebody's on offense. Which in a way, really adds to that old arcade charm. (though it's local co-op only)It also features a permadeath system that's really going to hurt. You can buy an extra life, but it's expensive. On the bright side though coins usually aren't too hard to accumulate before the bossfights, and you can also buy continue tokens. Money management is a big part of the game, so spend wisely.It also has partial controller support, but I was playing with the keyboard so I can't give you much information on that. It's just oldschool right/left/up/down, attack, special. No complaints there.They recently added a ""casual"" mode that's a little more friendly for the single player. However, it WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU FOR IT. When you reach the end, it basically just gives you a big ol' slap in the face and says you don't get the real ending because you're a casual. Which is a little annoying because I'm certain there are others like me who'd play this game alone.

It seems like every attack you make leaves you open and requires a bit of presicion timing to master. The hit box system can be a bit unforgiving at times, if you get juggled by enemies, kiss your♥♥♥♥♥goodbye. It's a bit infuriating that you only have a single life to complete an entire stage and if you run out of cash or didn't take the proper upgrades, you're basically in a stalemate and need to start all over again. :/On the other hand if you hack your money via cheat engine the entire game becomes trivial and it's where the real fun is to be had.... Infinite continues, no consequence and just button mashing mayhem... so it's a bit of a design flaw, but I'm not really complaining as it made the game a lot more playable.The gameplay is a bit too simple for my liking as well (Not even a jump button - so this means ZERO aerial moves) Like WTF? >.< Who designs a beat 'em up game without a jump button or some small platforming elements like jumping over pits? In a game that throws everything and the kitchen sink in for old school references then skimps out on a simple jump feature is just mind boggling... seems a bit lazy.The game can be a bit unstable at times, I've had the game just go bonkers on me during a couple of boss fights. The music will cut out and make some annoying noise, if this happens the boss will just disappear off the screen and you'll have to quit out and reload as there is no way to progress.Another gripe is no online co-op... only local... I mean did we learn nothing with Scott Pilgrim? In todays age, no one has real friends, just people they know and use when they need something. :P Why not implement the convenience of online co-op? Any game without this feature in todays age is just a failure in my books. Especially a small indie game like this with 2D graphics... is it really that hard to implement some net code?Final Thoughts:It's not worth the price of admission until they fix some bugs, add more features like online co-op and just re-balance some of the item costs and character abilities. I also wasn't a fan of the RNG at the end of the stages for power ups, sometimes you're left with really undesirable choices AND you have to pay for the stupid upgrade... It's annoying if you can't afford them or just don't want any of the upgrades listed.Under the current circumstances, I just can't justify recommending this game at the current 12+ dollar price tag. In this state it's worth like 5 bucks. Thank Goodness River City Ransom Underground is just around the corner, it's going to be a retro beat 'em up done properly.Good attempt but this game will just fall in to the recesses of obscurity and no one will care despite the effort put forth... a shame really."

I beat the game and got the ""good ending"" on my second playthrough with a total of 2.1 hours played. I'm not particularly good at brawlers, nor do I play them a lot, but I breezed through classic arcade (the toughest difficulty) in single player with almost no resistance. The game only requires you to master two skills: herding enemies and using your stunlock/knockback skills effectively. Since both of these skills are essential to any brawler, it's far too easy for moderately-experienced players to quickly beat the pants off of this game.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this game for the two hours I played, but until they add in more difficulty options I can't recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge. If you're crummy at brawlers or you just want to enjoy some mindless couch co-op with friends then it'll probably give you your money's worth; if you cut your teeth on unfair arcade brawlers during the NES/SNES era then you'll blow through it like wind through a screen door."

In most instances it doesn't even get the references correct - it simply flails about and goes 'LOL LOOK I MADE VIDYA GAEM REFERENZ'. One example off the top of my head - ""I'm going to kick him in the nuts, Johnny Cage style"". Another is using a red version of Navi from a Legend of Zelda game, with the annoying 'Hey Listen', except in a much deeper voice. When the sword user (Link copypaste) throws his hook shot he shouts 'Get Over Here' ala Scorpion. The writing is horrid - ""The world went from bad... to a total♥♥♥♥♥♥storm."" Did a high school student write that line?The blatant pulling of assets from other games is atrocious, as well. One of the characters uses sword & shield and these assets are simply exact copies of Link's items from Legend of Zelda. The MagiTek armor from Final Fantasy is another example. Even the SP meter refills that drop are copies of Mega Man energy drops.The devs also utilize the 'retro pixel style' as a selling point - this is pretty obvious from the video on the Steam page. If you're going to try and convince me your game is retro at least get the game references correct. This just makes you look like a pathetic indie hipster.I used an Xbox 360 wired controller for my attempt at playing this game. The controls were fairly responsive but imprecise - for example trying to pick up a cash bag required you to be in a very specific spot which was nigh impossible to achieve with the way the analog stick moved the character. Perhaps another controller would do the trick but I doubt this. In addition picking up items is linked to the attack button, which is just ridiculous. The game didn't even give me a chance to pick up my hard-earned items at the end of the stage - after I killed off the last zombie my character did a victory pose, the stage ended and all those cash bags on screen were lost. Take that player!This is the sort of thing that makes indie devs look bad. Instead of ripping assets, making video game and video game culture references and using pixel art they need to actually develop their own style.TL;DR: typical indie cash-in attempt on 'vidya gaemz' and pixel art, imprecise movement controls"

I grew up playing games like Double Dragon and Golden Axe with friends. This appeared to replicate the feel of these game and add in-jokes to films and retro game characters. I purchased it at £7.99 thinking I was bound to get my monies worth and I love supporting Indie games.However, when I loaded the game up everything seemed far from polished. My Xbox controller would not work even though this is clearly an arcade game. I had to go into settings and map the keys. Okay not the end of the world but still a bit of a pain, Then I chose my first character playing solo (Golden Axe) on the sewer level he seemed okay once I got used to the moves via the tutorial and my adventure began. Having the screen set to full screen I wandered around killing mobs. This was quite fun and I found I could get food by doing certain moves at the right time. A few traps got in the way but nothing that couldn't be avoided. Then I got to the boss (The Fly basically). He seemed challenging but I wasn't expecting a walk in the park (as I knew this was old skool). I dragged him to the center of the screen to hit him. Then he started getting harder as they sometimes do and after dying for the firts time I realised he was able to fly out of my field of view and shoot me. I had to follow him into the dark and try and hit him. This was mostly a failure and I died. After experimenting a bit more with the game I realised that for some reason the game settings mean I can't see what is going on the left and right hand side of the game. Basically I will be unable to beat any bosses alone whilst this exists and this game is just another pointless number in my collection.Even if this was fixable I think I would find this game un-inspiring for the price and would rather play some of the other old skool beat 'em ups like the Double Dragon re-boot or the Sacred attempt.

For example take the game Nuclear Throne, that games art and music are fantastic, but favorite part about it is how quick I can restart my game when I get killed. I really hope they can cut the restart time on this game short, and also I dont think the ""delete saved data"" text is necessary at all. Other than that though the rest of the game (what I've seen at least) is really awesome!"

This is the game for you. Money is god and skill is the only way to get it in this game. Awesome pixel graphics, fluid gameplay, and good amounts of replayability. This is a great game to play with friends or by yourself if you want. Give the demo a try to see if your interested and if you do wanna buy it, why not add me for a friendly jaunt of murder through this delightful game that is Devil's Dare."

The game has been made for hardcore gamers that like a little challenge... so expect the game to be a bit hard but with a bit of practice and upgade you will overcome it. But there is a casual difficulty level it its too much for you..."

Also you cant even jump for combos and that is the basic thing in beat-em-ups. for real i wasted money on this♥♥♥♥♥♥ i rather play castle crashers which covers all of that and it is even more fun that this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is also from the same people who brought you tobys♥♥♥♥♥adventure which is basic ♥♥♥♥♥ dungeon crawler. so if you are a basic ♥♥♥♥♥ and like basic ♥♥♥♥♥ games then this is the game for you.

I bit of a learning curve in how to keep going with continues  and  I will say it would be even better with full controller support. It bugs out sometime during movement.  But I can't say that I haven't had fun.

I think the content and the gameplay was good and it really takes some strategic thinking to avoid getting hit and to keep your HP healed up. If you're smart about it you can get through the entire game without dying.There are two things that make me not recommend the game. Controller sensitivity appears to come either too high and you make movements you did not intend resulting in completely different special attacks or that you get stuck on environmental objects. Your character has to stand in place to swing their weapon so stopping to destroy and object when enemies are on your tail can be deadly.Honestly, what tipped me further into this direction is that I made it all the way to day 9 and was in an elevator level. I got knocked into a environment box and was clipped into the floor then transported back in time to get knocked off the platform and die. I can accept defeat from standing too close to an edge while fighting on normal circumstances but when it looks like I got glitched into that situation is just annoying."
,Recommended,279580,14910611,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,Silvarren,"Devil's Dare is definitely a fun game. Full of references, little easter eggs, and a bunch of fan service-y type things. That said... it's not exactly a smooth game. The game controls very much like the original Double Dragon. As in, every action feels very deliberate, and somewhat clunky at times. Button mashing will get you killed. Not paying attention will get you killed. Poor placement / timing / usage of abilities will get you killed.Devil's Dare is hard, but not unfair. If you like, consider it the Dark Souls of beat 'em up games. Continues are hard won, and levels are usually beaten with a fraction of health left. You have to be smart about the perks you choose at the end of each level, particularly towards the end.I think one of my favorite things about Devil's Dare isn't that it's meta, but that it's meta about being meta, almost like it's mocking itself for referencing what it is. If you get the bad ending (and I did, at first), the game legitimately shames you for being so selfish / bad. It actually made me want to try again and again.I'm not sure what the solo experience is like, and quite frankly, I'm glad that it doesn't have online multiplayer. Timing / client issues that would happen aside, this is a couch / party type game, and I can't imagine it would have the same feeling / intensity online as it does when you're sitting next to friends, either high-fiving, or going ""Ooooooh nooooooo~"" with each other.Lastly... This isn't really a pick up and play type game. If you play this casually, you will probably not have a lot of fun. This is something you sit down with a group of friends and say to yourselves, ""Ok, this is what we're going to do. We're going to kick this game's♥♥♥♥♥ or die trying. Repeatedly."" It takes practice, patience, and a bit of dedication to learn how to beat enemies and bosses.Anywho... It's a good game if you're up for a challenge and are one of those weird people who has friends that can play next to you. Good luck!"
