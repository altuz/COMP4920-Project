76561198002230961,Recommended,279720,18049815,"Posted: 15 September, 2015",all,Slow Cobra,"Once Upon a Time, when the gaming community was young, and coptures - old, game developers had the guts to try and put some new and truly unique stuff into their games, rather then just copy - paste a single successful formula for every given genre. Giving this game a try, you will learn why, and come to appreciate the fact these good old times have past.This game used to amaze back in the day, it was the first time gamers were given a try to play an RPG that doesn't blindly follow the ""knight in shiny armour killing the archdemon"" cliche. The graphics rocked (in 2002), the feeling of flight on your own set of wings, and the ability to dive down and catch your rival to have a bloody snack up in the air were amusing. BUT back in the day we were used to having to relearn and remaster the controls for every new game that we played, we were used to having to deal with clunky controls and some minor inconveniences in the overall gameplay. The tradition of implementing high quality, touching stories with complex characters had not yet been settled in the industry. We loved games mainly for their gameplay and the fresh experiences they brought us.Today most games deliver several genres in one pack, like shooters where you can fly a plane or ride a car e.t.c. The things that made this game look cool more than a decade ago are fairly trivial for the modern gamer, while the flaws look outrageous. The game has an unappealing story, the quests are boring and repetitive (go to an area kill all the monster, then go to another locations and do ""the exact same thing over and over again""), the controls are oldschool (clunky + underworked = inconvenient). This game is bad by all modern game standards, but this game was developed in the times when those standards were only a work in progress.Summary:If you are a player from back in the day, taking the low price of the game to notice, you might want to take a glance to the past with this one, it might be a useful experience. Or if you are new to gaming and want to feel how it realy was to play them ""good old games"" you might want to get it while on sale. In other cases take a second thought before you press the ""buy"" button."
,Recommended,279720,14820757,"Posted: 10 March, 2015",all,Tessai,"The game was initially released with files missing, which has since been fixed. What you have now is a wonderful RPG where you get to play as a mighty dragon. I played this game quite a bit over the years and was very surprised to see it pop up on steam.The I of the dragon is quite relentless in its default difficulty (5) but can be adjusted to either 1 or 10. I do not recommend putting it higher as the game was clearly not properly designed for it. The game is rather slow paced by default and turning all enemies into tanks that just take way too long to kill is not fun, only tedious.There's 3 different Dragon classes; Necromancer, Mage and Warrior, the latter focussing on its fire breath over magic use. Each class has unique skills and specializes in different stats (which are cheaper to level up). The necromancer ends up being the middle ground class with some summoning options.As you level up you can spend points on stats and purchase spells (for said points). Its up to the player to balance it out.Spells in this game are quite awesome and deserve to be mentioned seperatly. There is a wide range of spells and with the ability to litterally summon mountains and giant craters you can terraform the land around you quite dramatically impacting enemy movement as well. Yes after some time the land will turn back to its original state but it takes quite a while and it looks impressive. Really makes the player feel powerful.However, as for downsides; There are a couple of segments in the game where you are forced to play as other characters and these segments are just plain terrible. There's no way around it, they should never have made it in the game. However they happen relatively late and can be finished somewhat quick with some practice.Overall,  if you like the idea of controlling a mighty dragon that grows incredibly strong over time, get this game. Yes it's a bit dated but the game is unique enough that there really isn't a better modern alternative. This IS the best dragon RPG out there."

Big fan ofGOG.com.I bought this game back in 2004 and played it then. It was alright, especially since games that let you play as a dragon are few and far between. Yeah, it got fairly repetitive since the majority of the game is hunting down monster spawners and killing then, usually via fly-by attacks. (Would've been better if they used mouse-based flight a-la Freelancer since you use said mouse for some controls. And yes, Freelancer came out before this.)However, this is no longer that game, and even at $2, I can't recommend it. The controls are still awkward, but now they're worse since you can't remap the keys unless you use a fan-made patch. Also, the game has a CTD problem trying to play the opening movie unless you delete it, and trying to rotate the camera is especially painful as sometimes it starts moving right away, and sometimes it takes up to a full second before it even starts moving. If this was turn-based, it'd only be annoying, but this game is very much action-based. (This is also fixed with a fan-made patch.)The devs have already gone on record saying that there won't be any patches or improvements to the game as they have lost the source code. Look guys, if you don't have the source code and/or can't fix any problems that arise with the game, DON'T RELEASE THE GAME. The gameplay has gone from ""not bad"" to ""broken mess"" simply because these issues can't be fixed due to being unable to update the game for modern systems. The saddest thing is,GOG.comhas set a standard for updating old games, and this falls well below it.Fix the controls so somebody doesn't need three hands to play the game/restore the ability to remap keys, fix the CTD issues, and the lag when trying to rotate the camera, and this game might be worth the asking price. As it is, this game is a broken mess and despite the graphics not aging well, it might be worth playing again.EDIT: BTW, those review scores up there at the top of the page from Actiontrip and Gameshark? Those are from the '04 edition. The Gameshark site isn't even around anymore."

The steam store is flat out lying, this game does not contain any english audio, in fact it does not even contain any scripts to trigger cut scenes for the game to even properly start.  If you directly buy this off the steam store and fire it up into a new game you will be met with a weird end game start, (You have access to end game areas right from the get go, which should not be the case).   If you want to play it you will have to download a few missing files that are available on the steam fourms other wise it is in an absolute unplayable state."
,Recommended,279720,16130266,"Posted: 2 June, 2015",all,[Nyan] SpacemarineCat,"First Question: Is this game worth buying?Well yes, for us old people it is fun to play games with sub par graphics that are from 2004 (correct me if i am mistaken). Really don't expect this to be anything like super fancy and spyro like, don't expect graphics to which you can actually see teeth on the model. But, this is not for people who want things that have more options to being a dragon such as landing or interacting. This is more of I am going to burn and destroy every living thing I see.Second Question: What is Gameplay like?-You fly around.-You make human towns because apparently women aren't pooping babies fast enough or the babies are getting eatten by Diablo...-You never land because you are magically suspended into the air.-You get hit by the most annoying enemies and have to use your manuverbility to actually fly around and avoid being hit. Hint: just fly up and down :)-Somehow I get shot out of the air by a blast of fire that I have no clue where it came from O.o-It is still challenging dispite you fly around and burn stuff. P.S: You have spells because you a bloody magical dragon.-You have 3 classes of dragons only.-The graphics are that of N64 and PS1.-Also I get to eat food on the go!Third Question: Why write this review?I am a friggin dragon.Also I think it deserves a review that just because it's not like modern day games doesn't mean it isn't good. For it's time it was pretty cool, but just remember that older games had a weirdness of being simpler yet fun and straightforward such as Fate, Bejeweled, Diablo 1, Warcraft 1... and so on.Once again....As I said I wouldnt recommend this to people who want to interact with other things or do more complex actions than casting spells, burning monsters/spawners, and flying around. This is not a complex nor intense game. It's pretty straight forward but the balance of the game is slightly off and requires you to actually think and react to overpowered mobs shooting at you. Not a perfect game but like I said it's a cheap timewaster."

Neither awesome nor bad. = Nice. I enjoyed to play with it.The control was uncomfortable for me at first because I hadn’t flown before.

76561197995669628,Recommended,279720,32074842,Posted: 30 May,all,Sorokonojka,The I of the Dragonis basically a Dragon RPG with some territory control management. I am actually enjoying it but it has very complicated control system . You will have to use about half of your keyboard. Even when you master controls there are some problems with camera angles and action detection. Sure the game is far from perfect but for a niche concept like dragon simulator it is not terrible. Saying that I would only recommend it to people who are comfortable using lots of hotkeys and can forgive dated graphics.Pros:+Decent RPG elements with good depth and unlocks.+Lots of spells that can create big explosions and natural disasters.+Sometimes requires calculated strategy instead of brute force.+3 Playable characters+Boss Battles.+Limited territory management where you build towns that help you keep your turf.+One of the few actual Dragon simulators  (cartoony platformers do not count)+Challanging difficulty.+Easy to understand goals.+Decent lengthCons:-Camera angles are a constant chore.-Not the most intuitive movement system. You have to click the mouse to move/dodge while spamming hotkeys to aim and fight (which is a bit complex)-Occasionally frustrating mechanics. Too many enemies with homing attacks .-Can be tedious after awhile.-Lame autosave feature that does not save between many key events ( will have to spam save often )Verdict: 6/10This game kind of reminds me MechWarrior in a sense that you have to manage many hotkeys. It is really not bad but mostly suffers from old mechanics and controls that are not very intuitive . If you played many complex PC games in the past you may find some nostalgia here. RPG elements go pretty deep so at least it is fun to power up your dragon and unlock new spells.
76561198029279052,Recommended,279720,29470255,Posted: 24 January,all,Svarzter,"This game is just great. 8.5 of 10, even in 2017.You are a real DRAGON. You have dragon magic, you are strong, you fight as a protector of humanity. Game has a huge potential to be something more. But still - dragons in this game are MUCH MUCH better, than in Skyrim. Story is simple, acting if 50/50, gameplay has a lot of grinding.Game is not that easy, yet not hard too. It's well-balanced.You can play as a firebreating Annoth, icebreating dragon-mage Barroth or dragon necromante Morrogth. Every dragon has his own pros and coins, diffrent stats better suit one but not the other. For example - Annoth is a warrior like, Barroth is more like tactical-assassin gameplay, while Morrogth is a necromacer - a little RTS (without ability to command, only spawn units at your side).If you love dragons, want to play one where you can really feel like a dragon - this IS the game for you. It's the best game atm of every other games, where you can be a dragon - to play in.About ""steam crashes"" I had 0. My friend too. You can find some if you use cheats or mess with game, but without this - you're safe to play. Game will work correctly.Any devs reading this - please create a game like this, but with 2017 abilities!"

,Recommended,279720,33086174,Posted: 1 July,all,Lawrenjin,"I was quite surprised to find this game here after so many years since 2004-2006-2009 I was used to play it. I just love it, it was awesome back then and still IS one of the most favorite games of mine.It is still the one and only high quality dragon RPG. I still haven't seen since it finished and SERIOUS games where you can play as a dragon and more — this game has a quite normal plot. Easy one, but serious. And an idea. I reccomend to try it to all dragon fans who's not pity about how old this game is. About how old graphycs and gameplay is. If you like things like this — at least give it a try.Many people said here about bugs, controls, problems, etc. Earlier I had original CD and what I can say, that there always were some problems with it; as I've heard, earlier developers have lost workdata of this game and couldn't fix many things by then. There were some fan-fixes, but still they've couldn't fix all. In many cases game haven't worked at all. There were no background music, chashes on a map change, control freezes. Now I see that the Steam team and community is really working on it, trying to make things better. And they really doing things better — the issue with background music (wich simply haven't worked on a platforms higher than Win2000) now is solved and gone. For now they've really solved many old issues. All works fine. Earlier I've played and passed all it through on Windows 2000 (for the original version of the game it looks like the only OS with wich The I of The Dragon works without any problems at all), Windows XP (haven't worked at all without serious manipulations, at least in my case neither I, nor my friends couldn't fix it and launch — it was completely broken), Windows 7 (worked fine but without music, hehe; sometimes had a control freezes). This version I've tired on Windows 8; I haven't play it long for now, mostly for testing, though, but by this time I haven't found any really serious issues, if not count one with startup-video that plays souns but has black screen instead the video. But with comparison with all other what was with it earlier... it's a complete minor.And by that time were lack of guides about how you can fix all these problems; earlier at some problems were no answers at all; now It was surprisingly to find there many of them here, on steam + support. I think, with some time and one day they'll fix last serious issues with it.For now, you will probably need to deal with having some technical issues, but known bug fixes now you can find in the community guides. Earlier, many years ago, there was NONE of that.About controls; some said that you will need all of the keyboard + complete mouse, but it is a little not fair. Controls really can be a little bit complicated before you get used to them, because you'll need many keys for MAGIC (numbers, and, if I remember correctly, F-s), but basically what you'll really need for comfortable game — arrows on keyboard, maybe WASD, tab, left shift and space + one or two keys for aim. And a map. And that's all. More or less controls of an old standart for two hands; you'll need mouse only to change angle of a view (or set this separately on keyboard) or aim on enemy on wich dragon doesn't aim automatically by some reasons (usually landscape's specs). You can change all the keys (now it is working, at least on Win8x64 — earlier it worked only on Win2000, at least for me), and with some experiments find the comfortable control settings of your own.Back in the original version there already were normal controls set. Now you'll maybe need to find a fine settings by your own by playing with them for some time, but that's not such an awful thing.Also you can TRY to set gameplay mostly on the mouse, but this, in my opinion, is a harder way.All other playing and upgrade system is pretty easy understandable; as a serious cons I can say only that the game really may be linear and monotonic for modern players since gameplay by itself is simple without many-many things to do and can become boring. But it's ok if play it with some pauses between. You will need to build cities and sometimes to protect them. Beat the monsters. You can't land your dragon since he's prisoned to be forever in the air, but...Therewill be landed episodes, and they're pretty hard. Mostly after them is such a happyness to get back in the air. =)But no sidequests and things like that. It's just a linear story and the enemies. And views around...You will have 3 different dragons at choice: red (fire one) is the easiest to play since he's the strongest both magically and phisically. Blue (ice) is the most beautiful of them, but also this one is the hardest way to beat the game, since he's pretty weak but good at magic... but at ahigher levels; from the start it can be difficult to play with him, also further you will find many difficulties because of his specs. But he's interesting. Challenging in many ways, but still my favorite. Acid one is something between them both, but also has his moments. And also not so easy one to play with. You will ""raise"" your dragon all game long, making him stronger, adding abilities-spells.Also overall difficulcy of the game can be changed.Graphycs were amazing back then and even now, when it counts as pretty aged, it is still way more beautiful than in many other modern 3D games, especially if count its not so high price. It is simply beautiful; the overall design, the landscapes. Dragon's moves seems anatomicaly realistic. You'll also have a change of a daytime by day/night/sunset/sunrise! With all the lights and colors. And it came from 2004! Many nowadays games don't have such a beauty.Another thing, that I've actually disliked a bit, is the change of an original soundtrack. I'm still keeping the records from original CD and now thinking that that first OST is still fitting more to all this, but maybe there were reasons to change it, also as with the language.Well, I think I've said enough already — back ago I've played much time in it and still have nostalgic feelings about it. Maybe I'll have some time to replay it fully now. I had original Russian version and it also feels a little weird that here is no original language, but it will be interesting to play in it on English. Something new. =)Good luck with work on it, guys; and real thanks for this release and all the effort you've already had put into it."
,Recommended,279720,22488024,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,Aythadis,"This is quite possibly one of my favorite games I've played in a LONG time. I never even knew this game existed till I stumbled upon it on the store for 90% off ($0.93 CAN.) Frankly any game out there that lets me play as a mother f***ing Dragon is usually always an instant purchase, as games like that are far and few between, and sadly most of them are not that good either. This one happens to be a mixed bag. This game does suffer from problems, and I will explain.This game is old, 2004. There hasn't been any work on updating this by the Devs, as according to the forums, the Devs don't have the source files. Thankfully though some loyal fans have made some patches to fix problems, like the music not playing, the intro movie not playing, not being able to change controls, slightly improving the graphics, etc. I've played both the normal and patched versions. I never experienced any crashes as stated by other people.My main gripe with it was the controls. This was the main reason why I never actually finished the game. I got tired trying to fight with the controls. The fan patch does help improve them, but I still found myself fighting with them when fighting harder enemies in the later stages of the game.In terms of the gameplay, you are a dragon. You fly around, using your attacks and spells to kill monsters and spawners, gain XP to level up to upgrade your stats and learn new attacks/spells, collect gems to gain more power to learn more spells, grab enemies and devour them, and f*** s*** up! There really isn't much for variety in anything though. You go to an area, kill everything, move onto the next, repeat. Some people may not like that at all.You have a selection of 3 types of dragons. Fire, Ice, and Acid. Each one has different starting stats, and a variety of different kinds of attacks/spells. Everything from Fireball, Ice storm, to summoning zombie minions, and even opening a giant fissure in the ground to kill your enemies! Each Dragon class also plays slightly differently as well. The Fire Dragon being the big Tank/Damage dealer, getting up close and smashing enemies with Fire based attacks. The Ice Dragon being more like a Sniper/Mage class with Ice/slowing attacks to freeze or take them out from a distance. The Acid Dragon being a Necromancer with Acid based attacks causing DOTS and summoning zombies to take the focus off of you.Now in terms of actually flying and battling, is very awkward. You move around by clicking where you want to fly, and your dragon to fly to the beacon you placed. Then attacking enemies you have to select a spell, and either click or click and hold to power up the spell. Most spells though will cause you to stop before actually attacking, causing you to attack then trying to move to avoid being hit. This tend to make the game feel very awkward for me, and kind of why I never completely finished the game.I played the game for about 8 hours before I added in the Fan-made patches. I highly recommend adding the patches.Pros:- You are a god damn mother f***ing Dragon!- Lots of good attacks/spells to use, that feel powerful to use.- Leveling system is simple to use.- Audio/Music sound great.- Has a much needed Tutorial.- Steam Trading Cards.Cons:- Very outdated graphics.- Controls are bad.- Audio/Video problems.- Extremely repetitive.- **Requires Fan-made Patches to make the game better.**- No achievements.If you can look past the problems, it can be a good game. Not perfect, but GOOD. When in doubt, get it on sale!6/10I will say though, because of this game it made me realize something. We NEED a new Dragon game!"

Why? Dragon here is not a mount, its a main character, and really - powerful main character. Just killing machine, rather slow, so no fancy maneuvering, but it's big, killing machine. What about summoning great vulcano (one of endgame spells) right into enemy forces? What about building entire cities (thanks for artifacts) in 10 seconds (and that is actual game, not cutscene)? Gameplay may be repetitive after certain point, but i think this game should not be considered only as action rpg, but also as hack and slash, and thats another plus - h'n's with dragon instead of guy with his sword? Yup. Also, world is quite interesting, many different biomes, creatures (design of some monsters reminds me of Sacrifice - great titile btw, by reminds me i mean not direct similarities, rather general style, that there is something unique), characters, quite big maps even for modern standards (because they are open, no endless lanes or canyons like in drakan series, for example). Another + for progression system, for example: expanding mana is cheaper for ""mage"" dragon and more expensive for warrior; many, many spells/abilities to learn (different trees, depends on your character class), also dragon will change his own looks (from time to time) - how? that depends on which stats you focus.

So I really recommend this game to all but especially to people that love dragons."

The default controls don't work well, and using a program such as Joy To Key won't help because the controls are already partially mapped (unsuccessfully) to a game controller. The game allows you to remap the keys... except that it doesn't actually work. The game doesn't save your changes.But, worst of all, the game crashes almost constantly. I finally gave up on remapping the keys and tried to make do with the sub-optimal default key assignment, only to find myself booted out of the game and staring at an error message window roughly once every 1-2 minutes of gameplay.I really wanted to like this one because it brought back fond memories of the CD-ROM version.

At first I was either going to trade or sell the voucher, since it was indeed tradable, but my interest was peaked and I took a look at it. Not caring much for Action-RPGs, I was still inclined to sell it, but I decided adding a new game to my collection would be nice and it was a steal at only 70 cents with the coupon. Little did I know I'd find an obscure gem.This game has become one of my favourite old-school story-based games within the first hours of playing. It was a little repetative, yes; and the controls did irritate at times, always going backwards because a tree or hill was in the way and such, but it was really fun. There were a few sections in which I had the down the difficulty because it got quite extreme; being killed in one hit as theWarlord and Cultist, but overall the difficulty curb was nice and smooth.The voice acting was complete garbage, no sugar coating that. This was 2004, however, and I can give it a pass for that, especially since the low quality voice acting in this game actually is far better than a few select games I've seen from 2014-15.I played the Fire Dragon, as I always play a tank character in RPG games. It was a fun experiance, burning things and getting close combat in with the many monsters. The gorillas with homing shots did irritate me, but after level grinding a bit through invasions I could take them. By far my favourite part wasthe final battle against Skarborr because with the column spell I managed to launch him all the way across the map, which I found highly amusing as he'd fall back down floating and changing direction incredibly quickly, obviously annoyed.Can't really think of much else to say. I didn't find the low quality graphics annoying, since I'm used to early 2000's games like Age Of Empires. I just found it fun and I'll probably do a run as the other two dragon classes once I get some more free time. If you have a few extra dollars, I'd suggest this game."

I used to play it a lot when I was younger, and I'm glad Steam got their hands on it so hopefully it'll be fixed of it's problems. The dragon mechanics are some of the better ones I've seen in gaming, not the greatest, but it has good things going for it. The options aren't the greatest, and there are some glaring problems, but thankfully the main game can still be played pretty well now that it's been updated to the recent OS's.The game play itself is pretty simple, mass monster genocide and kill the evil baddie at the end while making sure humans don't blow themselves up or stab you in the back. The story isn't revolutionary, and has some... glaring issues, like a lack of a real moral choice. *Spoilers* Even after the king turns and tries to kill you, and you find a level 4 city that is turned evil, in which the gypsy even says 'no wonder dragons hate humans', you still fight along side them. Why? Because GAME LOGIC! The game itself is still good, and one of it's greatest points is it's spells. It brings an interesting choice for skill points, spend some to get a new spell, or level up stats. And unlike some games, the cost remains the same for all spells, with only a level limit for the spells. Meaning you don't have to get a bunch of level 1 spells just to get that huge level 15 spells. Most of the time I ignore the spells until around level 20 because that's when things start getting good.If you want to play as a dragon, blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, and feel like a true bad♥♥♥♥♥of the sky by tearing up a bunch of monsters, then I recommend you play this. It has problems, but I think the game itself is very good once you get things situated.

Those who had the disc copy would know that. I had, and surprisingly still do, have my original disk copy (I had thought I lost it which is why I bought it on here). The gameplay is still the same, but the original intro that plays at the start up of the game is changed and cut dramaticly. You can find the original, in full english, on youtube still which tells much more story than this one does. And also, the land is called Nimoan. There's a second N in there. Shows how much it has been changed...But I digress, the game is still marvelous and while some features have changed (minor but I still would prefer them the old way) it is still a great game for anyone who would like to pick it up and give it a whirl. For the crashing issues, it hasn't crashed on me once. I tried getting the graphic patch and I had to find something to fix it because the game wouldn't start then. But other than that and the intro not actually playing, I've had no issues with the game as of yet on my potato of a computer (lol).For Dragon lovers, give this game a shot. It'll be worth your time."

I love the fact that you are a dragon and you can aim your breath powers to destroy buildings and creatures. I enjoyed playing it for a while.There is a major problem going on with it, though. for some reason, every major level-up the whole game crashes and starts from the level before. i dont understand why its doing this. i rebooted my computer and re-loaded the game but it still crashes. if someone knows what's going on, please tell me. I would like to play all the way through this game."

,Recommended,279720,29797121,Posted: 9 February,all,entwineddragonsfac,"I of the Dragon is an interesting game. As other dragon lovers know, its nearly impossible to find good 3D dragon games where you actually are the dragon. It is an old game(2004) so please have patience with the graphics. I've played this game nearly non-stop till I completely finished it(28 hours), so I'll tell you the pros and cons straight up.Cons.1) Its old. So it has a hard time working with newer computers.2) Every time you open the game, it plays an annoying clip of the backstory. Just click to surpass it.3) Every time you level up, the game halts for a second and may want to close the program. I have a very good computer meant for digital art and gaming so it tried to overload it but couldn't. Your computer may not be able to handle it. Its ok, just open the game again and continue like normal.4) The game controls are annoying being forced to use the arrow keys and not WASD. I'm right handed so it hurt my wrist after awhile to play at that angle. Other than that, using the mouse etc is pretty easy to learn and get used to.5) For some variety, they give you a quest in the position of another character (only 2 or 3 times). If you die, which you most likely will, it will take you back to your last save point. So you have to complete the quest AGAIN as the dragon that lead to the subquest, then do the subquest again. Till you complete it. My advice, wait to complete the quest till AFTER you level up so it goes to that save point instead of way back.6) Dont try to change controls in option tab. Does no good whatsoever. It never saves your new settings no matter what.7) You never get help. You the dragon ""The Savior"" do everything by yourself. Which is okay. It doesn't get old.8) The targeting system can be a bit irritating sometimes but youll get used to it and know how to work around/with it.9) Once you finish the final boss battle, its sad that the game doesn't allow you to keep playing and flying and fighting enemies just cause. Once the battle ends, that's end game. No more. At all. Unless you start a new game.Pros.1) Its fudging awesome. The dragon is awesome. The gameplay is awesome (though the graphics are obviousy 2004). Being a dragon buff, structure, ability, flight physics, etc is all so important to me and its the best I've seen.2) Flying is great. Its so smooth and controlled. I spent time just flying around because I could.3) Even though you have to do some grinding to level up, its still fun and doesn't get old. There's new places and new monsters to destroy all the time.4) The leveling up system is nice. You get plenty of points to pass around nicely and the leveling up doesnt seem too far apart. Its not like once you reach such a high levl thats its impossile to keep leveling up. (I reached level 58).5) You can choose from three different dragons. Fire Dragon, Mage Dragon, and Necromancer I think. I always love the original straight power of the fire dragon. I can't tell you about the other two. The choice is nice.6) The power matches the dragon. Neither one(dragon or enemy) gets overpowered throughout the game and runs together nicely.7) Endless monsters really and the great feeling of accomplishment when you finally demolish them all(In that area).8) Variety of monsters is great. Especially because each one has a secret on how to defeat it easiest.9) The different areas you can go to have similarities but are all differnt. Each one is a completely different map with a difference in mountains, desert, forest, plains, tundra, and a mix of each.10) There is a constant story. You're never left without a direction to go(unless you just feel like wandering around instead of finishing the quest). There is no time limit on quests. Dowhat you want, when you want.Overall, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. I would support a remake or makeover (better graphics etc) 100%. Every dragon lover would love this. I would LOVE a new version or a sequel or any thing else really. So worth the money spent. I cannot express that enough. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The pros SO heavily outweigh the cons. So worth it.Tips for Playing:1) When I first started playing, the controls wouldn't let me turn at the same time I flew forward. On the front screen where you play, in the bottom right there are a couple buttons. Scroll over them to display the name of what they do. Right above the pause button is the gamespeed level. Put the game speed to maximum and you'll be able to fly with perfect control.2) Don't destroy ALL lairs. Leave one, two max. So you can grind or make sure to complete a quest.3) Wait to do the last step of a quest till AFTER you level up. So if you die, which you will, you will go back to your last save point instead of way back so youd have to do everything all over again.4) Each creature has a way to kill it. The dragonfly things, you have to get right on their flight level and chase them. Never stop moving. Their attack is so fast that if you stop, you'll get hit ten times in .5 seconds. Etc. Just an example.5) Fly around the edge of the map of a new area and level up after so if you die, you have the whole map still discovered. Fly as high as you can if you don't want to be bothered by monsters. They may still try to attack, but they won't hit you or gang up on you to attack.6) When starting a new town, clear all the lairs nearby so they don't immediately destroy the town. Another tip. If you think the town can handle itself and you go to destroy lairs, remember to only destroy a couple lairs at a time, because the monsters without a lair to defend will immediately go to attack the town and will overload the town. So destroy a couple, go back to town and defend it, etc.7) Even if you're a fire dragon based in straight power, DO NOT ignore your magic. The monsters get strong enough that if  you stop for a bit to destroy a lair, you'll get hit so many times you die. Use your magic abilities to fly over, destroy a lair, and run. Return and pick off the monsters one by one. Don't bother with mana inflow. Just life, regen, power, etc.8) There are pretty much NO walkthroughs. I only found one. You'll probably find the same one. Ignore the youtube ones. Go to the one on a website and is in just basic text. It doesn't go to the end of the game, but it goes far enough to help you where you need it.9) GRIND. GRIND. GRIND. Destroy all but one lair in each area. After towns are built, lairs won't form, but when you destroy everything but one, you'll never be low on power.10) Dn't kill the little guys on carpets. They help you.11) In settings, set the game difficulty to level3, not 5. Level 5 is impossily hard and irritating,That's all I can think of right now. Awesome game. If you have any other questions etc, feel free to message me on my steam account. I'll help you as best I can."

Otherwise the game won't run.So what's this game about? You pick one of three dragons: a glass cannon blue, a musclebrain red or the unkillable black, and set out to cleanse the world of monsters and kill an evil lord. Oh and save the humanity too, I guess. My favourite way to play this is to dial down the difficulty and just destroy everything while being nearly invulnerable. It's a nice relaxing power fantasy. Except for the few levels where they force you to play as slow fragile humans in a world meant to be flown over.There are problems with this game no doubt. It is ugly, even considering it's age, the aforementioned human levels, which are seriously a pain, the voice-acting is laughable, the mysterious old man that gives instructions and exposition has the tendency to appear at some rather unfortunate moments. The gameplay is repetitive, but the game is too short to get bored with it.So why do I recomment it? Because it's a game where you fly around maps as a dragon and destroy monsters which are tiny compared to you. It's awesome and every time I finish a playthrough I want to start another one."
