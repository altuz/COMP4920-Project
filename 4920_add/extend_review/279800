,Recommended,279800,21876887,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,Faudraline,"Grim Legendshas easily become one of my favorite Artifex Mundi series, with a theme centering around Brothers Grimm Fairytale collection. Each new game is an original and beautiful interpretation of one of their collected European fairytales. Thus, there is no story consistency between games in the series. You can pick and enjoy them as stand-alones. Being a lovely interpretation ofThe Six Swansstory,Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swanis no different.Here, we take the role of a healer, brought in to the Eagle Kingdom to find a solution to the young and beautiful Queen's unknown ailment. She has never spoken a word for the years that she has passed with her beloved King; not even after the birth of their son. According to Queen Mother - the Peacock Lady - all she ever does is weaving shirts out of nettle without ever resting. As we just start to examine the young Queen, a sinister green smoke breaks into her chamber, engulfing her and the heir. When the smoke is gone, so is the heir. The Peacock Lady steadily accuses the Young Queen with witchcraft - punishable by burning at the stake as the laws of the land dictate. Suspicious of this accusation, the King pleads with us to find a way to prove her innocence. So, our journey towards the Swan Kingdom - the homeland of the Queen - in hopes of finding proof of her innocence begins. We are to learn of an old tragedy, unmask the real villain and break a curse while we are at it.Maybe not as dramatic or impressive as the first game,Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swanis still a beautiful interpretation of the original tale and a well-made addition to the series. Artworks are trademark Artifex Mundi at this point: vibrant, appealing and picturesque. Character designs themselves are quite fitting for the tale, with thriving animations, mimics and color choices. Voice acting is not spectacular, but still well above average. Whenever I write about one of these HOGs hailing from Artifex Mundi, I feel like working on a paying advertisement; but I swear that's not the case. Their work in these silly casual games is nearly always that good, that's all.Gameplay though, is a bit sterile in this one compared to other Artifex Mundi games. We don't have as many HOG scenes as we'd expect. The game is dominated by FROG - Fragmented Object Games - where you are expected to collect pieces of a certain item to make a whole, then use as a part of another item combination. Puzzles are fine - nothing shallow or suicidal, just the right amount of brain scratching, if not a bit basic. Compared to other titles, there is a fair amount of backtracking too, so be ready to recall details from past environments if you are playing in expert difficulty. There is domino or mahjong alternative gameplay here, since there isn't much HOG scenes to alternate between anyhow so one playthrough would be suffice for collecting all achievements.By the end, this second instalment in the series, is a beautiful game appropriate for a lazy midweek afternoon. Grab it on sale and admire some beautiful artwork accompanied by a neat selection of puzzles and an enchanting retelling of a Grimm Brothers story.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

The game is based on the popular fairy tale ""The Wild Swans"" by Handersen, and features gorgeous backgrounds, beautiful music and an engaging story, as well as excellent voice acting. As a bonus, you'll get companions like a bird, a fairy and a cute otter :3Even though it's part of the ""Grim Legends"" series, it works as a stand alone game so you don't really need to play the first one (which is a pleasant game too).I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a relaxing, cozy adventure game8/10"

The tone is darker, with much more death; there's no single cute helper; the familiar ""find the object OR play the game"" is swapped out for smaller hunts. The music isn't quite as atmospheric and the sense of mystery and discovery is swapped out for, well, an actual mystery you  have to solve. Having to meet more people and talk to them changes the sense of isolation and exploration from the first game. There's less exploring a new world and more unraveling the past. Is it better? Depends on what you want.Also I have to say it: that face in the one hidden object game came off as a little, um. Racist?"
,Recommended,279800,15234066,"Posted: 6 April, 2015",all,Erbkaiser,"On its own, this is a good hidden object game. Puzzles are detailed and beautiful, the storyline is well worked out and, while lifting on a well-known fairytale, still has twists.All screens are partially animated, making the world feel alive, and the cinematic scenes are the developer's best work yet.Compared to its predecessor however, Grim Legends 2 disappoints a little. Voice acting is of a lesser quality, with even cases where the subtitles and voice dialogue don't match.Gameplay wise, there is only one kind of optional collectable to the previous games' two kinds, and you can no longer opt out of a hidden object puzzle for another kind of game: you now only have the option to use the hint button instead.Fortunately both have standalone stories, so you won't necessarily need to buy ""2"" for story reasons.Good is that the companion idea from the previous game returns, with now not just one critter helping you, but a new one per chapter. They are also used more, and feel more relevant to the story.There is also more variation in the puzzles this time than just combine A with B or slide puzzles, so there is less idea of repetition here. You also backtrack less than in Grim Legends 1.Overall Grim Legends 2 is a polished game well worth playing, but I feel more could have been done with it to make it a proper sequel to the first game. Taking it as a standalone though, I can definitely recommend it."

It's got a beautiful setting, and a fun story. The puzzles and hidden object games are well done. And it's got both polish and heart. I love the company that makes these games, and they seem to keep getting better at what they do.As with the other Artifex Mundi games, I'd highly recommend this one to anyone interested in puzzles, hidden object games, and original stories. Plus, no need to play the first game to enjoy this one."

And I will recommend them for anyone that want to experience the old kind of folk narratives, as that is what the story reminds me of the most. (Fairy Tales, Moral stories, legends.) While the game plays and feel mostly the same, I think it is an improvement from the first one.The game is in first person, but unlike the first game it doesn't really bother me so much here. Since the protagonist is known as the ""healer"" and doesn't have a preexisting relationship with any of the characters, so while her profession is given she is pretty much a blank slate. (Personally still prefer most games in third person, but unlike the first game, I think the first person works here.)The story is easy to follow and the puzzles are mostly enjoyable. This time the story fits the slower puzzle solving gameplay better than the first one, as the threats to the characters aren't presented to be as immediate as they were in the first game. So it makes sense that you work slowly to uncover the story. It is more the: “We need this done as soon as possible!” As opposed to some moments of the first one: “We need to do this NOW or we will die!”The characters are easily identifiable and not very complex, but that fits well with the genre of story that is told in the game. As it is more about telling an enchanting tale, rather than how the characters experience the events. So you will be most likely able to guess who the evil one is before it is revealed just from clichés in old stories, but the story is still cute and charming. I won’t replay it, but I don’t regret buying or playing it."

It has a real intense story, with even some twists, while at the same time providing a lot of mini games and puzzles. The puzzels mostly fit nicely into the story, which is quite seldom the case. The minigames are varying quite nicely. Beside of some of the hidden object minigames, none is the same as another (sometimes there is more than one of the same time in a sequence). Even the hidden object minigames are varying, which is really great.But the element that really keeps one to continue this game is how everything is driven by the story.  The story is provided with small cutscenes and short dialoges. But also by some of the minigames or other things one just discoveres. All those scenes are short enough, so that I never was tempted to skip them. (You get an archivement for not skipping the first ones.)Last but not least I liked both the graphic and the music. Both added to the atmosphere of the game."

I really enjoyed this take on The Six Swans fairy tale, and the art was lovely as always. The weakest link is always the voice acting, and some of it is fine while some of it is cringeworthy. If you like HOGs, you really can't go wrong with an Artifex Mundi title. Can't wait for Grim Legends 3!"

The puzzles were tougher than I expected and it was quite a challenge ( especially in order to get all the achievements! )I would've loved a story a little more detailed... It seemed like there was alot of elements and at some point I wasn't sure where all the chapters were leading me or it was really vague, leaving me confused...Again, Artifex gives us beautiful graphic and drawings and this time the narration was much more better than other Artifex's games I played. I had a great time playing it and I recommend this to anybody who loves point and click games !"

Usually finish most of the puzzles by myself, but this one seems to have some really messed up puzzles. One you had some missing rectangle stone pieces, couldn't find them anywhere. Well, they were the round small stone pieces (2 of 2) that had collected earlier. Don't remember them doing this in any other game so far. There was at least one other puzzle that bothered my sanity like that.  So didn't enjoy the puzzles that much in this one, in Grim Legends 1 did.Really liked the story though, probably one of the best so far.Another note: this game uses Dominoes instead of Mahjong, so only did the HOS in here."

The art, the voice acting, the story, the atmosphere is always on point.This is one of their newest releases and it shows! Every time they release a new game the art of the animations gets smoother and more real. Because, let’s face it, there are many HOGs that have great art overall, but when it comes to the animation parts… it’s usually a little wonky.  I’m so happy to say that AM manages to improve with each game they release.I also really like that the HOG parts of the game itself are not just lists of items you should look for, but also little images of the items you need instead of the words. I’m a fan of the genre, but too many grocery shopping lists in crowded screens gets a little boring sometimes.The puzzles in Grim Legends 2 are nothing too hard, though two managed to get me stuck at least 30 minutes each. The difficulty varies from ‘Seeing The Answer Right Away’ to, ‘I’m Just Pressing Random Buttons’ to, ‘I’ll Turn On My Brain Now For Some Serious Thinking’.There’s also no need to have played Grim Legends 1 for story purposes, there are achievements all around and you can actually carry the baby. No carrying babies around in inventories, aww yeah."

However, the gameplay was very similiar and so I could finish the game faster than the first one.Secondly, The story was interesting, especially it was unpredictable. Every time you thought you had understand what's happening, there was a sudden turn and then you were totally clueless as on the beginning. You really have to play the game until the end to understand the whole story.The only bad point about the game is the too short ending. To be honest, I expected more like the ending of ""Grim Legends 1"" and not that kind of short and cheesy one.Last but not least, the bonus part was very funny and nice to play,even when it wasn't a proceeding or flashback of the main story. It was just a funny and short part where you could play a little longer in this world after you had finished the main one."

76561198045208825,Recommended,279800,19171248,"Posted: 20 November, 2015",all,Shatiz,"SummaryDecent HOG and puzzle game with a middling story and good mechanics. Good for a few hours of fun if you enjoy the genre.ReviewYou play as the Healer, summoned to the Eagle Kingdom by the Eagle King to cure his nameless mute wife, the mother of his nameless son. Nameless sinister forces are at work however and make your task a great deal harder as the son is kidnapped, the wife accused of magic use (illegal by the decree of the otherwise nameless Peacock Queen, the Eagle King’s mother). Overall I found the story pretty bland and not as enjoyable as Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride. There is very few twists and for the most part it is just good vs evil. The voice acting is mostly poor and the “characters” are incredibly one-dimensional – in case you had missed it, not a single person in the game even has a name. Hell, the wife’s nickname from one of her forest friends is “little P” for little princess. Lazy.Still, the game looks good and mechanically it is fine. Nothing really inventive or super challenging, but decent variety of HOGS and puzzles. So I would say it is good for a few hours of relaxing HOGing (I finished both the main story and the extra chapter in about 6.6 hours on Expert difficulty and with all achievements), but if you are looking for a challenge, inventive puzzles or a compelling story… look elsewhere."

The story is a retelling of a fairy tale with many variants where a sister must rescue her brothers from swan form by making shirts of nettles. Since I'm a sucker for fairy tale retellings, this automatically gave it plenty of credit in my eyes despite the overly expository intro.As far as game mechanics are concerned, I really liked that they had a bottle that glowed if you hadn't found the collectible on that screen yet. I only wish that was a feature they had continued using in successive games. Instead of just one animal helper like in the first game, you had three helpers depending on location who make a noise to indicate when there's a task they can help with.The music wasn't quite as good as the first game, but I did like how they used feathers instead of just sparkling to indicate hidden object scenes. Little details like that can really make a game.There are several cute and unique minor characters that are surprisingly well-developed for such a short game. Some of these characters make appearances in both the main adventure as well as in the prequel bonus adventure.Despite a couple of inevitable idiosyncratic moments, this is a quality hidden object puzzle adventure game that is well worth adding to your inventory."

On one hand, Artifex Mundi (AM) has improved their Achievements so they aren't mutually exclusive.  In other words, we're not forced to make two run throughs to get all Achievements (yay!).  Also, the graphics seem to be a bit sharper and brighter than earlier games.  On the other hand, the voice acting is much worse than normal.  Some of the voice acting is on par with other AM games (i.e., tolerable).  But, the queen's voice acting is bad and the various children's voice acting is utterly horrible.  I cringed every time I had to click on those kids and listen to their ""acting.""  Ugh.  To go along with the bad voice acting, the story is even worse than usual for these casual adventure Hidden Object games (HOGs).  So, instead of an OK-cutesy story, this one tends towards the OK-silly side.  If it weren't for the dead bodies lying around, I'd even lean towards it being written for kids (especially in the Bonus Chapter).  I'd also like to mention that even though this game is classified as a HOG, most of the puzzles are NOT technically HOGs:  they're FROGs (Fragmented/Fractured Object Game).  Plus, most of the HOGs are of the type where you have to find a bunch of fairies or a bunch of flowers and not of the type where you have a hodgepodge of various items hidden among other miscellany.  Of course, that could be good or bad, depending on your tastes.Unfortunately, I didn't properly record my actual game play time.  So, I can't give the exact duration of the game.  But, it took me about 8 hours to finish the whole thing with 100% Achievements:  a little over 6 hours for the main game and 1.7 hours for the Bonus Chapter.  So, with the pluses and minuses noted above, coupled with the slightly short game play, I'm recommending the game.  But, only if you can find it on sale.  I'd say you should buy it if you can find it for less than six dollars."

Yes, I know it's not real, but that doesn't mean I want to see it....ever.

,Recommended,279800,18869739,"Posted: 3 November, 2015",all,nerdfury,"Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swanis a casual point and click adventure game set in a fantasy/fairy tale world. For adventure gamers who aren't particularly fond of hidden object scenes, I have pleasant news, as hidden object scenes in Grim Legends 2 occur very occasionally. The bulk of the gameplay consists of exploration, inventory-based puzzles, and a large variety of puzzle mini-games, and I found myself being constantly impressed by how refreshing the mini-game selection was. I play a LOT of point and click adventure games (or HOPAs) and consider myself to be very picky within this genre, however, I never felt like I had a dull moment exploring the beautiful and immersive world of Grim Legends 2. The storyline is a bit cheesy, but that's OK, as some characters were memorable and lovable, and the artwork and music was of a very high-quality. I think what stood out most to me in this game was how beautiful the scenery was.Keep in mind that this is a Collector's Edition (this fact isn't mentioned on the Steam store page). This means that aside from the main game/story, there's also a (much smaller) bonus game/story, as well as goodies to include wallpapers, concept art and re-playable hidden object mini-games. The main game as well as the bonus game took me about 4 hours to complete on Expert mode, so you can expect a similar amount of gameplay hours if you're familiar with point and click games.TLDR: Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan is a well-made point and click adventure game, with a variety of enjoyable puzzles, lovely artwork and music, adequate voice acting, and a storyline that isn't too remarkable.I would recommend it (on sale) to anyone who enjoys point and click adventure games, particularly those who enjoy fantasy settings. It's an excellent game for young children who have demonstrated interest in fairy tales, too."

There is occassionally a hidden object puzzle, but not nearly as many as I was expecting.  It was a good pace, the art was great, and there wasn't any point at which I was really stumped.  More to the point, I was able to find all of the objects within a couple of rooms, and never felt like I was wandering all over the place trying to pixel hunt.The story was interesting to follow, though obvious to where it was going.  Most of the voice acting was pretty good -- at least compared to other casual games I've played.  There was only one or two characters (younger boys) that I was taken out of the game by.One minor note.. if you have a tablet, the games seem to be quite a bit cheaper there ($5 versus $10), but the steam sales can get down a bit further if you watch for them."

They can make any basic story sound interesting with good storytelling, having few plot twists, good puzzles and with really amazing background art. The pros of their games is making the most simple stories interesting and memorable but always having a high quality in their games. The cons are that these games are like Undertale; you get the most fun and delight when you don't know anything about it. Later on it's nice to replay it few times but it doesn't have the same charm anymore. But this game has something that just makes it better when you replay it few times. I played this game twice and the story made lots of more sense.This game isn't sequel to earlier Grim Legends-game, the Forsaken bride; it's just an another tale and another story in distant country far away.The story is quite decent for HOG game; something bad happens and player has to solve the problem and also seek the truth which lead to horrific events. Basic day. But Artifex Mundi gives live to this story with intriguing backstory which in my opinion sounded realistic.The puzzles are not hard but they might take time depending, how accustomed HOG player you're.The voice acting is good too, quite good for HOG game. The voices have personality and I have to admit that I still remember clearly the nasal voice of the Peacock queenand the rough and hoarse voice of the Swan king.The art has personality and looks nicely rough and the background looks slightly twisted in my opinion, contrast to the bright colors and prettiness. It makes the game more memorable but also gives the feeling that the world is alive and breathing when our protagonist is on the adventure.The music also is really pretty but not something that really stays in mind.There's a main game but also a bonus game but the main games story is much more well thought than the bonus. It just gave me the feeling that Artifex Mundi had to add some kind of bonus story so the CE wouldn't feel waste for the buyers. But it is still enjoyable if you don't think it too much.And personally I would have liked to that bonus was small prequel or sequel of the main story than another story in Swan queens perspective.It's good game with basic story where you solve the mystery of mysterious events. It's one of the best Artifex Mundi games they have made for awhile and for it's high quality in art, story and possible the collectibles you can say that you haven't wasted you money in vain. If you're still thinking should you buy this use your extra money to it when you wan't to just sit down and have fun or buy it when it's on sale. This game is a good introduction on the Hidden object genre and on the Artifex Mundi games.The pros:- gorgeous art- basic story with an twist- memorable voice acting- realistic characters- replay possibilityThe cons:- needs more than one play through to enjoy properly- slightly linear story- predictable"

The voice-overs and story coherence were above par, IMO (though it's clear from the beginning who the villain is).

There were a few ""what the HELL just happened?"" moments for me (specifically, the tree with the acorn in its mouth, the arrow stuck in a tree, and collecting the evil snail's slime).HO scenes: they are overall quite easy, but many of them follow the pattern which is seemingly more common in games from Big Fish: the items collected in such scene combine to build up the item you end up getting after the scene. (i prefer this approach over searching for many random items and keeping one of them afterwards.) Some reviewers complain about the abstract shapes of some of the HO items, but that's clearly a matter of taste. Yes, they DO make the HO scenes more difficult, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ambiguous search terms in HO scenes are relatively common (e.g. looking for a ""face"" when there are at least 3 faces in the scene), but i've seen much worse.Good pacing, though, combined with nice voices and lovely scenery, make this a nice casual HOPA.Gotta thumb this up."

Anyway, I highly recommened playing this game if you're willing to use your teeny tiny brain and solve puzzles. Have a good day."

Always flawless play, a good and dramatic story with nice music and graphics. I am seeing some puzzles being used over again, but I'll guess that is fine. Recognizing them and understanding them isn't so bad. You know what you get when you play these games.Some of the earlier games required you to complete the game more than once to get all achievements. I even had to play the first one in this serie a third time (did not complete the third time). All though the fact that I had to replay maybe 15 minutes of this game after completing it did not bother me.I like these games, and how you proceed in them, but rushing on through the entire game to get some forgotten things is not that fun. Thumbs up that they made it this way!"
,Recommended,279800,32113650,Posted: 1 June,all,Bob,I’ve played so many Artifex Mundi games now I have come to have a pretty good idea of what to expect and this lived up to my expectations. This is one of their more polished creations. Great artwork and hidden object scenes with solid puzzles connected together with a reasonable story. The only downsides were the voice actors for the children and there were more of the hidden object puzzles where you have to find items which match the pictures at the bottom of the screen as opposed to the ones where you find items off a list. But despite that if you like hidden object games this is well worth a play.

The puzzles were not too difficult but the game was still enjoyable to play. I played this on Linux using the open source Radeon drivers on Ubuntu 17.04 and had zero issues with the game. The story was decent and I found I wanted to learn more of it as the game progressed.If you're into these casual Hidden Object Games this one is worth while to pick up and play through.
