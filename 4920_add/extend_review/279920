It's pretty fun, and addictive enough that I completed the story mode in one go and then played through the hard and arcade modes until some real-life errands dragged me away. Normally for a game this short I'd say the price is a bit high, but it's a game based around being fast, so. It also has to be commended for having a silly premise but making it work by playing it straight; way too many games start with a wacky idea and then constantly push it with zany humour until you're sick of the entire thing.The flaws obviously weren't enough to stop me playing, but they're worth noting: I don't think a game like this really needs a lives system, it would probably be enough just to dock your score when you die. There were a few rare instances where I failed to dodge an obstacle and kind of just clipped through it instead, which was helpful but probably something that might need fixing. The biggest flaw for me was that the voice actor (there's really only one with a speaking role) runs through her lines faster than a werewolf through a spaceship. Better voice direction would really have helped there, towards the end I was beginning to suspect they'd shot the cutscenes before they recorded the dialogue and panicked when they realised they weren't long enough to get out what little plot the game has."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was fun to play.  Its kinda entertaining to just go through in Arcade mode and see how long it takes me to faceplant into a wall by failing to make a turn in time (or, more embarassingly, turning the wrong way), while trying to keep myself from accidentally jumping face-first into the obstacles I'm supposed to be sliding under.The Quick Time Events, which normally annoy the hell out of me, didn't do that in this game, well, except for that one fight at the end.  Though, really, I think the game would have been better with more werewolf in it."

Took me 90 minutes to complete this game which amazed me. The game is VERY short. but it was pretty fun time I must sayThough...The Final Part of the game is CHEAP. There is no Combat in this game it is all QTE's (Quick Time Events) and the final area is only that. and this game is very picky. so if you hit one wrong key BOOM..Restart. and you try again, but of course losing all your lives will force a restart on the entire final stage again just to retry that frustrating final encounter.So overall I liked the game, but that final area really got to me after retrying the level a few times to actually pass it. for the sale price I got it for ($2.99) its really not bad."

I can however rate it on its gameplay.I find Infinity runner is a game best entered with few expectations. It promises pretty much what you think it does. Its a first person action running simulator.That said, its an on rails obstical course with an interesting twist. The werewolves in space theme allows you to turn into a hulking werewolf mid-run, and change many of the rules in your favor, as it should. The combat in the game (yes, it has combat) is in the form of QTEs depending on the position and number of enemies in a room. If you succeed the challenge, you are rewarded with a smash and kill style fight as your avatar kills everyone in the room and continues to run at break neck speeds.Yes, you are running at break neck speeds as any failure to react correctly to the environment as it explodes around you is an instant death. Thankfully you as a player are barely penalised, as you are almost immediately put back into sonic speeds at revival.I rate this game highly because I believe it accomplised its goal almost entirely. I found myself glued to the screen, not trying to contemplate what was going on in the world, but instead reacting to my immediate environment. Each level brings its own style of obsticals, from literally jumping through space to sliding under gunships as they lay fire down on my naked body.I wouldn't play this game for the lore, but why would you? This is a game meant to be played for about 20 minutes at a time, and is very satisfying as that. RUN!"

However i still say this is a good game. Why? becaues when it works it is good fun, its got very streamline gameplay and the story while very low on answers does give you enough to make you intrested in how it continues. Overall its a fairly good game with enough bugs to make one very mad, Id still recomend it though cause if you work around them it is a fun game"

76561197995105285,Recommended,279920,17213410,"Posted: 24 July, 2015",all,non.horation,"Infinity Runner is (as you've probably guessed) an endless runner where the gimmick is that you're playing a werewolf IN SPACE. There's a bit of a story but it's pretty sparse and really an excuse to get to the running. Overall I found the running really fun. The backdrops are all pretty interesting in a sort of pulp sci-fi way (though sometimes on your first run it's hard to tell how to navigate some of the obstacles).There is a lives system where you can die a certain amount of times and go back to a previous checkpoint rather than having to restart. The lives system seemed a bit unnecessary and I think I would have preferred (at least for story mode) to have infinite lives and just go back to the last checkpoint every time and maybe lose some points or something. Combat is executed by QTEs and the final boss fight killed me enough times that I had to restart the level a few times and that was a bit irritating.Running feels great and navigating obstacles without losing momentum is super fun, but the mouse/keyboard controls can be a bit awkward. The game might feel a bit smoother with a controller.The arcade mode is a true endless runner where you run through the different sections of the ship until you run out of lives, and I think that's where the game really shines. In arcade mode you can choose to turn combat off if you'd prefer to not have to deal with the QTEs.There is a multiplayer mode of some kind but I didn't try it so I don't have an opinion on it."

76561198168837759,Recommended,279920,13931076,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Sacatuki,"I enjoyed the fast paced parkour style of gameplay that it offered and the well done voice acting. Not to mention the out of the ordinary concept of werewolves in space. I also enjoyed that there was plenty of obstacles to overcome by various methods such as sliding, quick time fighting sequences, jumping, and ziplining in human form and climbing on walls, crushing enemies with ease, and even breaking through walls in werewolf form. However, I noticed some things that I just could not brush off. For instance, after you have completed the first two sectors, your female friend in the game no longer follows along with the words that are being spoken by the voice actress. Its like she has mind of her own and it is telling her not to open her mouth. Also, there's not alot of ways to take down an oppenent. I don't expect the werewolf form to have many ways to take down an enemy (due to the fact a werewolf is a raging beast) but, I do wish the human form had more fighting styles since your main character was trained to be a deadly living weapon. The story is okay. Not the best story ever told but it does fill in the gaps (most of them anyway). The final issue I have with this game, and is also the biggest issue, is the controller support. I see most games give you more options in order to change the button layout to your own comfort level and they don't mix and match buttons in order to keep throwing you off, but that is all you ever see when you play Infinity Runner. For instance, you are given three configuration choices depending on your controller and what you feel most comfortable with: one for ps3, one for xbox, and one that is custom. The issue starts when you are in a fighting sequence against the guard when it tells you to press the press the A button, it actually means that you have to press the RB button. What!? The layout for the buttons is scattered all over thet place! When you press X, it actually means Y. When you press LT, it actually mean the start button. This was so unbearable that I had to stick with the playstation configuration becuase most of the buttons were in the right order. The only two buttons that switched places was R2 and R1, as well as L2 and L1. This was the most frustrating part of the entire game. Overall, my final verdict for this game is a 7/10. Infinity Runner is a over the top, sci-fi based, parkour simulator that has fast paced gameplay that will leave gamers wanting more of the adrenaline rush. But, there are also a ton of other issues that need to fixed right away. Otherwise this franchise will NOT reach it's full potential."

,Not Recommended,279920,11253259,"Posted: 15 July, 2014",all,Xriah,"Utter disappointment.The game concept is pretty easy to get a grasp of. Automatically run down a corridor dodging obstacles by hitting buttons at the right time. Left and Right to dodge left and right, click to jump, right click to slide, look left or right to turn down a corridor. Sounds simple enough in theory, right?You'll quickly begin to notice problems when the environment starts falling apart on you. While the asthetics are cool to look at, the different chatoic elements often leave you with no way to reasonably discern what button to hit until it's too late. It turns the game from a fun, adrenaline fueled thrill ride into a frusturating chore of trial and error.The particular bit that sticks out in my mind was where you ripline past two droids that are firing at you. The second droid gets in your way, and you have to drop off the ripline and slide under it. However, you can't slide until you've hit the ground, and it's really hard to tell when you've hit the ground in this game because of your extreme forward momentum and the first person perspective. It took several tries to figure out what percise moment to hit the button, again through trial and error.This combines with controls that just aren't responsive enough. I have a pretty good gaming PC, and I turned my quality way down, and it still felt like their was a slight delay on every button press. It wouldn't be so bad if you wern't going so fast.Another person might be able to look past these flaws and get immersed in the experience. For me, the above issues consistently ruined my immersion. If you want a good runner game, check out TEC 3001. Aside form the simpler graphics, it does everything this game does 10x better."

I could understand disdain for this if it were endless, or if there were exploitative microtransactions. This game has neither. It has a level structure, and it even has difficulty settings which affect the game in very interesting ways. Also: It's a bloody werewolf on a spaceship, you miserable old sadsack. What more could you ask for?To throw some more details into this ball of words than that -- it's similar to endless runners on the tablets, except not at all. The level structure and controls (which feel rad) make it feel very different, it's more 'inspired by.' So the end result is a game that has more in common with SkyRoads and '90s PC shareware games than it does Temple Runner. That's not a bad thing, since Temple Runner and its ilk are 'pay to keep going' games. This is a 'be good enough to keep going' game. And if you're simply awful at it, well there's an easy mode for you, too (as I mentioned!).I don't know what there is to dislike about this, really. It's aesthetically pretty, it's fun to kill a few minutes with (when you don't have much time to spare), and it's priced accordingly. I can't understand why you'd hate this other than perhaps a.) you're young and your money is limited so you want your games to last longer and thus you're very invested in the fallacy of quantity -> quality (you'll learn), or b.) you're xenophobic and you hate Welsh people and werewolves??

The gameplay consists of a string of quick time events. But it is really cool so far. What can I say? It has Werewolves! in SPACE!!(optional let's play footage) lol we all posted videos, guess I get the leftover view right? =Dhttp://youtu.be/2alrnFP6HMETip; as soon you boot up the game for the first time rebind jump to space and slide to Ctrl or your preferred FPS crouching key. You might find that you die a lot less from pressing the wrong button this way. They made some weird choices for some of the default key bindings.Okay funniest thing, if you don't look left or right to turn at corners your character will run straight into the wall 'THWACK!' and your dead lol. Yes you lose a life and have to go back to the last checkpoint. But the fact that you can kill yourself by stupidly running into walls is pretty amusing.Yes the game has repetitive elements e.g. the same looking obstacles multiple times. However I think the pacing makes up for this. The player character is constantly running and only stops at the end of a stage or to take down enemies in quick time animations. The game definitely can become frustrating. You make the right action to avoid obstacles i.e. some can only be slid under while others you must leap over. If you accidentally jump for example when you should have slid you can't undo that action and you hit the obstacle. A lot of the obstacles are insta-death. I chewed through my lives dying repeatedly at the same spot and had to restart stages from the beginning several times. But I wouldn't go as far as to say that the game is unfair. You just need to think fast. And if you want you can change the difficulty to easy if you wish (I didn't try that though). It would be nice if the game paused when it gives you tutorial tips because by time I processed them it was too late and I died in the obstacle. Lastly it was exciting when I first transformed into a werewolf.The graphics aren't 'AAA' standard but the game looks good. I liked the music. The dialogue from the holo-chick or whatever she is got a little bit annoying at times especially when you hear the same thing again and again because you have to repeat a stage several times. But surprisingly I later found that some of the dialogue was actually funny (intentionally).Clickherefor more let’s play videos =)"
