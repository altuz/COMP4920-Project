,Recommended,279940,16768998,"Posted: 28 June, 2015",all,KillerM,"TLDR: One of the best point & click adventures, worth getting at full priceThe Good+ Great graphics, the best I've seen in a point & click adventure+ Great voice acting (I played it in English)+ Great writing, very funny and self aware.+ Very long play time. The trailer claims 25 hours, but it's more like 15. I did click through most conversations since I finished reading before they were done talking.+ Needed a hint only 3 times, and only one of those times was actually justified. This was mainly due to the ability to display all important locations on the screen, so I didn't need to go pixel hunting.The Bad- Sometimes the game freezes and you may lose some progress, but not too much since autosaves are frequent.- There are some audio bugs that don't really affect gameplay since everything said is also written, but still annoying.- Most NPCs were characters that came back from the first game. There are some interesting new characters like the gnome bounty hunter, but they don't get enough story.- Too many story threads are left open at the end, with many things that are hinted at but not shown in this game.- No replayability value. I won't play the entire game again just to get the few achievements that I missed"

You will probably be more than a little confused with the story. Critter Chronicles can be skipped if you want, though I still plan to play it, if for no other reason than I need a third game in this wonderful franchise ASAP.While the narrative is very connected between games 1 and 2, this one takes things up several notches. You can see it immediately in the production value, particularly in terms of the beautiful visuals. In just about every way, the look and feel of the game has stepped up in effort and budget by a substantial and noticable amount. The first game feels instantly dated once you play this sequel.Gameplay-wise, the games are pretty identical. The puzzles are some of the best the genre has to offer, often based on the interaction of multiple playable characters which you swap between freely. There is very little, if any moon logic. But there's just enough challenge to make it cerebral enough for puzzle addicts like me.Then there's the story. While the first game was a fourth-wall breaking comedy, the sequel is a 'dramedy'; serious and soulful AND filled with laughs. Coming from being a fan of darker stories like Gabriel Knight, I appreciate a story that makes me care this much without resorting to melodrama.This is a classic in the adventure game genre, and I cannot recommend it enough. If you ever want proof that these games haven't completely died, here it is."

76561198011233147,Recommended,279940,29273164,Posted: 15 January,all,J3ST3R,"Nice, but not as good as its predecessor(s)!The First BoUT took me by surprise and I ended up simply loving it. It had clever humor, nice references and fantastic characters. The ""extension"" named Critter's Chronicles didn't quite live up to the first game, but was still quite fun and still had that quirky humor that I loved in the first one. When it comes to this installment I'm slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong. I still think it is quite good and well worth playing if you are into adventure games, but to me it falls a bit flat and thin compared to the others.Firstly, it has to be said that this game is probably one of the lengthiest point & click adventure games I've ever played, and that should be a good thing. Only, I feel like the story and plot has been stretched just for that reason, to be lengthy. This makes portions of the game feel a bit dull and unnecessary, and I hate to say it, but it could have gained a lot by shortening it a bit to keep momentum up. This caused me to get a bit bored with it all and I had to take some breaks from the game to do something else and then come back to it. Something that is unusual for me to do.You get to play the same characters as you do in the previous titles and they are all very familiar, though I found it to lack a bit of the fun banter they had in the first game. For the most part the voice actors on both the main characters and the NPC's you meet on the way are done well, but is at times a bit monotone. Wilbur especially seem to react pretty much the same way to every situation. At times it feels a bit more read out loud voicing instead of acting while voicing. I'm however more surprised about the voicing of some of the NPC's as some of them are really good. I also like that you get to meet a lot of the characters you met through your first adventure in this universe, and more than a handful of new ones as well. Sadly my favorite from the first game was nowhere to be found here (Death).When the game finally came to an end it felt very anticlimactic to me. A bit rushed even, which seems odd seeing that everything else seemed stretched out. It definitely leaves you on a cliffhanger with hints to a 3rd book coming eventually. And, even though I felt this was a step down from the first, I hope there will be another one. There is a lot of talent in this team and I want to see where they take it next.Artistically the game is brilliant. It looks absolutely stunning. The scenery and backdrops are highly detailed and has a lot of fun elements to them. The characters and their animations are well designed and suitably quirky in the way they behave. You're bound to fall in love with several of them.The music is also very well made, and clearly inspired by the works of John Williams. Already in the main menu did I feel like I was going to go on an Indiana Jones adventure. I would however have liked a bit more sound effects in the game itself. Some ambient sounds and the like to build up the atmosphere of your surroundings, and also maybe some more dramatic build-ups to certain events. However, I do understand that one does have to cut some corners to make budget.There are some technical issues too. I did not experience any crashing or game-breaking bugs, but I had quite a few losses of audio. More a slight irritation than anyhing as you also get text to read, so you don't necessarily lose much. It also seemed a bit unresponsive at times  and I had several occations where I had to click several times on an item for my character to interact with it and even to walk to certain places. I also found the inventory a bit clunky to deal with, but that could possibly just be preferences.All in all it is mostly a good game but it failed to really engage me. After completing it I felt a bit unfulfilled, and I was left with several unanswered questions. Let's hope that they continue the story and ties up all the loose ends there and go out with a big bang. For an adventure fan there is still a lot of worth in this title and I would certainly not want to miss it, but it does not feel like a game that would make many new fans of the genre either. By this time the game should be pretty easy to get on a sale, so if you are looking for a lengthy and cheap adventure you might want to look into it. It would certainly be worth getting on a discounted price.I'm ending up giving this a 6/10 rating which might be a bit strict. At least compared to the overall ratings here at Steam. But to me it is slightly above average. It is of course a subjective opinion and if you read this as a tool to decide to get the game or not, be sure to check out several reviews and not base it on this alone. Even though I didn't find it to be all that good, your opinion could differ a lot from mine. And clearly a lot of others found this to be very very good. Thanks for taking the time to read my review :o)Happy gaming!TJ"

I love the side quests (who knew they even did that in Click & Point games?) & the script is clever, funny & well voiced. The story moves along well, the puzzles are tricky enough that they're a lot of fun but not so tricky that they take away from the story.All in all an amazing game so far & the best point & click game....possibly ever, really shows what could be acheived in point & click games if companies were willing to put the resources in :)"

I recently completed The Book of Unwritten Tales (and its extension, the Critter Chronicles). A great game with very likable characters, a very nice art style and a superb voice acting performance.This title here certainly lives up to its predecessor. I played through chapter one so far and laughed out loud several times while doing so... that does not happen often for me in video games :-).Took me around five hours. As the full version will have five chapters, this title seems to have even more content than the first game had. And, judging from the chapter release dates so far, I am confident that this title will indeed be out of early access pretty soon.At one point, I had some technical issues resulting in the game stuck with no further interaction possible. Luckily, I could fix the problem by changing the graphic quality from high to low and then back to high again. I am confident these problems will be resolved in the full version.If you like adventures, you should definitely buy this game."

76561198090819690,Recommended,279940,19865305,"Posted: 22 December, 2015",all,epsilonfive,"A charming, hilarious and fun adventure with the perfect balance of puzzle difficulty. This point and click has my favourite puzzle design because they are not too hard to figure out, but also not too easy. The characters are unique, interesting and lively, and the graphics are gorgeous without putting too much strain on a computer (as a laptop gamer, I especially appreciate this as there is nothing sadder to me than a game I really want to play with specs that my computer can just about manage with lags). As in the first game, Wilbur is an absolute treasure, Ivo is as great a female character as ever and Critter is quirky, sweet and loyal. Nate has grown more likable in this game as well as gained a fair amount of depth and development.Personally I enjoyed the return of NPCs from the previous title as I like callbacks and appearences from earlier games in a series, and they are just as fun to talk to and interact with as they were in the first game. The voice acting is absolutely brilliant with a range of accents and voices which are organic and smooth.I also have fun with the function of switching between characters and swapping items between them, as well as the little conversations they share. I love the addition of sidequests in which you can gain costumes which look great on the characters, and so feel like a nice reward. The ost is also extremely good with a few pieces sticking with me after I take a break from the game.The expansion on and creation of areas such as the Elfburrow is also interesting to see, giving a nice variation on areas and allowing more characters or interactions to be introduced and viewed. The length of the game is a healthy one and helps make it worth every penny, especially when it's on sale.I had to look up for help a few times, but I still think that the difficulty is perfectly balanced, allowing me to feel accomplished as I beat most of the game myself. The game has also bugged out a couple of times, but not to an extent where it's too frustrating. The autosave feature makes it possible to not have to go back as far as you would think. The game engine used for this sequel seems to be a little more buggy than the previous games, but as I said it's nothing too bad. I have researched others' experiences with the game and a lot of the issues seem to be fixed. Sometimes the voices do not play, or have a strange quiet echo to them, but most of the time you can just have the character repeat the line and hear it properly.I've heard complaints about the ending, but honestly I see no problems with it. It does what it's supposed to - set up for the next game in the series. In the sequel I'd really like to see more of Lizzy.All in all this game has imprinted on me and is a real joy to experience, making me want to play as much as I can at once and return to it often."

The first game was splendid but the Critter Chronicles a bit less enjoyable, so I was afraid of being disappointed. But I wasn't. At all. This game is pure gold !Wilbur, Nate, Critter and Ivo (and others) - those memorable characters you learned to love in the previous games - are back once again to save Aventásia. This adventure offers around 20 hours of entertaining gameplay : probably the lengthiest point & click that I know of. Gladly the kind humour remains the same, with so many references of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, etc. This game made me smile and laugh so many times I stopped counting. The gameplay is intuitive, but there are complex and challenging puzzles or actions nevertheless.From an artistic point of view, the game is simply astonishing : the graphics are gorgeous and colorful, sometimes you just take a minute to admire the background and the details ; the soundtrack regroups elements of the first game and adds some new splendid musics (surprised myself humming after playing) ; the voice acting remains impeccable, at least in English.I would advise to playThe Book of Unwritten Talesfirst in order to get familiar with the story and the characters. In my humble opinion this game deserves more credit : it's a must-have for comedy / point and click lovers. Let me cross my fingers for a Book of Unwritten Tales 3."

The voice acting is excellent.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and its puzzles are logical (no sierra logic, which the critter chronicles had a lot of (getting the penguin drunk?).I never got too stuck in the game.

But not so great for those that want a more serious game. The comedy is really great in this one, and personally I feel it is better than the first one. Since the reference humor and fourth-wall-breaking comedy doesn’t get quite as hard-handed as it did at times in the original.There are a lot of characters from the first game, so if you like them you are most likely going to like them here as well, as their personalities haven’t changed too much.The only character that seems to have changed a bit is Ivo. I found her role in this game to be particularly funny this time around, especially since I had gotten to know her as an athletic adventure seeking young elf in the first game. And to be honest the only one that truly seemed to belong on a dangerous quest of the four playable characters. To see her being in a gilded cage and wearing a pretty dress was for some reason strangely amusing to me.There are also plenty of other side characters returning, as well as some new and fun characters thrown into the mix.As for the puzzles. For the most part they are still great and challenging, however not all of them are equally easy to figure out. There were a few where I had no idea what I was supposed to do, because they just had such an odd solution, that I hardly believed it even after it was done. Like before it is often a good idea to go back and talk to characters you have previously talked to, in order for them to give you the item you need to progress. But it is consistent throughout the game, which is better than being a surprise just once.The game keeps up the cartoony and charming style, which fits the very comedic and light hearted atmosphere of the game.A great adventure game and I hope they make a new one. (Even if I hope Critter and Nate won’t be in it. As I dislike those two a lot. But you might like them, and they don’t really affect my view on the game, since they weren’t that terrible. Just preferred if it had been only Ivo and Wilbur.)"

And it doesn't stop at that, being funny and inventive for the whole 20+ hours.Alas, for such a long game the ending feels rushed and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Obviously, King Art has plans for TBOUT 3, but that's still not an excuse for a cliffhanger plus a lot of plot holes.Anyway, this is still one of the best contemporary adventure games along with Deponia trilogy and Sherlock Holmes series.

I didn't play any of the previous games in the series but I had no problem following the game, since I was able to draw out plenty of information from the dialogues between the characters.  For the price, the length of the game is perfect (about 20-30 hours, depending on how patient you are to go through each and every dialogue) and thanks to the feature that lets you know what you can and cannot interact with (space bar, and it's going to show what's available around you), you don't need outside help that much.  All of the puzzles/missions/quests in the game are very intuitive and fun, arguably a little too formulaic and not that creative, but still enjoyable.Now I'm very much intrigued to try the other games in the series.  The game is worth every penny at its full price and at its sale price it's definitely a steal.  Hope everyone picks it up during this holiday season and dive into the adventure of Nate, Willard, Ivo and Critter.   Very highly recommended."

That is something I appreciate for a game where you want to live an adventure (I hate when games are too short for a story to develop).I think the game itself is fantastic and there are some beautiful creative puzzles in it but I don't want to spoil it for you. I'll just say that if you like point-and-click adventure games you must play this one. It's not expensive, it goes on sale a few times a year and it's fun to play, what else can you ask for?By the way, you can play this game without having played its prequels but I strongly recommend clearingThe Book of Unwritten Talesfirst if you want to get to know characters better."

I don't normally write reviews for games but that is not because i don't feel the games aren't good enough, its just that i didn't feel the urge to express my complete love and awe for them as i do for this MASTERPIECE  of a game!! You guys have created a pure gem of a game (and series) and i simply can't get enough of it. I just love everything about this game. Its perfect in every single way. You guys have taken the point and click genre to a whole new level. You have taken the traditional gameplay formula and unravelled it and have polished it up with the most up to date references of other games, movies, books,etc and such a perfect sense of humour from juicy biting satire to the most ridiculous hilarious jokes and anecdotes etc.. I constantly have to go back and save moments in game to shoe my family as the comedy is priceless and so hard to replicate and produce in this era. Seriously guys you know what you are doing and I just pray and hope that the Book of Unwritten Tales series continues. Please don't stop what you are doing, you guys are perfect and keep this genre alive and kicking!!!! I LOVED THIS GAME and recommend any adventure lover with a sense of humour to try it out!!!!

What a great cliffhanger at the end of Part 2. Stories just keep getting better and better over the years. The characters and stories are so enjoyable, you forget you've been playing over 8 hours. Can't wait for the continuing adventures of my favorite gnome - Wilber Weathervane. Here’s a review of Part 1 I wrote on Amazon back in 2012. If you want to feel like you're on a quest as Frodo Baggins was in Lord of the Rings, or be reminded of Yoda from Star Wars when a little gremlin appears in the palm of your hand, or just enjoy being in a magical world like Harry Potter, you will look forward to sitting down and opening The Book of Unwritten Tales. You will be going on an adventure with four characters but I like Wilbur Weathervane. I'm routing for you little guy, by the way he's a gnome. The controls are very easy to learn - just point and click. Press the spacebar if you get befuddled but use it sparingly. The creative author weaved a unique tale of good vs. evil. With a swish and flick of their paint brush, the imaginative graphic artists will whisk you off to an enchanted world. The voice actors with their wee bit of a Scottish accent have the best voices to tell a story, and hearing the sounds of birds singing, bees buzzing, potions exploding, wind blowing while you're atop a dragon, helps to immerse you into the story. I wish I could smell the flowers. Someday we might have a button on our game consoles for smell. Now what would it be called? I know! How about the Sensatizer or Sensometer or the NoseKnows? I leave that to your imagination. Soooooo, if you're looking for a virtual book to read and one that you will wish the story never ends, look no further than The Book of Unwritten Tales."

Later on Death becomes excited by Wilbur's notion that people could pay Death to bury them in the ground. Of course this actually just a trick for Wilbur to get Death's hat to preform a magic trick.

The graphics are stunning, the voice acting is great and the soundtrack is nice to listen to. Thankfully, the puzzles are slightly more challenging than in the first game, but still never frustrating. The story features all of the well known characters from the first two games and is again filled with puns and references to other games/books and films we all love.The only downsides I can think of are:- The new inventory is a step backwards. The old one where you just had to move the cursor to the bottom of the screen was way easier to use.- A few bugs with the speech audio files (especially in the German version, some parts are not voiced or the volume is completely off)- The movement of the characters sometimes feels too slow and it can be annoying when they are stuck in animations that force you to wait.What I miss:- Having chapters or acts with rendered movies in between them would be great because it feels so rewarding when you hit those points in the game.For fans of the classic point&click adventure genre this is an absolute must have, but I would recommend this to anyone really, since it is such a fantastic game and probably the only game of the genre that has the look and feel of a AAA production. Finally, the game is also good value because even as a veteran adventure player, resorting to a walkthrough guide a couple of times and not always waiting for audio to play out, the first playthrough took a full 24 hours.PS: Do not play it with a controller, you will regret it."

The characters are compelling, the story line well crafted, graphics are polished and the puzzels were fun and not too abstact.  There is lots of humor and jokes that fans of adventure games/sci-fi/fantasy and even horror will enjoy.  I am closing in on the final chapter but have already logged a solid 30hrs of game play and loved every minute of it.  If you are a fan of Adventure games then purchase this game with confidence and enjoy.  If you do not like story-driven games you will likely find the pace slow and uninteresting and may want to consider spending your money on something different.  I would rate this a great 8.5/10 Adventure."

I fell in LOVE when I played the first game last year, bought the Critter Chronicles (which was TOO SHORT but wonderful), and as soon as I saw this game was up for Early Access-I nabbed it!There are quite a few bugs right now, I've been stuck a few times BUT the game developers have been on point with updates and wanting to know the tech issues and everything so I really trust they're going to make an effortlessy beautiful game by February 20.Even with any bug/tech issue that's come up-NOTHING has deterred me from saying I LOVE THIS GAME! It's FUN and FUNNY. I love it! And completely reccomend it."

(Didn't play the first one)My initial reaction was pure bliss. I was having a great time, and I could tell the game was making a few references to the first one (I think). In the first major puzzle scene (with the elf female) there were a TON of awesome references to Games and I was having a blast and enjoying myself. The puzzles were actually very well done so you had a good scene of what you were supposed to be doing and how to get there. Then, after completing this one...The fun stopped.I suppose it's because the game needed to shove some storyline down my face? I'm not sure really; but the two major scenes after this one were extremely boring/frustrating because they lacked some kind of major 'driving idea' of what should be going on. If the ""fun factor"" was an 8 in my previous paragraph... it was now a 2. They'd drop a good line here and there but overall I just got more, and more bored; and I was really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I was gettin bored because the game came started with some bang!The scenes start to drag on; along with the dialogue. The puzzles aren't really puzzles... but more-so just annoyances. Again, this is just an honest-to-god accounting of my experience in the game so far. People attached to the game might shoot me down for saying that; but as someone that's never played the first (and I don't see myself playing it) I was still having a good time.... at the beginning.I've encountered a few bugs; one of the last ones had frozen the game up, but not from a system point of view. But, rather that all the characters stopped moving because a parrot couldn't path to something and it seemed like all the actors were waiting for it to path correctly. (Had to close the game) But, that's not the reason why I'm not recommeding the game; nothing can ship perfect.There's currently where I'm at.... and right now I can only recommend the game if you play the first ""Area/Chapter"" (Not sure what else to call it) and then stop. The 2nd Chapter has some cute 'throwbacks' to gaming (Which I love!) but the puzzles are frustrating because the developers (in this chapter) didn't do well in directing the player to their objectives (which is required in a point-n-click adventure) as they did in the other Chapter previous.(I'm talking about the Troll Janitor that has the Keys & the 'Last Page' of the book)I'll update this review as I continue to play; but right now I'm getting more and more bored, and I was really enjoying the game in the first hours...  :sad panda:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Review Update: Turning this around from a Frown to a Smile and giving it a Recommendation.All things consider previously; I do think that's a part of the game that needed some revisiting. The mood change from that Chapter to the next is pretty swingy. I wasn't the only one that had issues and felt this way. So, I warn you! It'll get a little rough early-mid on but it does get better again!I painstakeningly made it through that little rough patch and as soon as I did... boy was I laughing and having a good time again. Puzzles were being more presentable and logical again, lots of hilarious references, and just back to its fun and amusing self.It's got me back in the mindset of, ""I can't wait to get home from work to see what happens next!""."

Assuming you play legitimately without a walkthrough, the game should last you a long time figuring things out by comparasin to other click adventures, and you'll easily obtain any achievements you missed along the way by loading your previous saves (completionists tip: don't skip the credits at the end, the achievement for watching the credits doesn't count when watching from the menu). The puzzles present a good bit of challenge and you'll end up wracking your brain at times. luckily the hardest ones are optional, but those ones are worth it to pick up the extra outfits. However, it is very pricy for what it is and the extra price for the almanac edition doesn't really warrant getting that upgrade either. Overall I'd say it'd be good to get when it goes on sale, or if you're just swimming in money and don't care."

Critter Chronicles was alright too; fun but not amazing.tBoUT2, however, is fantastic. I'd put it up there with the Monkey Islands and Grim Fandango in terms of the memory it's left me with. Everything is so much tighter - the animations, writing, characters, puzzles. I really felt a sense of scale and coherence in the game universe. Fantastic job from King Art games.Only downside is that it ends on a cliffhanger, but I'm looking forward to 3 now.Shout out to Benny Oschmann and his gorgeous score as well.
