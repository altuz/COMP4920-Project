,Recommended,279990,11523624,"Posted: 2 August, 2014",all,ixi,The concept is simple: build a stable bridge that will successfully withhold large quantities of weight. Connecting platforms to balance the weight and avoiding stress is the key solution to completing a level.

The best of the series is Medieval.In this one, it gets too repetitive with having the same scenario, but you must build different bridges to meet the multiple badge requirements per level.   Build a truck-worthy bridge really cheaply, then again more expensive but where no piece is really strained, then again using only X-types of pieces.... eh.It just feels too similar to the regular ""Bridge Constructor"", so I'd recommend getting one, not both.  Better yet, getBridge Constructor: Medieval...it has a corny ""story"", better challenges, varying goals/restrictions for each level, and feels more varied.  Then if you want more, then get one of the others in the series...The different construction challenges are nice, but not for every level.  Overall: 7"

I was duped into thinking this was like a bridge building game that I played around 10 years ago... That game (being 10 years old) is better than this game.The acheivements in the game do not work correctly.  You earn badges depending on material and money spent building a bridge. Even though I met the requirement on several of the badges, I DID NOT GET THE BADGE.  Along with this, the game is very short.  Also, you cannot see 1st person view of the car as it is driving over the bridge.  You can only build flat bridges so no fun ramps or anything when you get bored with how terrible this game is.Again, do NOT waste your money or your time."

The music is less annoying, but still pretty annoying, but that's kind of part of the experience at this point.This is, in my opinion, and overall improvement over the previous game. Any semblance of a pretense to being an actual game is gone. You just make bridges and many of them go PPPPPBTTH KRCHINGK and fall apart, then the truck clips through everything, and hangs upside-down by the wheels and wheedles back and forth for the 5min you roll around on the floor laughing.It looks better. It sounds better. It's not much better at all :)Best.Worst.Game.EVER.Any bad reviews here aren't in on the joke, and I do feel bad for them. They bought this thinking they were going to get a real bridge building simulation.NOPE.Just king of derp games. I crown it now. It has been dubbed.... actually there probably is a dub remix of the  first theme song... That thought made me kinda sad... I know how to fix that! BUILD A FRAGILE BRIDGE so PPPPPPBBBBBBBTHTHTHTHTHTH"

This game is beginning to turn into a Zylom / King like game; exploit it until everybody is sick of the game and don't wants to be reminded of it ever existing... Don't let it come that far, devs..."
