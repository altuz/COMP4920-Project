The settings are nice and detailed but there is a lot of stock RPG-Maker characters in the background. The drawings of the main characters are nice but aren't consistent with their 2D-sprite (the main character wears a kimono in combat and a sleeveless dress out of combat).There is a lot to customize (difficulty, randomness of the encounters, guiding arrows) and this is cool.Now, what prevented me to finish this game ? First and foremost, the scenario. It's just incredibly stupid, with caricatural characters and cheesy lines. What's the main motivation of the heroine ? She saw squirrels helping each others... I swear I'm not making this up.And I hope you're not allergic to giggles because you'll see a lot of them.Here's an example :- This forest looks so scary. We should head back home.- Come on. You're a guy, you shouldn't be afraid. *giggle*Yes it's that bad.I could have overlooked this (with gritted teeth), but the dungeons are also far too long. And the numerous quests ? Fetch quests that have nothing to do with anything (find a cute dress for a random girl, find 10 grapes for a random guy...).In the end, I see what people could like in this game. But it clearly isn't my style."
,Recommended,280140,13901189,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,Submarine_SantaFe,"Overall, I really enjoyed Millennium - A New Hope.  It's a solid RPG with a good blend of challenge, interesting characters, story, secrets, large dungeons and a bit of humor.   If you hate RPG Maker games, you won't like it no matter what I write here, so keep that in mind.  For the rest of you, I'd say there's a lot to like in Millennium.The game itself is a 5 part series, so keep that in mind when buying it.  If you're thinking about the Millennium series, you should start with this one (obviously).  You're then allowed to export your characters (with their inventories) to the next game after beating it.  There's at least 20 hours of gameplay here, I think I finished it in hard mode at about 25 hours.  I normally never play games on hard mode, but I did with Millennium and I enjoyed the challenge and extra achievements.  There are a number of interesting and challenging achievements for this game.  There are 24 secret rooms scattered throughout the world, 40 quests (both main and sidequests), and a lot of hidden things.Combat is fun and challenging.  The boss fights are pretty epic and there are optional tough ""animal kings"" for you to fight as an extra challenge after beating the main boss.   Level design is well executed.  The secret rooms are challenging to find and some of the dungons are HUGE with lots to explore.  Luckily, there is an option to have arrows occasionally point you in the right direction if you wish.  Unlike some other Aldorlea RPGs, you get the option to have enemies visible on the map instead of random encounter pop-ups after so many steps.   The plot is solid, if not ground breaking and keeps you on track.  I would say the plot speeds up and becomes more complex in M2.  The music was enjoyable as well.I only have a few complaints that are pretty minor.  Early in the game, gold is pretty rare!  You'll need to be a bit careful with your purchases.  The economy is tight so don't expect to buy 99 of every healing item, etc.   My only other complaint is that there is an achievement for beating 30 quests with the last character you recruit for your party.  In order to get this achievement, you need to actively avoid completing any quests for most of the game and then come back to them after beating the main boss.  This is a bit anticlimactic.  If you don't worry about this achievement, it's not a problem, however.  Other than that, it's an excellent RPG that's well worth your time.   If you're on the fence about this game, there's a free demo from Aldorlea's website that lets you play the full game for an hour to see if you like it.I hope this review gets you excited to try the Millennium saga!"

If you like that old style of gameplay and graphics you'll feel right at home. If you're expecting a modern game, you might look somewhere else. As for how it compares to the SNES RPG classics? I'd say it's surely no Final Fantasy VI or Chrono Trigger. Though it holds itself pretty good compared to the likes of Breath of Fire (1), Lufia (1) and Dragon Quest V. If you like those games, surely give Millennium a chance!Strong points of this RPG:- Great environment design. Large dungeons and interesting overworld, towns etc- So many secrets to be found!

This is valid, I think, because the problems are exactly same.I gave these games a genuine try, but everything by Aldorlea has the same set of problems. Horrible level design, the most god awfully boring and unsatisfying stories, TONS of HUD problems, and a single goddamn music track for each game.

,Not Recommended,280140,21009555,"Posted: 6 February, 2016",all,blubberjones,"This game has a weird mix of acceptable art and really amateurish graphics of varying, often not very matching styles.It also has an odd mix of a versatile interface with many features like mouse navigation (unusual for older RPG Maker games), but then the mouse navigation feels odd with the cursor moving slow and sluggish and things generally not being as snappy as you would expect and the interface also feels slightly messy.It also starts off with an acceptably engaging intro, but then throws you into a large map with absolutely no indication about what you should be doing, not even an obvious pressing quest that catches your immediate attention - which makes it lose the initial momentum built up from the intro.Generally it just seems like it might have been born out of a good, grand vision, but then suffered from many many uneven bumps in its execution turning it into a quite mediocre game. If the developer went back to the drawing board and figured out all the small but many details wrong with it, I think it could be easily turned into an enjoyable niche game - but as it is, I wouldn't recommend it."

But, honestly, it was a  great storyline, dont know why it is split into 5 parts. It would have been lovely to just buy the whole package and be done instead of part 1 - 5.

So for this, I will only focus on Millennium - A New Hope.This feels like a very good ""Game Boy"" game. The gameplay, effects and all; my gaming rig is under-utilized. For its price, of course we shouldn’t expect high end effects. Though some of the background are beautifully drawn up; A Game Boy would never be able to display that. A lot of aspects can be done better. The only reason why you will be buying this or the entire saga package with deluxe contents, will be the storyline. And trust me, you do NOT want to bash through the game blindly without any walkthrough and the community's knowledge support. I know it may sound a bit pointless. But to waste time to explore much of the maps yourself rather than to consult the existing lore, that's even more pointless.Play hard mode and quest properly. Because your effort here will make your game better in the next few titles. Some of the Steam Achievements for this part is ridiculous. Who knows, maybe you're a better player who can get it done right without replaying from scratch so many times.Do get the Deluxe Edition because the walkthrough gets you through everything. Whether or not you can win the battles, that depends on how you grind your characters. Visit ""The Official Aldorlea Games Forum"" for community's support. Do not grind too much though. Because the one thing I hate so much about this series even though they support importing your saves into the next title, is that your character's level gets reset back to according to the title! The only relief is that most of your items get carried over. Some items can't though. I wished at least the character's HP/SP gets carried forward instead of being wasted away. The bloody gold carried over gets limited too! Jesus... So, convert your extra gold into items which you can sell off for gold in next title.This title is the hardest and most time consuming. But your effort will be well worth in as you import towards the rest of the titles. You have to start your Millennium quest from this title. Well, because; The Forge. I shall include a list of “Things that can be done better” on my review on the next title."

I was a particular fan of the Phantasy Star franchise. To me this game has all the right elements. It is quaint & quirky, the dialogue tends to ramble on (I think that is a cultural thing with Japanese inspired/created games). There is the classic story of the fight against injustice, the pastoral start & the gradual discovery of advanced technology. 'Farming' of experience, items & cash is all possible due to zonal re-spawns, there is a minor 'platformer' element aesthetically but this will not frustrate the unskilled as there are no  death drops. The music is great, the maps are huge, the difficulty is well balanced and customisable and there are non-linear side quests. Its difficult to see how anyone can legitimately criticise this game. It is a really good long play, particularly if you are 'casual' like I am though I am sure you can try to race through it if that is your thing. The price is unbelievably low, do not just buy it, buy 2 and give one a freind. A rare treat & excellent value even at 10 times the asking price. Five stars!"

The inciting incident is the serious injury of Marine's father. Marine isn't exactly ready to take up his cause, but finds herself swept up into doing so by adventures not completely of her choosing. Sometimes being a helpful young lady can lead to all sorts of powerful things. (No, not the bad type.)I believe at the start she is still around 14 at the oldest, but the scope of these games might be long enough that she may well fall in love with someone she meets along the way.Gameplay is fun, and the cards look nice. It is also one of the better-made RPGMaker-type games I've seen. Beautiful, and has a rich back-setting.Even better, it is the tale of someone stricken with poverty rising up to take on the rich and decadent (and if not evil, completely uncaring).

There are so many great features to this game so i'll break it down a little bit.Graphics -Great use of space on the maps, Aldorlea didn't just plonk everything down randomly , some real thought has gone into the placement and planing of maps, the towns give a great feeling of size and depth. A big mistake lots of RPG's make is to make a village in the middle of no where and set every house 3 feet from their neightbour, while convienient for the player it's not realistic. Millennium rarely makes this mistake.The character art is amazing, I love the style and that they have steered clear of the standard anime-esk facesets that lots RPG games of late have been using.Sound -The music is great too! I don't usually enjoy the soundtrack when I'm playing an Indie RPG is all seems the same, Millenium has really done well with it's music. I'm not sure if it was custom made for the game or not, but i've played so many RPG's and I havnt heard it before.GameplayI think having mouse support is something that more RPGs should be using, When you're relaxing with a new game and it's getting late no one likes to be huddled over their keyboard getting hand cramps :PThe comat is well balanced, and being able to call a fairy for heal and deal damage for you during combat is a great idea I havn't seen before.The interation between player and NPC's is really well written, I didn't get an urge to just pound the keyboard / mouse to skip the NPC dialog, It was really enjoyable to read.StoryWithout giving away the story for anyone who is about to start playing, All I will say is Awesome! you will not be disapointed.Now I can't throw all this Positive at you without giving you a critisismThe mouse pathfinding isn't great!thats it, that's the negitive. :D"

Music is so loud it causes pain in my ears from my headset, even if I turn down the headset volume."

I just didn't get what was happening.- Battle system is boring as hell. I mean, sure it's the default - but it feels like next to no thought was put into battling/skill use etc.There are lots of RPGMaker-based games that deliver an amazing experience - this just isn't one of them."

The game itself is okay, but I absolutely hate games with time-limits built in. I don't like being forced to rush and not get everything done that can be. That's just not a good thing. I'll probably go back and play it some more and see if it gets beyond that point, but as of now I can't recommend this to anyone."

,Not Recommended,280140,10711724,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,trolltasm,"I wouldn't recommend this game. In fact, even though I got it on sale, I still think it was a huge waste of money, and I paid little more than $2 for it.The writing and plot didn't draw me in at all--it felt school-aged, cliche, and trite. Marina was annoying, and Benoit was absurd. I don't know about any of the other characters, because I honestly didn't bother to play that long. The dialogue alone was enough to make my eyes want to bleed.This game has all the makings of a classically annoying RPG: a soundtrack that drives you nuts (seriously, why are women vocalizing together in the beginning town stages???), enemies and bosses that have some obnoxiously overpowered attacks even on normal and easy modes (oh, you can paralyze, bleed, and blind me? That's cute; thanks for that), and a story that failed to capture my interest even in the smallest measure.As for the grinding and battling, it left a lot to be desired. Enemies can wail on you 'til kingdom come, and you don't get a lot of gold to get healing items or characters with high enough SP to afford to continously heal more than 3 or 4 times. Even with the items you find or occasional rest area, it's not enough unless you want to spend all your items on healing instead of armor and weapons. Fun fact: most of the monsters I fought don't drop you a single piece of gold.All I can say is I most definitely am NOT buying anything else from this developer, no matter what the sale price is."

So if you have around $50+ to spend and like classic rpg, then get it, but if you wanted a cheap game then dont."
