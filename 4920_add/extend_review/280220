It's thegameplaywhich is the real selling point of this game.For those of you on the fence, imagine attempting to fight a tidal wave. With guns. And mortars. And another tidal wave of your own. And sometimes really big guns. The Creeper is a living liquid that makes Tiberium look like a small chemical spill. It's coming for you from all sides and directions. It cares not for the small base you've built, only for consuming everything.So dig in. In some levels you'll have to do this quite literally, as terraforming is a tool at your disposal. In some levels you'll be hanging on by a thread, almost consumed the second your power goes down to build that reactor you need to expand. In other levels, you will actively hate the liquid that is all set to consume everything you've worked so hard to create.But you will love every second of this game.A really unique concept which will keep you entertained for hours on end.

I will add a TL;DR at the end.GameplayCreeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a perfect mix of RTS and Tower Defense along with aspects of slight management. You fight against a liquid like and versatile foe known as Creeper. This game has infinite, and I do mean nearly infinite replayability. Once you finish the base story you can go and do thousands of more missions created by the creators and the community. This is the best strategy game I have ever played. There is not much in this world like being completely surrounded by Creeper and slowly, ever so slowly pushing back and destroying every last piece of it. There are tons of ways to beat levels whether you want to attack swiftly with risk or play for a longer game to build your layout to counteract the ever attacking foe. You can even create anti-creeper or terraform the land around you to add even more to this games amazing functions. Overall this game has a very unique and formidable foe and is the best and one of the most exhilarating strategy games I have ever played.Graphics/SoundsI love the look of the creeper, weaponry, even the terrain. The music fits with the game giving an adventurous and formidable feel of the unknown.Pros/ConsPros+ Unique game playstyle+ Enormous amount of replayability+ Addicting+ Ranges from super easy to maps where you will wonder who was sadistic enough to make it+ Huge amount of maps to play+ Good story+ Map editorCons- May becomes repetitive to someFinal ThoughtsI remember playing the first Creeper World on kongregate and thinking ""I love this game, holy crap it's amazing"". Next came Creeper World 3: Abraxis and I played it the moment it was available and again loved it but wished there was more than the 12 missions and then around a year later I got Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal on steam.  I love the game, just love it. This is definitely one of my favourite games to ever play. I also found out a while ago a new game which I think is called Particle Fleet is being developed by Knuckle Cracker and I really hope it makes its eventual way onto steam since it looks amazing. This game to me is a piece of true satisfaction and fun. This is a mix of two of my favourite types of games which are RTS and Tower Defense and it has combined those two perfectly in my opinion.TL;DRCreeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a great mix of RTS and Tower Defense games. It has a unique and constantly attacking foe known as the Creeper and is an astounding strategy game. If you are unsure whether to get this game or not check out Creeper World 3: Abraxis on kongregate to get an idea of the basics of the game and general gameplay."

This game is great :P I wanted my review to be my original thought about the game from looking at the screenshots, which was:""What are tho.. Ah, so.. The lines mo.. uh.. Wait, then those bubb, er.. And they.. ? What is tha.."" :PIn short, this game is about the primal fear of water ruining your cool stuff. Imagine your kitchen. Its awesome. Except now you've decided to catalog your prize comic book collection, THE WHOLE THING. Its going to take a while. The table ispiled so full that you've had to start making piles on the floor here and there. Suddenly, your child drops a full glass jug of apparently antique milk and it shatters!! *suspenseful music* Now, the antique milk hasn't splashed on your comicbooks.. YET!But its spreading!! And, lucky you, besides collecting comic books you also design small functional mortars and cannons that fire small liquid-absorbing sponges, all supplied by intricate wiring relays that transport power from a central battery. For the sake of cohesion we'll say you developed the sponge cannons because of your mortifing phobia of dish cloths, also, so you can't just mop the liquid up.. *cough* If you're quick enough, you can set up an intricate web of relays linked to your tiny armada of sponge-launching war-machines aaaall along the kitchen floor in a milk-encircling radius and potentially combat the comic-ruining liquid menace before your precious copy of Jurrasic Park #1 is ruined.That's what the game is about. Yep.In all seriousness I think its pushing it to call this game a tower defense game.. I tend to reserve that title for games with MUCH less features and elements involved than this, particularly concerning tightly placed pathways. As stated elsewhere, if you have any doubts about purchasing, the first two games are on Kongregate free to play, and there is also a demo of this game on the devs website. But you don't need a demo. Did you need a demo when you decided air was good to breathe? Did you!? ;)Also I wanted to mention that til this game showed up on Steam I had no idea it existed, so there is that :> I'm fresh as a daisy to this and can already smell the deep possibilities here and have barely touched the main campaign just yet, but I still hope the dev isn't fully done adding to the main game, especially since its life on Steam has just begun.. Now if I can just muster a little focus and make time for myself to play.."
76561197971544967,Recommended,280220,28569403,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,Blackblade,"A true indie gem.  The tags say this is a tower defense game, but it is really it's own thing.  I suppose tower defense is the closest thing to what it is but it is a bit misleading.So what it is?  The premise is you have to fight back the creeper, which behaves pretty much like water pouring out of a spout (or more than one most of the time).  It slowly spreads from it's source, and is stopped by walls and higher ground until it fills up the area below and reaches the correct height.  To fight this, you build cannons, mortors, flying craft, anti-creeper producers (your beneficial creeper than cancels out the other creeper) and a few other weapons.  These are your ""towers"" but they are all mobile and can be placed anywhere they fit.  To support them you need to produce energy, which comes from nodes that cover the ground and reactors.  The nodes link up to others and need to link back to your base to produce energy and supply your troops.  Reactors don't need any ground to cover and produce more.  Troops out of supply will soon use up there reserves and will no longer be able to use their abilities.So for gameplay you will slowly spread out over the map, extenting your network and fighting back the creeper until you reach the sources and take them out with special weapons.  That's the basics but there is more.  There is a scripting language for the maps that lets them bend the rules.  There is one, non-story level where you control a man through a maze who shoots and finds keys for instance.  To top it all off, there are literally thousands of maps (most likely, I didn't count).  The main story is only a very small part of the game.  After completing parts of it other areas open up, which are basically user created maps, beta testing maps and challenging maps.  If you like the game enough you could spend thousands of hours on it, I'm sure.  I was content with just the main story and a few other maps though.If this looks at all interesting to you, do yourself a favor and pick it up.  It isn't even expensive."

,Recommended,280220,25836797,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,Misery,"Okay! Time for another review.   This time: Creeper World 3.  I'll just start right out by saying that I freaking love this one (and also that I've played it for more hours than it shown here... I hate pointing that out, but people get all weird about it).Creeper World 3 is, at it's heart, a tower defense game.  The absolute most basic concept of placing towers or turrets to defend against an advancing foe is here.  And of course you have energy and such to manage.  But that's about where the similarities to normal TD games end.The heart of CW3's genius is the enemy you face, simply known as Creeper, or Creep, whichever.  Instead of lots of seperate enemy units running at you in lanes (which ALWAYS seemed so freaking stupid to me in other TD games) the Creeper is a sort of... blue/purple goo.  EVIL goo.  This stuff spreads pretty much like you'd expect a liquid to, and the game renders/simulates/whatever this liquid really, really well, over a landscape that consists of varying levels of elevation (or sometimes, blank void areas that nothing can flow into or land on).  Your main targets in most maps are Emitters... big spiky blue things that are the source of the unending slime.   They just keep pumping it out, non-stop.  Since the Creep is pretty just a mindless liquid, it's behavior is very predictible.... but the fact that it's a liquid means that it can flow pretty much anywhere.  This is not a foe that's restricted to pre-set lanes.  And remember, this stuff JUST KEEPS COMING.  Sure, maybe a deep gorge might hold it for awhile.... but as it keeps pouring into that, eventually, it'll overflow.  It can get anywhere, eventually.Fortunately though, breaking the norms yet again, you also have the ability to work anywhere on the map.  Your towers are not restricted to specific spots like in most games, and this is the other half of the brilliance of the game.  If there's available space, you can build something there.  And most of the things you can build are actually pretty darn small... you can fit TONS of things around, which you'll be doing.Just dropping towers isnt enough though.  Like I said, the Creeper NEVER STOPS COMING.  As long as emitters exist, they'll keep making more.  They'll never stop until you destroy them.  So you cant just hold a defensive line forever.  And this is why, unlike other games, you're actually expected to ADVANCE, taking more and more territory for yourself, and reaching and destroying each emitter or other major enemy structure.  To accomplish this, your turrets can fly.  You can uproot them at any time, and give them orders to move to any other spot where there is room.  It's simple, and you'll find yourself doing it really, really often.   It's a major part of the game, and has alot of possible uses.Of course, you have your limitations.  You only have so much energy to go around, and this energy is generated by your ""network"", made up of collectors (pull in energy from the surrounding landscape), reactors, and relays, among other things.  Collectors and relays create lines between them; energy and other resources can flow along this spiderweb of nodes, usually in the form of little colored spheres or blocks.  For the most part you really only use energy when something is requesting it; when building a new object, or when an old object needs a refill on energy/ammo/ore/whatever.   So your energy usage will leap up and down depending on what you're doing... dealing with it isnt simple as your network grows into more and more of a hideous tangled mess.And there's so much more than just that... the network is complicated enough, but the game has tons.... and tons.... of different mechanics and turrets and gizmos to use or deal with.  There are things like Strafers, which arent turrets at all but are planes that launch from pads you build, which will go off and perform strafing runs against the goo in whatever area you tell them to.  Not everything is a tower.  That fact adds even MORE complexity.   On the other side of things, not every threat is the Creeper itself.   Early on you'll be introduced to Spore Towers, for instance... nasty structures that sit there for awhile charging, before letting off this huge blob through the sky towards your structures.  Or a variety of other things that exist to assist the goo and make your job so much more difficult.The good thing is, the game does a really excellent job of easing you into all of these different concepts.  The campaign is very good at teaching you.  However, one way or another the complexity is very high here.  Be prepared for a complex challenge.... but that's what you want, isnt it, from a strategy game?The best part though is that this game has incredible replay value.  After you're done with the campaign, there's all sorts of other stuff to do.  Including downloading and playing maps made by other players, or using the random map generator (which in itself is very highly customizable, so you get the sort of map you're looking for) to create new challenges for you on demand.  I've seen plenty of players get hundreds of hours out of this game... the replayability absolutely is backed up by the game's incredible depth and potential for challenge, and is something you can just keep coming back to.And one other thing I'd like to point out, and this is possibly the best part for me:  This is a very ACTIVE game.  Alot of TD games have you sitting around waiting for stuff.  But this?  No.  There's always something for you to DO.  When you're not setting up defenses, you're pushing forward.  When you're not dealing with your towers, you're expanding your network, or perhaps changing Strafer/Bomber routes, or dealing with an unexpected breach in your defenses, or perhaps using your terraformers to deform the terrain or build walls (yep, you can do that in this).... and all sorts of other things.  If you ARE finding yourself  in a dull moment, typically it means there's stuff you COULD be doing... you just arent.  And that can come back to bite you pretty hard, so you want to make sure you're always aware of your options at all times.  Really though, the game's flow/pace is superb.  Always something happening and always something to do.... no moments of sitting there and waiting.  Oh, and you can speed up time, too, if you want.  I never really do that myself though.  And there's a ton of approaches to every situation.  Your playstyle is up to you... the game generally doesnt force you into specific approaches.Oh, and a word about the graphics:  They're fantastic.  This is a colorful, VIBRANT game, where everything stands out, yet is very easy to differentiate.  It's super easy to see what everything is at a glance.  Overall I really just freaking love the way this game looks.Overall, I really cant recommend this game enough.  This is a brilliant strategy game that breaks so many of the usual rules of TD games, replacing the broken bits with new bits that are so much more awesome and fun than the old bits.  If you love strategy games of any type, if you love a challenge, and if you want some real, major replay value, something you can constantly come back to.... you'll find it here.  I cant recommend this enough.Just... try not to move your towers directly ONTO the goo.  That's just embarrassing."

,Recommended,280220,13906300,"Posted: 9 January, 2015",all,Mara,"Creeper World is technically a tower defence game, but unlike any other you've played before.In a normal tower defence game (and even abnormal awesome ones likeDefender's Quest) you'll have enemies coming towards a point or object you're defending and you're tasked with fending them off by placing towers either along a pre-defined path or by creating that path using walls or the towers themselves (this is known as 'mazing').In Creeper World there is only one enemy, the Creeper. The Creeper is afluidof alien origin and malicious intent, it absorbs and destroys anything constructed it touches. This changes the entire dynamic and feel of the game.The goal (in most levels) is to activate totems that are strewn about the (bird's eye perspective 2D) map without having your base be destroyed by creeper. Creeper flows in continuously from spawn points and you build out a network of structures from your command ship to fend off the creeper (or even destroy its spawn points). The buildings are either combat focused (the traditional tower defence type towers) or utilitarian.Because the resource system is quite different from a regular tower defence game as well (and is surprisingly similar to Supreme Commander / Total Annihilation instead), you have 'Energy' which is used to build structures, arm your towers and charge up totems. Energy is stored in your command ship and then flows along the nodes formed by the buildings you created, like a spider web that slowly grows outward (and not unlike the creeper that slowly washes over the map).A simple level progression would be to land your command ship at a strategically good location (high ground, remember that your enemy is basically a liquid so it'll flow into the low spaces first), start building collectors (buildings that gather energy from their direct surroundings) and laser towers to protect the collectors which you slowly move up with the front as the collector field grows in size (all offensive towers can be moved across the map whenever you want).Of course things get far more complicated later on, with the addition of new towers including mortars, bombers and snipers. New enemies like a creeper-formed network that will always transmit the creeper even if it's uphill, building-disabling enemies living on this network and even aerial creeper that will occasionally spawn from specific enemy buildings and head for your base.All these things (and a lot more) are slowly introduced over the course of an excellent 30 or so campaign that even has a pretty engaging storyline (the game is set thousands of years after Creeper World 1 and 2, so you don't need to know all that much from them to get the gist of things. Unfortunately they were never released on Steam. For a sample of the gameplay from Creeper World 1 and 2 (and even 3, in case you want to try it out) there are in-browser options availablehere).There is one mission right at the end of one of the two branches of the game's plot that is very different from the others though, and not in a good way. Unlike pretty much the rest of the game it has a time limit, and a harsh one at that. In the rest of the game (especially within the campaign) it's pretty hard to lose as long as you take things slow and don't over-extend yourself. This one mission completely messes that up and asks you to rush in and beat the clock. It's not a bad concept I guess, but terribly executed and I ended up downloading an in-mission savegame in order to bypass it because I just couldn't beat it.Other than that single (but major) gripe there is nothing but praise for this game. The campaign mode (which will last you a good long while) is only the tip of ice berg, as there are thousands upon thousands of additional levels that you will need a lifetime to complete. These range from fun levels the beta testers came up with, to nasty challenge levels the creator put in, to a whole universe of bonus levels, to procedurally generated levels. There is also an in-game level editor, complete with a way to directly share them with others and play their levels and tools to change anything in the game.Go give the game's free version a shot, and if the gameplay at all grabs you this is an excellent value purchase. Just remember that there's one super annoying mission in the campaign mode."

I have a few top 10 high scores (look for Seika), I've completed the story, and whole heck of a lot of missions in Tormented Space area (hard mode), so I have quite a bit of familiarity with the game.Pros:-A unique take on strategy that generally emphasizes resource and space management more than managing unit tactics, and the enemy is a rather literal tide rather than a more discreet set of units-Huge array of playable content, with a wide variety of maps.-Once you clear the main campaign, there are three main modes of pre-constructed maps. Prospector Zone has literally hundreds if not thousands of hours of content, Tormented Space exists for a good challenge, and Alpha Sector has some interesting and often difficult custom maps.Cons:-There is little to no AI to speak of. Certain types of enemies are capable of either roaming around randomly, and another will target random sections of your grid, but otherwise, the enemy will follow a strict pattern every map. Except for speed running, there is little point to replaying a map.-Music will get repetitive.There is a mute button for a reason.-Once you clear the main campaign, there are three modes. Prospector Zone is where much of the game's content lies, but the (generally) lower difficulty and lack of custom scripting means that most of these maps will get boring and repetitive. Tormented Space is not always the best tested: Some maps will feel almost as easy as the tutorial, while others are quite literally impossible without cheating (there is a thread on the Knuckle Cracker Forum dedicated to which maps are super difficult, which are insanely difficult [often requiring odd tricks in order to even stand a chance], which are possibly impossible, and which are undeniably impossible). If I have any complaint about Alpha Sector, it is that many of these maps were designed by some of the best players to be at their level, so it can be hard to make progress through those missions.The game can feel repetitive, particularly playing too much in too short a time, but the game has kept me hooked. I would recommend playing this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles and strategy, or who likes playing unique games."

It's quite satisfying to take back ground from the creeper, and when one word is safe, jump right into the next. One more level. I don't think I've played the other Creeper World games, but it feels like after years of making them they've got a pretty good handle on what makes a Creeper World game work in that regard.I've just finished the mainArc Eternalcampaign, after 27 hours. (I play defensively and pause a lot. Your mileage may vary.) The campaign is pretty good at making each level just a little different, providing some new element of challenge and giving you a new ability to use. Some levels are more different than others.The game's weakest moments, I think, are the maps that become simply an ocean of creeper. Any distinctive features of the terrain are all but lost under the sea, as you slowly entrench and advance. Maybe more aggressive tactics could prevent ending up in that situation, but since I wasn't actuallylosingthose battles, I didn't give up and try different techniques. Then came along a different map that makes things interesting again.This isn't the sort of game you play for the story. Yet there is a story, told in bits of dialog at the beginning and ending of levels, which shows some significant thought has gone into the lore of the Creeper. I might have appreciated it more if I was familiar with the other games, but it provides some interesting atmosphere.I can't comment on the other content outside the main campaign, but there seems to be a lot of it, with a strong focus on giving the community powerful tools to make more.I played this on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04). Everything ran great there; the only hitch I found is that after switching out of the window with Alt-Tab, I had to hit Alt again after returning to the game to get the keyboard input recognized correctly.To sum up: Surely not everyone likes this style of game. But if you're interested in this sort of thing (which you likely are, if you're looking into the reviews), I recommend it without reservation. It's an excellent implementation of the idea.And also very good if you want to forget to eat or sleep."

Unless you played the flash versions- then It's just more of the same, in an extremely good way. Beyond Creeper World's flash-era graphics, midi-era music, and long dialogues of exposition that seem to go on for ages, is a complex fun game that is more than your average tower defense.I feel like it would almost be putting Creeper World to shame by simply just calling it a tower defense. It's more like it's own unique style of RTS, pitting you against the mysterious force simply called ""The Creeper"" (aka water) that is constantly spreading at an alarming rate. Your goal varies from mission to mission, either a simple one such as ""Get from point A to point B, destroying everything in your way"" to ""activate these 6 thingies, go over here and kill this, and then do a loop formation with your towers and then go...."" etc etc. The game varies it's missions very well, making every planet seem like a distinct new world with it's own gimmick rather than just something thrown in a level generator. The towers are extremely situational, and I actually like this more- there's no ""Jack of all trades"" tower, forcing you to vary your strategy depending on what is happening in front of you.This all sounds very complex, and possibly at the later levels it is. But as of writing, I have not completed the first sector as I am taking my time enjoying each level, and it is quite managable. I have not tried the extra features that seem very interesting such as DMD, Colonial Space, and Tormented Space, simply because I do not want to spoil the towers for myself- but these seem all like extremely cool features to add replayability to the already large campaign. DMD Allows you to name a randomly generated map after beating it, allowing other players to play and rate the map and name for themselves. Colonial Space is a sector of space only containing user generated maps, and Tormented Space is full of hard bonus missions.Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a beautiful game so far. It's mediocre graphics might not seem like it's worth 15 dollars at first glance, but this is much, much bigger than one might expect.

I'm so glad to see it here on steam as the Dev can finally make a decent buck from his amazing efforts!What makes Creeperworld games so unique amongst other tower defence games is the energy currency system. Unlike other games that require you to save your resources, research, etc etc until you can build what you want, you have the ability to build straight away and as many of each structure as you like. The danger lies that the energy required to build, is the same energy required to fire weapons. So if you exhaust too much energy into building, you will surely die! This is balanced by the fact that the more ""collectors"" you spread across the map, the more energy you have, so there is always an incentive to keep building!Although not as graphically amazing as some TD such as Kingdom rush, Giants and Dwarves, etc or even the older Dune 3D, Starcraft, etc, etc it makes up for it in fantastic TD gameplay. The second installment of the series seemed to push for better graphics, though this actually seemed to tear away slightly from the charm of Creeperworld and I am personally glad to see an this version return a bit truer to its roots... With one great advantage... NULLIFIERS!! You can explode those nasty emitters. Something that you dreamed heavily about in the first game.There are a bunch of new features in this third game all which so far (I know it's still early for me) are very welcome imrovements. One of the best improvements has to be the TERP that literraly allows you to redraw the level!! No space for that turret... No problem, I'll just terraform some extra land in there :) It's a low price for a game that will guarantee you hours and hours of addicting gaming."

I saw this on Steam and I instantly knew I had to buy it. Plays just like the first Creeper World, on an overhead view of the map. If you've played Creeper World 2: Academy online, you'll have some of, if not all of what you need to know about the characters in this game. The story is pretty entertaining, I found myself wanting to play more every time I finished a mission.If you're one of those people that couldn't care less about the story of a game, and only care about the gameplay itself, it's got more that what you could ever possibly want. The amount of levels in this game are enough to last you for a loooong time. Each level is different, each one is difficult, and each one forces you to think about how you'll need to start. Sometimes you'll be cornered, sometimes surrounded, and sometimes you won't even have a lot of time to prepare. You would start off in an area with a high wall that has holes in it, and the creeper is advancing from all around you, you can only seal off a few of the holes. In some levels you won't have much time before you're overwhelmed, and in some you might need to use different strategies. This game will have surprises in store for you if you're new to it's universe and gameplay.As for the levels, I have yet to put even a small dent into the other sectors, as they contain probably hundreds of more challenging, and maybe even impossible levels. Even with the story missions, as I progressed through them I found myself taking almost an hour to beat them. This will be a time consumer. And on top of the other sectors, there is also the DMD, which is basically loaded with user created maps. So if you somehow manage to top every single level with the game, there's plenty more where that came from.If you've played Creeper World before, you will definitely love this game. It's all of the original gameplay loaded with levels, some new tools, a map creator, and, in my opinion, a story that will leave you wanting to continue and find out what happens next."

,Recommended,280220,20393630,"Posted: 8 January, 2016",all,kschang77,"Creeper World 3 is an interesting variation on tower offense... You build towers to limit the spread of ""the creep"", something that spread like goo over all areas of the map like the Flood in Halo, except smaller. Weapons can limit them, but the only way to stop them on a world is to destroy the creeper emitter on the world by building a nullifier near it. However, nothing can survive in the creep... thus, you need to build a network of nodes to power the turrets, push back the creep, and eventually reach the emitter and shut it down.As you advance from world to world, system to system, creeps get... creepier. They get spore throwing towers (shoots a blob of creep anywhere on the map), but you get beam towers to defend against such. The defense ""digitalis"", which was supposed to destroy creep at the molecular level, had been subverted and now creates ""pathways"" to spread, but cannons and such can roll back such until you can destroy the digitalis emitter. Runner nodes generate small runners that can suicide, but you have ""sniper"" turrets against such. Then ""glider"" nodes with weapons defend against intruders near its paths.To counter those, you get better turrets. Mortar (ignores terrain), sniper turrets (mentioned before) that goes after runners and such but limited to line of sight, beam turrets against incoming spores (some are launched up to 4 at a time), sprayer to spray ""anti-creep"" (AC), bombers to drop larger qty of AC, strafer to slow a valley of creep, Guppy transport to move AC, energy, or ore around maps that has disconnected islands, Big Bertha cannon (takes out a big chunk of creep), better control nodes (longer range) and much more.Your command module along with collectors and reactors generates the power to power all the turrets. The trick is find control terrain to limit the creep to a section of the map, then roll it back section by section, by controlling key terrain much like all RTS games, without running out of power.You are some sort of warrior awakened after millenia of sleep, only to find desolation all over the galaxy, ruins everywhere, signs of combat and creep everywhere as well, shields and warp inhibitors did not save the worlds, but your strategy and deployment of units may. As you advance from world to world, star system to star system, your encounters gets worse and worse, enemies gets more and more complicated, but you get more and more toys to play with.While graphics are low-fi and 2D only it does not distract and in fact, keep the frame rate high and creep is sufficiently creepy enough. There are also visibility options to turn stuff on/off to help visualize the battle, with zoom. However, there is no edge scroll... You have to use WASD to scroll if you are zoomed in.It is different enough from regular tower defense to give you a good challenge, but it does get a bit boring after a while, or frustrating, as energy management is crucial, and there is no manual. Read beginner's guide on Steam before getting started.Verdict: Try. It is a very unusual RTS."

Your task: to liberate planets from the Creeper, which is a living liquid substance that had flooded and destroyed civilizations for millions of years. The story mode campaign is pretty much an extended tutorial that teaches you about all of the gear and units that you will acquire along the way. Once you have gotten so far into the story mode, you can unlock access to other Zones, which is where the game truly opens up.These Zones have tons of star systems, each with their own collection of planets. Basically, you are free to explore hundreds (if not thousands) of levels of Creeper-fighting goodness. There is also a Map Editor mode in which you can create your own maps to upload to the community. You can also download maps that others have created, and rate them. If all of thatstillisn't enough, there is a ""Dial Map"" service, which is a seed-based random map generator. So many potential battlefields..So, yeah. Great game. Keep on fightin' that flood!"

It's basic yet complex appearance may overwhelm those new to the genre, but Knuckle Cracker did a good job on slowly pacing the user into the concepts around Creeper World 3.The graphics of Creeper World 3 aren't anything extraordinary but they are pretty solid. The terrain is in a variety of colors and the illusion of layers is clearly there. The various tools and weapons stand out from the terrain and are simple to realize through the variation in shape and color. While everything looks basic throughout the game, the graphics are crisp and clear - and that's good enough for a tower defense game.The core gameplay of Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is one that is new to me. While I have played other games in the same sort of genre, Creeper World 3 is unique in the sense that it's attempting to fuse both Tower Defense and Strategy-Simulation. While the majority of tower defense's have you place your weapons on a certain path as enemies start to come at you on a predictable path - Creeper World 3 is adds a refreshing twist. Your enemy is the creeper. The creeper spreads outward in all directions, covering the terrain and destroying everything in it's path. It is your job to use the weapons at your disposal to take out the source of the creeper - being the emmiters. While it may not sound that hard, which it really isn't at first; the difficulty begins to ramp up. It will be very challenging for newcomers - including me at times, but I never really felt that the game was cheating. I also realized what mistakes I made if I were to fail. Throughout the game, you will play a variety of maps with the inclusion of the story. The story arc is the weakest point about this game, it's very forgettable and did nothing to increase the immersion or gameplay. It's a good effort nonetheless. The mouse controls are also great - with the ability to pause the game, plan you moves and move your units around where you please. Overall, the core mechanics of Creeper World 3 is great and will be something for all games in the similar genre to beat.The audio is good for a game like this. In all honestly, what can you expect. The music is fine with the occasion of it being repetitive. I found myself turning off the music at various times. The sound effects are pretty simple. Nothing special here.Creeper World 3's greatest strength is it's value. Like Skyrim, Portal 2 and Torchlight 2 before them, the sheer amount of user content is mind-blowing. At a cheap price of $15, it's pretty hard to not pick this one up if you are a fan of the genre. There are an abundance of maps, both pre-made and user-made all varying in difficulty. It's also good to note that some maps have been known as unbeatable. A random map generator is also here as well as an in-game editor to create your own maps for others to try. Creeper World 3 also has over 130 achievements for those who are into them.In conclusion, Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal was one of the more surprising buys for me. I didn't think I would enjoy the game this much. It is something I will continue to play for years to come.GRAPHICS: 8.0/10GAMEPLAY: 9.5/10STORY: 5.0/10AUDIO: 7.0/10CONTROLS: 9.0/10VALUE: 10/10OVERALL: 8.1/10+Refereshing take on genre+Challenging yet Fun+Solid Controls+Addictive+Great Variety in Maps and Units+Overwhelming amount of content+130+ Achievements+Inexpensive+/- Some Unbeatable Maps-Weak Story-Repetitive Music-Can sometimes be a grind"

Taking a genre that has seen little inovation in recent years and turning it on its head. Expect a fun and challenging game, with an interesting story and a truly staggering amount of dev and user created levels. If you want a new challenge in a game type you like, then this RTS is well worth a try.A slightly more detailed opinion on the game is as follows.Creeper World 3 may be the third in a series but this is the first I heard of it. I enjoyed this game so much i really want to play the other two. The gameplay is fresh and an easy to follow inovation of traditional RTS's. With a story mode that doubles as a tutorial, new tech is introduced at a steady and not overwhelmin pace, but not too slow either. Instead of mining traditional resources you mine energy(for the most part) which maily takes space, the more space you have the more possible energy you can get, using traditional looking turrets and air craft you have to defend against an insidious liquid like enemy that flows from a central point, trying to take over the level. From a gameplay perspective this game is well worth a go if your a strategy fan, and if you simply want a game that provides a challenge without being overly frustrating then this may well be a good game for you.There are many features that will draw people from a leadership board, to simple but not old looking graphics, a different take on the RTS genre and of course the obscene amount of levels created by Devs and Users.On the probems side of this game, there are very few, there is one level that universaly hated for being bery hard and in many people's opinion impossible, this of course is wrong, its simply very hard. The repetative nature of so many guns constantly firing is very frustrating but they have made it easy to mute the sound.I certainly recomend this game as its deffinatly made it into my top favourate strategy games, and has just made it into my favourate games of all time.

,Recommended,280220,16693668,"Posted: 25 June, 2015",all,gtAngel♪,"Creeper World is a tower defense with very unique gameplay and design. Unlike most tower defense games your enemy isn't a horde of monsters, but is instead a steadily expanding mass known as 'creeper'. Defeating the creeper isn't as simple as having strong towers - you have to know how to hold back the creeper while expanding your own area of influence, taking into account the the creeper will ooze in from multiple angles and will build up in areas of low elevation to eventually climb up onto higher ground.Your own building mechanics are quite interesting as well. Instead of having independent towers, you instead build a web-like network of resource gatherers, utility structures, and attacking towers. Managing this web can get quite tricky at times, because all resources must flow through a command center and take time to traverse the network. Done incorrectly you could end up building a tower but not being able to arm it in time to defend against the creeper.Also, while the creeper acts as a steadily growing mass, the player often ends up mirroring the creeper in many ways. Collectors - the primary resource generator - are most effective when spread out, forcing the player to expand their area of influence if they want more resources to spend. There are also many resource deposits around the map which must be contested, forcing the player to expand their area of influence even more. Aiding this playstyle is the fact that attacking towers can be respositioned, allowing you to leapfrog towers to slowly but steadily push the creeper back.Overall the game is an excellent example of a unique twist on a genre and very polished gameplay. It's an extremely satisfying game to play and I highly recommend it to anyone who finds the concept interesting. Don't worry about not playing the previous games - they give more of the story, but this game is fully functional as a standalone experience."

I've played CW2 before, so I didn't hesitate to buy this game as soon as I've noticed it.What is CW all about? It's an interesting strategy, where you don't fight against enemy units similar to yours, but massive amounts of creeping blue goo. So it feels a little bit like tower defence, but really innovative one.The in-game economy system is quite simmilar to one from Supreme Commander (which I loved too!) and it's based more on flow of the resources than stockpiling them. This approach forces costant action, which is nice.So, does concept still feels to You boring? Fear not, as so far every single map is quite diverse and suprises me with something new (I've completed about 30% of game, and CW2 which was quite brilliant too!). Your enemy sometimes spawns various units too, and the goo doesn't always act like it's expected to.The game has its own plot, which is not that plain. There are no cosmic civilisations fighting against each other. There's no war, humanity lost against creeper long ago. You've been asleep for 5 billion years. All you can do is crawling through ruins of ceased race of humans, and try to make sense of what happened. Why do I even mention history in such simple game? Honestly, because at this point I am simply curious how will this story end.The only 2 downsides I've noticed are:-crappy, plain graphics. I don't think it matters though, as this simpleness comes in one package with perfect gameplay and practical interface.-lack of multiplayer. Seriously, guys, I don't care, add it somehow!What do I say at the end? Mabye I'll describe my general feel about it. This game feels like the best flash game ever, but with large campagin and saving and stuff. Buy it. Do it. I don't think anyone would regret doing it, except if it makes him fail his exams or sth."

A few text back-and-forths at the start of a level are all you get, but they deliver fully on the feeling and weight of being trapped at the end of a dead universe; alone in the empty infinity but for your sole friend.It would be nice if production values were a little higher. Sprites could be better; and the music though good, does get repetitive with it's few songs. Though the core experience is never deeply hurt by these weak points.The game's single biggest flaw is in it's dynamics. If you survive the first few minutes of a fight it becomes a rather rote process of slowly expanding your territory, until 30-60 min later you've zapped the last enemy.There are frequent small decisions to make, but very few large ones.Despite the narrative weight of the-end-of-all-things and the cool high-energy packet switching & blasting of your little empire, the game ultimately feels like a casual experience.Mellowly click away, pruning your little bonsai death machine until you've won.A fine experience, but RTS and 4x fans will be yearning for more difficulty and substance.Though some will wish it had more challenge, ""Arc Eternal"" is still an excellent little game!(And it's probably cheep by the time you read this.)Its uniqueness makes it well worth your time and money!"

The brain twisting resource management in this game is incredible and the music is pretty good too. Maps can take an hour to complete sometimes but you can save mid-game so it's amazingly flexible. Fending off blue goo is fun, but what if you want red goo? You can even customize the colour of the creep! It's really cool and super fun to play.

Some structures will launch creeper artillery into the middle of your infrastructure. You use weapons to defend yourself and push the creeper back. Towards that end, you must acquire and manage your resources. Your objective is to destroy enemy offensive structures and the score is determined by how fast you can do it.The high variety of maps presents a unique challenge every time.

This is the first game I've bought in a long time at full price,  and it's worth every penny.Creeper World 3 is a pausable RTS-type game with aspects of tower defense at its core, combined with a physics/fluid dynamics twist. The game is very well done, challenging and packed with a number of game modes, along with a powerful integrated editor. It's not ridiculously complicated with dozens of units or a mad clickfest where you need millisecond reaction times to survive -- those games are not really my style, but Creeper World 3 is very satisfying. It can get hectic, but there's always time to pause and breathe.Terrain (including terraforming), energy networks and advancing your weaponry all play huge roles, and you will definitely be pondering strategies on every map. This is not a puzzler, there's not a single ""right way"" to win each map; given enough time, often times even poor strategies can grind out wins. That translates to a lot of flexibility and support for different playstyles and setups.As the title suggests, this is the third entry in the series, so there's a level of polish and streamlining over the previous titles. There are a huge number of community-created maps, variable-driven procedurally generated maps, and advanced scripting options available in the editor to create a large variety of scenarios beyond just basic maps. You could basically play this game for the rest of your life and always see new content.

Not only is the replay potential limitless it's also really good content in its own right, some of the use made maps are really fun and if you beat it in the fastest time you get to 'claim' it as your own.If you're into oldschool RTS like red alert 2, starcraft or the aforementioned TA this the ultimate indie game, you wont get a better experience for your money.

The creeper isn't smart, it doesn't think, and it doesn't even have anything in the way of AI. What it has instead, is a pleasingly viscous fluid simulation. It flows downhill, it pools in low areas, and it can't cross high terrain without building up behind it and overflowing it like a dam. This is the key to the game. Work out where the creeper will flow, and divert or destroy it to survive and achieve your objectives.The game is one of thoughtful management. Rarely is there urgency, except during scripted missions, or if you seriously mess up and end up watching a purple tidal wave swamp your low-lying energy collectors. That's okay! The challenge is one of incremental advancement and the satisfying conquest of areas that were drowned under a layer of creeper 8 stacks high.I'm a little concerned with balance issues (there is one early-acquired unit which seems overpowered, especially in groups) but I'm content to tend my garden of creeper without abusing it, which is an unusual state of affairs."

I first found a flash game affixed on the engine used in Creeper World 1,Creeper World Training Simulationon Kongregate, and ever since then I had been searching vigeriously for more Creeper World flash games. Next up was another game created by the engine used for Creeper World 1,Creeper World: Evermore. Following up on that, I also discoveredCreeper World: User Space. Shortly after, I finally found a flash game affixed to the engine Creeper World 2 was made from,Creeper World 2: Academy. I had a lot of fun messing around with the anti-creeper there. Eventually, I learned that there was a Creeper World 3 hidden somewhere on the internet, and I looked everywhere for it. Soon, after visitingKnuckle Cracker's website, I learned that Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal had been Greenlit on STEAM. I rushed to get a STEAM Card from Gamestop, and IMMEDIATELY bought Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal without even a second thought. When I started playing, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Not for one second, not for my mom, not for my dad, not for my brother, not even to marvel at my chihuahua when he was rolling over in my room behind me, trying to get my attention. I could not stop foranyone. The story is amazingly well put together, and innovation and the quick thinking strategy it forces you to endorse while playing is absolutely indescribably amazing. Icouldn't stop playingNo matter how angry I got, or how far I progressed only to have the creeper destroy everything I have built and worked so hard for,I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING!!....

A return to the top–down perspective of the original Creeper World, this game also incorporated many elements of the previous sequel, Creeper World 2 (which had a different perspective and significantly different mechanics).While I enjoyed this game very much, my biggest complaint is that the performance suffers when you have too many units built, which hampers my preferred turtle/juggernaut strategy. On some of the large maps, even playing at 4x speed the gameplay would slow to an interminable pace. Aside from that reservation, I'd certainly recommend this game, particularly to RTS and tower defense enthusiasts. The story is bat♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy, but who plays this kind of game for the story?"

,Recommended,280220,10951071,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,raixel,"SUMMARY:A unique and interesting RTS/tower defense sci-figame. You use nodes to create webs which energy then passes through to power your weapons/defenses and beat back the ever-encroaching purple creeper ""mist"". Its addictive and you will have the temptation to go ""one more level"" everyime you think you're going to quit. The graphics and sound are adequate, but not great, But who plays these games for the graphics? If you are an RTS/TD fan, this game is defintely one to pick up even at full price. It's tiny bit pricy at full price for those who arent die-hard fans of RTS/TD games, but if you see it on sale, get it!MAIN:This game is fascinating. Its a really unique RTS/tower defense, the style of which vaguely reminds me of the Zerg in the original Starcraft. But there are no barracks for units, no movable parts. No vespene gas.You have awoken in space after a 5-billion(!?) year stasis sleep, to find that the Creeper has again rampaged around destroying humanity's galactic empire. Of course, you must stop them. Its kind of difficult to explain how this game works without seeing it, but I'll do my best:The Creepers have emitters which slowly start filling the map with purple stuff. If this purple stuff touches one of your buildings it is destroyed. You need to destroy all the emitters to progress. Sometimes there are other objectives as well.So you build a command center far away from the emitters. Then you start building nodes and weapons such as cannons. Each node creates lines to the nodes next to it, and power flows through these lines from the command center to your weapons/cannons as well as newly placed buildings to construct them. Cannons cant link to each other, but only to nodes and relay nodes. So you want to build as many nodes to create a web, then a front line of weapons to hold off the onslaught, slowly building more relay nodes and weapons as you manage to beat back the ""purple mist"".The nodes also generate energy, which you need to power your cannons and build things quickly. Build too fast, and your energy goes out of balance, weakening the ammo resupply to your cannons and allowing the evil purple stuff to overrun them.There are also specialty nodes, such as relays which speed up energy transmission to new nodes and weapons, reactors, which provide lots of energy, special weapons, and many others I havent seen yet.Theres a lot of strategy, figuring out the best place to put your nodes to create fast transmission of power as well as beat back the purple mist, but not overbuilding so you end up overrun.Missions are timed, although as of yet I havent seen any where you ""must beat the mission in (x) amount of time"", but I wouldnt be surprised if they were out there (I hate those types of missions...I'm naturally a careful player who tries to do/see everything in any game I play. I HATE being rushed.). The fun of being timed is a global leaderboard where you can see rankings of how fast people have beat the missions.The graphics are nothing to write home about, just little representations of the terrain, units, your node web, claimed territories, ect. But who cares? The strategy is what matters here, and I'll take gameplay over graphics any day of the year.Sound is the same as graphics. Its ok, but nothing spectacular. Lots of pew pew and booms.Overall, this is a unique and interesting game. There appear to be many many levels to play as well as a storyline. Its really fun, and if you see it on sale is a must buy for any RTS/tower defense fan."

No so here, the ""water/fluid"" bases enemy is faceless and anonymous, simply a fluid that floods the map as water poured over a surface would.It never does something as such. It is simply there and spreads a poodle, that your job is to clean up.So once the initial rush (catching the falling pitcher of water before it floods your house) is over, you then spend some very real world boring time cleaning up, lots and lots of it.That is not to say it is a bust, It'd actually go for a neutral on it if I could, since it does have its ups too.But in the end I plunged for a thumbs down for the simple reason that games should not be work, but entertainment, this one lacks a middle game and end game on the maps to be the latter instead of the prior."

Arc Eternal follows a well-written science-fiction plot as you fight an enigmatic foe known only as “Creeper”.You can place turrets, mortar launchers, build bombers, cannons, and terraform the terrain to redirect the Creeper’s endless flow, provided you have the resource generating capacity to sustain it all. By the end of a mission, the sheer scope of your network of energy-producing Collectors can be impressive.The campaign is lengthily with many unique map elements.

It also has some tower defense elements to it, but again, it's quite different from any ""true"" tower defense game.Like a TD, it's a game about fighting a relentless enemy that keeps coming at you along predictable paths.Like a regular RTS, you build structures to harvest resources, and your towers can move around (this isveryimportant on many levels) once they're built.Your enemy is a liquid with no ability to react to your activities. It simply spreads from emitters and flows downhill, forming pools that eventually overflow and flood the map. There's no enemy AI worth mentioning. And it's still surprisingly challenging, because there's alotof the stuff, and your resources can be quite limited. You'll have to make careful decisions about where to build something andwhenbecause running out of power at the wrong time can cause your entire line of defense to collapse in a real hurry.It's a very simple concept, with only a few types of unit, a very straightforward upgrade system and extremely barebones presentation...and it adds up to a highly addictive game with surprising depth once you get into the tougher maps.All in all, I can definitely recommend this."

Still think that creeper world 3 is a cool indi game.But if you know and liked creeper world from the flash games then you're in for a nasty surprise: it is way less about 'easy-10-min' games and much more about half-hour puzzle games.But i like the game and like it more then 1 and 2.

,Recommended,280220,10163253,"Posted: 18 May, 2014",all,Graknorke,"So, first things first, this game is not the best written and graphically designed, and that probably turns some people off. I am very pleased that I fall outside of that group because it is a terrific game. The basic mechanics are all easy to understand, shooting the creeper makes it decrease in level, creeper moves like a fluid (though I've heard it's simulated more like heat. But for all gameplay purposes you can think of it like a viscous fuid) to fill in gaps, you need to send out packets made from energy to supply turrets, construction and other things.Then as these gameplay elements start to overlap the interactions between them get more complex. I won't go into too much detail but there is a special type of terrain that promotes the creeper to flow along it. This may completely throw what you were doing previously because suddenly you have to be cautious with the fact that it is much harder to clear the creeper.The main draw of the game to me was the resource management system though, which forces you to manage between the space needed to get energy, how much you can afford to defend with that energy, and how you can expand from there. It is very easy to find you've just spent half an hour gradually shifting around units to allow you to push forwards, but all of that time feels engaging.Overall it's a very engaging game and at £12 it's decently priced for the amount of gameplay contained within."

Other units are useless and unused - well, again if they are not needed by map design.You have to employ snipers on maps with ""bugs"", anti-air guns where you are being pressed by spores, and planes/berthas on maps made of ""islands"". But that does not change your strategy, it just adds a tiny mix of certain type of gun to the ""build mortars and win"".The only mission i actually had to adjust over time was the last mission of the main story AGAINST Loki. But even then it was just a bigger mix in overwelmingly prevaling ""mortar combat"".So after a certain time the game becomes dull and the only challenge are map conditions where you are forced to do something before you can ""mortar them all"".It is a shame, really. The overall concept is very nice.---- SPOILER ALERT ----And i was able to win last mission as Emperor doing this:Move around not to get hit and destroy the right lower AA gun.Place the ship outside the range of other guns.Set time to 4x (only needed to make things quicker.Press the mouse button that fires the gun (and leave it pressed whichever way you like), so the creep is constantly renewed below the gunshots.8Hrs later (2Hrs on 4x speed) - victory, the map was  completely flooded by the creep :)The only thing interesting about it was to see how the creep and anticreep collide and how the ""fluid physics"" works in game."

76561198005406191,Recommended,280220,34822172,Posted: 8 September,all,servvsumbrarum,"Greetings as always!  So, I have a guilty pleasure and that is these ‘creeper’ games and today I’m reviewing Creeper World 3:  Arc Eternal.  If any of you have been following my reviews you may find this odd as it is an older game from my first experience of this series:  Particle Fleet (made by the same developer) but the honest reason is I didn’t know this game type even existed until Particle Fleet and I still wasn’t sold that this wasn’t a one hit wonder so I cautiously bought the game you see now.I’m doing what:  This game is an odd mesh of genre’s:  Part tower defense, part base builder but all real time strategy when it comes down to it.  However, you aren’t going to see many controllable units (aside from fighters / bombers) and even those you really aren’t micro-managing as they are told to strike an area and generally left alone (nothing in the game can actually damage them).  Your first encounter with this may leave you with a “That’s it?” kind of thought but as you keep playing you will find the complexity comes from the buildings themselves and not the core game (as all great strategy games have).Loud Noises:   Like the later game of the genre (the above Particle Fleet) the music is very good, though I do tend to turn it off after several hours of playing it.  My friends have an overwhelming annoyance with the cannon sounds…not sure why.  To be fair, the gun sounds can be obnoxious from an onlooker’s perspective.  I just don’t mind all that much as I’m usually listening to something else.  In addition the graphics are very simple; but I’m glad they are as the game is about the gameplay not the graphics or particle effects or really even the sounds (though, again, the music is really good).Multitasking:  One of the amazing things about this game is the ‘casual’ nature of the gameplay itself with the possibility of improvement to a competitive level.  That sounded a bit word-salad but what I mean is the game isn’t really ‘hard’ but more of a challenge that can be relaxing like a brain teaser and I found myself using this game as a wind down at the end of a night or after work along with watching a movie or podcast; nothing too intense.  Now, if you are trying for the leader boards then get ready to white knuckle because there is some serious optimization to be had.  In the end, however, I am happy with my slow paced game for the purpose I’ve set for it.Overall, I make no qualms in that this game is a guilty pleasure of mine.  This game is not for everyone; it can be a bit slow paced (or fast depending on you).  I’d earnestly recommend that everyone gives this a try, especially if you are a management, strategy or puzzle fan.  I also have to mention that there appears to be a near endless amount of content.  I actually forced myself to uninstall this game as I was playing it instead of moving on to other games in my library.  At worse, wait for a sale as the game does get pretty cheap during those.  As always, regardless of your decision I hope you enjoy your gaming!"

I really am missing some personality, some intelligent behavior, like f.e. in Ai War.Dont get me wrong, its not a bad game. But it is not a great game as well, but just another turret offense/defense game, which additionaly suffers under terrible graphics and a bad interface.I seriously cannot recommend it for the price of 15$, regarding what (great) games you get for that amount.Still, if you can live with the terrible presentation, and regarding the playtime you will have with this game, easily a couple of dozens of hours, just to finish the campaign, and after that, dozens of user-made content awaits, i can recommend this game, if you find it on sale..."

The approaching doom of the creeper goo gives you a survival feeling i haven’t seen many games be able to recreate.While i'm a firm advocate of ""gameplay before graphics"", i can’t help but feel that this game deserves better graphics, not to say that the gameplay is effected, but the gameplay is so nicely polished it would be great to see graphics that match the high level of gameplay, Its ovbious that the creator is probbly more comfortable with programming (I'm sorry if you're not!) which isnt nessisarily a bad thing because the gameplay makes up for it massivly, but the graphics in their current state are kind of plain and the looming doom of the creeper sludge or whatever it is, isn’t quite captured as well in its current opaque single colour state. Regardless I’ve been enjoying the hell out of the gameLastly, i would love to see more types of items to defend with, aside from using the anticreeper goo turrets and the jets, i found the game mostly revolved around the standard turrets and mortars, with some specialty units thrown in that are only situational, they're fun but more variation would be nice. Also the block building thing is overpowered as hell, really needs some sorta finite resorce to stop you from just cheezing it and building a 10 high bridge all the way to the spawners, i'd like to see it cost more or be limited somehow because it makes defending way too easy, maybe combine it with the ore production so it costs a bit more, I’m a bit of a turtle style builder but this gives you way too much control.But yeah buy this game!!"

For all of Creeper World's unique building types, interesting building connections, and neat other ideas -- you're still fighting water. The story tries to turn the ""purple water"" into a menacing all encompassing alien blob, but it doesn't behave like one. Heck, the water moves in a really non-aggressive way like waves lapping at the shore. If you want a game with AI that adpats to your playstyle, look elsewhere.The most stressful time in any given match is the first few minutes when you're building your base up. I've hit restart numerous times because of acting too slow (mostly since I'm watching TV at the same time); however, once you're up and running defeating creeper is not really about strategy or skills, it's more like a waiting game. You'll be slowly grinding out the time of waiting for buildings to construct or moving your buildings around. The only way this game is interesting is that it allows speed players to post their completion times for everyone to see.While I do fawn over pixel art, Creeper World is very dated even for pixel graphics. There are loads more mobile games that look better than this. I will say that the strongest aspect of the aesthetic is the soundtrack. I never felt bored with the music and it gives this emergency type of rock background in the environment. Nontheless I turned it off so I could watch TV and youtube."

There are no ""lanes"" or marching mindless enemies, but there is a network of towers that will desperately fire a nonstop barrage to hold back the enemy long enough for a careful strike against their resource nodes.

It feels too much like an amateurly produced indie game, even though really the game is solidly designed. Challenge has little to do with survival -- it's more like, if you screw up, you're going to spend another half an hour building something that actually works. And the mechanics of unlocked tech are often poorly explained, leading to exactly the kind of confusion that causes you to screw up. Since tech is unlocked in almost every mission, as far as I've played, the result is a somewhat frustrating experience. To be clear, I don't think this is the developer's fault -- the game is solidly put together, it's just that its mechanic tends to overwhelm and destroy when you make a mistake. I'd recommend it if you're looking for inspiration in your own game design projects -- but not so much if you just feel like playing it."

In order to still somehow write a meaningful review I've read a lot about what others had to say (both good and bad) and watched videos online.The problem for me is simple: Every mission is the same basic concept + you are not fighting against any sort of AI, but against some fluid goo which always spreads, you always stop, and then you grind your way forward to destroy it. It's weirdly enjoying and at the same time surprisingly non-engaging. You could play it while watching a film, especially once you have set up base. I can understand how people sink hours into it, just how some people sink hours into mindless point-and-click games, but I see no strategic depth here.Positive Reviews actually acknowledge that to some degree, and the ones talking about any sort of ""strategic depth"" do a bad job explaining what exactly they mean, while the bad reviews are criticising the same thing, and some of those people have clocked considerably more hours than me.This + looking at videos online has led me to the conclusion that these basic game mechanics don't change, sure there are buildings to unlock, and some tools you have to use in certain situations, but I can't see any possibility of strategic depth with this kind of concept.It would get a good review for 2,49$, maybe for 4,99$ even, I could see myself playing it for a few more hours or sometimes to just waste time, but for 14,99$ I expected more.

I haven't played the other games, but was able to get into the story and gameplay with no issues. You are allowed to save at any time during a mission and in my experience the early story missions take roughly a half hour and the later more complex ones can take an hour to two, so if you can only spare a little bit of time per day, this game is very accomodating.I normally enjoy RTS games for the interesting units and buildings over strategy, so I tend to spend more time building and upgrading than being any good at completing objectives. In this game, though, base building is the core. You are given the entire map to see, so you always know what is coming at you and what you need to prepare for. There are never sudden unexpected onslaughts of troops rush through your defenses. If you prefer to take your time in an RTS, this is a game that encourages it, with the exception of certain timed missions in the later story sections.The main gameplay is set around starting a base and protecting yourself from the map-enveloping creeper and fighting it back enough that you can destroy the sources producing it. As you progress in the storyline you will be introduced slowly to new tech to help you and new threats from the creeper, such as missiles launched at you from towers. The game does a good job at teaching you how to use your new resources to deal with new problems and then challenging that new knowledge by mixing threats together.A complaint: Many, though not all, of the buildings can move themselves where you choose, which I don't believe the tutorial missions mentioned, or at least did not reinforce as well as the other gameplay mechanics. Since buildings consume energy and creeper that has reached them will damage them, it is very useful to know you can pick up and move rather than potentially kill your energy reserve with more weapons or helplessly watch a building get destroyed.Potential negatives:Once you've established your base and are ready to push the creeper back, the game tends to be fairly similar each mission, especially after you've gotten all the buildings available through the story missions.There is one mission per planet and typically 1-4 planets per system. When it starts getting to an hour or two per mission. It can add up to a lengthy game with less variety than you might like."

To do so, you maintain an array of collectors interconnected by an energy grid that conveys construction and ammunition resources throughout its network. You plunk down turrets, which can later be moved, that feed off the grid. The goo itself has a few tricks that complicate matters, but I'll leave that to you to discover.What sounds simple ends up making for a fairly compelling asynchronous RTS. Wrapped in an intriguing story, and garnished with pleasing graphics, it ends up being a fun ride."

76561198006668383,Recommended,280220,13769342,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,Iniyari,"I whole-heartedly recommend this game. Fair warning: you will become addicted to it, and rack up 20 hours playing it in a  single week. I've played it over 10 hours in two *days*.The trailer, pictures, and even description on CW3's store page fail to do the game justice. It's RTS only in that you can place and move units while the timer is running. It's TD only in that your units only fire while sitting still, and half of your units can't move once placed. Allow me to paint you a different picture of this game. The creeper is like water that bubbles up from the ground, and you can't touch the water...because you're a cat with a lot of really cool turrets. Each of your turrets does something different. Half of your turrets aren't offensive devices; they're used to set up the infrastructure of your base, collecting resources, etc. Your energy recharges continuously, but your base can output more energy than it collects, and will eventually reach equillibrium with your input. When you start to net energy income, do you build more energy collectors, or new weapons? Eventually, you can terraform the map at large energy output, but you don't need the terraformers on constantly. Want a turret at a different location to combat the creeper? Your offensive turrets can fly. to new locations, but if your infrastructure hasn't caught up to the front, their ammo stores will drain rapidly.Each map is essentially a series of multi-step problems that can be solved in a variety of ways, especially as you unlock more turrets. Early in the game, it's pretty obvious what tactics the map maker had in mind, promarily because you haven't yet uinlocked all of the turrets. But not even half-way through the initial campaign, you come to understand the myriad paths you can take to solve each particular step of a problem. Terraforming is a big part of this: because you can literally change the shape of the map, setting up infrastructure one way opens up different solutions down the road.The two extremes of the spectrum of CW3 players are probably Speed Runners <----> Slow and Steady. I'm the latter right now, which is one of the reasons missions take me so long: I spend more than half the run-time with the timer paused. But you've got to be careful while paused: queue up too many turrets, and your production rapidly outpaces your income, slowing your entire system. The game doesn't punish you for being either kind of player--on most levels, your resources don't dwindle over time, so you could play a single map for hours in a trenchy-style of building one row of turrets just in front of your previous row. The game *does* punish you for not paying attention--being fast is definitely doable if your minimalistic solution has all of the right components.CW3 is a phenomenal example of the adage: gamers prefer good mechanics to good graphics. But don't let the 2D simplistic art scheme fool you. Not only are the mechanics solid, the performance stellar, but the interface is also straight-forward, and the controls seem pretty intuitive. Left-click to select, right-click-hold to move around the map. Zoom in/out with mouse wheel. Escape to un-select or exit out of a selection. The visuals and animations tell you what you need to know, and if something isn't working like you expected, it's pretty easy to figure out why.I wouldn't say it's a difficult game in the initial campaign, but it *is* intense regardless of your strategy. There appear to be scads of maps that the community has created that will test your skills, as will the Challenge section by the developers, *and* the custom-level editor is built right into the frakking game.Geez...I haven't even gotten to the Titans yet....  :}"

Summary, well executed, fun and satisfying game but turn the volume down.Interesting RTS that doesn't follow the usual formula.  You are fighting against a rising liquid tide and have to plug your defenses then expand outward.  Has a simple yet effective art style that conveys all the information you need.  Playstyle is reminiscent of tower defense but more immediate, at the same time levels can often feel like a puzzle.  This combination means finishing a level is usually very satisfying.  The game does an excellent job of gradually introducing the mechanics and units and the levels where they are introduced do a good job of teaching you how to use them effectively without holding your hand.  The creep behaves intuitively leading to emergent strategies that the game never outright tells you about but make perfect sense, particularly as regards the terraforiming.  You can make walls and trenches to control the flow of the creep, or push back an area then build walls around it to expand into a large pool.  So far the levels have been varied enough that each new level has made me think 'ah interesting, how am I going to deal with this?'About the only negative I've found is that the sound design.  Weapon sound effects can be very repetitive, especially when you are in the late stages of a level and have many mortars and strafers firing at once.  Also the music while by no means bad is very penetrating and booming and combined with the sound effects can be extremely irritating for other people in the house who aren't playing the game.   Easily sorted by turning the volume down and the games other qualities make this a relatively minor grumble."

To me, it is the logistics of war, abstracted into a fight against the ""grey goo"" of science fiction. You begin by dropping on-planet, setting up energy collectors and ore mines, and trying to stay one step ahead of the goo by running relay lines (think high-voltage lines) to power the various weapon systems you'll need to fight it. Cannons, mortars, sprayers, and other tools are at your disposal. Interestingly, you are able to reposition them as the situation on the ground changes. From there, it is a systematic war of resources and logistics to reach the Emitters that produce the Creeper/Goo. You then build a nullifier which charges up and fires a high-powered beam into the emitter, destroying it.I'll be the first to admit I haven't made it far yet. Two hours in, and several missions in the story mode. I love every useful goodie I find on planets and put to use as I go. I'm sure there are many others out there to find. Icing on the cake to me.

Having played Creeper World and Creeper World 2, this follows the game design of the former. While the graphics may be on a lower end than that of normal games, it provides hours and hours of fantastic gameplay.For newbies. game elements are introduced to you slowly through the storyline, all the way up to the boss map (hello Thor!). The storyline does build off CW1 and CW2, so you might be a bit lost in understanding any plot and twists. Recommendation to play the first two iterations first - they are both great games.The game allows you to freely tab out (I'm looking at you Popcap) while remaining in play, and you are able to micromanage and rearrange your defenses when paused - a definite plus. You also get multiple save slots! The speed up buttons are also a wonderful addition - anyone that has played tower defenses will appreciate speed up buttons (1x, 2x, 3x and 4x).Plus point is that all your games are cloud saved on Steam - no more having to rebeat the entire storymap and more when you change a new computer or accidentally clear your files! The Alpha and Prospector sector are two such additions which will provide an eternity more of gameplay once you finish storymode. The maps are heavily varied, ranging from small maps to huge maps - all of which will require different strategies. It doesn't feel like you're merely doing the same thing over and over again. And if you ever finish the abovementioned sectors (has anyone?!), there are plenty more user-made levels for you to try out.An average map generally ranges about 15 - 25 minutes to win. It's a great game to play in between other games for a short break or while waiting for queue times.For only SGD15.00, easily worth every single cent. 10/10"

There is however a pause button, which I use often, and it makes the game managable if you like to think out your moves carefully, or if you like turn based games.  The sheer amount of things you need to think about makes this game great, and it's not overwhelming because you are introduced to new features in a logical and smooth buildup, just how a good game should be.

You need to build your base, collect resources and build defences to protect yourself against the overwhelming enemy that quickly grows in power and takes over the whole map. When you grow strong enough, you start pushing back, shooting your way through the enemy forces. You need to make sure that your assault is well covered, is connected to the supply line and that you won't run out of resources at a critical moment.You shoot down air units and lauch air assaults and bombarding deep in enemy territory. Oh, and NEVER forget about defending your land. A small mistake can be enough to screw up your plans.It's extremely satisfying when you capture land and push further into the enemy territory, and destroy they structures. The game combines moments of despair, heroism and triumph. But there's one important detail.You don't fight humans, but blue alien mass that spreads extremely fast and destroys everything in it's path. But despite this you still feel like you fight a war against a much stronger enemy.The amount of different things you need to keep track off, the gameplay focused on tactical planning, the awesome music that's both dramatic and badass...Oh, and did I mention the crazy amount of content?

New land means new buildingspace and more energy and the circle repeats till victory.The strong side of this strategy puzzle game is, that the way you expand is totally up to you.Artillery and dropping additional bases is my recommended tactic.It is not an easy game.Players of Starcraft or similar micro/macro skill based RTS games will probably enjoy the level of APM that is needed to hunt the online highscores in this game.Apart from being a challenging and fun strategy and puzzle game, Creeper World also has an own storyline.A space captain and an ancient AI take on a seemingly hopeless battle against an alien race that teleports emitters of Creeper onto every planet which ever existed. As they try to understand the relentless hatred of their alien adversaries, the duo of lone survivors discovers a conspiracy that seems to be encoded into the very fabric of the universe itself.It tends to stretch dialogues to create tention, which works but is a bit exhausting.

It takes the gameplay of the original, and builds on it; interestingly, it gives you all of your old toys pretty quickly. The anti-creeper from the sequel makes a return, and works quite well. The level design was decent, although there were times when I felt it could've used work, and I rarely found it necessary to use more than one control node, with the exception of the timed missions.The story was the weakest part, having reduced the cast to just two members: Abraxis and his ship's AI. There's some good world building, but I think it could've been greatly expanded upon, and the twist ending was really unexpected, and felt out of place. I'm not fond of stories that retcon their own history. If you want a great story, I'd recommend playing the original, which is still the best in this regard.I was honestly hoping for a longer experience overall, but there is replay value in the form of custom community maps (still haven't tried it yet), as well as a random map generator which need to be unlocked through the campaign. Something I'd love to see is a massive map, spanning several screens in size, with complex terrain and hidden secrets buried around the map; the only time you excavate anything in game is during the last level.On the whole, fans of the genre will enjoy this, just don't expect any literary awards. 8/10."

I could lift ten times my weight before breakfast!"" Well, time for a wake-up call, sweetheart. With this simple, yet surprisingly hard to master little gem, you'll be doing war against the Creeper, an ever evolving, ever growing purple monstrosity, like the Smooze if it was genocidal and emotionless. You'll be taken back by how much strategy you have to implement to wage your war against the creeper. See, unlike your average RTS/tower defense, you can't just rush guys in and tire the enemy out. No, he'll be doing that to you. You have to cleverly work a way around using a multitude of offensive and defensive technologies. Standards like shields which protect you from the ever-increasing reach of the Creeper, to aerial units which provide ground support, and a landing pad for you to stage a beachhead against the amorphous beast. If you think you're Mr. Bigshot after hearing that, then prove it. Beat the creeper and send him to the reaper!With that all said and done, I fully recommend this game. Especially when it took me about 15 hours to complete my first playthrough. I have to say that's not bad at all. And looking back, i even had tons of replay value checking out the other game modes, such as custom maps made by the developers, and those made by the community.

The tower defence aspect of this game is great, with new weapons, reactos, and offensive technology unlocking progessively and adding more and more layers to the game as the difficulty ramps up.There is a story, which is what's driving you to keep playing missions: the promise of destroying the un-destroyable Creeper once and for all. Guided by a redoubtable A.I, your lone ship treks across the galaxy trying to unraval the mystery of the Creeper.Overall, a solid game.

Single player it can stand tall together with strategy games like starcraft or age of empires without shame.100% achievments took me 450 hours. I suppose it can be done in half that time.There are tons more content even after the achievements. The biggest problem is probably how the ruleset is almost identical on every map.Suggestions for the creator. Multplayer: Allow comments on map. Notify players when their map has a comment or time is beaten. Notify players when their time is beaten. List maps with newly beaten highscores. Rank players on how many 1st rank they have on maps. Chatroom? There is SO much that can be done for a competetive multiplayer scene in this game. The current DMD is pretty bare bones. Go steal some inspiration from super mario maker or similar. (How about co-op maps? Too difficult?)Map making: Ditch the obscure scripting language for javascript or similar. Allow multiple map campaigns that allows some progression. Where the outcome in one map can affect following maps. For example custom tech tree unlocked over several maps like in the original campaign. Or campaigns where the final map can be played from start, but can be made easier if you choose to beat other maps before it. Or variable prices, or unit prices or unit strength.

If you mannage to set up a perimeter to hold back the goo within that time, victory is almost assured.  It may be a bit of a slog after that, but there is no real risk of defeat after your initial defense has secured your base.As a side note, the global ranking chart for this game is nothing but the hall of cheaters.

What I found was a highly addictive and unique stragegy game.You face the creeper: a flood, literally, a fluid enemy pouring across the battlefield from emitters.  Later encountering corrupted machines and other new threats and rule-bending forces.  Your typical mission begins by dropping your HQ either far enough away or on defensible enough terrain to build up your economy and weapons to begin pushing back.  Branching out your energy network to lands secured by weapons fire (or other interesting units and abilities) to allow units to operate further and further afield, advancing step by step, until close enough to set up a special unit to destroy its source.The games many maps are very diverse.  Fighting on all sorts of mundane and exotic planet surfaces, fragmented worlds, moons, asteroids, vast artificial structures etc.Your economy is energy.  You recieve a constant income of energy from collectors and reactors, which require either plenty of creeper-free land or large investments of energy.  Energy functions as the building material for units and their ammo.  Losing a chunk of your income, or a link in your network of collector and relay nodes, or just spend it on doing too much at once and your weapons will have only several seconds worth of stored energy before that wall of firepower becomes a trickle, or nothing at all.The main con with this game I think is that, with the exception of a few time sensitive missions, you are very unlikely to lose once you have built a decent defense early in the mission.  Once that is accomplished, a player be as slow and patient as they like, lazily inching things forward one at a time as much as terrain allowed.I might have played CW3 that way, and been left with a feeling I wasn't challenged, and that there weren't many important strategic decisions to make... if not for one simple feature: leaderboards for best completion times.  This is one of the few games that have managed to interest me trying to get into the Top-Whatever ammount.  I recommend doing so, it greatly enhances CW3's challenge and replayability.Unfortunately, the leaderboards are polluted with illegitimate scores, particularly in the main campaign and most popular other maps.  I mean times well below what it takes to build, charge and fire a single nullifier even in the best conditions filling the Top 10's and 20's; with legitimate champs finding themselves in around the Top 30's... so at least it's still meaningful to be in the Top 100's."

The Creeper is a liquid like entity that will accumulate and destroy your buildings if your defense isn't up fast enough.One of the features I think it the coolest about this game is the terrain. Heigh can vary between 1 and 10 and will didctate how the Creeper will flow on the map. It's also possible to terraform it to create things like walls or flatten the place where you want to build.But walls won't help you forever. Creeper isn't limited to the height of 10 and will accumulate untill you destroy all the spawners.That's the basic of it. There is also a few more ennemies and you have about 11 buildings to adapt to each scenario.The main story is cool. The first half will introduce you to new features and the second half will have unique levels to challenge you, especially toward the end. The whole thing is lead by a mysterious sci-fy story.And the best part is that the story is the small part of the game. After the few hours you need to complete it, you have countless more missions to play and also user-created ones.Nice defense RTS, tons of content. It might not be for everyone but check it out!"

,Recommended,280220,24354714,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,VastBlueshift,"Verdict:Buy it, especially if it's on sale!Pros:- Relaxing, yet rewarding, RTS experience- Campaign missions are interesting and unique- 100+ hours to complete the campaign missions (probably, not done yet)- Map maker- Community-made maps- Random map generator (a.k.a. Dial Map Device)Cons:- Storytelling tries to be way too ""epic"" but is simply tedious (maybe the later missions will make up for it?)Review:This game is a perfect match for me. It's an RTS, but you basically set your own pace, so it's much less stressful than something like StarCraft. Don't get me wrong, I love StarCraft, but Creeper World 3 somehow manages to make the RTS experience relaxing and rewarding at the same time.At the time of writing this review I have about 19 hours in the game, and I've barely scratched the surface of the content available. I'm maybe 1/4 of the way through the campaign missions, and have yet to play any of the thousands of player-made maps, or the practically infinite map generator called Dial Map Device.The campaign missions are interesting, and somehow keep surprising me with new challenges. The storytelling is pretty bad, though. I feel like writer tried too hard to make it feel like a super epic novel, but it just ends up being tedious.Overall it has been well worth the $2.99 I paid for it. Having experienced it, I would have easily paid full price for it."

Anyway heres the breakdown:Pros:- Lots of Replayability- Challenging- Main campaign takes a long time to beat- Really addicting once you get the hang of things.Cons:- Challenging?- Takes many attempts at that start, because there isn't a decent tutorial.- The story is pretty negligible."

It's like a mix of TD and RTS, it's like someone looked into the future of Tower Defence and brought it back into the present.Besides the campaign and the surprisingly deep story, you have hundreds of handcrafted maps and thousands of random pre-generated maps(normal and challenging) and a map editor to share your maps with others. Basically, there is enough to play here.In terms of play styles you could go for a speedy/aggresive or tactical approach, but there is an odd satisfaction of systematically taking over the map bit by bit, freeing it from the ""Creeper"". With the addition of being able to terraform the landscape things get very interesting, going from building your own castles/fortresses to creating artificial chokepoints for the Creeper to simply making the map right out flat as you go along.All in all i would very much recommend getting it on or off sale, but as i said it's quite addictive."
76561198054082646,Recommended,280220,27953562,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,Bacon Champ,"It is vaguely tower defense...  you cannot control the path of your enemies with your towers, nor does your enemy have a path at all.  Your enemy is ""creeper"" - an obvious ripoff in name and behavior of Starcraft's creep.  It is goo which expands from a central point.  The goo will destroy your towers so you must keep it at bay.  The whole game is about first protecting your base from the goo then slowly pushing the goo back until you destroy the enemy target.  The graphics are a la 1989.  The gameplay is simplistic.  There is a lot of content, though.  If you are tolerant of poor graphics and this style of game sounds interesting, then it'll keep you occupied for a decent period of time for a low price.  I found it underwhelming, possibly because I like the more traditional tower defense, but I have played it a lot."

But this is a wonderful game that deserves more attention.Creeper world is a fresh take on tower defense games and is an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys the genre.Creeper world mixes tower defense with real time elements while also adding a number of mechanics not seen in other tower defense games. The level design and progression of the story missions is extremely well done, both in teaching you how to play the game and also introducing new elements. There is also a huge amount of replayability in this game with player-made and randomly seeded maps."

This is probably my 4th or 5th time working through the campaign, plus a couple dozen hours playing custom maps. I seriously can't recommend this enough.So, look, I'm a big RTS fan. I played the original Starcraft games in basement lan parties when I was in high school, I have the entire Command and Conquer series, and I've spent countless hours in the Age Of (fill in the blank) series. As well as some indie RTS games you've probably never heard of. There was nothing quite so intimidated as an early game Zergling rush.That is, until I played this deceptively simple game.The enemy in this game is inevitability itself. It is relentless, always pushing not towards you, but towards the whole of existence. At the end of all the wars, when the last star dies, when the planets themselves grow cold and crumble to dust. The Creep remains."

Regardless, I don't normally like tower defence or RTS, but this game is the exception to both. Maybe that's because this game takes those ideas and adds a simple but robust concept for the enemy units that you're fighting against.The best news for you is that you can play a free demo of all the Creeper World games on the web via Flash or Unity webplayer. If you want to find out what people are gushing about, just go try the demo. You don't have to download anything (other than the browser plugin), just play it in your browser. If you like tower defence or RTS, definitely play the demo. Even if you don't, but you're somehow reading this out of curiosity for this game, try the demo anyway. Take it from a guy who normally dislikes both of those genres, and just look at how many hours I've played Creeper World III.This is essentially a much-improved version of the first Creeper World. The game has a built-in map editor, and also seed-based procedural generation for random maps. This is in addition to hundreds of pre-made maps of varying difficulty.As of the time of this writing, this game still has an active community of dedicated and gifted players who are still adding custom maps each day. There is much opportunity for modding. In addition to the map editor, there is a built-in scripting language so you can essentially reprogram the game (within limitations I imagine, as I've never personally experimented with it), and I've seen players come up with some very creative ideas such as maps where you play as the Creeper and maps where the enemy has units similar to your own that are controlled by AI, maps with fog of war, maps with booby traps, and the list goes on. The mods and customization make available endless hours of entertainment."

The only reason I'm choosing Positive is because I got it on a nearly 90% off sale.  This is absolutely not worth the regular price.It's more of a relaxing activity rather than any sort of challenging game.  There's no actual AI.  It's you vs. the environment that reacts the exact same in every map.  The only real 'diffuclty' is the initial setup.  Once you figure out how / where to place your initial HQ it just becomes a matter of time as resources are inifinite.Speaking of time, the leaderboards are borked.  I have yet to see a map where the time to complete is over a minute (most seem to be around 30 seconds).It's a great alternative to Free Cell / Solitaire / Minesweeper for a relaxing thing to play on your PC, but it's pretty bland as a tower defense game."
