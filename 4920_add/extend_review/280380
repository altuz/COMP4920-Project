In most cases, id like to say at least ONE good thing about this game, but I can't,DONT BUY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥Who knows, maybe it gets better after chapter 2, but I cant get past that part, because it crashes too often"

I could get by the shoddy gameplay and the less than desirable cover system, but the bugs man, the bugs. It's crashed on me multiple times and sometimes the controls stick when you're forced to pause during the tutorial. Don't get me wrong, the idea is a really good one, I just wish they had put a little more effort into its excecution"

76561198037942558,Not Recommended,280380,9881256,"Posted: 20 April, 2014",all,Ronan,"The game itself was a good idea, you run to cover, you shoot, you run some more, you shoot some more, you do one of the other things but apart from that the game is bad. The game in its current state may provide light enjoyment for some people, but if you are expecting something great, you will be dissapointed. Graphics are like something from 2005 and the enemies move in the same way. Also it does not provide much of a challenge, unless you are trigger happy then it might be a challenenge finding ammo. However if this game was updated to something that would pass as a modern game then i would recommend it but right now its just not worth it."
76561198008413914,Not Recommended,280380,9913928,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,Shteve,"This is the Worst game I have ever played for the pc. Bugs; the AI is absalutely clueless, meaning that this ai is as blind as a bat. not knowing where you are causing it to shoot everywhere around you and missing every single shot for at least 5 seconds if you are standing still, some don't even shoot at you.Still not convincing you, what about the graphics right? Nope, with graphics at this level it's as decent as the early 2000's. You will probably notice the poor lip-syncing. The voice acting is quite poor. Even one of the charecters, named Smithy gives this game an evil eye.(The charecters, due to graphics) seem to have no emotions, and are hard to relate and attach to. The best part of this game is that it doesn't cost you to much money, but trust me, you have better things to spend that money on. 1/10"

Bad controls, lots of bugs, and just poor execution all-around. Even their promo video shows bullets clipping on a wall (0:21). Seriously, guys. Don't buy this game."

By far one the worst games I've ever played, the controls are very slow feels like Im navigating a soggy loaf of bread with a gun. The voice acting is horrible also, It seems the most time that was spent on this game were the graphic which are decent enough. I do not recommend this game to anyone, it shouldnt even be 5.99 it should be free to play"
76561198258620817,Not Recommended,280380,21466446,"Posted: 25 February, 2016",all,Captain_Crow_,"This game was a great idea on paper, but not in reality. This game should be changed to Early Access. There are levels, that you cannot get past, either due to its glitches or complexity, crashes constantly. Also there is no save/load feature. There is no tutorial, nor is there a list of commands. This game does not have checkpoints, so guess what, if you die, or in RTS battles your squad dies, you lose. I appologize if this review is harsh, however...... This game is so terrible, it ""Makes stupidity look like a bloody science."" - Lew Moran from Flight of the Pheonix"

You can be shure of that but...  this game gave me many hours of fun at a decent level for a decent price. Third-person & tactical module isn't all you can find in this game. Start little too slow but level by level is more fun, more nazi to eliminate, more place to discoverI would recommend this game :)"
,Not Recommended,280380,32617117,Posted: 21 June,all,Count Panzerfaust,I'm gonna be completely honest.There's more dialogue skips on a Bathory Album.I swear there are more bugs in this game than on Klendathu.and the aim is shakier than Greece's GDP.
