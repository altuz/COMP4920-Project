It features special abiilities, unique enemies, and room for complicated playstyles. This is not a game you will play all the time, but find yourself playing while waiting for updates, friends to come online, and during short breaks between games. The sounds get repetitive, but the soundtrack is decent. It has a tiny almost obsolete story, but being the arcade game it is, it really doesn't need one. This game is simple, but in an overall good way, but it has it's complexities, mostly those of which you will find in it's playstyles. It is well priced for the game it is. Overall, this game mixes phenomenal lighting, graphics, and difficulty into one of the most addicting arcade-like shooters to date.-8.5/10 would buy for $5 and under."

Affirming other reviews, this game is easy to learn and hard to master, I am still at the padawan level :)I like the idea of a local multi player game, but think an online co-op would be an awesome update.Thumbs up."

The content is the very definition of bare bones minimum. It was quite obviously programmed with the intent to make a quick buck. Twin stick shooters are one of my favorite genres and this is just done lazily and without imagination. It deserves to be on a smartphone app store for $0.99 and nothing more. Take a $5 bill and wipe your butt with it. No different than buying this game."

It looks like the longest game played in the online highscores is only 10 minutes. The controls aren't customizable so if you're playing with a mouse, be prepared to hold the left click down until your hand cramps, because that's the only way to fire, and you don't want to not be firing (why isn't this automatic?) The game's contrast also leaves something to be desired, as it gets difficult to see the bad guys coming at you. Also, since the screen is rectangular instead of square, enemies coming from the top and bottom of the screen are much more dangerous than the same enemy from the left or right.With some improvements, this game could be more fun. Not bad for a couple dollars."

For about 5 bucks you'll get your money's worth of frustration, enjoyment, excitement, and rage quitting. But you'll be back, trust me.Hope they add more features. But overall it is pretty addicting."

76561198023308232,Recommended,280460,10684957,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,ProvostZakharov,"This is a fun, quick game in the vein of Geometry Wars.  Art style is eye-catching, and the gameplay is rather slick I would say.  The waves of enemies get exponentially harder around 4-5 minutes, so the game is quick, with the highest scores lasting only on the order of 10 minutes.  Simple power-up and bonus system and the online ranking and personal best tracking encourages replayability. 9/10"

Although the gameplay is fun, it lacks anything special. The achievements for this game are notably difficult. (only half of the players have unlocked a single one.)If you're really up for a challenge, then buy this game. Otherwise I would not recommend it."

Simple controls once you get them with a controller, tried keyboard but just too hard that way on my laptop. The effects add a nice finish. One of the best bits in an odd way, each game is very quick as its just manic, but its really quick to get back in and keep going. Only played for 30min so far but so many goes at it, I jsut wanted to keep going. :-)"

This could be a really small time killer but I don't recommend paying the full $4.99 amount fot this title. I bought this game with a %50 coupon and i still felt it wasn't justified to still pay $2.49. It the game's benefit, it does have a lot potential but the game falls on it's face by not reaching further and developing on the concept. It could use some work and I would think they could build on this concept and makie it a little bit deeper.PROS:Controller-supportSimple conceptDecent time killerCONS:Shallow, almost no depthLack of potentialNot worth the priceControl Sensitivity"

They partially work but there's no configuration, and the advice from the devs is to use steam big picture. Not a bad, if not lazy idea except the wrong unconfigurable controls it does recognize get used with what you configured in BP too so it still doesn't work right. overall the game seems like a low budget geometry wars clone with a ripped off name. not impressed."

The graphics are awful, especially the enemies. The sounds are peircing and unpleasant, the music is awful on top of that. I have games on my phone with better aiming and controls. You're supposed to be saving this dying star or sometihng but nothing seems to try and attack it, they just go after you, the whole story is nonsense. I'm gonna sell the overpriced trading cards and delete it as soon as I can farm them."
