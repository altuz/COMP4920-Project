Simple mechanics (for a turnbased veteran at least, but not too simple that it gets booring) that are still rather engageing and forgiving.Small quick maps, that can still potentially overwhelm you.It's not X-com: Ufo Defense or Jagged Alliance 2. (Or the newer ones: Xenonauts or JA: Flashback) but still lots of fun.The turorials are nice and clear. The random newscasts are somewhat entertaining :DI have not had any problems with it so far."

This game has a lot of interesting systems and mechanics from weapon upgrades, vehicle upgrades and even base upgrades. There is a lot to do in this game and a lot to see, but most people will probably beat in a week with casual play times, a few days with more dedicated time and for the truly dedicated it could easily be beaten in a day.As much as this game is amazing, and especially with additional content currently in limbo as it's been some time since an update, I would only recommend this game at full price to people who are FANS of all genres this game caters to and fans of the Ghost Buster angle. For everyone else, I recommend waiting til this goes on sale.Personal Rating: 9/10 (charming pixel graphics, great audio, good controls, amazing game play and content.)Unbiased Rating: 7/10 (short ""campaign"", aka list of objectives, buggy achievements, unsure future for the game, steep-ish price for the amount of current content.)Also, my biggest gripe with this game is how ridiculously overpriced the emotes are, I want to collect them all!"

Until now it has been fruitless. UNTIL NOW. ""Ghost Control Inc."" provides such an outlet. Part management sim, Part XCOM combat/base strategy, this is a fun little distraction of a game. You name your starting character (My guy is Fat Indiana... you'll know him when you see him) and start your own paranormal cleaning service (I named mine the Ghost Murderers). Time passes as you sit in HQ, upgrading, hiring, firing, and managing equipment - that is until your cell phone rings and your services are required. Then you load up your vehicle, prep your team, and head out; make sure to beat the competition there.Combat is deceptively simple. Your team opens doors, turns on lights, and encounters nasty ghoulies. Hit them with your lasers until they're worn down and lay down a trap. It's pretty satisfying to wreck ghosts in a fun, lighthearted atmosphere. Your team will suffer physical (and mental) wear-and-tear, so you'll have to swing by the hospital. Your car needs gas, so you'll get that too. And obviously as your business expands, the ghosts will amp up their game. You'll need to buy more equipment and hire new people.If you like XCOM, if you're a fan of management games, or if you have fond memories of a certain iconic franchise, I can recommend this wholeheartedly. I've just got one question: who ya gonna call?PS: Do NOT call the Ghost Murderers, they are highly unprofessional."

,Recommended,280540,10421950,"Posted: 10 June, 2014",all,Jab,"Essentially a modern day non IP related version of the classic Ghostbusters game from the 80s. Great music despite not having any of the actual tracks from the movie and the gameplay of running a ""Ghost Control"" business was fun. The only catch is that there isn't much meat to the gameplay either in terms of running the business or capturing ghosts. But it's a great foundation and something that I hope we see developed further or get a fully fleshed out sequel from."
,Recommended,280540,19277286,"Posted: 25 November, 2015",all,genoforprez,"In a nutshell, what you're basically looking at with Ghost Control is not so much a business simulation game but something more akin to an X-COM with a ghostbusters theme. Just like X-COM, you have to manage and upgrade your HQ, but the HQ management doesn't really require much careful decision making or strategy. It's more like just waiting until you have enough money to purchase a thing and then purchasing it. So there is base management, but it's not complex enough to really feel like a true business sim, and it's frankly not even as complex as the base management in X-COM.You're going to be doing a lot of tactical battles in this game, and this is another area where the game is basically similar to X-COM but a lot more simplified. You have 2 action points per turn, you fire ranged weapons that have a certain % chance to hit or not based on the particular character's aim stat, and your objective is always to eliminate all ghosts. Where it is different from X-COM is that there are pretty much only two weapons at your disposal: beam guns and traps. However the guns can have different effects (e.g. pushing enemies back, pulling enemies toward you, stunning enemies, multiplying dmg dealt by allies' beams, etc). The traps can also have a range of different perks (e.g. some traps require a ghost to be on the same square, whereas others have an AoE trap effect. Some traps can only be dropped next to you while other traps can be slung a short distance toward the target. Some traps only capture ghosts, while some traps can still stun or dmg a ghost even if failing to capture it, etc).One thing that is a notably creative feature of this game that makes it more interesting than X-COM or other similar tactical games is the ghost trapping gameplay. This is a truly original idea that in my opinion is the game's most interesting and defining feature. In a lot of these tactical games where you're controlling squads of dudes with guns, you're usually tasked with shooting all the enemies until they are dead or incapacitated. In Ghost Control, all of your enemies are ghosts, so you can't actually kill them. All you can do is shoot them to reduce their ""energy level"", which can greatly reduce their mobility if low enough, but it also makes them susceptible to being trapped. Your ghost traps have a ""max energy level"" requirement, which indicates the max energy level ghost it is able to trap. But lowering the ghost's energy level below this maximum makes the trap more likely to succeed. So what you are trying to do is shoot the ghosts to drop their energy level to 0, then position the ghost over a trap to permanently remove it from the field. But remember how beam weapons have certain effects, such as push/pull? This means you can throw a trap on the ground and hurt a ghost AS YOU ARE PULLING it toward you and onto a trap. Or an ally can throw down a trap and you can use a push-type beam to push the ghost onto an ally's trap. Or you can position a ghost on tap of a trap and hit it with a stun-type beam to prevent it from escaping the trap range and boost the odds of a successful trap. This is pushing/pulling ghosts onto traps to eliminate them is an excellent way of capturing the spirit of ghostbusters in a tactical game, and I commend the designers for thinking of it.One kinda negative thing about the combat is that many of the maps are very cramped for space. You'll be fighting ghosts in a lot of houses and offices, and it really limits your tactical options when the hallways or paths around furniture only allow one ally to pass through at a time. Based on conversation with other players, though, it seems that some people enjoy the challenge of having their mobility greatly restricted in this way. Another positive is that it also restricts the mobility of many ghosts (save for a few ghosts that will teleport or phase through walls). So it could be that you'll find that to be a positive, but just know that residential/office levels put you in VERY tight spaces. The designers realized that the residential/office maps are very cramped, though, so as a counterbalance there are also park/tunnel missions that are more about battling in wide open spaces.The negative of these tight spaces is not just how it affects gameplay/mobility, though. It also means that there is just a lot of.... STUFF...  piled up on the screen. If you are using the default view on residential/office levels, it can be almost impossible to see your characters or where the possible walking paths are. There is some helpful tools in the game to cope with this. For example, walls and furniture become transparent when the cursor is within a certain range. You can also press shift to turn walls and furniture completely off. So there are ways of dealing with it, but some may still be slightly put off by the default view feeling so cluttered.In terms of the flow of the game, it does feel like it starts to run out of steam after several hours. There are objectives to meet, base upgrades to buy, weapon upgrades to buy, and of course the ghosts will become more challenging. But the game sort of has the same problem as The Elder Scrolls, where at some point you realize that the game basically boils down to 1) kill everything in dungeon, 2) sell everything from dungeon, 3) use money made from selling everything in previous dungeon to buy better things that let you kill everything in an even bigger dungeon, 4) repeat times infinity.If you love ghostbusters and you love x-com style games, and if you are fine with the old school look/feel, then it may be a game worth checking out.My verdict using the criteria below is that the game ranks around a 4..7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying itheavilydiscounted.2) Only worth checking out if you aredangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs."

The closest game I can think of would be XCOM, but in GhostControl you are running a ghost hunting company (think Ghost Busters) instead of running a secret government agency tasked with defending earth from alien attack.In GCE you'll have to manage your team, a base, and your car. You can recruit additional members for your team from your home office and must keep their sanity maintained, periodically visiting a hospital to ""repair"" that sanity. Your base is where you'll drop off your ghost goo and perform various other tasks. And while out roaming the town waiting for calls from new potential clients, you have to remember to keep the car gassed up with a few gas stations around the town.*[While the game is actually quite enjoyable from my experiences thus far, there are a couple minor issues that can be frustrating. One such issue is the fact that every time you select a team member for their turn, their inventory screen pops up in the bottom middle of the screen blocking your view (they can be moved and if you remember to move them, and not close them, on your first couple turns it's easily fixed).]*[Edit: 6/10/2014: This issue has been fixed and I haven't noticed any other real issues]All in all though, a very enjoyable game. I'd give it a solid 8/10 from my experience so far.*[Edit 2: 6/10/2014: As you can see from the comments to this review, the devs care a great deal about their game. I'd give the game at least a 9/10 now]"

,Recommended,280540,10442605,"Posted: 12 June, 2014",all,GeorgeT93,"I've had a lot of fun playing through GhostControl Inc. The game merges turn-based strategic combat with business management to allow you to run your own ghost hunting business while busting the ghosts with the team you put together. As you advance through the game, you'll be able to upgrade things like your headquarters and vehicle, as well as hire (or fire) new hunters that have different classes (such as shooter, scientist and brawler.) With an upgraded headquarters, you'll be able to pay for training for any of your ghost hunters in order to improve their skill set. The weapons and traps are also upgradeable through research, so you can improve the weapons in your arsenal as well as purchasing new weapons and traps (that can also be upgraded).A typical mission will start with a call coming in on your phone with someone telling you about their haunting, and you have the option to accept the mission or hang up on the caller. If you accept the mission, a ghost icon will appear on the map where the mission is to take place. You'll need to speed your team over there as quickly as you can, as there are rival ghost hunting businesses in the game that will get there first (if given enough time). This is where the faster vehicles come into play, as they will give you an advantage in speeding to your next mission. If a rival company makes it to the mission location before you, then the mission is cancelled out for you, and you'll have to wait for your next call. Once you arrive at the mission, you and your crew will be responsible for rounding up all the ghosts there using your weapons and traps. If a crew member's 'sanity' stat drops too low, they'll go running from the mission, leaving the rest of your crew to finish cleaning up the haunting. Once you've completed capturing all the ghosts on the premises, you'll want to swing by the hospital to cure any fears (lowered stats) that are affecting your crew, then head back to HQ to store the ghosts. Stored ghost energy can be sold, but you may not want to sell it all, as you'll need some ghost energy (as well as cash) in order to upgrade your weapons and traps.The art style is decidedly retro, and does a good job of giving you the feeling of playing the classic ""Ghostbusters"" game from the old Commodore 64 days. While I'm happy with the advancements we've made in graphics technology since the days of the C64, this is one of those games that brilliantly shows that it is the gameplay, and not the graphics, that really make or break a game. A game can have the prettiest graphics on the planet, but if the gameplay doesn't back it up, then it doesn't make for much of a game. Here, the opposite can be expected. Very old-school styled graphics on top of a great game make it a great game, period.It took me a little over 11 hours to complete the game, without rushing through. Fortunately, when the game's 'campaign' is finished, you have the option to keep playing so you can keep on busting ghosts. According to the developer, they have two more cities planned for the future (Cologne and San Francisco), so we can expect more ghost busting fun in the future. They have not specified whether the additional cities will be made freely available or if they'll be paid add-ons, though I would expect the latter, and frankly have no complaint about paying for some add-on cities since the price of admission for the main game is so low to begin with.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original Ghostbusters game on the Commodore 64, and to anyone who enjoys a game with a solid retro vibe that is a good blend of turn-based strategy and business management."

A Ghostbusters theme is really a great idea, the whole running a business whilst catching ghosts in a turn based tactial combat sim is something we don't seem to get much of, although Xcom comes close - it's still not ghosts.Some ideas I would like to have experienced in this game are:- A new city, the game promises another city but as it stands London is the ONLY city.- The option to take more than 3 team members. Some ghosts are very difficult to defeat when one of them starts to panic.- Strategies that work together, like all team members firing at the same time to trap a ghost (much like in the Ghostbusters films).I realize this is not Ghostbusters the game, it is Ghostcontrol Inc. but the inclusion of Ghostbusters themes are ineveitable.

And I admit that it's pretty fun for a $15 title. But it's not perfect.Pros:- As mentioned by others, this is essentially a cross between X-Com and the 1984 Ghostbusters game. Your job is to use energy beams to weaken ghosts before snapping them up in traps, all the while trying to limit property damage and stop your employees from being drained of their sanity (the game's version of a health bar). The mechanics seem natural and understandable, and thanks to a wide range of equipment you do have several tactical options availble to you. You also get to upgrade equipment, though it's not a requirement.- Graphics are serviceable, and the retro-feel serves the setting well.- A wide range of baddies assail you, and there's enough adequate progress and randomized maps to keep the game interesting... for a time, at least.Cons:- Still a lot of bugs, though I didn't encounter anything game-breaking as of yet, or ones that hurt my enjoyment.- While maps are varied, they aren't very big, and they often have tight quarters.- The game does start to get repetitive (though it takes some time to get to that point), so unless the developers add more content down the road, I suspect this game won't have the longevity of X-Com.- The one major complaint: the dialogue. The developers were trying to capture the same comic feel of the Ghostbusters franchise, but... they fail. Your team constantly quips about the situation, and the quips are pretty painful cliches. Thankfully you can turn them off if it becomes distracting.Verdict: it has its problems, and it could use more polish and content. But hey, I had fun. You want some cheap spirit-blasting fun?

,Not Recommended,280540,34104472,Posted: 8 August,all,Annoying Old Party Man,"Ghost Control Inc seemingly has everything going for it. It's a game where you essentially play team manager for Ghosbusters! And it has a nearly-perfect blend of tactics and management gameplay! What could possibly be more fun?Unfortunately, the game is marred by several issues.Firstly, the art direction is uneven at best. Most of the ghosts have very uninspired designs that won't stick in your mind like those of other franchises involving catching ghosts. Several of the ghosts are just recolors or slight redesigns of the lower level ghosts you fight early in the game, so they're both boring to look at and repetitive. This also makes it slightly harder to tell what you're figthing at times.Secondly, the writing is just atrocious. This isn't a story-driven game by any means, but there's still quite a bit of text, both in item/ghost descriptions and in the dialogue where you're offered missions. It often tries to be humorous but falls incredibly flat, to the point where you'll probably stop reading it after a while. There are also many spelling and grammatical errors throughout the game. The dev team's native language is obviously not english, which explains this problem but doesn't excuse it, as they should really have hired someone who could do a better job localizing the text.The poor writing also affects the central story, such as it is. Certainly, the real story of the game is just managing your team, but there is an attempt at a mounting threat, but it's very bare bones and unengaging, and marred by more failed attempts at humor. Again, a certain other ghost-catching series knew how to build up a supernatural threat...Lastly, the game is just incredibly janky and buggy. Crashes are relatively common, items will sometimes not equip properly, the interface will ignore your input, performance will start chugging wildly after playing for more than an hour, certain items and features won't unlock when they're supposed to, and most importantly, saved games will load incorrectly, switching character positions and stats around willy-nilly. It's a very frustrating experience to try to play a full campaign, as the game becomes less and less stable the more you progress and save.While I would love to recommend this game, I simply can't in the state it's currently in. Some of the problems are down to personal taste, but a buggy game that doesn't save your progress is something that no one should buy."

You start off with a small team of ghost hunters armed with vacuum cleaners and repurposed radios as their tools to hunt the paranormal, and are given a single objective to work your way towards: earn this much money, buy a new car, buy better facilities, etc. Calls come in Ghostbusters-style of locations being haunted, you try to be your competitors to the job (with mixed results), and then the game becomes XCOM where health is replaced with ""Sanity"".As per XCOM, you can upgrade your weapons, progressively buy better equipment, upgrade your car as well as buy better cars, and even expand your base. It's very involving.But there's just one thing holding this game back: the bugs. Holy crap, is this game full of bugs. And now, a list:-Items not transferring to an inventory slot even though it counts against your Action Points only to show that yes, the item did transfer.-Items duplicating themselves and eating another item when you try to swap them.-A team member's entire inventory copying itself to another member when you only wanted to swap one item.-And, the one that drove me to do this review, a team member getting stuck on a tile while walking from Point A to Point B whereupon the walk animation loops itself and the entire game becomes unplayable. I couldn't move other members, I couldn't issue a different command, I couldn't end my turn, I couldn't even quit the game. The only way I got out was by going to my computer's Task Manager and manually ending the game.So, yeah, the game has some issues, but it's still a really fun game. Aside from the last one on the list, none of these issues were game-breaking or eye-gougingly angering.Pick it up while it's on sale, only get it for full price once they've fixed the bugs."

The graphics are fun in their own retro style, and the theme works very well with the nostalgia look, but there are some definite rough patches. First and foremost is the cramped level design; I understand urban encounters are the goal, but most of the designs don't allow creative solutions or flanking for strategy. Put a tank in front, give him/her a big gun, and seal the exits. This is not to say the game isn't challenging at times, it's just that most of the challenge comes from conquering high health or high damage monsters.On the positive side, the gameplay works well and doesn't try to be an epic adventure. It's a point and click combat mechanic based around a goofy B-movie universe. On that metric, GhostControl is a huge success. There is a charming and easily immersive core underneath a very bland exterior. I would recommend it, but be prepared to play for 60-90 minutes at a time. Anything more than that and the game starts to feel a bit tedious."

,Recommended,280540,12153135,"Posted: 19 September, 2014",all,BSLeavingLasVegas,"A surprisingly fun X-Com-style Ghostbusters homage.The Gameplay takes the driving mechanic of the original Ghostbusters game from the NES, Master System, Commodore 64 era, adds an X-Com battle element and douses it all with a lot of ghostbusting-themed items. Mostly reminiscent of Ghostbusters, there is some Scooby-Doo and other ghostbusting TV show and film references, such as the use of weird, homemade ghost-hunting items that has been a long-running trope far before the Ghostbusters film was made.In the game, your characters have Sanity instead of health. Once your Sanity gets dangerously low, the character will panic (saves vs Morale) and try to flee. If they lose all of their Sanity, they go insane and it's off to the looney-bin for them (they're dead, Jim)! There are 6 attributes: Sanity (health), Strength (carrying capacity), Constitution (affects movement), Aim (shot percentage), Morale (saves against fleeing), and Intelligence (not sure, will amend when I find out).There are quite a few items that unlock over time, you can get better cars, your characters level up, you can expand your base, and you can even have your Scientist upgrade certain items to make them better. You will receive jobs through your smartphone, which also controls options, saving, an encyclopedia of the ghosts you've encountered, team management and some other stuff. On the overland map, you have a base, gas stations, a car dealership, and the item store that you can visit. And you're not alone in this map, either. There are two rival ghost exterminators that will take up your jobs if you don't get there quick enough. Basically, you can't just take a job and then sit around. There are linear objectives that will unlock more things over time and present difficult boss-missions.The graphics are sprite-based and not that amazing. Very simplistic, very cartoon-like, and very much from the Commodore 64 and NES era. Sometimes, the environments can get a bit cluttered, but there are visual modes to hide walls, hide objects, and hide everything (including doors). Ghost types are varied and there is a bit of tactics that can be used trading off damage to push and pull the ghosts towards traps. Some of the levels are small, and some are bit more open, but there usually isn't too much open space, so you need to plan out your movement well. There is a good deal of map variety. You will, obviously, repeat maps, but enemy setups will change and the variety is fairly large. While in combat, you can sometimes destroy furniture, and certain ghosts will destroy furniture, too, such as poltergeists. The amount of furniture destroyed will affect your payout and if too much furniture is destroyed, you will lose the mission.Sound is simple synth bit-tune stuff, again reminiscent of the older days of games. The music is entertaining enough. It never really grated my nerves, but it is bit-tune kind of music, so don't expect too much. Sound effects are similarly synth-like, and certainly passable. I doubt anyone is going to be knocked over by how amazing the sound is, but it isn't bad and fits with the whole retro motif. The barks from the characters can get rather repetitive, but that's true of nearly every game that has barks.I've enjoyed the game a lot. It is simple, and there can be times where navigating the maps is a bit more difficult than it should be, but the game does have a lot of depth to it and it does provide a challenge. The sound and visuals all give a solid retro experience, which can be a turn-off for some, but I think it provides a lot of charm and it feels, overall, fairly consistent. The enemies are varied enough that even when you play the same map again, it never plays out the same. Tactics are surprisingly varied, especially once you unlock some of the slingable traps.I would definitely recommend this title, especially if it on sale."

Reminds me of Ghostbusters (which I think it's suppose to) and the one liners the characters say while on a job are funny. The team managing isn't too complicated and is fairly straight forward. Though I will warn you once you upgrade from the 1st to the 2nd headquarters the ghosts get harder so make sure you've got your team well kitted out before you upgrade or you'll have a hard time with the tougher ghosts.

Any nervousness goes away and not much of a challenge is left.  I believe there isn’t much of a game once you hit that point and nothing to really drive towards with all of the bust and making money.The best part of this game is the art, music, and honestly the humor. I found a lot of it charming and had fun with it for a few hours.Mostly I would recommend, as is, if the price comes down.

It hits all the high notes, you have an HQ, a car, gear and you can upgrade stuff. You go out on jobs and try to catch ghosts without wrecking up the scene too bad.If it had actually come out 20 years ago it would be pretty cool.Unfortunately, while it covers all the surface expectations the gameplay itself feels really, really shallow. The actual missions are slow and wrote, the commands you give your little busters aren't robust enough to really amount to much more than ""Stand here and shoot the ghost until you can trap it"" which involves walking up and sitting a trap right underneath it. You will do this over, and over and over again.If you really need that feeling of owning a Ghostbusters franchise, this will scratch that it, but it won't hold you attention for long. I didn't even manage to upgrade my car before the 'busting' got tedious enough for me to walk away.Recommendation: Sims 3 with the Ambitions Expansion has a Ghost Hunter career that, if you stick 4 sims with it in the same house, provides a much more satisfying Ghostbusters sim.TL:DR - 3 Unlicensed Particle Accelerators out of 5, A diehard fan might get some fun out of it but even then you'll be struggling to keep interested."
