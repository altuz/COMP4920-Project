This game really manages to find the sweet spot in terms of difficulty and mechanics. It also feels really modern while staying true to the old school roots of the genre. The controls are super smooth and they really couldn't be more responsive. The graphics are also smooth and nothing ever feels confusing. I really like the simplicity of the art style as well. The soundtrack is awesome and very appropriate. Everything just blends really well with this game and feels refreshing. If I'd have to point out a downside it would be the tutorial which isn't necessarily the best. But the game gives you enough feedback for you to figure out all the details of what's going on. Finally, just check out the feature description, there seems to be something here for all sorts of fans of the genre. It really is glorious to see all this shmup greatness running at 60fps in HD. It would be a sin not to give this one a shot if you're into bullet-hell."

What it isn't is groundbreaking, or genre defining. What it is, however, is a master class training program into danmaku shoot 'em ups, and it does it so well i challenge anyone to deny they've improved their skills while playing.You may have seen games such as Touhou Project, recent Cave titles, or general Japanese Doujin releases and thought ""it looks amazing, but i would suck"" - this game is for you! DU2 lets you get used to things, before making you work - something a lot of these styles of games lack. I've been playing ""Danmaku"" games for years and was pleasantly surprised at how configurable this title is, and how much it wants you to get better.This game is one of the most configurable Shoot 'Em Up's on the market - it goes from easy peasy, to OMFGWTF just happened in a few clicks - catered to your needs, and all the while throwing bullet patterns at you that you will recognise in other such games. Training ;-)Danmaku Unlimited 2 makes you a better shmupper by design, so if you are so inclined, you'd be stupid not to play it.BTW, it has a great soundtrack too!

Yes, you read it right: newcomers. If you're new to these kind of games, don't be afraid of all this barrage of bullets you saw on the screenshots; there's an easy mode to start and you can use continues. Between each playthrough you'll rank up and will be able to buy more lifes, upgrade your weapons, etc.You can choose to play two full-featured modes (""Classic"" and ""Burst"" - the latter is score oriented) and two extra modes (""Boss Rush"" and ""Free Play""). DU2 has only five levels, but they have good replayability.This game works well with keyboard, Xbox 360 controller and generic joysticks (it even has DirectInput as an option). The soundtrack is top-notch will keep you on the edge of your chair during your playthroughs.If you always wanted to try a bullet hell game but don't want to spend much money on something you might not like, I suggest you to try Danmaku Unlimited 2. You'll probably enjoy it. Also, It's cheap enough at the full price and an absolute steal when it's on sale."

The pattern and level designs play a lot like what you'd expect from a Cave game (medium speed static boss patterns, lots of aimed shots from small enemies, big guys who cancel bullets when dead), though with some slight Touhou influences (bosses divided up into spell-cardish patterns, grazing for score), and some really clever and creative pattern designs that just feel really fun to play on a fundamental level. The stages also feel really expertly crafted with a lot of risk/reward desicions and a great sense of pressure.The aesthetics are also quite nice. The graphics look great in motion, and the environments and effects are pretty colorful. The music is also top notch, done by a doujin/indie group called Blankfield/Warinside that do heavy metal arrangements of classic video game tunes. Their stuff is lot heavier than most video game heavy metal, but still very melodic and catchy.If you've played any Cave or Touhou styled bullet hell shooters, you probably have an idea of what to expect here, but the execution is really top notch to the point that I'd recommend it over some Cave games."
,Not Recommended,280560,13867162,"Posted: 6 January, 2015",all,Bonus!,"Given the high praise this game received, particularly as a smart phone game, I was curious to check it out on the PC. Sadly, I fell rather disappointed by this game, and consider it to be severely lacking. Even among independently developed games it can’t measure up.The game itself seems okay at first sight. You get a modifiable fighter plane with weapons — straight shot, homing shot, wide shot — that you can mix and match. There are two scoring modes, Burst and Classic, and four difficulties each. Following STG convention, the game has five stages, with mid and end bosses, and if you finish the game on one credit on at least hard’, you’ll face a ‘true last boss’ as well. As a bonus, there is a boss rush mode, and a free play mode for those who like to credit feed through the game.While Danmaku Unlimited 2 follows the STG formula in broad strokes, it sadly goes awry in many, many areas. Let me describe some of the problems I’ve had with it one by one:1) The music is incredibly bland and does not synchronise with the action on screen at all.2) There are very few sound effects, not even for basic actions like shooting.3) The shield system is poorly thought out. If effectively acts as a life bar, meaning that you can take several hits. However, if you slip, you lose the ship. This seems needlessly punishing. As I'll describe later on, there are situations where it's easy to trip up due to design flaws of the game.4) Bullet visibility is pretty poor. While you can tell bullets from the background, there is not enough contrast. Have you ever wondered why in Cave games the bullets have garish colours, while the backgrounds may even seem a bit washed out? Here, bullets and background are often in similar colors. This problem might have been prevented had there been actual background images instead of mostly static colors.5) Further, I am not fond at all of how some of the bullets overlap. There are instances where smaller bullets move underneath larger ones, so while you focus on avoiding the larger ones, you may get hit by a small bullet that just emerged underneath it.6) In many STGs, there is a dead zone around turrets, meaning that if you’re getting close, they won’t fire. In Danmaku Unlimited 2, this is not the case, which means that as you move past a large space ship, you may just get hit without expecting it.7) What I also find very unfortunate is that smaller enemies don’t get invincibility frames. Particularly in stage 5 it may happen that you get hit because you didn’t memorise yet that you entered a part of the stage where a swarm of small enemies enters from the side. Those deaths through collision punish players who have not yet memorised a stage, and are a sign of poor game design, in my opinion. A good counter example on Steam is Crimzon Clover, by the way, where enemies that fly into the screen can’t hit you for a few frames.8) Overall, the difficulty is really uneven. Some boss patterns in later levels are laughably easy, just to be followed by much trickier ones. In a carefully balanced STG I expect something different.9) I strongly dislike that I have to unlock game features. This means that you start out with an underpowered fighter, and have to earn in-game currency (thankfully no IAP), to unlock more lives, continues, or more powerful weapons.10) There seems to be a bug: When you 1cc the game, you end up at the title screen, but you don’t unlock any achievements, or get any of your in-game currency. However, if you then enter a new mode, and exit prematurely, then the game records your progress.11) Minor quibble: I would have appreciated if the game let me skip the credits.12) The high score boards are hacked, which is always unfortunate, as it shows a lack of support of the developer.13) The scoring system is poorly thought out, since a few successful actions completely negate the entire rest of the game. Some people are upset because in Cave games it is often the case that you score more in stage 5 than in the entire rest of the game, even though stage 5 normally is a lot longer and has a lot more enemies, so it’s pretty much justified. In Danmaku Unlimited 2, though, your score depends on something like a minute or two of play time in total.*** added ***14) The achievements with point values seem broken. I just reached 1 billion in total,  but it didn't activate.15) Some bullets, like the hexagons, are incredibly poorly designed. Those only harm you if you get hit by the center, meaning that the hitbox of your ship can safely sit on a large part of the area of those bullets. Another example are the large bullets in the last phase of the stage 5 boss. However, those have no demarcated center. Just like with the other bullets, if you don't know this, then you think those boss patterns are a lot more difficult than they are.16) The transition from iPhone to PC should have led to changes in the control setup. On the phone, the speed of the ship is relative to the speed of your finger. In this version the ship has a relatively high default speed, and to slow it down, you have to use the burst shot. This is fine in Classic mode, since that shot is available without limit. However, in Burst mode, you can only slow down by activating a burst shot with a separate gauge that has to be filled. If the gauge isn't high enough, the ship does nothing at all. This means that some boss fights, where you have to weave though tight patterns, are incredibly tedious, and take a lot longer than they otherwise would.Considering all those issues, some minor, some large, I simply cannot recommend Danmaku Unlimited 2. There are other STGs of much higher quality available on Steam, or on consoles. My personal recommendation on Steam is Crimzon Clover: World Ignition, which is also independently produced, and one of if not the best STG around.I'd recommend this game to people who think that touch screens are a superior input alternative for STGs, those who think that superplayers can dodge rain, and those who consider Touhou to be the pinnacle of this genre. Danmaku Unlimited 2 is not the bullet hell you need, but the one you deserve.2/10"

I could be mistaken with my points.- The tutorial is a bit of a joke. Unless of course, it's intentionally sparse, and part of the fun is figuring stuff out.- Considering how there isn't a focus fire button, and you have to get particularly close to the bullets for the graze to register, grazing is hard as balls in this game. If you're an agressive grazer like I am, it might be a little frustrating.- The stages feel a little long, the enemies a little too indistinguishable from one another, and wave progression barely identifiable (That's a crap ton of clouds!). The pretty backgrounds don't offer much in the way of landmarks, so it's hard to get a sense of how far into the wave you are at times. And because you don't have that extra bit of information to rely on to remember stage patterns, you gotta either play reactively (which is terrible for serious scoring), or memorize enemy patterns (which is a bit of a chore since the stages can get quite long). The music's pretty good, but in light of how you can't get cues from the music because it doesn't really sync with stage crescendos, which hampers with the gauging of progression as well, it isn't as enjoyable as it could've been.- The ""unlock more power-ups for your ship as you play"" mechanic is interesting in theory, introducing a sense of persistence in the game, but good god, do I hate flying a gimped ship that requires grinding to power up. I mean, if the entire arsenal weren't locked behind an arbitrary currency system, and you could gimp your own ship for higher score multipliers, that might've been a more engaging experience.It's a pretty game, sounds really good, and has kinda interesting bullet patterns and mechanics, but these were a couple of things that kinda bothered me. There are a few minor technical ｎiggles (Dammit censor, that's an actual word), but nothing terribly major.But seriously though, playing through every round in one sitting does feel like a drag."

Firstly, I don't really understand why there isn't any bomb system. Seriously, it's one of the core elements of bullet hells. It kinda feels like playing FPS without crouching and jumping. Secondly, the game balance is a bit broken. It's not like it breaks your experience completly, but it certainly interrupts flow of the gameplay. For example - let's take third level (I'm talking about hard and extreme difficulty). At the beginning the game literally grabs you and smashes you to the ground. You have barely any space to move because bullets are everywhere plus it's really easy to fly into enemy ships coming from bottom of the screen.

To delve into pseudo-philosophical babble, the game is like staying calm and steadily making your way amidst ""chaos"" - which never is real chaos but a proper pattern. While the ship mode is large, only the small hitbox (""core"") must avoid being hit by the bullets.For danmaku veterans, this game is a rather welcome addition to Steam's library. Its visuals are clear and the supported resolutions include 1920x1080 (apparently the largest), although the in-game ship models aren't anything to write home about, somehow reminding me of the ones in Tumiki Fighters/Blastworks. Controlwise, at least XBox360 controller works without any configuring and the buttons can be rebound.As an absolute must for this type of game, it has online leaderboards on Steam for each game mode and difficulty level separately.Let's compare this with the eXceed series games, especially 1 and 3. For one, the graphics do not include pretty girls at all. Plot? There is no apparent plot. There are no bombs either: there is the ""trance"" mode, which increases (or multiplies) the score multiplier for a moment and allows the player to rake in much higher score, and a forward-facing cannon that can also destroy bullets and increase the multiplier. There is no autobombing option.A feature brought over from other game genres is that while there are no collectible powerups that I have seen, playing the game will increase your rank and reward you with additional customization points to be allotted at the start of the game to, say, the number of continues, shields, lives, weapon levels and so on. Career progression ahoy!Speaking of shields and lives - dying will reset the multiplier, as will changing the level, but getting hit so that the shield absorbs the bullet will only decrease it.There is no ""slow"" or focus mode either: the ship moves always at the same speed.There are four game modes (incl. free play and boss rush) and four difficulty levels.Unfortunately, the music is a bit lackluster and apparently cannot be changed - I would've liked to replace them with some other tracks, but alas, no such luck.The biggest problem I see with the game is that it lacks 'soul', so to speak. It's almost on the same level as Kenta Cho's abstract shmups, and just aiming for a high score is not necessarily enough justification for people to clear the game even the first time. The enemy ships being rather bland also doesn't help the situation.Even so, this is a fun danmaku and worth the price of purchase."

Anyone who likes the gameplay of a Cave shooter or one of the many main-series Touhou games will feel right at home here.Gameplay comes in two flavors, the Classic style with regular and focused shooting modes, and the Burst style with a bullet destroying laser in place of focused shooting. There is no slow movement mode so the player must be extra careful while manuvering through the many concentrated bullet curtains.The scoring system goes unexplained in the game's built-in tutorial, so I'll give a brief overview. Classic style has point items and multiplier items drop from defeated enemies that must then be collected before they fall off the screen, with them being collected when they touch the large circle surrounding your ship. The Burst style has automatic pickup of all items dropped, but requires the usage of the laser weapon to obtain multipliers, with enemies only dropping them when destroyed by the laser weapon. The Burst style also quadruples your multiplier while the player has activated DU2's Trance Mode, which while available in both styles and upgrades all dropped point items to the highest level, only has the quadrupling boost in the Burst style.The game features a ranking system, where by playing the game and levelling up you are awarded points to distribute amongst your ships weapons, shields, extra lives, and available continues. The only complaint I have about this system is that you cannot reduce available continues to Zero, slowing down the ability to restart the game for the one credit clear (1cc) fanatic.Difficulty wise, the game starts out easy and gradually getting harder as you go along, but with an extreme jump between the 4th and 5th stages. I personally found the 5th stage boss to be incredibly easy in comparison to its stage, but I imagine that the developers saved the difficulty for the true final boss that I am unable to even face at present due to being bad.Overall, I reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys shmup gameplay. Storywise the game has almost nothing going for it, with the remnants of a planned story remaining in the game just to add some spice to the game's opening act.[Cleared Burst Mode on Normal using continues to complete final level, Cleared Classic Mode on Easy without using continues]"

Said laser will proceed to wipe out almost every bullet it hits, and give you a multiplier based on that.DU2 is also abound with customization. You got the standard wideshot, focused shot, and tracking shot for your ship, and you can spend points to upgrade their effectiveness. The way you level everything up is nice as well. As you progress through the game (and inevitably die), you'll rank up and that gives you points. These points can be spent on the three addons, giving your ship more hitpoints, more lives, and continues. Points are never lost, only spent, and can be retracted to spend on different parts. At the rank of Major, I prefer having full life points and as many lives as I can. DU2 allows for intense customization options, and lets you personalize your playstyle to a great degree.I'd say this is the best $5 I've spent on a game in a very long while, and is well worth it.Update : Finished the game.i hate this game so hard, but it's so good."

,Recommended,280560,9599929,"Posted: 22 March, 2014",all,Jump n' Shoot Oni,"As a person who enjoys playing shmups and bullet hells in general (even if I may not be exactly 'good' at them), I have to say I am super impressed by this game. This game has all of the things a shmup should have: Smooth mechanics, responsive controls, wonderful visuals, clear differences between enemy fire and power-ups, great music, and a difficulty level that is not too difficult nor too easy which still ramps itself up at a pace that makes the game enjoyable and not boring. I'll admit I've only played a little on easy mode to test out the game, but I highly doubt the other difficulties will be any different in terms of the smooth upscale in it's difficulty.I haven't done a whole lot with the customization, yet, but it seems to be very well done. It doesn't require an over-reliance on micromanagement nor is it too simple that it's a non-issue. The actual game mechanics are also simple and small enough that it doesn't bog down the entire game, but still not minor enough that it makes the game super generic. All of this means that you can certainly play the game how you like depending on your play-style (I, generally, play more with focused weaponry and just watch my ship to dodge instead of focusing on enemies, and the game screen is clear enough to do this quite well and doesn't throw too many stupid curveballs at you that make this tactic ineffective.).Also, as I said before, the game looks very clean and plays very smoothly. Your ship, enemy ships, power-ups, and enemy fire are all clearly defined so you won't find yourself flying into an enemy bullet while thinking it's a power-up very often, which is a pet peeve of mine for shmups. Pretty much if you fly into a bullet, it's your fault and you can't really blame it on the visual definition even when the screen starts getting wild. The controls are also very tight, if you tap an arrow key you move just that much and you don't end up floating too far to the side and screwing yourself over. Basically it's perfect for a bullet hell.10/10 would danmaku again."

The developer definitely understands what makes a shmup fun to play.Some good items:1) The game mechanics and scoring system is explained in a tutorial.  No need to scrounge shmup forums just to learn how to score correctly.  It's also pretty open ended in execution, leaving lots of room for experimentation and pushing you luck for a little more juice.2) Bullets have great color contrast and stand out well from the background.  Coupled with some interesting bullet patterns, it's makes navigating attacks satisfying and fun.  Oh, and Hibachi dishwasher on level 4! (for those who are familiar with it)  :D3) The difficulty selection makes a noticeable difference.  For those who want an easy mode, yeah it's here.  Or crank it up for some balls to the wall challenge.Some things I'd like to see in updates:1) Unlike the shot buttons, movement keys aren't configurable.  I need to run a 3rd party app just to trick the game into accepting the configuration I want to use.  This is a common problem with doujin shmups so I'm mostly used to it by now, however an in-game config would be handy.2) Arcade mode isn't a true arcade mode, as you can still carry over extra shop purchases to the next game.  A real arcade mode that starts the player over completely from scratch every game, with level design balanced around that constraint and a separated score list, would be a nice addition."

Grazing is important here (see NineByNine's review for details), so as someone who enjoys grazing so much that I often end up doing it even in games where there's zero reward, I'm very pleased.I've got one major complaint, though - the point items are way too big! Visual distraction is a given in danmaku, but when the point items are bright blue and bigger than most of the bullets, it feels like nothing but a cheap way to increase difficulty. Sometimes it makes deaths feel like they weren't your fault and didn't have much to do with your actual skill level, and it really messes up the whole ""if you die it's your fault, just keep trying and learn the pattern and then it'll feel amazing once you beat it"" thing that makes danmaku so fun and rewarding...

What DU2 makes up for however, is an upgrade system very akin to Beat Hazard, in that the more you play, and the better you score, the higher a rank you will achieve, and the more points you will have to upgrade various elements of your ship.My only complaint however is to do with the audio -  a minor issue.I feel the heavy guitar fits the setting of the music, but I feel like it's too much, and can become bland, or jarring to a degree - a little melody here any there could have really made this soundtrack more memorable. Secondly, the SFX seem slightly lacking, I've yet to tweak the audio settings, but at default, it's as if your ship has no firing SFX, putting more focus onto the BGM which doesn't particularly help, and could possibly break immersion.Other than that, you get a very good experience for your money, the game feels, and DEFINITELY looks the part, so I see no reason why I shouldn't recommend this to anyone."

,Recommended,280560,9997079,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,ballzac314,"Exceptional example of the genre!###Graphics - Typical of bullet hell games, the graphics are not demanding, but they are beautiful nonetheless. I'm used to cartoony (mushihimesama) or pseudo-2.5D (ketsui) graphics, but DU2 focuses more on high contrast and slick, crisp graphics. The background are dark, and the projectiles are neon-coloured. This makes it very easy to spot, and dodge, them.###Gameplay - Very similar to cave games, in particular something like dodonpachi daioujou, but this doesn't have the feel of a clone. While many of the bullet patterns will be familiar, the creators have pulled off the feel of a classic bullet hell and added some unique personality to it. The difficult covers a good spread of ability. People new to the genre will be challenged by ""easy"", but not so much that they will give up before completing it. For even casual players who have some experience with bullet hells, ""easy"" will be a walk in the park. Experienced players will find ""extreme"" challenging, and only the most serious fans of the genre will be able to 1CC at this level (upgrades notwithstanding). Even for those players, this will not be an easy game, and there is plenty of replay value for players of any expertise in aiming to top their high-score.Some may find the burst mode a little unusual. It's kind of like using bombs in most other games, but you don't need to use them so sparingly because your burst meter is constantly being refilled. Unlike bombs in, say, dodonpachi though, the burst does not make you invincible. It clears bullets in front of you, but you have to be careful to not fly sideways into them. This means that it's not a complete get-out-of-jail-free card, as you still have to avoid getting cornered or time it well so that you avoid any projectiles that the beam won't clear. For those who don't like the burst mode, there is also a classic mode, which has a concentrated beam and ship slowdown that many will be familiar with from cave games.Upgrades seem like an unnecessary addition. I would have preferred to see them added as in-game items, or just make the weapons more powerfull to begin with. A choice of ship type would have also been another good way of implementing different levels of spread/power. My guess is that this system was an attempt to stand out from the game's predecessors by avoiding being too much like dodonpachi and other similar games, but in my opinion this particular aspect wasn't the best choice.###Design - This is where my only real gripes are. Tate mode is not well implemented for those of us who have a portrait mode monitor permanently set up. It is implemented by going in to the options and rotating the view, but this can only work on a monitor that is set up in lanscape mode in Windows. Considering that most people who have a portrait monitor don't have it set as their primary display, the workflow goes:Set portrait monitor to primary display -> set to landscape -> tilt head sideways to be able to read things on the display -> launch game -> rotate view in options -> tilt head upright again -> zoom view in options until game fills the screen - > play game -> exit game -> set monitor back to portrait -> change primary displayBecause this is such a hassle, it means that I usually play on my primary monitor in landscape mode, but with the added problem that when I DO use tate mode, I have to change the rotation and zoom inside the game each time, both before and after playing. This could be made much simpler by enabling portrait resolutions natively.There are some other minor complaints about the design. The game doesn't remember your previous choices (apart from upgrades) and has no retry option. This means that when you die and want to retry, you have to exit the level to the main menu, and select mode, difficulty level, etc. all over again. A post on the forum by the developer suggests that a retry option will soon be added.###Overall - Despite some flaws in the design, this is one of the best bullet hell shooters out there; it's definitely my favourite non-cave one. I would quite happily give it 4/5 stars as is, but once the retry option is added, if native portrait resolutions were also added, I'd be hard pressed to find a reason not to give it 5/5."

Equally strange system by which the game gets easier the more you play it due to accumulation of pilot points you can use to upgrade your ship on subsequent runs.In spite of this, the main game is solid with a smooth difficulty curve, ample scoring options, and a clean 60fps HD post-rock aesthetic. Its traditional mechanics, sleek look, and moderate difficulty make it a great introduction to the genre, even if a lot of this stuff came right out of Perfect Cherry Blossom."

,Recommended,280560,11892456,"Posted: 27 August, 2014",all,Shotime,"Danmaku Unlimited 2 from Doragon Games is a Japanese-inspired bullet-hell shooter.I enjoyed my time with it; however, there are a few issues with it that preventing me from loving it.For one, the sprites are VERY large.  I believe the developer worked soley on iPhone games before this one and you can definitely tell.  I found it difficult to navigate around the playing field at times and felt claustrophobic on more than a few occasions.  This is a shame, because it's not how you should feel when you're playing a shmup - the bullet patterns should make you feel like you're threading the needle down a narrow canyon, not like you're trapped inside an elevator.  Adding to this complaint, the ship speed felt slow to me.  You couldn't zip around and avoid bullets if you needed to, and then slow down using a focus-fire mechanic, there seemed to be no change in speed of your ship when you switched to focus.I started playing the game on ""Normal"" difficulty and felt challenged.  This is a good thing - when I say challenged I mean to say it was really difficult.  There were two difficulty levels above ""Normal"" and I was pumped to check them out.  After beating the main game I jumped right into ""Extreme"" (hardest) difficulty expecting to get my socks blown off...unfortunately, that didn't happen.  Extreme was nearly the same difficulty as Normal was, just with a few added bullets here and there, but the patterns were largely the same, and if you had figured them out on Normal, adjusting to Extreme wasn't that much bigger of a deal.Upgrade mechanics - this I didn't like.  The game has an ""Upgrade"" mechanic in it.  Basically it seems you're supposed to grind the game out quite a bit before your ship is fighting at its full potential.  I think that's stupid.  There's no reason I should have to throw myself at enemies with an underleveled ship numerous times and die in the process before I can have all my unlocks earned.  That's not to say this mechanic *can't* work - it's just that DU2 doesn't fit this style of gameplay.  Example - one of my favorite shmups of all time is Tyrian, it has an upgrade mechanic and it works beautifully as you can upgrade in-between levels and there are numerous paths and levels you can go down.  DU2 is one path, five levels, and you're supposed to grind those same levels out for awhile until your ship's weapons are upgraded and you have all your lives and all your continues available.  No thanks, all or nothing please, this half-way attempt was detrimental to the player's experience.The music was good, although I did wish there was more of it.  Each level had a song and there was a ""boss"" song that repeated at every boss fight except for the final boss.  It was good and unique for a shmup - metal, sounded kind of like Animals as Leaders or Between the Buried and Me or something.There are two gameplay modes - Normal and Classic.  Normal is the developers take on a scoring system I guess, but I didn't really like it and stuck to classic mode.  The only difference that I really saw was that instead of a ""Focus Fire"" mode you had to charge up a beam cannon that lasted only a limited time as well.Overall I like what the developer was going for here but the above mistakes prevented the game from being a standout (especially the sprite-sizing and claustrophobic feeling).  That's not to say I wouldn't recommend it, I do, but I would only recommend it for fans of the genre.  There are better titles to play (especially for new players) and I would recommend starting there before grabbing DU2.With all that said, DU2 is a fine addition to a shmup fan's catalogue and I'm sure you'll have some fun going through the game a few times."

I used to play shooters on the C64 and Amiga and the last PC shooter I played was Raptor: Call of the Shadows.Recently, I wanted to get back into the shooter genre and specifically try the 'danmaku games' or 'bullet hell games'. Based on reviews, I chose to start with Danmaku Unlimited 2.Boy, did things change for the good over the years. This game has responsive control and very rewarding gameplay.  Difficulty is steep but the game is easy to get into and the game is never 'unfair'.Tech-support was top-notch. I had a weird problem with my video-card under Win8.1. Google came up empty.

,Recommended,280560,11092154,"Posted: 5 July, 2014",all,applebaps,"This game has a pretty polished graphical style to it, and the soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.  You usually don't hear music this good in a shmup.  It's easily my favorite OST at the moment.  I can't overemphasize how many points that's worth, in a genre centered around visceral appeal combined with a little brain overload.  The music is important, and DU2's music gets you pumped as heck.That said, I have mixed feelings about the actual shmuppery.  Don't get me wrong, I recommend it, because it's fun.  The scoring is simple to wrap your head around, the game itself is relatively straightforward and the patterns are nice, etc.  The bullets are chunky and bright and easy to read, in nice colors.  But the game uses a leveling system that ends up being pointless after you play for a few hours and hit max level.  It just becomes an extra screen to mash through after each playthrough.  And they don't give you enough points to max out more than one shot type, or to have more than one level in each if you want all of them.  So, why even have you level up?  Why not do different ship types?  The shield system also feels pretty noobish.All that said, though, the game is still a lot of fun to play, and the stages and bosses have some patterns that are really fun to dodge.  The game also gets ridiculously difficult on higher settings, so there's some longevity to it."

,Recommended,280560,10939817,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Capt_Blakhelm,"Buy? YES!-=TL;DR=-Danmaku Unlimited is an extremely well crafted vertical shooter that nails controls, difficulty, bullet patterns, graphics and sound design. While a bit difficult due to its bullet hell nature, the game is argurably (and often noted as) accessible to the non-danmaku player - the kind of person that would play shmups ocassionally, but generally not these types. The presentation of DU2 is of top-notch quality, most especially the soundtrack and sound design, and video options even include screen rotation, though, not my 2560x1080 resolution.  Danmaku Unlimited 2 is a pefect buy for shmup/danmaku fans, and a solid introdution for the non-fans, especially at a low price. I knew immediately within the first minute of gameplay that this game was excellent.-=Gameplay=First off, the options screen provides options to change prize drop visibility, trance mode (super attack) sound cues, screen rotation, most notably the ability to change from X-Input (Xbox 360) or D-Input (DirectInput, the standard of controllers before X-Input), as well as the sound/music options seen in most games (why the hell you'd turn that down is a matter of sin). I've read that the game doesn't support arcade sticks, which is insane, but I would think a X-Input or D-Input stick would work, at least with something like JoyToKeyMain game modes are Arcade and Bonus. Arcade makes the player ship move in a consisten speedt and provides a beam weapon that can cancel bullets and is refilled either by time orbs (I can't tell). The player has a choice of chosing a Focus (Straight) shot, a partial straight and homing shot, and a spread shot. Classic plays more like Exceed 3rd, where the ship moves quickly in its standard shot, and moves slowly to help you carefully dodge and shoots semi-homing bullets in a narrow line, which causes more damage. The Bonus mode offers a Boss Rush and a Free Play mode where you can choose to practice on any level. While most shmups's replayability comes from practice and and doing One Credit Clears (callled 1CC, beating a game w/o continues), the replayability comes in the form of a level up system, which gives you points to improve your weapon type, beam weapon (ADS), Burst attack, lives, and continues after winning or loosing the game. Points for levels are granted regardless if you win, so you are not at a complete disadvantage if you loose, though, most Shmup players will be fine with the standard weaponry.The hitbox is clear and quite forgiving as I've had the edge of bullets actually touch the box itself and the bullets are drawn, colored, animated, and used perfectly to give a player an idea of where the bullet is going and where you need to dodge. This is important, as grazing bullets on your sprite is handy in scoring multipliers and points. The bullets are flashy, but not distractedly so, and as long as you focus on the pattern and your location, you should do well. More bonuses are rewarded when you kill enemies with in the circle around your ship which is the point blank range, the same area points are absorbed into when the fall down the screen.Unless there is some missing/idle cutscene I skipped, there's no story here, and that's how I like it.-=Presentation=-I'm a sucker for cyberpunk/spacepunk/sci-fi-punk style games, so I automatically love the sharp vector look mixed with soft lighting effects. and bright, but non-offensive blue, pink, and green hues. The appearance may be rough for epilieptics, and maybe a little overwhelming if you not used to this genre, but I feel there is a certain crispness and color selection of the bullets that is just right. Though, the game doesn't reach my high native resolution, so the graphics look a bit off compared to what I think it should look like.The sound design is perfect. The instrumental techno-metal soundtrack is very similar to Exceed the 3rd: JPBP which is exactly the type of music needed to get you pumped and ready for the bullet chaos. It is exactly my style of music, and I bought the digital soundtrack of CDBaby (can be found on iTunes as well). There's not too much noise beyond explosisions of ships, some bullets/patterns, the perfectly low ""click"" from grazing bullets, the ""ping"" from collecting points and you don't have to deal with dialogue or annoying chatter - if you're not a fan of shmup dialogue or the Japanese schoolgirl chatter common to these games, you don't have to deal with it.-=Conclusion=-Everything about DU2 is solid and of great quality. The Steam reviews are 100% postive according to Enhanced Steam. The game is a must-buy for shmup/danmaku fans. I really want to see non-bullet hell fans give this game a shot on easy or normal difficulties - they need to feel how and why shmup fans like myself are so into these type of games."

,Recommended,280560,14279018,"Posted: 1 February, 2015",all,Graced by Autumn,"There’s something to be said about the doujin shmup scene, especially when it comes to accessibility and difficulty curves. Indeed, the sheer size of the challenge laid out before would-be bullet hell players often proves itself to be the greatest obstacle that separates those who develop a fondness for games of the genre and those who don’t. While the sub-genre has always possessed a high entry-barrier that no doubt contributed to its limited appeal outside of Japan in the past, those games that hail from the doujin variety tend to stand out in particular. With Danmaku Unlimited 2 Doragon Entertainment seeks to recreate that iconic doujin experience. For the most part, they succeed.If Danmaku Unlimited 2 has an in-depth story, it isn’t presented in the game. Like most shmups, Danmaku Unlimited 2 puts narrative to one side and gives its full, undivided attention to the gameplay experience alone. While each of the game’s five stages provides some degree of context for the action, it’s clearly the case that this isn’t a story-driven game.The driving force behind Danmaku Unlimited 2 stems from its well-polished, highly-refined core gameplay. A typical scenario begins with the player gunning down countless enemies as they appear at the top of the screen, all the while avoiding the beautiful but deadly hail of bullets sent the player’s way. Defeating enemies causes scoring items to appear and fall towards the bottom of the screen. The final phase of each level is indicated by a boss, who throws a series of different bullet patterns at the player in sequence, switching to the next pattern each time the player inflicts a certain amount of damage upon the boss. Dealing with such heavy densities of enemy fire can prove troublesome, but that’s where ‘Trance’ comes in. Destroying one’s opponents charges the Trance Gauge. When the gauge is full, Trance can be activated, converting bullets in the player’s immediate vicinity into scoring items and also enabling the player to unleash more powerful attacks than before.The enemy placement within each level has been well-thought through. Weaker enemies are often clumped together, prompting the player to mow them down in quick succession to boost their score, while stronger enemies like to hide at the top of the screen, peppering the player with bullets and forcing them to take evasive action. However the bullet count consistently remains quite low, particularly for a game seeking to emulate a doujin shmup. It isn’t made any more challenging by the fact that the bullets also tend to move rather slowly. Those two factors lead to the game feeling somewhat easier than what one might initially expect, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on one’s past experience with bullet hell games. Players who are no strangers to the conventions of the genre are more than likely to find themselves underwhelmed even on higher difficulties, which is a shame, considering that those are the people most likely to possess the strongest appreciation for the doujin shmup.Before setting off to battle; either from the start of the game or from any stage of the player’s choosing via ‘Free Play’; one may choose from one of two modes. ‘Burst Mode’ provides the player with a potent beam attack which can be used for going on the offensive, or for clearing a path through enemy bullets. The advantages afforded to the player by having such a tool at their disposal are offset by their inability to generate scoring items by killing enemies through the use of normal fire: accurate, efficient use of the beam attack and Trance become the only means of guaranteeing a high score. ‘Classic Mode’ offers up more a traditional bullet hell experience that those already acquainted with the genre should feel right at home with, in which attacks of any sort are adequate for creating scoring items.The beam attack and Trance are both well-conceived mechanics. They can double up as additional defensive measures for those getting to grips with the action, while also serving as means for securing additional points, for individuals already on top of things.Players operate the Senko fighter, a versatile craft capable of undergoing numerous upgrades to suit the situation as necessary. Playing the game in any mode earns the player experience. Accumulating experience will gradually allow the player to progress in rank until they hit the top and become an Ace. As rank increases so too do the player’s options to outfit the Senko with the capabilities of their choosing. Players can opt for three different forms of attack for their fighter, in addition to the beam attack. It’s possible to take multiple forms of attack for the sake of versatility, or to focus on upgrading one in order to support a specific playstyle. Those willing to forego the luxury of having extra lives and credits at their disposal will find themselves able to maximize their offensive capabilities. This upgrade system gives players a chance to experiment and find a playstyle that works for them, while also lending the game additional replayability. It’s a nice touch, and one that feels original but still has its place in a bullet hell game.Danmaku Unlimited 2 is a visually stunning 2D piece – the graphics are easily some of the best seen in a bullet hell game in recent times. The cyan/purple colour palette gives the game’s environments an ‘otherworldly’ look, but not one that feels too far-fetched. Ships have a bold, coloured outline that makes them stand out, even when the screen is literally filled with explosions and scoring items. The centralized HUD also makes a difference: it’s nice not having to take yours eyes too far from the action to glance at some game-critical info. A cyan-coloured dot marks the player ship’s hitbox, which still remains easy to spot in the midst of a heated battle, thanks to the trail it gives off. Unfortunately the same can’t be said about the game’s audio. Most; if not all; of the music quickly gets repetitive. The sound effects themselves are surprisingly weak, and don’t have any real impact, with some explosions being barely even audible even at higher volume levels.Overall Danmaku Unlimited 2 is a fairly enjoyable game that’s likely to find the most favour with those caught in the middle-ground. Long-time veterans of the genre might find the experience a little too light, but for the uninitiated and anyone with only a moderate degree of bullet hell experience, Doragon Entertainment’s love letter to fans of the doujin shmup delivers an entertaining package that; generally speaking; knows and understands at least part of its audience."

In certain sections, particularly after level 2, it is nearly impossible to NOT take a hit - and bosses are guaranteed to deplete your lives in a hurry (try to get to the boss in Wilde Sau with as many lives as possible - you're going to need them!) In spite of this, however, the game never seems unfair or cheaty - if you die in Danmaku 2, it's your fault. And as noted, you WILL die. Plenty of times.Part of this is because the game rewards the player for being adventurous. Grazed bullets earn you points, and can help replenish the Trance meter faster. This, in turn, goads the player into becoming reckless and 'showing off' - which leads to warranted and inevitable death. Again, however, at no point does this mechanic seem unfair; it is simply a trick meant to boost the difficulty, and it's the player's own fault for falling for it.This review could not end without mention being made of the music. While the sound effects are minimal, and nothing you would not expect from a game of this type, this is by no means a downside, as more space is given to the GORGEOUS musical score. Each level is scored by crisply-played, adrenaline-pumping instrumental thrash metal, which perfectly complements the game's ultra-violent, yet stunningly refined atmosphere. It is the kind of music which makes you regret that the soundtrack is not available, and takes you to Bandcamp to see if BLANKFIELD have a page on there.All in all, then, Danmaku Unlimited 2 comes across as a winner all round. Stunning visuals, smooth controls, hard but fair difficulty, and a fantastic soundtrack all contribute to create a superb retro blast, which would have been a steal at full price, let alone on sale!

Even though its asking price is quite modest and it's a bit on the short side this is a very much complete game with a pumping soundtrack full of hype that goes perfectly with the gameplay. There are some different modes to change things up. All in all it's well worth it, if you ask me."

If you like Cave,  Touhou, buy this now.Good-You are a spaceship that shoots stuff, and there are other spaceships shooting at you-No waifu animu stuff-Two game modes that are different enough to warrant mentioning-Soundtrack by Animals as Leaders-Manageable bullet patterns that can be learned and practiced-Development team of one dude in Canada-$5Bad-Score system not explained well-No way to tell which ships will hurt you when touching"

The enemies just feel helpless as they send all of their soldiers and ships to be destroyed and killed. It almost makes me feel unstopable. Music, stage, bosses and ship design is good. I kinda wish this game had a 2 player mode with support for local play (playing together on the same PC via keyboard, so both fighters are controlled by the same keyboard), and enough pilot levels so you can max out all your stats. But other than that, this game is great, I also wish that the shmup and/or danmaku genre was more popular."

It might not be the prettiest one and has some rough edges here and there, but it has some really nice stuff going on - good ideas well executed and a lot of nice bullet patterns to dodge. Nice boss battles and a nice soundtrack also. Well worth the price.The only gripes I have with this game is the rather poor controller support and the fact it doesn't close properly on my computer (Win 7). But really, support this dev. I at least want to see more from Doragon in the future!"

It's interesting that the game gives you an additional 'continue' as an award for playing it each time. This game is not nearly as pretty as it could be but it runs fast and has no bugs that i've seen. It's challenging but, if played casually, not frustrating. Just a nice little diversion. The music is crummy and so is the sound but the gameplay is frenetic, repetitive but fun. A fun little nostalgic game and can be gotten for relatively cheap during special Steam sales."

High resolution, 60 frames per second smoothness all the time, controls are precise, score multipliers, and the soundtrack is AMAZING metal that suits the game perfectly. I actually want to get better computer speakers so I can play it LOUDER. This game really has it all. Full 360 controller support. If you like bullet hell, BUY NOW."

76561198037157856,Recommended,280560,35232392,Posted: 26 September,all,trottier.wong,"This game is a whole lot of fun. I mean, the truth is, this is a shmup. You either like them or you hate them. Personally, I like them, though I acknowledge not all of them are great. Danmaku Unlimited 2 (DU2) does nothing crazy innovative. On the other hand, it takes the common shmup formula and really zeros in on what makes it good.GameplayIn the realm of shmups, this is what you call a ""bullet hell"" game. That recognizing patterns, dodging bullets, and rarely staying still. To give this game more dimensions, there's a system where you need to build up to use your stronger offensive modes. If you time things just right, you can chain together the different modes for rampant destruction. Also, you can earn credits, which allow you to buy more abilities, which allows you to progress further in the game.GraphicsWhile this game has a retro feel, it's by no means a retro-style game. It uses polygons that are pretty basic, which is understandable since Danmaku 2 started life as a mobile game. For a game like this, it doesn't need to look like Crysis. After all, you're operating on a 2D plane blasting away at enemies. One soft criticism I have is that I wish this game ran in portrait mode, which would make it more immersive, and more akin to a proper arcade experience.SoundThis is the high point of DU2  for me because it's got a killer soundtrack. It's filled with techno and heavy metal instrumentals. When the double kick bass drum starts, you get pumped for the action. The sound effects are likewise gorgeous, and they really augment the experience.ControlDU2 runs smoothly on both keyboard and controller. On keyboard, you're using Z, X, C, and the arrow keys. I'm quite thankful that they don't force mouse control or lots of button mashing. I likewise tested this game on both an Xbox 360 and a Steam controller, and they both worked well. This is the kind of game were you need precision controlling, so make sure you're using something fairly comfortable and durable.Hardware CompatibilitySeeing how this started out as an iOS game, it's disappointing that this isn't at least compatible with Macs. This quibble aside, Danmaku runs on virtually any modern Windows hardware. I tested it on an i7 tower with a GTX 1050 Ti (2017), an HP Stream 11 (2014), a Lenovo ThinkPad E31 (2011), and an Intel Compute Stick (2016). It all runs fine and smoothly on all those computers.OverallIf you're looking for a bullet hell shmup that puts you in the zone and has a killer soundtrack, then DU2 is for you. It's fun and energetic, and has lots of challenge. That said, I wish this was a more robust PC port because portrait mode would be nice.Score: 3.5/5"
