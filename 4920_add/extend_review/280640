,Not Recommended,280640,9424362,"Posted: 11 March, 2014",all,<><><><>,"I went into this with very low expectations. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but here goes.This is the WORST video game I've ever played.THE WORST.Now, why am I complaining so much? Let me start with the technical issues. 1. I was greeted with a resolution setting that only goes up to 1680 x 1050. Not even 1080. That♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. 2. The graphics. This looks like Half-Life 1, and for a game that is awfully new, it should looks somewhat okay, but it doesn't. This game tries to shove in your face that it has bloom and SSAO in it, but seriously, even with them, the game still looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3. Voice Acting. Dreadful. 4. Highest mouse sensitivity is still really slow for a person like me who likes to have a high mouse sensitivity.Alright, the story. Nothing special. And by that I mean pretty much non-existent. You and a bunch of ""teammates"" go to the castle, after it has been attacked. Turns out the girl of your dreams has been taken. Now you have to get her back. And there you go. I'm not gonna complain about the small amount of story I've been given, because honestly, I just want to try the hack and slash.The first level. Why they made it so complicated did not make any sense to me. The first level started off with a mother♥♥♥♥ing keyhunt. It made no sense.    It confused the living hell out of me. I needed to use a walkthrough, on the FIRST LEVEL. That's just awful. The area was big and the objects were all over the place. The controls were poor and didn't really help this game out at the slightest. Everything about this game just screamed wrong. For everyone asking about the keyhunt, imagine trying to find keys that do not even show up. That's right, you can't actually see them. Not to mention, you need a torch to even find one of them, which is just silly, because if there's a key there, then I wouldn't need a torch to actually see the key. It's a pointless quest to go find keys to open chests with other keys. But have I mentioned the fact that you literally have to walk on the walls to get an item you need? Yes, you do. You walk on the walls. YES. You literally jump on a small side railing on the wall, basically hovering to the side of it when you walk on it. I'm sorry, but I would never be able to figure that out because in a video game, I've never had to do that to actually get something. I just found that bizarre.Then the main section of the game. The fighting. Oh my.OH MY. OHH.You get three attacks. All of which are♥♥♥♥♥♥and don't feel natural. Combat was godawful. All you do is stab the enemy, move back, then just keep doing that until it's dead. That's it. That's the game. Oh my god. The attacks are all mapped to mouse buttons, including the middle mouse. I went immediately to change it, but WAIT, you can't change the controls. But for some reason, they have options for Bloom and SSAO instead of options for controls. Come on. Congratulations, you have shader effects. Yay.This is the worst. Day One, Walking Dead Survival Instinct, and Postal 3, are all better than this. I didn't want to say this, but I had to. I'm here for you so you can save money. I would not wish this on my worst enemies. My point has been made. Nothing in this game works properly. Everything is bad.0/10. This is a technical nightmare. Even if this game looks fun to you (which it really shouldn't), remember that it is 10 bucks, and you can do so much more with the ten bucks. I'm genuinely upset that I spent nine dollars on this."

But, thats as far as I could play this game. Its.. really, really bad. I felt like I was playing a FPS from the late 90's. Graphics are substandard, sound is reptitive and quite low quality, and the cutscenes are quite laughable. They are literally 2 characters standing there, with the camera rotating around, and occasionally focusing on.. well.. a dark field? I wasnt sure, as there was little to no detail.Now Ive bought plenty of games in early access, and if this was an Alpha, with additional graphical upgrades, sound, etc to come, then I wouldnt be too critical of it. But.. this is it. There is snow falling inside of rooms. Fog in closed off hall ways. Bricked up rooms. Stairs that are so steep that you have to hop up when you get to the top step. The punch animation looks like a piece of paper with chain mail on it.The final straw for me was when I entered the dining room, to obtain the oil needed to light my torch. It was on top of a cabinet. A cabinet I could only climb by backtracking in the room, climbing a oveturned table, climbing half way up the wall, and then walking over to hop on top.Is this what the waitress would have done had I asked for some oil for my green salad?"

I didnt even want to play beyond the point when I got the first weapon. Its not worth 10 dollars or even a dollar. Please just avoid it it stinks."

First off you have to sit through 8 minutes of the credits EVERY time you start the game, no jumping right to the menu. The graphics are REALLY bad, like something a game design student might produce as a freshman. voice acting is pure amateur, the characters lips don' t even move. Mouse sensitivity is low, its like you are drunk or your connection is laggy. Controls are not customizable WASD to move and thats it. This alone is a deal killer for the Munkey.Go ahead and buy it, see for yourself what an awful, horrible peice of crap this is."
,Not Recommended,280640,9985528,"Posted: 30 April, 2014",all,Bayta,"There isn't a whole lot more that can be said about this game that hasn't already been said. It's bad. Not even fun bad, just plain old regular BAD. But let's go over it, shall we?First, the graphics. Everyone knows this. Take one look at the screenshots, it's not too difficult to tell how utterly atrocious they are. The game's description on Steam says that the game has an old-school look to it, (or something like that, I can't be bothered to look up the exact quote) but old-school doesn't even begin to describe it. Castlevania is old-school. Zelda 64 is old-school. Doom is old-school. This game's graphics, on the other hand, just look like they were♥♥♥♥♥♥out by the leftovers from Morrowind, which in my admitedly unpopular opinion, has not aged well at all.Second, let's talk about the controls. You can't keybind anything. You can make some adjustments to mouse sensitivity, and invert the mouse's Y axis, but that's it. Don't like the layout? Well, ♥♥♥♥ you. Your character's movement, too, is just weird in general. Movement is very sluggish. Everything seems a bit zoomed in, but if you zoom out, it still just feels nauseating. Combat, if you've got the patience to even get to it (I'll get back to that), is painfully bare. There's no strategy involved whatsoever. Hit your enemy, pull back, then go back in for another hit. Rinse and repeat.Third, let's talk about the story. What's the story? A bunch of monsters and/or people in scary get-up have been ravaging the land, and got into the castle. They killed all the guards, and took all the money, taxes (yes, taxes), and swords. Also, they took this guy's sister, and you better save her, because you're in love with her. The only image we see of said woman is awkwardly animated, with flailing arms and a grand total of one facial expression. Now normally I wouldn't complain too much about the damsel in distress trope, overused though it may be, but the way this game goes about it is just stupid, to the point where I had to stop after the cutscene to finish laughing. Basic isn't even the word, bad is closer to what I'm looking for.Okay, now here's the big one. How would you expect a fantasy hack and slash video game to open? A tutorial level? Sure. What's in the tutorial level? A few low-level baddies for you to kill, with a few different weapons to try out? Nah, that'd just be asinine. Instead, let's have the tutorial level be a stupidly complex find the key quest, in an overly large castle? Yup, that sounds good to me. Yeah, no litterally, the FIRST instructions you are given in the game are to find a bunch of keys so you can get a sword. But it's not like you just find one key and get your reward. A key opens a door, which opens a chest, which gives you some unnecessary item, which lets you get another key, which THEN lets you get the sword. And all of it is separated between different rooms in this quite large castle.All this makes the game seem REALLY bad. It is. But the worst thing about this game, I repeat, the WORST thing about this game is nothing I have mentioned thus far. What♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off most about this game is that Barnabas Collins didn't even get a single appearance. Or Quentin, or Angelique. 0/10 Worst Game Ever.No, but really, what's with the title, guys? It's not some super obscure thing, Dark Shadows was pretty dang popular back in its day. And okay, even if you didn't know about the show, how could you completely avoid the recent shipwreck of a remake Tim Burton♥♥♥♥♥♥out a couple years ago? That's a lawsuit waiting to happen there."

But the game is NOT responsive or very slow in response to controls, if there are any. I can hardly find any key to manipulate anything and the F1 and F2 keys are absolutely not helping much.What is even more, the entire game lacks ANY pleasure a gamer needs of this kind of game: almost NO loot, disappointing endings in which you suddenly get killed by an invisible enemy and an impossible quest at start: find a sword and some keys. After 1 hour of gameplay, I have been killed 5 times and only found 1 key, unable to defend myself and with a feeling of... disappointment.PLEASE TAKE THIS GAME OFF YOUR LIST.It isn't even worth giving it for free.........."

They shouldn't.Game looks dreadful, level design is all over the place and does not make much sense.When you turn your viewpoint around the whole skybox and the moon starts to spinn in a weird fashion.Also your character gets stuck on everything mostly on stairs that you supposed to use.So what I did in the game? I was trying to ""glitch"" up to this damn oil bottle for at least 15 minutes, after that I run aimlessly only to find lots of locked doors. At the end I got myself a weird torch thing and my character geometry broke.Not really new Dark Souls. Not at all.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=521214422"

,Not Recommended,280640,23253759,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,that's what she said,"In all honesty I expected pretty bad game. But it surpassed all my expectations. The game is a crime against humanity. Even making such things should be punishable by law. One just can't possibly comprehend it's grandeur - this thing is a mental torture. I think we are stretching the definition of a game with this one. It's a great luck if the thing won't launch on you, but I worked hard to get into it and now I wish I wasn't. I must admit - the game is unintentionally creepy. Like that weird youtube corner you suddenly end up late at night.See, reviews state it pretty clear that the game is so awful it might kill your hamster. But they don't state clearly why.Now I actually started to understand. You can't pick a single bad quality of a game, because EVERYTHING is awful. Controls, visuals, performance, audio, gameplay, story, cinematics, loading times, menus, every damn thing in this game is broken BY DESIGN. And all these parts are dancing in macabre waltz in front of your eyes. Well, at least there isn't any significant bugs because it's all broken by design and it's unfixable by any level of polish.Judging by performance/visuals and require to disable Data Execution Prevention alone it might even summon Satan in your basement, so clear your browser history while you can.You just couldn't imagine it until you see it. And then you couldn't explain what you saw and felt and you just go post gibberish on steam reviews when repulsion builds up enough for venting.You'll feel dirty after 10 minutes with this one. But you can't wash it away. I tried. You've been warned."

All of my friends games got blown out of the water, the window, the world, and the universe.Okay, so the game-play......oh boy, where do i start?You think the first 5 minutes of skyrim is boring? oh god, most of my hours was completing the first damn level. I couldn't find the required items without using a guide, and even using the guide was difficult. It took me 30 Minutes to find the sword (what you require) using a guide. The map is so large for finding one damn thing, and the rest of the last level? you guessed, finding keys to unlock doors to give you more keys. There is really only one good part of the game, the buggy mechanics. I BHOPed all over the castle and killed myself laughing from the mechanics more then what i did do the finding. Also, there are dead civilians, not scary at least since there is one death face, even for females. and that death face is a males face.""Lord gaben, next time, could you please recommend me a better game then this 0.5% completed game?

If the creators had taken the time to do something risky and creative they could have accomplished a lot, even with this limited technology. This feels like the first try college project that never got polished after it was turned in to the professor. Definitely not worth any more than 2 dollars. Everyone should play this game just to understand why you shouldn't give super open ended unintuitive content to people followed by constant repetative fighting."
