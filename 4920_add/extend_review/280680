,Recommended,280680,9710225,"Posted: 2 April, 2014",all,Bewts,"This is a great digital painting software that has a lot to offer. Included is everything you would need to get personal or even professional work done. You can flip and rotate the canvas like in SAI, there are perspective tools to guide scene creation, a plethora of usefull brushes (speedpaint sketch being my favorite), not to mention all the filters and photo manipulation that you would find in photoshop. I love that I can resize the canvas without interfiering with the drawing. I love that every brush can be used as an eraser with just a toggle key. It's as fast and light as SAI with all the functionality of bulky photoshop.I would love to see a more focused direction though. Having all this functionality can sometimes get in the way of whats important in a program like this. Getting straight into the work with clear intuitive controls and minimizing any bumps that get in the way and allowing the user to get a hold of the full functionality with little effort. I find that less clutter and more user control via hotkeys and slidders the better. This is aimed at visual people after all. I would also like them to take advantage of modifier keys.Thankfully they are adding the ability to switch between brushes with hotkeys. No information on when that will be, but it's this kind of functionality that speeds up the painting process. Less time fiddling around in tool windows and more time spent with your eyes on the canvas.The dev's have been very attentive during the entire early access process of this software. I've personally provided lots of feedback that I've already seen results from. A big thumbs up to this dev team and the fact that they do care about the user and want to shape Krita around our needs. Gemini already came in with a good foundation of standard features that you expect to see in a digital painting software. So theres a lot to build on for them going forward now. It still needs a lot of work and I hope people will continue to provide usefull feedback. Krita Gemini has really benifited from the early access."

So I'm going to list the Pros and Cons of the software as well as a tl;dr at the bottom.Pros:The wrap-around feature which is surprisingly well implemented and easy to useThe brushes are well done and almost any brush you'd need for a drawing or painting is already implementedIf a brush you need is not implemented you can tweak every brush to your hearts content and save it as a presetThe perspective grid is easily created and edited to create near perfect perspective drawingsPhotoshop-like layers which will make any photoshop user feel right at homeExcellent developer response (Read below if you want more information)Don't have enough money to buy Krita Gemini? Go to their site and get the free Krita Desktop, same software almost except no Steam support and a few features aren't there but other than that the same thing but free. (But buy Krita Gemini as soon as you have enough money)Cons:Unable to animate within applicationSmall images sometimes don't work (For example 128x128 px)Too many pros, not enough cons.Developer Response:I'm the only person having the problem in the cons list and they responded and talked to me one on one on steam in order to understand the problem so they can try and fix it ASAP. It's like everyone is having the problem and they want to fix it quickly. GREAT developer response and I think better than what I've ever seen in my entire life. Sure it took a few days for them to actually see my review but I'd rather wait a few days and get this kind of customer service than wait a few days and they do nothing or not even get a response in general.Edit:Figured out how to use pen pressure, I guess my tablet was just screwing up so NOT THE PROGRAMS FAULT. With pen pressure lines are AMAZINGLY smooth and I'm beginning to like this program more than Photoshop as it's MUCH cheaper and just runs better in general.Tldr; Excellent customer service, excellent tools, and professional brushes make this an EXCELLENT buy."

,Recommended,280680,10149643,"Posted: 17 May, 2014",all,Frenden,"Great app, but the new symmetry tool indicator is a step backwards.I've been using Krita on Linux for a while and was glad to see it getting released on Steam. Recent updates have greatly improved stability and speed.The only design decision of their recentmost efforts that I see as a step backwards is the very large, opaque symmetry tool indicator that divides your canvas when mirroring is turned on. It doesn't rotate when you use arbitrary canvas rotation while drawing and is generally too large and in the way,Other apps such as Sketchbook and Manga Studio either have very minimal indicators for symmetry or the option to turn them to a low opacity. I find the new implementation too distracting and have stopped using it as a result. Adding a toggle for the symmetry/mirror tool's new indicator line would be great.Great work, team. The new improvements are great!"
,Recommended,280680,10351980,"Posted: 4 June, 2014",all,KITE [Wildin'],"This program is incredible, arguably the best digital painting program I've ever used: I can hardly believe that it's still in beta. It surpasses PhotoShop, GIMP, ArtRage, and even SAI in terms of brush availability and versatility (you can edit the brushes however you want and save them as a preset). It doesn't consume much memory compared to other painting programs, nor does it make my Wacom tablet lag when used - it's incredibly tablet-friendly because it was designed with them in mind.With lifetime upgrades and early access for $25, it's a steal. I have no doubt that this program will only get better as it is developed further."

,Not Recommended,280680,30842490,Posted: 30 March,all,Shadowpint,"I like Krita a lot but can't recommend this paid version. It's behind the free version, and also a lot less stable at least for me. (Gemini had a noticeable amount of crashing for me while Desktop does not) The version of Desktop you can access with Gemini as one of it's betas is behind, too. Currently on Krita's website you can download version 3.1.2. Gemini's version of Desktop is at 3.0, so it's not good for having an auto-updating Krita Desktop either. One thing this version has over Desktop is that alternate interface, but I found that interface to be inferior to the normal one. I can't switch to it either because for some reason Krita in particular is giving a disk write error when it tries to update. I've used it for longer than Steam says as you can start it without Steam which I tend to do."

,Not Recommended,280680,30734035,Posted: 25 March,all,Psyshy,Just get the free version this one is out of date.Seriouslly I love krita but wtf happened to lifetime upgrades!? why did I pay money for this if its going to be left in the dust?the free version is up to 3.1.2 but in gemini you have to OPT INTO A BETA just to run the 3.0 version and there is no way at all to run any more recent build.This had so much potential if they had just kept it up to date and maybe added workshop support for brush presets or something id give it a solid recommendation at any price but as it is now you are better off downloading the open source version and just donating 10 bucks while you are at it.
,Recommended,280680,12867865,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,トランズ げんじ,"So, I'll start with review off with saying I actually stopped using this product. I prefer a different free application. Though, this is a really great product for the right kind of artist. Skip to the bottom for a TL;DR.One thing that is nearly inexcusable is that when you switch brushes it resets your brush settings, and the slider you use to change the size jumps. So you might go from 5.55 to 15.55 and getting anything inbetween is rather difficult.I can not stress enough though how big of an issue that setting reset is for me though. I would say it is the main reason I stopped using this software.Now, the brush selection is incredible. I found a few that were similar to what I'm used to and a plethora of ones I could learn to master. A helpful hint is right clicking the brush will let you set a category for it to go to. So you can make a 'Favorite' category and not have to go through their freaking 70 brushes every time. The layers were a bit of a learning curve but I eventually understood it.This game is a freaking *chore* to launch though, Steam does it's usual pre launch updates and then the actual program goes. And that has a window to launch to pick the page size and then another window for the actual art program.And I want to warn people with older computers you might have severe lagging issues. My laptop is about 3-4 years old and this is the one art program out of all the ones I have tried (SAI, Photoshop, GIMP, and FireAlpaca) where I have actually had to stop drawing because there was so much lag my lines came out like puke.TL;DR:> I woud NOT suggest this program if you do simple line art and flat or CG coloring. It is a very solid program but you're better off with something free like FireAlpaca. This has too much you won't really be using. I would not suggest it if you have an older computer either. I would not suggest this as your first painting program. Get something simplier if you're just getting into digital art.> I would DEFINITELY suggest this if you do complex digital painting. This is where you will really get the bang for your buck and where I would feel like none of the money for this program would be wasted. I would also suggest it if your computer is rather new, to avoid the lagging issues I had."
,Recommended,280680,17701823,"Posted: 24 August, 2015",all,James Griffin,"Overall great program. Lots of little things like wrap around mode mirror mode as well as being compatible with most formats from other programs make Krita a good choice. The brush engine is also great. This is the best choice if you are making tilesets for 2d games as wrap around mode lets you instantly see if it will tile without having to worry about using offset too, which it naturally does as well. Krita is also pretty easy to use, with no major setup needed like GIMP does, so it is great for beginners. Lastly Sketch is not overly useful but it’s fun for just messing around, with a little more functionality it could become a great little addition for just doing quick and dirty sketches when you want a simpler interface.There are some minor issues that can be annoying though. The program is a touch unstable at times, but every update makes it more stable. Over the last year though the devs have resolved the majority of the issues, while greatly expanding the program. I do recommend the development version as it is better in every way at this time.Edit: There were some issues with some Huion tablets, mine was resolved after I updated my Tablet drivers."

So the GUI in this program is beautifulAnd for a free program (unless you buy the premium steam version) it has the best brushes I've ever used.  A major con the kept me from using this program in the past was just how slow it was, but with all these fixes that I've managed, and a decent computer, this is an amazing program to have, naitive to my favorite version of Linux, which is KDE.  This will most likely be my primary drawing tool to have.

That being said tho it has some really nice tools and the brushes on offer are very nice indeed. Not practical for myself tho being a professional artist my work has to have a certain polish to it that sadly this software can not seem to achive. But for someone that wants something to toy around with for there own fun and enjoyment i say its very much worth the cost just dont expect anything to amazing. Also im not sure if its just me but after a while it all seemed to begin to lag a bit. And im using a 64 bit quad core with 16 gig of ram so thats something i feel shouldnt happen. But who knows it might get patched or perhaps there is something on my end. So final verdict is yes its nice and very fun to use it just dosent measure up to the standards of something i can use for work but im not sorry i bought it and i think neither will you be.

(but they're working actively on it right now)If you think Krita Gemini is too expensive right now (really, it's not) just remember that it can easily match, and at some points even surpass, pieces of software that have 4 digits in their price tag. There are a few things that still need work (the program could be optimized a bit better to improve performance, more advanced transform tools and/or other image editing options, etc.) but I'm confident that with devs as devoted as these, everything will work out just great. The brushes are awesome, the shortcuts make sense, the UI is very customizable and it's just a lot of fun to use. I can't wait to see what Krita still has in store for us."

Please keep in mind, however, I am totally new to digital artwork, programs and apps. I discovered Krita while doing a search for apps/programs that are touch screen friendly. I downloaded Krita Desktop, knowing that I would indeed need Gemini for my intentions. In fact, I stopped playing with desktop because I didn't want to  ""not like"" Gemini for the differences. (I read all of the user reviews.) Be aware, you can not just ""purchase Gemini,"" download & wala! You have to sign up/create a Steam account, verify said account, then log in and find your purchase. There is an option to let Steam install it for you when you initially purchase, but not being familiar, I bypassed that option. I left this page then returned. There (on this page) it said that Gemini is in my Library, but for the life of me, without that link, I couldn't find another about ""my library."" I wanted to let anyone else like me, who is new to Steam beacause of this purchase, know that it's doable!

I mean, the other steam option that I've found, Black Ink, has some weird fun options. But this is pretty practical stuff.Why then, is this thing so GOSH DANG LAGGY? I've never even heard of an art program with lag! You're just drawing lines! It makes an otherwise great application miserable, since after you draw enough lines, you either have to save and reboot it, or just imagine what your lines will probably look like a second down the road and go from there. Plus, for some reason, only some times when you draw a small shape, a menu pops up, and you have to cancel out of it and redraw your line.I'd reccomend Fire Alpaca instead.

Super powerful, light, just superb. I bought this version because I wanted to make use of the more touch friendly UI, but I've unfortunately run into a pretty big issue; Krita doesn't drawn on the canvas where the pen is touching the screen.It's like the input is being scaled down, roughly factor 2, so it draws halfway between where the pen is and the top left corner of the screen. The UI, however, is working perfectly fine with the pen. Drawing on the canvas with my finger or mouse works fine. It's only an issue on the canvas with the pen. It's a real shame because it effectively renders the programs highly unusable.This is on a Surface Pro 4 with Wintab installed.

Everything I said just changed with 3.0 which just came out...The 3.0 UI - user interface - communicates much better after whatever simple tweaks the programmers did.  Much better.The 3.0 performance actually performs on Windows well, unlike the 2.x versions that were kind of like an anvil tied to their leg while their linux counterparts were flying by in their 3rd Generation Pontiac Grand Ams.Animation Frame imports and Macro love.  PD Howler owns AF imports, while OpenCanvas owns the Actions recording because of their portalgraphics forum.That is, these are the areas, the UI, performance on Windows, and the animation frame editing that I saw the most need from the 2.x series.  And they worked on all of them.  Are you kidding?  The greatest need I see now is a worldwide forumshowing the process of artwork like OpenCanvas.  If they do that, and do it right, Krita will be a heavyweight on Steam.  (I have no expectations though.  Everyone will have different priorities.  From the standpoint of growing the community and making Krita more popular, this forum idea would be the best investment of time they could make.  Most especially with the recent loss of didlr, the Krita team could not ask for better timing.)The only thing that is less than stellar is their lack of package options for Linux.

SAVE ALWAYS, and TWEAK THOSE SETTINGS if the program gives you hassle.I also found switching to the other builds in the ""Beta"" tab in settings through steam helped improve performance, but depending on whether I used my laptop or desktop, I had to use different builds. So bare in mind it's a little random.Aside from all the bugs, my experience of it working has been fantastic and it has served me well in those times.There are some great tools at hand and a nice interface, along with a brush editor packed with options.If you're looking for a cheap gateway to the wonderful world of digital art, I'd take this but make sure you test it well within your first hour of use so you can return it if it's too buggy to use..I was gonna rate this up because it's still early in development and bugs / poor optimization is natural, but since us buyers are restricted to version 3.0 and 2 or 3 beta builds which are for some ALL unusable- It's a no vote for me :/Maybe start restricting users access to future builds once you've got a stable program, but not before man..
