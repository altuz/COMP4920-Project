,Recommended,280720,15705615,"Posted: 5 May, 2015",all,jsauce,"I purchased this game some time ago and have waited a long time to review it, due in part to some issues I had with it, but also because I wanted to be fair, considering that it is an early access game. So with that being said, my review:So I was flipping through the steam games and I came across this game called ""Imagine Earth"" in the simulation section, I saw that it had a demo and decided to try it. At the time the demo only had a missions available, a simple interface and not a lot in the way of content... but I was hooked.It reminded me why I like simulation games in the first place, giving me all the things I enjoy with the bonus of playing God to a newly created world to work with. I could feel the nostalgia of Sim Earth I played as a kid. So I jumped right in after playing the demo and purchased early access to the game.Playing the early access version it was immediately apparent the game was slightly different than the demo that been made available, which is okay considering that demos are just that, demonstrations of what the game will look like. But one thing was clear, this was no simulation game.What I got instead was a game that seemed more like a puzzle where your decisions didn't really matter more than getting the right pieces in the right order before you run out of time. I had many issues with the game, all of which I made clear by submitting emails to the developers who were very receptive and seemed opened to the community ideas.Lorian the third world in the game gave me excruciating torment, where it seemed the developers were more interested in creating a game of torture than a game of fun, and it became discouraging to play over and over, failure after failure. So I took a break, quit playing altogether in the hopes some of the issues I had with it would be solved eventually.So after months I decided to try the game again, and I am so glad that I did. All of the issues that I had originally had have disappeared. What was once an overly complicated puzzle of torture, had become a relaxing simulation/strategy game that was less scripted with super hard puzzle nonsense and although still difficult seems less locked into ""their"" pre-defined way to win strategy I sometimes felt when playing. Even when I failed a couple of times, I saw different ways to get to where I wanted and ultimately finished the things that were once overly difficult to beat.The developers have clearly taken the community recommendations and made the game a lot more playable and fun, and that's why I felt like it was time to review this game for them.I wholeheartedly recommend this game now, for its addictive playstyle that will keep you happy for hours on end. While the game is still unfinished, it’s very much where it needs to be now, and playing it no longer feels like an exercise in futility but rather an actual game that is fun to play. I'm excited to see more and cannot wait to see how this one ends.For the people that like extra-long drawn out games, this one might not be for you, as the game only has a few missions, but it almost doesn't matter because the addictive nature of it will keep you coming back for more. I hope to see expansions or additions to the game after it is released because what they have here opens so many other possibilities. Certainly you will be left wanting for more, and there doesn't seem to be any reason why the devs couldn't keep adding on to the game.For the people that love simulation, strategy, space games, this game is FOR YOU! For everyone else that loves fun quirky games, you'll want to play this game too. Beautiful, charming, and challenging. Highly recommended!"

Or need a side-task often to do with population in order to get new research points? It may sound like nitpicking but the oddity of the game's reasoning is sticking out like a thorn.Price: I still find it a bit pricey for what the game offers.The Verdict: ★★★☆☆A good little game, with a little more promised for the future. It's playable and enjoyable at this stage."
,Recommended,280720,18699359,"Posted: 26 October, 2015",all,GrandMaster-D,"Imagine Earth or: The game ""Reus"" wants to beImagine Earthis best described as a mixture of puzzle, strategy and management simulation. Even though with a educational mandate, as it's main feature is the fragility of planets. As the title implies this game throws a shadow on the future of our earth. But first things first.What is:In this game you are the jr. vice president of Imagine Earth, Ltd., a coorporation that colonizes distant planets for big profits. The game comes with a nice campaign, introducing you to likeable characters that guide you through your first steps. Expect to fail in the second mission anyways. Even though the tutorial is very well designed and gives a good guidance, the game itself remains a challenge.You start of every new colony by placing your first town centre on the planet. Soon enough new colonists will move in and develop a demand for food, energy and goods.By the games triangular grid, every building has - yes, that's right - three sides. And as you place buildings next to each other they possibly gain benefits or detriments from each other. So in this way Imagine Earth actually resembles ""Reus"". For example, you can increase the energy output of biomass plants by placing them next to forests or farms. But your inhabitants will become unhappy if you build coal plants next to their houses. Since building space is limited, conflicts are inevitable and part of the challenge arises from the task to place your buildings in the most productive and proficient way.What's else:On the other hand there are different types or tiles of terrain. So you want to place your farms on fertile land or your gas plants on top of gas resources to maximize outcomes. This task gets significant harder by the fact that all your buildings create pollution, eventually triggering a greenhouse effect on your planet. Fertile land turns into desert, tornados and volcanoes arise and ultimatly your facing meltdown of the polar caps, rising global water level. To cut a long story short,if you don't take care of your planet, it will want to get rid of you.[/b]]The graphics[/b] are a bit toony, which I personally enjoy very much. The planets themself looking like beautiful blue marbles that I - personally - feel a bit sad for, if my false management destroys them.The Musicitself is not extraordinarily remarkable but fits the pace of the game very good. (The speed of the music actually changes with the set game speed - mindblown!)The storyis also not quite thrilling but gives enough motivation to play through the campaign which I perceived mostly as a tutorial introducing my to new elements. Once your done with the rather short campaign, there is sandbox mode, challenge mode and a free play mode. You can play on planets, that are procedural created according to player set parameters - for instance like inTropicowhere you can choose size of the map, the amount of resources, etc... - what makes the gamea good value.(It seems that there is the idea of exchanging planets with your friends, competing for highscorse, but I can not confirm this.)The controlsare very simple and easy to pick up right away. One click opens the menu, one click lets you choose, one click places the building.Flaws:As much as I enjoy Imagine Earth, there are two downsides. Even though the planets look beautiful, they feel a bit sterile, as streets stay empty, for example. Where are your 1.5 billion inhabitants? Building big cities is fun and the realy look cool as large skyscrapers emerge, but there is now life in the game. There are neither people or cars (like in Anno, where you get the impression of a busy citylife), nor animals roaming on the map.The other minor flaw is, that you cant buy 5 buildings in a row, as you have to open the menu, select the building and place it for every building. Which I find a little unpractical and thus ironic in a game, that focus on maximizing efficiency.Sum of us:This game is what I expected when I first got my hands on ""Reus"". If you were, like me, disappointed by Reus - even though solely based on your own false expectations - then this game is for you. If you like building simulations and management games, this game also is for you. If you are still sceptical, thefree demois for you.Imagine Earth is charming, challenging, a good value and a game of plain fun."

I have to admit the game got my attention over a year ago since it is about the consequences of environmental pollution. Since when I first bought the game the devs put a lot of work in the game with frequent updates. Keep up the nice work! Also, they focus (in my opinion) on the most important part of a game, the GAMEPLAY.The game is about building colonies on different planets which can be done either in a couple of campaign missions, the endless game mode or in a competition mode against AI players. The world is a sphere with a triangular grid. The core mechanic is to place buildings on the grid and have and eye on the adjacency of buildings. There are some buildings that boost each other and buildings that reduces the efficiency of other ones. Of course, the environment also has influence on buildings, so it is a good thing to place a sawmill directly next to a forest but placing an oil platform next to a fish farm is not so good >.<.  So additionally, to optimizing the limited space you also have to manage the adjacency of the buildings too.Basically, you are building both a city out of different parts and the industry supporting it. You have to balance between population, production and pollution. Overproduction of energy, food and goods can be sold. There is also a science tree where you have to choose what you want to build or upgrade.They also added enemy factions which you have to deal with, additionally to environmental hazards. It really is difficult to maintain a healthy environment when you have to compete against an opponent.Before concluding, I will list some pros and cons about the game.Pro:Very good core gameplay.Different game modes and a campaign (Which is very good for the current state).A simple but good economics system. Not too complex but not too simple either.A high replay value, since you can try the same scenarios with different strategies even though you have to adapt to    the environment.Constantly Updated.Contra:Don’t expect too much from the graphic effects, here is a lot room for improvement.The presentation of the campaign is boring (typical text boxes) which is a pity since the mission design itself is well done.The music is nothing special (However, this a problem most games in the genre have).Neutral:The controls are ok. Though, they could improve some minor things like the navigation on the Planet. E.g. zooming in where my cursor is not the camera center.Some people complain about the User Interface, I think it is ok though. Again, it is certainly not the best I have seen but it does its job and didn’t have problems with it.Regarding the graphics, effects, 3D models and textures aside. I think the best improvement would be to add more animations. I have to compare to Anno2070 here, since what made the graphics so nice were the many details, the moving parts of the factories or the farming robots and the flying cars in the city. You always had stuff to look at. Maybe working with such things is a better improvement than cranking up the texture resolution or things like that.All in all, I really enjoy the game 😊"

It is easy to pick up the basics, but definitely takes skill to get good at it.The gameplay is great, despite the graphics not being the best on the market. Considering this is an indy title, it really needs to get more attention as a great addition to a difficult-to-please genre of players.Look at the negative comments for the game - none of them complain about gameplay. Its all taste-based comments or something that's not an issue like expecting world-class graphics from an indy team. The negative comments don't complain about the gameplay, because the game is fun and challenging.Would love to see how this game ends up at release. Fantastic game so far - This could become a benchmarking game for the genre."

You have to balance the intensity of each resource, you may need energy, food, money; but also you may break the balance of the planet so you will need to invest in ecologic projects... The different types of city districts bring variety.I miss units to do stuff, may be exploration as well, because the resources and the map of the game is known from the begining."

76561198256879294,Recommended,280720,28361592,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,TheAnonymous1,"Imagine Earth is a sort of simplified city building game with an easily understood user interface and light hearted characters to meet with somewhat cartoonish nature. You are a colony manager and you build cities in sandbox or campaign with the limit of how much punishment the planet can take before eco collapse. It is a fun game to play if you have a little free time, but I will say that it gets somewhat boring after 20 hours or so. The game is almost to simple sometimes because once you build your city to a good size, then it is smooth sailing until you either stop expanding or destroy your colony with a environment collapse (unless you are in the campaign then you finish the mission). One thing I really found annoying was the tech tree because you earn tech points over time building cities to invest in the tree. You can also buy tech from traders, but once a decision is made, you have to live with it for every new game you start. You cannot start the tech tree over, but buy techs that counter it and this applies to every sandbox and campaign mission started. I will rate the game recommended because it in early access and still is updating regularly. It was fun for a short time, but I would have gotten it on sale If I had the opportunity to start over."

I didn't listen.I'm maybe 5 hours in, on the third storyline mission, and I'm done.Caveat:  I know this is early access.[x] Has overly complicated menus and inaccessible shortcuts.I don't find this to be true.  Once familiarized with them, they are very cut and dry and easily accessible contextual menus.  The problem is, they spent so much time on this, it seems they forgot to use them to actually create gameplay.  One possible solution should be a starting tooltip that hovering a bit over options brings up an extended description.[+] Seems like a mobile app/simple/quickly bored.Have to agree here, as the gameplay is so simplistic, you quickly lose the will to continue.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you do come away feeling you paid for more than was delivered.  Given the foundation they've laid with the gameplay, I don't think this will change.  There is no pull to continue as it is just more of the same.[x] It is slow and perforance is bad.I didn't have this problem, and it played quite nicely in that regard.[x] Terrible graphics.I disagree, I found them to be highly representative of what they needed to be for gameplay on the map, and found them unifying and endearing.  The characters, on the other hand, while trying to be uniform with accessiblity and simplicity, end up being cheesy and a mood killer.  They don't jive with the on-planet gameplay.  Or maybe I'm just old and can't stand childish crap anymore.[x] Can only play one way - a tree hugger.I didn't find this to be true, either.  There are plenty of upgrades/technology to assist with this and maintain a blended approach.  I mean, part of the game is to make sure the environment doesn't collapse, so you should at least have an inkling starting out that you can't wontonly pollute without consequence.---I do like several elements of gameplay that make it easy and accessible, such as the trading interface - no reason to be complicated there, very straight-forward.  I liked the influence indicators when building, which helped to find the right combos/locations for buildings.  Heck, looking back over this review, I guess the main problem is there just wasn't enough meat to the game.  I paid $20 to assist production, but didn't get that value from current gameplay.  A bit more depth with future development before release, and I'd probably change my recommendation."

So, this is not one ofthoseearly releases.On the actual gameplay, it's an entertaining simulation, where you're having to develop a colony, with pre-set victory conditions in each level. You can't use all the buildings and techs every time, so you end up needing to be selective on what you develop and coupled with that is the risk of runaway global warming, which results in failure. Added to that is time trials, challenges, free play and planet creators, so it's got a decent amount of replay value to it too.It's a pretty chilled game, which however can put the pressure on at times. For the price it is, I would definitely say it's entertaining and enjoyable enough to be totally worth it."

,Recommended,280720,34473574,Posted: 24 August,all,Machismo01,"This has shaped up to be a really good game. It is satisfying with the layers of content and systems. Consider an ecological Civ-ish game where the focus is mainly on building large or lots of cities and strong economy. Make money, but don't drive the environment into collapse.Each mission supports some degree of progression from the last (mainly the tech tree unlock).Planet building has a number of puzzle-like elements requiring some thought and planning unique to the resources and layout of the planet. For example, a wood good structure produces quite a bit more wood if next to forests. Cities require adjacent urban centers to level up. These types of system add constant limits to what you can do, but there seems to be always a way around it. It results in a really fun gameplay loop that is always teaching you."
,Recommended,280720,35078227,Posted: 19 September,all,Stryderunknown,"This is a mix of City builder and Strategy game since the triangular tiles that each building type occupies can only be bordered by three other tiles that have either negative or positive influences.  It has similarities to Anno in having requirements to upgrade tiles (like needing more than one food type or good) The hours I've spent so far have been attempting to be a completionist with the missions since each campaign mission has a number of objectives to complete.Some  of the objectives  are completed by just following the narrative, The one that is a little awkward is the objective that requires you to treasure hunt a particular special resource, as finding it can be simple, getting it in your zone of control however is a different story.There is an online leaderboard for players to compare scores in how well they did, currently the scores look like people have actually be playing it rather than just manipulating it and getting to the top of the board.  I don't know how long that will last though.Currently it appears the game actually has a pretty small footprint in regards to download size (currently less than 1Gb) so for those of you that don't want to spend hours downloading larger games, this might well be one for you.

Full disclosure, I've only played roughly 7 hours. The 40 hrs shown is mostly time where I left the game open hoping I'd be inspired to open it back up and play. I really wanted to like the game but instead, I just wish I kept my money.The vibe of the game just feels off. It's a little tacky (the art style of characters is ugly and no animations) and I'm not big on the triangle layout. The soundtrack is also terrible adding to the queezy vibe of the game. The planet itself is cool looking but that's it. It would be awesome if there was more of a city building aspect to it where you could lay your own roads and then place living quarters, factories etc. but you can't. It's just plop plop plop. It seems like residents will move in to the plopped cities regardless of anything. You should have to attract people to your colony, no? It would be cool if you could explore other planets and work on them simultaneously building a network of trade and things like that as well. Another addition that I would suggest is some kind of war mechanic where you could take out another planet either economically or through brute force. Its also just so vague. I was spending euros and never really realized how much money I had. I never couldn't afford anything so it just felt hollow. You basically spend time maximizing a limited build area.I see the release date was MAY 2014 so this does not give me much hope that future updates will improve the overall problems with the game.I really hope this game improves so I can get my monies worth."

So when I saw Imagine Earth, I thought it might be another take on the concept. Sadly, it fell just a few yards short of a touchdown.Imagine's gameplay just feels clunky, from setting up cities to the requirements for upgrades to actually expanding your colony. The upgrades system especially feels odd, considering you're working for a corporation having there be population marks to meet rather that using your money as an alternative feels tricky. Also, there feels to be too much of a limit on what you're capable of doing, though since this is still in early access I know things will change. Maybe making the planets a bit bigger and offering alternative methods to gain technologies and licenses?Right now, I can't recommend Imagine, but maybe it'll surprise me in the future."
