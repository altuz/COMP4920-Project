,Recommended,280830,12971541,"Posted: 16 November, 2014",all,fegmur3,"This recommendation comes with quite a few caveats. This game is basically a poor man's Super Mario Strikers. It's 5-on-5 (counting the goalies) soccer with environmental hazards and various special moves. It's fun in a very goofy way. The English seems odd, there are bugs (including a few frustrating ones that stop the match and force the user to quit or retry), and the AI could use a little tweaking. The developer is aware of some of the issues, but they haven't updated the game for months, so I don't think we're going to see any fixes. Overall, it's fun, cheap, and goofy, so it might be worth your time and money."

76561198096000709,Recommended,280830,10590793,"Posted: 20 June, 2014",all,The Nitrous oxide Wolf,"This is a okay game. The art style fits what it's advertizing and it's just a soccer game. The nice thing about it is the really low minimum requirements. The gameplay is simple, however it's STRONGLY reccomended to use a gamepad since most (if not all) of the menu is all xbox 360 buttons. One gameplay mechanic is the use of two round in one match. Each round is essentially a new game with about 3 minutes to score on each others. There are some bugs, when I shot the ball and it went in the net... it counted as a ""penalty shot"" not a goal. Other then that it's simple but not really worth the full retail price it's asking, get it on sale."

,Recommended,280830,11909401,"Posted: 29 August, 2014",all,Oafah,"This is a highly entertaining little soccer game, and a fantastic 4-player couch co-option for a group of friends. The controls can feel a tad wonky and delayed at times, but it's not a significant detractor from what is, overall, supposed to be very light hearted and a bit ridiculous. You can usually pick this up in a bundle or heavily discounted from its already low price of $5, and I strongly suggest you do."

The controls are creepy, gameplay is not fun.Game is buggy also, I think this is going to be fixed, but I doubt gameplay is going to be much better.It feels like that 80's soccer arcade games with magnetic legs and iron balls... just worst."

I've got a buggy game that has absolutly nothing to do with that kinda game. It's more like the dev's thought: A come on, lets make a copy of that Mario Soccer game from Gamecube. But let us forget that unimportant stuff like graphics, sound, gameplay, AI and that other useless crap.Pro- the idea, I like arcade soccer games- the Xbox360 controller worksContra- the graphics suck like hell, the game starts stuttering after 10 minutes of playing (I7, 8gb Ram, Radeon R290! oO)- the sound is terrible- the AI really really terrible, I don't think I have seen worse... and I'm a gamer since 22 years now.- there is no online multiplayer, why? with this one of the biggest fails would be pointless (the AI)- Story Mode? Pacman had a better Story Mode....I like indie games. But this is not one of the good one..."

For example: the ball got stuck behind the player during kickoff and the game froze -we had to restart the match. All in all, had some brief moments of fun, but the controls need to be much tighter, and passes and kicks need to feel meatier."

,Not Recommended,280830,18716328,"Posted: 27 October, 2015",all,Stelios78910,"Apparently this is based off a film, the game doesn't make it that clear but to be fair the occasional bouts of bad English in this game may've made that slip under the radar. Regardless since I don't know much about the characters as the game really just assumed I did with their quick and abrupt introductions, I couldn't really enjoy the story, the core gameplay is alright but with a few control issues for keyboard users. Can not speak for the controllers, overall the game is okay but not worth over a quid I'd say."

In my opinion , there is a very low amount of football games that change the nature of the game and are still successfull. Foosball Street Edition  was not suceesfull.Gameplay : 30/100 - Very confuse. I do not understand what was going on and it just simply did not looked natural . I know it is supposed not to be natural , but still.. It is not satisfatory.Sounds :  45/100 - Very basic stuff. Not very appealing.Graphics :   45/100  - Still very basic stuff. I played similar games in my phone. In fact, they had better graphics and a more demanding engine.Overall I give this game a evaluation of 40/100I do not recomend."
