,Recommended,280910,9788991,"Posted: 11 April, 2014",all,Old Roy,"While similar to Race the Sun, I had much more fun with T.E.C. 3001!  A great run/dodge game to test one's hand-eye coordination, I whole-heartily recommend T.E.C. 3001 - especially if you like racing games!Since I am an old fart, I appreciated the levels that locked you to your lane; this actually made it like a different game, as the ""regular"" levels have momentum to think about... can't just twitch through it!  Excellent variety!The graphics are clean and crisp, nothing jaw-dropping, but this game should not be played for graphics alone (should any game?); the soundtrack is well-fitting, techno-based that completes a solid package of a game.  For the price, just buy it.I use Linux (Mint 16 x64 Xfce) and the game runs very smooth (nVidia driver).  It is a great casual game that one can play for 30 seconds or 30 minutes."
,Recommended,280910,9804272,"Posted: 13 April, 2014",all,Flemingo,"After playing a bit of this game now I feel I can write an honest review on it, so here goes.T.E.C 3001 is a runner, where you control a robot through various courses in different game modes. The campaign consists of 3 game modes, a freerun mode, a speed run mode and a drag race mode. On top of these campaign gamemodes there is a seperate mode to play which is the unlimited runner mode.In freerun mode, you get full control of your character to jump between the various levels and layers of the pre-generated worlds. You can use all the controlls, boost, slide, jump and double jump to traverse the areas, being faced with obstacles like barriers and walls you can slide under, and speed boost power ups. Freerun requires you to take full advantage of these abilites, by facing you with walls that require precision timing for you to dodge past. This is where the game really shines, as you are not on set tracks and are free to jump away from the path entirely, only to come back in having looped around a tough obstacle. Throughout these stages there are checkpoints, so if you muck up right near the finish line you won't have to start from the very beginning which is a very forgiving bonus. These levels don't require you to take a set path, you can alternate between the many layers of the track at will which gives every replay a unique feeling and keeps the track fresh, for a time anyway.Speed Run mode is a more traditional runner mode, reminiscent of games like Temple Run. You are stuck to one course where you must simply dodge the obstacles that are presented. You use the arrow keys to switch between the three lanes, having no option to jump out of the track like you can in Freerun. The tracks are usually straight forward and require you to pick up the collectables to finish.Drag Race mode requires you to time your boosts, bound to the up arrow, to speed up and finish the course before the time is up. The obstacles in this mode are straight forward, and unlike the other two modes there is no way to switch between lanes. You are bound to the middle lane and must time your boosts with the icons on the track to get enough speed in time.Unlimited Runner is more of a side mode, you won't be spending as much time on it as the campaign unless you like the feel of an endless track runner. It is a randomly generated track, built on the Speed Run mechanics, so there's not much to say about it.Now these are my opinions on the gamemodes. Freerun, as I already stated, is certainly the strong point of the game. It is interesting and tries its best to stay that way, and will be the mode you look forward to while playing the campaign. Speed Run is fun, but gets old quickly. It is more enjoyable to play in the form of Unlimited Runner in my opinion because this really extends the longevity of it and allows for high score beating and the like. Drag Race feels like it was thrown in as a filler, because I honestly don't have much fun with it at all. It's repetive, and feels like a grind to complete, and not a unique experience. It gets boring quick and you probably won't look forward to playing it, or not as much as other modes.For the price, T.E.C 3001 is an amazing game. It offers quite a bit of gameplay while staying fresh and interesting besides a few letdowns. It has simplistic yet beautiful visuals and a nice soundtrack, and is a great experience. If I were to change anything about it, it would be to remove the Drag Race game mode and try to add even more variety to Freerun (Tracks that curve upwards, requiring you to run on the roof?) and possibly some more variety to Speed Run to make it feel less repetitive. Other than these slight hinderances, it's almost a garaunteed buy for me and a rating of 8/10."

,Recommended,280910,16507225,"Posted: 18 June, 2015",all,RockstarCRO,"Plain in simple in it's delivery, but engaging while playing. T.E.C is a 3D linear running game.This game feels like it was greatly paid attention to, from the gameplay to the visual details and music. There are three basic modes to T.E.C. The first requires you to run in a straight line and commit to certain dodge techniques. The second sort of works like a grid system, where acceleration and top speed rise sharply and quick manouevers are needed. The third mode consists of free running, where the player is in full control of every tilt their player makes. This last game mode is what makes this game unique. There are levels where I've felt I've barely made the turn but still managed to make it to the end. The free running is extremely fun as you'll quickly be jumping platform to platform (which go in all directions).One thing I've noticed in free running is some courses require the player to make 360 degree turns running up a platform. As the joystick is held in one direction, the player finally starts leaning inwards making a sharper turn, while the camera begins to rotate over the shoulder. This is a cool concept, and makes for a great visual, but can make it hard to control the runner accurately. I also have no idea how to reset the camera back to normal when that happens. On top of creative level design and good control schemes, the game offers local co-op on top of multiplayer. Third and first person views are also a feature in the game.The visuals are appealing, and game (and menu) colors change with each color-icon you hit. Graphics are sharp but there seems to be more room for improvement here. The backgrounds are quite plain. Level designs are immaculate as there is no one way to go about your business, which makes it welcoming to local co-op. Sounds are few but on point. I like when the runner jumps from a height and that smashing metal sound plays. Music seems to be original and some tracks are quite catchy.For future T.E.C games, perhaps make a ""fight"" mode for local co-op where players can run into one another, or perhaps strike each other as a distraction. Also, maybe having an options to designate sensitivity of the joystick would be appreciated, unless the dev's wanted this certain feel.RATING : 7.35/10GameplayB+Story / CampaignB-Visuals / User InterfaceBSounds / MusicB-Replay-abilityB-OverallB-ScreenShots :The free form control I was speaking of as well as multiple choices for routesYou can slide in third person or first personProof of the third or first person view optionsAny game that has double jump, I am a huge fan of"

The colors and feel of the game remind me of Audiosurf which is not a bad thing at all. Not too difficult, but has a challenge to it.  The achievements are unlocked once you minimize or completely close out of the game. All in all, it’s a great game that is addicting and worth the low price it’s at...

If you're interested in the feel of speedrunning without spending hours plotting your own route or learning the minute specifics of a game engine, definitely check this out.Check the screenshots/video on the store page to see what the game's going to look like; if you like that visual style, you won't be disappointed. The visual feel is very ""'80s cyberspace""...the same kind of vibe as Lawnmower Man, but updated for modern graphics hardware. :) The audio is OK as well; I can only say ""OK"" because the game is so demanding of your attention that honestly I never had time to actually listen to the music. I did sample them from the pause screen, though, so I did notice they were pretty good.When I first started playing, the game seemed overly hard due to the (lack of) responsiveness of the character. To put it another way...you corner like a boat. A large boat...like a cruise ship. It's really frustrating in the beginning, because it feels unfair considering the speed that obstacles are coming at you. Hang in there, though; itdoesget easier. Well, I mean, it never gets any easier but you get better at it. You'll learn that the secret is to anticipate what's coming, and already be ready to get into position. Technically thatisa minus in my book, since I don't like when a game requires you to have already played the level to beat it. Having said that, the game is fun enough that it's still worth it.  It occurs to me, after further thought, that perhaps a counter-argument to this would be that if the characterwerethat responsive, you'd constantly be flying off the map due to over-sensitivity.Getting all the achievements is a serious challenge. Now, gettingmostof the achievements is relatively easy, once you've gotten good with controlling the character. But the last two (""Marathon"" and ""Unbreakable"") are no joke, and ""Undying"" isn't a walk in the park either (although I did manage to get that one). That said, for those of you that judge games based on their difficulty (Super Meat Boy fans, etc.) shouldn't pick this up for a persistent, serious challenge because the bulk of the gameplay is...well, it's not what you'd calleasybut it's definitely not Super Meat Boy.Fun game, and already one set of free content updates...good stuff!If you like this game, check out...Boson XCloudbuiltFOTONICAInfinity RunnerMirror's EdgeReview metadataDate of updateTime playedHow far in base game (estimate)?CostCost per hourNotes2014-05-10 00:0015.2 hours100% storyline complete, almost all achievements$3.99 USD$0.26 USDInitial review2015-03-15 02:5715.2 hours100% storyline complete, almost all achievements$3.99 USD$0.26 USDUpdated with new review format2015-03-15 05:4515.2 hours100% storyline complete, almost all achievements$3.99 USD$0.26 USDAdded suggestion for Boson X"

Even potatoes can run it.-Smooth animations.-Music you won't get tired of even if you play for hours.-Loving the colorscheme change.-You can get creative when it comes to passing hard obsticles.Cons:-Not for people who give up easily when things get difficult.-The later stages can be really frustrating.-When you accidently go through a checkpoint when you're slowed down you have to reset the whole stage.Overall this game is amazing and provides you with hours of fun and insanity.

,Recommended,280910,9885330,"Posted: 20 April, 2014",all,cn,"T.E.C. 3001 is as if Audiosurf, Tron, Wipeout and/or Trackmania had a kid and decided to let it run free until the end of time.If you ever enjoyed dodging the grey blocks in Audiosurf, you'll definitely like what the Endless mode has to offer, as it is nearly identical in feel; three lanes, near instant switching between them, and obstacles that you have to jump over, slide under or just plain avoid. It gets increasingly harder, and around 4,000 units, you'll even get to see gaps in the course that you'll have to jump across.There's also the campaign which lasts for a few hours on your first playthrough, although it's hypothetically possible to finish it in about 40 minutes. The campaign has three different modes that the varying stages make use of;The sprint mode is a one-lane course with obstacles, boosting panels and batteries to charge your own boost meter that you can use. The timelimit of these are often strict, and you might just end up having to grind it out 'til near perfection.There's also a freerunning mode that lets you have more free reign over the controls, but it feels vastly different from the other two modes. It does, however, feel like the ""main"" mode of the campaign. The level design of these levels are generally great, while the other two modes have the movement-limits and thus also in a sense limit the level design.The third and final mode is just as the endless mode, although with static levels instead of randomly generated ones. This also means that there could be elevation differences and other elements that you normally won't find in the endless mode.Overall, it's a game well worth the few bucks if you're into this kind of game, be it through its aesthetic feel or through gameplay. With the Steam leaderboards you may just end up hooked, like I am!"

Most levels are very hard and require you to learn to manoeuvre your robot very precisely. And even then, a lot will often depend on sheer luck, and you will die dozens of times before you succeed.There is a large variety of stages, from high speed ones, to the more aerial ones where you perform numerous jumps between platforms, and so on. Some take a form of drag race, where you must time your boosts accurately, others are more open and have multitudes of paths to take through a level.The main 'campaign' has 41 levels. There are a lot of tough, frustrating moments, but strangely enough you will keep coming back to the game repeatedly to try and beat the level you're stuck on. Once you complete the campaign, you unlock several bonus levels, which, from what I played so far, seem even harder than the original campaign ones. You also have an endless run level, where you keep running and dodging obstacles for as long as you can.The game has a very nice visual style and cool electronic music. All this helps to enhance the virtual reality atmosphere the game is going for. If high speed challenging games are your thing, then give this game a try."

After coming back, it just feels so dull, like something is missing.  It's not awful by any means, but it's failing to light that spark of interest and excitement.  After a bit of considering, I think it's because it feels less like a racing or speedrunning game and more like a fast-paced puzzle game.  Your speed is pretty much determined for you, the tracks are narrow and restrictive, and the mechanics are too shallow to allow anything beyond following the instructions and laid-out collectibles and pre-set best route.  The audiovisuals don't help much either, with a bit of a cheap presentation to them, even with the minimalistic virtual theme."

A great run/dodge game with challenging levels, clean and crisp graphics, awesome soundtrack. Its a cool game that one can play very quickly.T.E.C. 3001 is as if Temple runner, Tron, and Terminator had a kid and decided to let it run free until the end of time. The metal dude himself is very cool looking.  If Terminator, Metallo, Silver Surfer, and Iron man got married and had a child, it would be this cool looking dude. Look at him, he looks so similar to them. Sounds like polygamy, but thats what it looks like, if men were to give birth to children.If you ever enjoyed dodging stuff in temple runner, and other runner games, you'll definitely like what the Endless mode has to offer, as it is nearly identical in feel; three lanes, near instant switching between them, and obstacles that you have to jump over, slide under or just plain avoid, for the rest of your freaking life.If it’s ever on sale, total steal.The only things i dont like is that the controller seems to not work unless i unplug and plug in the controller in the settings window that appears when i first open up the game, and i dont like how it crashes when i die too quickly"

Lane running is awesome until obstacles start to obscure your view...that makes it impossible to prepare for the next move, so you'll only have a split second to make the right decision. Do I jump, dodge, duck or stay in the air? Oops, too late...Free running is where the spatial awareness problems kick in real hard. You often have to make diagonal jumps, high jumps, descending jumps.....I guess you're supposed to calculate the arc of each jump...it didn't work out too well for me.Turning lanes are a nightmare as well. If you don't steer yourself perfectly, you're guaranteed to fly off the lane. It becomes a grind to get through every checkpoint after a while.If I managed to reach the end of a more complex level, it was through pure luck, never skill. This soured the experience for me beyond repair. It's too bad, because the feeling of speed is really good in this game, as well as the sound. The visuals were fine, but like I said...I couldn't spot the next obstacle in time if my view was obstructed, if I was moving diagonally, or if there was a large height difference between lanes. Perhaps a more zoomed out camera could have helped my situation...I'm more used to sidescrolling runners, which are much easier to navigate.I wish I could upvote this game, but I had no fun with it whatsoever :("

The timing for double jumping feels off. GUI did not feel cohesive with having little to no options in game and having game settings outside the game before you launch it. It has a repetitive visual theme with the only minimal options to change its color.This game type has the potential to be good both in experience and in replay value. Add some banking turns or half pipes. Change the theme to running in a forest or the surface of a lake. Freedom of movement is somewhat an illusion with this game. So it can almost be said that because of the minimal effort taken on polishing this game for the PC that this game is not worth the cost.With game modes like endless run it would be good to have something like a mp3 player in the background because the in game music gets old fast.Wait for a sale to get this one if you are interested.

(You can keep boosting constantly in this game, but for some reason when i'm in the air it doesn't boost half the time, causing me to have to restart from the last checkpoint and do the same thing until it works) This causes every free running levels to be a nightmare if i choose to pass the obstacles the way that they were built (ex jumping over or between a wall rather than avoiding it by going around) But the difficult paths are the only ones that actually give me any enjoyment, bypassing all the obstacles is simply boring.In the little time that I have played it, this issue of the game being unresponsive (which is not a problem with my controls, they work with every other game) has caused me to be infuriated beyond belief.

It features a small variety of modes, ranging from the familiar three-line obstacle course (in finite or infinite flavours), to key-press timing challenges, to a 'vanilla' parkour mode, Being someone who enjoys Race the Sun quite a lot, this game was right up my alley,While, except for the 'endless mode', the game is not procedural, it nevertheless offers a nice range of levels that ramp up in difficulty very smoothly, ensuring that you are rarely left unchallenged as you fine-tune your skills. Each level feels just challenging enough and completing them is always satisfying. However, at least so far, I have found very few areas that have caused genuine frustration in me, and none that utterly made me abandon the game in dispair.As one would expect from such a simple game, there are no bugs or other issues to really speak of.The soundtrack is also pretty damn great."

The only runner that can be beter then this one is mirrors edge and they can be compared. What i most liked about this game is that although it is a linear running game the free running stages let you brake the limits with the various number of moves lke the jump the double jump the dash and the slide and your able to do things that seem like you werent suposed to do. This is the best game to give a genuine sensation of speed because when the robot is running at maximum speed it feels heavy  with  very good visual and sound effects it has decent grphics for what it is . It s really fun has a lot of levels and it is challlenging and doesnt get boring until youve went through the 53 levels at least twice. It is possible to return to a level and try to pull off awesome tricks or get a different path youwent the first time. There is also a multiplayerfor 1 keyboard only that is also very fun and competitive if you have a friend to play with but the biggest problems i found with this is that you need to be qite a lot of time binding the keys so 2 people cn play with all the moves. I give this game a 7/10 in the videogame category and a 10/10 in the runner category. Also for people that have the game try to unlock the bonus level ¨missing one battery¨ it is the best of the game.
