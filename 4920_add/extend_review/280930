,Recommended,280930,11781666,"Posted: 19 August, 2014",all,Jedo,"Battlepillars is a cool tug-of-war game that has great value and a decent spectrum of difficulty (towards the end). It gives you about 10+ hours of content with a few types of challenges for various campaign levels. The bosses during the later half of the game also require a bit of contemplation and strategizing because they start becoming a bit more challenging.As an added bonus, the multiplayer was seamless and I had no issues whatsoever while achievement hunting with a friend.It's one of the more casual strategy games out there in the same price range but it was definitely quite fun. I definitely recommend it whether you are buying it for your phone or on Steam."
76561197961494531,Recommended,280930,9964574,"Posted: 28 April, 2014",all,Rapscallion,"Battlepillars was originally a phone game, and it certainly shows. But does that mean that this isn't any fun? Certainly not.Here's a Quick Look video of what you should expect when heading into this. Take a look if you're interested or just read my summary of the game below. Just a warning though, it has birds carpet bombing with their crap.http://youtu.be/cpoGKJ-wYVwI'll start by saying the basic premiss of this game is a tug-of-war between two sides, something you've probably seen before in other games. But does this do anything different? No, not really. However, it's still pretty fun to play.You construct your units with a regenerating resource that can be upgraded to regen faster for the same resource, the cost gaining in price every time. The units  themselves are mashed together by a decent number of parts you can select before going into the match, and each one does different things, such as make your guy charge faster, shoot enemies at a distance, knock the enemy backwards, set up mines, poison an enemy, heal the soldier over time, and so on. The charm to it is constructing the unit you want to make and seeing it charge into battle and (hopefully) crush your foes. You just have to keep in mind that even though you're creating a stronger unit, it costs more to make it while the enemy might be swarming in on you.The other fun part to this game is customizing your soldiers with skins and upgrades, and you can choose which upgrades/skins you want without having to go through others first, which is always appreciated. I also like how open ended this game is about beating certain levels/challenges. There isn't always a correct way to go about something to achieve victory. You can either spam out fodder to overwhelm your enemy, have a mix of certain parts that benefit off each other, or have titans with every expensive part you can throw on it that stomp mostly anything in their path. There's just a good number of things you can do.But lets talk about some of the negatives now. Because this is a phone port, there isn't much interaction with you and what's happening on the field. You're kind of farting around and waiting to send out your next unit. While it is fun to to watch your units do the work, I wish there was more you could do than just summon an animal friend.I'm also not a fan of buying straight upgrades for parts you already own. That doesn't encourage swapping parts from ones that you made better than others. I much rather play with a different weapon to give my units than use the same ones for every mission simply because the game is that much easier with them. The fact that the game limits how many parts you can take into battle also irks me. There could've been a lot more depth to the game if you could always choose a counter unit to what your enemy was sending at you instead of being stuck with what you chose and hoping it works out.But to sum this game up, even with the lack of interactivity, this is still a solid title for under 3 bucks currently, and possibly still worth it for 5 if you enjoy a decent time waster. The multiplayer options also open this game up for more fun if the campaign and endless modes aren't your thing."

Its a pretty fun push style game where you get full customizable control of your units. It can feel a bit spammy in the beginning but as you get to later levels more strategy is involved with how you build your units. Overall a really cool idea executed well, only downside is the MP seems to be a bit dead."

There is nothing so satisfying as having your base being bombarded and then turning the battle right at the end. The graphics are delightfully cartoonish and watching your battlepillars bounce their way to their doom is fun. The game suffers slightly from ""repeat-itus,"" but it is something that can be looked over if you are a fan of strategy games.8/10"

76561197971341065,Recommended,280930,28253724,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,sfnhltb,"A fun tug of war game where you pick weaponry and amount of segments desired for your battlepillars and send them across the screen to engage the enemy who is doing the same. Various weapons are better in some situations that others, so you have to pick with care and react to what the enemy is doing, as well as determine if you want to armour up or hope to blast the enemy before you take too many casualties.There is certain a lot to experiment with, as the various weapons systems are very distinct with different damage levels, ranges, side effects, as well as some other segments to add armour, slow the enemy, or apply a damage over time effect, etc. You also have to factor in length - the longer battlepillars have more health and survivability as well as firepower (normally), but move slower across the screen - so if you want to use heavy armored battlepillars with lots of segments to defend ""glass cannon"" units that do the damage you will need to plan ahead to ensure they get there before the previous one dies.The single player campaign is pretty good, there is a reasonable amount of variation even apart from the boss fights which mix things up further, and of course you unlock new weapons and upgrades as you go along. Multiplayer is presumably pretty dead unless you have some friends to play with that probably isn't going to be a reason to get it at this point. Overall though, it is an easy recommend even for just the single player portion."

You build up caterpillars using leaves which you gather over time, and you make caterpillars using different segments.It's an interesting game, and quite entertaining I find especially just to play for a little bit here and there. And it is still relatively challengling(Or maybe I just suck at it, unsure.)I think especially if you can get it on sale like I did, it's totally worth it. Not a game I would really see myself playing for hours on end, but its fun to play in short bursts. Building your own caterpillars and making them into an army to assasult the enemy caterpillars is strangely entertaining."

,Not Recommended,280930,12864802,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,Ndi,"The issues with this game are well captured on other reviews, I won't reiterate (I just wish I read them before).* No difficulty setting, game expects you to grind lower levels until you get what you need.* No buying guide. Game allows you to buy whatever you want, and the the AI assumes you have what you need to deal with rushes, not cool.* Minimal to no strategy. It seems like you conduct the battle, the the problem is that a specific set of tools will work on a specific level. Get in, get beaten, try again with a different combo, again, again, until you realize you don't HAVE what you need, so GOTO 10; (grind)* People put the gold challenges as a plus, but it isn't, because to get gold you need tools and tools cost apples and you get extra apples by getting gold, so you either have what you need and breeze the gold or you don't. Helps with the grinding, EXCEPT gold makes levels harder so it's not even grinding, it's hard grinding.Would I recommend this game? No. If I do, someone will pick it up, get stuck at the 10th level or so, flip it off and go to sleep, never to play it again. Why would I do that, when so many great games are on sale for less? And for what? I'm not condemning the graphics, or the gameplay, or the music (fix that loop, BTW, at some point it just ENDS), I'm condemning the laziness of the developers to put in difficulty, which is mandatory for casual gaming, and a mild hind on what should use for a particular map. I don't have infinite time to waste on trial and error. Some people do. They play on Normal/Hard. I don't. I play on easy with hints. In good games."

Even that was covered, if you put your mind set wise, just try to get the golden bonus for each level.Music for me got very annoying but was very easy to just turn off with no issue. It is good fun, and a challenging Tug of War game, the AI is not dumb. Each mission has its own ways of being beaten and just a matter of testing the waters or making your own path. I love the Slug medics, and wide options to choose from, for this price point, yes its worth your time.In this review I cover what you need to know, but I decided to do so in a fun manner, I hope you enjoy and check out other reviews here.https://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyschohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3om46orQnT4"

I was wrong, after I struggled finishing the 1st boss (seems like there is 8 of them) I got stuck on the first level of the second act. And seems like the only way to get by this level is upgrade your parts to be stonger. And if you upgraded your parts to play more of a rush tactic and face ennemies with flame bomb (which does AOE) and destroy any weak unit, well you're screwed. You need to go buy some other part and upgrade them which cost you 150 apples(currency of the game) and you get around 12-14 per level. So go play 20-30 times the same level in order to level up a bit to get by this level. SO MUCH FUN! It seems like this game was made for android and you could pay to buy apples to get un-stuck from harder levels. Had fun for 30 minutes. Uninstalled and will never play again."
,Recommended,280930,19852414,"Posted: 22 December, 2015",all,TheChainZKid,"This game is great. You basically put a lot of parts together to make a ""battlepillar"" and send it out to fight the enemy's battlepillars then the one that kills the other and advances towards the enemy base to destroy it. It's a lot more fun than it sounds, leading you to come up with new strategys left, right and centre to keep up with the enemy's strategy. The campaign mode is fairly long and has interesting modes and enemy strategys which change throughout but the best part of the game is grabbing a friend and going 1v1 where you and your friend will be frantically trying to outdo each ther in a battle of will. I highly recommend it."

I wish there was a 'neutral' button, not because the game's bad, because it's casual.+Funny game+Well-made casual+Nice upgrade system+Lots of armors, weapons+Achievements-A little'gay'-There are free and funnier games-Weak online gamingPROS1. Funny gameThe game's much funnier as it looks like, believe me! I bought it at a 75% discount and for the first ten or or fifteen minutes I thoughtwhat the f'ck am I playing? Don't even believe I bought it. Just gonna give a chance then leave. But turns out that the experience was better than I expected and I'm completely sure I wasn't the only one who thought like that.2. It's a well-made casualEvery single detail was well drawn and well thought. The leaves falling on the ground, the 'pillars crawling to attack, the weapons animations, everything. It sounds stupid - but it's not, having a well created game, even if the concept is not good(not saying this game concept is bad, just giving an example), boosts the gaming experience a ton times.3. The upgrade system is coolIt has a very nice upgrading system where, unlike almost all other games upgrade trees you usually afford useless (sometimes expensive things) to reach the stronger ones, this game allows you to focus on what you need.4. A considerable amount of armors and weapons are availableLots of weapons and armors are available! Lots of them! Thus, the game is way more personal and less linear, you can evolve the way you want and follow the upgrades you want. The upgrades can be related to 'pillar skins (generally armor or life upgrades), 'pillar segments (support and attack upgrades) and various others, such as increasing leaf regen or you tree maximum life.5. Ingame achievementsThe game has Steam and ingame achievements (the golden leaf). Earning any ingame achievement earns you more money to upgrade your soldiers, upgrading them probably will give you more achievements and so on.CONS6. A childish interfaceDespite the game being awesome, its interface is waaay too childish - even though is a more complex strategy game than it looks. The point is: there's no problem for you if you intend to buy this game but if you do so you'll probably want to play alone. If you have roomates or relatives constantly passing close to your computer there's a very big chance (if not certain), that you will be mocked. You shouldn't even discuss this game with other people that are not close friends, or else there's a possibility they may guess you're a little childish, or even gay (not saying it's a bad thing, okay, just poiting this out). This is, in my opinion, the most important topic of this game. If you urge to buy it please consider this topic 6 strongly.7. Free and funnier similar gamesYea, despite this game's great there are other free and even funnier games! One of them is the [/i]Epic War[/b]. Here are some of their best games with the same line of thought of Battlepillars and even better graphics, made of Flash:Epic War 3Epic War 4PalaDogEpic War 5Miragine War!They're all casual and more funny than 'pillars.8. Weak online roomsI've been playing since a long time and I've never (I repeatnever!) seen an online room to play with. That's not a problem and does not change gameplay but you should at least consider it if you will to play with someone or earn all the achievements."
