You start off with a meteor falling from the sky so you go to investigate. Once you get to the crash site this white blob jumps out from the meteor and at first you are scared of it but then you become curious and become frends! Once you get back to your treehouse base a jar of beans on the table next to your bed falls over and a single black bean falls out. The blob eats it and turns into a ladder allowing you to climb up to a higher level of your base.Throughout the game you will collect many different coloured beans that each allow the blob to change into a different form. You will need to use these to overcome obsticles and to safely get a boy and his blob to their next destination.Also did I mention you can hug the blob?"

I could only beat it with a Game Genie, though. I bought and played through the Wii version, also. I loved it for different reasons. One of them being: You can beat it without a Game Genie.This appears to be a faithful and stable port of the Wii version. I find the game incredibly nostalgic and lovely in many ways. This is likely the influence of the game's director, Sean Velasco  (The director and designer of Shovel Knight).Sure it is more linear and not as challenging as the original. But it captures the soul of AB&HB and presents it in a more light-hearted (and finishable) package.Skip one trip to Starbucks this week and give it a whirl."

I haven't tried it with keyboard and mouse, but it works fine with my X Box controller. Controls are tight and simple. Beautiful animation, music, and sound. So far the port is exactly what it should be.So what is A Boy and his Blob?It's a remake of an 8 bit nintendo game that had an awesome concept without the capability to pull it off properly or do it any real justice. Basically, you are a boy who befriends an alien blob that eats jellybeans on a mission to save Blobonia from an evil tyranical emperor. Depending on what kind of jellybean he eats he will become different things. If you feed him a licorice jellybean he will become a licorice ladder for example. You use these various transformations to solve puzzles and traverse the levels. Unlike the old version, you will never run out of Jelly Beans so you don't need to worry about that. You are free to experiment although so far there has been only one right answer to the puzzles. Maybe that will change later on. I haven't played enough of it to determine the difficulty yet. I don't know how tough later levels get.If you like casual puzzle platformers you really really should have a look at this. I can't understand why this game was not a bigger hit on Wii. :( Anyway, all of this is a mere 9$. Come on! Grab yourself a pack of Jellybeans, sit back, and let boy and blob take you on an adventure!Oh, and there is a hug button. You can hug your blob, and it's the cutest thing in the history of video games."

You're toast if you become too complacent though as the difficulty really ramps up later on.Every level utilizes a different combination of transformations. The addition of a new forms and their uses in conjunction with other transformations really opens up each level to a tremendous variety of mechanics, a variety far greater than I typically see in puzzle platformers. As an added bonus, the collectable trinkets in each level decorate your home base. Kick♥♥♥♥♥The one glaring, unusual downside in this game is the lack of punctuality.Let's say an enemy is about to shoot me and I want to reflect the attack back at him. In order to do so I need to open the jellybean selection window, throw the jellybean, watch the blob chase it down and eat it, watch him become a sheild, walk to the sheild, pick it up, and finally engage the slow-moving reflect stance.Most games you just press L and you're immediately primed to reflect anything.By the time you pull out your sheild here though you've been shot, and your single hp is gone. You're dead and you get to start over. Thankfully checkpoints are very numerous and there's no life counter.If you've got a dozen hours to spare you should check out this wii-shop classic.By the way only about 1% of the people who started this game bothered to beat it. Not only are you stupid, but you're missing out."

Quite possibly one of the most charming games I have ever played also on the Nintendo Wii.A Boy and His Blob is simply put a game about a lone boy who happens to come across a space blob, reminiscent of Gleep and Gloop from the Herculoids. Almost instantly and without any influencing factors the boy and the blob create a bond. I mean even Elliot and E.T. had to work up to each other, and not without the help of some Reeses Pieces.The game takes place in a varying set of locations including forests, caverns, and more, made up with different levels. Each level features both platforming and puzzle challenges throughout as well as an assortment of enemy creatures also similar to our sidekick, the Blob. If you've ever played the original NES classic, you'll feel right at home with the games main feature, being that blob can transform into different objects through the consumption of different flavored jellybeans. This may again be somewhat of a throwback to E.T., though I don't know. You control the boy, and do the platforming, and feed the blob jellybeans and he transforms. The different objects the blob can transform into include things like ladders, trampolines, bubbles, and more. And each stage has a different set of jellybeans to help solve the different puzzles and even find hidden areas throughout. The platforming may lean a little more to the challenging side as opposed to being relaxed, as the ""boy"" does not have a very high jump. Luckily he does have air control. But his very small jump arc means jumping over some gaps and enemies requires good timing. It's not a constant thing, but you'll see how important it is in the very first stage. The game is extremely pleasant and magical looking, featuring hand-drawn characters and environments, and has said to have drawn ""inspiration from a number of sources, including the films of Hayao Miyazaki."". The music is equally enchanting featuring some nice relaxing medleys of both original pieces and even something for the fans of the original NES game.I did not want to make a big long review for the game itself but rather sum it up briefly. It's a great game! It's faithful to the original NES game in some ways, while still bringing its own originality and flavor to the new (when it came to the Wii) title.I actually wanted to instead discuss how the port is. So, how is it? Well, I'm really mixed on this one.Controls: The controls are all fully mappable on both keyboard and controller. This is a plus. I'm glad to see they did not take the easy way. There is no need to go into any menus either to switch between keyboard or controller. Just pick up and use whichever method of control you prefer.Graphic settings: This is where I'm a bit torn. There's not much here. You can change the resolution which is great. You can change the game from fullscreen to windowed to even borderless windowed, which is fantastic! But that is where it ends. I honestly did not expect things like aliasing options to be implemented. I mean the game looks fine on its own without the need for an aliasing option. Well maybe for the far background, but it's not a big deal. No, what bugs me instead is the lack of v-sync. A v-sync option is badly needed for this title. Right off the bat you can see screen tearing here and there. It's not a game breaking flaw, but for some people it is going to call a cause for complaints and gripes. And you know those people are going to be vocal about it. I personally would love to see a v-snc option patched in. Luckily some cards come with the option to force v-sync into games. But there are still some people playing without graphics cards who will see this as an issue.In any case, v-sync issue aside, this is a wonderful port, and  any fan of the original NES classic or someone who missed this title on the Wii should give this game a try."

Having grown up playing the original, I loved how charming it was, and it had unique mechanics that were never really duplicated in any game I can call to mind.This remake accurately takes the charm of the orginal and turns the dial up to 10. This game oozes charm, from the enemies, to the various forms your blob can assume, the artwork is gorgeous. Gameplay is decent, though somewhat monotonous, but the game isn't very challanging, and when it is challanging, its usually due to being unfair. What I mean is that some animations take so long (and there are ZERO invunerability frames) that a boss will kill you, or an enemy will kill you because your timing is off. The second boss in the game is exceptionally frustrating due to this. As well, the controls are very wonky for some of your blobs moves, not to mention you have to bash the call button a bajillion times to get him to come to you.So the breakdown:Pros-----* Gorgeous game* Accurately remakes an NES classic* OK puzzle/platforming gameplay* Charm out the wazoo* pretty long if you 100%Cons-----* Sometimes frustrating gameplay due to slow animations and wonky controls* Really easy when its not overly frustrating* Wish there was a true tutorial level...* 90% of the trophies are given on the last world, which is really weirdOverall I'd give this a 6/10. Not a must play by any means, but definitely one to pick up on sale if your a fan of the original, or just want some platforming action."

I also have a LOT of hours in the original NES and Gameboy versions of this game as well.So, having been playing this particular IP for most of my life, I feel confident in saying that this is not only a really good port of the Wii Version, but is still a fantastic reimagining of the original game.Basically, you are a young boy who was sleeping when the blob crashed to earth. You find him and become best friends! Then you find out that he can change shapes based on different flavors of jellybeans you can feed him!The graphics and story are charming, the gameplay is pretty normal for a platformer, with the changeable blob twist. He can become a ladder, a balloon, a hole in the ground (This one I'm still confused about) a trampoline, and so much more.If you are on the fence about buying this game, you should just end up landing very firmly on the side of buy it right now. I mean, at the 'full price' of $10 USD it's still a steal.Have fun blobbing!"

The transformations are done by feeding it a jelly bean. The levels each come with a unique set of jelly beans each with different transformations.THE GOOD:- Good value for money- Plenty of variety to keep you enterntained throughout the game- interesting puzzles.- Extremely cute, great to gift to a girlfriend. There is a hug button, just for the sake of hugging!THE BAD:- The plot has holes and is awkward at times, more effort could have been put into this.  The end of the story is surprising good and well done though as far as the story goes, so this is a inverse of the xen trope.- The controls are slow and unresponsive and most deaths you have will be because of the game, not because of mistakes you made, this becomes glaringly obvious at the end of the game where 95% of your deaths are due to the controls.- The level design starts of good but becomes increasingly bad towards the end of the game, only the plot makes it worth continuing.Overall, my feeling about this game is lukewarm, I weakly recommend it."

It’s lovely to look at, challenging to master, and undeniably heartwarming!That been said,while definately not a triple-A title, heart-warmingly cute hand-drawn graphics and decent puzzle gameplay make this inexpensive game a great value. A Boy and His Blob is a much easier remake of a brutally difficult classic NES game of the same name. In this version, you have unlimited jelly beans and lives, the interface clearly shows what each flavor does, and the game auto-checkpoints before each puzzle. You can die fairly easily, but with little consequence, which encourages a trial-and-error approach to the puzzles. There are plenty of levels, with optional chests to claim; fully completing a level unlocks the corresponding challenge level. The challenge levels rachet up the difficulty significantly, which may appease those who liked the original NES game!"

,Not Recommended,281200,25611951,"Posted: 20 September, 2016",all,Cpt. Moist Panties,"This game has the same issues that The Firefly Diaries has, which is another title on Steam (that I played on the PSVita).EverythingtakestooeffinlongThe game revolves around a boy that can only jump, and a blob that can transform into various items to traverse the landscape. It's a puzzle platformer, basically. You have a list of things your blob can turn into for a set level and pick it off a menu, changing the blob into said item requires you to drop a jellybean and the blob to walk to it and transform. My issue is how long this process takes.The game trudges along at a snails pace and whilst it's animation is simplistic but appealing, the simplest of things takes too long for how basic the task is. It sounds simple: the blob walks over to you, the blob transforms, you do what you have to do, then you call back your blob and move along. But the entire process is stretched out for as long as possible and the animations are slower than a cancer patient running a marathon. All the levels are simplistic and you're merely climbing small ledges and jumping over small pools but the entire process might take 10 or so seconds, which doesn't sound like a lot, but add that to an entire level consisting of minature basic puzzles like this and it's too slow and too boring.Similarly, merely walking across the screen was a long affair in The Firefly Diaries. It's like watching a game go in slow motion so you can do something incredibly simple. I don't understand why you make walking such a slow affair and then have me do that the entire game. It's like you want me to stare at the walls as I wait for me to walk across a bridge. It's agonizing more than anything. But to The Firefly Diaries credit it had puzzles and tasks that had some manner of complexity to them. This game, on the other hand, is really, really easy and simple.I'd suggest this game for anyone around the age of 5, and that's not an insult. I'm being sincere: the game's first world consists of looking at boards with drawings on them and going to the menu and picking out the item in the menu that looks like the drawing, then waiting for the drawn out animation to play out and then for the animation to call out for your blob to finish and for him to be by your side again.I understand what they were going for: innocence and warmth in the presentation and the 'experience'. As such having the gamer look and observe a significant amount throughout their playtime was a part of the goal, but it does nothing for me other than sacrifice from the actual time that I'm playing. I understand that characterization and story is carried not through text and dialogue but animation and presentation, which is why doing anything takes so effin long. But that's a problem when it comes to actually playing the game and not getting bored. I'm sure you can go about that without boring me with basic puzzles and a sluggish game. Also, this game is unreasonably scared of menus. You could forego the entire first world and get to harder levels if you just added menus and weren't so scared of breaking the ''video games are art'' thing you were desperately going for. Cause the entire first world might as well be a tutorial that could be rid of if you merely had a tutorial in the beginning.I don't mind watching movies with simple, basic plots that carry through characterization and empathy through the manner in which the characters are animated and react. Merely responding to a question or scenario might take 15 seconds as opposed to a thirller where there are quick cuts everywhere and you aren't given time to watch characters internalize and react to situations. This game is the former, but as a game it has failed to deliver an anjoyable experience."

This is for us old farts who remember the original NES ""A Boy and His Blob"" - this is nothing like it. If you, like me, are looking at this expecting a remake of a classic NES game, prepare for disappointment. The exploration of the underworld and Blobolonia is replaced by a level based puzzle game, where you're given an unlimited supply of just the beans needed to pass that level. No bean counting. No real experimentation to see what works where. No holes in the middle of nowhere and hoping you land somewhere soft.Taken on its own, I might give this a thumbs up.

Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, usually made possible by an impressive amount of object interactions and in-game physics for a 2D platformer.  80 stages (40 required, 40 optional) range in length from two minutes to twenty, for a satisfying 10-15 hours of gameplay that never wears out its welcome.  All this is bundled together with adorable hand-drawn sprites, gorgeous environments, and a rich orchestral soundtrack for an overall very enjoyable experience."
