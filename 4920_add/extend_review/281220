Not owning any consoles and being a PC gamer I thought I would never get the chance to play the next installment in the Bloodrayne series. So when I logged into Steam today and saw Bloodrayne: Betrayal had finally made it's way to PC at last, it was an instant purchase and I could not be more satisfied. This game is simply fantastic.The art style is phenomenal and the soundtrack is perfect for the relentless action going down on screen as you mutiliate everything in sight. The game looks beautiful and runs flawlessly without a hiccup. I highly recommend the Xbox 360 controller which also works and performs flawlessly as expected. I think it would be a very difficult game to play with keyboard and mouse and have not even attempted such myself.The controls themselves are pretty simplistic but seem to have a fair amount of depth to the different special moves and combos that you can perform. The game heavily encourages you to be stylistic and flawless in your execution with a grade scale for each level. It does not pull any punches and will force you to perfect your vampire slaying art, especially in the later stages. Nailing a fluid combination while dodging enemy attacks and dismembering and feeding on every enemy in sight is a thrill to see play out in perfect, gory animated detail.Rayne looks as sexy and deadly as ever and with Steam Achievements, Trading Cards and solid performance, this appears to be a fantastic PC port of the console version. If you're a fan of 2D side scrolling hack 'n slash-beat 'em ups, Bloodrayne or both, you definitely do not want to miss this game. It's quite possibly the best Bloodrayne game yet and that's coming from a huge fan of the original two Bloodrayne games.Simply put, this game kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Then cuts off it's limbs and sucks the blood out of the remaining torso before carelessly tossing it aside to move onto the next victim. Rayne herself would be proud. Highly Recommended!"

The game eats inputs. For a platforming game that eats your jump inputs when holding right half the time is unacceptable and becomes completely unplayable towards the end of the game when timing multiple jumps becomes necessary to complete the level. For the first half missing a jump isnt the end of the world, but still can be frustrating.Second major issue is hitbox detection. Getting hit by things not touching your characters image, being able to stand half into spinning saws without being hurt, falling through platforms that you jump on, or even taking spike damage from the top edge of the platform, but not the spike part you can jump off of...Third some of the abilities/moves not intuitive. The game also does not say a controller is recommended. I would argue its STRONGLY recommended. I may purchase on psn to see if using a controller solves this.  Now doing a high jump involves running, releasing ALL keys, then pushing jump, but only if Rayne is sliding, if she just comes to a stop she will only do a regular jump. This mechanic is balls.Lastly, I love the concept, music and its fun once you get used to the controls even on keyboard. It pains me to not recommend the game, but with the game eating your jump command, and it being necessary to do many timed jumps in succession to complete some levels, I just cant in good faith tell people to pay money for this. If they patch the game I could see this being a thumbs up, 9/10 or 10/10 Please buy now review."

It's a huge departure from it's original series, but for all the right reasons. The action is precise, responsive, and deep. You can button mash, but it will only take you so far. At a certain point of the game, it becomes a lot more demanding, and knowing your move set properly will be required. The game looks gorgeous, and the soundtrack compliment the action. A strong entry to the brawler genre.Positives:- Fast, responsive combat.- Unique ""all offense"" mechanics.- Very good looking.- Great soundtrack.- Explodes with badassery.Negatives:- The menu looks generic.- Might be too hard for some."

I love a good 2-D hack & slash game and BloodRayne Betrayal really does rock when it comes to this genre.I'm only an hour or two into the game so I can't write a full-fledged review on it yet but I imagine that I am going to be wanting more once I finish the game, it's just damn good (the music is awesome, there's lot of GORE! and who doesn't like plenty of gore? a wide variety of moves to deal damage to your enemies, bloodsucking vampire goodness (and not that baby vampire crap either!)."

That much is clear enough from the store description, but I'll say this: Learn your combos.This was originally released for consoles some years ago, so a controller is the best fit for this title. I highly recommend this game for (as others have noted) an inspired and modern take on the Castlevania genre - there's a sharp learning curve to successful runs, but it's well worth it.As a bonus, you can check out the full soundtrack by Jake Kaufmanherefor free. It alone justifies the price of admission!"

,Not Recommended,281220,22485355,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,SimonM7,"If I made a list of things I think constitute bad video game controls, almost everything about BloodRayne Betrayal's controls would be on it. Confronted with every option of doing something to make the game flowing and fun, or making it feel numb and clunky, they seem to have opted for the latter.It doesn't matter starting out. The game is gorgeous and has a modestly budgeted feel that makes it quite easy to forgive and even like initially. More maneuvers are introduced before long, and although it wears thin eventually, you have a decent amount of combat options to mix things up and express yourself with that stuff.But when they take what is a fairly functional 2D brawler and apply it to platforming sections, it just turns into a miserable experience. Not miserable because it's impossible - it's not - miserable because there's absolutely nothing fun or stimulating about the arbitrary gameplay segments they force on you. They are just a chore. If you simply describe those sections to somebody - that you're asked to bounce on enemies to keep afloat while fighting other enemies - it sounds challenging and fun because you imagine that the controls are suitably responsive, but boy they sure aren't.Truth is I really wanted to like this. It looks really, really cool and it's a fun and clever use of the license. There are plenty of moments when it's easy enough to gloss over its issues and enjoy, but when you first pick it up, the game immediately feels less snappy and responsive than you want a game like this to feel, and before it's over it asks you to perform precision movement that make its shortcomings impossible to ignore."

The game plays like a budget Castlevania, which sounds great as a concept, but the unbelievably stiff controls keep me from saying the game is ""good"".  Every movement and attack feels stilted and slippery, and as the game throws more and more death traps at you it's not something you adapt to; it's just bad.   It's certainly a challenge, but it's much more a test of patience and willingness to put up with frustration than a test of skill or memorization.  The soundtrack is pure generic butt rock that's just cheesy enough to be enjoyable, though it could use a few more tracks.  Overall Bloodrayne Betrayal is forgettable aside from the fact that I somehow powered my way through it.  Don't bother unless you've mastered the hundreds of better platformers that are available and you kind of hate yourself."
,Recommended,281220,9988575,"Posted: 1 May, 2014",all,epilis,"This is a 2D sidescrolling game that can be compared to Castlevania 1/3 on the NES. A controller is highly suggested for this.This seems to be a perfect port from consoles as I own it on PS3 and have beaten it several times. I was very glad they brought it to Steam. It's nice to see the game up close and that's always enjoyable. The controls for this game may not seem responsive, but they are. It's not like Strider where you can press attack repeatedly and get results. Think of it more like the response of controlling a character from a fighting game. You'll have to learn the difference on how to execute a toe-tap vs a down-stomp after jumping. Once you launch an enemy in to the air, you can either jump up and pound on them, or you can send them flying. You have all the basic moves from the beginning, so you won't have to worry about learning them as you progress. There are, however, a couple of powers you do acquire later on in the game.I've seen a couple reviews for this game on major gaming sites and they are overly harsh. This stems mostly from complaining about the difficulty. I can tell you right now that this isn't anywhere near as difficult as a lot of other games out there. At the same time, I can say that it'll only be easier while being enjoyable if you learn how to properly control BloodRayne.The graphic style goes perfect with this game. The music is superb. The brain behind the music is Jake Kaufman. I highly recommend you google for him. The options screen has just about enough video options due to this being a 2D game. You only have resolution size, windowed/borderless/full screen, and vsync.I highly recommend this game to anyone that's a fan of 2D side scrolling games."

Bloodrayne as a character is cool and she's overdue for a new proper game. But not like this. If you like these kinds of games (which i do btw), and don't mind the awkward jumping mechanics, the lack of a duck feature (because you know how much dhampirs can't duck) the pointless bird sections of the game and the difficulty of the game and the lack of options.. then yeah get it.. for cheap because it's not worth 10 dollars. i paid 2 for it and that was fair.

,Not Recommended,281220,23301438,"Posted: 30 May, 2016",all,Ali Kharazi,"I really enjoyed BloodRayne 1 and 2. They had fun over the top action, a decent storyline, and generally good graphics for their time.  BloodRayne (along with Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines) may very well be the best in this very small genre of vampire video games. I had seen the mixed reviews for BloodRayne: Betrayal on Steam and elsewhere, but being a fan of the franchise, I decided to check it out anyway.Unfortunately, much of the criticism is well-founded. The two major criticisms of the game were its controls, and its unbalanced difficulty. The controls are not as responsive as you’d expect in a 2D platformer. You’ll often find yourself positioning yourself at just the right location to suck an enemy’s blood, or finding just the right timing to execute certain basic attacks. Now about the difficulty, I’m not usually one to complain if a game is too hard. Although the game has a higher than normal level of difficulty throughout, every once in a while you’ll reach a level that is just so ridiculous, that you may question whether it’s really worth your time trying to beat it considering that the game isn’t that good in the first place anyway. These two criticisms are unfortunate, because I think that had the controls been more responsive and the difficulty more balanced this may have turned out to be a great addition to the BloodRayne series.If you were a fan of the first two games like me, you will probably pick this up anyway in which case I’d recommend waiting for a sale. If you are new to the BloodRayne franchise, I would recommend passing on BloodRayne: Betrayal and picking up BloodRayne 1 and 2 instead."

76561197992229015,Not Recommended,281220,15621448,"Posted: 30 April, 2015",all,Dire,"This is a game you'll either love or hate. I, I rather hate it.Pros:- Cool art style- Gore- Blood sucking- Enemy variety is ok- Boss fights are kinda coolYea. That's about it.Cons:- No difficulty setting- Bad controls- No story- Boring gameplay- Platforming is extremely annoying- Not much original content- Insta deathsThis game is only 10 dollars, so for that price I can kinda almost recommend it, but I won't, because I feel it's an extremely lazy attempt at a video game. The start of the game feels ok, the combat is more or less enjoyable at first, but after the first few levels it gets extremely repetitive. You will be presented with quite a few different enemies over the course of the game, some of them bosses. Those fights are somewhat cool, though you can feel overwhelmed by what is going on on the screen at first. You literally only have 2 attacks. Press X for melee combos and RT for a gun shot. You have limited ammo, but there are usually enough drops. You can also bite other vampires and either suck their blood for health (which I found extremely necessary and which makes you invulnerable for the duration) or infect them and detonate them with Y. That's about all you get with the combat. You can also jump and dash through most attacks, which is also required to survive.Let's just say this game is not for casuals. I'm not bad at brawlers, but this one is just boring, because all combos are simply ""press x"". You can vary things up with the direction pad, but that's it. And at times you even need to to solve a ""puzzle"" (juggle an enemy and launch him into a grinder for example). I find it extremely boring. What's worse is that you can't dash out of a combo, meaning you mash the x button to kill enemies, but you can easily get hit by another attack, because your character does not accept the dash command while hitting someone, instead of cancelling the attack or transitioning to the dash action. Combine this with the fact that you fall to the ground when you get hit and that you can die really easily once you're on the ground since there does not seem to be any ""quick get up"" mechanic (or I've missed it) and you can quickly lose a battle against multiple foes.The save points are also weirdly positioned. Often they are ok, but sometimes you have to complete a difficult fight and then complete an even more difficult platforming section or the other way around. And when you die, it's back to last checkpoint. That can be quite frustrating. That being said I am not at level 12 or 13 (of 15 I think), so you will get through sooner or later if you're not a hopeless case, but the amount of unncecessary frustration is high.Platforming: Whoever designed the controls for this game needs to be punished. They are unprecise and the required backflip is executed by first running in one direction, quickly turning and pressing the jump button. This is infuriating throughout the game, because not only do you need some space to do this properly, you also need to judge where you will land. It is even a required mechanic during a boss fight, which can screw you over hard. You can also wall jump and dash in midair.Later on there is also Flappy Bird in the game. Great. Just what I was looking for.Oh and let's not forget the poison. The ♥♥♥♥ing poison, which kills you instantly and sends you back several minutes.The art style looks pretty at first, but it gets so boring after a while, because you're only in this one big castle, going down, then up, then down again...the setting never really changes.The story is presented in boring chat bubbles in game...the little there is of it. Meh. Forgettable. You can't skip that♥♥♥♥♥♥either, so if you die at some point it can happen that you have to watch the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""cutscenes"" over and over again.How one is supposed to get a good score in the game is beyond me. It rates you at the end of the level. I have never even come close to even getting one extra point for time or health. I dunno. I'm apparently just ""worm chow"", yet worm chow can apparently beat the game. Meh.There are also skulls to collect. You can upgrade health or ammo with them. Most of them I didn't even find, some I didn't try to reach, because the risk reward system is severely misjudged.Conclusion: If you love Bloodrayne and 2D Brawlers and want a quick fix you may want to get this. Everyone else should stay clear...it's not expensive, but it's also not very good."
,Recommended,281220,22340316,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,Unpageable,"If you are familiar with the Bloodrayne series, then I must first warn you that it plays nothing like the previous games, an open mind is required should you decide to purchase. This is a challenging platform brawler that has 15 stages in total, not a Metroidvania with free roam. You can obtain secret skulls that can extend your life bar or bullet count, but you won’t unlock new move sets or level up.In terms ofgraphics, I feel the screenshots didn’t do it much justice. While it may look like a flash game in still frames, the animation is extremely smooth and pleasant to look at. The stage backdrops are detailed and befitting in most cases, while the blood splatters never gets old. I do have some gripes on the lack of variety though, as every single enemy of the same type will look the same every time, not even a colour swap, this was just plain lazy.Contrary to popular belief, thecontrolsare fine; they just require very precise timing to pull off properly. I managed to complete the game using a keyboard, while countless speed runners did it on Youtube with various controllers. This is a case of casual gamers spoiled by handholding mechanics, blaming the controls when they just need to git gud.Musicis where this game really shined, every track was pumped full of adrenaline and atmospheric, the ending song ""Cursed Dawn"" was especially memorable. Sound effects are numerous but very distinctive from one another, I can perfectly tell what was happening amidst the chaos just by listening alone. The game even came with a whole set of 8-bit soundtracks as an Easter egg, so it is virtually impossible to complain in this criteria.The only downside to this game came from thelevel design, which is admittedly a little repetitive. There were too many spike, acid and cannon ball traps laden across later stages; almost to the point of annoyance. The difficulty scale is mostly justified in lieu with the game’s progression, but the 13th stage was just completely evil and totally uncalled for. It got a lot of people to rage quit at that point which I can relate with. Whoever designed that stage was just sadistic.In conclusion I feel I must recommend this title to anyone who’s up for a challenge, it is very underrated and often blamed for the wrong reasons. It may not be a canon entry to the series, but it has enough merits to stand on its own."

The difficulty spike is tremendous and most of the time you'll eat insurmountable damage without technically doing anything wrong due to half a dozen enemies swarming you at the same time and hitboxes being totally off the charts. Sometimes you will get hit by things miles away from your character model, sometimes you can literally stand in spikes or sunlight without getting any damage whatsoever.Atmospherically it is brilliant, it is gory, animations are limited but look great, the soundtrack is good, but I can't recommend the gameplay at all due to the abysmally bad control layout and mindbogglingly unintuitive movement and jump mechanics, which makes this a non-recommendation for a game that lives entirely off its combat and platforming.

And for some reason, it works so well to the point it might be even better than the actual BloodRayne games that came out years ago. BloodRayne Betrayal is not for the casual gamer, with its all balls-out approach to platform difficulty, you would have a frustrating time just trying to get a better score in each level and the action comes fast and hard. Very quickly, to the point that Dark Souls almost looks kind in some respect. This is truly a homage to the platform games of old like Castlevania, which seems to be the main inspiration here.The soundtrack is lovely. There's no voice-acting but the music is exciting and really gets you pumping as you get killing through each level of the game. Graphics are nice and controls seem to work fine. Fine, but not a 100% perfect. BloodRayne looks hot, as usual and she has all kinds of ways to kill the numerous types of enemies that come her way. There's not much of a story here which probably won't do much anyway as you'll be literally killing non-stop.If you're one for the difficult platform games of old, then this would be a good buy. If you're not the type that can withstand the frustration of getting hit and killed over and over again, then stay away at all cost. It'll take everything from your hand-eye coordination and memory of combos to get the work done."

The core gameplay is there and is fun, as are the graphics and sound. The game plays very similar to pre-SotN Castlevania, which is great.The problems with the game boil down to the controls and difficulty, which are in some ways two sides of the same coin. The game is almost ruined by some of the downright unfair and cheap segments later in the game, which are made worse by the not-100%-responsive controls.The story also leaves a lot to be desired. I wasn't necessarily expecting anything that great from this game in this regard, but it ends way too abruptly and I feel the game should have at least another four or five levels of content. It's like they cut off the last quarter of this game - final boss and all. The game is also laughably short, even for a 2D platformer (I beat it in three hours on my first try at the game). This could've also been fixed with a few more levels added.Overall, this game is good, but leaves a lot to be desired.

The controls were awful for a side scroll beat'em up. The bosses (I only played to the second one) were just a reskin, same badguy with a weird if you fall off me you don't reach the end of this bottomless pit I just suck you up and spit you above me so you can kill feature. Yet as soon as you kill it you reach the bottom. Anyway back to the reskin, the first time I fought it I though hmm thats annoying but interesting. its added in 4 little targets I have to hit not just smash its face like everything else. The second boss they are like 2 minutes before hey use this random skill you've had but we never told you about to open this one wall. Now boss time! Same exact boss but they made it so you have to use that one pesky skill to break open its weak points, and since that would be too simple lets just throw hordes at you while you do it.Even that I could have lived with but the kicker of why I'll never play this again is the backflip. Apparently a double jump feature is just so over done they had to add in a backflip. Logically you just have to push a button to do it right? wrong you have to make her run one direction then quickly turn and run the other way to make her slide then hit the jump button and she will backflip. Now the first couple times its annoying but doable at the later stages when you have to do it on small platforming sections I found it near impossible to complete both on controller and keyboard.Oh and if you want you can mario stomp enemies because your highheels will kill them, and there are sections of using that to kill your way up long drops which I found pointless especially since you had to time a attack as you landed on them rather than just let it land on them.The gun I have so far I don't know about the whole game but atleast upto where I quit is a 5 shot pistol that damn near 1 shots everything in a line.

My first impression of the game was that levels looked beautiful and the comic book style graphics were charming. As the game progressed I noticed that new enemies became less and less frequent and i was just mulching over the same ones over and over. The story. Well there is bascially no story. its basically just banter and pointless conversation between three characters (unless i missed something). The gameplay. In the beginning its enjoyable but as the game progresses the stages get harder and the enemy hordes get bigger. as the hordes get bigger and the stages get harder, accurate controls and staying mobile while fighting becomes neccessary. This game delivers neither. your forced to play through incredibly hard levels with irresponsive controls and a gimped combat system. to make matters worse,checkpoints become less frequent which means if you die you get sent WAYYY back.Overall this was a game I felt had alot of potential.

You start an attack, see the enemy attacking, want to cancel an attack into dodge - uh-uh, you can't do that until animation has finished.

It is a disapointment to bloodrayne fans.    basicley this is a side scrolling  game with absolutley no  voice acting whatsoever  .

I think the developers ran out of time and/or funding to properly finish the game which would explain some frustrating gameplay elements and an overall weak story progression and endgame. Because on one hand, you have a game has really good animation, great atmosphere and an awesome soundtrack. BloodRayne Betrayal has some heart to it as well with its attention to detail and its ability to expand the BloodRayne lore. Heck, there's even a code that allows you to switch out the soundtrack to an 8-bit one!On the other hand though, the controls and the combat definitely needed some more polish. Don't get me wrong, the game is a compentent and fun 2D brawler, but sadly, it is not the type that is easy to learn and hard to master. Sometimes, you try your best to survive the wave of enemies with great combos and no damage taken, but often the clunky execution of controls and enemy targeting make it impossible to do so. This is especially frustrating when it comes to platforming: you truly need some patience to get through some of the later chapters.For the most time, however, the game works and it makes you feel awesome in the boots of Rayne. When the metal songs start to play, and your coffin rocket hits the ground, you kick out its door to slam nearby enemies. That moment right there encapsulates the essence of BloodRayne Betrayal, but I wish that feeling would have lasted way longer.If you enjoyed games like the Shank series, do give it a try, you won't be disappointed. This is a recommendation even at its full price."

It is the atmosphere that attracts me most, and it lets one forgive unimpressive graphics and stagnant storyline. It is worth mentioning that Jake Kaufman made a true feat, and the NES version is pure art. You can feel the influence of Scriabin in the final boss soundtrack. That piece of awesome music deserves to be transcribed as a concert étude for piano solo.P.S. You may consider me insane or even impale me for the following statement, but Bloodrayne Betrayal is not difficult in any way and the controls are OK.

But I honestly wouldn't recommend it to people who aren't majorly in to hack and slash games or want to play a more casual game. Since there are some annoyances which I think takes away some of the enjoyment of the game.For example, the difficulty can vary greatly. At one point I was strolling through a level without having any problems with the combat or the platforming, that suddenly changed when I came to a bunch of platforms that I had to jump across, those platforms would disappear if I stayed on them for too long. If I fell down from the platforms I would end up in acid which would kill me in one hit and I would have to start over from a checkpoint. There was also missiles flying around in random patterns, as well as enemies who would throw bombs at me. Since the platforms were so small, I would fall to my death if I ended up getting hit by a missile or a bomb.This required way more skill and luck than what was previously required of me. Varying difficulty can be a great thing, but I don't think it's so great when it happens in the middle of a level.The combat itself isn't really hard, in fact it's pretty easy and the enemies only do a few types of attack with little variance. However, the game with often require you to be very precise with your actions and will also often feel unresponsive when you try and do certain actions. You get knocked to the ground extremely easy. The weakest attack will knock you down if you're mid-air. Enemies will often hit you while you're getting up from the ground, which will cause you to get knocked down again.It is also sometimes very very hard to tell things apart, especially what's in the background and foreground. This is espeically prominent in chapter 15.But besides that, it's a great game. It's easily worth 10€ and really enjoyable if you're able to look past those things I listed."

I'd really like to meet the guy who decided that this game's stupid backflipping maneuver was a better idea than implementing a simple double-jump. It's probably the same guy who put in a completely useless dodge. Adding to my consternation is the fact that the most basic peon enemies take about a dozen hits to kill, and literally everything in this game has higher attack priority than you. So enjoy getting those flashy combos interrupted nonstop while you're trying to rack up that completely arbitrary score. Not that it particularly matters, since it seems like pressing the attack button gets the game to roll at random from a large list of offensive movements, each with different hitboxes.

It relies in a ability you need to press back, forward and then jump to execute higher jumps (and she goes the other way). For example, if you want to execute a highter forward jump, you need to press back and forward buttons very fast (she will slide) then you press the jump button. It's pretty dumb when you need to execute a precise forward jump and you have to press the back button...The soundtrack of the two levels I played was also repetitive. I was thinking to myself I had to play at least 1 hour to give a decent review but I could not stand being surrounded by the same enemies all the times in a repetitive manner.TLDR; Repetitive enemies, repetitive soundtrack, bad platforming mechanics."

Sure it's not their best work, but it's still at a high quality that Wayforward is known for.What really blows it for this game is the gameplay. Initially, the combat is satisfying once you know what you're doing and performing acrobatic stunts is pretty fun too. But as the game goes on, the platforming gets to the point where it just feels cheep and the combat gets too hectic. Several times did I find myself dying, not through fault of my own but because of the controls. Several times did I lose Rayne in a crowd of Vamps because the action became too cluttered and messy.And it's a shame since there are plenty of elements that are enjoyable still, but ultimately those parts aren't necessarily worth the frustration. It's a pretty brief game too, with little replay value I feel. If it were priced better then i'd say it'd certainly be at least worth a shot (this is a case of, if you see it on sale, i'd say maybe give it a look), but as it is, it's just a pain in the neck."

A fun sidescroller with new-age retro graphics that make the game look nice. It surprisingly controls really well, nice and tight. The game is a good challenge however is somewhat short. It isn't the greatest game so its short length is actually fine. For a side scroller game like this, 5-6hrs is actually pretty long. The score system is pointless. The fact that after every single level the score system tells me I scored an ""F - Worm Chow"" is like a April fools joke. An F on every level because i didn't combo right or kill fast enough. lol who cares. Some of the later levels have god awful checkpointing and the last boss is frustrating but I still managed to finish the game in average time.Pretty good but not stellar.

You slide when you stop and go from stop to run with no speed inbetween. While this is bad design, it's worse considering there are platforming sections.There is practically no story.The game is so bad, that it led to the cancellation of 2 other Bloodrayne games that were in development."
76561198215019496,Not Recommended,281220,22496917,"Posted: 18 April, 2016",all,JustJack6,"I liked the Bloodrayne games not for the frankly pathetic sexuality they wedged into the titular character (hehe, &quot♥♥♥♥♥quot;ular) but for it's gameplay. I was well aware the gameplay was going to be drastically different in this, I just wanted to make that clear.Now while the art style is nice, the soundtrack works well enough and even the bulk of the gameplay is efficient and satisfying... there still remains a few flaws and gameplay elements I've recently grown to detest. Let's start with the actual flaws before I rant about how insecure I am.1) The platforming; it's a'ight. The problem is that it has to be uber-precise. There's some weird hit detection going on. Not with the enemies but with these spiky platforms you've gotta jump up. There are no spikes on the side and it's difficult to get a direct landing on top with the er, unconventional controls. So you end up doing a little wall graze and jumping up- well, at least you try to. Instead Rayne must jam her foot into one of the spikes as a form of self punishment for not doing it right and so you just do an old-school Ouch-that-hurt-flop on to the platform. Kinda frustrating.2) The contoller input; starts off a'ight but gets frustrating quick. The game only processes one button press at a time, meaning when you push a button you have to watch Rayne do the full animation before you do anything else. Not a madly common problem nor would it be a gamebreaker alone but it really ruins the fluidity of the gameplay and can sometimes, ironically, betray you in combat. Unless of course you know exactly how to do everything and do it well. The most frustrating thing for me was trying to feed. You have to hit someone/thing and stun them before you can feed but if if you're too close or late you have to watch Rayne grab at thin air and then get royally fisted. Also there were one or two occasions where mo'♥♥♥♥ers would basically juggle me. There doesn't seem to be a get-up attack which I think would do wonders at times.Both of those flaws can be overcome if you're really good at the game but the fact that you have to suffer through such punishment so early on, for me, is a deep flaw in gameplay.Now most of what's stopping me play it is that other thing: ranking systems and hidden collectables!I'm hating these things more and more recently. I don't mind not so hidden collectables like the orbs in ENSLAVED or ones that just unlock extras. That's fine but but if they do nothing; pointless and if they upgrade the character it becomes a double punishment. Not being good early on can make it more difficult for you later. And some of them are not just hidden but require you to perform very specific acrobatics in order to get them. That's just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥And then you've got the ranking system... why do games like to remind everyone they're terrible? It's demoralizing. When the game calls me a cadaver and ranks me a solid F it just makes me think ""well if you're gonna be like that I won't bother with you anymore"". Kinda like my last relationship.Now I could easily get much further into the game than I am but I probably couldn't do it to the games high standards and so, I'll just stick to Mark of the Ninja for my animated, side-scroller hack'n'slash needs and Rayman Origins for the platforming. Get in on sale if you must, it might be right for you if the above things don't bother you much."

The play style changed from Tomb Raider esc to Castlevania esc.  That's fine to.  But everything just feels cheapened.  The animation at the title screen even looks like it was pulled out of those flash games that get put together by 1 person for giggles.  The tutorial is lacking, heck watching the intro video teaches you more about what your character can do than the tutorial itself does.  The controls seem very sluggish as Rayne is dedicated to any individual move you make until the animation is complete.

But I will go into detail and pretty much say what every other negative review has said so far (BTW this is my first negative review ever)The ProsThis game looks great. I love the art style. I hope the art department gets the $1 I spent on this game because they are the only ones in the company that deserve any money for this thing.The ConsPretty much everything else, but let me go into detail.-The biggest one, the controls. They are completly useless, and don't fool yourself this isn't a simple remapping problem solved kinda thing. The way they are divided between keys and how they interact is the issue.-The backflip, what can I say it looks nice. Who ever came up with the mechanic for it tho you should of fired on the spot. Sprint, change direction and jump. Ok ok that really not so bad, but the overly long and overly complex (complex for the controls not complex for a sidescrolling game) platforming parts its a nightmare to pull off and is punished serverly.-The combat at first seems kinda nice, slashing everywhere and blood and all. Then 2 min after the first fight and ur fighting mobs on boths sides you realise it only registers one key press at a time. Which then leads to the next problem.-Your gonna get hit. which is fine. But the knock down and getting up animation is so slow I might as well get up and get myself a drink in the time it takes to completly which then causes enemies to juggle you around a fair bit. Which leads me to the next point (getting good at these segways tho)-The enemies. I think there are like 6 in total or something like that. Not even 6 types with varying skins. Nope flat out cut and paste 6 types. Most of which make no sence. A weird toad thing, A rocket knife? wtf? (and more segwaying)-There is no story to this at all. Not even a hint of way. Space invaders has more of a story to it than is. Yet magiclly having no storyline at all they manage to still make it not fit in with any of the bloodrayne story. Oh shes working with Brimstone? wonder if they are going to explain why she is after the events of the 2nd game - Nope, Oh shes fighting Kagan her father again? Wonder if they are going to explain how he is still alive after being decapitated in the 2nd - nope. Wait maybe this is before all that (ignoring that there are rockets and lasers)? Nope you kill him at the end. I would say thats a spoiler but you will probably stop playing this 50% of the way into it.TL;DR - If you like playing a platformer with broken controls thats 80% luck based then you have hit a gold mine with this game. If you were looking for a sidescroller hack and slash game that added to the Bloodrayne storyline then its a completly waste of time."

Whoever designed and coded controls, and designed levels that require these 2 tricks to advance forward just ruined the game. Im not sure if game gets any better later and dont want to play anymore, i dont see right now any adventure platforming, Castelvania or Shantae (from same developer) or Duck Tales like element, only endless and quite boring and repetive slashing or same enemies. Even Double Dragon Neon (from same developer again) has more variable enemies and more interesting combat, here i just press X all the time.Also, i dislike lack of respect to original lore and style of Blood Rayne 1-2, this game ruins cannons of series, betrays it and pretty much turns it into Hellsing anime with Blood Rayne almost complete lack of story. Music also dont match style of original game - they changed electronic industrial and dark ambient for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ repetive anime-kind-of-intro-sequence-j-rock with very short and repetive cue that makes my ears bleed. Indeed its a Betrayal of Blood Rayne and probably WORST game of WayForward i ever player. Usually i like their games, and usually they do it right with third party franchises like Duck Tales and Double Dragon Neon, but not this time."

I played this game for five minutes and I was instantly addicted! I love that the artwork is in anime form and it has a really cool soundtrack too.

Then this might be for you. Assuming you have a controller. The control of the game feels decent though even though you understand some of the sliding backflips it seems to be weird to get the hang of it. I don't know what the deal is with it. It might be based on the game never meant to really be used with a xbox style controller with thumb stick. Maybe it'd be better to perform certain skills with a more arcade style thumb pad.Either way it's decent overall but probably not something you will want to rush to play daily. It is most like a game meant for a retro horror game mood.
,Recommended,281220,19531433,"Posted: 6 December, 2015",all,Diabolical_Oblivion,"I would like to start out by saying that im not a big fan of the BloodRayne series, however, BloodRayne Betrayal was a breath of fresh air to me. I love the art style and animation and the background music. The soundtrack isnt very vast at all but still enjoy what is there.The combat is very hack and slash with some dashing and backflipping thrown in there and OH! bloodsucking, lots of drinking blood to recover any lost health. I have found myself still draining my enemies dry even when i was full health lol. You will find out that you are invincible while in the feeding process so I have used it to avoid being hit.Lastly instead of holding the button down to drink your enemies, you can just bite them to infect them and press another button to make them go BOOM!Onward to the bad part. Completion time. With just 15 short levels, I was able to finish the game in just under 5 hours. That was even with me going back to earlier levels over and over to find the hidden skulls that i missed. So I imagine a speed run would probably earn you maybe 2-3 hours of gameplay.This could be due to there budget for the game, I dunno. I will defend them a little by saying what is there, is good and challenging enough a times. Also the price point i believe is kind of high. I dont think you will get enough out of this game for 9.99My lasting impression - I love the Art style, Music, and gameplay. I strongly recommend purchasing this game when it goes on sale again. With a very short playthrough and leaving you wanting more, I feel that you should just save your $10 for something else. I purchased this game for .99cents during the holiday sales.For the price point, lack of voice acting, and short playthrough, I give this title an overall rating of 6.5/10I still recommend this game for when you can catch it on sale!"

It looks good and has a fantastic soundtrack. Platforming is fun too.Bloodrayne Betrayal is a fantastic game that features unique platforming and a deep combat system that will be familiar to fans of spectacle fighters, yet its 2D aesthetic makes it play like an old school fighting/beat 'em up game. It's a mesmerising and delightful combination.Rayne has a standard assortment of sword attacks that can be combined with launchers, sweeps and dashes to create combos. The dash movement is performed with a single button press and gives Rayne temporary invincibility, in addition to allowing her to get close to enemies to continue combos. It can even  be performed aerially, which allows for awesome combos.Naturally, she can suck blood from some enemies to restore her health and she can also infect them. This turns them into a living bomb which can be detonated. This is useful for crowd control and it's even possible to chain explode multiple enemies.Combat is the game's strong point. There's nothing more satisfying and exhilarating than combining all of these mechanics and become a whirlwind of blades, bullets, blood and explosions.Combat balance is excellent in that Rayne is very strong but her moves can easily be interrupted by enemies who themselves are quite damaging. Aerial control is quite robust. Each attack in the air staggers Rayne's rate of fall and it's possible to advance forwards and upwards as well. Aerial dashes can be mixed in to enhance mobility and combos, and you can jump off of enemies' heads to stay off the ground and avoid taking hits from damaging attacks.I enjoyed the platforming. Just like with the combat, you are given all the individual tools you need, and are then required to properly combine them.  One thing I appreciated was that the platforming and the combat feel integrated. You are able to use all the platforming mechanics in combat and you often have to! It doesn't feel like they're two separate things and as mentioned before, there are times when aerial attacks are required for the platforming sections because they stagger your rate of fall, elevate Rayne and move her horizontally.Visually, I generally liked the way things look. There's a Gothic, high-contrast art style that suits the game and movement animation is smooth. The soundtrack is killer and fits the game perfectly with its dramatic, orchestral score blended with heavy guitar riffs and solos.The story is unrelated to the previous two games and the game is linear. You'll play througheach stage and do not have the option to backtrack like in a Metroidvania game. You can select completed levels and replay them to improve your score or get any collectible Ancient Skulls you may of missed.Overall I found Bloodrayne Betrayal to be surprisingly excellent. It's a stylish, responsive and rewarding. The combat and platforming is challenging in an old school kind of way. The game expects you to pay attention, learn and adapt yet it's still generous enough with its checkpoints. I also enjoyed feeling in control of all the cool stuff that Rayne was doing. This is not the kind of game where you have to dial in QTEs for awesome things to happen.If you like 3D spectacle fighters like Devil May Cry, Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden, then you'll be at home with the game's combat system and difficulty. If you like 2D beat 'em ups and platformers, then you'll find a uniquely satisfying yet familiar experience. Just think of Bloodrayne Betrayal as a 2D spectacle fighter - a bloody good one!"

,Recommended,281220,14260085,"Posted: 31 January, 2015",all,Sarochi,"It feels like a wedding between classic NES games (I hear Castlevania brought up a lot, I agree with that comparison) and a more modern hack & slash style such as Devil May Cry translated in 2D. The combat system is simple yet robust, the platforming occasionally tricky but rewarding when you finally figure it all out and it’s all presented in a rather pleasing animation style.A few downsides are that combat encounters can feel rather repetitive due to a limited number of different enemies, and visually some backgrounds are a bit of a mess. The game also feels a bit inconsistent when it comes to story, as in it can’t seem to decide whether it wants to tell a story or it just wants to be about Rayne storming Kagan’s castle.Here’s hoping we haven’t seen the last of BloodRayne games in this style, or of the BloodRayne franchise in general. There’s definitely more potential for future games here."

As much as I enjoy the first two for their nostalgia, they aren't that great as games. The Bloodrayne games have never focused on story-telling and that tradition continues here.Betrayal is tough. The platforming is slippery. I wish there were more upgrade options than health and ammo. A weapon upgrade or even purchasable (by skulls) attack moves would have been awesome.My biggest knock against Betrayal is the lack of an actual dodge or parry system. I know that you can dash to avoid some hits, but it isn't efficient. The boss fights end up falling flat because of what your move-set is limited to.There are some real hair-pulling moments in platforming. There is a lot of trial and error."
