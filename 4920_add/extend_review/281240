I bought it hoping there would be some puzzles to work with, but there are very few puzzles, if they can be called that.I finished the first of 5 treasures within an hour, so I imagine the whole game will only take a few hours.  Some of the things that make the objects difficult are the scenes/colors of the object and knowing what their definition of the object is.  The trailer shows two of the ""puzzles,"" so if you do not want to get the answers spoiled, don't watch it!! Hopefully you read the comment before watching the video.The voice acting could be much better.  Unfortunately, there are weird pauses and it seems like the voice actors were just reading off the page and not so much acting.If you like the hidden object genre and don't care too much for the puzzles, this is a pretty good buy currently at $1.25.Note: I was playing on a touch screen, I didn't realize that if you hover the mouse around the scene, some objects will show a cog that you need to interact with and make this a lot easier."

Here, Susan is contacted by a mysterious man that will trigger a trip all around the world.Adventure Chronicles is belonging to what I call the early era of hidden objects games, in other words, where you're cleaning scenes by finding items on a list. So don't expect a game where you're roaming around and solving puzzles. However, the game adds some elements like items you need to dust/find in broken containers/behind burnable stuff. In other words, you'll have a lighter, an hammer and a brush to help you. Other items will need specific ones that will be used only in the scene. There is also a ""geocache"" object to discover, with a riddle describing it.While the game can be finished quickly, if you want a 100%, you're free to come back a second time in the scenes to find another list. It's a nice way to invite you to play it completely.However, keep in mind that some objects are little in size or so well hidden that you can't see them without a proper orientation of your screen. This is the main problem with these games from the first era and Adventure Chronicles doesn't escape from that.The backgrounds are correct and the soundtrack is also nice.That said, Adventure Chronicles, while I love it as I've played a retail version of it years ago, right now, in 2015, should mainly enjoy the hardcore fans - as the genre headed towards an adventure oriented mechanics and that new fans will be probably disappointed and be bored quickly."

I got this one on sale for 49 cents, and I guess it's worth that, but it's not really enjoyable.  (I made a new category in Steam called ""don't play again"".)It's difficult to see many of the items - not because I suck at spotting things, but because the graphics suck.  In some cases I end up clicking everywhere on the screen because I just cannot see what I'm supposed to be looking for.  (And there are some issues with what they call some things, but that's a minor issue.)Escape the Museum was more enjoyable."

I like the overall concept -- an Indiana Jones style trek across the globe in search of historic lost treasures. The music is nice, and the nerdy middle-aged female protaganist is an interesting character. Unfortunately there isn't much to the gameplay besides the hidden object scenes, and they are poorly done. Many of the scenes are low-res, dark, and muddy, and I could not see half of the hidden objects even when the item finder was hovering right on top of them. In fact without frequent use of the finder I would not have been able to complete the game at all, and to me it is a mark of a bad game when its core mechanic (in this case finding hidden objects) is broken. So although I appreciate what this game was trying to do, I must regretfully give it thumbs down."

The interaction has potential, but graphics are an essential part of a Hidden Object game, especialy if you're only showing partial objects or trying to blend them in with the background."
,Recommended,281240,12647451,"Posted: 26 October, 2014",all,giancarlo1985,This is a pretty easy hidden object game with rather basic graphics. For what it is... it's not bad. I bought it for $1.24 when it was 75% off. I wouldn't pay anymore than that to be honest. I do recommend a play if you can get it for cheap and like hidden object games.

I've even remarked that I would much prefer if the stuff I did end up finding, I could sell it all on ebay. In adventure chronicles that's exactly what happens. After you find the object you have found each object is given a market value suggesting that it can be sold. The only main problem with this, is that you can't do anything with that money. You can't decorate the museum, you can't buy clothes, you can't even buy weapons to blow your nemesis with a hidden agenda away. So again what's the point of finding the stuff you never need???Story is a big Yawn. You've been mailed a treasures hunters diary which contains the locations of 5 historical treasures on the false premise that the owner of that diary only wants a small percentage of the market value of the treasures found. If mundane objects like dominoes bring in $1,547 why even bother with the treasures?In the end the diabolical master mind who probably hasn't even learnt how to tie shoe laces yet, is thwarted by a trap that was so boring that i literally had to pound my head into the computer desk to get the circulation running back into my brain again.Thumbs up because it works, but believe me, there is BETTER hidden object games out there...https://youtu.be/HvYizV0SmTs"
,Recommended,281240,24519906,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,Bassem,"Hidden object game with some elements that enhance rather than detractWhat I enjoyedOldschool, pure HOG play, but with streamlined puzzles integrated in the scenes. (using found objects on the fly in order to unlock access to more objects.)A toolbox with items such as a dust brush and hammer that help you uncover more objects.A nice take on the ubiquitous HOG hint system - a metal detector-like item you move around your scene to scan for objects. The closer you get the faster it beeps. This also means you can just narrow down an object's location and then look for it yourself, so you can feel better about not (completely) relying on the hint system.Each location, once finished, allows you to return to it for more object hunting. This I think is better than what most games do - leave the extra hunting mode for when the whole game is finished.What I didn't likeOccasional obscure items (""density detector""?)Occasional obnoxious way to hide an object. Sometimes I find myself using the hint system and when the object is revealed I know there's no way I could have found it.A couple very difficult locations. Oldschool HOGs tended to really blend the items in the scenes, but this one goes overboard sometimes."

However, the images are barely clear enough to make out what you're looking for. I got annoyed rather quickly. Avoid unless at steep discount and only for hardcore HO fans. I will say I got my money's worth as I only paid about $1."

,Recommended,281240,23337247,"Posted: 1 June, 2016",all,shiaakuma,"This isn\'t a bad game as long as you realize that it\'s the older style of game.  By that,  I mean it\'s exclusively hidden object scenes held together by a tenuous plot.  If you enjoy HO scenes and aren\'t put off by the lack of flourishes that most modern games of this genre have in plenty, you\'ll probably like this.While I prefer the newer games with more plot, puzzles, achievements, and extras, I did enjoy this.  The addition of tools to help find certain items (an archaeology brush, a hammer, etc.) and some very minor inventory management added some variety.  When I say \""minor\"" however, I do mean that; the extent of inventory interaction doesn\'t go much farther than \""pick up a shovel and then dig a hole with it\"" sorts of things.Overall, with four hours of playtime (give or take, depending on if you go back to \""master\"" scenes) and at only $4.99, this is a decent buy for people that like old-school \""cluttered room\"" types of hidden object games."

(Sometimes up to 4 times in the original)It's not a great game, but it's enjoyable enough to keep you playing as you globe trot to locate famous treasures.The only negative I have is that the main character is supposedly an archaeologist and you spend most scenes destroying and desecrating historical artifacts in order to find the treasure!Overall. If you've played the terrible ""Escape the Museum"" and have been avoiding this game as a result, don't, it's safe!"

The poor graphics makes the HOG parts more of a pain than a pleasure. Since this is the entirety of the game, that's a big problem.Other than that, the story and the main character are not bad. Not good enough, however, to make me want to keep playing. I'm glad I bought it on a sale.

I've finished around half the game, and I'll be completing it for certain. The The HO scenes are the right level of fun to tough.The game does absolutely break all suspension of disbelief when you get your full set of usable tools though. The character's suggestions go pretty quickly from using a little brush to remove dirt to ""I wonder if I could break this?"" and ""This looks like it would burn easily."" Also, there's the concept of trying to keep the historical items safe for the museum while every item you pick up flashes a cash value.I bought this on sale, but don't recall the price, but it's worth checking out."
