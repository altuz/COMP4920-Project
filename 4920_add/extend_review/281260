,Not Recommended,281260,10671328,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,Uncle Sparticus,"First let me get this out of the way: I've played this for probably an hour, despite what steam's weird gametime tracking thing says. I've played it on a few different computers which is probably why it says I've played it for such a short time.Secondly: This is probably the second worst game I've gotten on Steam, the worst obviously being Air Control.In Desert Gunner, you're a guy manning a turret. In the desert. That's literally it. The ""multifacited levels"" the game description promises is really just one level where your convoy drives slowly in a straight line and you shoot at things.Unlike some of the great turret shooters out there (Beachhead 2002, lookin' at you buddy), in this one you'll have NO clue weather or not you're actually hitting anything. You fire and fire and fire and no visible damage or anything happens. Then your'e dead. Start the level over again. But when you start the level over again you won't be able to tell because the whole level is a straight line.You can switch between guns with the WASD keys, not that the game tells you that. Also, when you start the game up, the three green dots that are offscreen on the main menu are actually ""options"", ""credits"", and ""exit"" respectively. You simply won't be able to read them because the game, on all three computers I've tested it on, the game insists on running on a non-native, non supported resolution.I've tried it on a 4:3 monitor where it started in 16:9, and a 16:9 where it started in 4:3. No idea why that is, but worth noting: You won't be able to read half the main menu items.If you're a gun-nut such as myself, you might be interested in reading the technical specs the game has on all the weaponry you'll be using. You'll be significantly less interested when you find out that most of them are downright incorrect, and all of them are wirtten in text with font so small that you can't read them.All in all, don't waste your dollar. It's not even fun to laugh at like Air Control, it's just a mess. The developer put three seconds of effort into this, so you should treat them similarly."

,Not Recommended,281260,18404425,"Posted: 9 October, 2015",all,Trar [99th Calzones],"Desert Gunner is just a tepid pile of nothing, and that's even if you can run it correctly. It's entirely comprised of awful, repetitive turret sections where you shoot Iraqi soldiers while driving towards Baghdad - at least I assume they're soldiers. The game calls them insurgents, but most insurgents don't have a dozen tanks to throw at you during the average engagement.Gameplay-wise, aiming your weapons and firing is all you do. This isn't helped at all by the fact that aiming in this game sucks, there's practically no feedback that tells you where you're taking damage from so you can react in time, and the difficulty begins at ""brutal"" then shortly shoots up to ""you're not finishing the first level without cheats."" Your small convoy is swarmed with enemy armor, RPGs, and regular rifle-toting soldiers that can still somehow damage your tank's health. Imagine Kaizo Mario with AK47s and you're halfway to Desert Gunner.Meanwhile, the entire aesthetic is lo-fi and amateur to the point where it honestly looks like one ofHezbollah's propaganda FPSes. That was probably unintentional, given the player's entire justification for driving through the Arabian Desert is pretty much ""they're shootin' at you, kill 'em all!!!"" which isn't a good look for a game about one of the least justified wars in modern history.This isn't even a good bad game. Please avoid it."

76561197967787986,Not Recommended,281260,24799629,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,Pitdeadite,I'm a sucker for budget titles....so I figured I would drop the .50 cents that was required to purchase this game. It's an on rails shooter....which means that you have no control on where you are actually going....and it always results in you traveling in a straight line. But I'm getting ahead of myself here. First off....there is something seriously wrong with the start up screen. There is some sort of ripple effect streaming down from the top of the screen. I don't know exactly what it is....but it's a graphical error to say the least. Once you start up the game it disappears....and you are smack dab playing the role of an invisible soldier in a convoy. There is no tutorial....you just mow down whatever flashes red. There are different vehicles in your convoy....with an assorted array of weaponry. I didn't spend enough time in the game to see if I could switch between any of them....but I do know that when the vehicle you're in blows up....you do gain control of the next one. There is usually a health pickup lying in the road at some point....but that's all that is remotely noteworthy about the levels. The graphics are obviously nothing to write home about and the sound effects are nothing more than boom-boom and pew-pew. I played the game until I died for the first time (the third level)....and trust me....your .50 cents....would be better spent on a canned soda from a vending machine.
