I know the description says 'Single player', but rest assured THIS GAME SUPPORTS 4 PLAYERS SIMULTANEOUSLY (local) and 360 (also directinput) controllers work well.The game isn't splitscreen, all four players play on one game screen, like most party games. If you like Towerfall, SpeedRunners, Gang Beasts, Starwhal, Nidhogg, Samurai Gunn, then you should check out this game.Be sure to put in the only cheat code to unlock everything, to maxmize party time fun."

It's one of the best battle racing multiplayer games ever in my honest opinion. However, this is not 'Mashed: Fully Loaded'. This is the first game, 'Drive To Survive', which sadly, isn't nearly as good, with a pretty bad camera and a lot less content.I still recommend Mashed, but I am confused and saddened on why they chose to release this version instead of the greatly enhanced Fully Loaded version. It was a terrible decision and seriously makes me very sad.The game is still a pretty good racing game with weapons, and is still a ton of fun with friends, but seriously, releasing this version is like... well... think of it like if they released the original Devil May Cry 3 on steam instead of the special edition, and if the original had a bad camera and half the content of the special edition. Or if they released 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater' instead of 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence'.It's a terrible idea."

This game is what you're looking for.Mashed is a racing game where the main objective is towin other cars by distance or by destroying them. Each racing session is composed by rounds where each round gives/takes points depending on which place you've ended on the respective round, the first who gets its points bar full wins the racing session.

Nearly anyone (friends,family and even a Child can play) you can pick this up instantly and become a challenger the more players you have in game the more fun it becomes.It isnt all great though,there isnt any online/lan play, which is a huge shame, the graphics arent updated, yeah it isnt fully loaded but this actualy seems faster these days(maybe im getting old) they later released wrecked which had all the online  features i want for this but wrecked had lost its soul and this game has a bigger heart. its all core gameplay nothing else.the weapons in this youve see a dozen times elsewhere but they have a knack to them, the missle launcher causes soo much fun, you lock on, fire, watch it go, then if the other driver has skill will use it too hit another player, with the possibility of him crashing trying to do all of this at once.The chaingun seems just like a stress release as you fire the entire mag into an opponents backside just to set him on fire but use it on a corner or on an incoming bounching barrel and it all becomes clear, there are mines,a chaingun, missle, morter (my fave if your last) oil slick and even exploding bouncing barrelsI say hook this up to your big display/projector, get some beers,controllers, get some people to play and get wrecked sorry meant Mashed"

,Not Recommended,281280,17945560,"Posted: 8 September, 2015",all,Your Friendly Neighbor,"I own the original version of Mashed on CD and i can tell you it is not the same. It's like a totally different game. Cars have weird physics, ramps as not as they are on the CD version. In this version you either lose the momentum too fast and fall or the ramp edge flips the cars (or your car gets stuck on it). Whoever made this port clearly chopped up some of the main mechanics of the game up.On the Tierra Piedra (the only map in the Demo of this game as well), you can find the glitches described above, the ramp 80% of the time flips your car or makes it get stuck. Also the bridge that you can find the guided rocket collapses when you pick up the powerup (this should NOT happen) and your car blows up and falls.On Angel Peak i got a bug where the car would clip through the map and fall to infinity until you restarted the race. This was in the first 5 minutes of gameplay might i add.In total i think i spent about 100 hours into the original game, i don't know why. It was fun but it didn't have the bugs it has in this version."

I mean yeah, I can imagine this would make a great local co-op game, but how much you enjoy co-op games has less to do with the game itself and more to do with who you play with. But, seeing as I don't do local co-op, preferring online play, or just.. not doing it at my place at all, I rate it as I would any single-player game.Simply put, do you do local co-op at all? Then buy it at a discount, since I'm almost certain there are better local co-op games out there for the same price. If you don't do local co-op, don't bother. It's not the worst game in my library, but, there are too many design decisions and flaws that range from nitpicky, like the constant PG-13 taunting from enemy drivers, to ""why would they ever why"", such as the goddamn camera.I mean really, the camera might be the most formidable foe in this entire game, either artificially coercing the POV to display all of the racers as the track twists and turns (even in single-player) to follow the track and not your car, so you crash into walls and drive off cliffs, or straying so close to the ground that the field of view goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥and your own car obscures your view. You will get used to it, certainly, but it's just this unnecessary hurdle the game puts in your way, and it always seemed to find novel ways to ♥♥♥♥ with me as I progressed through the challenges.The moment I decided that forcing me through this game would be a waste of time, however, was when I was doing laps against 3 opponents, all of which were ahead of me. Two of them crashed into each other, hurdling each other off the cliff, but I didn't get to celebrate longer than two seconds, since they then proceeded to spawn one after another in my way and on top of me respectively, hurdlingmeoff the cliff.So, uh, no."

Don't worry about negative opinions here, on Steam. Some ramps are indeed bugged but most of them can be used without an accident by approaching through the middle with relatively high speed. Ramp on Terria Pierdra (not sure if I wrote it correctly) should be approached by the left side.Once again, I encourage everyone to buy it. It doesn't cost much but it's fun to play."

They have some really mind bending rules that keep the action happening.10/10... Ignore the crappy GFX, use your graphics cards control pannel to turn on AA and Anso filtering. Tripple buffering and Vsync will not work."

76561197999839135,Recommended,281280,21680275,"Posted: 6 March, 2016",all,PEET,"12 years later Mashed is still fun. A simple arcade racing game with a unique battle mode. Simply stay on the same screen as the leader or lose a point. It takes 8 points to win a match so it creates a great tug of war that can push both ways for an epic extended battle. Sometimes I won in a quick sweep fasion. Other times it swung back and forth for 15 min. The weapons, controls and camera make it feel like a tribute to the NES classic, RC Pro-am. The freeway battle level is amazing!My only major complaint is the lack of vehicle upgrades or other forms of progression. You simply unlock new tracks, modes and cups. Regardless of the short comings, if you like oldschool racing with weapons, Mashing has enough unique ideas and solid execution to make it  well worth the small price of admission."

It plays from an angled top-down perspective and everyone sees their cars on the same screen. You drive laps around the course and use whatever weapons at your disposal to take out the competition.Try it out, it's cheap!"
