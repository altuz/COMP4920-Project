A series of illogical, almost static point 'n' click one-screen 'puzzles' with jump scares heaped in. Click a candle, then some shoes, then a jumpscare, then look at a picture, another jumpscare, then some laughter and a jumpscare. If it had some semblance of plot or didn't feel like a game I could easily play for free online then it might be worth it's pricetag. The ExMortis series is available on flash gaming sites, is longer, better made and much more interesting. And also scarier."

I was adopted by an old turnip farmer, and he raised me as his own.  I thought that my life was going to be ruled by poverty, but one day, fortune struck.  An old laptop fell off the back of a truck. and it was mostly unharmed.  I knew what I was destined to do:  make Let's Plays of Minecraft and Spooky Games.  I started squatting in an abandoned house above a Starbucks, stealing internet from them and luckily, the old house still had power.I had hit a brick wall, though.  I didn't have any money, and I only had food and water from the farm, and from discarded pastries and half-caf diet iced caramel frothaccinos with cigarrette butts in them that people so carelessly left on the tables as they left the store, or went to the bathroom.After months of despair, today, yes today ladies and gentlemen, was the day I finally found a game I could afford.  For only nineteen cents, this game would launch my Let's Play career, and I would make millions of Youtube dollars.I fished a quarter out of a wishing well and ran as fast as I could to the farm.  I asked my adopted father if I could have the money from his Mastercard if I gave him the same amount in cold, hard cash, and when he said no, I just took his credit card and bought it anyway.  Don't worry, I put both the card and the quarter back in his wallet soon after.Ladies and gentlemen, today is the day I start my Let's Play career, and when the money I get from videos from this game starts rolling in, I'll finally be able to buy Minecraft and start making millions.Ladies and gentlemen...you're looking at the next PewDiePie."

Wow woopdee do not scary or interesting.This game is slightly scary, sometimes it will cause me to jump but most of the time not. I think I've been desensitised, hardly anything scares or repulses me anymore. The game description classes it as very creepy, I would not class it as very creepy.Has no story or plot to follow. It says Urban stories but Iam not sure what they are, you just have  some ghosts or such jump out at you and get some newspaper clipping covered in blood saying pregnant woman found butchered, killer unknown, it does not go into any story in detail. And there is no verbal narration at all.No wonder people rated it as a comedy as it's laughably not scary.Another reviewer sumarised it perfectly all this game is ""click on objects, wait for thing""Only buy if you like to add to your game collection and cards.1/10 unacceptable."
,Not Recommended,281370,14218000,"Posted: 28 January, 2015",all,virotti,"Serious review below (because joke reviews are not useful, but a waste of time):This is a supposedly enhanced version of a free web game, with more puzzles, better graphics than the original version and a clue system, that helps you if you are stuck for a very long time in one the game's levels. Want to demo the game on your browser? Try using google and you'll find it. The idea behind it is nice, but it is badly executed. Lack of clues to solve puzzles, one annoying puzzle that forces you to have great mouse control with lots of trial and error, a puzzle that requires you to memorize a word from a large text, etc.The game's sounds are good, but become very repetitive if you take too long to finish a room. There are some very weird and disgusting scenarios that fit the game well. The jump scares can frighten some people, but they are overused and predictable, with a B-horror, funny effect.I bought this because of the huge discount (75%) and because the game gives you cards, so I ended up paying a negligible price for the game after selling the 3 cards it gave me.Unless you want this game's cards, stick to the free version, which never got some annoying endgame puzzles."

After playing through it once, here are my thoughts.Its terrible, just terrible, not worth the few cents I paid for it. This game isn't scary, or fun.  ""Game play"" consists of clicking the screen randomly until something happens, which is usually a comically bad jumpscare. Not a grain of originality is present, it appears to be made completely of stock resources from the art assests to the sound design.The ""puzzles""make no sense and have solutions that are either so obvious they don't seem like solving a puzzle at all, or in the case of the 9 candles, require an obsure solution that the game doesn't hint at or indicate in any way. There is no plot. The game dev seems to think ""shocking"" images and excess fake gore are all you need to scare people.If you're looking for a short cheap fun jumpscare fest to talk your friends into playing try ""The House"" and its sequel , they function exactly the same as this game, only better. Plus they're free. No one should ever pay any ammount of money for this and I'm sorry I did."

And it actually does manage to scare, if you turn off all the lights, put on some headphones, turn the volume up real loud and don't tire too easily of some spooky face zooming suddenly up at you from the middle of the screen approximately every 2.5 minutes of gameplay (something which does admittedly seem to work on yours truly again and again and again, but then again, I honestly do believe one of the scariest moments in cinema history is that shot in the Exorcist of the guy with the painted face suddenly bursting onto screen...so I may be somewhat biased here).And the puzzles...oh, the puzzles...I especially loved the one where you have to write ""Belial"" in the tiled letters of a floor...everyone knows who Belial is, right? I personally just thought it was the ugly little round thing from Basket Case, but apparently he's also a world-famous demon...I really do need to read my bible more, apparently...Which brings me to the next, er, curious point about this game. If you read the Steam Store page, you'll be under the impression this is a game about ""urban myths"", and it does manage to keep up that particular thematic, more-or-less, for at least the first quarter or so of ""gameplay"" (note the inverted commas; they're not entirely accidental). But by the end we're seeing Popes on crosses in fiery barren landscapes, coaxing blood through lines carved into ancient Egyptian doors, and stabbing babies on altars just to see where the blood dribbles down to so we can solve the next puzzle. All ""urban myths"", apparently. I don't know about you, but nothing cries out ""urban"" more loudly to me than Egyptian tombs and desert landscapes.In all seriousness, this is probably a rival for the ""worst"" game I've ever played. Having said that, I still managed to enjoy it much, much more than many other games which are undeniably more aesthetically accomplished, not least of all on account of its stupidly short playing time and the generosity of the game-makers themselves in including a ""hints"" section which all but tells you exactly what to do. AND it only cost me twenty cents, on super-sale.If it ever gets down to that low, low price ever again, I'd actually recommend you buy it. It does have some really nice imagery, which you can make some pretty groovy screenshots out of. The only downside to this is, in order to get said screenshots, you may actually have to play the game.Verdict: 4/10 (for the pretty pictures and spooky sounds)."

,Not Recommended,281370,15362929,"Posted: 14 April, 2015",all,Fistfantastic,"If you're looking for anything associated with the game's title, do not so much as entertain the thought of purchasing this title. The words ""real"", ""horror"" and ""stories"" should not exist in the same sentence apart from ""this so-called 'horror' game was a real nightmare; the story of its critical mauling will be more entertaining than the product being reviewed!"".So what's the issue, besides not being a video game by any definition? Essentially the 'game' consists of 17 levels, each a single screen with interactive objects. Because the game thinks you're a malfunctioning automaton which can't think for itself, you can't express your excitement for this wonderful game by clicking crazily on the whopping ~3 items on screen; instead, you have to mash the left mouse button for each interactive object, and hope that you've done it right.The most disempowering I felt during this game was not when the game made a very weak - and predictable - attempt at a jumpscare, but when I didn't know what the Hell I was doing. Not knowing that I'd ""failed"" because I clicked an interactive object one too many times, or simply not understanding a puzzle because there's no context was a common issue in my experience. I had to resort to GameOre's walkthrough for around 6 of the rooms and even then they were not just vague, but completely inaccurate. Thankfully there's members of the community who had played further than I had so they could help, and for that they have my sympathies.But that's the gameplay in a nutshell - you click on things. I love point and click games and I could talk for hours about them, and ""you click on things"" would be the very least I could say. However this game just doesn't offer anything else, besides the reward of a jumpscare.So what stories are we talking about here? Urban legends? Creepypastas? Unsolved mysteries? Absolutely none of those. The game begins by discovering a haunted forest coming across past murder victims' ghosts, before that story is abandoned to tell another about our journey into Hell. It essentially goes from being a ghost story, which I found was the most terrifying part of the game, to a bad retelling of Dante's picnic in the underworld. Not only is it a bad story, or rather two stories that have absolutely no ties, it's horrendously told. No, it's not even that - there's no story being told. There's no narration, barely any text besides from the beginning, and you're just supposed to pretend that the previous level has something to do with the next.As for the horror I have to give some credit to the creepy scenery, as well as the quite scary images used for the jump scares. However the game relies entirely on those jump scares, and while I'm OK with them in moderation, this game lacks the talent to pull them off effectively. While I was shaken up because I'm a complete wuss, I won't dignify its cheap thrills by remembering them.All in all, this game offers absolutely nothing besides jump scares. There's no horror stories being told, and the definition of horror can be argued by people far better qualified than myself. The gameplay really is just ""click on object and wait for thing"", and it's a disgrace to both the point and click and horror genres. The day I forget this game exists can't come soon enough."

The graphics are lifelike, the voice acting evocative, the story engaging, and the gameplay meticulous. This stunning narrative will have you at the edge of your seats for many hours a day, many days a week, and many weeks a year. Shocking to say the least, the game's amazing replayability can largely be attributed to the stellar use of foreshadowing, irony, and other literary elements in the plot. This game compliments and exemplifies the great literary works throughout human history. As a whole, this first rate piece of media serves to parody the fears humanity has faced over the centuries. This cutting-edge work of art manages to juxtaposition fear and comedy; a feat that has, until now, never been done before in all of literary history. For years to come this masterpiece will be remembered among the likes of the works of Shakespeare, Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald, George Orwell, James Cameron, and Steven Spielberg. Added to these names will soon be GameORE: the accomplished developer of this literary masterpiece. I can imagine that, in the future, when we send deep-space probes to far away planets, we will include a digital copy of this game as a representative work of human cultural accomplishments."

Nothing can kill you and for some reason you carry on forward.The forumla eventually becomes over done quickly and you easily ready yourself for any jump scare because you'll learn the method from repetiton of gameplay.There is no story, So you wont know who you are, where you are going or why you have chosen to walk through this except for a few newspaper articles at the start of the game. which still dont reveal much or connect to scenes later on.The game can be finished within an hour, probably less and some scenes you can work out the puzzles within seconds or some puzzles are so cryptic that you'll be googling an answer ASAP. One puzzle even relies on a clue left in a previous scene that you cannot turn back and obtain.This game may be scary to some but it wont bother the most experinced of horror game veterans, it might scare off little children but I think its probably more suited for your grandmother who is currently dealing with a mid life crisis thing and wants to do something different with their life before they kick the bucket.

You get one or two hotspots per screen and you spam right and left mouse buttons at them constantly to brute force the rigid scripting that gets you to waste time backtracking and clicking on things in weird orders. This will trigger cheap jump scares of various kinds mostly centered around morbid apparitions and fast moving shades. Some of them were very weak like ... a crow flying. The game also has puzzle elements. Such as stiching back together a newspaper article. The bounds of the puzzle screens are not defined and it is easy to cancel the completion while in the middle of it by moving your cursor out of bounds, especially when shuffling pieces about. The pieces did not all align until they locked and when they did they sometimes superimposed each other which should not be happening. All in all this is a rather mediocre experience that clutters the library without bringing any fear or entertainment."

The issue isn't much of the use of still images, its the fact that puzzles are largely random clicking with no order or sense to them. I had a walkthrough open throughout the playthrough due to the random nature of it. It also over plays many jumpscares (if you call them that) most have a face like a microwaved Tony Blair, the only thing more used then jumpscares in Real Horror Stories is having some random shadow running passed the screen like you've downloaded a illegal movie online shot on a cam recorder, truly like some dude getting up for a♥♥♥♥♥♥halfway through.If you've ever wondered what hell would be like?

I actually scare pretty easily which is why i enjoy low budget horror clickers, but by the time i stopped playing i was almost asleep on my keyboard. The best part is, you don't even get to click to move.

The gameplay was overly simply, and very un-intuitive. The point and click mechanics would have been fine, if you had a visible reaction when you clicked. The game left me clicking on everything, unsure of what to do next, while giving no real hint as to the next move. Each move should naturally flow to the next, and in this the game failed completely. You shouldn't have to click repeatedly to make something happen, without any indication that you are clicking the proper things att he proper time. It is annoying and frustrating when you aren't sure just what the hell youshouldbe doing, and the game is giving you nothing to go on.B. The ""scares"" in this game were nothing more than cheap ""jump in your face"" shock value type scares, which leave nothing to the imagination, and definitely doesn't leave you wating more. Quite the opposite, in fact. After the 3rd level, I was already bored, and by the 8th, I was done,Seriously, nine candles and nothing else to clue you in on what you should do? Really? Of course you light them. And when nothing happens, then what? Spend all day lighting candles in various configurations until something happens? Not here. Give me a clue when I light a key candle, and I'll keep at it.

,Not Recommended,281370,18435708,"Posted: 11 October, 2015",all,Xenodermus (Drako),"Gotta put it out there, the scares are lame, but only because they are supported by a clumsily developed ""puzzle"" system. The entire thing makes no sense. There's no real premise to any of your actions. Nothing to indicate that what you're doing is actually making a difference, until you actually give the patience to just click on everything. There are two or three ""puzzles"" that are practically tests in patience as opposed to actual puzzles. One involves you to literally choose 4 out of 9 candles in a circle in the correct order. There is no indication that you click only 4 of these candles, there's no indication prior to this that hints to this being the solution. Thus, if you put it down to it, you would have to literally sit and test 1,000,000,000 combinations and for anyone to actually go out of their way to test that, I'd say that person is insane.Second is the ""Draw this shape with your blood""... there's a single path to take and if you make ONE mistake throughout the route, it's back to the start...I'm sorry, but this game just wasn't worth my time. Let alone that, the fact that the official webpage doesn't have walkthroughs to accomodate the changes to the game as well (and yes there were changes because I had to come to the Steam forums to find the puzzles that werent there)."

The element of 'horror' was implemented in a sub parr fashion, for example visually you were concenrating far too much on what the hell  you were trying to find to actually be 'scared'. The music was a nice touch, by the time you had noticed all of the other flaws in the game though you could consider it almost a redundant effort to claw back their own game.Overall it could have been better.
