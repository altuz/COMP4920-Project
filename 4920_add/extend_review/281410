,Recommended,281410,10329708,"Posted: 2 June, 2014",all,CookiesandBeer12,"I, like many people (I assume), first heard about this game from the guys at Inside Gaming. It looked interesting, I must admit, and when the price temporarily dropped down to $1.25, I knew I had to have it in my game library.This has got to be the one of the worst games I have ever played. To start with, for an FPS, the gunplay is surprisingly terrible. The guns have no real presence  and all of the sounds for them, from firing to reloading, are laughably stock. Each gun takes what feels like a year to reload (I'm sure you can see where that would get frustrating.) The graphics are extremely dated, even for a game that came out in 2008. It is also a Russian-made game. While this is not a bad thing, it does mean that it has had to be redubbed. The voice-overs are just unbearably atrocious. Everybody in it sounds uninterested in the current situation and when they should be yelling, they tend to do little more than talk in a high whisper. They are so bad that they make the acting in Just Cause 2 look like GTA V. The horrible voiceovers are not helped by the translated text, which so far has not had any spelling mistakes, but it is very convoluted to the point that you may need to reread certain sentences more than once.The AI is something to be studied and talked about for many, many years in the future. Oftentimes I have seen enemy soldiers run into walls and not turn around. If they are not running into walls, they are throwing grenades at the ceiling and blowing themselves up. If they are not trying to commit suicide, they are making a beeline for you so they can continuously whack you in the face. To make combat a little more interesting (or maybe to distract you from the awfulness of literally every single gun), the developers have put a few ""creative"" features into the game. If you are taking too many bullets from all sides, you can put up your ""UberShield"", which will absorb incoming rounds and deflect them back at your enemies. It also, unfortunately, does not let you shoot back at them, as it collects your rounds and fires them when the shield runs out. In addition to this, there are the ""UberSniper"" and ""Berzerker"" modes, which make you immune to damage after 3 headshots and 3 knife kills, respectively. While all of these features may sound very interesting, they are not implemented into the game very well at all, and half of the time they just feel like a retread of other features from previous first person shooters.The last thing I am going to talk about in this short essay of a review is the cutscenes. You remember cutscenes, don't you? The kind of ones that are either pre-rendered or made with the ingame engine? Well, if you don't like either of those, don't worry, Ubersoldier II has got you covered! Introducing the new and absolutely revolutionary comic-book cutscene! Watch as only 4 or 5 pictures are played continuously over bland dialogue. This has never been done in a game before, and I am sure that it is going to catch on with the AAA developers all over the world. (In all seriousness, the 4 or 5 pictures that they use in their cutscenes look hand-drawn, which at least took somebody some effort to make. Occasionally, they are drawn quite well, but not too often.)It may sound like I am taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game. It might not deserve it, but oh boy is it such an easy target. It is definitely one of the worst games I can think of that came out in the last decade, something on par with Ride to Hell: Retribution. There are a couple of major differences between these games, though. Ubersoldier II has got plenty of soul, and a hell of a lot of heart, while Ride to Hell is as cruel and heartless as the Devil himself. When I play Ubersoldier, I at least get the sense that there was a team of people actually TRYING to make a good game. You know what, I think they actually might have succeeded.In short: Is this a fun game?Hell yes!"

Like something that is just objectively not well made but is still for some reason incredibly enjoyable?  Ubersoldier II is like that.  It is so bad, so utterly horrible, so poorly made that it should never be played... but for some reason I loved nearly every second of it.This game is the ""Sharknado"" of video games.  It is bad in nearly every aspect but still a fun romp.  The voice acting is so bad, the story is almost completely nonsensical, the cutscenes are laughably awful.  This being said, everytime there is any kind of story exposition I can't help but crack a smile and just enjoy it.  The gunplay itself is pretty bland, not horrible but nothing amazing.  You get some special powers that spice things up a little and are really fun the first few times you use them but pretty quickly get stale.  The level design is so so so so bad that sometimes when I was playing through the game I would get stuck running around in circles while trying to complete a level and would end up screaming WHY????? when I finally figure out how to progress.  But even navigating these bizarre levels was kind of fun in their own way.  It was like exploring some kind of weird post modern work of art.Is this a good game?  Hell no.  Is this game worth playing?  Hell yes.  (maybe just get it when it's on sale)"
,Not Recommended,281410,12322430,"Posted: 1 October, 2014",all,Toxic League,"Ubersoldier II is pretty much another generic linear first person shooter. All the guns operate more or less the same. The movement is Uberclunky. There is no auto-save during each level so if you die and didn't quicksave it, you get to start all over again. The story is Ubercomical, yet almost seems Uberserious at times. The graphics and textures are Uberugly even at HD resolutions.You get XP during levels based on kill streaks to level up your Uberness which amounts to an Uberbullet shield, more health, additional accuracy, or longer Uberness. If you score 3 headshots in succession, your next headshot will rank you an Ubersniper granting you invincibility, unlimited ammo, and Uberaccuracy for a short time. If you score 3 melee kills in a row, your next melee kill will set you in a beserker rage where you just insta kill anyone that comes in contact with your knife. The skills are actually useful since there are endless hordes of Ubernazis that continue to spawn, sometimes even behind you in that last room you just cleared.Overall, Ubersoldier II is an Ubercheesy first person shooter that pretty much Uberstinks. I only dropped six quarters on it, but I'm still trying to convince myself that it was money well spent."

76561197967787986,Recommended,281410,26677610,"Posted: 18 November, 2016",all,Pitdeadite,Whether or not you will enjoy this game....pretty much relies on what you think of 'budget' titles. For those of you that are unfamiliar with the term....it's basically a game that can't really compete with it's bigger budgeted cousins....which is why they are usually priced much lower. These titles aren't meant to be game changers....they are simply diversions to tide people over until something better comes along. If you find that these games are your cup of tea....then please allow me to elaborate on the game's mechanics further. In a nutshell....Ubersoldier 2 is pretty much a shoddy knock off of the classic 'Wolfenstein' franchise. You are here to kill occultist Nazis and nothing more. You will encounter a decent amount of weapons in your travels....but you can only carry five different types at one time. One of those weapon slots will consist of your sidearm....another slot is for your rifle....then machine gun....heavy weapon....and grenades. The game relies on many stapes of WWII themed combat games....which means you have the usual Kar98....MP-40....Thompson....Panzershreck....ect. You won't find much in the way of anything special when it comes to the weapons....but luckily you have some special abilities to help you out. One of those is a shield....which deflects bullets but    won't allow you shoot the enemy either....unless they pass right through it. If you score three headshots in a row or knife three enemys back to back....then you can unlock Ubersoldier abilites....which are both centered around your character being invulnerable for a short time....in which you can either score numerous head shots with ease....or just run up and stab enemies with no fear. For a budget title....the graphics aren't bad at all. In fact....this is probably the greatest looking poor man's shooter that I've come across yet. Yeah....that might sound like a bold statement....but keep in mind that I own dozens of FPS shooters....and I can name off quite a few of those that are just downright horrible to look at. The game even has some snazzy weather effects....so when you find yourself fighting in the rain....drops of water will actually splash across the screen. It's nothing ground-breaking....but it is a nice touch. The levels are varied....but rather linear. So if you are in the mood for some exploration....you won't find anything like that here. There is only a handful of enemy types however....and they love to utilize cheap tactics. They will shoot from cover....run away while firing....and vault over obstacles....which your character can do none of. Sometimes the game will place an enemy unit so that it will be in a prime position to kill you within seconds....but thankfully these are few and far between. Some of the enemies are armed with flamethrowers....which also act as tractor beams. If your character gets lit up by chance....you will not be given an opportunity to run away....so you will just have to roll the dice and see if you can get out of range before you are burnt to a crisp. The story sucks....but there are some really well done comic inspired cut scenes to keep you informed....but you will be wishing the rest of the game was that creative. The game has multiplayer....but no one is actually playing it. In the end....I would recommend this game....but only when you compared it to it's cost. Right now the game is way overpriced at $9.99. If you want to pick up this game....then do what I did....and  wait for one of the major STEAM sales to come around....so that you will only have to pay pennies on the dollar for it.

It's worth playing.Scores:Functionality/Playability: 4/10 Not so near broken messGameplay: 7/10 Solid,but could have been so much betterVisuals: Don't really matter so rate how YOU wantSoundtrack: 3/10 Dull and uninteresting or out of placeFun and Enjoyment: 8/10 (Seriously! Just trust me in my review)Overall Score: 6/10 But really worth playingThe mechanics are pretty similar to a average fps, aside from a wierd default keybinding (try binding knife to space and sprint to shift and jump to e since you will rarely use it). The skill point system works well. melee gives you more points than headshots. If done correctly, you can finish a mission with 30+ skill points (the most I've ever gotten during a mission was 34) to spend on Health, Energy, Uber Shield, Emotion Time (crying and screaming while going on your invinsible murderous rampage) and Accuracy for the next mission. Helpful tip: max out accuracy ASAP! Your accuracy at the start of the game will be atrocious! Once you've done that, you'll be getting hundreds of headshot without even trying using automatic rifles and lmgs. Afterwards, upgrade everything else to your heart's contents (you won't have to worry about stasis shield unless your trying to become MLG with dope trick shots). Especially that emotion time! The SS or whatever will cower in fear as you slaughter their comrades while in tears crying like a baby (an invincible homicidal baby). The game's AI is.. interesting. They'll try to kill you but,, (for a better explaination, check out the gameplay from Inside Gaming on Youtube parts 1-4. You can go all the way to part 8 if you just want to watch Adam suffer while Bruce and James do their thing).The cutscenes are interesting, but are often either confusing or just flat out make no sense. They may or may not make you question your sanity. The game explains what exactly is going on; so luckily, you won't have to play whatever garbage the first Ubersoldier might have been.Lastly, the game's bosses (*SPOILER ALERT: Their are only four and you will be glad their are only four. Six if you count the two types of minis.)Now, about the bosses (*NOT A SPOILER: JUST A HELPFUL TIP) The strategies you need to defeat them is simple for everyone of the except for phase three of the last boss. As James from Inside Gaming explains perfectly in part 6 of their gameplay on YouTube: ""You just shoot 'em."" No puzzles, no QTEs, or anything; just shoot 'em 'til they die. It may seem like its not working since their's NO INDICATOR OF ACTUAL DAMAGE (blood!) As Bruce pointed out after Adam defeated the first boss; even though every enemy you've fought beforehand has bled when you filled them with bullets and shrapnel. And its actually the only thing that works. Trust me and James. Its all that works so don't bother trying anything else!Despite the game's bad (not quite terrible) functionality, the game is fun. I'm not sure how to explain it. It's just fun! Actually it might have something to do with feeling like a god when your emotion time kicks in from being a badass and start a murderous rampage during your temporary invinsibility. As well as watching the AI struggle to figure out how to kill you without killing themselves in a hilarious fashion. Like I said from the start of my review; this game is the rare breed known simply as: ""Its so bad, its good."""

On top of that, it also somehow manages to be slow- and fast paced action at the same time! At the SAME ♥♥♥♥ING TIME! Breaking all the known laws of physics.The game starts of with the very action traditional hot pursuit, like straight out from it's respectable TV-tropes article, where the player gets the use the worst machine gun in the history of war which only redeems itself with unlimited bullets without a need to reload and any risk of overheating. Magical! It is also a wonder how in the hell the scene still manages to feel fast paced when in comparison the god damn grannies with their shopping carts in a supermarket would seem like the ♥♥♥♥ing direct descendants of Hermes himself.After the chase, you get to have a little target practice with an unlimited supply of medkits and ammo while your NPC partners see's a padlock for the first time in her miserable life, and spends some quality time figuring out what is that sorcery keeping this seemingly wimpy gate closed despite all her efforts to let you through it.She's actually not the only one struggling with the doors in this game, as throughout it they seem to make a perfect Nazi repellent, bullet proof shield and in terms, have a similiar effect on them as the little flashy device from MIB. Somebody should have told that to the Polish back in the late thirties.The game also loves to use the traditional ""let's spawn♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of enemies here and play some action music"" trope to keep the player busy. This actually is quite fun thanks to the ""Emotion"" thing, which basically gives the player ability to act like a ♥♥♥♥ing God of War for a short span of time. Blurring the vision and allowing the player to move slightly faster, almost at a drunken plumber in the street of Dublin at 5AM Sunday morning velocity.There would be hellava lot more to say about this glorious beast of a game, but I'd say it's way better to experience first hand. Just remember, trying to hold down aim and shoot at the same time will confuse the character and make him do the dance of his people instead of actually firing his gun.

Its a shame because if they ditched the terrible story, lame cutscenes and hired decent voice actors this could have been a really great game... but as its stands its more of a funny ""B"" game.Of other things to note, there is not one, not two, but fifteen medkits around every single corner, door, hall and crate which is more funny than anything.  The flamethrower is extremely effective against you, but useless against enemies.  The ""bosses"" are extremely irritating, if I played the game again I would just use godmode for those parts as they are just very annoying.

The opening movie is stunningly bad. The first level is dog crap. The first thing I noticed about this game is that even with the graphics on full it is one of the worst looking games I have ever seen. The textures are blocky, bland, and ugly. I've seen better looking FPS games from 1996 and I am not kidding. It starts you off manning a machine gun on the back of a jeep with some girl driving. The first big problem is that the ride is so incredibly bumpy and jarring that you can't hit anything when you fire. You also have to do the whole driving part with one life bar and since it is so hard to hit anything because it feels like you are in a paint can mixer, good luck. I luckily beat it on my third try. At the end of it before level 2 you get to go on foot for a minute to kill a few guys while the girl opens a gate. The movement is not smooth at all. Your movement feels stiff and locked down. The shooting mechanics? I have seen better FPS shooting mechanics in, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, android phone games or even browser based flash games. Weapon sounds are horrible, and so is every other sound in the game. I made it about 15 minutes into level 2 then uninstalled it. It looks and feels like something a inexperienced two-man crew made as their first ever project.The fact that games like this can even get a score of 47/100 from a company like PC Gamer, and even worse a 62 total from metacritic is hilarious and makes me wonder what in God's name was going through their heads when they reviewed this. Did they play it with their eyes open? Hell, even a blind person could tell this sucks based on its horrifyingly bad sound. Oh and it has, predictably, some of the worst voice acting of all time. Not funny bad, just bad.I consider a 1/10 to be fundamentally horrible in every way. This game functions and you can play it, and when you shoot things they die, but beyond that, I cannot bring myself to give it anything above a 3/10. When you have a FPS game that Daikatana is better than, then you know it is a horrible piece of garbage. May God have mercy on the human race when he comes to earth and see's♥♥♥♥♥♥like this.

Felt like a budget version of the first one which was not a triple-A product to begin with, but still like a B-class war movie with a bit of Wolfenstein and other old school shooters.I was kind a surprised that the sequel even exists so I picked it from the last Steam Summer Sale for a couple bucks. It was fairly priced, like straight-to-video rental sequel, which Ubersoldier II suitably is with subpar production values and thin plotline.The first one was not anything too special but it was fun to play as Neo against Nazis by stopping bullets and sending them back. It was a nice feature to have fighting against the telekinesis super soldiers and other UberNazis. Too bad that the sequel does remind me all of that, but does it way worse than the first one.You play as an Allied Ubersoldier named Karl from the previous game. He must destroy the rest of the SS guys who still want to produce ubersoldiers, waste the rest of the world and rule the universe. With him travels one damsel in distress which you need to escort and protect time to time. Karl makes his way around the world from Europe to Africa to Himalayas but it’s more like kill bad guys while travelling from point A to point C via point B.Action’s pace is slow in general. Even the car turret shooting scene at the beginning is slow as post-war trial. The shooting is sluggish but easy; enemies are easy to hit to the head which will award you an uberaccurate slow motion Ubersniper-perk if you manage to kill three enemies by a headshot in certain time. It’s easier than you think. The other way to turn into a slaughter machine is to stab people to death three times in a row. By that way you get a Berserk-perk which with you can kill people with one knife hit.During these “emotions” player is completely invulnerable so it’s easy to waste battalions of soldiers in a few seconds. There’s no really a cool down to these abilities so you need just to kill next three people you come up after the Berserk or Ubersniper ends. It’s somewhat essential that player uses the knife and get headshots because they also bring experience points.I just spent the points to prolong the Ubersniper and Berserk perks, more health and more accuracy. Because you can find health packs almost anywhere and while in berserk you get the health back while making your knife red.The only real challenges are offered by the stupid telekinetic super soldiers and 10 feet ubersoldiers. They both nail you to the ground with their rocket launchers or mini tornados. But if you stay well covered and sink few headshots they’re just a couple minute obstacles.Comparing the first encounter with the telekinesis guy was way more epic in the first one, the guy just appeared at the long dark road and started to fly stuff at you and it was like in a tornado all a sudden. In the sequel the guy just walks down the stairs in bright daylight and starts to fly sand at your eyes, such a disappointment.Overall Ubersoldier II is not very uber. I was just uberbored while playing it. Even the normal fights had more adrenaline in them than boss fights. The makers were even ripping the design of the female elite soldiers from Return the Castle Wolfenstein. Comic styled cut scenes are not well made or the 3D-cinematic ones. Dialogue is cheesy and the studio members were probably playing the roles themselves. It’s playable, easily beaten in 4-5 hours, but it’s just a below average FPS and only worth when in -75% or up sale. 4/10I sincerely hope that Steam gets the first one to the catalogue. That was uberfun."

,Recommended,281410,11720081,"Posted: 15 August, 2014",all,kschang77,"Ubersoldier is weird game where Eastern Europeans write games where the hero kills lots and lots of Nazis... and localizers tried to make it sound... American, ending up with a weird mess. But at its heart, it's about, well, killing bad guys with lots and lots of bullets. And that it does very well... but it's nothing we haven't seen before.You play Karl Stolz, who escaped from the Ubersoldier program headed by a mad Nazi scientist (another videogame trope) who resurrect dead soldiers to make them perfect killing machines (duh). In the first game Karl destroyed the T-8 drug machine and killed the mad scientist, but the nightmare had not ended. The Resistance is still fighting Ubermacht, the secret Nazi unit responsible and there are rumors that the mad scientist is not dead, and there's an uberhenchman that's unstoppable... Thus the sequel.The shooter itself is well made. There's no lean and blind-fire, but the physics and ragdoll effects are quite good. Throw a grenade and expect boxes and weapons blown all over the place. You are expected to use environment to your advantage. Shoot exploding barrels like grenades, use grenades to flush Nazis out of cover and headshot them. Use stun grenades to incapacitate them to knife them easier. So on and so forth. Enemies will do the same to you, but it's pretty old trope. The occasional mini-bosses, the snipers on window ledges, the ambush... it's typical designs, and you can almost SEE the trigger points before you hit them.What separates this from most ""shoot Nazi"" games is the inclusion of two uber-modes... Ubersniper, and Berserker. If you score 3 headshots (quickly) and score a 4th within 60 seconds, you get ""ubersniper"", where time slows down and enemies are highlighted, giving you much easier headshots, which also adds to your uber-time. If you score 3 knife kills, and a 4th within 60 seconds, you get Berserker mode, which gets you invulnerability temporarily, so you can knife even more people.Berserker mode trigger also gives you 10 XP while headshots give you 5, and subsequent ones only give 1 XP. The XP's can be used to upgrade your abilities, from health to accuracy, more Ubertime to other attributes, in a bit of RPG-likeness.Graphics are good, and the game's not TOO difficult on easy mode, except near the end, where enemies ambush, use grenades a lot, and guard keypoints with non-stop firing MG42's (obviously not realistic), and backup with snipers that move around a lot. The end boss is even MORE stupid, as it is practically invulnerable to weapons. (sorta spoiler)There is no ""where to go next"" nav marker, but the levels are NOT that hard to figure out. Though remember to qucksave, as autosave doesn't kick in often enough.There are a couple problems, with the sole female protagonist, Maria (yes, it's a proper German name) portrayed as sexy (in some outfits you can see nipples behind the shirt) even in a warzone. And there were kisses here and there (with Karl, of course) and of course, focus on the more, uh... feminine parts when she's in the cutscene.Cutscenes are drawn comic-book panel style, which are quite well done, but the voice-acting... Well, the German don't sound German... They sound American. And yes, they were shouting in English in bad accent. *sigh*But it's a good shooter... Better than most ""budget shooters"" you find in the bargain bins. For $5, (or $2.50 on sale) you can't really miss."

I loved this game! Of course game play and graphics are not going to be up there with new games but overall this was really fun to play! For this sort of money how can anyone complain! They even tried to sex it ip a bit with the ladies curves and what appeared to be scammel wheel nuts poking through their t-shirts! I played in single player mode because I am a sad old man who can't keep up with the youngsters! But even in my sad little world I beat the bad guys hands down! In my view, buy it you won't regret it! Scammel wheel nuts or not!"

In my head, Ubersoldier is an amazing game but my friend always tells me otherwise to the point that it is now a running joke. He never got past level one but i'm sure if he had persevered, he would have acknowledged the awesomeness of Ubersoldier(not available on steam) and its sequel(available on steam)."

Although the AI is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and tend to do things that any sane human being would never do, it adds a lot to the flawed charm of this game.I enjoyed playing this game and would recommend it to anyone, as long as they realize that this is not a AAA Game and has its fair share of goofy issues. I'd definitely call it a flawed gem."
