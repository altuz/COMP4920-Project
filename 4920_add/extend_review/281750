I wouldn't not recommend it, but I'm also not certain I would recommend it either... It's one of those games that's not terrible but not great. I enjoy some of the puzzles, but find myself only able to play for about 20 minutes before getting bored. It feels like a shell for something that could/should have been more.The gameplay is smooth however and the puzzles, which can at times be annoying, aren't overly difficult. If I found myself stumped at any point, I simply stopped for the day and when I started it up the next day with fresh eyes, I solved the puzzle right away. I find it plays just as easily whether using a mouse or a controller and didn't find myself preferring one over the other at all.Graphically, while the art style has a certain charm to it, it can get monotous and at times ugly. I actually feel like I would've liked this game a lot more and could have forgiven its lackluster gameplay if it had just looked prettier. It feels bare partially because it looks bare. When you make a game as basic as Munin, you need to make it stand out in some other way, whether it be art direction or sound design or something like that. Speaking of sound design... I honestly can't even recall the sound in this game. It was that forgettable. Is there music? Probably. Are there sound effects? Probably. Nothing that stood out enough to me that I can actually bring to mind any of it though.Overall Munin is an absolutely middling game. For the $.99 it's currently selling for on sale (which is what I paid for it), I'd say it's worth it. I would most definitely NOT pay the full price of $10 though. This feels like it shouldn't cost more than $5 at most, and honestly I can't help but feel kind of bad for those folks who've paid full price for a game that feels like a demo or the final project of an undergrad."

The rotation mechanic adds a cool dimension to the puzzles and the Norse themes and overall the art style make the game stand out for me. I would definitely recommend Munin.
76561198045604308,Recommended,281750,13454080,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,TheSlacker,"Munin is a great puzzle/platformer game. It doesn't do anything groundbreakingly innovative, but it sticks to a formula that has proven to work with indie platformers and they have executed it in a unique and captivating way.So if you can't tell the game's lore is Norse. It fits the game and genre well. I have never played a Norse game like this and the story or informative pieces of the game are conveyed through short snipets of dialog about each of the worlds at the beginning of each chapter. They provide neat little background information.The game follows the same formula many other platofrmers follow. Thre is a world tree, and each world has 9 levels, except for Asgard. Each world introduces a new kind of mechanic to learn and progress through puzzles. They fit the game nicely and make sense.Puzzle are moderately difficult. You shouldn't be stuck on a level forever, nor should you be able to breeze through the majority of levels. The game is well balanced. However, overall the game is relatively short. There are no bonus levels and once it is over, it is over. Achievements will keep you busy for another hour or two.Conclusion: Braid was groundbreaking and innovative when it came out years ago and started this indie games/platforming phenomenon. This game doesn't do that. But it is a wonderfully enjoyable game that I would put up there with Braid, Fly'N, TRINE, LIMBO, SMB, and Fez if you take it for what it is."

I always have trouble with puzzle games where timing is important. In this game, you usually just need to figure out a safe place to stand while rotating the other parts of the puzzle. There are a couple of parts where being too slow can kill you, but even in those, you don't need to be really quick, just not stop until you're safe.Usually I need help with puzzle games after the first few levels, but in Munin, I've managed to get to the last world all by myself. It has taken a lot of trial and error, but fortunately you have two or three worlds available simultaneously, so if you get stuck in one, you can go to another and come back later. Also, the puzzles are logical, so you should find the answer, if you just have the patience to try all options available.As many of the other reviews say, Munin isn't anything ground-breaking, but it's still fun."

,Recommended,281750,28746656,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Aureus,"Munin is a combination of two games. Both of them are puzzle games, but will make you feel completely different.The first one is a simple, casual, FEZ-like experience - there is no open world, nevertheless the game requires reshaping its levels and looking for new connections between seperate parts of the areas. It allows you to take your time, think your way through a level and enjoy the music as well as the dark, moody graphics. I really like this experience.However: every time you die the game forces you to play the entire level from the beginning. During the first, casual parts of the game it's not a problem, since you are allowed to make mistakes while playing and to experiment with your surroundings without being constantly punished. This ""first game"" is hidden in various parts of Munin and is not just a first ""part"" of the game.But that's where the ""second game"" comes in. Multiple ""worlds"" (sets of levels) have included mechanics which are lethal for the player's character - rivers of lava, rolling boulders, lasers and so on. In these worlds almost every mistake results in a respawn, and if you are not that good in puzzle games and/or you don't have a good reflex and precise controls, you will try-and-error each level multiple times, repeating the same actions over and over again. Just like in the games from the 80's and 90's which couldn't afford to be that long and instead required multiple attempts to beat their harder parts.If it's not a problem for you, you may find Munin an amazing experience. However I kinda hate repeating the same thing four, eight or twelve times just because I fail in the later parts of the level. That's where I start to become less enchanted and more annoyed and start to hope to find more levels from the ""first game"" - less challenging, yes, but also less frustrating. Especially since I don't consider respawning the player and moving him back a challenge.A bonus minor issue: jumping is sometimes pretty bad and counterintuitive.From other positives: each world makes a good job teaching the player what its unique mechanics do and how to exploit them. The game tries to represent Nordic myths without using cliches and stupid popcultural nonsense as horned helmets, Thor's hammers, snakes and so on. Developers actually tried to represent their very own interpretation of Edda (or maybe Poetic Edda, I'm not sure) and focus on the mood of various realms. Sometimes it results in quite silly ideas (especially lasers), but there are pretty interesting visual designs and majority of the game provides maximum results from minimal resources.My favourite part of the games is when an enormous giant (nomen omen) shows up in the background and just casually passes by. It could not even be there, but was a fascinating view supported by cool sound effects. Unfortunatelly there is not many addition like that, but they are surely very welcome.Some of the levels have also their own sounds and music, what is also cool.Not a perfect game, but it doesn't need to be (especially if you buy it for like one euro) and it doesn't try to please everyone. If you think it's screenshots and promotional video look attractive and you like puzzle games, you will probably not regreat giving it a shot."

The introduction of new mechanics for each of the worlds you'll be puzzling your way through keeps things fresh, and while the early puzzles in each world can be easy they are definitely introductions to the later ones which require a lot more thought and planning.

,Recommended,281750,32548627,Posted: 18 June,all,Cuddly Kitty,"Overall, I would highly recommend this game, especially if you like puzzle/platformers.  The levels are very well designed with almost every world centered on one particular obstacle or feature.  Generally, you start out with simpler stages that show you the feature in question before you take what you learned and apply it to larger, more complex levels, an excellent example of the ""teach without teaching"" principle.  The final world is a potpourri of everything that you have learned previously and is understandably harder, requiring a good amount of thought and planning to get through.  However, even after playing through every stage, I had yet to come across a single obtuse moment or rely on a solution that came completely out of left field.My only gripe with this game is that some of the worlds are so dark that it can be very difficult to see where the walls, floors, and ceilings are, though the stages are still quite doable after some stumbling around."

The game mechanics is fun and the game runs fluid.

Often puzzle games feel pretty bare-bones, but this one has great atmosphere which it draws from it's creative use of establishing a setting. The whole time I was not only driven by the fun and increasingly challenging puzzles and the introduction of new mechanics but that I wanted to see Asgard! It was a nice surprise, kudos to the designers for making such great puzzles."
,Not Recommended,281750,13270475,"Posted: 7 December, 2014",all,Aurthem,"Passable puzzle platformer utilizing level rotation as a core mechanic.Difficulty comes from the fact that you can't rotate sections with your character in them, and some random platformer tropes. You get 8 chapters of several levels each introducing single mechanic (first one is introductory): switches, laser switches, killing lasers, boulders, water, lava, revealing runes. Then 9th chapter combines them all in a couple of levels.While Munin's art style and music aren't bad, its main problem lies in the mechanics. Usually you rotate sections a couple of times, get the feeling of level's ecosystem, then proceed to collect feathers. The game doesn't present problems to solve, only obstacles to overcome - thus, you don't feel smarter when you succeed, you feel exhausted and relieved after the tediousness of it all.Still, the game took some time to finish and provided a different experience compared to the rest of the puzzle platformers, though not always in a good way. Play it if you want, but know that there are better games in this genre."

Also, maybe it's my computer but some of the time my jump command doesn't make it through or is a bit delayed.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this. While the game looks nice and unique and has Norse mythology, there was basically no storytelling. All you do is rotate different parts of the terrain to reach the feathers. To me, some puzzles were easy, some even too easy, while the rest were too difficult to solve.If there had been storytelling between the levels or during them, I wouldn't have stopped and asked for a refund before the first hour, but without a told reason for doing it it feels pointless, which is why I gave up on the hard levels so easily.

Be warned: you will die many unfair and frustrating deaths due to hazards phasing through walls or detecting collision when you're a safe distance away.The premise of the gameplay appealed to me greatly, but the puzzles it presents are merely tedious, rather than challenging. The game rarely punishes you for trial-and-error gameplay (in fact, many levels are designed to allow multiple paths to completion), which means you can act practically at random and still get through most of the game without much difficulty. The only really interesting puzzles were in the ninth and final chapter.The background art is fantastic, but most of the game objects seem to have been given more cursory treatment. Graphics aren't particularly important to me, but the awkward, blocky character sprite and platforms seemed incongruous with the vast, beautiful (or menacing) landscapes."

The big problem is that the movement is just garbage.  The momentum/inertia, rate of falling, and jump speed are not properly tuned at all, so you feel sluggish and simple things take forever.  ""Dying"" resets the whole map, which makes for a very frustrating experience very quickly.  The artwork for the animated entities is really not great - there's not much animation to speak of and they don't fit in with the surrounding environment.  Would not recommend at any price."

76561198038442109,Recommended,281750,19205670,"Posted: 21 November, 2015",all,FlashGordon,This game was difficult as intended. The graphics are simple not to distract from the puzzle. There are levels you must think out of the box. If you play it you will get that hint. For what I paid I spent many an hour to solve these. It was very fun for me. The back drop and music were meant to be artsy and poetic so don't expect too much for a less than $5 game. The makers of these levels took some real talent in the creating. The low meta score I can see is due to frustrated players I'm guessing couldn't finish.
,Recommended,281750,18898224,"Posted: 5 November, 2015",all,«Riniel»,"I loved this game! It was super fun.The goal is to collect all the feathers. There are 9 worlds with 77 levels. Each world has a different obstacle you have to work with, like platforms, water, lava, boulders, matching runes. Only the last world combines some of these obstacles to make it trickier. You spin parts of the level in order to make a path for your character to walk through safely. Most of the time you have a lot of time to think about what you are doing. A few times you need to move quick."

The annoyance at the difficulty was welcome though!  It's good when a game is hard enough that you feel compelled to step away from it and cool off, but engaging enough that you come back to finish it before much time has passed."

A poorly-animated and uncanny creature runs around ""interesting"" puzzles and refuses to speak or do much other than perpetually stare at me, the player, with that uncanny-valley face that's as much bird as it is human. While I appreciate the concept, I am thoroughly disappointed in its presentation. 2/10, the puzzles are at least enjoyable when they aren't dumb as all hell (the water mechanic makes no sense)"

,Recommended,281750,20168184,"Posted: 31 December, 2015",all,Cadfang01,I definetly recomend this game to anyone who like puzzles. Its one of those nice go at your own pace puzzles and as you would expect it does get pretty damn tricky. Its a nice little mind tickler plus I have to give credit to the creators for getting a lot of the Norse mythology down pretty good. It's an absolutely beautiful little game. All in all this is one of the few puzzle games I really enjoy playing. So if you have some time to waste and don't mind getting frustrated at your own pace definetly check it out.

You can get it for less then a buck, the art is really good, the puzzles are very complex and the story is decent too. Still, I am not good at puzzle games and by the ending I was so frustrated. If you die you have to start over and that is easily the worse part. I did enjoy the game but the game deceptively gets harder as you get to later episodes. If you enjoy puzzle games for a good price then this is totally for you. For me, I enjoyed it until I had to use a walkthrough to finish it."

,Not Recommended,281750,35437175,Posted: 2 October,all,Annabeth,"Honestly, even if this game wasn't such a disappointment (which it is) there will always be something better to waste your time with. Puzzles are challenging, yes, but the biggest puzzle you can't solve is why you are solving these puzzles. Like, why? Of course there is the fact that you paid to solve them but what are the intentions of the main character? First of all, how did we end up here? We seem to be able to shift the world and by that I mean we can rotate scenery like pieces of a puzzle, but there is no explanation on who we are or how we obtained this power. Are we trapped somewhere? Cause if we are not this means we have to face 77 levels of Munin taking a stroll around the block.Side note: I was/am unaware of Munin as a mythological figure so it gets worse for me, because I truly was expecting a trip to Norse mythology. It's even on the description:""Experience the exciting world of Norse mythology"" How? The only thing you'll experience about Norse mythology is the scenery. And that won't matter too because you keep changing it.The puzzles were able to interest me for 0.3 hours as my game record states and after that I was just ""nah, I won't pass this level just to see the next one for no reason""However, I bought this game on a big sale, so I'm not incrediby sad. Interestingly, I didn't see the publisher was Daedalic Entartainment until I already purchased it, and after playing a bunch of their games I feel safe to come to this conclusion:If Daedalic is involved, the game has potential to be either really good or complete♥♥♥♥♥♥"
