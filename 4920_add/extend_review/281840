Clunky controls, ok voice acting, not that good looking, and overal the game feels kind of cheap (yea i know it's 5 dollars but still feels cheap). Don't expect Dear Esther, Stanely Parable, Dream, or Gone Home, those games in terms of their genre are way more higher quality in every aspect than what we got here. I'd tell you to get it when it's 1 dollar or less."

While I love traditional gaming, I'm always interested in trying something unique, and it was the apparent uniqueness of 4pm that made me want to try it out right away.But even with those caveats, the game is slight. It takes maybe 20 minutes to complete, though I bet someone could do it in 5 minutes a second time through. Your interactivity with the game world is limited to walking forward and clicking on a small handful of items, like answering machines and doors. The story is entirely linear until the finale when you're presented with a series of choices, which I assume changes the ultimate outcome.So since it's not much of a game in the traditional sense what we have left is the story, and it is an interesting one, albeit clumsy and brief. Without wanting to give too much away your character appears to be a 20-something party girl, and the story is a parable on alcoholism and memory, which is a refreshing change from the constant barrage of orcs and guns and blue haired lolitas that constitute much of gaming.Since Steam only offers a thumbs up or a thumbs down I'm not recommending it because it's just a little too sloppy in both story and gameplay for 5 bucks, but on a 5-star scale I'd put it more at a 2 or 2.5, worth a go if you find any of the aforementioned elements interesting."

It's true that it might not be a real ""game"", but I would really like to see more of this. A good compromise between a movie and a (too) complex game. Perfect for people who want to relax after a day of work (most AAA games tend to be too complex or are dumb shooters).The only problem here is for sure that it's just 30 minutes long. But I see it more as a teaser for other games like this to come. Make it 1,5-2 hours long and tell a nice story, I have the feeling that there's some potential in this.4€ is a fair price (that's worth 1 bigmac(!) in the analog world)."

The biggest letdown of this game is that it feels very unpolished. At one point, I got stuck in a wall while dancing. That being said, there were many more positives than negatives. The way the main character unfolded through the story was wonderful. The story is just ambiguous enough to satisfy any story searcher's lust, and even after the story was over, I still felt like attempting to connect some of the dots in the story.Overall, this is a 70% solid interactive story. 7/10"

Although the story is just thrown in your face, you somewhat get to know a little of our troubled heroine.

Although I see it as something of mild entertainment, it unfortunately doesn't last the quid's worth of it. You're essentially a depressed alcoholic by the name of Caroline who ""supposedly"" makes decisions throughout the game that would forever change your life and the story you're in. And yes, this all happens in about 30-40 minutes.When they said ""short"", they really meant short. Usually when the term ""short"" is used to define a game's length, it often means a few hours worth of gameplay, not breaking the half hour mark. Some demos for other similar indie games manage to surpass such a time limit and offer even more content. The game itself in my honest opinion isn't bad though it throws you into such odd situations without any consistency that you're basically left sitting there wondering how you ended up where you did. I'm aware that it's a narrative story and you're just in the shoes of Caroline and how she goes through this specific day but there's a lot to work with when it comes to such serious topics of impairment and death.You're pretty much paying around 10 cents for every minute that passes with this game and for what it is as a whole, isn't worth it for any price tag. It qualifies more as a college experiment or a school assignment in media arts, but not a game. If we were to categorize this as a ""game"", then it's no better than a demo.It's not bad in my opinion but I'm not a picky gamer, as for the price tag, unacceptable. Do not recommend unless it's free and you have the bandwidth to download it. (The game is about 3GB's the last time I checked, for what reason I have no clue)."

Dear Esther, Gone Home, and Kentucky Route Zero are among my favorite games, so when I heard about 4PM I had high hopes. Unfortunately, 4PM just doesn't deliver. I play story-driven games to be told a good *story*, and 4PM's is just... bad. It stars an incredibly unlikeable, unrelatable (at least for me) protagonist. The whole 20-minute experience exists to deliver the twist at the end, which ends up not being particularly exciting. There are a few parts where you can make choices, but they end up not mattering at all. If you choose wrong you essentially get a game over and can start again at the decision. The whole story is cliche.I wasn't sure whether the negativity around this game was just people hating on walking simulators (user reviews for Gone Home are bad too, but I loved that game) - but no, even if you like artsy story-driven games, this game really is just that bad.

The concepts and feelings in the game accelerated far too quickly, and even if the game is supposed to be extended it shouldn't have been released until it had those scenes. There were no clear transitions, the zoom feature only worked once in the entire game, and there is only twoways to affect the outcome. The charecters are difficult to enjoy and frankly are incredibly one sided. perhaps scenery could have extended this but it was so blurry objects were often indistinguishable from their enviornment.Also the whole First person to third person, to cinematic view points just made it seem like a gimmick.

This is basically like watching a short film, except that you have to click a few times to advance the story. I don't know why they bothered to make this game interactive, the choices you have to make are rudimentary, and have no bearing on the outcome except at the very end when there are two endings. The one challenge (sneaking past somebody) is more awkward to complete than it should be, and is made more frustrating by the fact that there is no ""skip dialogue"" button. The interface is really quite annoying, with its ""blurry drunk"" simulation, it also was quite jerky on my machine even with settings cranked down. It's not in the same league as Dear Esther or The Stanley Parable and feels very amateurish. Worth a brief look but I would rate it only 5/10."

Very soon obvious clues all around spell out that Caroline is never two minutes without a booze bottle connected to her lips. Why? Well theres no puzzle to solve there, since we get tortured as to why through a few dizzy flash backs both recent and distant, which are as painful to watch as having a grapefruit thrusted into your eye socket. Blurry scenes, drunken wanderings and bad loud music, will either inflict you with a piercing head ache or a stomach churn worthy of a suicide jump.This walking/staggering/crawling simulator with zero puzzles is about 18 minutes in length. The topic of it is all about alcoholism, suicide and despair, and of which the noble moral statements are so flimsy, paper-thinned presented that I forgot them quicker than Caroline would have at happy hour.

The beginning of the game seems to imply a pivotal moment for the game's protagonist, with the remainder encompassing the player living out the events that potentially contributed to this conclusion.  Instead however, one potential decision veers the entire story onto a different track, whereby the life of another individual begins to occupy the forefront of the story.  Decisions for potential courses in conversation ultimately become elusive as a few options (i.e. ""agree"" or ""disagree"") result in statements that elicit specifics that could not have been predicted given the ostensible implications of the options themselves. And while one of the endings may be designed to terminate the story on a lingering cliffnote, the conclusion in question is not only abrupt but lacks a true sense of finality, not merely leaving the player to speculate about a potential ending, but innumerable different scenarios in which the conversation in progress might ultimately proceed, not to mention a wide variety of potential events to follow.Furthermore, although I acknowledge that this particular mechanic is designed to emphasize the pathetic nature of a rather tragic individual, there's something inherently frustrating about being ellicited mission objectives that the player knows are detrimental to the character's well-being.  In essence, these involve being tasked with actions triggered by the protagonist's alcoholism and thus self-destructive nature and it feels more than a little ackward when the goal of the game is to make the character's life even more miserable in both the short- and long-term spectrum.While the game is built around a unique mechanic that takes the player through more down-to-earth events, reminiscent of real world problems, and boasts attractive lighting and set designs(not to mention a very low price-tag), I ultimately can't reccommend it for purchase."

In 4PM you play as Caroline a complete drunk and essiantly the game is about her trying to pull her life back together. So how is 4PM ? Its absolutly awfull. The game barely works and half of the time its too boring to push to the end. So lets begin with the good. Great premise. The story is great and sometimes moving but thats pretty much it. The games controls are bad and the graphics are bad. But from what i understand its to simulate a real life drunk person. The game barely makes sense on what you need to do so pretty much all you is press on random things and hope it works. The game is also confusing to navigate. The Voice work is abysmal to say the least. This game is also incredibly short around half an hour and im incredibly dissapointed in this title.

Sloppy narrative writing - I find irritating.Great idea, though!I think there are narrative mystery games that do it better.  I did, however, play it to the end, so I that must mean it wasn't so bad."
,Not Recommended,281840,25679315,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,Scrubsauce,"The screenshots and trailers of this game all looked gorgeous, and despite the length issues I'd heard about, the subject matter interested me in game-form. It was an honest-to-gosh original concept that I hadn't experienced or seen tackled in any of the dozens of games I've tackled to beat over the last half-decade or so.  So, despite the immense negativity surrounding this title, I opted to pick it up on deep discount.I really wanted to give this game a chance, I did!  I played through multiple endings over the course of ~1-2 hours.  The length wasn't the issue for me, as I think it's perfectly reasonable to try and tell an interesting story for a cheap enough price tag with a short run time (the length of time I spent on this title is approaching industry standard for a full-on film, I wonder why an hour in a game seems so much shorter?).  Unfortunately, the game gets in its own way more times than I was comfortable with.  Some of the characters' vocal delivery might be fine...or it might not be?  It could be an artifact of sketchy lip synching, or just poor voice over work in the first place, or poor script writing, or poor direction of decent talent, or some chimera-beast of an issue involving all of the aboveproblems.  Either way, a lot of the dialog comes off as choppy and ill-timed.Graphically the game IS beautiful, but probably more-so in still format than anything else.  I had several issues in my playthroughs with models not loading and characters flat out being invisible during cut scenes (even the BIG cut scene at the end of one of the possible story forks).  I gave up and resorted to YouTube playthroughs to get a sense of what I was missing.Control-wise, the game handles like a drunk, which I guess is the point for many of the scenes, but it just felt so unresponsive and not something I dictated as the player so much as I casually suggested and sometimes the player character would listen.  Very odd handling, this is one of those games that makes you aware of the character having two separate legs and can throw you off entirely from what you're expecting with tighter WASD handling in FPS style games.The one thing this game does do right is the soundtrack, I'd love a copy of the credits song and the club banger toward the beginning of the story, but haven't had any luck tracking down those songs online.  If any game could benefit from having soundtrack DLC, this would be it.Overall, the game feels very much like an art-house film or a student project.  I love the idea, and what the developers were trying to convey, though the lack of support to fix the technical issues really hurts their credibility in my eyes.  Games are not films, if you want the player to be able to experience the art you've created, you have to attend to technical issues or risk alienating your audience entirely on this product and future ones.  Subject-matter-wise, this is a step in the right direction, but the execution is so lacking I can't reccomend it unless if you find it on sale for a huge discount beyond the $3 asking price of the store as of this writing."

Ever since I played ""Dear Esther"" I've been looking for as many first-person, story-driven games as i can find. ""4PM"" is one of the best I've played in a long time.The graphics aren't necessariliy great, but they get the job done without getting in the way of the story or gameplay. The voice acting is better than in most games. I especially liked the option of jumping forward to the next part of the game. If you like minigames like trying to sneak out of the office, you can play thtough them. But if you get stuck in them, as I did in that part, it doesn' thave to stop you from reaching the end of the game.If there were more episodes or chapters of this game, continuing the story, I'd definitely go along for the ride."
