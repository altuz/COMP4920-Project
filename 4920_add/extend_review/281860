,Recommended,281860,9662979,"Posted: 29 March, 2014",all,Sam,"Finally the renowned doujin Shoot'em up trilogy ""The Tale of ALLTYNEX"" is getting released on Steam. Starting with RefleX the second game in the series.Gameplay:Polished and intuitive, the key mechanic of the game is your ships relfecting shield. When activated the shield reflects bullets, but your ships energy is drained fast and when it gets low enough the shield stops working and even your weapons get weaker. So using the reflector-shield requires timing and strategy, mastering the game requires a lot of pattern recognition, good timing and knowing when to use the shield.Sound:The sound design is spot-on, catchy electronic retro music. With nice sound effect feedback from explotions and hits.Graphics:Looks basically like an Arcade game from the early 90's. But with some modern effects like lensflares and transparencies. It's pretty good looking for a low resolution 2D game, but the animation is somewhat lacking. The explotions and lazer effects look however satisfying.Overall:Impressive for a Doujin game, this could have passed as an professionally produced Arcade game in the 90's. I would recommend this game for any veteran fans of the Shoot'em up genre, the gameplay and music is top notch. But the graphics do look dated, and it is a shame that the developer did not allow making modifications to the game, so it is missing Steam achievements and leaderboards. Also the game lacks configuration options in-game, you have to find the config executable in the steamapps/common/RefleX directory.For people completely new to the genre, out of the games available on Steam I still recommend starting out with Ikaruga. The only reason being it looks modern and has a great well polished PC port with full Steam features. However RefleX is likely more fun and easier to grasp than Ikaruga for beginners, but not everyone will accept the dated look."

,Recommended,281860,12759832,"Posted: 3 November, 2014",all,Mr. X,"Reflex is a older Bullet Hell game that was recently ported to Steam.Graphics are similar to the 16-bit era, rather simplistic but still appealing.The music is, like a lot of BH games, highly addictive. Personally, I feel that Angel Dust (Entropy battle) and Air (Stage 6) are the best in game, though The Scorpions Poison (Scorpio Battle) is a close runner up."

Every Game Over you accumulate a continue for your next  game. I stored up 50 continues for my run to the end and used 30. RefleX had me cursing a few times but most the time I accepted my lack of skill or the seemingly impossible odds of survival.

76561197993869948,Recommended,281860,11804710,"Posted: 21 August, 2014",all,Superscope,"Pros- Solid mechanics. The reflect shield can be used not only to reflect to block/reflect shots but to continue combos further than normal (hint - you can reflect a homing laser you reflected alread- Sprites are good.- Not too hard, nor too easy either. Perfect scale of difficalty.- The zodiacs (HUGE constructs powered by god like power cores) are pretty boss as enemies.Cons- Parts of the story is explained in the pdf manual. This can lead players in the dark story wise if they rely on the game itself to tell the story."

It took me a bit to get involved in the game, but once I have played a while I am really enjoying the game, even more than Alltynex. Proper difficulty level, smart use of the reflex, big bosses, some Ikaruga like enemies, make reflex a great shoot em up. I strongly recommend it.Once I've beaten it, I recommend it even more. In the top ten of shoot em ups.From the ones I've played till now (Dec-14)1 Ikaruga2 Radiant Silvergun3 Thunderforce IV4 Reflex5 Gradius Gaiden6 Sine Mora7 Atomic Runner-Chelnov8 Thunderforce III9 R-Type10 Alltynex"

There is so much more to this game that it requires greater elucidation.RefleX is the standard by which any 2-D shmup and bullet-hell ought to measure by.  The gameplay is ingeniously integrated, and the story is told and inferred exquisitely within every stage.  You don't need a tutorial; the controls are seamless, intuitive, and gratifying.  More happens in an hour with RefleX than an entire season of your average, slow TV series.  I have never been more impressed with a game of this genre.RefleX may not do absolutely everything right, but by goodness, it does literally nothing wrong."

Everything is great from the game flow, mechanics, music, etc.  It does play in a low resolution (1280x960 max), but the game was so great that I overlooked that annoyance."

,Not Recommended,281860,21555327,"Posted: 29 February, 2016",all,Duv,"Your standard bullet hell shmup, but pretty bland. No special features to it, just a vertical scrolling shooter. This isn't a bad thing, plenty of shooters are this standard, but nothing about this is fun. The patterns are few and weak, the music is just there, and the visuals are actually nice. More movement based than pattern based. A mediocre shmup. If you're looking for more on Steam youCOULDbuy this, but there are many better ones to find."

My only beef is that some quicker bullets are nearly impossible to see when the screen is lit up with tons of them."

,Recommended,281860,11969302,"Posted: 3 September, 2014",all,Mr Icarus,"RefleX is an awesome shmup from Japanese indie studio Siter Skain. Since I got it i've been obsessively trying to comeplete it and learn its patterns. I'd even go as far to reccomend it for people looking to get into the shmup and bullet hell genres. RefleX gives the player a lifeline in the form of a reflective shield that can bounce some bullets back and inflict big damage on your enemies, you have to be careful though, you shield isnt infinite and doesnt protect you from everything.Check out my video on it if you'd like to know more!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9QF1K9pOeI"

,Recommended,281860,19300842,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,CheeseCake,"I actually pirated the game before this but I bought it, cuz, hey 50% off! (and I wanted actual English instead of the Jap ver I had)Of the three games, this one had the best music and boss fights.The reflection gimmick is balanced by the fact you only have ONE life but all that armor you got on is way more HP than the lives you get on Kamui.Contuining from your first death invalidates your score at the end but you get to keep any Areas you passed for Area Select for practice.Scores are only valid for 1 CC runs unfortunately. (Farthest I truly got was Stage 3/4 Cancer [Human Type] boss fight on 1 CC and that was from pure luck)The game also encourages you to reflect kill since it gives a score multiplier bonus depending on kills made within a small duration of time. (So you can reflect shot something then use regular bullets to keep that score multiplier but it'll go away after 1 sec)"

Can't get enough of blowing up stuff and deflecting lasers all over the place. Super fun Shmup. does not seem to save my score after each session of play and no online leader boards oh well. An exellent addition for the beginner/intermediate skilled bullet hell fan for casual playthroughs. A very good 8 dollars spent in the steam store."

Still a good game, and I love the difficulty regardless of the bits of frustration here and there."
,Recommended,281860,20591006,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,Deight,This is one of my favourite Shoot em ups. (Best shooter I played since Arrow Flash for the Sega Mega Drive.)It's  easy to learn but hard to master. Mastering the reflection ability is so rewarding.At first I thought it was unfair that you had to start over from the beginning when you had a game over. But after a while I found out that I was getting better and better at the game because of this design choice and know I'm glad they did choose for a 'real' game over because that makes finishing this game really satisfying.Long story short if you like old school shooters/Shoot em ups you'll love this game.

Okay, but this can get frustrating to play.This is a fun bullet hell spacey top-down view late 1980's styled arcade shooter which will be fairly familiar to anyone who's played Crimson Clover or Raiden III. However the various weapons systems of your spacecraft can take some getting used to (they are quite a bit more complex than in most other shooter arcade styled games of this kind) and this game is quite a bit more challenging (and can be frustrating) than many other games of this type. The levels and enemies are fairly creative and the action is intense though."

This title deserves to be shown off way more, especially compared to the rest of the competition out there...Reflex is a standard verticle shooter that has top quality gameplay & style, with a pretty unique ""reflection"" mechanic and great atmosphere to boot with its retro inspired PS1 graphics its a real treat on the eyes. The sense of speed is great when present and set pieces are quite enjoyable too.I can easily recommend to anyone with a twitchy finger, and the skill to tactically respond to your situations via energy meter. With 8 Stages, and quite a lot of sub-bosses, and main bosses and quite a challenge, its quite the intense challenge indeedBeing a standard shooter with it being the ""prequel, sequel"" to Kamui (1999) part of a trilogy from Jap known as ""Alltynex"". With an epic almost destopian orchestrated techno soundtrack pounding your speakers its a rush you should really should probably give a chance if you have ANY common decency for yourself.I'd give it a 9/10.If you have the measly 7 dollars, do your life a favor and improve it, with Reflex (2008).The games sick yo !"
