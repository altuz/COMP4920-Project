If you are into this genre/type of game this is areally strong one. Not one performance or bug issue. Seems totally clean and playable. A Fast action and methodical top-down shooter."

The story is pretty good compared to most of the games in this genre and I found myself laughing a lot at some of the dialogue between characters, game difficulty is also challenging (I've completed it on normal so far) and plan to go back in on the higher settings. Keep in mind the story is 4-6 hours long but the quality of the content alone is more than worth it!."

It is a clever, funny, brutal, bloody tactical action shooter with RPG-esque bits (leveling your weapons), boss fights, and a story. If you like this type of game, buy this.

Maniac difficulty next, you will unlock it after finishing the game.Top-down shooter, plays like you'd think it shuold. Only thing that bothered me in this was how the screen went black and white when my health was down. It made enemies sometimes hard to see, and my cursor was lost there as well because there's a lot happening at times on the levels. Other than that, it was a cool effect. Few deaths because of the unclear screen, but nothing too annoying.That's pretty much the only complaint i have for game. The levels are interesting, they're not too linear, contain secrets (Yes, i am a sucker for hunting secrets in games). Weapons can be upgraded with money you find in the levels (and you guessed it, at the secrets!). Upgrading system is simplistic, you can only buy another level with money to the weapon. It seemed there wasn't enough money to upgrade all the weapons, which is a nice little touch. You shuold choose 2-3 main ones you will be using, otherwise you will end up with only mediocre weapons and the later stages of the game will be way harder.Cutscenes are drawn like panels in a comic book, strongly reminiscent of Sin City comics. We play as a bit too smart♥♥♥♥♥hero to my liking, but most of the dialoque was positively funny, and seemed to be thought out a bit before starting to make the game. The developer said he was planning to make a sequel, but that idea has been abandoned. Shame, it wuold have been great to have more of this. Especially since the story ended how it ended, shows a sequel was planned.Shuold you buy it?Yes! At 19cents that i paid for it, it's a steal. Quality indie game, cutscenes are great to look at, game is ok fun for 5-8 hours. Survival mode is fun to fire up for a few rounds here and there when you have time to kill."

I stumbled across this game and almost turned a blind eye due to it being 15p! YES! 15p! Now I do casual gaming, but im not an expert. For it's price, even at full amount, this game is an absolute steal. I like the look of top down shooters and this one really doesnt disappoint. I've only invested the last 2 hours into this game, but I was so pleasantly surprised that I thought I better make this game my first review. There is a loose story line, which so far pretty much fits your stereotypical zombie genre. The character you play as is pretty badass and the level blood and guts is there with every kill. I've played Hotline Miami recently and thoroughly enjoyed it, this has a similar feel to it, but with more enemies, leveling up and combined with a great looking backdrop. This review might not help the hardcore gamer, but for people relatively new to steam and indie games, this is the kind of stuff you're looking for, in fact, for 15p this is what everyone is looking for!"

You start your game with a small variety of weapons but as you advance more and more weapons will become available as well upgrading the ones you already own.Considering its very low price it ended being quite a nice surprise. The story may now be remarkable and the main character often feel cheesy from my own perspective but in the end what matters is that the game feels satisfying to play. It's easy to start and it will leave you curious thinking what's happening in the next location or if the people from a certain village will survive or not.The game can be finished in less than 5 hours but its lenght will depend on what difficulty you are playing. If you want more out of game after completing the main story there is also an arcade mode to test your skills and compete for your spot in the leaderboards as well local co-op for you to enjoy with your friends."

Splatter is that game that is exactly what it sets out to be. It's simple, top-down-Postal-style fun. The character is cheesy in an endearingly 90's way. He wears a trench coat & Fedora for the sake of being what it is. His lines with his style do add an immense sense of humor to the whole thing, but the whole game is like that.Splatter gave me that feeling of a classic action movie. Goofy, over-the-top & overall completely worth a play and a New Game+. Yes, if you beat the game it does continue as a ""New Story"" with a New Game +.I don't need to say a lot of things about it for it do its job. That is the best part. Splatter is clean, old-fashioned zombie killing fun at a reasonable price that you can play as long as you want without really getting bored.I have no flaws to really pick at it other than I wish it was a bit longer, there were some typos here and there and the sound design can be a bit overbearing.I really wish a sequel would come out because actually it really reminded me of the Decision Series of Zombie Flash games all over the web. I want to see it really be a bigger & better game.Really enjoyed it; 8/10Length: Short (2 to 4 hours)"

I had it on and was topping at 20FPS, turned it off and went up to a steady 60FPS throughout the entire game. Aside from that it was a good game. Plays like a top down twin stick shooter and feels like a resident evil game with the atmosphere, the monsters and even the cheesy dialogue. Although once the story mode is over, there is not much to go back on. There is survival mode where you take on hordes of zombies and monsters but it gets repetitive after a while.

Worth every cent.The story goes around your typical zombie infestation, starred by a cynical yet handy guy. Nothing special about him, except for the interesting interactions and ocasional collaborations with other AIs. The story is good and makes sense. Overall is a very good fast-paced game. Fast, fluid and fun to stress out for a while. Repeatable, specially the arcade modes, to get high scores.The easy mode is piece of cake, but funny if you want to cause maximum damage.

You get a good variety of enemies, weapons, and scenarios. Sometimes you get to operate a car, or rescue distressed civilians, or defend settlements. If you like to just destroy stuff, this is really fun.The graphics are not ""amazing"" but they get the job done. Despite the dark ambience, you can mostly see things clearly -- except when you're clearly not supposed to. Though games like these tend to be dreary, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of colour. The cutscene graphics, however, are cringeworthy. More on that later.One thing I love about this game is that it runs on a variety of hardware. If you have any PC made within the past 5 years, whether Windows, Mac, or Linux, you'll be able to run this game fine. Trust me, in addition to my plethora of Windows hardware, I also own a Thinkpad T440p running Ubuntu as well as a MacBook Air (2015). The game works on all of them.This game also has full controller support, but with games like these, you're far better going mouse and keyboard. Sure, you could wield double analog sticks, but the real fun is with pointing at the enemies and laying them to waste.Not all is good, however. The in game art style is great but the cut scenes are ""fedorable"". For some reason, the designers thought a shadowy man holding a fedora over his head looks cool but all I could think of was Neckbeard RPG. There's also lots of spelling and grammar problems in the subtitles, and the voice acting is over the top. If you like ""so bad it's good"" B-movies, maybe you'll like this, but I don't think it goes well with the game.Still, the cutscenes are skippable. The real meat of the game is the overhead shooting. And in that, Splatter succeeds very well.Overall rating: 3.5/5"

,Recommended,281920,10413787,"Posted: 9 June, 2014",all,Goldenkitten,"Splatter is a brilliantly crafted top-down shooter that mixes the best of the genres game mechanics with a solid story straight out of a (purposefully) B-grade zombie movie. It operates on a simple concept; did you ever want your top-down to be less pure action and more gloomy ambience and storytelling? If you said yes then Splatter is for you, but if you said no you should probably move on as a large part of the game is devoted to telling a story and building an air of tension.Pros- Tight controls.- Varied Weapons.- Progressive weapon upgrades.- Incredibly rich and engrossing ambiance.- Deep story (for the genre) that even includes optional bits.- Solid length (around 6 hours) with extensive replayability (and achievements for those that care) .- Good soundtrack.- Leaderboards (again, for those who care).Cons- Dumb enemy AI is dumb (but made up for with intelligent level design that takes advantage of their usual blind charge).- Some weapons are blatantly better, meaning some sit about and are never used.- While the graphics themselves ARE nice, I’m not fond of the film-noir filter that grey-scales your surroundings.- Unstable difficulty flailing between painfully easy and crushingly difficult (mostly notable on the hardest difficulty during “defense” missions).In short the positives the game has are far greater than its negatives and it’s definitely worth your time. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre, especially if they’re also fans of the super cheesy but fun classic zombie movies. With good gameplay, a fun story, and a high degree of replayability anyone with a passing interest in the genre will get their monies worth and an experience to remember."

,Recommended,281920,33365270,Posted: 7 July,all,Setari,"So I'm going to write an extensive review for this, because I believe these devs deserve some more money than they're selling this game for. More than 0.49 cents USD anyway.Gameplay:Gameplay is typical run n' gun gameplay, top down. I don't normally play top down shooters but they did a pretty great job with this one. There are several guns to collect throughout the game as well as secrets hidden in every level, and they do a pretty good job of hiding them too. I've only played a little bit so far but from what I have played, it's pretty good. The weapon upgrades actually help you fight the larger hordes of zombies that are constantly coming at you. There is also pretty decent enemy variety, runners, large zombies, LARGER ZOMBIES, and at the end of my session tonight I ran into zombies shooting fireballs.These aren't the typical Romero zombies or 28 Days Later zombies, they're from a chemical spill or something like that, so I'll give them a pass to use any kind of zombie they really want to at that point. Zombie origins are everything!Shooting mechanics are great as well and with the wide variety of guns, it's pretty fun to be able to switch guns on the fly to gun down a LARGE zombie with a grenade launcher, dodging their shockwaves of them hitting the ground and switching to the pistol for the small fry. I am extremely thankful the pistol has infinite ammo and is upgradeable as well (At least on the easiest difficulty, I don't know about the other ones).  Also, there's no reloading mechanic, which is great for a game like this. Seriously if that mechanic was in this game it'd be 100% harder even on the difficulty I'm playing on.Sound: Sound in the game is fantastic, as is the voice acting in my opinion. Though I pretty much like any voice acting unless it's REEEEEEEEEALLY bad, so. The explosions from explosive barrels sound great as well as car explosions actually being rattling when they happen. Also gun sounds are great.Characters and Storyline: The storyline in the game is not rushed per se but it shoves you into the role of this dude chilling in his house, when he hears a guy yelling ""STOP,"" etc and then a zombie busts through your front door and the SWAT guy shoots it. It goes from there pretty much just the character being on the run from the zombies (Not sure if the character has a name, if he does, I forgot it). There's some pretty interesting parts in the story so far, and from the weapon upgrades I'm getting, I'm pretty sure I'm barely into the game yet, but we'll see I suppose. The characters are very well voiced IMO and are worth listening to, they did a good job with voicing and the slight character development of the NPCs, of the limited time you're with them, and the character development of the main character, what there is anyway. He's pretty much already solidified as a ""man's man"" mentality but it keeps in character, which I can appreciate.Well, generally I think that's it so I do recommend this game if you're looking for a fun time waster that's a zombie shooter. IMO, it is worth full price just from what I've played so far. The only gripe I have with the game is that in some of the levels the area is hard to navigate around, but that may be just my eyes tbh, all the levels are actually open and explorable for secrets and stuff, didn't run into any bugs so 9.5/10 game from me. Graphics aren't everything, kids."

Other reviews are used to help stress my point across but are changed in such a way to make the review in my own wordingSplatter - Zombie Apocalypse or Blood Red Edition is a game developed and published by DreamworldsWhile the game feels a tad short, Splatter is just what it promises: a top down shooter with plenty to kill and some people to help or not along the wayConsidering its very low price it ended being quite a nice surprise. The story may be a bit exaggerated and the main character often feels cheesy from my own perspective but in the end what matters is that the game feels satisfying to playThe game can be finished in less than 5 hours depending on your chosen difficulty.

Even the launcher crashes sometimes out of no where. Launcher did however randomly give me a free key to the game Polarity, which I accepted though I have no want for.

It has hints of SAS Zombies and a bit of Zombie Shooter, but the story! Oh god where to begin.The game is brutally difficult, even on the normal setting. You'll be rewarded for exploration and secret-hunting, like if you get the 8 golden gun parts you won't need to spend money on upgrades.Each gun has 4 upgrades, which cost 300, 500, 750, and 1000 each. Looking for money is very useful.The zombies and various creatures are afraid of flares, and some weapons can be upgraded to use tracer rounds and magnesium bullets to startle them.The boss fights are incredible, i'e played at least 3 hours so far and I'm not even near to finishing all the upgrades and modes, but I think the campaign is 5 hours long but there's tons of bonus modes i haven't even gotten intoThe game is very gory and actually quite good looking. it reminds me of the graphics from the upcoming title, The Hong Kong Massacre, and at max settings it works flawlessly and looks fantastic.Along the way you'll be forced to make moral choices, most of these are just side missions but they are always quite rewarding and sometimes they are the only way to get all the upgrade parts and secrets.The game is worth the 9 bucks you spend and honestly I've enjoyed this game about as much as Hotline Miami and even more than alien/zombie shooter thanks to the in-depth story, great voice acting and cutscenes and the white-hot shooting.The only downside to this game is the amount of time you will waste playing it, and the difficulty. The game, I'm assuming, can be played multiple times and there's even a hotseat 4-person coop, and survival modes. The combat is fierce and you will die in 4 hits from zombies most of the time.Honestly? I'm very, very glad I got this game. I play mostly fps games and this was exactly the something different I was looking for. If you're into shooting games and want something as intense as Killing Floor with the story of, say, Max Payne, then you'll probably love this game."

While surfing my library I happened to see it and gave it a try. I gotta say, I really love it.It's probably my favorite twin stick shooter. Too many games just use arena or survival formats, this one has a plot, objectives and secrets a la Doom style. The graphics are also pretty great in my opinion for a game of this type.Two things I especially love about this game is that #1: There is a lot of variety. Almost every level introduces a new enemy, sometimes a new mechanic or a new weapon, which leads me to #2: None of the guns seem redundant. Every weapon is useful in certain situations. You're not gonna upgrade the heck out of one gun and use it the entire game, you'll be switching on the fly. Upgrades themselves are great too. Overall, I bought it at 4.90 USD and I'd say it was worth it, let alone now on sale for under a dollar.Also there is multiplayer, I haven't tried it yet so I can't comment on that.The only con's I can think of is that (one time for me) you can get stuck between objects and get trapped. Again, it happened once for me so it might have been a one time thing. Either way my autosave brought me back a whole five minutes so no big deal. Second is that flares seem a bit OP and you get a ton of them, but that's my opinion, plus I'm playing on normal and not hard. Third... lol the voice acting is horrendous. The main character does an okay job, but every NPC is laughably bad.PS: Almost forgot to mention, the sounds effects are awesome. From the gunshots and explosions to the various creatures moans and screams and explosive gory deaths. At .50 you'd be silly not to pick this up. Even if you, for some reason, don't like it... it's .49 cents..."

I wish I would've known when it first came out. I paid around $3.50 for it and it is worth every penny. The graphics are dark and dreary (in a good way) with good lighting and the game has really cool effects, especially when you kill something and it splatters, hence the game's name. The noir cut scenes are cool and the gameplay is smooth and so are the controls. Apparantly at one point the game did not have autofire but the devs fixed it so that holding down right trigger autofires now, otherwise I would be giving this a 0/10 and wouldn't be playing it as to not have a broken hand. Games like Hammerwatch should take a hard lesson from this game and have a proper autofire. I highly recommend using a xbox 360 controller which is a must for a twin-stick shooter type like this.The only real complaint I have is that sometimes during gameplay and especially during a lot of the cut scenes, the characters voices are way too low and without the subtitles you wouldn't even be able to hear them over the sound effects going on during the cut scenes.Other than that, to cut things short, highly recommended. Oh and it's about 5 hours long or less. Probably 4 or less considering I spent some time sitting at the menu one day while I was downstairs."

If you're a fan of the genre, I'd say definately pick it up full price!The plot is linear, but it draws your attention enough so you want to keep playing to see what's up next. Although the plot is linear, the gameplay is not: sometimes you can make choices, even though they are minimal, and also can take on sidequests for some extra cash or ammo/loot -- there are not a lot of sidequests, but they are there to be completed.Enemy variety is not abundant, however, I think I like it that way; I mean, c'mon, it has zombies and its mutations and also some animal-ish mutations for good matter, what more can you want for a zombie shooter?Arcade survival mode is self-explanatory, always fun for some casual mindless shooting.I can say the game is polished enough, but there was one problem that made things difficult for me and even got me killed once. It started happening on the later stages: lightning effects issues. At first, it was just some crazy lightning effects -- like near a flame; but then it got to the point where I'd be in a dark room and my flashlight wouldn't work whatsoever! It's hard to explain, but the problem basically is: sometimes the game won't activate your flashlight because it thinks you're on a bright area, but you're not. You can see that's a glitch because, for the most part, the lightning effects are pretty satisfying for your eyes, but for the later stages, you might often see your character on a dark place without his flashlight on and some weird lightning effect dancing on your screen. Although that can get you killed, it's not a game-breaking issue by any means.That glitch aside, game's awesome. Acquiring and upgrading weapons is satisfying; shooting zombies is relaxing and fun. It's a good casual fun for fans of shooters and zombies."

The weapon are plenty although what's weird is you never have to reload so the game just hold trigger and shoot. Still there enough of it to enjoy as there different areas and they play with lighting and give you noir feel. for the price it's nice.
,Recommended,281920,33321911,Posted: 6 July,all,Slappington,"*YES is conditional on sale price -- Game is worth $0.50, not $5.00.The cutscenes are like a low-rent Max Payne and don't fit at all with the rest of the game, which plays like a modern Smash TV with poor lighting. Speaking of lighting, it's terrible. Glitches abound, leaving some areas of the map pitch-black even if you're pointing your ""flashlight"" at them, or ending in weird horizontal artifacts.The gameplay is fun enough. I mean, it was 50 cents on sale, so what is there really to complain about at that price? You'll probably get an afternoon out of it. Lots of explodey-bits, and the physics of destroying certain walls and obstructions is neat. But honestly, it's Flash-caliber and there's just nothing special about it. Nobody should be spending $4.99 retail on it, that's absurd."

Imitates fatigue and makes enemies harder to see.)+Enemy Variation (New enemies present themselves mostly without introduction. being caught off-guard feels really nice in a top-down shooter.)+Destruction and Gore (so good)+Item Upgrades and Golden Weapons (supports those that want to adventure into buildings instead of following the progression arrow.

,Recommended,281920,33512773,Posted: 13 July,all,Rascilon,"Splatter - Zombie Apocalypse hits all the right notes for me.  It is a straight to the point top down twin stick zombie shooter.    What I appreciate most about the game is the inclusion of a casual difficulty level that makes it an accessible game for short play sessions.  The graphics are serviceable and appropriately gory.  The inclusion of trading cards and steam achievements, combined with the low price make this game a good buy for fans of casual games.  My only complaint about the title is the controller support could be improved.  While the controller does work, there are no on screen prompts and menu selection can be a bit wonky with the controller sticks.  Lastly, the steam overlay is supported making it easy to take and share screenshots on the steam playform.  For it's genre I would give the game a 4 out of 5."

And the gore is pretty neat too. Guns are not as punchy as I would like but still are fun to shoot. The upgrade system leaves a bit to be desired too, tho it works and I feel the amount of money found on the maps is pretty spot on to make you feel ya need to scrounge to get every penny.I'm currently about two hours in on the campaign and enjoying the cheesy noire storyline and the main protaginist's comments in game.

Crappy story.Pros:Decent enemy variety: each enemy has an attack pattern (my favourite ones are the toadmen)You can mow down zombies with a threshing machine.Combat is fairly nuanced with different weapons fitting different situations.Advanced weapons have meaningful upgrades and feel satisfying to use.Gallons of blood and  hordes of enemies.The campaign manages to stay fresh thanks to sidemissions, a decent amount of exploration, various environments. It also introduces newer game mechanics (like fireflies) the more you progress into the game.When he's not trying to sound grim and somber and instead just acts all snarky, the main character is actually quite likable/funny.Graphically the game looks good enough with nice lighting effects, even though character models aren't great.Cons:Voice acting and story are utter trash. They are on the same level of the Alien Shooter series. You really don't care  about the other NPCs and are likely to skip their dialogues.Ammo is rare enough that you will be forced to use your basic pistol a lot. The pistol has infinite ammo and is somewhat efficient at killing most enemies. The problem is that it's just not that fun to shoot with.When your HP is low enough your view gets grayed out, until you find some (rare) health-pack. This is obnoxious because you can't see jackshit in this mode.The basic ubiquitous enemy zombies sport crappy uninspired models, bad animations and are generally unsatisfying to kill.Bosses are infamous bullet-sponges. They really take a million years to die, not fun at all."

,Recommended,281920,32201922,Posted: 5 June,all,hitt.william,"7/10I really enjoyed this title. I won't go into what the game is, as it's really quite straightforward and well-conveyed by the description. I didn't expect to enjoy myself as much as I did, because everything seems so low-budget. The voice acting isn't stellar, and seems to get worse as the game goes on. Some of the graphical assets look like something from the old Windows game ""Chip's Challenge."" However, the game is very stable. I only ran into one glitch in the entirety of my play-through - a worm boss got stuck on a structure in the lower right corner of the map during our fight. However, this just made the boss a little easier, it didn't require any sort of restart to the level or the game.The game makes some very smart design decisions. First of all, the weapon system is solid. Each weapon feels notably different, and changes meaningfully with each upgrade purchase. The game does a pretty wonderful job of creating tension. The music during fights is not especially noteworthy but serves its purpose. The player takes very few hits (especially on the ""Nasty"" difficulty level), and when the player is at low health, the colors (graphically) in the game become washed out. This makes it difficult to discern the environment and the enemies. This serves as an added incentive to avoid taking hits, and makes being at low health more pulse-pounding.There are a few rough difficulty spikes, and the game involved quite a bit of kiting. However, there are a few times the game spawns enemies behind you or puts you in a tight corridor with nowhere to run. Kiting doesn't work in these situations, and you'll need flares and firepower to stay upright. If you're a fan of tense, scary titles, and wouldn't be put off by a low-budget feel, I think you'll find a lot to like here."

Also i really like the ""Max Payne"" -style (and i mean the first one) look on those cutscenes. The protagonist has quite the same voice funnily (his name has some familiarity too ;) ). :D+ It has secrets+ Enough guns and they are upgradable+ No regenerating health, there are healthpacks instead+ Lots of stuff to kill and destroy"
,Recommended,281920,31818014,Posted: 18 May,all,Judassem,"A great little game to kill some time. I work as a teacher and this game was an excellent way to pass some time during the breaks.+ The artwork is quite good, and it's consistent. Nothing stands out in a negative way.+ The action sequences are quite good. They are neither overwhelming nor too over-the-top.+ The game has quite regular checkpoints, so you don't have to play a whole area again when you die.+ The voice-acting is quite good for an indie game. I especially liked the voice actor of our protagonist, Max.+ Very nice, rock/metal-themed soundtrack.+ The game has collectibles (secret locations, golden gun parts and body armor parts); nice for completionists.+ All the weapons have many levels of upgrades, which sometimes changes how they work noticeably.+/- Most games of this kind has a BFG-type weapon they hand out in the end. Splatter gives you all the weapons many levels before the last one, and none of them are truly devastating.+-/ The story was interesting, but not a masterpiece. It was simple enough to follow, but not deep enough to really care.- The variety of weapons is sufficient but you can finish the whole game with just shotgun. It's very effective, and you won't need another weapon if you fully upgrade it. I've almost never used the grenade launcher and the flame thrower.All in all, I can recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a short game to play in quick bursts."

,Recommended,281920,33258251,Posted: 4 July,all,Haxx,Fun little zombie game. Easily worth the price and has a great combination of music/scenary to immerse the player. Story can be a bit confusing though.
,Recommended,281920,33256846,Posted: 4 July,all,And after I called her Mom.,"Fun and satisfying shooter-- the rough-edges of dialogue not always fitting the Noir presentation and controls feeling cumbersome when cornered (which might be by design for punishing ending up cornered...) are easily smoothed over with a good flow of monster killing and secrets exploration.Only major complaint is that switching weapons with the mouse wheel lacks precision after carrying just a few weapons, far too easy to 'scroll too far' or 'why did it swap to that gun',  minor issue that wouldnt deter picking this up."

76561197980156403,Recommended,281920,33914182,Posted: 30 July,all,Csta,"I was very pleased with this little game. I beat it in one sitting at just over 6 hours on the normal setting, which was a perfect length for the story. The music reminded me a little of Diablo. In fact, I would probably categorize the feel of this game as a mix between a zombie apocalypse shooter and a classic hack-and-slash. The weapon upgrades are cool, the ambience is immersive, the action keeps you going, and there's just enough of a hint of a story to tie it all up. There's also just a few side quests along the way to mix things up a bit, but you don't feel like you're getting lost in a long list of side quests. An all around satisfying experience. 10/10"

There are some good puzzles, secrets to find, and it can be relatively challenging at times. Boss battles could be a little more difficult, as they are easy to figure out and beat, but other than that this is a fun little game to kill some hours with for such a small price!"
76561198120746009,Recommended,281920,34752786,Posted: 5 September,all,Rae,"Bought it for 20 cents with a coupon. No expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised.Story and characters are so bad that they are good, gameplay is fun, everything else decent. Some replayability in survival mode. Fun exploding and shooting up  houses through windows. I just wish flares immediatelly showed what is inside a house/room when you throw them in.One very good thing is that it never got repetitive, story mode always mixes something up a bit, even though it's not very long and guns/ upgrades are a bit generic.Also, bonus points for nostalgia- reminded me of the days I used to play Alien shooter on my old Pentium. Though I believe this won't apply for most people :)Overall- good game. Worth the full asking price. With a discount even more so."
,Recommended,281920,34787712,Posted: 6 September,all,bigfooty,"The game is a lot of fun and is an excellent addition to the zombie horde killing mofo with a 'tude genre.   <-- not sure that's a thing.  :P    The graphical effects added throughout the game are pretty cool.  Also a lot of little things here and there that I really appreciated as I was killing everything in sight.  Some of the game play mechanics added in really kept me going too since there were a few times I got frustrated due to ammo, but that's my fault for going all RAMBO-kill-mode on the frog monsters.Totally worth the small asking price and highly recommend if you like games like Alien Shooter or Zombie Shooter.The only things I noticed about the game I could recomend fixing eventually:- It does lock up during start up occasionally, and I believe it's due to the front end screen window slowing the computer down for some reason.  Not sure.  It's like it's trying to adjust the mouse speed or video mode perhaps?- The nerd near the end says ""all looking for a prize"" but it's spelled ""price"" in the text.  Nitpick issue.- It would lock up occasionally between levels or if I alt-tabbed out for a moment.    Might be a windows 10 issue too.That said, none of these stopped me from playing the game and beating the heck out of it.Good game, great price, thanks for making it.  : )"
