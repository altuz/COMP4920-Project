Wicked fun. And you are rewarded for all of this, which makes it even more fun. The game even lets you know how many pedestrians there are on each level, so you can make sure every single one is mangled.There are some old games that I think have really good looking graphics, even though they aren't very realistic like modern games. Carmageddon is one of them. There's a grittiness and personallity to the graphics that new games don't have. The lower detail of the graphics also gives the game a little more challenge, as it can be hard to see things coming up at times (at least before you get used to the graphics}.The game can be annoying at times though. I found the vehicle handling/controls hard to get used to as first. At least with one car, you can easily get stuck to walls, and have to steer into the wall to get free. That doesn't really stop being annoying. Also if you go too fast up a steep hill, you can end up launching off and flying way too far, and will end up needing to be recovered. These minor things don't detract from the fun though.The game has some good music that goes good with the game. There some rock songs and some electronic songs. But if you don't like them or get tired of them, you can always turn on some Metal. Metal goes great with this game.Carmageddon is a lot of fun. If you like games like Postal or GTA. If you like running over people, wrecking cars, and causing chaos, then you will like this game. If you haven't already played it and don't own it, then you should get it now. Or when it's on sale.9.5/10"

They kind of share some similiarties between each of them.If you like adrenaline games such as Unreal Tournament, Quake or Duke Nukem, you may like this if it doesn't bother you to play using cars, and well, perhaps Postal 2? Same kind of mayhem but with cars instead, difference is, this game is pure quality.Fu** yeah!/10   (9.5/.10)"

Cunning stunt bonus. *runs over pedestrian in a special manner* Bonus for artistic impression. *runs over pedestrian in a drift* Extra style bonus. And so on, overall tone is tongue-in-cheek.Gameplay is great fun. Maps are large and every place has something good to find. 3 ways to complete a race, run over all pedestrians, destroy opponents or lastly race through the laps. Even just racing the map can be pretty fun since the maps are pretty wacky.Character roster. Everyone is a freak. And the cars..such great designs, some are plain fictional, rest are real life cars weaponized.Now for what makes me not recommend..Bad release. Doesn't run on atleast a middish resolution, 60 fps right outta the box.

76561197972445514,Recommended,282010,29993987,Posted: 17 February,all,Hellbishop,"To think this game came out in 1997 yet is still so playable and satisfying today with its solid gameplay.CARMAGEDDON is a pure visceral thrill ride of stress venting that leaves me totally relaxed afterwards with its amazing though exaggerated physics system as one crashes into oppenant's racing cars seeing them take physical dents along with falling parts damage from the high speed impact. Its great to see touches of realism like ones engine smoking after taking a headon collision. This same smoke will obscure your vision just enough to make hitting oppenants and pedestrians a bit more difficult but in a fun non frustrating way.Enemy ai is very well done with them giving the illusion of having their own purposes. Sometimes they'll ignore you while going against other racers and other times they'll hunt you down for many a street city block especially if you just bumped into them ""accidently"" :D Pedestrians will scream in terror at your approach and will start running for their stinking lives when they see you racing like a bat out of hell down the street.Graphics are sweet in their brutality. It is quite a joy mowing down an old granny in a walker who reminds you of a certain passive aggressive senior citizen we have all had to deal with. CARMAGEDDON takes the wait out of waiting for the nursing home staff to show up to take them away as they scream in terror before you pile drive them with your race car against a building wall sending guts eyeballs and entrails flying everywhere. Ooo and what a squishy sound they make as i run over their dead bodies afterward. Then theres the sexy boys... ooo i hate sexy boys!Sound effects are top notch from the screeching grind of cars rubbing up against a building to the POW! of crashing into public telephones and street lights. Its a real riot hearing pedestrians death screams when scoring points for killing them along with time bonuses. If one does a fancy move or stunt while killing them one is awarded even more points and or cash. Hearing your character cracking jokes or cursing really adds to the sense of immersion.A timeless classic full of black humor and relaxing venting still absolutely playable and still gives any ""modern"" racing game a run for its money.Thanks Interplay and SCi for the endless fun :D"
,Recommended,282010,31232483,Posted: 19 April,all,CooperTeam,"Ever since the 1990's, when 3D gaming was still an infant, they constantly pushed the boundries of what was possible. Whether it would be a 3D shooter game, racing game, RPG game, or a strategy game, they all played well and looked good.Carmageddon is no exception. Ever since this game came out during teh 1990's, it's been the hottest racing game ever. Not just because it's a racing game, but it's a racing with a challenge as well as having mini goals. You're not just racing to survive, but you're also racing to smack the hell out of as many pedestrians as possible. With the many kinds of odd racing out there, this one is still king (IMHO) as well as started it all.Course, you don't have to just go through all the check points to win the race, just bash the hell out of some other racers and take them out of the race to win. The only challenge is that you don't get much time to do this, as the timer ticks down the longer you are racing.For those who are not familiar with the game, some of the many features include...1.) Gain time by running over people, performing cool stunts, or smacking racers just right2.) Power ups lay all over the race which give you either land mines, extra time, or a spiked tail (Don't ask)3.) Ability to buy vehicles and upgrades as you progress through the game4.) Gain money by winning the race, killing all other racers, smacking peds, or performing stunts5.) Many race tracks and 40+ (Main game + Splat pack) vehicles to choose from6.) Complete open worlds, explore to your hearts content on each race track7.) Peds count ranges from 200+ to 500+ per race track8.) Race hard enough, and earn the super armoured police vehicleAnd so much more. Keep in mind of course that the graphics are not up to par with todays 3D gaming, but then the game is over 20 years old.Overall, a fun killing spree with a feel of a racing game, and with so many cars to choose from, you will want to race even harder to get those vehicles in your list. Race against other racers, slam some peds, and bash other racers out of the way. What more could you want in a racing game?"

However, the Steam port is absolute dogshit. The game only runs with DOSBox and if you choose to play with NGlide, no matter the resolution or graphical detail, you willnot be getting a solid 60fps with drops down to even 20fps regularly. I have a GTX1060 and an i5 4460 and it doesn't matter. It runs like trash. I wouldonlyrecommend this on Steam if you don't mind very low framerates or don'tcare about using DOSBox. It's unfortunate that Stainless hasn't decided to update the compatibility because if they did I could easily wholeheartedly recommend this fantastic game.However, I HIGHLY recommend the port for mobiles. It's practically the Gizmodo port that never came but it runs at 60fps, looks fantastic and plays like a dream even with touch controls. This is the only time ever that I'd recommend amobile game, especially a mobile port. It how now become the definitive version of the game.

,Recommended,282010,26122485,"Posted: 19 October, 2016",all,cyan0s1s,"Carmageddon is a vehicular combat 'racing' game by UK developer Stainless Software released in 1997 to much acclaim for its advanced car damage model and sandbox style freedom and plenty of controversy for its depictions of gory carnage against defenseless pedestrians. This lead to an initially censored release for the UK version with zombies that bled green, the only way it was allowed to be sold until a patch was released later on to restore the original palette. The German version didn't fare much better however and was given robots instead that bled oil. Carmageddon's main inspiration comes from the 1975 film Death Race 2000 and was originally going to be a tie-in game but licensing fell through on more than one occasion, to the point Stainless said stuff it let's just get it out.Carmageddon's a free-for-all race where you're encouraged to do whatever you want whenever you like and there is no restrictions on where you can go or what is considered fair or cheating. Your opponents will often be boring enough to race around the circuit and collect their weak paychecks from the checkpoints scattered about. Your opponents can't actually win anything however and there is no position of your standing in the race on your HUD. That's because you don't have one, and it doesn't matter anyway. What does matter is causing as much chaos as possible by either running down pedestrians, and in creative and gorier ways to net additional credits, and ramming the other cars. Wasting an opponent will give you a lot of credits, and more time than any other activity.There's a timer that counts down at the beginning of each event and all manner of shenanigans will give you extra to allow you to explore the environment at your heart's content. For all manner of juicy bonuses and hidden bonus dosh/time and various PUPs (power-ups in Carma slang) litter the circuit and the outskirts of the race. These can be pretty gosh darned handy, for example complete invulnerability, acme damage magnifier for really putting a dent in your opponents, or pedestrian electro ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ray for 30 seconds. The wacky power-downs however come in a sizable variety and are usually harmless enough, but make your vehicle harder to drive for a short period of time. Pinball mode though is a worthy mention as its especially nasty and you'll want to recover ASAP if you're flung into orbit to prevent reparing serious damage.You cannot actually be wasted yourself (at least in this first installment) but credits earned during the race are often used to repair your car, and repairing and recovering when you're on your roof or side will be happening a lot. So it's crucial to scouring and looting the race as much as possible to get more money to have enough left over at the end of a race. If you lose more than you make during a race and you didn't have much left over to begin with when you began the race your bank will go into a screaming fit and pull the plug, and this constitutes as 'game over' here. Failing a race by running out of time isn't penalizing though and you can simply jump back in and try again. You use credits earned between races to upgrade your car's abilities via APO (armor, power, offensive), which are bare-bones as upgrades come and simply make you more resistant to impacts, more horsepower, and dish out extra abuse when colliding into your opponents.All races are won in three Carma fashions: Kill all pedestrians, waste all opponents, or complete all laps. The latter is reserved for ponces however and won't really give you a whole lot of credits but it's there to sate your particular needs, you weirdo. Murdering every ped is no easy feat however, but most levels usually have a Pedestrian Respawn or two (or three) somewhere and memorizing the locations of these after you wipe out a quarter or two of the population and going back for it can give you an extra edge. Participating in races is also done by a ranking system (which was brought back in Reincarnation/Max Damage) and you start at a lowly 99 with three races to choose from and the penultimate goal is to be number one, along the way will be more challenging environments with more unhinged opponents (and cops in APCs who just refuse to get out of the way). Getting hundreds of thousands of credits an event will move the rank much more (up to 5 increases max or none whatsoever if you're absolute tripe).The player can choose between two drivers at the start and a difficulty determining starting time in a race, credits and bonus time earned from activities and how aggressive your opponents are. It's best to start on 'normal' and see how you fare, and if you're the kind of person who hides under the table during thunderstorms then easy mode should be right up your alley. Max Damage and Die Anna are the main 'heroes' of the Death Race and drive a similar model of car. Max's all-round great Eagle is better suited to rammin' and slammin' however whereas Anna's Hawk is a faster but less strong car. Nevertheless Carmageddon is an early supporter of equality, and all manner of men and women are subjected to the same treatment. Be it behind the wheel or roadkill in the street. Sometimes when you waste a specific opponent you have a chance of stealing and adding it to your collection. Some of these can be very powerful, others not so much. Beating the game will unlock every single one, including those labeled as 'cheat', your reward for being the baddest dude.Visually the game is competent, with adequate detail for the environments, early 3D models for vehicles and props that are well designed and pedestrians are rendered as 2D sprites via digitized actors. Their deaths are often extremely gruesome, easily making this the goriest entry of the series even with later installments featuring 3D peds that can lose their limbs. Sound design is loud and crunchy, and impacts with the environment and opponents feel very raw, and the peds incredibly nasty and satisfying. The soundtrack also features four tracks from Fear Factory's 1995 album Demanufacture in instrumental only form, most fitting choice given the game's militant gameplay in a pseudo-apocalyptic near future world.I have very few complaints with the way this game plays, maybe that it goes on for far too long (36 races) especially if you're trying to do the best you can on each race which can run anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour on average. Late game opponents become real damage sponges if you don't nick a better set of wheels (the Eagle/Hawk just won't cut it even at max stats) and cops are extremely difficult to waste and become very common near the end but if you manage to steal an especially hard to acquire ride in the event 'Blood on the Rooftops' you will know sweet, sweet revenge for all the trouble they were giving you early on and finish the last handful of events with pure bloody malice.Carmageddon is decidedly British in its portrayal of humor, with plenty of tongue-in-cheek jokes, British slang, and raunchiness suited for a mature audience. Which only makes sense given the dev is UK based. There's plenty of pop culture references from the era, akin to games like Duke Nukem 3D (even has a reference to OJ Simpson here too!). This should've been more than enough proof that Carmageddon's intentions were never meant to be mean-spirited or shock jockery (a suggestion to add pregnant women peds was flat out no'd), just the kind of things that make the devs♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves laughing. And you can tell they had a great time putting this game together, a real labor of love. Carmageddon also has an equally humorous and interesting development history if you look into it more. If you think most racing games are too dull and traditional and you want to insert more mayhem in to your driving experience than this game comes as highly recommended! And if you still can't get enough the Splat Pack expansion has even more content to offer. The antidote to all racers.4.0/5"

Great game, obviously graphics, controls and so on are out dated, but still a laugh and a good way to let off some steam. Quite unique (especially in its time) from other racing games. I may be biased in my thoughts from playing it many years ago; nostalgia."
,Recommended,282010,33360735,Posted: 7 July,all,Insetta Sport,"In my opinion, this game is great for those looking for a fun racing game and or some 1990's nostalgia.The gameplay is extremely fun, especially when you start picking up power-ups like ""Acme Damage Magnifier,"" which increases the damage you do to other cars, and ""Solid Granite Car"" which does exactly what it sounds like.A major downside is that, to my current knowledge, there is no free play mode, unlike in Reincarnation and Max Damage. So you can't say ""I want to have nearly unlimited time and credits for this race!"" or something like that.The vehicles are quite an interesting bunch. There's sports cars, trucks, racing cars, hearses and dune buggies, just to name a few. You can unlock some of these vehicles by wrecking them when they are ""Stealworthy,"" although the game doesn't tell you when they are, or, at least not in my play time. Not all vehicles are playable, though. Each vehicle has a damage model.The physics lean on the side of realistic, opposed to arcadey.The damage modeling is hugely advanced for 1997. Some games today don't match up. A major downside is that no parts come off of the car and, sometimes, the car will start to ""tear apart"" and have transparent patches.The vehicle modeling is slightly below average, the car bodies are good but the wheels are blocky. The windows on all vehicles are chromatic, so you cannot see inside. There is an interior view option, but the interior appears to just be a .GIF of the dashboard, pictured inside of the vehicles.The pedestrians, which are the, pun intended, meat and bone of the Carmageddon series, are bitmap sprites. The animation is pretty good all things considered. If you hit a pedestrian, they explode into a pile of pixelated gore.The graphics are average for 1997. Draw distance is a bit close due to the size of the maps.This game is a tricky if you aren't absolutely amazing at racing games. The opponents basically have the mindset of every Grand Theft Auto Online player ever. There are police in big trucks, too, and they compound this. The game also does not give you much time...You start with 1:30 on the clock. If it reaches 0, you lose. Hitting pedestrians, smashing opponents at speed and doing cool stunts gets you more time.The soundtrack is small, but good. It features three Fear Factory songs as well as a few 90s-tacular electronica songs.This game takes some grinding to get through, unless you rack up the credits like a madman. You can gain credits through the same ways as gaining time, as well as going through checkpoints.There is no traffic to my knowledge, just scattered parked and junked cars.The level design is...Well, I haven't really fiddled around enough with racing through the levels to tell you. The maps are decently sized, though.The controls are a bit silly to me. But, then again, I rarely play PC games.The heads up display is lackluster. You have to push a button to bring up the map. Camera is slow to rotate outside of the car, and only shows one of three directions in the interior view. One of the game's gimmicks is the ""Prat Cam,"" where there is a .GIF of your selected player model reacting to how horrible your driving is.Overall, if you can take the mental trousers A.I. and playing the same fun levels over and over again, I absolutely recommend this game."

I think I was familiar with the idea of racing games with weapons, but I'd always thought that racing was an important part of it.In Carmageddon, racing is probably the least important part of the game.The first time I tried it out, I tried running through the checkpoints. Even then, I was aware of how bad I am at games, and wondered at how I'd managed to leave everyone behind. But I kept losing the race because I'd run out of time. Why wasn't I getting time for going through the checkpoints? Was I missing any shortcuts?Then I tried it again, and went off the track...Carmageddon was advertised as a ""vehicular combat game"". There are three ways to win a race. You could try and run through the checkpoints, but you'd still have to find a way to build up enough time to do so. You could fight and ""waste"" your opponents (by ramming into them, or ramming them into something; no ranged weapons here), or by killing each and every one of the hundreds of pedestrians on the map.It's quite clear what the game expected you to do.You gain time by running over pedestrians, damaging and killing your opponents, or running over green barrels scattered (and hidden) off the track. There are various power-ups, also in different coloured-barrels, which range from the very useful (solid granite car, electro-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ray), to the weird (instant handbrake, giant pedestrians) to the terrible-but-in-a-fun-way (bounce-bounce, jelly suspension). You can repair your car at any time, but it costs you money, money which you'd earned by running through checkpoints, killing pedestrians, killing opponents, or doing weird things like flipping your car several times off of track geometry (cunning stunt bonus).Money can be used between races to upgrade your car in three areas, offence, defence and speed. I think that the upgrades apply to all of the cars in your garage, but I'm not entirely sure. To be honest, I'm still not sure how cars were unlocked. Every once in a while, a car that you wasted will become unlocked for you to race around in, but I'm pretty sure it was random. Not every car is unlockable, so no Countslash, no De'Gory'Un. Sorry. In later games, you could buy them out, but here you just get them randomly, and it's only a small portion of them.You start out with a choice between two cars and drivers, Max Damage with his Eagle, and Di Anna with her Hawk, cars which look similar, but had different stats and different engine placements. Di Anna, I felt, had an unfair advantage, because you'd have less to repair after every crash since her engine was well out of the way during the various head-on collisions you'd go through.The music is by, according to the wiki, Fear Factory, which explains why it sounded so familiar. No lyrics, but it is loud and heavy.It still looks pretty good for a DOS game. Yes, this game is in DOS, and Steam runs it in DOSbox. It runs very smoothly, even (or rather, especially) the 3DFX version. You wouldn't think you were running a 20-year-old game. The damage-model is especially nice, with different areas of the car deforming from impacts and crashes.I wonder why all of my favourite games were open world and had extensive damage models? Something to think about...The feel of the car isn't very racing game-ish. Modern racing games are very sensitive about grip and drifting, but Carmageddon is a bit... floatier? Not sure if that's right. The cars will skid around, and different surfaces will be treated differently, but it really isn't a racing game. It's not bad, but after something like Mantis Burn Racing (or even Gas Guzzler Extreme), you can tell that this isn't a hardcore racer.I got Carmageddon Max Pack free when I bought Carmageddon Max Damage. It's still downloading, so I thought I'd give this old thing a whirl. It holds up pretty well, I'm just not sure if you should buy it. I got it for free, so I'm happy, though I'm not sure if I'll play it if I have the newer, prettier version around. I got them both for USD 5.00, and I'm surprised that this bundle wasn't advertised more heavily.Download it for your tablet or mini-PC, Carmageddon is a part of gaming history. Just don't pay too much for it."
,Recommended,282010,34400682,Posted: 21 August,all,Blunder Sunder,Make sure to download the Win95RPP pack and use something like xpadder to hook up your gamepad - and quite frankly I think Carmageddon gives racing games released in 2017 a run for their money.- Great art style- Great music- Actual driving physics- Varied vehicles- Varied tracks- Vehicle damage- Open world style gameplay with places to exploreThe live-action reaction portrait is something that every game needs. I'm not sure why this died out with Doom and Carmageddon :(Honestly once you have the high res and gamepad up and running Devolver Digital could release this today and it'd be a hit - it's not just a nostalgia trip.
