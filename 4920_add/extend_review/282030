,Recommended,282030,30754010,Posted: 26 March,all,CorvusCorax,"Back then, roughly 20 years ago this game was huge. I mean HUGE! 3D games were generally ugly - we could see this was the future but controlling a soccer player in FIFA with its almost cube-shaped head was not very promising. Carmageddon was the same: it looked acceptable but its fun came from the gameplay itself (not from the graphics) as it was all about causing mayhem and destruction.Carmageddon is not your typical racing game. A race can be completed by doing the usual laps in the given time OR you can eliminate your opponents by crashing into them OR you can kill all pedestrians (often more than a thousand in a level) by carrying out some well-timed hit-and-runs. Even better are the many power-ups that help you in doing so. Kangaroo jumps allow you to quickly escape just before the enemy hits you head-on, lightning can be cast to kill those civilians that cannot be reached by you and you can even turn yourself into a granite car that destroys even the biggest trucks that join the race.Back to the graphics a little bit: its 3D engine was amazing at the time (in fact, it was ahead of its time). Due to the accidents you have and the hits you receive your car slowly deteriorates. You can see the falling debris and after a while your car behaves in a different way. If there's an issue with the wheels steering is more difficult. The game tries to match real-life scenarios in these cases - such car behaviour is completely normal (in fact, it is a must-have) nowadays but this was back in 1998!!!Stages are grouped together: there are always 3 races (objectives can be completed in the already mentioned ways) but there's a 4th and last mission that requires a little finesse from your end. For instance, some civilians hide in the control tower of an airport. You immediately see the ramp taking you up but it is not aligned well so it is impossible to enter the building this way. No worries - landing atop you can find a kangaroo jump power-up that allows you to make an entrance (perfect timing is almost a must, therefore, this mission remains just as aggravating).I wanted to see if this game runs under Win 10 and I was glad to see that it does so. In fact, it has a config file that allows us to pick one of the many modern day resolutions. But that's all there is regarding any graphic enhancements (for the rest mods can be utilised). Unfortunately, the game's metal soundtrack does not play and this is a Win 10 issue - be sure to check the community forum for a solution.Carmageddon 2 is a blast! It is also the best in the series - while number 3 looked even better they picked a darker theme and pedestrians were replaced by zombies. Some of you have probably tried the new games (let's call them remakes) that were released in recent years. I have yet to see these - until then this game is perfect for a bit of nostalgia."

In reality this is just a really lazy upload of the game to Steam, without fixing any of the games problems. Sounds still don't play sometimes, the music STILL hasn't been patched to work without the cd, and the ped animations are still broken on windows xp onwards. Even basic functions such as changing resolution still require modifying the config files. Honestly, this could be a great title to add on Steam if they put even a little bit of effort into it instead of just dragging and dropping the contents of the game CD into Steam. Very rarely do I actually think that I could do a better job, yet I could here."

76561198258445335,Recommended,282030,34315721,Posted: 17 August,all,Samppu,"This game is the most epically entertaining way to waste your readily rather spent hours of a short life. What makes this game good then:- Still pretty nice damage physics. Seriously. Game is nearly two decades old yet has dynamic deformation of cars, no premodeled damage. You can even split vehicles in half, at any angle..and yet even keep driving depending on how you got split. It's also cool how your driving is handicapped by getting damage. If your engine takes damage, car accelerates slower. If powertrain takes damage, your car will start braking randomly inadvertently. If your wheels get damage, they'll wobble and make your car lean constantly to the given side when driving and steering will become harder. If suspension takes damage, your car will steer randomly on it's own.- Crazy physics. Instant stop handbrake powerup? Works even in midair. Gravity is always like on moon.- Freedom. Go at your preferred pace, keeping timer from running out is not hard. Maps are large, with every area atleast potentially accessible. And every place pretty much has something in it, be it APO upgrades, powerups, lots of cash or whatever. Exploration potential to the maximum. Races are completable by either racing through the checkpoints, completing every lap (no need to stay on track and position doesn't matter) which while isn't the focus of game, is actually usually pretty fun since the tracks are just outlandish and interesting. Or, wreck every opponent. Last choice, most time-consuming and difficult to pull off is overrun every pedestrian and animal in the map.- Powerups. They add chaos, fun and variability a lot. Most hilarious timed one is the pinball mode where every movable object, if given enough a prod, launches into a rather unpredictable direction with great force. Yes, this includes every car too. In indoors, this powerup quickly claims many a driver. Then there is for example one that automatically electrocutes any living being in your proximity..on a certain map, the respawning of this powerup has MASSIVE quick and easy cash hoarding potential.- Variety of vehicles. In late game, it goes nuts. Combine, trucks, and then more everyday car types but adorned with all a manner of attachments for weaponization.What sucks:Cars in average are sadly more race-bred in carma2, I really don't like that. Carma 1 had perfect theme and feel.Pedestrian sounds are stock sfx..the male screams are especially cringy to hear over and over. While carma1 had great sounds for pedestrians.The missions."

After playing the first game a title like ""Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now"" had to be amazing;and it was for that time,I loved it. But if you're thinking about it right now and if you compare this one with the first game it's not that great. Yes the graphics were improved,there are some other missions that are not about racing and smashing cars,a lot more power ups and the most important one you can now buy other cars instead of randomly get them. But let's take the bad things:1. The ""dark"" theme of Carmageddon was gone.2.The main menu looks bad compared to the one from the first game.3.What in the name of God happened to the Eagle? That car used to look badass.4.Some of the new time missions are hard as f without cheating.5.Some of the ""big"" car models were glitchy and almost impossible to play with.But after so many hours of entertainment playing this game as a child I simply can't rate this bad.  Maybe is the nostalgia or maybe the game was not that bad afterall."

76561198027872398,Recommended,282030,12272388,"Posted: 28 September, 2014",all,mircyn87,"What makes this game more enjoyable to play than Carma 1 is its physics and vehicles' damage model. Cars feel lighter and more fragile in Carmageddon 2 - they're bending, losing parts, flying around swirling, splitting in half - it's ridiculous. It is so much fun to destroy your opponents.Missions, in my opinion, are a nice addition for people who like a challenge, but I have to agree that some of them can be really hard and frustrating. Keep in mind that the higher difficulty level you chose, the less time you get to finish them. I managed to beat them on hardest difficulty setting except the last one, which I theoretically beat on medium by editing the game files and adding myself those extra seconds.While a lot of people praise Carma 2's soundtrack, I'm not a big fun of it and I usually play with music turned off. Iron Maiden while great and all, gets boring pretty fast. I liked the first game's soundtrack a lot more. Back in the day I even used to play the game with Carma 1's disc in the drive so it would play its audio tracks.I highly recommed this game. It still holds up. It's still fun to play. Buy it."
,Recommended,282030,28128747,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,cyan0s1s,"Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now is the sequel to the vehicular combat 'racing' game by Stainless Software, using a modified version of the BRender engine for native hardware support out of the box in addition to a software renderer and was released in 1998, one year after the original game. If you haven't read my review for Carmageddon Max Pack and assume this is just another action racing game I'd highly recommend doing so as it covers the fundamentals of the game in greater detail as this review will focus on what's new in C2. But for a brief recap for the sake of convenience, there are three ways to win a race: Complete all the laps, waste all your opponents, or kill every pedestrian, the choice is yours. Of noteworthy interest, C2 is not a direct sequel to C1, but a reboot of sorts set in a more modern day environment (1998) with more traditional looking race cars with a macabre twist to their design, unlike the Mad Max inspired direction from the first game. As such the overall presentation and theme of C2 is slightly lighter in tone than C1.Carmageddon 2 introduces several new elements to the series: First off, your vehicle can now be wasted in the single player game, which wasn't unusual in multiplayer, but here it really changes the way you play. Carmageddon is an often unpredictable and chaotic experience, and the tension only rises further at the risk of failing a race. Not because you ran out of time, but because you got wasted in the numerous ways possible. Whether you split your vehicle in half driving into a corner, or you were made the filling in a truck and building sandwich. This demands a less reckless, more skillful play style in order to win in a race now, and at worst frustration when you've spent a long time on a race only to lose all progress made on it because you collided too hard with that light pole.More controversial however, was the inclusion of missions, which differ heavily from the traditional Carma formula of three-ways-to-win races. Unlike races, you cannot gain any additional time in a mission by killing peds or wasting opponents (if present), instead you are forced to complete your objectives in the quickest manner possible with the least amount of mistakes. This will undoubtedly result in a first time failure and require replaying a mission over at least once in order to memorize the layout and plan your approach. Most missions aren't too difficult, but some can be especially fiendish (don't feel bad if you have to look up a video solution for Control Freak).The game's levels are now setup in groups, with three races and one mission each, unlike C1's ranking system. Ten groups in all, totaling 29 races and 11 missions (2 missions in the last group, even though one isn't labelled as such). Unlike C1's ranking system you can replay a race in the group you're in as many times as you want, instead of being forced down a ladder as your rank increases from credits earned. However, in order to move onto the next group you have to complete the mission of that group. There's around ten environments in total to visit, more or less on par with C1 but boast a greater variety, from the cities and countryside akin to C1 to the fairgrounds and airports of C2.Pedestrians are now full 3D models compared to C1's sprites, and while this results in a loss of graphic intensity of C1's nastily animated deaths the 3D peds are more easily manipulable and a whole host of new ped-related Pups can further manipulate their form and function. Gorier still is their ability to lose limbs, making splatter bonuses particularly satisfying. They're also slightly easier to mow down this time as they often stop in place for a moment to scream right before being plowed through. There's also many more animals this time, which you can now turn off if you're squeamish about roadkill.Opponents are no longer stealworthy and must be purchased at the end of a race or mission, provided they were wasted. They're not cheap, so save your credits for the ones you really want. Some can be very handy in later races and during specific missions (hint: the Bugga has excellent traction, better suited to racing than fighting). Opponents, as well as the player, can also be crushed under certain circumstances or split in two from sharp collisions. Wasting an opponent has never been more satisfying.Further featured is the inclusion of user operable Pups, a since series standard. These differ from ordinary instant-use Pups in that they can be stored for later use and triggered at the player's discretion. Many affect peds and opponents like the new ped flamethrower or opponent repulsificator, making your job easier, and several others grant useful player-specific additions like performing jumps with your vehicle via kangaroo ability or providing increased acceleration with afterburner, handy for a getaway or delivering the final finishing blow to an opponent. Toggling afterburner also cancels out the negative effects of some instant-use Pups like jelly suspension or hot rod, so experiment!APO is also handled differently from C1 as there is no parts shop this time around, you'll have to do all your upgrades on the fly using the del, end and pgdn keys like in the MP portion of the first game. In addition there is APO parts scattered and hidden around the levels that provide immediate upgrades or additional spare slots for future installments. There is 30 slots in total and you begin the game with a few already filled in.Finally, there is the inclusion of a mini-map in the bottom corner of the screen allowing immediate knowledge of closest mission objectives, laps, whereabouts of opponents and ped places (via the peds shown on map Pup once acquired). There is also an opponent status bar at the bottom of the screen showing the condition of your opponent's vehicle and their state of mind, which is a bit more handy than you'd think.Visually, C2 looks OK for the time, though its early 3D hasn't exactly aged as well as C1's IMO. There's blurrier textures and lower res assets in general, though overall environmental detail is slightly higher in C2 and vehicle destruction is also higher. Sound design is practically straight from the first game, re-using many of the same sounds, in addition to some new ones. Peds scream at all times once spooked, as the updated engine keeps track of more things going on now, even out of the player's view, which can cause some annoying noise pollution. C2's soundtrack features four tracks from Iron Maiden and another four from a group called Sentience. It's nothing special, and I prefer my own soundtrack.I have more complaints regarding C2 than C1. The inclusion of permadeath can be insanely annoying and Stainless knew this was a bad design decision later on, ditching it in favor of C1's system for the new Carma. The missions can also be frustrating to newcomers and fans of C1 and C:MD, requiring mastering the vehicle handling and other aspects of the game to win them. Cops were also cut from the game due to time constraints, despite showing up in a mission once. Collision detection with breakables can be bizarre at times, with windows and fences that sometimes break and sometimes don't. Gravity from jupiter Pup vs. certain elevations in the ground could also potentially waste you out of nowhere, among other countless collision problems with certain vehicles and objects. There's also a rare but serious bug that can result in the last opponent of a race being unreachable as they teleport around the map, forcing you to finish the race in another way.Overall, C2 is a lot less polished than C1 and was rushed by Stainless' old publisher SCi for release and it shows at times. But at the end of the day it's essentially just more of the same with a few new and essential improvements and is still good fun to play at times. Recommended to fans of the original and the series in general. Hang on to yer helmet.3.0/5"

,Recommended,282030,34561163,Posted: 28 August,all,Peksi Sarvinen,"It was less than a year ago, the last time I played Carmageddon 2 all the way through. It was pretty amazing how much fun it still was, despite obviously showing (and feeling) it's age. If you haven't played Carmageddon 2 before, you probably shouldn't. The driving physics are absolute ***. The game is hell of floaty, the cars spin out of control at the slightest provocation, and most of the time races descend into you pushing overturned opponents around, trying to hit trees and buildings to make them explode.The difficulty curve is horrible. Some of the races and challenges are ridiculously easy, while some of them are just absurdly difficult (the airport tower challenge springs to mind). Most of the cars are completely useless and a downgrade from the initial one, so there's no real reason to buy any cars before you get to the really big stuff. The soundtrack consists of like four songs, most of which are absolute classics like Aces High and 2 Minutes to Midnight, but there's STILL only four of them, and no way to add your own as far as I know.The enjoyment one gets out of this game nowadays is mostly built on nostalgia and tolerance for shoddy game mechanics older folk like myself possess. But for people who used to play the hell out of this back in the late 90's, I'd say it's still absolutely worth the money and time.The levels are as expansive and varied as you'd like. The car designs are also varied and interesting, if not exactly useful. There are tons of secrets to be found, and the meat and potatoes part of Carmageddon 2 is still there: the occasional cool moments. The funny things that happen when all the shoddy mechanics combine with the absurd powerups and levels to create the kind of chaotic fun times that few car games since Carmageddon 2 have managed.Carmageddon 2 is sort of like an old escort: hasn't exactly aged gracefully, but while it's age shows, it still knows many of the old tricks that made it famous; tricks that others have long since forgotten."

Regardless of how much time passed or what trends came and go or what movie-like look the games have these days...THIS GAME IS THE♥♥♥♥♥♥Back in time, there were brewtal games around like Doom, Duke 3D or GTA I-II with their morbid sense of humour but not a single game could blow the fuse of the conformists so efficiently like Carmageddon. It was fun and violent and of course developers were heavily criticised. They listened to these voices really seriously when they planned the next move.So, Carmageddon 2 screams a huge ♥♥♥♥ OFF! message for critics and the society in general as it did twice as much of everything that the first game with twice as much gore. Below the actual surface of a gore destruction derby you can find some raw punk - anarchist attitude. If you had any problem with the system, the conformity or hypocrisy of the society, it could easily became your fav game as the main plot is a big '♥♥♥♥ you' message to conformism in general.As far as I know, this game reached a cult status in most of underground rock and metalhead gamers, at least among the ones that I know. We burned months off our lifetimes while playing with each other via LAN. The sandbox-like gameplay and nasty attitude has paved the way for games like GTA III but you can find its attitude in any game that shows a middle finger to conformity.Sure, Carma II looks old and outdated. So what? Wacky and fun physics + causing mayhem never gets old."

But there is no music and the game tends to crash a lot and even crashes when you close the game after done playing. But despite that, the game is a classic. I use to love playing it when I was a kid but this game doesnt have the grittyness like the first game had, but for me I rate Carma2 a 7/10  This game is worth the 10 bucks!"

,Recommended,282030,33051866,Posted: 30 June,all,Shiinyu,"Definetly the best of it's kind and it is among the best in the genre itself. One of the grandfathers of 3D vehicular combat, and it's damn good at it! It's a must buy in my opinion, but if you cannot value old games without minding them being slightly dated, i'd recommend waiting for a sale to get the game."
