It feels dated, the controls are bad, the physics are so far off it feels sluggish and sloppy. Before its release, I watched a video where the devs stated the track width was widened to make it easier on new players to the franchise, this is a lie. It was widened because the controls are so sloppy, wonky that pro riders probably couldnt negotiate a tighter track. There are NO features in play for PC, no graphics settings, aside from resolution, and the optimization is worse than♥♥♥♥♥♥poor, its non existant. This whole game was phoned in, much of the gear is re-hashed straight from earlier titles. The devs on this game didnt fail, in order to fail you have to try. This game shows no improvements over past Mx Vs ATV titles. I feel bad for spending money on this title, I feel bad for getting my hopes up. THIS GAME IS PATHETIC, ITS A BAD JOKE. If there is to be any redemption there is so much work to be done, this title should actually release around 2017.Edit since release:Game now runs at 35-60 fps inconistantly, resolution scaling is obviously locked below 1080. There might be new bikes but they are DLC. Some new gear. Devolper asked that I re-review, so here it is. Game is still a hot mess, graphics are re-hashed and look terrible, physics feel unnatural, there is little to no innovation. So there you go &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥on me and call it rain"" and then ask for an award after minimal effort, I stand behind my original review, a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥at 60fps is still a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥"
76561198005182275,Recommended,282050,24263295,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Gage™,"At first coming from reflex, I hated this game with a passion. But after having over 2k hours on reflex over the years, it was time to look for something else. 1st impression, no feel for the bike, couldn't turn, coudln't whip, could barely make any of the jumps. And why is the camera panning sideways in 3rd person? This of all things really screwed me over, this panning of the camera sideways in every turn, made it very easy to run off the track in every turn. I felt limited it what I could do.Quit and played reflex some more, but the hours were wearing me down. Started playing Encore again when I heard KTM's were released as DLC. This time I gave it an honest try with an open mind, not allowing the sea of negativity to influence my opinion before I gave the game an real try. I would play to get to a point where I could get some clean laps in and start pushing, because this is where racing games come alive, when you are on the gas!The biggest difference for me between liking and hating this game, (other than the KTM's), was forgetting about 3rd person and playing in 1st person. After I started getting some basic lines down it really felt like Encore was designed to be played in 1st person, not 3rd. The game just felt so much more fluid in this view, much closer to what I've come to expect from an MX vs ATV game. Looked way better and played better as you feel the bike more as you actually have a feel for the front of the bike. 3rd person by comparison feels very, VERY stiff and static.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is-7gIsE3JYI came to realize that my initial opinion of the game was compounded by friends saying ""don't play this game it sucks."" It was also influenced by the fact that the supercorss was different from Reflex, which is what I was used to. When I first started reflex I hated it, why? because it didn't play like unleashed. And reflex turned out to be one of my most played games of all time. Also bear in mind that reviews from early access are not seperated. It was a totally different game back then, and a lot of gripes have been addressed.The tracks themselves offer a nice variety of content, though I do wish nordic would release the 2016 AMA supercross tracks which are all out there....somewhere. Not as much a fan of some of the outdoor tracks but they do offer a completly different challenge with those flat turns that require a completly different approach to how you attack the track. I do wish SX tracks would get rutted the same amount as outdoors though, Sounds are pretty well done, feels great when you open up the throttle, go though the whoops and rev the bike in the air.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs-B3i9MH4IAt it's core this still is an MX vs ATV game. Lots of huge lines to be found, still feels great when you land the rythms clean and you put down a fast lap - Physics are pretty much on par with what you would expect with an Mx vs ATV game, not ultra realistic but not over the top arcadey. Feels like there is much more traction than reflex and the clutch will actually give you a decent boost. Unlike reflex, you actually have to use the clutch and brakes in encore, as you can very easily blow the turns. I do wish, however, that manual shifting was a little more refined so that there would be a real benifit to manually working your way though the gears instead of staying in 5th and using the clutch. That said automatic transmission works just as well and is what you would expect from an mx vs atv game without manual shifting. In the end I feel both are on par with eachother.Preloading can seem over the top in 3rd person as it seem like the bike gets popped up and launched forward, but I find it much more mellow playing in 1st person. In my videos above, I do preload quite a few jumps but you don't see that huge pop up and forward that you see in 3rd person.At this point, after hating encore for so long, I'm playing it a lot more. (but I still hate it's implemention of 3rd person which I think puts a lot of people off). Its not a perfect game, it still has it quirks and still could benifit from some elbow greese, but what game is perfect?So if you're thinking of trying this game, ignore the sea of negativity. Stop by my page and check out some of my videos and see for yourself how much fun this game can be. See you on the track racers!"

This game's physics feel like they've been dumbed down for children the ages of 3-5.  Any connection to real-world physics is lost here, unfortunately.   This is a problem in previous titles but here it's gone into turbo mode.   I dare say that this game isn't as fun as the original ExciteBike stand-up arcade game.  At least there you had control and things made sense.  Then there's the speed of this game.  It's mind-numbingly slow movements combined with the way the physics make no sense leaves me feeling a bit sick after just a few minutes of playing.The graphics options...there are none.   I mean NONE.  Not even a screen size resolution option.  Not even a Full Screen option.  It starts (and stays) in 'windowed mode' at what looks like 1280x720.  The only way to get Full Screen is to Maximize the game window in the Task Manager.    The quality of the graphics is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age.   It's probably one of the worst looking and worst playing motocross game i've ever played.Worth $24.00?  Absolutely not!  Real wotrh (using other Steam games and prices as a guide) - $4.Unless they're considering a full replacement of everything in this game,  don't buy it.There is one thing positive, though... The power the clutch has at low speeds is just right.  If Reflex had that i'd be happy with that game._________________________________________________________________________________________EDIT- Looking on the website i see a fraudulent claim!http://s29.postimg.org/hdes63d47/Capture.pngThat is definitely NOT true!  Steam should pull this game from its website at least until the time Nordic either remove the lie from their website,  or until they actually comply with the above claim.  This is not acceptable!"

,Recommended,282050,14755255,"Posted: 5 March, 2015",all,CountryMac,"It is in early access, however it is still a strong game with lots of promise. I started the game up and I instantly was taken back to the memories of playing MX Vs. ATV Unleashed on the PC when I was younger. The physics (especially traction) as well as the animations are rough around the edges, however Nordic seems to be eager for some feedback to make this game into something that can relaunch this franchise. I would recommend this game in this state to anyone who appreciates Nordic's effort to resurrect the game, or a die hard member of the community.

Sadly this game gets a massive thumbs down, not so much for the gameplay itself more for the way the new Rainbow studiosNordic games has handled this title as well as their development processes.1.This game came locked originally, allowing us to ride 4 tracks and 2 bikes (not including the 450), was then later hacked by members of the community which unlocked content which in turn forced Rainbow to release a slapdash update to release the content which was already there for us.2.The lack of content being added to this special exclusive PC version (which is now due for console, exclusive eh)TBH its pretty feeble how much is actually being released, 3 Alive nationals and 1 freeride.  (which were the crap tracks) the rate in which things are coming are very slow tbh. WARNING Rainbow announced that PC players would also have to pay for the JS7 Compound, all OEM bikes (except Suzuki) and new gear. When they stated on their official forums months prior to release that ALL alive content including the JS7 tracks would be free.3.They boasted HD Textures and improved graphics, sadly folks this is not the case. There is nothing more than a poor console poor here with some fuzzy filter over the image and what looks like some slight MSAA on some of the tracks.4.The game itself still seems off compared to previous titles, for me personally i've tried my damn near hardest to ride fluid and smooth like other MX games and Reflex but this is still too clunky and very rigid in comparison.Its ok to play for 10 mins here and there but thats about it im afraid. If you are looking at this game as a subsitute for Reflex then tbh i would probably look elsewhere.5. No deformation that you really noticed, especially physically.I could go on and on about this game and its flaws but sadly i think the thing that makes this game bad is probably the way the Developers have gone about their business. Asking fans for feedback on what we'd like to see in a game and for our ideas, to all blatantly be ignored and pushed aside to accomadate for thier own game. Also im not quite sure who they think their demographic are nowadays as they stated our testers think its the best. Perhaps their testers are several limbless farm animalsPOST EARLY ACCESS REVIEWstill buggy even after leaving early access, pathless AI which just ride straight over berms with no anticpation to stop at turns.. still has the flashing horizon bug and the weird texture rendering bug where you can see strange almost holographic artifacts as a top layer to some textures.. i guess their way to optimize stuff is just to compress already buggy textures and models thus making the game look as the 2009/10 prequel Reflex.Ok for short bursts of fun but if you are looking for a 2015 graphically plesent simcade experience then keep looking cus its not here."

I picked up a copy immediately, and one for a friend to boot.  I was incredibly disappointed... in fact, my favorite part of the game so far has been recreating the original sound track to listen while playing.

I have owned every MX VS ATV game since the first release way back on PS2 as a testimate to my loyalty. As a rider myself and a motocross enthusiast I have to say that the physics are terrible. I wasn't expecting a one to one simulator but to me the physics engine needs a major overhaul.  The graphics are aweful and somewhat blurry looking. I do have what few graphics settings there are maxed out. Performance has not really been an issue for me. After the recent performance update I average about 80 FPS. The DLC model can go burn in H***.... $139.68 for all the DLC !!!! REALLY??????? Good God, NO THANKS NORDIC that is absurd. I would not recommend this game to my Worst Enemy. Also a word of advice to Nordic, take a look at Bohemia Interactive's business model and how they communicate with their gaming community. It is probably the best I have ever seen from a game developers stand point. I am still desperately craving the next great MX game. Every year the Motocross community gets larger and larger. Between Freestyle and Racing the Motocross fan base is larger, right now, than it has ever been in the history of the sport. Yes, there is a demand out there for a triple A motocross game.

I have motion blur turned off and the graphics are still VERY BLURRY and the game gives me headaches after a while. Which brings me to my next point, not only are the graphics options lacking in my opinion, there's no in-game graphics option menu at all!!!Even assuming the optimization issues get fixed at some point, the game despite just being released a few months ago feels like a dated 5+ year old console port with mediocre graphics. It doesn't really offer anything new other than rhythm racing.This has been by far the most disappointing game in recent years for me.

Just trust me, the way the game's built it feels so much better that way.Okay now that that's been established... the actual gameplay.The Reflex system IS in this game, but if the last game you played was Reflex, well, it handles a little differently, so be prepared. The rider control influences the bike a lot more in turns, you can easily accidentally 180-360 degree turn your bike if you aren't careful. Other than that, the responsiveness is a lot better and feels a lot more like your rider has weight. It does make the physics system a little wonky if you ignore the rider control though, as the bike feels a lot more like a slippery brick, Rainbow has done a wonderful job of weighting these systems together and the rider and bike feel separate and together at the same time (unlike Reflex where they often felt more separate than anything else).Vehicle customization returns and changing off stock parts does change the performance of the bike/atv, although the fine tuning from Reflex is not there, (I'm very sad about this).The AI still crashes into you, but it won't throw you off your ride. It actually drives like it isn't trying to commit a murder suicide constantly, although the AI doesn't compensate for slipperiness on the ATVs so be prepared to see more than one com flying at you from another track section. Other than that, it's no more easy or difficult, you just won't be forcibly wiped out by the AI every 10 secs if you get stuck in the group.Your Bike is also more sturdy now, or at least it feels more sturdy (I've been told it's slipperry though if you don't pull back on the rider to increase traction), and wiping out isn't quite as easy unless you throw the bike and rider hard in one direction or ram your front wheel into the ground when landing. The actual Reflex (QTE to stay on the bike from Reflex game) is gone making some landings that seem like they should throw you off strange when they would have thrown the QTE to recover in your face before, you now have to recover (or break your riders neck) with your own decisions, the bike will not auto-recover via magical Analog stick flick anymore.And finally we also see the return of the 50cc class. That's random but it's so fun.Overall Score:Pros-- The Reflex system, after a minor adjustment period, feels a lot better- The core gameplay is still there, however it leans heavily on the reflex system rather than steering.- Bike customization affects performance to a degree- Your placement is still determined more by the lines you picked and your ability to control the bike than your ability to out run the AI with blind speed. In fact, blind speed will  lose the race a lot of the time, even on rookie.- There are 34 tracks. 17 Supercross, 12 National, and 5 Rhythm- You can wear a chicken mask as a helmetCons- The Gameplay is a bit more nuanced and weighted towards the rider than before. As such it feels very clunky if you ignore the rider controls.- Bike can feel slippery and underperforming to new players. This is fixed with parts which are unlocked during play easily.- Fine tuning is goneOverall 7.5/10 It's good."

It's almost the same as MX vs ATV Alive but the physics are worse. A lot of the gear and music in the game is exactly the same as Alive, the graphics look just like Alive, but the bikes handle terribly. when you first start the game it takes a very long time to unlock upgrades, tires, gear etc. the bikes slide out very easily until you unlock tires that hook up better. In the air the bikes handle like tanks, it's very difficult to move the bikes in the air. The physics are what make this game so bad, the bikes dont carry hardly any forward momentum when you hit jumps, they get a lot of air and then it's like somebody turned the gravity on and they fall almost straight down. Using the clutch is a must is corners and if tap the clutch repeatedly you go faster in the straits for some reason. Also, if you put your settings on manual transmission, you can keep you're bike in 5th gear all the way around the track and clutch boost like no other, it's incredibly unrealistic. As much as I dislike this game, I did enjoy racing pit bikes! The pit bikes are the only reason I even own the game on PC, they're very agressive, and they somehow clear all the jumps that you can clear on a 250. So if you're looking for a game that you'll play for a long time and captures that real racing feeling, this game isn't the one, but if you're looking for something that might be fun for a week, it might suit you.**Update Oct 30, 2015**Game is a little bit better. More features and tweaks have been added to the game that've made it a little more playable. Still not that great of a game, but it does look like they're starting to put more effort into it. It needs to be optimized though, I can play GTA V on max settings, but this game doesn't even have as good of graphics and even with the textures turned down and what not, it still plays like it's in slow motion. There currently aren't any brand name bikes to choose from, and none of the bikes in the game actually resemble any brand name bikes, but my face did light up when I saw that they added a graphics kit to the game that I actually have on my bike IRL. I still don't really like this game but maybe you will."

But this time around the Reflex physics seem even worse, playing on my XBOX 360 Controller; the bike is never stable on woops or whenever you need to lean, and also it never seems to return to the upright position 100%, i tested this across 2 different controllers to rule out that as an issue.- Rythym Racing: Awesome concept, would have been the best aspect of the game for me except this stupid reflex engine ruins any sort of fast rythym you can get going.- Another Physics Issue: I kept this one seperate because it is another pain in the♥♥♥♥♥enitrely. When you clutch dump at the start of a down ramp on a jump you get this sudden, VERY UNREALISTIC burst of acceleration, same as when you holeshot off the line; which seems like you get a good start but then your speed is quickly wiped off.

Still cannot say I would suggest buying this, there were marginal framerate improvements, however, with a GTX 780 a significant portion of the game is still un playable, and the frame rates in the remaining bit are not what I would call enjoyable or acceptable, being that on an indoor supercross track I was lucky to hit 50, and probably averaged around 30 or 40, that is on an indoor track with minimal impact on your system.  Everything except the indoor supercross does not appear to be playable at the moment, at around a 23fps average for what I would say is still a high end video card, running on high with not anti aliasing at 1080p, which should definitely not be any issue for this system, as it maxes pretty much every other game I've found at 1080p just fine.TL;DR: Marginal frame rate improvements with latest update, very significant portion of the game is still not playable, and the portion that can be considered playable is not enjoyable.  Would not suggest buying the game.Keeping this note here: there is $116.99 worth of DLC, for a game that costs $29.99.  Let that sink in."

I'm still learning the tracks and what the bike can do but it feels at least as good as reflex to me.  I only have two real complaints, I can't find anywhere to turn rumble off on the controller or a way to turn in game chat off.  The in game chat I can ignore, but with a wireless controller having rumble on kills batteries too quickly.  It is different than reflex, being able to go fast on reflex doesn't automatically transfer to going fast on this one - which is a good thing.  Once you get used to the way the controls work the new tracks are a blast!Update:  80+ hours on this one now, and I'm liking it more the more I play.  Learning how the controls work and getting faster takes time...just like reflex did.  Most of the really fast guys have 200+ hours and I anticipate it taking me that long or longer to get really good.  Doing the career with laps set to 10 seems to help in getting to the point where the controls are instinctual, learning the tracks/finding fast lines etc."

If you were more like me and only ever played the free-ride from the other games (30+ hours of it on reflex on steam and 50+ hours on disc version of reflex) then you might want to pick up Reflex, as I had much more fun with it. The only redeeming quality of the game for me was the different bikes (didn't touch the ATV's). There is actually a variety of sizes of MX bikes that change how you play the game."

,Not Recommended,282050,21511266,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,NodnarbReklaw,"Looks like after the recent update this game seems to be much better with my computer, usually getting a constant 60fps in SX and 30-45 in MX. I really do thank Rainbow for finally fixing the performane issues, so now I shall write a fair review in return. I'm gonna try and keep it short as possible, but looks like there's lots of things to cover here. I'm not trying to bash on Rainbow or Nordic in any way, just reviewing the game in my honest and opinion.First off, the game itself is kinda fun, but doesn't really live up to what i was expecting. I was honestly hoping for a reflex2.0, but it turned out as a washed out Alive2.0.To start here, the physics are honestly what i think are weighing down the rest of the game so much. I would have been fine if the same physics for reflex were used for supercross encore, because it really is the better of the motocross games out there. The new physics engine isn't terrible, but it feels like there was a step backwards from the right direction. The turning is like skating on brown ice simulator amped up a notch, and the whips are more like slightly maneuvering the bike sideways rather than flipping it which ever way you want like a sick pancake. scrubbing is alright but sometimes you'll end up turning sideways and transition into a super lame whip then proceed to land sideways because bringing back a whip is actually hard to do for some reason.Braking seems to be a problem too. i had a few times when i hit the brakes and spun into a 720 noscope as if i were playing mw2 quickscope battles on rust. i know i had the oversized brakes updgrade on but jeez dude i dont think they have that kind of power.Again, unlike reflex this game has your rider as a living tank that holds on to the bike with an absolute death grip and will only wreck if you are completely flatlining or upside down when landing a jump. Same with getting smacked into by other riders, instead of both wrecking, it just goes into bumper cars mode. and for the most part the AI is still dumb as it has been for generations now. most the time you can win a race going half speed as long as the opponents keep crashing into one another.This game also really abuses the use of the clutch and seatbouncing, it's over powered what you can do if you just pop the clutch(which would stall the bike) and then seatbounce off a triple, you'll end up quading into the next section from the super mega ultrasanic speed boost. also it'd be real sweet if there was a manual gear shifting option, because no full sized racing dirtbike i've ever seen is automatic.AND WHERE DID THE TRACK DEFORMATION GO?that was one of  the coolest features for reflex, because you could carve out your out deep ruts and really rail it around berms with em, but in sx encore it seems like you cant even put an indention into the ground, sadly. Also... the rider reflex thing that you can use to save yourself from a crash is absent from this game, it's just an automatic animation. why would you do that?so yeah it's apparent now that i really liked reflex, and lots of other mx vs atv fans can agree it's the best one out there.Now that the biggest problem  is out of the way, i can get onto the little details and stuff i noticed were missing.Ok, so the career mode isnt really much of a career, it's just racing after racing and getting some cool rewards, which is how it's been in pretty much all of the previous mx vs atv games. I'd like to see a career mode done differently, with sponsorships and all that fun stuff. You know another thing that's just completely missing from the supercross experience? where's all the qualifying, heats, semis, and lcq races? the race just starts off in the main event, which is really anticlimatic for me. Where's the 20 man gate drop too? i've been waiting around for that for years. This isnt much of a big deal, but it'd really add to the authenticity that makes this game ""supercross"".Sountrack is good for the most part with some cool fitting music, but there were some songs i felt kinda killed the mood for me. BUT i did hear some of the old reflex songs and i was really excited to hear those again because they are amazing.The customization is still nice with the variety of cool gears there are, but there's always gotta be more. Would be nice if there were even more added for free, or really really.... really cheapMost of the tracks out there are actually great and feel like a SX track. so that's one good thing going for the game if i may say. The addition of the MX tracks from alive is definitely great, and im sure glad it happened, so why not also add tracks from other games too? reflex, untamed, and unleashed all had some good stuff and i'd like to see em again. why not throw in some of the older gears too?also please dont make expensive dlc.  like seriosuly nobody likes that. if a company were to sell me dlc, it better be worth every pennyso im finally gonna wrap up this super long review. i didnt spend too much time organizing but i think i got my point across.best wishes to rainbow and nordic because i want to believe they can bring the series back to life. thanks to the developers again, but come on man you can surely do better, YOU JUST GOTTA BELIEVE!TLDR: game is fun, but it aint no reflex. i wanna recommend this game but i just cant do it.""it's ok""6/10"

So far, the PC port runs smooth.- Between Reflex, Alive, and this, the latter handles the best, but that isn't really saying much.- The tracks are pretty good, despite most of them being built for the 450s mostly.- Real-life tracks are good, despite some design flaws, mainly in the whoop sections.Cons:- Randomly throws you in directions, only worsened by the frequent recovery animations that are guaranteed to throw you over a corner. This also makes the helmet camera useless, as you practically have no control.- Recycled tracks from Alive, which most of them are bland and boring (Should have used Reflex tracks, too, as they are some of the best Nationals tracks in the series).- As a veteren of the series, it's way too easy. All-time difficulty is still a joke.- Same music from the past games, which is good, especially with Strung Out on the setlist, but still gets boring after a while.- The damn haybales are solid. They aren't in real life, they squish like bugs.Overall, it's still fun to play. The mechanical issues can be resolved through playtime, since you get used to it and can predict what will happen, especially with a long history of the series.6/10, should release a custom track designer, they'd make so much more money and would bring this up to an 8/10, at least."

The game does seem to be running better now. The SX still drops occasionally, but it is nowhere near as bad as before and not too noticeable.I played one National event, and,  while not as smooth as I'd like, it is now playable and if you can deal with a few drops here and there, not bad. But also, having played the game more now, I do have a few complaints. Let's be honest, the DLC is a money grab here. Sell me the whole game up front. I get adding on new tracks as time goes by, but these were tracks released  on the original XBOX 360 and PS3 games, not brand spanking new. And having to pay for a bike that the competitor offers as standard is getting a little old. However, it is still a fun game. I bring up these issues in hopes that one day the developer will listen and I won't have to keep playing the lottery hoping I can win in order to fund the motocross game I'd like...you know, the tracks from the Lucas Oil Nationals and better physics. I mean, come on, I haven't played Budds Creek since Jeremy McGrath Supercross on the N64. GIVE THE PLAYERS WHAT THEY WANT, but I digress.If you like motocross/supercross, you'll like this game....hopefully they'll come out with a great sequel.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have to say I regret purchashing this game a little. I read the other reviews and said, ""Maybe they're crazy and it runs just fine."" And then I bought it and said ""Nope, I am crazy for thinking it will be different."" I have an NVIDIA GTX 960 with the game installed on a SSD and the frame rate drops are so horrible on the Nationals tracks that I can't stand to play it. The drops aren't too bad on Supercross style tracks, but it is annoying. Having said that, maybe if I upgrade my old AMD A6 processor and added more RAM, it might run better as I've noticed memory and CPU to be very,very high while running this game. Also, dropping some of the settings seems to have improved it a bit. Other newer games run just fine, so maybe this one is just not optimized for PC.I will say that the handling does seem to be improved from the XBOX 360 version. My rider no longer does 360s on the ground a lot and doesn't seem to cross jump like a goon all the time. Is it the same as MX Simulator? No. But honestly, I haven't fallen over in real life as much as my MX Sim guy, so take it as you will.  Is it the same as MXGP? Not really. The turning still doesn't feel as nice. But, you can throw way better whips....in that you can actually control a whip. If you all ready own it on 360 or PS3, it's probably a waste of your time, but I am lazy and don't feel like walking to the other side of the house to turn on my 360, so I have it on here. It's just the same game though, there's not really anything new for you.If you like motocross, well supercross, then it's a decent game, assuming you have an extremely powerful machine, maybe. I don't know, that frame rate thing could be present on all of them. Or I guess you could just wait for the May release of the Xbox One version and stream it to your PC. But I cannot honestly recommend it until it can be played without frame drops on a modest PC instead of a ""Dude, I future-proofed the crap of my system"" PC. I'll update this review if anything changes."

However, do keep in mind that this took a good while, and at first my 30 dollars went down the drain. Now, i'd say 20 is a fair price for the game, given that it now has slightly better graphical options though very limited. However, if you can manage to catch this game and the dlc's on sale (50% or so) it's worth picking up and giving a shot. Physics are better although still considered childs play. Framerate has improved and 1440p is a welcome change (may not work for all, I have amd virtual supersampling).

Just like Reflex, you need to use both sticks to control your rider to completetion and I personally don't like it that much. It seems this game is more mechanics heavy over being just fun. It's much harder to fall off your vehicle though and it just feels so unrealistic as much as other parts of this game feel realistic. The AI isn't too smart and just lands everywhere, even ontop of you (you still don't bail). The game has no graphics options and even on an impressive PC it lags at some points. Speaking of graphics, they look great, but at this point the textures don't really ""pop"", but fade in the closer you get. I'm sad there isn't any outside tracks, and some tracks seem somewhat similar. A decent amount is there, but I really would like outside tracks. Customization is pretty good and vehicles have their own performance stats.

Basically, it feels like mx vs atv supercross on the 360/ps3, except they cleaned up the handling a bit (feels like I have some traction now) and threw in the motocross tracks from alive.  I love reflex, but the 90mph tracks and doing a forward or back flip off of a tuff block at 10-20mph really got old.  This game has some quirks for sure, but I'm enjoying it.  For example, as with the console version, there are rare phantom inputs that will steer me off course, or throw my rider way forward off a jump.  Also, I can really feel the loss of forward speed (like crazy wind resistance) in the air.  On the other hand, though, I like the tighter tracks (especially the outdoor tracks from alive), the fact that I actually need the brakes, and the handling in the turns.  The clutch is crazy op as others say, but I like that I can goof a turn and make up for it with that.As for the graphics, maybe some people are reviewing the game without launching the graphics settings program first (a seperate thing for some reason, just like reflex)?  I played at 4k and other than the inconsistent framerate and some lod popping, it looked just as good as reflex to me (even better in some places where texture resolution is higher and meshes have more detail).  I think rainbow/nordic REALLY need to force the settings program to launch before the first play, because the default settings look terrible, and leave a bad first impression.As a fan of the series since the first motocross madness, I would have preferred that rainbow just tighten up the tracks and ease up on the crash-if-someone-nudges-me physics in reflex to make a follow-up game (instead of completely changing the engine for alive/supercross), but I'm definitely not in agreement with the chorus of bad reviews this game is getting.

There, I said it.There are two major things about this game that annoy me.The first is obvious; the framerate issues. From the poor console port of Reflex from 7 years ago, until now, these games have had poor framerate issues (and graphical issues on Reflex for some cards including mine). Whenever you're by yourself on a supercross track, the framerate is almost always above 60fps on newer hardware. Anywhere else (nationals, free ride, rhythm racing), it drops considerably. The developers have said that this is due to the trees, and the lag everywhere else is due to the dirt physics and terrain deformation. I kinda halfway believe that this is the case, but whatever.The second is the clutch kick. It is WAY too strong. Yes, it gets you out of terrible situations whenever you don't hit a rhythm perfectly, but in no way should it be that strong, especially on hard packed dirt. Once they tone that down a bit, I'd say this game is pretty spot on with its physics.Also, the track scaling is pretty big compared to real life like it has been for previous games (except Alive, which was rebranded to this. The smaller tracks in Alive had perfect scaling IMO), but I remember seeing an interview where a developer explained that this is because they want the game to have the pick-up-and-play aspect and that the game isn't too hard. Eh, I can live with that.If the problems can be fixed in a timely manner, this game gets a solid 8.5/10 from me. If not, it's staying at a 6/10. I can still recommend this game based on its potential and current playability."

I initially thought they need more time to release it in a playable version.Soooooo what do you get when you buy the game now(8th of March 2015)?It in fact is a version of the game that is ported from console using the same ""program"" that was used for Reflex. You have to start a exernal program to change the settings, if you can call it that. the only thing you can do in the graphics menu is change the resolution and toggle fullscreen, Thats it.Ok could still be not that bad considering that Reflex was playable on PC after Nordic did the last patch.WRONG! I really hate hating the game for this since it is still early-access but they really had enough time.WHAT IS/COULD BE RIGHT WITH THIS GAME:- It didn't stutter/lag, at least not in the breaks between game-crashes (i7 4790k, HD7970)- It felt kinda like the console versionWHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME:-There is no career mode-The bikes have different stats than in the console version-You can only play the first 4 tracks because you have to play career to unlock more-The graphics are WORSE than the console version-I don't really know anything else because it crashed 2 times within 30min(don't ask me why Steam thinks I only played it 5min idk) and I really don't want to play it again before the next patchDo I like this game?MAYBE.

If something doesn't feel right you can give feedback and most likely the forum of ill repute will agree with you.  I love love love love loved the last MX / ATV -- complete with the crazy trucks and tracks throught he mud and woods and craziness.  I'm not all that much for the inside tracks.  I can move the rider as I need to, the sluggishness mentioned below is because they weren't using the other stick (which controls the pitch of the rider) so you can lean into corners, lean forward in to corners, lean backward in to corners (why?! - cause you can) and it's very responsive.  Something else you'll note (and I loved this about the last game too) is the tracks you make are not just graphic decals.  They're actual impressions in the surface of the track, you can (and will) get bumped by them, get unintended air, and be thrown off by them or even led on rails through them if you hit them right.  I think this is genious and should be a part of any racing game - car or otherwise that has anything remotely to do with DiRT.It's a solid $25 -- I want to see less supercross, more outdoors cross... forget what the menu said... and here I end with dumb."

Totally unrealistic!3.TUFF BLOCKS OBJECT COLLISION - Modify this code, When you hit a TUFF BLOCK the rider just stops, like he has hit an invisible wall and he just stays straight, no angular collision movement and totally unrealistic consequences to running into this object, Reflex was way more believable!4.CONTROLLER SETTINGS, FORCE FEEDBACK IS NOT AN OPTION - Fix it, give us the option to turn off game pad force feedback.5.PHYSICS - THE WHIP - This is the biggest gripe I have about the game, put the REFLEX whip back into this game and you will have a major hit on your hands!

I would not recommend this game to anyone with any PC build below high end ($1000+) I have a $900 PC, 0.9 hours was about all i could take of this to be honest. So should you decide to buy this game, just know this:- Keyboard and mouse controls are impossible, you WILL need a controller.- OK Graphics and effects, they try to hide a lot of the texture and effect flaws with motion blur.- Crappy animations.- VERY bad optimization.- Chase camera is very weird at times.- A few noticeable bugs here and there.- Most graphics are locked so good luck with that.- Physics are buggy.- Scale on most objects are off, or so it seems to me.Overall, this is a step back from Reflex; and yes, before you go and comment that, ""Its only early access!!""

This game is part of a long series by THQ that I have followed and played religiously since childhood. As an amatuer motocross racer, I have always been drawn toward games like this. I have roughly 10,000 hours in the series and will say this; I LOVE THIS GAME, but the community on PC is almost non-existant. I have this game for PC, XBOXONE, and PS4. The mechanics are worse on XBOX, but it is almost impossible to find anyone to race with on PC. This game is best played on PS4.PS4 - 9/10XBONE - 8/10PC - 6/10I hate to not have the best recommendation for this game on Steam, but it is honest."

I remember watching a video of a dev talking about how they were using the reflex engine, yet here we are with an alive clone that plays like a crap mx game you'd download for free on your iphone.I really want this game to go somewhere and not waste my 20 bucks, so I'll list things I find to be poorly done.-So far I've played 3 races, after that I can't play more than 2-3 laps without the game shutting off. no crash message, nothing. Just ♥♥♥♥♥ off and goes to desktop.-The AI is inconsistant as hell, theres times I'll easily put 5-10 seconds on the AI, then they randomly come out of nowhere and pass me, when I didn't make a mistake.-The controls are sluggish feeling, it feels like something out of a game I played long ago, Big motha truckers. I don't want to feel like I'm driving a semi when I'm playing an MX game.-When you jump, it feels like you slow down and just fall out of the air, that isn't how it works, and isn't how it should look/feel.-Preloading feels more like a forward boost, using it in the woops section effectively turns you into a superhero. If you fix the problem stated previously of slowing down and falling out of the air, you wouldn't need the forward boost to make the jumps in a preload, just the upward boost.-The wheelies make me sad. If you don't know what I mean, go into the game and try a wheelie.-The WAIT. I was really expecting something good with how much the game was hyped up for a while, especially now that it's been delayed so much. If you want people to remain interested, you have to keep them up to date, at least a little information every few weeks would be cool. You can't expect people to be happy when you make them wait this long, and give them next to no information so there is no feedback from the fans until you are just about ready to launch the game."

It could use more but it's definately playable now.ORIGINAL REVIEW:MX vs. ATV is back. The question is, is it good?The answer is, kind of.MvA Supercross Encore (long enough title?) Is an updated version of 2014's Mva Supercross originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3. The game features updated visuals, rider gear, bikes, Nationals tracks from MvA Alive, and a new event called Rhythm Racing. The game also retains the tracks from the 2014 Supercross release. The handling of the bikes was very clearly overhauled since the release of the early access version, and you can actually whip bikes around quite a bit now. Leaning into turns was drastically changed, you're able to slide around a lot more than you could before. The tracks look nice and are fun to play. Now, why is this game 'kind of' good?The optimization is downright horrible. Really. On a GTX 680 and a Core i7, you'd think I could run this game no problem, that is NOT the case. Most tracks run at around 40-50 FPS, often dropping into the low 20s. I just can't get my head around why the optimization is so bad. Reflex had very good optimization and ran like a dream. This game, is sluggish at best, unfortunately. It really is a shame, as the new physics are actually pretty fun to play with.Honestly, with the optimization how bad it is right now, I simply cannot reccomend this game. Yes, the tracks are fun and flow well. Yes, the new features are really nice. But the optimization is really dragging it down and I hope it gets improved within reasonable time."

Granted you don't use the clutch to shift but I think you can if you wanna be that realistic.A few issues: The physics are wonky at times, the known ""whip glitch"" that as far as I know Rainbow is working on fixing (at least it seems that way from the bug report thread) and scrubs are really hard (but maybe I just suck). Also the first person camera is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's more realistic than Reflex but sometimes you can see through your arms. Although maybe it's just the FOV/resolution I play at.Coming from an actual rider I would give this game a 7/10.
