Too bad I don't play mobile games and if you don't... pass on this one as well. The gesture system is a tedious bore with a mouse and I don't really see it being that much better on a touchscreen.If it had more traditional gameplay interface it would be much improved as a pc game experience.

Sound design, Music, Monsters, Characters, Battle System... just WOW!The 'weird' kind of look to the enemies really make the game unique!!!The only thing i'm going to ""complain"", is that I am a grindy type of person, and I love to level up, a lot.It's not a bad thing that the game doesn't have grinding! It's just a thing i really like in rpgs.Anyway, this game gets a 912837918237 out of 10 from me.On a last note, just so you know, I threw my money at the screen the second I saw the game."

The combat system can be somewhat addictive and challenging when you try to perform some of the harder and stronger attacks. There are 3 difficulty settings, the higher levels adding more clicks or swipes to each attack. And of course there are weapons and skills upgrades. It has great bosses, awesome music, nice story with interesting humor and of course a very interesting turn based combat system that is challenging, satisfying and entertaining."

I mean, Fearless Fantasy.It's a neat little Indie RPG game with some hilarious and over-the-top dialogue, phenomenal soundtrack and great voice acting.The game has no free roam option or anything like that, you go from mission to mission, level up and buy new stuff.. The usual. The combat style is really similar ""as you can imagine"" to Final Fantasy games, turn based combat.But the combat itself is something pretty different and unusual for these kinds of RPG games, Have you ever heard of or played ""Osu!"" because that's how the combat plays out. You pick what you wanna do when it's your turn and then you move your cursor around according to your attacks like you were playing Osu!.As mentioned before, the voice acting, overall writing for the dialogue and soundtrack are all freaking amazing.In addition i'd like to say that the character designs for especially the enemies are absolutely gorgeous, well maybe not gorgeous but unique and likeable.. I'll still go with gorgeous, gorgeous in their hideous and ugly way. I also love how the camera works during battles, it's very cinematic and makes everything look so darn epic.There's not much actual story being shown discarding the cutscenes that look like some childs' doodles on Paint.But i do love how the characters have their little discussions with each other after a battle, teaching us more about the lore and the story and doing some character development which is always a plus in a RPG game.I have to admit though, the game felt bit too difficult at the beginning.. Or maybe it's just that the game is so fast paced i just didn't have time to really practise anything.The game also looks like a Mobile port but i'm pretty sure Fearless Fantasy actually never was a Mobile Game to begin with. So that's cool.Overall it's a pretty solid game with very few issues and a cheap price tag.Buy it if you enjoy playing either Final Fantasy or Osu!.. Or both!"

Using your finger to literally trace the directions exactly as they are as opposed to using your mouse to guess and estimate with your entire hand can have a great change in you performing ok and performing amazing.With that out of the way, the story is both humorous and entertaining and certainly not completely implaussible as far as actual rpg storylines go. I really wish they had added a sort of training mode where you could practice some of the sequences as some of them do appear quite quickly in veteran and give you only a short window of time for inputs. I think potential alternate input methods such as keyboard inputs could be a potential option or setting that could be alternated to.Overall though for the price I think I got my good share of fun and entertainment and would certainly be interested and look forward to more releases like this one."

The music is catchy, the characters are interesting- I could even go so far as to say lovable, I found the humor light-hearted and enjoyable, and the upgrade system is simple and liberating, The animations are kickass.Each level is a gauntlet of battles. Every time you select a command or trying to defend, these arrows show up and you have to run your pointer through then to succeed. I found this more interactive and there was a better feel to attacks. it was also challenging than it looks and sounds. When I missed my chance to get it perfectly, I found myself waggling my mouse about.The monsters are also the weirdest thing I ever waggled my mouse at.Even though the cutscenes need a bit of polishing, that is only a small flaw in this gem of a game.9.75/10 would waggle my mouse again"

It's a turn-based RPG, but you have to use timing and mouse movements to get the most out of your attacks (which reminds me a bit of the Penny Arcade games). Your skill/armor upgrades are somewhat basic.  There's no exploration, you just follow a path set for you. I actually think it would be more fun with a touch screen than a mouse."

,Recommended,282100,14473750,"Posted: 14 February, 2015",all,Imban,"When I first saw this, my reaction to the artstyle was basically ""What the hell is this nonsense?"" Having played it, the answer is that it's amazing nonsense in the best traditions of oldschool JRPGs, and full of hand-drawn cutscenes and fairly charming amateur voice acting for when you're not in combat.Beyond the artstyle, Fearless Fantasy is more or less a standard JRPG with some clearly mobile-influenced elements, like the interface and being divided into short, selectable levels with three difficulty modes each. Despite its fairly short length (only about 3 hours for me, including 2 replays of every level except for the last two), it manages to fully develop all of its mechanics, the well-tuned battle system making it so every action and decision really counts by the end of the game.The only real issue I have with Fearless Fantasy is that the gestures required for the attacks feel like they were designed for a touch interface, but the game hasn't been released on mobile or any platform that typically has a touchscreen yet. However, their website indicates they intend to release a mobile port sometime this year. As a result, while this game comes with my recommendation, I would suggest waiting for the mobile port if you have a smartphone with a decently large screen or a tablet.(Of course, having beaten the game, I don't plan on playing another version of it. As a result, I won't be updating this if the mobile version doesn't come out or is terrible or something.)"

Now, almost two years later, after the developers have overhauled the game and updated it drastically while still keeping the core mechanics intact, it still captivates me, perhaps even more so now.I don't want to spoil the story, but the art design, character design, voice acting and game mechanics are all very well done for such a lesser known title. Whether you play this on a touch screen laptop, or with a mouse, you're likely to never get tired of the combat (which is primarily what the game is based around) as it's something that is easy to learn, but difficult to master.If you enjoy RPG's, unique art styles, fun combat mechanics, great voice acting, humorously cliched (but not in a bad way) character design, than you NEED TO GET THIS GAME.

Crisp, HD visuals that give even pricey graphics cards a run for their money. It's got charm in it's art style, also. It battles out like any lat Final Fantasy game, but in order to deliver your attacks, you have to 'swipe' the screen with your cursor. Yeah, that seems fun for a bit, until you find yourself grinding and having to put up with onset carpel tunnel syndrome as a result of some of those swipes. But again, I digress.

Also these videos are not really in full motion :P but rather hand drawn comic scenes in black outlines and yellow backgroundwas fun playing it, altough it almost felt long to get just one level done, maybe some would not consider that ""worth the time"", also if you regard that the ""gestures"" done by mouse movement just don't get the efficiency through the way they could when playing it on a mobile device or having a touch screen on your laptop/PCI'd still recommend this game, even though I don't feel like doing most levels on veteran mode because it would just take too much effort for not feeling that ""rewarding""enhancing the agility stat results in your moves being executed faster, which can help it.. but of course make it harder too - some moves are done rather slowly in comparison to others howeverstory mode ends without even having most of the abilities maxed out, at least for playing easy/normal that is - so the ""replayabilty"" might suffer from this control issue, although it's quite merciful after all, you can miss an arrow or two and stilll get an epic result if the end of the move was executed well enough, also you can see a bar on top showing you how far away you are from that or if the attack/defense will fail or not"
