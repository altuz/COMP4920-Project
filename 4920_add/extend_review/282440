Rarely will you find a good server to play on as most are comprised solely of hardened veterans who will effortlessly pick you off from afar with a brief *pew* of their rail gun. Which will happen A LOT. This in turn leads to frustration, ultimately spoiling your experience.I'm not saying the game itself is bad, Indeed it's unrivalled in some respects. The fluidity and seemlessness of the movement in Quake is definitely satisfying and you can see why it's earnt it's reputation.However sadly this alone isn't enough to make this game worth a (relatively) hefty price tag of £6.99.tl;dr, Nah, leave it. If you want a piece of Quake history, buy any of the earlier games and you'll get a much more satisfying experience with more ""bang"" for your buck."

,Recommended,282440,29575657,Posted: 29 January,all,Liam,"I have played Quake Live since 2010, back when it was a free plug-in for major browsers. I have also played Quake III Arena for longer, casually.Of course, nothing will beat the original Quake III Arena (Q3A) game, but this is a direct replacement for me. Instead of running a game from 1999 and using hacky methods to get it up to modern standards (native 16:9/16:10 resolution, HUD, etc), I just play this from now on. It includes many community fixes and has been supported for many years (and still is?) so that it looks the best it can be on modern systems. Plenty of bug fixes, too. The games onlyrealdifference is the addition of a new weapon: the Heavy Machine Gun. It does not replace anything that I know of, but should be known.It still has that ""boot up and frag 'em"" mindset in that if you have a few minutes to kill, you can just get straight into a match with no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but is also flexible in the way that you can spend hours on it playing FFA, Clan Arena, Duel, CTF, FreezeTag and more! My personal favourite is Clan Arena :-) (There's a massive map pool, too!)HOWEVER... This game can be plagued with ♥♥♥♥ing veterans. Some people on this have played since the dawn of Quake. They know all of the tricks in the book. Strafe jumping, rocket jumping, all that tomfoolery... So my recommendation to new players is: just stick to Free For All and Capture the Flag until you git gud. Clan Arena and Duels are the most likely to be riddled with these aforementioned skilled veterans. Best to stray away from that frustration. You will only end up abandoning the game like some of my friends have.It used to be completely free with no subscriptions and extra stuff. It simply ran off advertisements. Apparently this was not enough for id software and decided to chuck in subscriptions. Then it was migrated to Steam as NPAPI plugins were no longer being supported on major browsers. Then you had to pay for the whole thing to phase out subscriptions and gain a more sure way of profit. No biggy, you essentially get the most definitive shooter of all time for £6.99. Bargain!The players themselves are usually quite friendly, certainly not as bad as what can be found on CS:GO or any other modern shooter. Players from all over the world play it and you meet some of the best people.MODS MODS MODS... The closest thing you will get to mods are custom maps and some server side scripts. Type certain things into text chat and a sound plays. Class. You can get stuff from the Steam Workshop too, but nothing amazing. Maybe some ""HD"" models, and new extra player models which you cannot use in an online game, so pretty useless otherwise.If you plan to buy this game, and you are new, I would recommend heading straight into the training arena bit (subject to change, name has changed throughout the years) and get yourself acquainted with the basics. Watch some videos on it. Give yourself the best headstart before you dive in head first. Also, bear in mind it is STILL based off the graphics from Q3A, which was released in 1999. The graphics were ahead of its time in those days and most people only play it now for the gameplay.All in all, it does not stand up to its original counterpart for obvious reasons, but it gets a solid 9/10. Sticks true to its roots, plays well on modern machines, pleases eSports fans, fun with friends, and includes original game modes. If you are a seasoned Q3A player, you might find some things that annoy you but all in all it is the same old same old, and if you are new to the series or have not played Q3A, you will find the experience difficult to start, but is still fun in its own right!EDIT: I should also mention the ""liveliness"" of the game. Is it popular? No. Will you find the same player(s) in a server in the same week? Probably. It should be mentioned that whatever game mode you want to play, there will be a server or two that have enough players in. Do not let this hinder your initial thoughts though (however positive or negative) because there isALWAYSa bunch of servers to play on that have a good amount of players on. Tip: When on the server browser, filter out the empty and full servers and you will pretty much always find a decent server to go into every time you log in!Frag 'em all!"

I spent a lot of time mapping for Q2 (CTF) and was part of the Quake community for many years.  This game brings it all back.  Back in the mid to late 90's QuakeWorld became (one of) the first online multiplayer games FPS games.  The games were insanely fast and intense.  After spending many years playing Quake, it became a treasured memory, until I discovered Quake Live.....After buying this I fired it up and found some matches online.  Just because I played a lot of Quake in the past doesn't mean I'm great - I am a 'geezer' after all.  After getting completely owned in a few matches I decided to start my own match with bots.   After a few matches I realized that the free-for-all Quake game is still one of the most intense FPS multiplayer games ever.  The only downtime you get is when you die - as soon as you spawn it is non-stop action until you die again.Bots have been a party of Quake for many years.  When Quake III Arena launched over 16 years ago, id was smart and made this part of the core game.  The ""single player"" portion of Q3A was really multiplayer against bots.  Quake Live is the same thing, though the bots have improved.From what I've seen the bots in Quake Live can be very challenging (if you set their level correctly).  If you have never played Quake before you can easily start a match with low level bots and learn the ropes.  As you progress you can easily ramp up their level to match yours.   They may not be a match for the Quake masters, but they I can see how they will provide hours and hours of entertainment.  FYI - this is the best way to learn the maps!I would recommend this game to any fan of classic multiplayer/FPS games, but also to those who never experienced the thrill of the game that started it all."

,Recommended,282440,31592918,Posted: 6 May,all,Piggy Bank Robber,"I got into this game after watching Rocket Jump Ninja's mouse reviews and how he primarily uses this game to determine how good a mouse is. According to him, Quake is more intensive on mice than most other games. And he is correct, my G403 takes a beating.It takes a beating because this remains one of the fastest shooter games around. It's so fast that in the beginning I kept getting killed and told to neck myself every time I did something wrong or something that another player didn't agree with. The majority of people who still play this game are the seasoned veterans who have played since the beginning. New players are an endangered species in this game because of its age. I played the original Quake 3 seventeen years ago but I never went online because I had no internet at the time. So I knew how to play the game, I knew how to use the weapons, and RJN's highly informative videos on Quake tactics helped me a lot, and I still listen to his advice even though by now I've become used to the impossibly fast-paced nature of the game. I still suck, I'm still nowhere near as good as the veterans, I still have a horrible KD ratio, but it's still very fun because the feel of the game is like no other. I encourage you to reserve your judgment until after you've actually played a few rounds. Clan Arena is my favourite because of the crazy rocket jumping you can do. No, I'm still not good at that either, but I'm learning.This game actually improved my skills in other FPS games, mainly my reaction time and predicting where enemies will be. Playing this game I wondered how I was able to even win matches in the past with what I now consider was horrible reaction time. I've become as sharp as a knife, at least in comparison to what I was before. No, I'm not the best and I don't ever claim to be, nor want to be, just decent. And I'm working on that and having a lot of fun on the way.So for those of you who have been on the fence for a long time, I say go for it, but make sure you have a good FPS-oriented mouse or it will handicap you. This game is the reason why I bought my G403. Bind all your weapons to keys near your movement keys, because you can't win by scrolling the mouse wheel. You will also be yelled at and told to neck yourself because you suck. That's why I still have voice disabled in this game, because some of those hardcore veterans are really the cesspool of humanity or worse. Don't sink to their level, they can go jump in a lake, because is only game, why u heff 2 b med? If you think you're very good at Overwatch or CSGO or whatever fast-paced shooter you play most, play this game and realize how much you still have to learn about shooters. And happy rocket jumping!"

Near IMPOSSIBLE to get into any games, and if you're new, the players there will automatically hate you. You can be the nicest person ever, they will despise everything about you. As for impossible to find a game, I'm referring to Auto-Spec. Odds are, if you join a server, the teams are even. Problem is, if you join the round, the teams become uneven. When the teams are uneven, even if it's ike 11 to 10, typically the person who most recently joined is getting kicked out of the game and into spectator mode. Because of this, most of the servers already have evened out teams. The people kicked into spec mode leave because they don't want to be spectating, so you're left there waiting for as long as 20 MINUTES! They should've had it so that the one extra player alternates teams to keep it fair, but no, Id Software went with this SUPER flawed ""Auto-Spec"" system which RUINS the game! I don't want to wait 20 MINUTES to play the game! And many QL players are VERY kick happy. If you're new, you're walking on egg shells trying not to get kicked out of certain servers. Not all servers are like that, but LOTS of QL players are very cynical. CS:GO's community isn't as toxic, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. It seriously isn't as bad as QL. Not even close."

Fast paced fun (you have to keep moving and can almost fly across a map by timing your jumps, no crouch camping here), needing 3D awareness and large jump and aerial combat are important, which are usually not a factor in more modern military type FPS like CS or CoD. Much nicer and fun selection weapons pretty all of which are effective. Caters to both high accuracy skill (instant hit at any distance at crosshairs with railgun) and splash anticipation damage (rockets which can be spammed but need good prediciton and chaining togethe to really get kills). Also doesn't require any serious system and the community while smaller than other titles is dedicated and fairly civilized compared to CoD.

Ultimately, the gameplay is fantastic and preserved. The problems come with the extra features which were lost in the transition from being a standalone service to being rolled up into Steam.Gone is the ability to modify your name (straightforwardly, at least). Gone are the prior stats tracking and (seemingly, at least) compatibility with the old Quake 3 maps. Gone are the old friends lists. Etc. I can't remember all the things that are different about this Steam versions, though to my mind they are all small things.Ultimately, it's still the same game that came out sixteen years ago with the core improvements from Quake Live a mere five years ago. Fantastic game that I can't recommend enough, even with the shortcomings!"

I have to say that the addition of voice chat is a great feature though severly underused and the abilitiy to play on all the premium maps that used to only be available to subscribers is also nice.

Oh sure, I had played some games all the way back to the early 90s, but my first real gaming rig was built around the Q3 time. One of the first real games I put on that machine was Q2 and then one day a buddy came over and showed me Q3 and I was blown away. So I have a fondness for that game, especially the add-on, Rocket Arena 3.I haven't done much gaming recently, but when I saw this game was on special, I was interested. I almost didn't buy it because of the reviews, I'm glad I bought it anyway. To me, this game is basically Q3+RA3, version 2 (or remastered). It is everything that was great about Q3: fast, addictive, play, but it's had a nice few visual tweaks. It doesn't look dated, it plays like a brand new game.I can't say much about the other game modes, because I've never really been a fan of anything other than deathmatch, so I just don't play them. That alone will be enough to get you hooked.I think this game is good for anybody who likes arena type shooters, but if you were ever a fan of Q3 and you don't own this one, you HAVE to buy it."

But ELO has to be reintroduced so self-serving, self-centred, elitist (and possibly fat and still pimply) a-holes can play/whine amongst themselves while those who don't have the requisite 500+ hours of gaming time to build their abilities can get a better feel of the game without being pressured to run out and die--and be accused of being a rubbish teammate, or lie in wait for more opportune moments to strike--and be accused of camping.

I have no idea how or why this happened but the AI is significantly worse than in Quake III Arena.CTF is basically unplayable because the full extent of what the AI does is just spawncamping the enemy flag and getting the flag home at a leisurely pace when they get it, no defence or intercepting the enemy flag carrier. And the feature from Q3 where you could give orders or tell a bot to give orders is gone. So a CTF match with bots usually just ends up with them chilling around the empty enemy flag spawn while the enemy team is doing the same. Any points scored are pure coincidence unless you as the only human player do everything yourself.It's still fun enough in FFA although even there the broken AI gets to shine sometimes - in some maps they'll camp at powerup spawns in a really unnatural way, sometimes stay in one place until they die, jump into lava for no reason, it just feels like a straight downgrade from the original game that came out like 18 years ago.Unless the AI gets an upgrade (which is seriously unlikely at this point) I'd recommend sticking to Quake III Arena if you want to play with bots."

So why do I not reccomend this game? Well...Quake live is a remake of quake 3 with some balancing changes made to it some examples of said changes being the machinegun does 5 damage per shot instead of 7, the railgun now does 80 instead of 100(this was arguably a much needed nerf especially on servers that do not have spawn protection enabled), and the lg does 6 damage instead of 8. Because it is a newer game I am sure it also has better netcode than quake 3 although I still don't thing its very good I at least don't seem to notice any blatantly obvious hitreg issues, or any abundance of massive dsync ♥♥♥♥ery. These balancing changes I am perfectly fine with(exept the mg, I actually ♥♥♥♥ing despise how little damage it does) and don't really mind all that much, though there are some q3 purists who refuse to play the game because of these changes(among other things), but in any case there is nothing really mindblowing about these changes that would automatically make everyone drop q3 for it so why is it currently more popular than it and why did people pick it up? The answers pretty simple it used to be free.That's right for 5 years this game was free to play, you didn't need to pay a dime to play the game and it was browser based, it was avaiable on OSX, Linux, and Windows, and asside from the fact that the devs were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dip♥♥♥♥♥ who didn't bother to properly ♥♥♥♥ing market or advertise the game and thus awareness of the fact that it even existed was pretty low there was really nothing stopping people from picking up the game and playing it. Additionally the old netcode of the game and the competition between various sourceports as well as player attrition due to the game having no sense of novelty, and understandably so because by the time quake live rolled around it had been about 11 years since its predecssor was released, quake 3's community was shrinking and somewhat fractured between various sourceports which were incompatible with eachother and people playing on servers using the old protocol. Quake live brought a lot of people together to form a community(well a lot relative to the diminishing playerbases of quake 3 and all arena shooters really)Unfortunately this changed, the game went from free to play to pay to play, while a lot of servers don't use these anymore loadouts were added deathmatch and many of the more casual game modes, and the heavy machinegun which is the most unholy abomination of a weapon I've ever seen in an arena shooter was added to the game; a weapon with more damage per second than the LG and only moderate spread, it competely broke some maps with large open areas. The release on steam saw an increase in the playerbase but unfortunately the pay to play change as well as its removal of linux support which was a miracle in and of itself due to the fact that it never once relied on microcuck's direct x api and always ran on opengl and the♥♥♥♥♥♥balancing changes made some people leave. Ironically enough this game still has a larger playerbase than any other arena shooter currently in spite of this and you can thank its age, the reputation of the company that made it, and the IP because brand recognition and novelty is really the primary thing keeping people from ditching this for a modern quake 3 sourceport, open arena, or xonotic.If you want to do duels  or play clan arena this game has the largest playerbases for those game modes by far, and I hate to say it but i'm sure its worth buying to some people just for that but if you want ctf, ffa, or freezetag there is really nothing stoping you from just pirating quake 3 and playing that because I've never seen any lack of players for those game modes in q3 at least not on NA servers. Whatever, I said I don't reccomend it but its your choice, let the game's community ♥♥♥♥ing die probably in favor of UT 4 which is owned by a company that tencent(the shady chink company that owns Riot games and many monopolies in China and much like Jewgle is on the verge of world domination) has 48 percent of stocks in, or abandon your principles and give money to ♥♥♥♥ing kikes just so that you get to experience the game while it still has a playerbase and maybe by adding another player to the playerbase keep it a bit more alive for a bit longer.Its a really ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ decision to make and I can't really fault one for picking either one or while it pains me to say it simply letting the entire genre die, not with a bang, not even with a wimper but in the werid purgatory its been in for years."

I'm not taking any side now but you are a little greedy and spoiled for making that point. Everything cant be free and it's only 10 euro for gods sake! You get the game, the community and the extra maps if you pick it up in the workshop! Thats alot cheaper than 36 euro a year for premium.And yea, they have reset all players stats and so on but c'mon who cares about stats?!?!?! Back in the old days when people played Quake 3 nobody even knew about stats and achievments and it's still just a small smaaaall part of the game that makes it a little more fun to play. And when the devs shows us that Quake is not about achievments I can relax a little bit inside to know that these guys still pays tribute to the old classics!Putting it in the Steam Community makes it more accessable and easier to build up a community.

Impact damage and various weapon ratings are essentially arbitrary.  You can unload a full clip of a machine gun into an opponent only to be  killed in a single shot by any other weapon. A rocket has less splash damage than a shotgun.After a few hours of play, you will become proficient, but as shooters or even games go, this just isn't worth it.

,Recommended,282440,28772628,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Sp00kberium,"TL;DR - Quake Live is a fun game, go buy it.IntroductionQuake Live is a first-person shooter video game by id Software. It is an updated version ofQuake III Arenathat was originally designed as a free-to-play game launched via a web browser plug-in. On September 17, 2014, the game was re-launched as a standalone title on Steam.GameplayThe gameplay of Quake Live consists of players attempting to kill more of their opponents than any other player or team in a given match. This is achieved by navigating a 3D environment and shooting other players with a variety of weapons, while collecting health, armor, weapons, ammo and various power-ups. As players get more advanced, they use other tricks and techniques such as rocket and strafe jumping. It's movement is the same as Quake III Arena.Gameplay [Part 2]Quake Live has a few fun gamemodes, they consist of:Free For All (FFA): Players engage in a match, where everyone fights for themselves. Whoever hits the frag limit first wins and ends the game. When the time limit expires, player with the most frags is the winner.Instagib: Free for All mode or TDM where players start with only a Railgun. There are no powerups around the map (i.e. health, ammo, weapons). Instagib servers are unranked. Instagib is one shot one kill.Duel: Player versus player (1-on-1) combat. Whoever gets the most frags before the time is up wins.Race: Players start at a point/flag, and they have to get to another point as fast as possible using strafe jumping, rocket jumping, and other techniques, competing against other players. Uses PQL physics, so the player moves faster than usual.Team Deathmatch (TDM): Same rules as Free for All but in this mode, two teams fight each other.Clan Arena (CA): Teambased gameplay where everyone starts fully equipped with full armor and weapons. When fragged, the player must wait for the next round to begin. Players can rocket jump and plasma climb with no health penalty.Players on the same team suffer no damage from their own teammates' weapons.Capture the Flag (CTF): Each team has a base, holding a flag. To earn points and win the game, a player must take the opposing team's flag and return it to their own base, while his team's flag is secure at his own base. Players have the ability to drop the flag at any given time for a tactical play.InstaCTF: Similar to Instagib (i.e. railgun, lack of powerups, etc.) but in a CTF format. Instagib CTF servers are also unranked.1-Flag CTF (1FCTF): Each team fights for control of the white flag in the center, and work to carry it to the enemy flag stand. Unlike in CTF, the flag in 1FCTF, can be thrown between teammates as well as through teleporters.Harvester (HAR): When a player is fragged, a skull spawns from the skull generator. Players must then carry the skulls to the enemy flag stand to earn points.Freeze Tag (FT): A team based game mode combining elements of Clan Arena and Team Deathmatch. Rather than spectating when one is fragged, one is instead ""frozen"", and cannot respawn until a player on their team ""thaws"" them by standing adjacent to them for several seconds. When all players on one team are frozen, the other team wins the round.InstaFreeze (IFT): Similar to Instagib (i.e. railgun, lack of powerups, etc.) but in a FT format. Instagib FT servers are also unranked.Domination (DOM): Capture domination points to earn points for your team. First team to reach the Score Limit wins.Attack & Defend (A&D): Players, spawn equipped with all weapons and full armor, alternate each round Attacking or Defending the flag. Touch the enemy's flag to be awarded a bonus point. Eliminate the opposing team or capture their flag to win the round.Red Rover (Infection): Every player joins either the Red team or the Blue team, and these two teams play one match continuously. In this mode, when a player is fragged, they immediately respawn as a member of the opposing team. This allows for continuous play, instead of having to wait for the next round. The game ends when one team no longer has any players. Once a player frags another, he/she receives a point, and when they die they lose a point. Which ever player at the end of the round has the most points, that player wins that particular match.Do I recommend this game?Quake Live is a updated version of Quake 3 Arena, a classic enjoyed by all. Though id made some drastic changes (SUCH AS MAKING US CHARGE 10 DOLLARS FOR IT), I would say that you should go get it. 8.5/10."

,Not Recommended,282440,33239826,Posted: 4 July,all,Azfaloth,"I'd like to say this game as such is not bad at all. It is smooth and a decent experience. But its not as good as the hype express makes it out to be. I wish there was a neutral option, because then I would have chosen it.Pros:1. Simple with a good learning curve. This means anyone can comfortable play this game, but it takes time and effort to get really good at it. There are however complicated mechanics for advanced movement tricks which you will learn after long practice etc.2. I didn't encounter any bugs.3. Community map support. This is excellent. Many maps are crisp, well designed and perfectly playable.4. Online game play is smooth and doesn't have warping etc at reasonable latencies.5. Game has fast paced smooth hoverboard type of movement, good responsiveness and is quite enjoyable to play if you enjoy that particular flavour of movement. Some may not like it as it  feels like running on ice(without the sliding).6. Many game modes with predefined rules. But you are limited to these predefined gametype sets.7. Nice GUI and menus that utilise Steam API and lobby systems. But very limited options for match settings.Cons:1. No proper mod or mutator support. I want to host a local game with friends and bots using regen, low grav or vampire etc. I can't find anywhere to do so. I can't find any place with mods that add these features. Where do I edit the physics, etc of my game? It seems to be impossible.2. Graphics are absolutely awful. I understand that this was a browser game initially but even then. The player models are all ugly (sometimes neon) blobs. The weapons are bland looking and look too similar when you hold them. The walls are flat, empty and blank in dull colours. Some maps are crisp and nice but there is a lack of texture on the walls.I know the pros like it this way because they can turn everything to dull shades and see their enemies better but for a normal player who's looking for a good experience and not spending 2000 hours practicing pro skills, its terribly ugly. Many of the maps seem to have the exact same textures and don't seem to have much individual character to them.In summary I'd say in terms of graphics Map textures are barebone but still reasonably crisp and bright. Player models and Weapon models are absolute rubbish and ugly af.3. Uninspired weapons. Old time quake fans will burn me at the stake for this, but the weapons really are dull. A shotgun, a rocket launcher, laser beam gun, mandatory energy ball shooter, grenade launcher and 2 machine guns. The railgun is more interesting but thats about it. In my opinion, the guns in Unreal Tournament have so much more character and variety that they feel very iconic. They also look a 1000 times better and more distinct in-game.4. No alternate fire modes. This is probably a matter of opinion but I like guns with alternate fire modes. It adds uniqueness to weapons, complexity and a new level of strategy.5. Why do the maps not tell you how many players are ideal for that map? I end up having to guess how many bots to add because apart from the name and a tiny screenshot, there is literally no description for each map.6. Too expensive considering whats being offered.7. Playerbase isn't large but you can probably find a game or two depending on your region. The problem is that about 80%+ of players are the people with 1000+ hours in-game. Multiplayer is basically not fun unless you play with friends. The pros who have been practicing for years will destroy new players and it requires considerable practice with bots etc in order to even have a nice challenging and fair game.Summary: Buy this if you're a quake fan and just want something that feels like the good old days and caters heavily to your nostalgia. I wouldn't recommend this for a new person who is not attached to the characters, weapons or setting. It feels too simplistic. I will probably play this game occassionally but I don't see myself spending a lot of time on it.Personally, I'd rather play UT2004 or even UT99(GOTYE) over this. They have better graphics, mods, match settings and mutators that can add in pretty much anything that I want in to those games. For something more modern with amazing visuals and maps, I would play Toxikk. I look forward to trying Quake Champions and UT4 later on."

Learning how to boost jump is easy & maps layouts are also easy, but strafes are going to kill you. You might think it would be similar to CS right? Hell no! You can build up lots of speed by strafing but it is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to learn how to strafe. I enjoy a nice little challenge and was hoping for that, but it's really dumb how hard it is to strafe in this game. Anyone can do the basics, but then you realize that if you don't learn how to do these god tier strafes then your screwed. You become easy pickings for any higher level player who has learned this & trust me it won't be fun & you will assume they're cheating. I would only recommend this game to one who has insane patience & is willing to push through the hours of learning strafes. If you don't want to deal with something that obsenely difficuly then you might just want to leave this game & never come back.EDIT: I want to clarify that I just don't like the incredibly steep challenge I kinda recommend this game to those who want an incredibly difficult challenge, but for a casual player like myself I extremely recommend that you don't play this. Like I said above it is a fantastic game, but I just simply don't have the patience to sit in my chair for hours learning how to strafe in this game."

You have to train your aiming and foresight.You have to train gameplay mechanics such as strafe- , circle- and rocketjumps to be fast and agile on the map.I still do train with bots, because I am pretty sure I still can't compete with real people.Maybe this is a downer for new players: If you do not train, you get your♥♥♥♥♥beaten up pretty hard.And if you do, you still get yourself beaten up for a long time, even with bots.But this is rewarding at the same time. Once you get better you feel like you actually achieved something.But I have one big problem: Almost every server shown by the ingame server browser is empty. Once the bots are no real threat anymore, you have to have friends playing it too. No possibility to join a random server in QuakeLive at least for me.

It is pathetic that the community has to create their own ELO system to compensate.

Cnsidering this game used to be browser based and free a while back. I mean sure some people might still get a kick out of this but i still have retail copies of previous Quake titles and still get the same kick out of them with a lan party or ""tweaks"". I'll still recommend it because there's nothing bad about it, i just don't feel it was worth the money though."

I've played a lot of shooters like Unreal Tournament, Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Medal Of Honor, Planetside 2 and more ... and I must say the experience in Quake , once you get good enough to know what you are doing is outstanding. There is no such combination between diversity, balance and entertainment in any other game, I've been playing it for 15+ years and IT NEVER GETS OLD!"

And keep in mind I can run Dusk (a game with a similar art style but a little bit better graphics) at 200 FPS at least. When I go to fullscreen the framerate drops from 200 to ♥♥♥♥ing 15. The same thing happens with Quake (which does this even when i change it to HD still in windowed) and Devil Daggers. If you want to send help, start a discussion with the title '#savecory'.

On the other hand u gotta say, the moving increased it´s playerbase since steam offered it to thousands of players who otherwise might never heard of it.the game itself is like the good old Quake3 Arena - one of my first competitive shooters besides counter strike.fast pace, brutality and tons of of action guaranteed.if you ever wondered where the ego-shooter-online-journey began, get this game and find out yourself. a lot of servers are available from all arround. while i found myself bashing some newbies to this game, i´m also suprised about the amount of good oldschool players. almost every second person played it back in the days, leading to a pretty intense game experience today.this game is not for you if......you can´t cope with dying...you blame others for cheating cuz ur reactions suck...you´re afraid of blood and splattering bodies...you´re a ""CS only kid""other than that: BUY BUY BUY! totally recommend!"

I was really happy they made a browser version of the game, and that I was able to run it in Linux natively... But now that they've dropped Linux support I don't feel like playing this anymore. I think it's absurd you have to install wine now in order to play this game, while it used to run in Linux natively!While Steam is going the right way, ID Software is going downhill... Or should I say Bethesda?I'm not sure who decided not to support Linux anymore, but this is totally not something I would expect from ID Software. Especially not when they decide to go for Steam instead.Other than that, it's one of the best games to play!"

,Not Recommended,282440,30233969,Posted: 27 February,all,Agent BLU,"play this if you enjoy getting kicked from servers and dealing with it's toxic community.This game was free to play before on it's own website, so you would just need to sign up, download the installer so it gets the files and the plugin you need so it runs on your browser.   it was ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant so I would be playing the game like some form of religious practice.   Got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked here and there on duel servers.  I sunk like 200-ish hours into it.  Wasn't the best player either, I completely suck at 1v1 duels because There's so much emphassis on map and all item economy control.good times.The downsides to this game is ofcourse, the toxic players that roam the clan arena or ctf game modes who will ♥♥♥♥♥ at the slightest mistake you make and then you're back at the main menu due to being kicked.   there's also not that many players around, so I sure wonder why is that...You will NOT make any friends here.I don't have a problem with high skill ceiling games but if you've never played a Quake game before or... if you're also a CS player who've dumped hours into that somehow?  You won't last 20 seconds thrown into an arena with seasoned players.   It's all about speedy movement, weapon and other item economy management and pure fighting skills with said weapons.  Duel mode is what this game is all about as well, so if you can't manage in Free for all, what makes you think you'd win a 1v1 against a veteran?  not gonna happen in a million years even if you startered practicing now, because those folks have more than 20 years worth of experience with Arena shooters in general, so if you do manage to get this game, prepare yourself for quite a beating until you become a novice, which more beatings will happen anyways.I do not recommend due to the toxicity of the community, especially during online modes."
