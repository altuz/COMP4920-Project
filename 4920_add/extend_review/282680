I can't wait to see what is added, but until then, this game is worth a good look, and even if you're not into early-access it's certainly worth watching for when it's fully out!"

So far the tactic have been really good, you need to think carefully about what you are going to do else you do fail (I have failed twice on the first stage) and this is how a game like this should be...Graphics are really nice and fit the period and the music is really excellent, not to much of it, but again like the graphics really fits all in...So I would have to say so far its a double thumbs up!!!Great price also, getting a lot here for you money, when did good games become so cheap??"

You might not want to try to play this one during an all-nighter :P10 / 10 Gameplay.  It's deceptively simple.  Can you keep your simple more complex than your opponents simple?  That will be the deciding factor.This game promisesnothingthat it does not deliver.  The price point isperfect.I've owned the game for  while now (admittedly I've been distracted by other shiny things recently), but I've noticed that the dev's deliver updates every week like clockwork.  The few questions and concerns that I voiced on the forums were damn near instantly answered and alleviated by a developer's response.   Who would have guessed - They actually care!If you are a fan of strategy in any way, I think you'll find something to enjoy about Warring States."

,Not Recommended,282680,29765007,Posted: 7 February,all,Desert Fox,I enjoyed this game but now I get an exception error which stops me from progressing everytime I play the second mission of the second chapter and the gate to the fortress is destroyed. Buggy. Stay away.

I bought it the first day that he was out on steam and I can tell you that for now the game, even if he isn't complete, Is great. The game is easy to play but difficult to master. For now, there isn't a tutorial included and no multiplayer (But the creator said that he will implement many feature before the full release of the game) So yeah, for now, the game look a bit like a demo, but I can guarantie that he will soon, very soon, look like a real game.For the creator: for a first game, this game is amazing. Keep up the good work!"

It nails some things and utterly whiffs others.  The sad part is this could have been a great game.  It has the spine, just no muscles or blood.  If you don't like this review, take a number to eat me.P.S.  The Designers routinely lie to the poor saps that have already purchased this.  There is no update in the future.  Learn to live with this."
,Recommended,282680,14379643,"Posted: 7 February, 2015",all,DaxMan71,This game has a very good hex type combat system.  Right now its kinda short just a few scenrios and they are not customizable.  I think if they added a bit more complexity to it i.e. a small economy to add more options in battle. Or customizable maps.  Right now its a great battle game.  I paid 10.99 and its will worth it and if more content were added the value would go up quickly.still so bugs but the devolopers seem to be on the updates so give it a try.

76561198109500046,Recommended,282680,24730009,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,hobotone,"This is a straight up turn based hex strategy game, and that's not a bad thing. The game is good because it doesn't try to be something it's not. The devs concentrated on nailing the basics, and what you get is a well balanced TBS with units that compliment and counter each other well. Units have special abilities that can be used to great effect with intelligent positioning and timing.It's not a game that will haunt your dreams. It lacks in variety and the story is a bit bland, but the mechanics are spot on, so hexy tacticians will enjoy it."
,Recommended,282680,16613600,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,Chon9,"A very good stratergy game that based on ancient China, with match theme of graphics and musics.Since this is the Alpha stage of the development, believe it will grow into a better game.Here are one of my suggestion and what are lacking in this game:-Terrain Status Descriptions: There are a lot building like town and windmill or valley, but non of them are described how it affect my units damage, pretty sure it not only decorations. Suggested that put better description on the terrain upon u mouse over the terrains."
,Recommended,282680,13359569,"Posted: 14 December, 2014",all,The flying general,"Ok so I believe I have played enough to have an understanding of the game and how it works. Firstly, I like the Chinese warring theme (I am more of a three kingdoms strategist myself playing ROTK and Dynasty tactics) but this is a refreshing breath of air. The combat is interesting and intuitive and provides a decent diversity of units. One thing that isn't really a criticism but more of a doubt is the strength of archers. Whilst not strong in damage they seem to drop one morale per shot on any unit they fire on. This is both realistic and sensical however this may turn out to be OP (once again this is more of a worry rather than a complaint). I seem to only have encountered one glitch where I sent my horsemen back through the gate in the second mission (when I was defending) and they flipped out for a few seconds before the game returned to normal. But I have been throughly enjoying this game and am eagerly awaiting the games releaseP.S my name is an ancient chinese reference, I wonder if you know it ;)"
,Not Recommended,282680,25710069,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,FroBodine,"The combat is pretty fun.  Your units have various special attacks and moves that are very cool.  There are flanking bonuses, advantages and disadvantages to units attacking different types of units.  One thing that I don't like is that archers get NO defense when being attacked in melee.  They just sit there and take damage, while dealing zero damage back.  They should be able to at least attack back a little bit.  This is kind of silly and needs to be adjusted.The few campaign scenarios that I have played so far have been interesting and offer different types of challenges, which is a good thing.  I look forward to playing the rest of the missions.The developers, however, are glacially slow, and they are absent from the forums for extended periods of time.  Lately, they rarely, if at all, respond to questions on their own game's Steam discussion board.So, the combat is solid, and enjoyable.  It still needs quite a bit of play balancing.  The AI is not very difficult to beat (so far).  Multiplayer doesn't seem to work at all.  I hosted a game, and my Steam friend never saw it in the game list, nor could I invite him to join my game.  So, that seems broken right now, and the developers aren't responding when we ask them how to get multiplayer working.I hope the developers pick up the pace and finish the game soon.  It has a lot of potential, but it's currently hindered by play balance issues, multiplayer not working, and non-responsive developers.  So, I cautiously recommend this game.[Update 2/23/2017] - I am changing my review to ""Definitely Not Recommended"".  These developers have completely disappeared, leaving this game unfinished.  They no longer respond on the Steam forum.Please stay far away from this game.  I feel bad for ever recommending this game.  Developers like these guys are what gives early access a bad rap.No Bueno."

Normally in some games I turn sound off but not this game.The graphics are fine. At the highest resolution I saw ghosts for each playable icon.The game is in early access and it still needs lots of work.The game has potential but atm I could not recommend it but with fixes that would change.
