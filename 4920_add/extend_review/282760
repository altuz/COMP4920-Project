,Recommended,282760,9844907,"Posted: 17 April, 2014",all,Onomato,This game is simply fantastic. I have always been a fan of music games but this one might just be one of the best ones I have played so far. The atmosphere this game offers is simply incredible and can only be explained by letting someone actually play it. It relaxes and gives insight on the many facets music has and exists of. Definitely recommend it!

But be prepared for some pretty difficult puzzles!However, for those with a history of extensive musical training, don't expect to use much thought process. I myself am a music composition major in university, and have been playing music since the age of 2. Needless to say, I was able to complete all the puzzles with total ease, without using any hints or switching to individual instrument layers. If you think you would be in a similar position as me, either wait until more difficult puzzles are introduced into the game (the devs are considering adding some more challenging levels), or simply get the game now, and use it as a method to relax.On a side note, I hear there is a new extention or software coming soon called Circuits Composer, which means that the community might be able to provide us with some truly challenging puzzles, possibly even for music graduates.My final word is that I fully recommend this game to people who don't have impossibly sharp ears, as you'll be developing your hearing abilities through levels that you may find yourself stuck on for hours. And even for the others, I would still recommend the game, given that you keep in mind my comments above.I'll be looking forward to any future updates!"

Slowly got a bit more interesting, then they introduced the loops portion of the gameplay and that's where the game completely broke down from a musical puzzle to a frustrating chore.For a musician, this game provides no real challenge or gameplay. Simply listen to each sample and figure out where it needs to go, then when you think you've solved it, just hit play and fast-forward through. There's no incentive to actually listen to the entire piece or all samples together. It's much easier and faster to figure out each ""layer"" (as they call it) and put in the proper samples.You may notice that I haven't even spent a full hour on the game but that's because I finished around half the levels and then the ""loop"" mechanic got SO tedious that I just had to stop. It wasn't an engaging or challenging mechanic. It was just endless tedium. And the number of loops that you need to figure out has no meaning musically as there are no measures or BPM or anything. So it's a matter of figuring out how many times each sample loops audibly. And when you've heard these repeating samples over and over again, watching paint dry sounds like a much better afternoon!So get it if it's on sale and get it if you're not a musician."

And that's basically what circuits is all about--chaining musical samples together to reproduce the default piece of each level. While the music samples are pretty good, as a game where the player simply tries to reproduce what he hears, I didn't find it all that fun or engaging.As I played the game, I was thinking that the user should be able to make his own musical scores based on the samples provided. And apparently there is a Circuits Composer feature coming soon which I think will make this game a fun little music generator. So I give it a thumbs up for a future unreleased feature. The base game isn't all that impressive, but it's hard not to recommend it given the sale price."
,Recommended,282760,11101805,"Posted: 6 July, 2014",all,Kassan6ra,"Circuits is essentially a music puzzle game, where you get to reconstruct melodies by putting little sound hubs in their right positions to build a track. The game mechanic is based on you listening to certain melodies and then identiying the proper sounds and putting them in the right order. Note that you will probably have to listen to some parts repeatedly to get them right, since it is something not everyone has the patience for.The difficulty is generally not high, except towards the end (levels 24-25). You can, however, choose to *not* break up the music into layers in the previous levels, so it will be harder for you to distinguish the different sounds playing at the same time. The game is a tad short, I finished it in roughly 4 hours, but that can vary depending on the person. However, the developers have promised more levels in the near future, so this might change.Overall, I would say that circuits is worth your time.  It is simple, yet elegant and relaxing if you are generally musically inclined. It is hard to comment beyond personal preferences for this type of game, since I feel it is mostly a matter of taste, so if you think what I have mentioned so far is something you will like, you will probably enjoy this game as I have."

However, after completing the first 10 levels, I found it was little more than placing the appropriate samples ino the correct places. When you place them wrongly, it simply tells you that something is wrong and you have to go back, find it and fix it. There's no idication of why what you did was wrong musically, in terms of harmony or scales or chords. There's no tuition. And so I don't think they achieved what they wanted in this game."

Who knew?Actually, it's a *fantastic* little indie music game great for any musician, person with musical talent, or even anybody who just wants to improve his/her musical ear.  The ""circuits"" are just the visual manifestation of how the music plays out-- pay no heed-- it will make sense once you try the game.Basically, you listen to some synth music, and with your ear (assisted by optional in-game hints), figure out which chords go where in the progression; which sections are looped (and how much), what the beat patterns are (and how they are repeated).  I don't consider myself a huge fan of techno/synth/trance (some of it I like), but I found all of the music pleasant to listen to.There are 25 levels-- whether it's a long game or a short game is completely based on how you are able to figure out the levels.  For achievement-hunters, if you have a great ear (or don't mind using some in-game or Steam Guide hints), you can 100% it with relative ease...there's nothing unreasonable.I bought it ""on sale"" for $1.19, but it's only $3...less than a coffee-- and it has trading cards you can sell or use.  Give it a try and support these indie devs.  I'm just hoping for a Circuits 2![Edit:  One more thing:  if you like the music, the soundtrack is available as MP3s in your game folder, which is something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Circuits\OST.]"

I bought circuits because I had read it was ""like SpaceChem with music"". For those who do not know, SpaceChem is a very difficult puzzle game that gets more and more rewarding the farther you get. Circuits, on the other hand, only gets more frustrating, because each puzzle is solved by playing bits of the sample music over and over until you have moved each proper sound into place. The game is not long, I have gone under an hour and completed about 60 - 75 percent of the game, and I can not bring myself to finish it because the gameplay is so tedious.

Ultimately, the game is a test is your aural detection and mimicry, and not much else.While the game is titled Circuits, the gameplay relates to circuitry in only a superficial (using the symbol for ground, etc) manner - there is no actual relation to circuit design (ANDing or ORing the audio signals, for example) in order to create the music, which is somewhat disappointing. In each level, you are given a series of tiles each of which contain a single musical track. Along the progress bar of the ""circuit"", there are locations where you drop those tiles in order to match them to the given audio track. Sometimes you'll have to loop individual tracks or groups of tracks, and there are ""switch""es where you choose one track over another, but in truth they only serve to make the levels easier, as the tiles are in fixed locations on them, which limits the areas those tiles can be used.Ultimately, this is a game of mimicry/memory. The last couple levels provide some degree of challenge within that constraint, but for the most part I didn't find the game particularly challenging/fun. The music itself was generally pleasant, and if there was something more to the game than ""match what you hear"" I would probably switch this to a recommend. But as is, I don't think most people would overly enjoy the game - if a game of matching audio tracks to one another sounds like fun, then by all means.I'd recommend not splitting the layers in order to provide a higher level of difficulty - you'll probably get more out of it."

It's fairly simple, with some added twists such as loops, switches, and repetitions, but very addictive.  The puzzles are interesting and increase in difficulty, but the game overall is rather short (the 25 levels should really only take you a few hours to complete).The music included is atmospheric and relaxing, and will largely be what hinges on your appreciation of the game.  If you enjoy chillstep, you'll be sucked into the game, if not, you might find it grating (and possibly repetitive, even though the game really isn't).  Which to me leads to the only real downside of the game.  If it had a sandbox mode, an editor, or the ability to incorporate your own music into the game, it would be perfect.  As it stands, it's still a solid music puzzle game, but it's dependent on whether you enjoy the music already presented in the game."

They introduce new concepts to the puzzles very well, giving you time to adjust. My favorite part is the musical portion, it's unique (at least to me) in a puzzle game to have it all reliant on sound. Nothing is more satisfying than correctly matching up the sound bits to the song, piece by piece, and playing it as a whole and hearing it match solidly to the original. The composer is fun, even with next to no knowledge on how to make music you can throw in a few random things on the track list and it'll probably sound close to decent, I haven't experimented with it too much but I look forward to it. The game itself is fairly priced, if you enjoy music based games or puzzle games, you'll feel it was well worth it, if not for the game itself but just to mess around in the composer (especially if you caught it on a sale, like I did.)"

You will love it if you are a musician but you'll hate it if you have absolutely no musical ear (as the whole gameplay is based on that). The only annoying thing is the fact that you play only with the mouse. There is two play modes (one for the music you have to reconstruct and one for what you have reconstructed yet) so you always have to move the cursor and click on play buttons and layers buttons that are apart from each other. With such a simple gameplay, it would have been easy to add keyboard shortcuts (spacebar?) for play modes, and 1,2,3,4 keys for layers. That's the only tiny thing missing from this game.Gameplay tip :Reconstruct each songs layer by layer before listening to the whole thing, it gaved me more eargasms to discover the song after reconstructing it. It feels more like you've made it instead of just copying it."

However, what it does differently is every piece of the puzzle is a short piece of music, which you need to put into the correct position to recreate the whole score for the level. You might think this is quite simplistic, but if you are not a very musically driven person like me, it may be somewhat difficult to differ which piece goes where, due to some of them sounding very similar. The game slowly introduces different mechanics like layers, looping and switches, which increases the difficulty if you don't listen carefully.All in all this simplistic game is a very cheap gem on the steam store that forces you to listen to be able to solve the puzzle instead of staring and observing like many other games but can still be quite challenging and time consuming, although time is not wasted when you finally get to hear the masterpiece you put together."

All I'm feeling after a dozen levels of Circuits is the urge to rant about game design.Listening to the same samples over and over and over again to figure out where to place them is boring. Activation of nodes is entirely linear (at least so far) and there is nothing clever you can do beyond just grinding each level out. Gameplay is often slow, and the controls feel awkward. Level transitions goes on too long and are unskippable. There's a speed up feature to skip playing the entire song once you have a solution but it is still too slow.And, to top it off, I personally found the samples and songs almost grating to my ears."

However it says on the game itself that this was created for headphones so unless you don't read it you should already know.Overall this game is well worth more than the price you have to pay.

It is less about challenge and more about patience and investment, and it feels far from rewarding.It has a nice visual presentation, but it does little to change the slow, monotonous nature of the puzzles.

,Recommended,282760,16746393,"Posted: 27 June, 2015",all,KingIsaacLinksr,"A Paladin’s Steam Review: Circuits. Challenging yet Relaxing Short Rhythm GameGenre: Minimalist Audio PuzzlerDeveloped and Published by: Digital TentaclePlatform: Windows, MacOSX, Linux and iOS.Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by MyselfGame OverviewThe main mechanic of Circuits is a pseudo circuit board play field with spots to place circles. These circles are individual beats or sounds that you have to put in the right order and time to match the original song. Each spot has a symbol to give you a clue as to which circles goes there. You’ve also got the option to listen to individual levels of the music: the beats, the melody and the harmony. Once you think you’ve got it, you’ll play the track in full and see if the game agrees with your solution. There’s no leaderboards, not a lot of achievements nor any difficulty sliders. It’s just a casual rhythm game to enjoy, which I did. It was satisfying to figure out how each song worked within the context of Circuits. It’s an overall neat idea and keeping it as short as they did was a smart move on their part.Audio Puzzle DifficultyThere’s twenty five tracks in total that you can solve at your own pace. They slowly ramp up in difficulty over time as new mechanics are introduced but it’ll never get overly difficult to figure out a solution. You’re also given tips every level that’ll help you out of a tough spot. I found that I could complete Circuits without needing to look online for solutions. It just takes some patience and quite a few listenings.Circuits ComposerThere’s a composer track editor included with Circuits to allow you to make your own tracks. It’s more of a really lightweight version of Audacity. All you can do is drag pre-recorded tracks from the library and stick them on a 8-track board. You can’t add or subtract tracks, you can’t play around with fading, crossfading or any other number of audio fiddling options. It’s more of a causal editor that will let you slap a song together in a short amount of time. There’s plenty of music to choose from in the library and no doubt you could make some unique stuff with it. Just don’t expect a full version of Garageband. It’s a neat little feature for people who’re casually interested in messing around.PC Settings MenuAll settings are in the pre-game launcher. It’s the standard Unity setup of resolution options, fullscreen and windowed, graphics quality slider and keybindings. There’s really not a lot to comment on here because it’s not a graphically demanding game nor is there any reason to really play around with any of the settings. Since the game is mouse driven, you won’t be changing any of the keybindings either. The UI is minimalist but functional. I didn’t experience any performance problems or crashing during my time with Circuits. It felt rock solid the entire time.Final ThoughtsFor a couple of hours, you’ll get a fun little audio/rhythm puzzle game that can be rather tricky to solve. You’ll need a good pair headphones or speakers to get the full enjoyment out of this title. The soundtrack’s moody electronic and orchestral-like sounds are rather enjoyable. But I have really weird tastes so keep that in mind. I haven’t got any complaints about it and if you’re looking for a casual rhythm game, Circuits fills that niche quite nicely.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade"

That doesn't mean, however, that this is Dance Dance Revolution episode 99. This is quite a different and innovative little game.The gameplay is about first listening to a track as it should sound, and then reconstructing it using sound bites that you place on the ""circuit"" in order to finish and play the track.As in any other puzzle game you have to use your brain, but your ""input"" for solving it isn't so much visual elements on a board, but instead sounds, recognition of small variations, and utilizing your short term memory from when you listen to the track (you can do that at any time) to finding the right sound bite/puzzle piece. This gameplay mechanic is quite innovative!-- Should you buy it? --If you find the concept, and perhaps the trailer, even moderately intriguing, then yes. I think you will be positively surprised.If you are interested in music, but not usually puzzle games, then still yes.Casual gamers, and people who don't usually play puzzle games, might get a bit frustrated at times, but it is cheap, so take the opportunity to try something different.A possible caveat is that your skill in solving the puzzles is quite independent from previous (puzzle) game experience, since it depends on your ability to ""hear"" and understand the music, and you can't really know until you try it. But you probably have a pretty good idea about whether you are ""musical"" or not.- Time to finish all 25 levels (currently) is about 3 hours, and perhaps an additional hour if you want to complete the most challenging achievement.- If you want all achievements, then I recommend reading the requirement for ""Golden Ear"" and solve it as you pass through the levels (or make a note of which levels you haven't solved in this way).- The game includes the soundtrack, which probably isn't something you'd listen to on repeat, but it is pretty cool."

You listen to pieces of individual instruments on a particular song and place each piece to where it fits chronologically, in order to make the song flow right.

I like how the difficulty goes up the longer the clip. so instead of having just 25 levels I think it needs a  bit more try aiming for 40 try to go for the ending levels being entire songs. I was a tad dissappointed when I found the OST and they were the clips from the game, in game I thought the devs took a clip from a song and had us recreate it. I understand that maybe thoses were finished songs, but to me they just didn't sound finished or they sounded like they started halfway into a song. I read some other reviews and one caught my eye, a sandbox mode would be reallly great, just use the sounds you have in game and  have the community make some levels and put them in workshop for download. It would add to the game, and would create more replayablility. Also it would be really cool if the devs added a more diverse set of music, all the music sounded the same except for a few songs. I understand that making a game is difficult, and this game is really really cool. I just wish there was more to it. I still reccommend it, I had fun with it and it really challenged me.

There are a couple of different gameplay elements, but they don't provide any real variety.If the puzzles had been more difficult and complex, it might have been worth it. As it was, they felt less like a challenge and more like an exercise in tedium. Instead of getting difficult, they just got longer.The last two puzzles were the most interesting, since the game forces you to figure things out by listening to all of the song layers at once. You have to listen very closely to pick out the parts of the song that are relevant to the pieces you're trying to place. Unfortunately, even here, it became frustrating, simply because some of the sounds were so completely masked by the other sounds that it felt like I had no choice but to guess.The idea is very clever! I like the concept of using sound this way. It's just the execution that felt unsatisfying. More meta-modifiers like the loops and repetitions and better use of the control switches so they required more thought about the overall structure of the song rather than just the next sound clip would have helped immensely."

If you want it for the music then yea ok this might work for you, but if you are thinking of buying this because it's a ""challenging puzzle game"" don't waste your money.Let me start by saying that the only thing about it that is to do with circuits is the earth symbol at the end of the line. Poor choice of title really, should of gone with something a bit more music orientated. But a poor choice of title is not worth giving a bad review, no.The fact that it boasts ""challenging puzzle"" makes me laugh. The first 23 levels I completed in the time played were simplistic and easy. You listen to a music strand and match it with the one that sounds the same, thats all it is. Count the repeats and set it to that many... not very puzzling (puzzled = ""unable to understand""). The only challenge was trying to decipher the 1 decibel (it's an exaggeration before you start screaming at me) between the multiple choice music strands, which I will admit was challenging but again easy to get around.Now the music was ok, the mojority of it i liked however there were bits were I felt like my ears were bleeding and the vocals were crap. I really don't think there should of been any vocals at all.The last 2 levels I didn't complete because their idea of making something more of a challenge or harder is to take out the main game mechanic. Let me explain, in game you have a sytem to choose which type of strand to listen to so you don't get then all mixed together when trying to decipher which one goes where. This gets taken out the game on the last 2 levels so you have to listen to the 3 different types of strands plus the background music and try and make out which one of all these 20 different music strands that sound very similar is the right one to go in that slot. It's a terrible shortcut to making the game harder without much effort.All in all I really don't think anyone should buy this game, short, easy and borring it's not much fun.

Although the music of each level is a bit short, you still can be a creative person while listening to the loops and then try to imagine what's gonna be played through the headphone. Somehow you will find yourself immersing in the music around, unlike other people saying, I think people don't need to be a bachelor of music degree(funny, right?), don't even need to master the basic theory, just stay tuned and listen to all loops intently, every small distinction you find will excite yourself as a reward.Combining kaleidoscopic spots with electronic loops that not only touches but also impresses players, this game has become the most exhilarating one I've had in my list. I just wanna say that if the producer releases the full soundtrack, I will definitely go for it.Enjoy it! You won't regret.Edited: The new composer is just a mini music producer, I enjoy it pretty much!"

So that kind of puts the kibosh on this game.I tried it out myself and I am sorry, but the game is boring and tedious. It probably does not help that I am tone deaf. I think there are good production values to this game, but I just can't get into it.I feel like the name of the game is misleading since it makes you think electronics or something, but really it's a musical puzzle game where you have to put snippets of sound in the correct order to make the song play correctly.I got this game for 74 cents, but still can't recommend it and I am probably not going to go back to playing it anymore."

It is a good ear training exercise, and I have found the music overallto be beautiful and well done.

Like the First 25 are Stage on and the second stage will have 25 songs again, abit longer than the ones of the first stage.And in the Third Stage maybe full sounds.The last and Fourth Stage could  be random generated Songs, or like you can do in Audiosurf, search your directorys to find your own songs and then you can play them.Furthermore it would be nice, if you could implement some capture device, so you can capture the finished songs, but that´s just the nonplusultra, not necessary XD.Really good is the idea of diffrent colors, but maybe a new color brings more light into the themes :D.The Hints could be made better, mbe adding difficulties, the easier the more help you get.And at some Songs (i stuck a long time at song 24 and 25 XD) you could implement a ""time Bonus"", if it takes too long, the player get´s new hints.A new Tool: not only sort the tones/themes in a song by color, but sort by tone high. I for myself have no problem to listen out what high/deep a tone/theme exactly has, but many of my friends failed due they play not any instruments _:)-.The last Thing i have to say:This Idea is GREAT.

,Recommended,282760,11521071,"Posted: 2 August, 2014",all,triph4mm3r,"Not a bad game.  Circuits is kind of a puzzle game for musicians.  The game plays a small musical piece and this instrumental piece is layered so that each layer is a different part of what you're hearing.  The drum beats on one layer, high tones on another layer and then chords on another, (that kind of thing) all make up everything you're hearing.  You can listen to the musical piece all together or you can listen to it each layer at a time.The game plays a short piece of music that you can graphically see run like a time line on the screen and you're supposed to replicate what you're hearing with the buttons and tools placed within that time line.  If you can't remember the musical piece that was played... the game will play it again and you can listen to each layer so you can zero in on the part you can't remember.Like I said, it's not a bad game.  However; I found the game to drag a bit because sometimes the part you need to remember is at the end of the timeline and you have to listen to the whole thing just to get to that last part of the time line.  If you zero in on that one layer... and there's nothing happening 'til the end... you have to listen to the whole thing in basic silence 'til you get to that one part.  It makes the game drag.  A fast forward button (like the one that's used when you find a solution to the puzzle) would solve the problem.I'd recommend the game for musicians out there who are prolly used to analyzing music and breaking down the layers of what you're hearing but I think others will get bored real quick waiting the time line out.  I found myself wanting an FF button within 5 minutes.  I got the game SUPER cheap so buy it on sale if you do buy."

,Not Recommended,282760,28842524,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Tesuji,"I don't recommend Circuits, but it's probably because I am not the real target audience for this game. The core of the game revolves around listening to a song and then putting the samples into place to re-create the song that is given to you. I have to give credit to the developers for slowly easing you into the difficulty by adding different mechanics throughout the game and it seems to be intending for you to get an idea of how music is created in different programs. They've even added their own music composition software, Circuits Composer, to allow for a sandbox mode to play with the samples they give you in game to create your own songs. The fact that they included this with the core game and not as an additional purchase is definitely a plus.However, the reason I do not recommend it is because I come from a background of working in music composition and radio where I have experience working with this software already. Circuits almost functions better as teaching software for programs like Fruity Loops and Audacity. For me, Circuits was nothing more than a slog of listening a few times to determine where the samples belong and then dropping them into place which became very tedious very quickly. If you're interested in an introduction to music production through a UI that builds in difficulty, you'll eventually find yourself working in something similar to what many producers use in studios today. This is the real purpose of this game, which I do not think is well described. If you already have knowledge of how production software works, Circuits is probably not the game for you."

Also, at the beginning, it seemed like you were intending to color code the different pieces of the music, with red as lead and piano, yellow as techno or background and purple as the percussion and rythym. However, this concept isnt held through. The transition between levels is excrutiatingly painful on the eyes, going from a bright white/gray immediately to black, lasting just long enough for your eyes to adjust and then back to bright murdered my eyeholes.

It's essentially a very simple music sequencer, 25 short pieces of music (chillstep, ambient) with a ""stem"" that acts as a timeline. You're given a handful of nodes, each containing short musical phrases or snippets of percussion, and you have to put them on the correct placeholders along the stem. You can play the entire piece of music and drag the timeline slider to any point, so it's pretty easy at first to build the song. Later levels get a bit more difficult, with subtle chord differences or slight variations in note timing, and nodes or sequences of nodes that must be allocated a certain amount of repeats, but unless you're tone deaf it's not too difficult. It's a neat concept, the music is worth a listen (the OST is included), and it's probably a fun way of learning the very basics of song composition.

The user is presented with a circuit diagram and a number of different audio samples which must be placed in the correct spots along with the use of a few different mechanics (repeat, loops, switches) in order to reproduce a 15 to 30 second song. There are 25 levels in total which I was able to finish in about 4 hours.The aesthetic of the user interface is spartan which I personally liked. I had mixed feelings about the music. I liked certain parts of each song, but I can only say that I actually liked about 5 out of the 25 songs in their entirety. A lot of the songs make liberal use of the vocoder, which is something that I absolutely detest in any music. Having to listen to those particular samples multiple times in order to place them correctly was unpleasant for me.I enjoyed my time with this game for the most part, but I do not feel the urge to go back and redo any of the puzzles."

It's a nice experience, although short and not too challenging gameplay wise, it's a relaxed casual music game with great music that's enjoyable to listen to.Sadly, it gets boring to listen to the same song over and over while trying to find out what node you were wrong with, and when you finally get it right, you'll just skip the song because you've heard it so many time until that moment of actual victory.I think it would've been better if the song were to remain 'bland' (only the nodes you put in, no extra music), and when you actually try to play it (to check if you were correct) it adds all the other layers, to feel some measure of success and progression.Apart from that, having actual parts of music development that don't occur from the nodes you've placed is rather confusing at points and there should at least be a way to disable that while testing out your song (apart from switching between layers).At times it was hard to figure out which node was playing what type of music, and some nodes were mostly too quiet to hear and comprehend which required me to guess and check with the hint tool if I was correct or not.The game doesn't really have any replayability, because once you've finished all 25 levels (I think I finished them in about an hour or two), you've heard all the songs and you wouldn't really go back to play those songs again.There should be some sort of difficulty level per song (maybe something like 'easy' 'medium' 'hard') which include more/less nodes according to the difficulty, and more song complexity accordingly. Some sort of rating (according to time or some other measurement of performance) may improve replayability.Lastly, a 'free-creation' mode would've been great, using all the nodes in the game to create your own levels or songs to share, or just to enjoy on your own. That would've changed the game immensly, making it a whole new experience.Overall, it's a pretty nice game, lacks in a lot of respects, but for $3 it's pretty worth it just to give it a try, and hope the developers will make a 2nd version with some gameplay improvements :P"

After reading the decription, I was pleasantly surprised. Being a musically-inclined individual, the idea of a replicate-the-song musical puzzler has always interested me. I was also very shocked by the price. I mean, less than five dollars for 25 levels? Sign me right up!The game has no story. It's an abstract puzzle-solving game where you must listen to a song and try to recreate it with the musical nodes you are given. As you progress, different mechanics will be added including looping individual nodes, looping groups of nodes, and switches which allow you to chose between several pre-placed nodes. Each level is comprised of lines and symbols similar to those you'd find on a circuit diagram, hence the game's name. Surprisingly enough, the game has quite an atmosphere, with the soundtrack being an amalgam of orchestral (strings, piano, brass, and even a flute solo in one level) and electronic drums and synthesizers. Some songs even have vocal parts, but in most cases they are heavily-processed beyond recognition. The music certainly creates an eerie mishmash of the organic and the cybernetic. Despite this stark contrast, nothing feels out of place. It all fits together remarkably well. Not only that, but the soundtrack comes free with purchase of the game. I mean come on! You'll pay less for this entire game than you will for other games' soundtracks by themselves. That's a steal in my book.Now, I admit the game is not for everyone for obvious reasons. Of course, you don't need to know the exact difference between a C and a C#, but there are some points in the game where your choices sound remarkably similar. I remember one particular scenario where you had to select from five nodes using a switch. They were all sustained string chords and all had the same pitch. The only difference between them was the timbre, or ""tone quality/brightness."" These switchers seem to be a stumbling block for a lot of people and I can understand why. The game does offer two types of hints--one which places a node in its correct position and another which marks incorrectly-placed nodes--along with a ""layer system"" where you can separate the track to only play the red, yellow, or purple-colored nodes, and while I never had to use them, I thank the developers for including such a feature.The developers have promised more levels and possibly more mechanics in the future and I can't wait to see what they come up with. Overall this game is pretty good for one I wouldn't have even known existed had I not been browsing Steam at the right time. This game gets 6 S's out of 7. Highly recommended."

You'd think the point of a game like this would be to split each song up into tracks so that you can reconstruct it on a track-by-track basis. But each ""song"" is just a succession of disconnected noises, so all you're doing is playing Simon Says: you listen to a sound, and then you find the same sound in your inventory and put it in the slot. Even when you have to ""loop"" sounds, they're still separated from everything else (and the songs have no rhythm), so this is just a matter of counting how many times the sound repeats and then punching in that number. Furthermore, because the music is all droning electronica, trying to tell the difference between some of the sounds is extremely annoying. And if you're having trouble, the only tool at your disposal is a hint button that tells you which parts you have wrong, rather than something like a mixing board that would actually help you identify the sounds, which is what the game is pretending to be about.

You place the sections in the right order to reconstruct it. The challenge comes from having multiple instruments playing simultaneously so you can either use the layer tool to separate the strands, or try to do it without separation for the Golden Ear achievement.DifficultyTwo advanced mechanics are introduced: looping, where you repeat single parts or whole sections; switching, where you have to select between a number of set paths - I found this tricky and I admit to using trial and error on a couple of occasions.I have no musical training but I think I have a good ear. I didn't find any of it too difficult but it was a comfortable mental workout; the Golden Ear playthrough became quite hard towards the end. I didn't feel tempted to give in and google solutions at any point, which is always my acid test with puzzle games.GraphicsClean visuals; good use of colours to separate the instrument classes; nice logical layout.MusicIt's all synthesized crap with not a sniff of any guitar.

There are 400+ projects so plenty of extra content to be had. I was not able to load any of it but the discussion threads are busy so I suspect this is due to me being on Linux.I would say the full price is about right but I think it will regularly be on sale due to the upcoming Circuits 2 so it might be worth waiting for a price drop.Steam5 trading cards (so an easy badge) and 15 achievements, quite respectable.VerdictAs a puzzle game I recommend it.

Would not recommend.tl;dr: poor navigation, no ""quick check"" button, poorly written music, system that results more in ""guess and check"" instead of musical analysis.When I first heard about a music-puzzle game, I was very eager to try it out. I have been playing music for over 14 years on several instruments and I also have several years of experience composing. The idea of a version of The Talos Principle or Portal geared towards the musically keen was almost too good to be true.However, this game is much less about music; it plays like a ""find the 10 differences"" puzzle.When you get into the game, you have two basic tools to solve the puzzle. You have the main circuit with blank sockets, upon which you try to ""assemble"" the piece of music. You also have the master track at the bottom of your screen, upon which the music sockets rest. You can also kind of organize the pieces around the circuit if you would like to group them up before putting them into the puzzle (and you can't even use the entire screen for it).Ideally, you listen to the master track. You then click on a piece and know where it should go on the board. Once you have all of the pieces, you listen back to compare and then you know if there is any error or not.What actually happens is that the segments of the songs are either a few notes that barely differ or just some strange arbitrary noises. This means that you cannot really analyze it from a musical standpoint and get away with it. Since the differences between the false sockets and the real sockets are so minute, you find yourself trying to jump to the master track and listening to that portion and then directly comparing it while it's still in your ear.Speaking of which, navigating the master track is awful. You can kind of correspond with it on a the circuit, but you can't bookmark it and you can't isolate a certain section to concentrate on it.When you go to check the puzzle, you can play it or you can hold the mouse button to ""accelerate"". This becomes really tedious when you're trying to check for a single error, because you are wasting 15-20 seconds for no reason. There is nothing wrong with a ""check song"" button.The music in the game is really bad. It sounds like a lumped mix of ideas that have almost no order and maybe 2 seconds of thought to them. It's like the Zedd/Skrillex notepad of random ideas that they came up with during lunch and then never thought about again.There is also a very minute mechanic of ""repeating"" a piece, which is quite illogical. In music, phrases/ideas can consist of 4 notes, 2 measures, 4 measures, 8 measures, etc. Sometimes, the same idea is 4x2 measures (4 repeats of the same 2 measures). Early in the game, sometimes that idea is isolated in one segment, and the others might express it as 4 (that you have to repeat twice) or as 2 (which you have to repeat four times). This is not skillful; it is tedious.Also, by the time I've finished ""writing"" the song, I'm sick of hearing it and don't even remember what the entire thing was supposed to sound like. In fact, it's possible to beat the game without listening to a single one of the songs in its entirety.The idea is good, but this game is simply not there yet."

The game has nothing in relation to Circuits of the electronic variety in any way. There are 25 songs that you spend a great deal of time trying to replicate for the very short length of music. In 3 hours, I'd completed the game. Fortunately not very expensive. In most songs you're allowed to switch 'layers' so you're only hearing for example the melodies or the bass, so you can limit what you're hearing and make it easier to replicate. But the last two songs are the most complex pieces of music in the game, and don't allow you to limit the layers like you've been taught the rest of the game. There are parts in both of the last two levels that are so complex with so many instruments at varying loudness that it is impossible to make out the instruments you're actually trying to replicate.

Unless you are use to playing and reading music, Circuits is a challenging little game that one can pick up/put down easily."
,Not Recommended,282760,18322114,"Posted: 4 October, 2015",all,Maxmetpt,"Circuits is basically Simon Says, with some fantastic presentation and some very puzzling design choices.Being a game about music, it's right up my alley. I pay a lot of attention to how music is generally used in video-games, so I was somewhat eager to play the game.Unfortunately, despite it being great in a lot of areas, it fails in the most important part: the game. The game and the part that music plays in it is incredibly disappointing, and, to me, it ruins the overall experience.In this game, you are given a level, with some ""holes"" and pieces that you can use to fit those holes. Each piece plays a musical phrase, and your job is to reconstruct the song.You can play the song at any time and go forward/backward to listen to a certain part exclusively.... And that is the game. ""Monkey see, monkey do"". Or, well... ""hear"". There's nothing remotely interesting in how music is played. It's just a bunch of isolated tracks you have to place in the song.This could be interesting. Music is a creative field, so, perhaps, we could have some similar tracks and try to make our own song... but no! The game often has very similar tracks, playing the same sets of notes, with a very very slight change, but you need to put everything in its ""right"" place. ""Right"" meaning simply the place intended by the designers.If you misplace something, the game will tell you that ""something is wrong"" and you'll have to figure out what.You have hints and you can isolate tracks (except in the last few levels, where the track isolation is taken out, for some reason... """"difficulty"""" purposes, I assume), so you can get help if you make a mistake. But... then the game is telling you what to do.Now, what's the biggest problem with the game?Well, you don't construct the song from zero. You have several tracks already playing. This would be fine, as a baseline for the song, but here's the problem: the backing track is often much louder than the tracks you're trying to fit in the song.Meaning that you often hear the backing track when you're trying to hear what's missing, and it gets frustrating. If you can barely hear what you need, what's the point?!And this happens a lot!Then, there's the second biggest problem. Some of the tracks that you have to choose from are incredibly similar! They play exactly the same notes, in exactly the same intonation, with very similar effects. But perhaps one more note (that fits!) is added, very lowly into the mix, and that track is ""wrong"". This is a very arbitrary wrong. The notes played are the same. The track fits the song just as well as the ""correct"" one. So where's the problem? Why can't I choose it?It's a very artifical way of creating difficulty. And it completely defeats the point in have a game about music, to me.In each level, you have X tracks, and you use them all. So, they're all notes that fit the song, there's no room for error, in that regard. It's literally just about listening (and trying very hard to discern the sound you're looking for amidst the other louder tracks) and putting the only piece in place that fits.... It's really puzzling the me why this plays like it does. Maybe it's a very personal thing, but it seems to destroy what makes music amazing! There's no creativity. It's like a puzzle with every piece masked. The game hides information to increase difficulty, with no real reason.I think I'm just hitting the same keys (heh) at this point. I really dislike the game itself, it seems to go against most of what I love about music.. so that's not good.Now, how would it be better, using similar concepts?Well, let the player build a song, from a set of rules. Perhaps the backing track already have its progression set, and the players have a larger pool of sounds and notes. Maybe the notes he has to place are already set, but the way they're played (instruments, sequences, effects, etc.) are to his liking. Maybe we could build an actual song that would be different from player to player, while obeying certain rules. Give the music space to breathe.With some more thought, I believe this could work. As it is... maybe it does for most people, but certainly not for me. And that's fine!Now, I've been negative enough.The presentation and functionality of the game is actually really good!The minimalist visual style works very well, it looks good and has a very novel, but solid way to presenting information in a pleasant way!The songs themselves weren't much to my liking, but they sounded pretty good (sonically), for the most part! There were a couple of rougher edges in the track not connecting perfectly, but it was nicely done, for the most part!It tries to change introduce a few mechanics, every once in a while, to keep things interesting.The way you can listen to any point of the original song at any point is good, and you can fast forward your own song to listen to the exact part you want.The interface is also fine, as I didn't have any problems with it at all.I truly dislike the *game* and how music is used. And it's the most important part, to me, which is why I don't recommend this.But the developers are clearly capable of a lot, as everything else is very well done!So yeah, I'll be negative for now, but I'll be on the look out for their other games, the talent might be there!"

Similar to LYNE, Splice, SpaceChem, KAMI, or Perfection., Circuits is polished to perfection, very easy on the eyes, and EXTREMELY easy on the ears. Circuits has one of the best soundtracks of any puzzle game ever, and for good reason: the gameplay revolves around the music. The object of the game is to construct certain songs piece by piece, by listening to the full thing in sequence, and then doing your best to remember what it sounded like. It gets more and more complex as you go, as it has very nice progression. It stays entertaining as it introduces new methods of completing increasingly difficult and complex songs, such as looping certain clips. My only complaint is the difficulty and length: it starts way too easy for the first 10 levels, and then hops up the difficulty quite a bit. But after that it has beautiful progression. It also only took me 85 minutes to complete, but since it's so enjoyable to listen to the music and such a pristine and refreshing experience, the shortness doesn't matter that much; I played through it one and a half more times before I got bored. Also since it only costs $4.99, it's a great deal even for an hour-and-a-half-long game! (especially if you get it on sale) Circuits is a little gem that went unnoticed by most.

This alone is tedious enough without an annoying message at the end of a long piece telling you ""You got it wrong"" in the most frustrating and flat way, and not giving any sort of incentive to be creative or want to keep at it, as there is only one correct solution. There's not so much a feeling of puzzle solving and reward as there is of doing the chore and continuing on to the next similar sounding 'chore' without any promise of something greater. Was hoping it would have expanded a bit more on musicality and intuitive solutions rather than having to sit listening to a whole track just to find out one thing is slightly off. The music is not very expansive at all either - what's there is good, but it really doesn't deviate from the 'chill electronic' theme. I was hoping for a lot more to be honest.

I've been playing this game for like 20 minutes but, guys, these things: This bro I know sees me playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥and he's like ""tell me how it is"" and I was all like ""this is more mechanically static than i thought it would be but that makes sense seeing as music is generally of duration and such"" so I cut it some slack yo, but I blurt out more nonsense like ""it feels kind of like mastermind but with music... but maybe the second track just feels arbitrarily placed for some reason."" You can move around samples and stuff and get a feel for different things (I liked on the fourth level where you had to pick one of two rhythms and one was more on beat while the other was somewhat staggered and it was neat to see how that affected the rest of the piece's pacing). Ultimately though you're restricted to the artistic act of music creation(???) because it is certainly reliant more on puzzle than on creativity, but it feels like it hits an odd spot in there, all up in the middle.Sorry, I'm afraid to hit enter. Don't worry about it! Worry about this: that the game can do that is cool. it gives an element of learning music, because there is definitely an inherent feel to experimentation, but also that you can see some cadences, and they feel natural, and you're like ""heck yeah guys. incomplete cadence? no way bruh"".The music seems to pretty much be in technological centered styles of music, and I guess - sure - it feels contemporary.Unfortunately I should probably point out that I make music? In my spare time? So it's like, I think a lot of people would find this chill and dare I fathom... *fun* and puzzling. But ultimately you're tied into what the music creator's framework is. You can experiment and just groove on it, and you can move around in the piece relatively quickly (though I would say interaction could feel less artificial, like, there's probably a better way to navigate than using a mouse on a linear scrollbar, and the two ""play"" mechanics feel awkward when they initiate similiar actions but within different contexts that aren't made readily apparent).I would totally recommend this to people between ""i play music occasionally"" and ""i like music and/or puzzle games that are relaxing"". To me - personally! - it feels sorta like ""i want to play something relaxing where I don't have to pay attention to creating but it feels like an awkwardly involved and unnecessarily restricted pantomime of musical sampling.""Though to that I end I give it a thumbs up because it let's me do all those things specifically, and it makes me want to jump on my own music setup, so birds?! Two of them?! am unsure of stone unit quantity but whatever babe that's just how i roll."

There are so many awesome samples being used, and I would LOVE to be able to remix and create my own songs using these components, but the feature is completely non-existent at this point.There are also a lot of minor song components that are not included in the puzzle, but are played out automatically as the song progresses.  It would be nice to see an ""Expert"" difficulty in the future that forces players to add in ALL components of the song (echos/intros/outros).Update: The developers are planning on releasing a ""remix"" mode in the near future that will allow us to create our own songs in the game."

It's not very long; I beat the whole game in around 3 hours (as you can see). For the most part, it's not that hard, either, unless you're trying to get the ""Golden Ear"" achievement (which requires you to complete every level without separating the song into individual layers). Speaking of achievements, I managed to get all but three in my first playthrough - and one of those three was an achievement for skipping 5 levels...That said, though this game might be short, it is surprisingly challenging in the final few levels; you can't separate the last two levels into layers, so it's all up to your ability to listen carefully and pick out the different layers yourself. Music lovers in particular will almost certainly enjoy this game. (...Though I was not a fan of some of the electronic/dubstep songs.)If it's on sale, I'd recommend checking it out. I just wish there were community-made levels or something so I could get more replay value out of it.EDIT: ...And now, 3 hours later, I've beaten the game again (...well, the first 23 out of 25 levels, at least) and gotten the ""Golden Ear"" achievement (the other two took about a minute or less each).

,Recommended,282760,16048675,"Posted: 28 May, 2015",all,RoflCopterPilotX,"Circuits is a small, sound-based puzzle game that focuses on a player's ability to discern different tones that form part of a piece. The player, in this game, has to use circular modules to correctly assemble the same piece, using certain modifiers as necessary. These modules assume different colors and sounds, and the soundscape is quite diverse, from auto-tuned vocals to elegant piano tidbits.As of 5/26/15, this game includes 25 reasonably challenging levels that can be made easier through the use of its limited-per-level hints system and its track separation features, but some of these easing mechanics are slowly taken away from the player as the levels get harder to fully challenge the player to discern even the most subtle of tones.Personally speaking, it takes a strong ear to distinguish certain harmonies in the later levels, where, at a certain point, track selection is revoked, and the player must build the piece holistically, partly by trial and error and partly by the understanding of the development of the piece as the music player progresses. The player is never penalized for taking too long; in fact, part of a feature to do a ""practice listen"" of the piece (or a track thereof) permits the player to rewind the track and move the music player needle manually.This calm atmosphere is further evident in the resulting pieces that are formed; one would indubitably not consider them intense pieces like dubstep or hardstyle tracks, but rather easy-listening and occasionally ""trippy."" As a result, the game is relaxing to play, and is a great change of pace to fast-paced multiplayer games like ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"" and ""League of Legends.""That said, I did not encounter many issues with the game, but as its loading screen says, this game is definitely best played with headphones, not only for optimal sound quality, but also for a better opportunity to pick up those subtle sounds that make that thirty-second piece fuller.This game would be considered ""short"" by those players who enjoy blazing through games, but it's a small package that's available for cheap, and so I'd call it good value (Full disclosure: I did purchase this while it was on sale). I played this small game over a period of time, and when I played it, I always felt a sense of tranquility associated with solving puzzles and enjoying listening to the bite-sized musical compositions the game had to offer.While a ""fit-the-objects""-style puzzle game is nothing new (jigsaw puzzles, the Web game ""Electric Box,"" ""Tetris""), this game is unique in its smooth execution of blending sound and ""fit-the-objects"" gameplay together.In conclusion, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who has an appreciation for music in general, anyone with an interest in somewhat unconventional puzzles, and everyone else who's somewhere between those two groups. It's a relaxing, lovely-sounding game that essentially commands the player to appreciate the sounds surrounding him/her and the minimalist, circuit schematic-style aesthetic that the game offers.(Tip: Unless you're stuck in the distant past, this game is not graphically intense at all {it's in 2D}. You are recommended to launch this game at your monitor's native resolution at the highest possible graphical setting.)P.S. While ""Circuits Composer,"" the track maker accompanying the game, is there for me to review, I have barely used the software to write a meaningful review."

The videos, images and reviews here, though, make it seem like a title with similar logic with Guitar Hero or Amplitude. It's a ""music game"" after all, how different can it be? A lot!The subtle but huge difference is that in all those titles you take on the role of the ""creator"" or, at least, ""fixer of broken"" music: the music doesn't exist until you do your stuff and, hey presto, there it appears - and you feel like the best DJ in the world. Or guitarist. Or something.Circuits is the polar oposite: they are ""action"" games, this is a puzzle game. Thus, the player is passive, and you don't ""create music"": you listen to a pre-existing song, again and again, and try to RE-create it by moving bits of it here and there.As I've already written, that doesn't mean that it's a bad game - it's actually a great one.

I hear violins and stuff in a lot of the levels, and I wish I could try and place those in places as well. Or a more difficult game completely.

I enjoyed the music and concept of the game.Now to list the problem me and a friend had.  It was the randoming of the node placements.  You see, every time you replay a level, the audio nodes at the bottom are randomly shuffled.  Because of this, you cannot make an actual solution guide to the game.  You have to basically listen to everything and begin a trial and error method of solving.  While this seems okay for the first few levels, in later levels, you deal with as many as 16+ nodes, and hearing the same 2-3 seconds gets grating.I spent nearly an hour trying to solve level 24 because too many of the audio nodes sound too much the same.  I eventually took my headphones off as I just couldn't stand it much more.  I feel that the game should automatically give you hints on what pieces are wrong and/or why its incorrect after you play back a song, as the limited hintings some of the levels give just don't help that greatly.My original rating of this game was 90% but I have to drop it down to 60% because I expected the game to be more relaxing, and not hair-pulling frustation.  While you do get the OST with the game, it is kinda difficult to fully recommend the game.  However, the price is pretty good.  If you have an hour to pass, this could fill the time."

I found it on sale for about a dollar and, for that much, it was well worth it. This puzzle game is designed around simple notes and music with the goal of recreating the music provided with the jumbled notes. It's quite simple early on but the game throws some nice twists at you to keep you on your toes. The later levels are quite a nice increase in difficulty and will test your abilities to differentiate the notes. If you like music or creating a simple musical piece, this game is definitely for you."

The game is a puzzle game where the player has to be able to listen to parts of a song and be able to distinguish the different parts of the song so that you can build the song.  Now that may not sound so hard, but later on you start getting parts that may have the slightest difference and there may be 4 or 5 of those.  This can get real tricky when you have to listen to the same five parts over and over just to figure out which one is right.  The player is given a row of circles, each circle plays a different track of the song and you have to build the song with the tracks you are given.  If you misplace a track,  when you go to play the song through, it will bring up a message at the end of the song saying wrong and it will have you try again.  There are 25 levels and each have a great song to go along with them.  If you have a keen eye for making music, you can try their very simple Circuits composer which allows you to take all the parts of the songs of the real game and make your own songs out of them.  Overall I really like the songs that you build in the game, most of them are techno and dubstep songs and there are a few piano and and modern orchestral style songs.  I really have no dislikes other than i think they should add more levels and make it so you can post and play your own creations.  I think this game is worth it to try, it is a different type of puzzle game instead of your typical matching, card, crossword, etc. style games."

Initially I didn't think this game would have any real replay value until I saw the Circuits Composer (which I have yet to try).  This game is well worth it's price, even its full price!UPDATE: I just tried the Circuits Composer, and I was mildly disappointed, as I can't create new levels/circuits — only songs.  Oh well....Two of my favorite things combine into one game: music and puzzle games.  Moreover, the devs have done it in such a special way that makes the music a serious part of the learning process.  This game, true to its word, gives valuable insight to the layering process that goes on in musical composition (and even some live performances), and quite frankly, has made me a little less shy about composing my own stuff.  It was perhaps a bit easier for me than most to solve the 25 puzzles in the game since I have a good sense of rhythm, count, and perfect pitch (try me!).  That said, while I recommend this game for anyone, I highly recommend it for anyone interested in or good at music.My main complaint with the game though is that at times it is a bit too simplistic.  When I think of ""circuits"" I think of lots of complex loops and switches.  In this game there are more nodes and dead ends than loops and switches.  But don't let that discourage you from enjoying and assembling the music.Also, if you have the game and haven't yet played through it, I challenge you to get the ""Golden Ear"" achievement on your first playthrough.

The creator went above and beyond my expectations, and the full game is one of my favorites in my lirbrary so far! The music in the game is amazing, the controls are easy to use and enjoyable, the graphics are simple, but they are also beautiful at the same time!Circuits is played by first listening a song or part of a song, then filling in parts with the short clips that are provided to you. You will fill in parts for beats, bass, piano, synths, and even some vocals parts. If you get stuck on a certain part, you can listen to individual layers (such as one layer for bass, one for synths, and one for vocals) so that you can hear each part in more detail. If you're still stuck, you can also use the hints to show what is wrong, or place one sphere in the correct spot. Once all parts are placed, you can play the song to listen to how your work has turned out!I would suggest buying this for anyone who is interested in listening to, teaching, or creating music. I enjoy learning and teaching vocal music, and have developed a good ear for hearing and learning parts from it. When I saw this game, I though that this game was perfect for me, because I already could pick out parts easily without switching layers, and continue to play to train my ear even just a bit more!

I feel that there aren't really any bad points to the game but rather areas that could have been improved on:1) The fastforwarding in listening mode and play mode could have been the same. Having two different ways to perform the same thing feels weird.2) More freedom in building the music. I love the idea behind the game, however, I wish it wasn't a memory matching setup.3) More variation of node icons. Seeing a - symbol outlined with yellow yet having different sounds can be awkward.
