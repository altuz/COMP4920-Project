The game was not completely abandoned by the dev team... They decided to slap some janky features like parrots that tumble thru the sky and dogs that run sideways up hills to the game. They also added some funky sound effects and downgraded the graphics it seems. Well done sirs! It is now officially FINISHED! Yay!Seriously, it's still not done and in this day and age no game should look like this. Are you kidding me? The dev team must have gotten bored and decided to just push out a release as-is.

So because he is either afraid of conflict, or an outright scammer, he contributes to the trouble legitimate independent developers are having with early access.Valve needs to hold enough of the early access funds in escrow to make it worthwhile for developers to finish their game rather than crapping out yet another set of promises stacked on top of a glorified set of legos and raking in the $$$."

I have brought a couple of early access games and with one or two have been very impressed - but then there are the people who don't complete thier games, cut, take the money and run, steam does need an escrow system and some minimum standards for what is considered complete.Personally I have been burnt twice now - if I get burnt again I will stop supporting early access full stop which is a shame because then the legit developers will suffer. Sit up and take notice Valve you need to do something to rescue early access or everyone will suffer.2/10 - Massively incomplete."

Now that it's ""released"", it will probably never become a really interesting game.First, it's glitchy.  Getting stuck on the landscape still happens.  If you step in a tiny hole, you might die, because the engine can't decide where you are, and beat you to death.  You can't just walk up and down the stairs in the prefab towers, because you are too tall, and the engine stops your motion if you get close to a block or vertical terrain.  This makes movement feel really difficult and pulls me out of the immersion.  It crashes too frequently, though not so much that it can't be played.  Rain still occurs indoors, and under terrain.Why build a house or anything if it's just going to rain inside anyway?  Seriously breaks the immersion for me.Second, why am I doing any of this?  There's no direction in this game.  Not even a survival motive like that really popular game with blocks.  The machines and technical progression are neat, but I just don't feel like there's a good reason to do anything.  There is a rare material that's only on the asteroids, but it was kind of a let down when I got some.  So, less reason to explore.Third, it's not even close to finished in any way.  I haven't played much since 4.0 came out, but there doesn't appear to be a working door.  So even if keeping wildlife out was a reason to build a structure, there isn't a way to do access control.  A short wall will stop any wildlife I encountered, except birds, but they are pretty harmless.  So why build more?  Just a pile of blocks will build the ""culture"" score, and then what?  Storage and containers seem like they are always disorganized, with no way to line them up.  The textures make it really  hard to see if you are looking at a flat wall of rock, or if there are holes and projections and the like.  If you build on a spherical planet, it's hard to get anything level on the terrain, because the curvature is pretty extreme.  I realize that's hard to get away from, but the machines in my cave-house were alway all♥♥♥♥♥♥eyed, because the floor can't be made level without bricking it all up.  It takes too long to build anything, too.  I'm bored of building before I even have walls.This game has tremendous potential that will now, sadly, never be realized.  The way the game is right now just isn't that much fun.Also, I hate the musical score, every single piece.  It's well done, someone put a lot of effort into it.  I just don't like it.  At all."

Based on a single player game.Well It's not exactly a scam Like Linden Labs pulled with Patterns, but this title has suddenly announced after a long time away that it has moved from Early Access to final release, and in my opinion it still feels like Early Access.But let's start with positives. Although I give a thumbs down, there is still gaming to be had here.Open world/galaxy generated worlds with crafting of simple objects with of course much mining for resources. Simple rewards screen to upgrade your skills and unlock objects with the objective of building a ship to get you off the rock your on and onto another rock.And the negative is centred around the word I keep using, ""simple"". It's why it still feels like a development version. Gameplay is very simplistic and unchallenging, features are a bit half baked and it feels like a demo. As a single player game it is over very quickly and your left wanting much much more which is a shame as the core concept is still exciting.As an Early Access review I would be giving this a thumbs up as good work in progress, but as V4 is the release version then I cannot recommend it.Maybe development will continue and my view will change."

Will the game grow to become another good game on steam? Will the devs carry it to the end? Or will it crash and burn? In this case, I lost the bet, which is surprisingly rare. This early access title was dumped into the 'finished' catagory in the middle of development (maybe a little earlier). It had no reason to be finished, everything is buggy, moreso than your average beta, lots of things unfinished, ect... And that really upsets me.

It sounds neat but aside from the planets feature, there is nothing worthwhile about this game. Crafting is boring, harvesting is worse, and the planets are tiny. If you want to wander around a game that looks like it was made in 1999, collecting x*hundred units of this and y*hundred units of that, this may appeal to you. Voxel games like minecraft tend to work because of a cohesive aesthetic but in this instance the developers removed the blocky feel to the world and replaced it with hideous textures and low poly count models, while leaving the world fairly smooth. Combine this with an utterly dull and lifeless universe and you have a flop in the making."

Without gravity, a spaceship is completely unflyable because you can't stay on the floor, which means that if you get into a spaceship without one and fly up, you'll lose control of it and not be able to land it.Because of this, my main game, which had been saved while in space, couldn't be played any longer. As soon as I loaded it, my character floated off the floor and couldn't take control of the ship. I lost a ton of progress. Also if you saved on an asteroid, you're similarly out of luck, because one jump sends you off into space.In the end, all this update did was add a requirement and break some people's saved games. Before this last 'patch', I could find some amusement in this game from time to time, but now it's completely unplayable. To the programmer: Did you even playtest this at all?On top of that, world generation takes a ridiculously long time even though the whole star system is smaller than a small fraction of other voxel based games that load lightning fast. Having too many planets makes the system impossible to play, though I'm not sure why that would make a difference since any competent code would only be loading the planet that you are currently on. It's pretty obvious that the programmer does not know what he's doing.Additionally, the game freezes for about 10 seconds seemingly at random about every 5-10 minutes.Also turrets are completely useless since if an enemy gets behind something of yours, including the house or ship that the turret is attached to, it will shoot right through it. I had a turret destroy my spaceship while trying to kill a snake on the surface of the planet beneath me."

You can go through the build-trees and as soon as you've built your space ship to go to another planet, it starts to get really boring. There isn't really anything other to do than to gather and with the limited building height, you can't really make a nice castle, like you can in Minecraft for instance. The most fun in Minecraft, which makes it still cool to play is the redstone. Once you've built all there is in Masterspace, you're basically done and you can uninstall the game.Another thing that really is bad, is the monster AI. Cows, sheep and pigs all seem to gather in lakes. They don't even drown. Also what's with the dogs/wolves. Even the baddies are merely running around like chickens without a head and are too easy to kill.By the end of the building tree you can create teleporters, but they are very buggy and often you end up in the middle of space. It would also have been nice that when you die on one planet, that you actually revive there as well, so your only space ship is not on a far away planet upon revival.So even though it is fun from the start, this game is far from a finished product."

,Recommended,282860,10026420,"Posted: 5 May, 2014",all,sgt bonkers,"Masterpace is already an excelent little game and hopefully the developers will see fit to carry it forward.While there are several modes, my favorite is the spherical planet with 3 other planets. You begin on a spherical planet, you can run round the enitre planet in 5-6 mins. As the sun goes round you can keep moving and stay in daylight all the time.Currently the basic drive is to get culture points which are then spent on perks. Perks unlock additional resources and equipment ultimatly allowing you to build a spaceship and fly away to the other planets.There is enough motivation here to make the game playable, and as Culture points are gained only by constructing buildings (which can be saved separatly and shared) it makes this more of an architectural/building game rather than a mining game. Thus the amount of game play you get is somewhat dependant on you liking building.The building tools are adequate, they could be improved, but are very usable already.There are a few hostile mobs on the planet, these are easily dispatched with the pickaxe and do not currently re-spawn, so you can continue building unhindered.Terain forming spherical planets creates some interesting effects, both mining and re-depositing material. Even manufatured materials like steel can be used to teraform.Be aware this is an alpha game so be prepaired to make a consierable amount of the fun up yourself."

I would say this game is very promising. work on the UI a bit and some of the annoying bugs and it'll be good! Note if you use Nvidia optimus you will have to manually set it to use the discrete graphics card(many steam games have this issue). This is a taxing game, especially on the ram as every planet is loaded into the memory. I have a 3rd gen i-5, 660m, and 8 gb's of ram and managed to max the base settings, however when starting a new game my ram limited the amount of spherical planets I could have. Still built 10 planar planets of ranging sizes and manage to maintain 35 fps.  The crafting is fairly simple and intuitive, and the default controls work pretty well. I have experienced a few freezes, one total lockup. overall though as long as you can deal with the occasional freeze(i've read people have lost saves), I'd recommend this game. One thing besides optimization I would recommend is to polish the UI!"

They seem like they are realitivly similar but this one is smaller scale from what ive seen so far.Id  recommened this game simply because of its style. Sandbox space games are a thing that will surly pop up a lot more.This one in particular has a bit of a rough start up if you dont choose the right perk at the start. For example, dont put your first five points into a plasma cannon. You wont get anywhere.This game is pretty fun with friends. A good time killer for solo play. The ship and building limits cause some interesting designs.This game has its strong points and weak points like any other. Id say some strong points would be voxle terriforming, multiplanets, a fair crafting/perk system that requires a bit of reading to use correctly, and the visuals arent half bad. Just not the best. Some weak points would be FLOATING TREES (dont mine them, it looks bad), really bare to the bones basic AI that can get a tad annoying when they get in your way randomly, weird gravity on spherical planets that has potential of causing headaches, and audio...

You start on a planet and work your way up to ships. There's a skill tree, several interrelated build lines, and all of that.The game is interesting, there's some workshop mods already out there, and it looks good graphically.Problem: BUGS. Showstopping CTD bugs. I don't mind supporting games in alpha, but this is ... well, I ran the tutorial and it kicked me off the planet into deep space with no way to get back. Stuck in the ground several times, random crashes.I recommend it but with caveats."

I mean there's some good ideas, but it's hard to -get- anywhere when you can't actually fight off the hostile creatures they throw at you until very lategame when you accquire a weapon. (After having spent nearly an hour dying, respawning, and dying again because of one damn snake, this is sort of a big issue.)Still I realise this is an alpha and there's going to be some serious work done, so I'm not TOO torqued out. It shows some impressive promise!"

You should try that before you buy it from Steam.This game should be clearly marked as beta or pre-release content. In that context I would not have felt cheated at paying for it.In fairness, you can see its potential but that is largely undeveloped as yet. The game lacks polish in many obvious ways, though it is pretty good in just as many others. That's about a 50:50 ratio of bad to good.It actually comes across as being a pre-concept of, or offshoot from, Space Engineers which is much more fully developed.Masterspace is not a game to spend money on unless you like to promote new developments like Green Lighted games.I'd rate it 6/10 for visisble potential, 3/10 for actual development and 1/10 for current value for money."

Yes, I do, but would I want other people to play it?... Not so much.First off, the loading times. Sure, that's to be expected in a game like this, but if you have one of the best systems on the gaming market and it takes you 45 minutes to load a game because you added a few extra asteroids, it gets kind of rediculous. If you're like me, and decided to watch Game Grumps while waiting for it to load and finally get in after lord knows how longs, only to discover that the game can't even handle it and you can't move at all, no matter how long you wait, once again, it gets kind of rediculous.There's no updates... Like, none. at.... all.... It had one update since I bought it 4-6 months ago, and since then it's been dead. Unfortunately, this is undoubtedly a dead game, unless they decide to pivk it up again. The idea is wonderful, SOOOOO much potential is just waiting there, to build upon the system they created. Yet they're too lazy to even considider the community. If you want this game anyways, feel free to grab it, but don't use the generator. Just use the presets, trust me, even when turning the preloading of resources off, it'll still take five hours to load up a world with two standard planets, five random planets, and eight asteroids...The verdict? About 2/5, that's all I can give it, and until it's proven otherwise by the creators, it's a dead game.EDIT:The developer has told us that he hasn't been able to update Masterspace because he's recovering from illness. Given the extensive timeframe, I can only assume it wasn't your average cold or flu. The point being, when this game begins getting updated again, I'll make sure to change the review. Good luck Masterspace developer, and I say this because it's one guy working on an entire game. Give him some love guys ^.^Edit 2:This guy has come back and successfully updated the game and made some dramatic changes. This game is now worth the play, and I recommend to people who are especially fond of Starmade. Seeing as there is only one person making this entire game, I have to put into prospect the difficulty of sating the hungry community. This game WILL be successful, but only if it is constantly updated and people are willing to give it a shot. This is to you, developer. Update this game often, and pay atention to what the community wants. If you do this, I gurantee you'll be even more successful than you are now. Good work buddy :)"

I did put all the graphics on the top setting though, because normally my PC can handle that kind of setting. I can dial them down a bit to see if that helps.There are some bugs too it seems like I walked through a doorway of a house to get in but then it wouldn't let me walk out- I kept getting stuck. I had to demolish the door partly to get out!Game will likely not proceed from this point much so it's a mixed bag."
