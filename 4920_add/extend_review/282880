That's correct; 2014!Back then it was $29.99, had TONS of placeholder options dimmed out/unavailable, and was always ""about to be added"".  Of course the devs locked the topic (on page 4 currently of the discussion board for this game, I'm confident it wont make it much past page 5 with how slow their forums move) and went on scamming the playerbase out of their money at a high price point.  When challenged, the player was always conveniently blamed for being at fault for being unreasonable/too demanding/impatient. Seriously, just go check out the locked forum post on page 4.The placeholders that existed back then promised to have loads of content.  If you weren't playing during the end of 2014, you probably aren't even aware as a player of the options that were supposed to be added as content during the development of the game, so you're not even witting to what hasn't been given to you.  Just by reading the other reviews, it's clear that they chose to ""correct"" the options that use to be dimmed out for future release by just simply removing them.  So now the game is $2.99 because the community is on to them and they want to pull a few more folks in with what really boils down to a mobile app game now.The irritation levels for the folks that pay $2.99 probably won't be as high for the folks that paid $29.99 or $14.99 when they realize the short lived period of this game, but I wanted to leave this review to show the character and bait & switch tactics that they chose to employ for folks that may not have been around over a year ago."

I picked this up with a coupon, but if you're interested, install Faerie Alchemy on your Android or iOS device for free.The core match 3 gameplay is good, and the planned features sound promising, with a storyline, multiple game modes, a pet system, and multiplayer.  Though the game has potential, the current state is what you would expect from a free mobile game.  The controls are touch oriented, and those features nonexistent.  There is only a single basic game mode along with a rudimentary inventory and crafting system."

When/If that happens, and it's worthwhile, I will be changing this review. But as for right now, it's absolutely not worth the price tag. There are free flash versions of games exactly like what's offered so far. Save yourself 30 bucks.(EDIT)The developer makes excuses on every negative review. ""I'm making this game only for people who like it."" That is NOT how you give customers what they want. Listen to what the people are telling you they are PAYING you to make this game. Don't just put out some abandoned piece of trash like this, and then tell everyone why it's their fault when they point out you released broken trash. The last time I contacted the developer I was told there would be ""weekly updates to fix these issues"". That was now over two months ago. Not an update since. This is an abandoned project, or worse, a cash grab-and-run scheme from the start. I can't tell which. Don't give FaeVerse a freaking dime. To support this kind of ""developer"" is to punish the gaming community at large."

After the horrible mismanagement not only in development, but also in the PR aspect I would Highly recommend NEVER dealing with this Developer for anything.While this game is fun, it is very much unfinished. Many of the promised feature are not there. There is hardly anything in the game right now. This would not be a big deal for me being that it is early access, however there has not been a update or any progress in months. The dev have either secretly abandoned the game, or have a very poor work effort. They constantly claim they want to wait to have something big or finished before they update the game, but in the amount of time its been since there has been a update there is no reason why a large portion of the game hasn’t been finished. So for now even with a 90% off coupon I would avoid this game. Even if the dev released an update at this point I probably would not change my opinion until its actually released with the content promised because at this point that will either be never or in 2050."

The developer has removed features from this game in order to market them as totally new games, and the game itself is full of vague ads for products that may or may not currently exist.A glance at the official website shows that the developer has a habit of charging absurd prices for unfinished games and misleading bundles.

The presentation is clean and feels nice and smooth in it's movement.I got a paid copy of this game because I liked the solitaire game from the same developper. But the dev mismanaged his public image, charged a massive price for this title, and eventually abandonned it early access and made it free to play.

I got it for 75% off during the sale, and I still feel like I paid too much. It's barely adequate for a match-three game -- not nearly as innovative (or even interesting) as he seems to believe. Oh, well. At least I didn't pay full price. I know it's early access and all, but even with more features, the core of the game will still be mediocre at best. The interface is weak, too -- working with your inventory is far more fiddly than it needed to be. And the inventory items themselves are a great example of brute-force game design with zero finesse. He clearly just invoked every possible interaction he could think of and made only the most minimal, ham-fisted effort to tie them in thematically. Overall, quite an amateurish attempt. Cannot recommend to anyone. Get Puzzle Quest instead. If you already have PQ, play it again -- even the 2nd or 3rd time around, it will still be more rewarding than this silly mess."

Several game modes are available and it appears the developers are still adding new ones.  The gameplay is enjoyable but my major gripe at this point in release is that there are no tooltips or tutorial available to tell you how to use the special blocks that appear, making their use complete guesswork that can make or break your game.  This is a frustrating but perhaps understandable omission at this point in development.  My minor gripe about the game is it's asking price of $30 which seems high for a game that competes with other casual puzzle titles that are sub $10.  The overlay is supported, as is a single steam achievement, making this game ideal for Perfect Game hunters and puzzle enthusiasts alike.  This is definitely a title to keep an eye on."

However, I am noticing that the game will respond very slowly and then kick me out back to the Steam store screen. Not sure what thats about but okay.  The crafting is neat enough but a brief explantion would be greatly appreciated.  That is to say, explain what each piece does. The music has a Far East/Middle Eastern flair to it that is easy on the ears and serves great for background noise.I realize this is early release, good quality takes time and some devs have other things to do but even a short "" hi everyone, this is where we stand today"" would be nice.

In retrospect, installing this game for free wouldn't be worth it.The gameplay itself is an okay matching tile drop thing. You get given blocks of two (or three in some game modes?) symbols, alchemical rune-y things, to drop from the top of the screen wherever you want. Whenever three or more of these matching... sigils?... touch one another, they combine to the next sigil up- the coins become leaves, the leaves become blue illuminati symbols, they become orange magma rhombuses, and so on, as you... alchemically combine these elements into more exotic forms, or something?The trouble with this is that, logistically speaking, every successful match of three removes two pieces from the board- and every move the player makes ADDS two pieces to the board. Therefore, the player has to make one match every turn to whittle down the board at all. Sure, you can technically match a larger group than three, or make some sort of chain/combo, but in practice, it's a losing battle. Every time you combine pieces, the new piece you created starts to appear in the blocks you get given to drop in. Because the board is only six spaces across, this quickly becomes unmanageable- after around the eighth rune shows up, your ability to progress further is almost entirely down to random chance. It's sort of like, well, 2048? Except in 2048, only the two lowest value pieces are added to the board at a time, whereas in this, wham, suddenly a 256 drops on you out of nowhere.Surrounding this core mechanic are several different game modes. Unfortunately, most of them are basically the same. The worst mode is ""Infinity Mode"", because it's just the vanilla game- every time you would lose, it erases the bottom two layers of the screen so you can carry on. There is no end goal and no way of losing, just a meaningless score counter that measures your persistence more than any actual aptitude for the game. ""Chaos Mode"" is better, because it gives you special pieces which can be used to erase parts of the board (why don't these turn up in Infinity Mode?) and actually has a way for you to lose. ""Puzzle Mode"" is infuriating, as solving the puzzles requires on foreknowledge you don't seem to be provided with on the first run, as well as suppressing the instincts you used for the other game modes, and understanding the seemingly random behaviour of, say, where the final piece ends up when you combine a flat row of four. Very few of the mechanics of the game are actually clearly explained to you anywhere. ""Abyss Mode"" is barely distinguishable from the other modes- apparently it's just a game where there's a pre-determined random selection of pieces available to you rather than an individually generated set. Whoopee.There are also somewhere between two and a dozen other game modes and options that are greyed out on the menu. Bear in mind that this game was released three years ago. Don't get your hopes up for them to be added to the game any time soon.Also important to note- the music. Each of the currently available, grindy modes, has a single background track- a twangy, mysterious forest sound with faint woodland drums and echoes. This is the most hellish part of the experience. Shortly after playing the game for the first time, I knew I would want to uninstall it- it just wasn't very fun, and my hard drive space is at a premium. So, naturally, I felt- ""Oh well! Guess I'll just farm the rest of the cards and have done with it!"" This was a mistake. The pennies of value in those trading cards are not worth the hours I have had to spend listening to that mysterious forest music as my computer refused to tab away from or minimise the running game. Faeverse Alchemy has one of the stingiest trading card drop rates of any game I've played.For the record, Faerie Solitaire, which is set in some sort of shared universe with this game (but since FvA plays completely differently and has literally no story or characters, I'm not sure why), is actually much better."
