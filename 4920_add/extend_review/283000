If you prefer real time, micro management, or first person shooter games, this one is not for you.I rate the game 9 / 10.There are numerous negative reviews about this game and before I purchased the game, I read every single review.  Personally, the negaitve reviews are just a big ole bunch of whining.  Here's why:1) The game will crash.   So what?   Save often or upgrade your PC. FYI autosave happens at the end of every turn.2) The navigation and unit commands are unusual.   So what?   Read the manual, its full of useful information.  Invest the time to learn how to play the game.3) The balance of play is unsatisfactory (i.e. USSR tank armies are too strong,  German forces are overwhelming).   So what?   Mod the game to your liking or figure out how to win.Here's why I LOVE THIS GAME.....1) It is a labratory of history.  What if Operation Sea Lion or Operation Felix were successful?  What if Germany developed an atomic weapon?  What if the Italians stayed out of Greece?  What if Spain entered the war?  What if the Warsaw uprising of 1944 held and the city reverted to Allied control in between the German and Red Armies? All of these contingencies can be played out in this game.2)  Great value for the price.  Steam just lowered the price too.3)  Takes me back to fond memories of other great grand strategic WWII wargames:  Third Reich (AH), Storm Accross Europe (C64) and High Commannd (IBM-DOS).  Anybody remember these?"
,Not Recommended,283000,18172459,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,Whiteswart,"In short, don't! There are too little content for its price. I can buy two Paradox games of much greater capabilities with the same amount of money. And I suggest you to look the other way, as well.Now, what is it all about? WW2 in Europe, of course. But the title is not quite right, though. From where I stand, the ""Strategic"" elements in this game are its weakest spot, and you know what is the strongest? Well, the strongest will be the interface. There are not much to do but to build units, send them to direct battles and... idling for more resources. There are a ""Diplomacy"" button in the hud, yes... but forget about it! It is useless because there are no chance you'll get Diplomacy Points until the point you don't need them already. I mean, there are really exist a possibility to play for no-big countries like Greece or Romania, or even Ireland! But there are not a chance you'll change the course of history by playing one of them.Game mechanic is quite simple, but that's not so good trait, as you can think (as I thought buying this lame piece of code). Every country has ""Resources"" and a counter how fast they restock. Those ""resources"" in fact a single digital, and it can only be improved by conquering other lands. And if you choose Ireland , well... grab some popcorn, the only button you'll ever need is ""End turn"". That's a bugger, really, as there are dozen f2p facebook games, where you can actually build up your power, improving digits of manpower, morale, etc... And I'm not talking about ""Hearts of Iron"" or even ""Civilization"". This ""Strategic War in Europe"" in fact is dumber than f2p facebook games!About changing the course of history there. Let's suppose you're playing for France, and destroyed Nazi for good, defeat Germany in the early 1941. Italy becomes the leader of Axis, you defeat them as well... but at this time, Bulgary joins the Axis and becomes the leader of Axis, after defeat of Italy! Bulgary! Yeah, Very Realistic game mechanic, which reacts properly on every change in alignment. My Back!I'm not done speaking about mechanics, sorry for my rudeness. So, you have ""resources"" digit, it will raise with time passing, while you still have some land on your side of border. With those resources you buying units (ground, air and naval), and you can also spend some to hurry the researchers. A vague relate to Paradox titles, those researches are ""infantry"", ""tanks"", ""air"", ""subs"", ""naval"" and ""nuclear"", with tiers from 0 to 5 (although nuke has only 0/1 tier). Now! You have some units from the start, you can build more, you can transport them via railroads or boats from one end of Europe to another... in theory. In fact, you'll probably not ever use railroads or embarkment, unless you'll choose USA or England (neither of them is recommended). Basically, you just get what you have, and march on enemy lines, with some common-knowledge maneuvers, like to cut Maginot line through Belgium, And even there, in the armies basic management, we have a big disadvantage. The map is SMALL! Forget about limitrophes like Estonia! Christ, the POLAND has only 2! cities there, Warsaw and Lvov! And there are an achievement, to defend Warsaw for 5 turns. How?! The Germany always start first, so by the time you get the wheel, there are only two white-and-red ground units, so that's impossible to hold even two! rounds for Poles, no matter what you'll do (unless you'll cheat it some weird way).Okay, let's summarize:+ easy to start with, mere interface, obvious goals+ the events in the game goes along with the history books, well, except in more primitive view. Much more primitive and one-way scripted, really.- the major strategy is always build some tanks and rush to enemies cities. No artillery, very basic usage of air forces, almost useless fleets... And forget about spies and diplomacy!- the only chance to get more resources is to capture some cities, and capturing them feels... no, it doesn't provide any feelings, you're just pointing square A (your tank) above square B (any city). Booring!- the game is weak as strategy, but the achievements... well, they're the worst thing that game have, if not minding the price. Like to build 1K submarines, or infantry units. While game prompts, that it will count that thousand of units along all sessions, in truth, you need to finish that in one session, or the counter will reset. And there are absolutely no chance to have enough resourses to build that many. And I'm not even speaking about nukes there... To be frank, there is no legit way to complete achievements. Some use SAM about that game, and I can't really blame them, even if I hate SAM myself.- and what finished me, is the backup the devs give to the complaints. Just look at the community hub about the game, read some discussions, to make your own impression.Mark 4.2/10 - ""lame"". I recommend you to stay with Hearts of Iron and Civilization titles, for way better experience. And if you are up to something different, find two KOEI games: ""Operation Europe: Path to Victory"" and ""PTO: Pacific theather of operation"". Despite the fact they were made more than 20 years ago, they a Way deeper as strategies (than this ""Strategic War in Europe"") and in terms of visuals, well, almost the same thing."
,Recommended,283000,10253639,"Posted: 27 May, 2014",all,nmargie21122,"A decent entry level strategy game. While not as deep as games such as Hearts of Iron, it offers a fair amount of depth. Things like research and diplomacy are in the game, but not so detailed or timed consumer that they take away from the game. If you are looking for something fun that can be played in a few sittings then consider Strategic war in Europe.Key points of the gameUnit types:The types of units include Infantry, Mechanized, Armor, Airborne, Fighters, tactical bombers, strategic Bombers, and a verity of Naval units. Land units (except Airborne which are corps) can be bought as either army or corps. Armies are bigger and thus cost more. Depending on the size and type of unit it will be ready for deployment in 1 - 3 turns.Research:Players can research, infantry, armor airplanes, navel, subs and nuclear bombs.  Nuclear bombs are only one level (you either have them or you don't) and once you do you gain a bomb every few turns which can be dropped by one of your strategic bombers.All the others  come in five levels (some countries start at higher levels than others) and each level needs 100 points to reach. Players spend production points to increase research effort in the area of their choice. Any area can have up to three investments (represented by light bulbs), the first one cost 200, but the price for future ones goes down as the research gets closer to the 100 mark. For example if you buy all three investments upfront it will cost you 600 (3 * 200); but if you buy the initial 200 and wait a few turns the next investment might only cost 170. I seen it go as low as 30 when it was 87 out of the 100 needed. Of course once 100 is reached that level is unlocked and all the light bulbs go out and the player must start investing againNukes work slightly differently, there is only one level that needs 800 point and the initial investment is 1000 production points.As new levels unlock better units can be bought at an increased price. For example if you ahve 4 levels of infantry unlocked you can buy them at any of those four levels.Mod support:While there is not allot of stuff in the workshop yet the game does allow for mods. Want to change something, simply ask the developers on the forums and they will point you in the right direction. They even explain to one user how to remove the turn limitScenarios:There are a great number of scenarios included; ranging from beginning of D-day (13 turns) to full campaign (70 turns). Other options start with Operation Barbarossa and even a what if, that has the Allies fighting the Russians after the fall of GermanyPlay as any country or countries:One thing I really like is the ability to play as multiple countries. Where most games let you only play one, here you can play as many as you like. This really helps in saturations like the invasion of Russia where in many games the players German troops get stuck behind the AI Italian or minor axis allies forces.  In fact if you want to play as all the axis, all the allies or as Russia there is even a quick start where you pick a faction and control all the nations in itDifficulty set by country:You can set the difficulty level for each country in the game. The different levels adjust how much income the nations receives. This allows you to boost or subtract from nations for some interesting what if. Say the Italian economy was more in line with the other nations, or America was not the economic powerhouse that it turned out to be.CONS:Like any game Strategic War in Europe does come with its faults. The two biggest are: Random crashes and achievements not opening up. In both cases the developers are on the forums discussing the issues and are actively working the solution"

76561198028077495,Recommended,283000,13260147,"Posted: 6 December, 2014",all,Obi Wan Wiki,"As a fan a WWII strategy games I decided to give SWiE a try. The game has several playable scenarios and you can play as any of the axis or allied countries (or multiple). Overall the game is fun and the ability to play different countries makes playing multiple games interesting. You can also choose to nerf or boost individual countries. The game also incorporates some of the historical treaties and invasions of WWII and prompts a player to follow history or go a different way. Playing a single scenario may take 5-10 hours.A strength of the game is the number of combinations of land, air, and sea units. Land units can be pne of three: infantry, mechanized, or armor. Air units include fighters, tactical bombers, and stategic bombers. Sea units include three types of the following: subs, cruisers, aircraft carriers, and battle ships. These different types coupled with indiviudal unit strengths, levels, experience, and the ability to assign a handful of historical commanders to some of the units creates a variety of attacking strengths.The negatives would be the AI, lack of Pacific Theater and network play. The AI is fair adept but after replaying it becomes easier and easier to counter upcoming moves. However, this AI is far superior to the AI in the Hasbro Axis and Allies game. The game would be greatly enhanced if the map were expanded to include the Japanese empire. By far the biggest downfall of the game is the ability to play against others online...you simply can't. The game has a play by email option which is almost laughable. I guess they figured nobody would be willing to find someone to play long enough to finish a scenario. Too bad the game makers didn't break down the scenarios into smaller chunks and add network games.If you are fan of the Axis and Allies board game and looking for a good strategy game, this is a good choice. I would rate it an 8 out of 10."

I read that this game was published in 2012.  It is hard to beleive.  It really plays like it was made in the late 90's.  The tutoral is so bad they actaually tell you that is you get lost and cannot proceed you need to restart the tutoral.  The tutoral is just a bunch of pop up windows that you need to read. I also had a problem with the Steam install.  I had to uninstall and re-install several times before it would actaully work.  I finally started playing my first game and it locked up several turns in.  I had to re-boot the PC.  That is when I lost interest.
,Recommended,283000,10558878,"Posted: 20 June, 2014",all,ownosourus,"Strategic War in Europe is a turn-based grand strategy game. It’s often compared to Time of Fury as being smaller—in terms of scale and the time allowed to complete the game. Instead of a monstrous 300 turns, like some scenarios in Time of Fury, it only takes 70 turns to play the entire struggle from 1939-1945. The map covers an area from Norway in the north, North Africa and the Middle East in the south, the Urals in the east, and the Coast of the US and Canada in the west. It's at grand strategy level, which means you're focused on the larger scope of the war rather than every individual battle.Okay, so how does it play? It's quite good, for a budget title. It isn't as overwhelming as Hearts of Iron can be; it’s very manageable in terms of micromanagement. However, there are some technical issues that need to be corrected. The game can be a bit buggy at times. I had some issues with the sound which led to the game running really sluggish. I liked how the developers tried to simplify things, and it wasn’t too much. By comparison, the turn times are much faster than Time of Fury. It's moddable as well—this will add more enjoyment to the game. It fits in that happy medium of a grand strategy game focused in World War 2 Europe—a medium that strategy gamers like. This is a game that can be finished in a few hours rather than days or weeks. It isn't deep, but it’s not too shallow either. Overall 7/10."
76561198022534000,Recommended,283000,10512478,"Posted: 18 June, 2014",all,Jim Dude,"This is a very strange game, it is somewhat difficult to compare it to many other previous games based on the World War II Europe genre.  For example, games like Panzer General, Making history, Axis and Allies or even Diplomacy to name a few.  In truth, the closest I could think of to matching this format of game would be the old Avalon Hill tabletop game by the name of Rise and fall of the Third Reich circa 1970s. Although naturally this version is simpler or perhaps even somewhat overly simplified, it is not without its more pleasant charms. For example; the combat system is far less clumsy as well as boasting a production system that is not only fun and innovative but also more than a little challenging.Before getting to that point however, it must be immediately noted that a patch will be required for anyone running Windows 7 or later. I found the necessary patch on Google, I admit it did take some patience and require no little amount of venting frustration but in the end I am more than pleased with the total game experience. The simple truth is, this is not a game for the arcade player or the typical armchair general.This game will require the player to command at least some knowledge of the second world war in Europe. The A.I.is not overwhelmingly challenging so much as it is historically based. When playing Germany for example, a typical player will most likely be tempted to over-run Poland as quickly as possible in order to focus more quickly on France. What sets this game apart however; is that the allies will not deal with German aggression simply militarily. In fact I have found a refreshing change with this game lies along the channels of diplomacy and containment. In truth the scope is limited only by the imagination and the options available are as broad as one's own individual planning. In short this may be the first wargame set in Europe in which I truly feel that neither side has a clear advantage.None of this is to say that this particular version is not without its faults or problems. If anything I see it as a ""concept game"". Innovations in this game may eventually find their way into future ideas.In conclusion I would recommend this game, if for no other reason, than the price is reasonable and as a ""beer and pretzels"" concept, it does succeed in delivering what it advertises, no more or less.With the Pacific theater version, ""Storm over the Pacific"" now available, I hope to eventually try that one as well for a full war experience.Hope I was helpful.Jim"

It's not meant to be anything like Hearts of Iron. I am still having fun with it. One of the important aspects is to make sure to upgrade your units.

A top notch and in depth boardgame style WW2 game; you can be any country from a very long list, or any combination of countries! My only complaint is that your game ends on the real world date every time, regardless of what was actually happening at that time during your campaign. It would be a hands down must buy if not for that, but being forced to stop 2 months before my invasion of Britain was going to start (I took Russia first) really was a kick in the pants."

Twice I have lost by 1942, on ""normal"" difficulty.I have many tech level 2 infantry armies by the time the Germans attack in the summer of 41, right on cue, but I am steamrolled by Panzer armies of 20+ strength. My best infantry armies have a strength of 8 at best. My two armored armies and three morotorized armies are similarly destroyed as if they were infantry corps. The strength of the german panzer units is just ridiculous.They did not appear to have an air force, but then neither did I besides the two starting fighters, as one fighter is priced the same as 4 infantry armies. I was able to knock out the Baltic states and Finland after the pact with Germany triggered, sustaining no losses and narrowing my front.It's not a matter of strategy or tactics. I have my defensive line dug in in the best defensive terrain available, behind rivers whenever possible. This is nothing new to anyone that has played this sort of game before. My armies are commanded by the best generals I have. I try to fall back before the onslaught, using defensive terrain. I have fresh reserves of infantry armies dug in around Leningrad, Moscow, and Stalingrad. It matters not. They are rolled up by the spring of 1942, as while the winter impacted the movement points of the German legions, it did nothing to diminish their strength. They were well supplied and equipped, without a hint of trouble in their lines of supply as I retreated across the Urals again.Look, the Germans should be kicking ♥♥♥ in 1941. I don't know if there are triggered events later on that lower the strength of their units as they get deeper in to Russia, but I'm not making it that far. The math just doesn't work when you've got a dozen 20 strength units that can wipe away your strength 7 units without taking losses.There is a nice skeleton of a casual strategy game here, but it needs more work before I could reccomend this to anyone.
