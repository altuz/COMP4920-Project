But Super Chibi Knight adds a whole new perspective on this, with much more of these awesome upgrades, mounts, quests, secret areas, and adorable voice acting from the developer's eight year old daughter. In addition to the awesome gameplay mechanic, different open-world areas, and an awesome element of ""go wherever you want, do anything you care"", Super Chibi Knight is a must-get."

This sequel is as good, if not better, than the original. The storyline was well thought out and engaging, and the gameplay was very good. All in all a great experience from start to finish. Am eagerly waiting to see if another Chibi Knight game will be made."

A good chunk of that was in two particular places that I thought were a bit more difficult than they should have been for where you are in the game.The area leading to the final boss was a pita but the boss himself I thought was a bit too easy.Other than that, it was a very well done and worth the money.Edit: There are two paths you can take and the 4.3 hours only included one of those (the mage path or whatever it is called)."

,Recommended,283080,13332816,"Posted: 12 December, 2014",all,PipPopPuddinPop,"Super Chibi Knight is a Zelda-like game which focuses on adventure, puzzles, and fighting baddies.The map isn't huge, but it's densely packed with enemies, levels, quest givers, bosses, and secret areas. The enemies are brightly colored, with a very distinct art style. Levels start out flat, but later levels add moving platforms, switches which need to be activated by spells, and even deadly spikes.The leveling system is very unique. There are three separate levels: Amor, Special, and Sword. You spend experience on each of these independently. Experience requirements will only increase for the skill you're leveling. This discourages min-maxxing, and makes it easier to level all of your skills without spending massive amounts of XP.Super Chibi Knight is not a tough-as-nails Super Meat Boy clone. It's easy enough for young players or players who are new to gaming to pick up the controller and jump right into the game. But it's also varied enough for older players to enjoy it as well.Before I started, I thought that this was just going to be a remake of the original, but the introduction of The Beastmasters adds a whole new level to the game. It's fun to run around as a tiny knight in armor. It's even more fun to ride atop a giant purple beast which breathes fire, a large bison which charges at enemies, or a chicken which can glide.At the time of writing, the game isn't done yet. It took me 3.5 hours to get to the end of the Alpha version, and I expect a lot more content to be added to the game over time. The developer is actively taking feedback and constantly adding things to the game. This is one of the few ""Early Access"" games which I actually expect to be finished.If you're still on the fence about this game, check out the original Chibi Knight which was created by the same developer. Many of the game mechanics are the same, but Super Chibi Knight feels a lot more polished and varied than its predecessor, and we haven't even seen its final version.Original Chibi Knight:http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/526470"

Honestly, i have no words to describe how much you should really play this game. It is just so good and it'll hook you until the end. And even then, i might challenge myself and go for some of those achievements! The difficulty curve to this game i think is somewhat a little sudden but even then it's simply because the bosses play the same as bosses in 2d games. Each one has a pattern, some are hard to see, some are obvious, and some of the patterns require you to have very good precise timing. You might have a couple of rage moments but it personally made me all the more want to beat the challenge. A couple of bosses i even threw my arms in the air in triumph.Now...for my 2 nitpicks. The final boss felt a little....er, underwhelming to me? Especially if you have completely several side quests. I wasn't expecting most of the fight to be out on the map. And even then, once you go to the second phase it doesn't feel as challenging than some of the more complex bosses like the Salt guardian, the ivan dragon, or even the panda witch. Maybe some others found it more difficult, whos to say? Thats just what i felt about it and i felt a little disappointed about it.This is just a small one but on mahou island where you go to that area to aquire the double jump, what is the point of that small little room that is underwater? Is there a secret? Because i felt a little annoyed to see nothing there other than some blocks you can destroy which don't give you anything. I get very ticked a little when i see a developer design an area with no purpose unless it's an easter egg. Could be something you forgot. Who knows!Music was good in some areas however it didn't click for me a couple of times. I know alot of people loved it which whos the judge? When it comes to music it's all about tastes.Ok blegh blegh enough negativity. I had such a great time with this game and it makes me wish for more! I love some of the mini referances you had and pleaaaase for the love of everything, HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER VOICE MORE. I find that so cute and creative that you had her do all the voice acting. I bet she had a great time recording too.Anyway, i made this too long because i just had to express my love for this. keep making games bro!"

The graphics have a bit of a cheap look to them, but it works really well for the overall feel of the game world. I think it's great the developer made this with his daughter doing the voice acting, but also ensured that the game was quality, too! The character leveling up and progression is a nice touch and well-paced, with an accompanying visual flair for the player. I also like that after completing the second area, there seem to be branching options that will affect the gameplay, also; perhaps affecting replayability.Overall, $2.50 well spent.

Also, despite the cutesy art style, combat is pretty rough, with the unarmored chibi knight going down in 2 or 3 hits, and even with max armor, late game enemies can still take you out fast.It's not a terribly long game, and I beat the game twice in about four and a half hours total, completing almost all of the side quests, but not hunting down every secret. I didn't see a new game+ mode, so you have to start from scratch to play the other option in chapter 2, but that's not too bad.The best thing, though, is probably the voice acting by the 8-year old daughter.

More importantly though it's an homage to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link from the NES days of yore...I think Zelda II is highly under rated and one of the most challenging and fun Zelda games in the franchise... I'd even go as far to say as I enjoy playing it more than Ocarina of Time just because of it's simplicity but for some reason Super Chibi Knight just misses the mark in a lot of ways.The art style isn't my cup of tea, it's a bit sloppy and childish looking but I guess that's the theme, I just wanted to try it for the RPG / Action elements but the problem with that is, the game mechanics are really bad. Hit boxes are very sensitive in this game and your characters reach animation is abysmal. You literally have to be micro pixels away from enemies in order to damage them. The sensitive hit boxes is a huge issue right from the beginning, but with some over leveling you can persevere and get through the first chapter. This however becomes a huge issue later in the game, even after you're maxed out, the enemies can kill you in only 4 or 5 hits and their range is far superior to yours.There are two paths through the game, Beastmaster and Sorcerer... but it's more like sword spell... The Beastmaster side of things reminds me more of Adventure Island II and is the easier path to take through the game. The Sorcerer side (Sword Spell) is much more reminiscent of Zelda II... which is funny because that path takes place on an Island... go figure.A word of warning, there are many missable achievements in this game, a lot of which are convoluted and cryptic and there are two points of no return which you are warned about before you proceed. If you don't happen to get things done in a specific chapter, then you'll have to start a new game from the beginning and try again. From what I can remember, Zelda II allowed you to backtrack to every area in the game so if you happened to over look something, you could always go back... this game doesn't allow for this... it's just lazy and sloppy game design in my books.I bought it for 2 bucks and some change, so I'd say, yeah go for it... but for an 11 dollar price tag, it's not really worth the price. There IS a lot of replay value here if you can stomach the grind, but to beat the game skipping certain spells / abilities and not losing a single life is a bit too much in my books... It will call for heavy levels of aspergers and OCD... as well as not having a life... as the achievement states.I appreciate the effort to re-create the magic that was Zelda II but Zelda II, it's not... 5 / 10. Needs a lot of fine tuning for the battle mechanics if it's going to stand up to a game as legendary and tight as Zelda."

So of course, when this came out, I picked it up and gave it a play. The first chapter of the game is solid and fun and harkens back to the flash game, although the pit was a tad difficult, but only due to playing with a controller, but I'll get to that later. Once I unlocked the second chapter, which it turns out was before I finished the first chapter, I found myself locked out from the first chapter. I had a mission that I had not completed from the first chapter, and when I finally unlocked a way to go back from the second chapter, which again was before I was completely finished with that chapter, I headed back to chapter one. Upon my return, the entire first chapter was changed, and I was forced into a boss battle I was not prepared for. After many deaths, I finally beat the boss and was pushed forward into the volcano area, only to feel underpowered and easily killed. Did you know its possible to get there with naught but a sword, armor, the lightning spell and the fire sword spell? I found that out the hard way. Of course, my second playthrough will go differently, and I will play through it again, leaving my current character to die there. I cannot progress. My armor and sword are maxed out, and I just keep dying.Part of the constant deaths seems to be the fact that the game is absolutely terrible to control on a controller, even though it allows support for controllers. Double-tapping a direction on the keyboard is easy and fast, but its diffcult on a controller, and dashing is required in many points of the end of the game.This game has a lot of flaws, and believe me I understand the love for it. But my god is it frustrating to play if you don't do things perfectly correctly."

,Recommended,283080,16936485,"Posted: 7 July, 2015",all,arbor day,"This game is made by a father and his eight year old daughter. I recommend it on that alone.It feels very much like Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and I don't care what nonsense you've been told about that game, because this is a good thing.There are enemies on the overworld map that cause fights when you bump into them, just like Zelda II.You gain experience when smashing said enemies in their stupid cute faces, just like Zelda II.You then use the experience to increase Attack, Defense, or Special, JUST LIKE ZELDA II.A lot of enemies may look different, but mirror attack patterns and behavior of enemies in Crystalis.Wait, I mean Zelda II.What I'm trying to say here is that if you enjoyed Zelda II (and you do if you aren't a huge idiot) then you will enjoy Super Chibi Knight. It's worth noting that this game is faster paced than Zelda II, and has more quests / charm / voice acting / daughters involved in the development.Still on the fence? Go google the original Chibi Knight, which is a free flash game, and try that out first. Or, you know, go play Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It's really good, I promise. Don't listen to the people who talk bad about it; they are just bad at video games.Is it perfect? Not at all.It seems to run rather poorly in full screen, and could probably be optimized a bit better in that regard.The art is well done, but you can see some lines in the walls that give away the tiles.You can get stuck in situations that end with you taking unavoidable hits sometimes. Panda Witch boss, I'm looking at you.Using double tap to dash is really awkward while trying to do this in mid-air, because you have no forward momentum to your jumps. What I mean is, when you let go of the direction you are moving to initiate the double tap, you end up falling short a lot of the time because you had to stop moving to do the dash. You can also dash with the trigger buttons, but you won't know this unless you experiment on your own or go looking in the keybinds....Sometimes it feels like maybe they copied *too* much from Zelda II.Still, this is a fun game. It's worth ten dollars, especially if you plan to play through it more than once (there is a choice moment that might make you want to go back through a second time). You also get to support some really neat people with your purchase, and feel all fuzzy about that."

I usually love hack and slash games with RPG elements - add cute graphics and a cool developer team of a father and daughter. What could go wrong? A lot apparently.Positive:- Simple controls- Nice visuals- Different storylines depending on a choice you makeNegative:- Frame-rate drops- Music is not particularly interesting- It is not always clear what you have to do, making it somewhat frustrating to play- Enemies sometimes behave in a strange way, making it awkward, difficult and sometimes impossible to hit them- Very strange difficulty curve (final boss is arguably the easiest boss)- Taming beasts is very over powered- Some jumps are very precise to the point that it's annoying- Health and mana is not well thought out - it can be very difficult to recover HP or MP, so it's often easier to just die- No real punishment for death (besides going back to check point). Easily exploitable for HP/MP- Easy to dash by accident - causing you to fall into instant death spikes- Block is quite useless after the early game- Extremely poor game design for one segment: literally could not proceed because my ""special"" level was too low. I did not have the mana pool to continue and since MP does not regenerate in this game, I had to back track and grind to increase my special level.- No new game plus. Basically your save becomes useless once you beat the game as it will spawn you at the final boss.Conclusion:I did enjoy the first 30 minutes of the game but it was mostly downhill after chapter 1. It's a real shame that I feel frustrated after playing it. I bought this game heavily discounted but I still regret getting it."

I killed a boss so fast that the health bar was depleted and I had to reset the room and fight the boss over again - which was a little annoying.The other only issue is that the achievments are really broken. I did one of the 2 paths you can take in the game (which is why replayability is a must). There's achievments you'd have to get considering you can't complete the area without doing them, but they didn't unlock.Super Chibi Knight is your typical armor games, newgrounds, kongregate flash game, just upgraded to a full scale game on steam. It can probably be beaten in an hour if you're quick, good, and speed running. Otherwisde it's a 2-3 hour run per playthrough. Considering it has 2 paths you can take for the story, and it's replayability you're paying $9.99 for about 6-8 hours of gameplay. There's some secrets you could probably look up, but they're decently hidden and it requires at least 2 playthroughs to get all the achievments... More if they never fix the achievment bug. And I mean in-game stats, not even steam achievments.It's a decent game. It doesn't tell you exactly where to go or what to do. A lot of people may find this frustrating, but inbstead of just screaming ""what do I do now"" or looking up the solution, give it a think or explore. It's basically just linear puzzle solving, and  very minimal backtracking. If you're stuck, its a problem on your end (unless of course the game soft locks and you cant beat a boss without resetting).I'd personally give it an 8/10 on some reduntant scaling system. With my short attention span one playthrough was enough, so if it's not worth the price to me, its simply because I didn't play the game twice, or go out of myway to find everything. And the achievment bugs relating to a story I completed is just infuriating, knowing I won't be going back to complete it. Whatever system triggers the achievments is clearly broken by the same mechanic that prevented me from killing a boss with no health bar. Again, this is very minor and just a personal dissatisfaction. Your results may vary, and it may be you even have a much happier experience!I enjoyed my time, you probably will too."

This was also posted without being able to get mounts, which likely would have assisted in the game, but the reason for this is explained further down.As someone who has played the first Chibi Knight multiple times through, this game was a disappointment in quite a few aspects. The issue for the game is in its game play along with some other technical issues.It frequently crashed along with a variety of glitches that would interfere with game play. I would constantly encounter a glitch in which holding the down arrow to block would also move the camera down a good bit, and it would never return to its original position unless I died, or relaunched the game. Enemies would also glitch into floors and other objects making them unreachable, locking me into the area forcing me to relaunch if I were unable to leave the room and come back, even then sometimes the enemy would still be stuck. I've spent at least an hour just messing around seeing if I could fix the game and relaunching.Battle mechanics felt clunky the whole game. Controls were unresponsive in dire situations and enemy attacks were absolutely infuriating. A great example of this would be the ""Panda Witch"" fight. This fight would start off with the Panda in the battle roaring, blasting you a good distance. The Panda would then roll at the player, and with experimentation, considering the game provides almost no guidance what so ever, the player would find out that they were to hit the Panda, causing it to bounce around the room. The witch, flying near the roof of the room, would be hit by this Panda EVENTUALLY (spending 2 minutes dashing under a panda with broken hit boxes is not fun at all). After the panda would hit the Witch out of the air, the Witch would fall to the ground, becoming helpless for a certain amount of time, letting the player wail on the Witch for damage. The Witch would recover and fly back into the air after the player deals a certain amount damage. The Panda would repeat its action, but the Witch would start blasting green orbs that home into the player that dissipate when they hit you, or after a few seconds. These move at a decent speed that the player could dodge with enough focus and skill. However, the problem with this phase is that the Witch would shoot out multiple orbs in quick succession, after the first orb is fire, about a second or less later the second one would be fired, making it almost impossible to dodge them. It is extremely difficult to jump over the first without getting hit, or sliding under it. The ""easiest"" way to dodge them is to run to the other side of the room before, or while she fires the first orb. However, you would then half to likely deal with the panda bouncing around the room, the chance to dodge this is highly unlikely. This has the possibility to have the Panda not hitting the witch out of the air once more. If the Panda cannot hit the Witch within a few bounces, the bubbles are likely to hit you, or the Panda will. This fight also has a third phase just like the second. This fight can most likely go on as long as it wants. Oh yea, blocking is completely useless in this fight. Almost like every other boss fight.The last boss fight had a clever aspect to it. The more people you helped throughout the game would assist you in damaging the final boss, knocking its three health bars down. However, lets say that you helped the least amount of people possible, you'd be forced to have a tedious boss fight of swinging a shovel around at tentacles/giant eye, the target was unclear. Although its generally in your best interest to help others. I on the other hand, moved to the next island before being able to ""Free the Phoenix,"" collect some bugs for a poor soul, and never got the chance to ride a mob that was a huge new intro to the game. You are UNABLE to go back to the island until you complete everything you need to do on the second island, and when you come back to the original island, you are UNABLE to complete those quests and experience a large aspect of the game.I had way too many peeves and bad experiences in this game.Bosses took experimentation, thus you would have to die multiple times,Bugs and glitches along with crashing often,The blocking mechanic which wasn't needed often,The lack of guidance that caused A LOT of random roaming around for a good 10+ minutes that was uneventful,The extremely annoying boss fights that were tedious and not fun at all, I spent over 30 minutes on the ""Panda Witch"" boss fight described above,The constant backtracking to healing and mana regeneration points,The inability to backtrack certain aspects,Some enemies are just plain annoying to fight, along with some levels that seem to be made to annoy the player (looking over at the ice castle that freezes you if you don't move)Situations that are plain stupid, such as the hole in the beginning of the game, if you get hit by a slime ball, you get stuck and try to force your way unstuck, next thing you know you get hit by ANOTHER and ANOTHER, I think you know where this is going,Platforming was an absolute pain the the♥♥♥♥♥ especially when you include platforming with water, considering that if you stay in water for more than 2 seconds you instantly die.Over all, I did not have a very enjoyable time at all."

(but did i really have to?)later I'm outside and I kill some giant wasps in few seconds and apparently that was supposed to be hard.i kill some more guys and end up with some 3 orb things and i go to some well and find some random floating thing and he says something like ""hey dude thanks for the orbs kbye"" and he flys away and gives me a giant bag and i think that im TOTALLY gonna use the xp cause the enemies are so easy in this gamethen i go into a desert and kill some sand worm thingthen i kill guys in a forest and put some guys lamp bright again.then i eventually go to a desert and find some super slash thingy that you can use to fire a beam thing that would be TOTALLY usefulthen i go in a pit and do some thing with a lever by using the beam to reach ita door opens and i go through it and about 30 seconds later im fighting a bossi kill it with rocksthen i get a kid and i bring him home and realise i was only just doing a questi go in the desert again and then go through a red cavethen i kill some yellow orc and get his blood, god i wasn't expecting thati get a keycard and go in some spacship and a snake puts the key card inthen eventually after the same annoying as hell enemies i get to some room filled with stuff in jarsi break a jar cause i hate everything in this worldthen a flying wombat comes out and craps every wherethe same thing happens with the orc, i kill it and it turns into jelly and i take its bloodthen i get some dust on my sword and help some drunk guy with the bloodi use the dust to cut down some rocks and go into a templei kill everything and i also kill a guardian at some point and free birds and kill them 5 seconds later and be a horrible person and take their eggsthen i go past a door and a huge eagle takes me to some edgy island with dragonseventually i go and fight a thing and i get a chickenthen i fight another thing and i get something else but i think it was the buffalo thingi talk to some cool kids and they give me some edgy rhinothen i have to get medicine and its really boring and this person isn't even sickthey are instantly better when they drink out of the dirty bucket which makes no sense and i go through some rocks on my edgy rhino and i find some purple dragon and i free it and explode it with my beam and ride it awaythen i get some fruit to put in a medicinei have to go on my most epic quest in the whole game just to get a carrot, some water, salt, a bucket and some sacred fruit that grows probably every century/millenium but they don't care, they're daughter has a cold and you have to help them. it would not be nice medicine and i think it would actually make you more sick due because you mixed SO many things together and its just, ewthen they have the medicine and are instantly betteri find a vault and look up the code to get in and i find the code online and type it ini get a crap ton of xpthen i get some jump skill thingsome time soon i break a door with my dragon and my hometown is destroyedyay i love this sight everybody is DEAD (or they are probably hiding in the pit)hiding from the FAT BIRDS!the bird somehow came back to live and are edgy as hellthe only hard enemies in the game i am facing right nowi rk them and go in the final arealater i fly over a bridgei get to my final boss and all the guys aren't dead and they came cuz i did they're quests and they rk the boss's healthi eventually get on the point and its really freaking boring because they only have 5 attacks and spam them in the same order over and over until eventually i kill itwhen i thought it was over i had to go in his mouthi eventually fight his heartwow that was easythen i get vomited out of himthe endthis game is awful, it has no replayability or purpose whatsoever and it lacks difficulty and it REALLY is not worth spending about $10 on itwait what when did i have 13.6 hrs? i never even play this!"

I played it on my other computer with a 1080 x 1024 monitor and it worked great.Edit: I should have mentioned that the stutter bug is caused by an incompatible usb device. By graphical issues I meant that it looked a bit fuzzy on my 1920x1080 monitor but not enough to cause severe discomfort."
