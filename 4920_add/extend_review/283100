They do not mention the cash shop available on their website, with a limited selection of items to 'help' along players and there are more options for different packs to invest in the game (Ala Kickstarter type stuff.)Edit 2 - The game is clearly also 'Pay to win' right now. The more money you invest into the game is going to net you better gear, which makes it easier for you to hunt mobs and make PvP a simple matter of holding your gun straight at an enemy and holding the mouse button for a split second until they crumple under your overwhelming DPS. To give a comparison, the starting gun has a stated 16 DPS - The gun you can buy in a bundle has 300+dps, and you have a meager starting 50hp. None of the armor seems to reduce damage by any tangible amount either.To make it even worse, safe areas are not clearly designated or noted, and so you don't even know if you're even capable of defending yourself or being annihilated until you trade shots, and then you just sit there daring the other person to leave whatever safe area you've found so you, or they, can shoot each other in the back.Edit 3 - Game seems pretty stable if lacking in graphical options. Zero ability to adjust any graphical options at all and I couldn't find any to adjust in the files. Everything you build can be destroyed while you are offline, including the stuff you've bought in the bundles, and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it. If you lose your ILU (Basically your transport unit until they add more stuff for it) while you are offline and log back in, you are effectively stuck on the planet until you suicide into bugs. Hopefully you killed a bunch of stuff with that bundle you bought (You bought it, right? Hope you like doing zero damage and getting ganked all day if you didn't) because if you didn't, you'll be starting over from nearly ground zero. Re-grind for money to get another ILU to transport yourself to another planet only for it to be destroyed the next time you log off.ANYTHING YOU BUILD CAN BE DESTROYED WHILE YOU ARE OFFLINE. It is INCREDIBLY easy to do this. This wouldn't be such a huge issue if you weren't transported to another planet and dropped next to two to three other players ILU's, of which you can shoot if you want. You can also damage your own if you shoot it. The basic turrets provided to all ILU's only fire at mobs and not players regardless if you're being fired at or not.Edit 4 5/3/14 - PvP protection has been enabled on the first planet for all players. It's an entirely Co-op experience until you get your first ILU and get off planet and into another. No more camping complete newbies. Safe areas are labeled with a (SAFE AREA) in safe areas, but you still don't know when you're near one (The only safe area I know of now is the entire first planet.) Game is significantly more playable now because of the change.**I will continue to update this review as the game fixes it's initial problems. I'm in for the long haul in this one.**"

Seriously, I really like it... but:I built my first base. I spent a couple of hours to build. I built turrets, power-generator, item-storage, etc..After some time, came another player. He killed me with ""one shot"" and destroyed ALL of my base in less than a minute! My turrets (4 of them) is not fired even one time!This is the most stupid thing I've ever seen. This game is a huge waste of time and money.Worst thing I discovered after buying the game: This game has a shop! Where you can buy weapons, armor, etc. .. You have to pay for a game that should be F2P and has a system: Pay for Win!On the other hand: If you spend huge (real) money, someone come and destroy everything you have built in 5 minutes without a problem.I love PVP, but the game which have open PVP + shop with guns, armours, resources, etc.. is a BIG fail!My good advice: do not buy this game! Never!"

Just saying.IMO anytime a developer gives power to a player it's a bad thing, especially over others idea's and opinion's no matter how negative or positive they might be. tsktskThis game is a total lost cause in my book. To bad I had to be the fool to spend the 50 dollars in support of the game only to be ran off by power wielding developer's pet's, not just in game but in the steam hub as well.Let this be a warning to all those who think they are gonna play this game the way they want to or have their own idea's.They will♥♥♥♥♥♥all over you.Edit: Just an FYI, now they are even telling people to ignore the reviews and negative feedback, which they so rightfully earned for themselves by abusing the very people who were trying to support this game.I wonder if they will stop treating people the way they are or if it will continue? Think I'll keep an eye on this one just out of curiosity. I certainly won't be playing it anymore even if they do have my 50 dollars. Not worth the abuse from the Mod appointed by the dev's to be honest. At least I can say that without flinching.I feel really bad for the people who are stuck with the game and the lost money who can't say that it's no big deal they got screwed over. Best of luck to all of you though."
,Not Recommended,283100,9998649,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,Simon Drake,"At this point in time there are really only two features in the game. Base building and loot grinding to buy better weapons. Until crafting and skills come into play you will tire of the game quickly.Pros:-Base building is solid and you can edit structure per tile leading to high creativity. Costly and slow to do if you are not a bought in premium player.-Combat is fun and they got the tactical elements right. Hiding behind cover, flanking and leading your targets are all relevant to comabt.Cons:-Content is minimal. Shoot a few monsters a thousand times, sell monster parts, buy new gear. Repeat. This is IT to the game beyond building bases.-Lack of progression system, skills or crafting contributes to the extremely repeditive play.-Minimal anti greifing systems compounds the minimal content causing players to get bored and muder people.-UI needs work. Badly. Across the board.-Base security is minimal and most tiles can be destroyed/griefed without specific sheilding.Summary:Unless you want to support the developers do not buy this game yet as it is extremely early access and likely wont keep your interest for more than a few hours. I do however recommend following this game to see if it does get beyond its current itteration as the potential for something special is clearly there."

Apart from shooting bugs and following an extremely arduous mission line, the game has only one other feature - construction. However, as appealing as this may sound, a considerable amount of time (or money) will have to be spent in order to even think about construction. Aside from this, there's the annoying ganking and grade-A molesters who like to kill you at every opportunity they can get (as PvP isn't optional). Although I myself don't have a problem with that, I can imagine if someone went on a spree to kill a load of noobs the noobs would think it's an awful game and quit, straight up. The only way to earn money (it would seem) is to kill bugs, sell their carcasses and keep grinding on and on and on and on... My main ""bug"" (get it) with this therefore is just the lack of features. I've heard rumour that they will add these in as time goes on but at the moment, in alpha (or whatever stage it is in), I would say the game is worth about £2.99."

I see a lot of people complaining about pay 2 win. Yes this is a problem in games, but in this game it’s frustrating on all sides. As someone with more money than time I bought the high end Citizen pack. On the first day I built my base, put up my generators and put power in them and used shield walls, I was good to go. Nice and secure base. The generators only last 5 days. This is a huge problem, I did this on a Saturday that means if I don’t get to it on time on a Wednesday in time the power goes out, walls become vulnerable and that’s that.Well last Wednesday I was stuck at work and couldn’t make it home on time to login. Power went out, my base was raided, and I lost everything. $50 worth of stuff gone, just like that. Sure I still have my armor, but it’s almost gone too because of the degrading repairs. I basically paid for nothing.As a whole I wouldn't have a problem with this, I could have had someone do it for me, but then I’d have to trust them, or I could have topped-up the night before. Or whatever. Here is the problem. The game isn't done, tons of features are missing, turrets don't defend your base from players, and there is nothing to do but grind and raid bases. I understand it’s in development, I know what that’s like. But the fact that there is no wipe and reset for a live launch, no do overs in the game, even though the developer has no problems flat out taking away your currency whenever they feel the economy is suffering. This is horrible.Because of this, I will not be returning to this game. There is little reason for these kinds of decisions and there are many other things I can be doing with my time, more experiences that are better thought out.I wish you well with your future progress and player base, however I don’t think this game will ever have a substantial player base.Again these are my personal thoughts an opinions and I feel like sharing them."

It's early access, which means you play it and help the developer(s) decide what the right direction is for the game in the future.Going back to what I said about it not being good: well it isn't, but it isn't supposed to be... yet. The whole point is to play it yourself and tell them how to make it good. You have to join the process and contribute. If you aren't helping make it good, then you are keeping it from becoming great.This game will be great, I have almost no doubt in my mind.We just need to make sure that we are nuturing it into greatness.Yes, this game is flawed, but it is a child.

Their main forums at :http://www.colonies-online.com/en/forumsdo NOT seem too active. At least there is some help there.Right now the game is 90% grinding bugs , 10% PVP  . The only  sense of "" progression"" that you'll get is from  adding very very minimal upgrades to a base ( the amount of $$ needed if your not going the PTW route is enormous )  or selling the same 2 items to vendors  while killing the 5 different types of bugs over and over and over again.....There are no ' levels"" in the game, or a skill tree or anything of that sorts  .

I don't get the people who expect a finished game when they buy early access items.That being said, i think colonies online has a lot of potential. I bought the game pretty soon after the steam release, half a year ago. There has been ongoing development ever since - which is an important aspect to an early access game.What can you do now: Fight monsters and other players, grind money, buy better equipment and build your base. The basebuilding is quite solid, it supports placing (and re-replacing but not re-packaging) of components, turrets, doors, and several special constructions like mines or a surgical station used to quickly replenish your hp.Basebuilding is by far the most interesting part of the game right now, it's lacking in other areas (pve is quite repetitive) but the sandbox character makes up for it.So should you buy this game? If you like sandbox games, which allow for big base building with a lot of pieces to choose from, you will be happy in this game...keep in mind however other players can attack your home, so defend it well and build it up in a remote area ;) Also, shooting huge alien bugs is fun."

This game is much better than the year old reviews i read on this thread. I was thinking that it would be some sort of run-of-the-mill colony building, griefing, hero based RTS, no no no no ... The game is a survival shooter, you set out into the wilderness and theres a 70% chance you'll be dead if you get greedy or aren't smart.. You are afraid of dying unlike a lot of games.. You can build yourself a Terraria style base in the middle of nowhere and it will persist forever, your own little wilderness secret stash spot,. Phew, finally you can get 1 minute without stressing.. but dont worry about building anything until you somehow survive long enough to save cash without 3 straight failed missions.. expensively repairing your gear in shame... Griefing or player killing? Unless you're dumb enough to build near a public drop zone, you're lucky to even see another player, hell, youre excited to see someone else because the world is so enormous and you're so alone, so very alone..PROS:- Survival is hard and fun, you earn everything you get, returnign to base is a pleasure, not a chore- Desolation, you feel very alone and vulnerable,- Game concept is ambitious and new.. a giant sci fi shooter open world with sandbox survival elements. though in early stages right now.CONS:- The combat seems ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and basic in the tutorial but enter the game and you soon develop your own tricks to fight      and survive in the wilderness and you stop noticing the crap early 2000's style shooter mechanics because you're always 20 seconds from near death.- missions diversity is low, only a few available right now, probably the last thing on the Devs minds until the game is fleshed out more- not much player interaction. This is where the ""colonies"" concept wont play a role until the player base has grown post-release where i think the intention is to group together to ppol resources and make areas of control. An ambitious idea at such an early stage, but could be big if it works."

They are currently working on resolving this issue but the problem has been around for months.Everyone agrees that the game has potential but gamers need to be informed about the current status of the game. I cannot recommend Colonies Online at this time. Reason being:- Very low player population: Even when adding the total number of players not on steam.- Buggy combat/frameskipping and server lag is evident- Weapon not reloading properly bug- Item descriptions needs to be corrected and redone- Severe grind heavy gameplay combined with the extremely high cost for items- Incomplete storyline and general direction- Customers of ATT internet service cannot gain access to the main website- Tutorial needs to be corrected and redone- Takes a long time to allow steam players to bypass the client launcher before you can jump into the game. (This will happen everytime you try to play Colonies Online)The game looks to be in the early early stages of alpha. Many players have accused the developers of giving up on the game but there have been updates.I do not believe the game is worth 5 dollars in it's current state. There is just too much work to be done before they can call it finished. I believe it would be years before that dream becomes reality. And by that time many people would have already forgotten such an outdated existed. You have been warned.

With a combination of base building, monster hunting, looting, exploration, PVE and PVP the game really could pack a punch.  However that is the idea of the game, not the actual game in its current state.The ""shell"" on offer is very limited.  Walking, shooting, looting, basic base building are all there.  But that's it.   With limited features, repetitive situations, and no real feeling of accomplishment, this game feels more like being stuck in a plain cardboard box rather than a space aged adventure.I bought the Dreadnaught pack to get an extra copy so my brother and I could play, and I have to admit that this is the first time I regret buying a game on steam.Keep an eye on this game though.  It could turn out well.  However, that would require the investment of the developers, who at this stage, have promised a show, sold the tickets, but ran off with the cash.

,Not Recommended,283100,16864069,"Posted: 3 July, 2015",all,Asvarduil,"Once upon a time, Bruce Willis dressed up in some power armor, and went on an interplanetary joy ride in a UNSC shuttle.  It got shot down over a strange planet infested with bugs and giant floating jellyfish that shoot lasers!  What did he do next?  This is his tale.Colonies Online is a top-down MMO shooter - in my experience, completely unique - where you shoot stuff and build outposts.  I didn't play it very much, because it's horrible.  You're about to learn why.What WorksFirst, the game is redeemable.  The visuals are OK, and the basic controls generally make a degree of sense.  I didn't have too much trouble using my character.The laser on the weapon helps the player understand where they're shooting, which is a very nice touch in this sort of game; specifically it helps you lead enemies who are moving tangent to where you're trying to shoot.What Doesn't WorkI didn't get past the first planet (the one you crash on), because I didn't really want to.  A lot of things contributed to this.First, the UI is completely horrible, from a usability standpoint.  Pretty much, the UI just doesn't make sense - I couldn't figure out how toequip a weaponthat I bought in the crash site, for starters.  A little later, at Camp Delta, I found a storage chest with armor in it, but I couldn't equip it for some reason.  Long story short, the UI is just plain broken.  I don't honestly know how people play this game; I assume there's some way of circumventing the UI.  I recommend they rethink the UI from the ground up.Second, even with the lengthy tutorial text (there's a lot) I didn't know really what to do.  What the tutorial text told me to do, and what I actually could do, were nearly always completely at odds with one another.  The tutorial was useless because it made no sense.One thing I was looking forward to was the base building and crafting.  I really enjoy crafting in MMO games, when I'm not bashin' skulls and splittin' noobs.  However...for the life of me I could not figure out where to begin.  Sure, killing monsters gives random drops, but I couldn't figure out how or where to do any crafting.  There were no indications of how to take on a tradeskill (if those even exist in this game), or anything else.Additionally, the base construction is well-hidden as well.  Since crafting is well-hidden from players, I can only assume the developers don't yet want people making stuff, because when I found the base part vendor in Camp Delta, I couldn't figure out how to get even the least expensive parts to set down to make the foundation of a base.The TL;DRI gave this game a chance, and it failed, horribly.  Pretty much, this game is awful.  Itcouldbe great, but it's not - the UI fights the player at all opportunities, preventing them from doing anything worthwhile.  It's not worth $14.99.  It's not worth two hours of game time.  I've already requested my refund.This game isn't ready for Steam, or for the public at all.  The developer has someseriouswork to do on this game."

So with that, the game is ""very basic"" and only leaves you with two options: Farm bugs or search for pvp.The game itself looks like it can be a great purchase in the long run, right now I can see some people being easily turned off, just because they have not made it user friendly (no options menu, no guide, and somewhat hard to figure out mapping system)I would recommend people to try out the game, but I would also recommend trying it with a friend. Going solo can be slow and frustrating, but rewarding. Grouping up with a friend added a different element as there is friendly fire in the game.To touch base on the pvp aspect, on the intial world there is no pvp and no construction, so you do not really have to worry about griefers. When you feel ready you can try going to the next planet. First you need to figure out how to travel (again no guides, but after asking in chat someone instructed me). You need to find and purchase a ILU (Individual Landing Unit) and select a planet, then select a sector on that planet to go to. Each sector is HUGE and there are over 10-15 sectors on each planet, so getting ganked repeatedly should not be an issue.Overall I am having fun with it.  I Suggest trying it out, but keep in mind that this game is still really young."

With that being said here is what I have found:Overall rating: 7/10 (Has great promise but needs a lot of attention).1. Pros* Free roam and exploration. (This game is a sand box), And each planet is MASSIVE. Area wise.* Colony building (Currently in a rudimentory form but shows promise once they develop and add crafting and other managment abilities and structures such as a player run market system.) You can however build your colony anywhere you like, Although the limitation of where you can deploy an ILU (Individual Landing Unit, which is basically an item that allows you to travel to other planets and other sectors on a planet. You can walk across the entire suface unhendored if you want of a single planet, but they are huge, and it is much easier to simply travel via your ILU)* Quests are straight forward, though can be difficult to understand your objective ""location"" wise. As there are no markers. However this is countered by the fact that there are few, as this game focuses on the player, and is about you. The quest in generally simply serve more as a ""Tutorial"" as you play the game giving you tips on occasion, the any real quest purposes.* Gear is fairly easy to aquire and upgrade (though you will have to aproach it intelligently in order to get anything quickly, It's mostly about farming mobs currently and searching for special drops to sell for Armor and gear ""Until the crafting system is in place"").* NOT PAY TO WIN. The stuff you can pay for with real money (Pyromanser, Dreadnaught, and Citizen packs), are of Medium gear levels. The armor is 6/8 (8 being the highest current protection level in game), and the weapon does about 300 - 375 DPS with varying ranges (Where as the best weapons in game do 500-700+ DPS).The pyromancer pack has a Flamethrower which is really nice for a new player, but has a very short range which can cause killing some of the mobs to be more difficult (Many of the mobs are quite a chalenge to kill and range is a tactic). The Citizen pack and Dreadnaught pack both have long range weapons.- The only difference between these pack Weapons/Armor and the Medium level gear you can get in game is that the weapons have a larger ammo clip (About double that of the normal medium in game weapon of the same veriety). The best weapons and Armor in game however,  can only be obtained through playing the game.* Updates it seems are done 1-3 times a month. And Major issues are generally fixed soon.* Game is decently pretty to look at with many differnt environments, graphics are not too shabby either, though they could use some work.* Open world non restricted PVP, (With recent updates even your colony can be set to shoot other people :D )2. Cons:* The game is a bit laggy server wise, and Rubber banding can cause you to die on occasion which can be a bit anoying. Your weapon wont relaod correctly and it will lag out and the Mobs will kill you. Or you'll simply rubberband back into their line of fire at times. I caontribute this however to the game being new. Overall this should not interfere with your playtime.* There are no Guides so to speak for the game or real tutorials or information on how to do stuff, and the website is not very active. So figureing stuff out can be difficult at times, but hey some would actually count this as a Pro, rather then a con.* Occasionaly your game will crash while killing a Queen. You'll still get the loot (Thankfully) but you'll have to relog in or restart the client.* When loading to another planet or loading in general, the game can get stuck on the loading screen, In my experience it happens about 3/10 times. And you ahve to restart the client. (Again thankfully, you don;t need to load very often at all as you can just walk everywhere once your on a planet).* The game is set in a top down slightly angled view, much like the original fallouts. Not being able to tilt the camera and look at your suroundings is a bit anoying. You can however, unlike in fallout 1 and 2 and tactics, turn the camera, you just can't tilt it. I count this as a con because the game worls is really pretty in a lot of ways and it's a shame you really can't look at it all from different angles. But maybe they will add that later.Conclusion:Overall I think this game shows great promise, I can contribute many of the cons to being in early development, Mining and Crafting and research are supposed to be added soon, and I can;t wait for them.Over all, the largest issue with this game currently are probably 3 things:* Crashes* Stuck on Loading* Rubberbanding / LagBut it is in early develoment and release and currently sits are a Mid alpha, Pre beta form. So depending on your ability to deal with some of the cons above, it may be a great idea for you to give this game a try. Or not.I am usually in game, My name is Malefic, and Yvira snow. Send me a whisper if you need any help or anything if you decide to play and give this game a chance."

,Recommended,283100,10024513,"Posted: 4 May, 2014",all,Linkthehobo,"Surprisingly Fun with some great mechanics. I was put off by the seemingly ""OP"" Early Access pack weapons until I realized that nearly EVERY weapon in the game will destroy a 50hp player in no time. The DPS on weapons matters little in PVP, but is a great help in farming PvE or attempting to take down a base shield(Has not yet been done with the 2000 shields !). The communities in the game are slowly growing, and the danger of losing your hard work is real, but intelligence and some good design sense will allow any player to create a near unbreakable fortress. Although as more and more players acquire top tier weapons shields will likely fall, meaning you will need to band together and push deep into the heart of uncharted sectors to construct your hideaways and bases.Worth the price to purchase Early Access IMO. Group play is hilarious, high energy and enjoyable. Periods of downtime and large maps mean you might not see another player or you may see five, it is all going to come down to visibility on Steam for this title, and it does have the potential to be a gem in my opinion.This game is for HARDCORE PvP players and players who enjoy building and PvE Alien Swarm esque shooters. I enjoy the fact that nobody is safe, while also being able to protect yourself quite well. Groups of 10+ have been unable to breech my shields, so I've lost only a single base so far. Check out the Citizen Pack Option and get keys to your friends while you can! The packs are likely to be removed from Steam within a week.Hope to see you all ingame soon!"

It took about 10 mins just for one of the tutorial tips asking me to kill things and loot them to change (after NO ENEMIES EVER SHOWED UP!) into ""This is how you use your weapon and reload it."" Well, normally you would do those things and the tutorial tip would move on to the next step. No, spent the next 20 mins killing enemies that FINALLY showed up along with some other players, and the tool tip never moved on. Still couldn't loot anything either by the way, so the previous step was a complete bust. Also, the framerate was entirely unacceptable for this day and age. Felt like I was playing on Dial-Up. Yeah, I'm THAT old.I like the idea here, but so far it is FAR beyond even playable. ""Early Release"" should never mean we just began developing and threw some shoddy pieces of a game together just so people could ""feel"" like there might someday maybe perhaps be something worthy buried underneath all the crap. That's more like a ""Hey we have this really cool idea we'd like money put into so we can develop it. Heres some early stuff we did, pay us so we can keep developing."" That's a Kickstarter problem, not an ""Early Release"" deal. I like what Steam is doing to help the gaming community, but let's not polish a turd and call it gold, let's be honest about what you're selling. If it's not ""about to be released"" or ""almost ready"", let's not call it ""Early Release"", let's call it ""Early Development."" Otherwise, you're just wiping turd all over our gold.I will revise this review if and when this game is ready to call itself playable, and if I ever bother to play it again.
