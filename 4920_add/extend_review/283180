76561197989132185,Recommended,283180,9874451,"Posted: 19 April, 2014",all,pulp-reduced,"So I bought this game solely based on the fact that it was published by Screen 7, the same company that published The Cat Lady, a fantastic point and click adventure in the same vein as this one. Despite this my hopes weren't set too high. See, I don't play these puzzlegames very often. And if I do, I mostly look up solutions if I don't find them myself within a certain amount of time, depending on how patient I feel that day. I couldn't do that here, so at points it was a scramble to find somebody who could help me(which I am ever so grateful for, grateful to the ones that helped me in moments of desperation). At points it was mindlessly trying every possible combination of items and move-sets to get things to work. This game was hard. I mean, it switched between real world logic and videogame logic in a way that really kept you on your toes - or made you bash your face repeatedly into a wall. This game is intelligent, especially when it comes to puzzle design. Every puzzle I didn't get at first, but later figured out(when I did it on my own), made me impressed by the way the game designer set it up. It wasn't a case of finding out what you missed and then feeling like an idiot(not as much as some games make you feel, at least).There are parts of this game where I felt the need to write down symbols to crack a code, in real life. One could say I got invested into my character, immersed, even! Although I am not too sure how necessary it was, but post-FEZ I have a tendency to write down ciphers games give me. I truly love how games give you a mindset that you can use throughout the whole game. Where there are audial timings, visual timings, that takes play in the puzzles. Which is useful to have in mind during the whole game. The Samaritan Paradox doesn't drop parts of itself. It's a neat parcel. Puzzlegames can easily feel contrived at points, but this game didn't suffer from that same nuisance. Everything felt organic and was explained through story and environment.The story:We play as the suitably named Ord(Ord means Word in Swedish). He is a cryptologist working on his Ph.D, only he's lost all momentum. His life is boring, he spends the days vacantly listening to the vapid, dull voices coming from the TV. As we get reign of his movement, we decide to check the newspaper. A famous author committed suicide! It happens to be the same author that our friend (Magnus) conveniently gave us a book from, making us recognize the name. We call Magnus and tell him about this code we found in the first page of the book, you know, being a cryptologist and all, it happens. Not contrived. He suggests we should contact the authors daughter and let her know of this amazing find! ""There's one more"", as in one more posthumous book from said author. Ord contacts her and with his trustful face, gets her(Sara) to hire him, as her very own professional puzzle solver. With a supportive friend, and his well-meaning wish to give us back our lack of momentum through deadly adventure, we are unstoppable.The Samaritan Paradox, it's all in the name really. Being this righteous, ivory tower-moral guider, being this way because of guilt. Making it the Samaritan Paradox. One is only good because of the blood that has already been drawn. It takes an act of evil to become lawful good. And when this moral highroad is nothing but a series of half-baked ideas and semi-researched claims, what good is the actual good side? The game doesn't say much beyond this, I suppose it doesn't have to. The game does leave you with a lot of questions, is the momentum from this adventure enough to fuel his thesis? Will the emotional damage Sara runs away from never come back to haunt her? Will suppression and delirium make reality less pungent? What happened with Magnus and the dinner date? What about the thesis? And the unpayed bills? I guess thinking too much about it doesn't change what's actually there. In the games universe everything ended happily ever after. The mirror image of reality based gameplay with reality based story would be nice, to me. But then again, only for the sake of symmetry. At times things may work out, lives can be lived happily in worlds of violence and corruption. Just try not to be cognizant of them. Spewing vague criticism is so much more fun. It makes you a good person. Everything is starting to feel like a paradox now.This game is a corroborative delight. A hard and frustrating delight. Piquant visual style and, in truth, at points beautiful. Clever writing and puzzles that are always challenging are to be expected. I was not let down by this purchase. It took me the whole day to complete, and what a day it's been. It was exciting, truly. An intriguing detective story mixed with a fantasy side-story paralleled with the real one. A metaphorical storyline beside the real, adding a whole new layer to the game. A nice escape from the mundane cityscapes, it kept the game fresh and provided some real nice landscapes.Apart from some of the voice acting(which is to be expected from a lower-budget title), everything was excellent. If you are not too put off by the pixel art I would wholeheartedly recommend this game, it's cheap and it has at least 8 hours in it, if you solve puzzles quickly. Enjoy!By the way, be aware of some bugs that could make progressing weird, save the game as often as conveniently possible, if things seem wrong, they probably are."
76561198051141615,Recommended,283180,9906430,"Posted: 22 April, 2014",all,camocat_28,"Good old fashioned pixel hunting game with some fiendishly difficult puzzles.Story: The storyline is divided into two: you play as Ord, and as the heroine of the last book written by the writer. The first gets more and more complicated as you search for more book chapters and delve deeper into the writer's life. The part you play in the book has a fairy tale feel to it which offers a nice contrast. There were some surprising twists towards the end but I thought the game concluded with the loose ends tied up neatly.Graphics: reminiscent of earlier LucasArts' titles.Music: subtle and well-matched for the different sections of the game.Voice acting: I thought this was very well done, as all the voices were convincing and no overacting. Ord Salamon sounds just like a mild-mannered cryptologist/PhD student who is described by his friend as ""the police use the photo of your face to calm rioters"".Gameplay: I spent around 5 or 6 hours so far on this game and only just got to Day 3. But I am getting on in years so perhaps the whippersnappers will get through faster.Overall: highly recommended if you like a good detective thriller with challenging puzzles."
,Recommended,283180,12439665,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,hummakaluva,"About me: I love adventures, especially the old Lucas Arts games.I liked it. Good, difficult puzzles, some frustratingly so, but ultimately all with very sound, everyday logic. Exception are a very few time sensitive puzzles. The story and characters are for the most part very well written. I particularily liked the ""two worlds"" gameplay, which offsets the rather serious and sombre tone of the main story. Do not expect a lighthearted experience. The retro pixelated look is okay, backgrounds are nicely painted and animations well done.Minor annoyances are the idiosyncracies of the dialogue system, where sometimes you just have to click through all  the possible topics until you find the one that actually does advance the story. Also some inconsistencies in characters statements when old topics don't get updated responses after major plot developments.I do however, have two major issues with the writing: For one, the developing friendship between the two main characters felt rather forced to me.  The other isthat the surprising last minute story twist wasn't surprising for me. It also feels like it has only been put in for the emotional impact. The result is that it is rather jarring, but not because you are shocked by what has happend, but because it feels completely disconnected from the rest of the main plot.Conclusion: Do play it, and resist the lure of the walkthrough."

The story was pretty interesting, complete with a sick twist; the puzzles were fairly challenging and varied; and the graphics, though pixelated to bring old point-and-clicks to mind, have fairly fluid movement that make sense (ex: when a character goes to pick something up, more than just an arm and their knees move; you see the whole body move). I absolutely adored playing in the story's fantasy setting (and not just because I'm Freja's VO, either). If you like puzzles, mysteries, and nostalgia, I'd recommend this game."

The graphics is a little bit too static, but very bound to the 90's! The riddles are good and not too hard to solve. I hope there will be a sequel, because I liked the idea of a cryptologist as main character."

The UI and certain puzzles can be frustrating at times and the ending felt a bit rushed and out of place but overall I thought the game to be pretty enjoyable."

It's an incredibly and challenging dark story recreated in a retro style environment. Also the puzzles in the game are nicely clever and make the player have a good time solving it.

,Recommended,283180,10566050,"Posted: 20 June, 2014",all,cheatatjoes,"It's a great story, intelligently told, although the voice acting is sometimes cringe-inducing. The tough puzzles are fun, but some of the sequences are a bit forced, and didn't add anything to the plot. The crossword stands out as a point where the writers were just trying to drag out the game unnecessarily. More often than not, I was simply stumped by the graphics; there were a lot of key set pieces that were tough to make out, meaning I never thought to mouseover them in order to find my next clue.That said, the overall pacing and general plot are quite brilliant. It's a dark tale, and certainly won't be one I forget anytime soon."

It's in the style that I remember and is really quite exceptional. Well written original story together with some clever and interesting puzzles. I struggled with some of them but discovered I could phone other game characters who would sometimes provide clues. Nifty. Now I'm interested in Adventure games again and will seek out more.

Kinda cool, some interesting concepts maybe, but largely forgettable . This one really started to stand apart for me once you start reading the book and are transported into the story. The puzzles are fiendishly difficult. Just as I was congratulating myself for besting the dragon with no guide help, I get absolutely crushed on the most insane ""8 queens"" puzzle I've ever encountered. I figured out that the harpy constellation is important, I figured out the chest numbers. I even solved the 8 queens puzzle on my own. But would I have ever figured out, without a guide, thatthe 8 queens puzzle had a twist, and that not only did the queens have to be out of check with each other, but they had to represent the harpy constellation as well?I don't think so."

Some puzzles are pretty clever, but most are uninspired or kind of weird. What makes The Samaritan Paradox stand out is its two concurrent storylines: the political thriller in the present (investigating the death, searching for the novel) and the fantasy story segments (the chapters of the novel). However, the ending slaps you in the face with incredibly dark/sensitive subject matter in a really crass and weird way and that soured the whole experience for me. I am angry now even seeing this game in my library."

,Not Recommended,283180,18203398,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,Tenchuu Khan,"While the synchro and artstyle are great, the writing and puzzles are just awful.This game is so cryptic that it's hard to find how to even quit it.After 5 hours I had to pull the plug on this because I couldn't bare with it any longer.It already starts rather awkwardly by this phenomenal scenario:You're a cryptologist, a friend gives you a dull crime thriller to get away from cryptology for once... and the first page contains a code.How do you decipher the code? Read the newspaper first and find out that the guy who wrote the book had a daughter which is a chemist or whatever to which the code seems to be addressed to.After you solve the code you travel to her and she's like: oh yea, my father left behind those riddles for me.... but I won't do them, you go ahead and do them. It may lead to his money...Yea, it's really delivered that dull.Now, the goal is to find one of his other books which is a secret and every time you find another part of the book, you are in the story itself which just throws more cryptic **** at you.I liked the riddle in the first part here actually but ran into a bug and eventually had to use a walkthrough. Even if you know how to do it you might still have to repeat it a few times because the game has a thing for making things fly by faster than you can click anything and that sends you back then.So it's sorta asks for some egoshooter reflexes as well.Next few things were reasonable until you have to enter a bunker where you find the second part.The issue here is, you can't ask anyone about the riddle you have to solve so it's solely up to you to get 4 numbers out of abstract sentences. I could decipher exactly one, and was baffled by the rest - no clue who would actually figure that out.After I started reading the second part I just had to stop because I got tired of the storytelling.Bottom line - I'm all for challenging riddles and what not but if it requires me to know music theory and greek mythology and make the right guess then this game wants me to play with a walkthrough.Which is no fun for me of course. Screw this."

By not doing so it made the ending unbelievable, jarring and a shock to the system like an electrified anvil. Most of the characters except Ord could do with more development too.
