,Not Recommended,283230,10998049,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,Bumperguard,"This game is way too easy and way too short. After 44 minutes I have 100% achievement progress; I beat the game in just under half an hour. Watching the credits is the most time consuming achievement.The longest level of the game takes about 12 seconds to complete, there are several levels where you just need to jump one or two times to complete it.You get a gold medal if you beat the level first try, but you can easily reset the level via the escape menu, so every try counts as first try. Since there are no checkpoints, there is no difference except in hearing the first 20 seconds of the music over and over again.The idea for the game is nice, but it is not enough. You are automatically running backwards and mostly just jump over obstacles. It's a very bad and very easy version of Bit Trip Runner. In the whole game (including bonus stages and everything) you just use the Up-Key to jump and in about 30 levels you use the Z-Key for ""actions"". The actions are NEVER challenging. The hardest parts of the game include about 3 pixel-perfect jumps, you have to master. But because the levels are so short and you can restart them as you want, you will get these jumps by luck or training within one minute.For achievement hunters like me, this game might be quite acceptable, since it is an easy 100% in less than an hour (10 achievements total).But if you want to play a game for fun and/or challenge, you should rather play Runner 2. And if you like the concept of playing a game ""backwards"", try out Braid. It's not exactly that, but it has many elements of what is on your mind.To be constructive, what the game needs:- More challenge (e.g. don't have one ""action skill"" at a time, but have them all, so you use more than just 2 keys)- Better level design and longer levels- Another concept for getting Gold medals (e.g. don't have a time paradoxon, but give Gold to those, who can undo every object of the level)- I think, this would be nicer, if you did not auto-run; although you then had to rethink the whole concept of the game- Make more things, that make the game ""backwardsy"", like: A very high jump move, with which you can reach high platforms (from which the character originally fell down), but if you don't reach a high platform with the jump, you have a paradoxonAll in all: Don't buy it for more than 1€ or $. It's not worth it.PS: There might be Workshop-Userlevels, that are better than the games original levels, but I rated the game here and not usermade content. The game itself should be good enough for a play and the userlevels should be an extra."

You play the entire game running backwards on a 2D-platform, and the only thing to do is jumping at the right moment (and once in a while catching some objects). Maybe the idea is slightly original, but the execution certainly is not: everything in this little platformer has been done lots of time before, and in a much better way. Most of the jumps are fairly easy, but some require split-second accuracy.Games like this depend for their succes to a large extent on the quality of the level-design, and that's whereSpoiler Alertfails miserably. Almost all of the levels are short to the extreme: most only last 10 (!!) seconds. Granted, there are a hundred of them in total, but the final feeling is one of complete desintegration.Regrettably, graphics aren't great either: they have some retro-feeling, but not enough to make them cute; the repetitive music ennerved me a lot. All in all, this game is only there for gamers who want the trading cards (some of these tend to sell for above average prices), and the 10 achievements are fairly easy, so this one is recommended for those who want their 100% completed list being upped by one. Otherwise, I can't find any good reason to play this one.Overall score: 4/10"
76561197960956046,Not Recommended,283230,12753912,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,Kaizer,"The game's entire gimmick is that you play it entirely in reverse. You unkill enemies, uncollect coins, etc. It sounds interesting and novel but after 15-20 levels, it gets rather boring. The levels are VERY short (like less than 10 seconds short), and the hit detection is atrocious and inconsistent.It plays like the original Super Mario Bros on NES (and that's a generous comparison), but a super lite version.Your character moves on his own (backwards) at a set speed and the only control you really have is the up arrow to jump. The length of holding up doesn't appear to make a difference in your length of jump. On one level (out of 100), you can actually make him change directions... again, only on one level. On a handful of levels you have to catch a projectile with z (to unfire said projectile). Each level must be completed a specific way, so there is no experimenting, exploring, or even figuring something out. You cannot choose whether to collect a coin or not, or kill this enemy or not. Each level is essentially press up 2-5 times at the exact moment the game wants you to; Succeed and go to a new combination or fail and do it again until you don't fail.A nitpick is that the levels actually get harder as you get closer to the beginning of the game, which makes sense in a progression sort of way, but doesn't in aI'm getting close to the very beginning of the gamebut either way this would be difficult to manage.Bottom line:the game takes maybe an hour to 100% complete it, getting all of the achievements. It takes longer to get all the trading cards to drop than to complete the game. It does come with a level creator but I did not mess with it.If it's under $1 and you want to add a perfect game to your achievement list then by all means get it, but I really cannot recommend it to anyone looking for fun. 0.5/10"

,Recommended,283230,11095218,"Posted: 5 July, 2014",all,jingface,"Summary: An interesting take on platform games. Imagine someone beating a game without killing all the bosses or collecting all the gold, then you have to retrace their steps in reverse. Cute graphics and sprites all around.PROS: Replay value. I wanted to get perfect for all the levels, which required more than two replays on about half the levels. I loved the visuals across the board. The angry trees and cactii were my favorite!CONS: Pretty short game. Although there were levels I had to replay over 10x, there were plenty I blew through in one go. You could blow through this game in about an hour.Suggestions to the makers: I really would have liked to see more of the story! I think the general atmosphere and humor could be played up even more. It would be a great reward to unlock a comic (or some kind of story aspect) in between worlds. For example, some comics that go more into Chili Pepper and the boss of each world's history? And maybe another bonus for getting all the achievements? Maybe if there is a sequel to Spoiler Alert, these could help make the game feel fuller."

In this time, I managed to beat the game, make a phone call, beat the game again to get gold on every level, make another phone call, grab a smoke, beat mariarchi mode on gold, eat some pudding and do a playthrough in speedrunner mode. Basically, I experienced everything the game has to offer. For 6€ (~8$ ?), that seems like an awfully short time of questionable fun.Why questionable fun? While the concept seems nice enough, at its core the game is still a platformer. And for a platformer, it's really bad. Jump height can't be controlled, which is a very basic platforming feature since kinda forever, the collision checks feel off etc. And while it is kind of understandable why, not being able to stop running just makes it a weird mix of a far too easy puzzle game and a bad platformer.The gimmick itself (playing in reverse) doesn't help either, once you realize that if you would replay a level in the normal, non-reversed direction, you could never recreate your reversed run. If it even is possible at all to complete the level non-reversed, which isn't always the case. This kinda ruins the gimmick, as in terms of gameplay, this just makes it a normal platformer, only you run to the left and things can kill you by not touching them.Final rating?1/10, would not buy again.

There are many problems that I'd like to address when talking about this game so to save space taken up by paragraphs; I'm going to do this in list form.Problem 1: Game Length/ Replay ValueThe game is extremely short which wouldn't be a problem, if the game had any replay value. Some might argue that yes, there is a level editor built in but that doesn't redeem the fact that overall, most levels are beat in under 10 seconds. There are 90 levels in the main game and 10 extra levels in the ""mariachi"" mode for a grand total of 100 levels. The level design is just plain bad and too repetetive. Overall I got just over an hour of playtime in and I have every single achievement.Problem 2: A Copy/Paste GameThere are a total of 3 ""powerups"" in the game (one in each of the three worlds) and they are all clones of each other. They require for something to fly at you and you press a button at the right time. That's it. Quite boring really. Not just that but there are about 10 enemies in the main game (excluding the 3 ""bosses"") but they're all clones of the same three enemies. The ones that move back in forth on the ground, the ones that move back and forth in the air and the ones that shoot a projectile.The music is also extremely repetitive and not that it's necessarilybad, it's just forgettable.Problem 3: Trial and ErrorNo death ever feels like it's your fault and in this type of game, that's essential. Every death kept me feeling like the game was ""cheating"" me. Most of the time, you'll die because something flew out of nowhere leaving you without time to react. Thinking back to games like those in theMegamanfranchise and even more recent games likeSuper Meat Boywho have each received extensive praise are loved because everytime you die it feels like it's your fault. It feels like a fair death. Spoiler Alert unfortunately lacks that feeling of ""fairness"" that has become so crucial to a succesful game in this genre.In conclusionthis game has a novel concept, don't get me wrong. But all in all, it's just poorly executed. I wouldn't reccomend this game to my friends or really anyone and that's why I would give Spoiler Alert  a2/10"

If you do otherwise, then you need to do the whole level from start due to a ""time paradox"": It would be kinda strange to have, when you play a platform game, invisible coins that would turn visible when touched, right?The music is present the whole game and is neither intrusive nor impressive. The thing I remember the most about this game sound effects is the kinda reversed sound that plays when you get a coin. So overall, the sound aspect is not memorable but add to the game response feeling.The graphics are kinda cartoon-like and simple and I really enjoyed them. The only thing I would complain about is that there are only a few different sprites but why this is will be seen more in depth after. The animations are smooth.Now on the gameplay side. Even though the game is enjoyable, there are some dark sides that taint it in my opinion: Sadly, the game is so that you have only one possibility to complete the levels: The devs have decided on one path, one moment to jump or press Z (special powers), this is to say, they decided exactly which pieces are invisible and which enemies are dead. Between this and the length of one level (between 5 and 20 seconds depending on the level), the game falls a bit short and sadly, the level design is really simple which can make it quite repetitive at the end of the 100 levels.It includes 10 bonus levels and a speedrun mode (You just play the game again without it asking you to press 'Z' when you finish a level.Collector's edition includes a level editor.I think 3 extra dollars for the level editor and some external to the game content is quite expensive.

There is not enough variety to keep it entertaining for all 100 levels and the one gimmick will get old. The lack of proper settings is also a downside that Spoiler Alert suffers.

You can use any item or platform from the game and then upload it the game's Steam Workshop!Solid controls.Spoiler Alert can be played by using a controller or keyboard and mouse, both have very solid controls.SpeedRunner mode.A mode where you can replay levels in order to try and get better times. It's a nice feature.Achievements.Spoiler alert includes 10 achievements. All of them are relatively easy to get, making it good for completionists or people who just like to get 100% achievements in games.The price.The $2.99 price tag is a fair price for the game. The game can also be found in some game bundles. It also goes on sale here on Steam and on other sites.The graphics.The hand drawn, flash style graphics are very colorful and suit the tone of the game very nicely.The Bad:One gimmick.The game only has one main idea / gimmick in it: playing the game backwards (and avoiding time paradoxes). This gets old far before the end (start?) of the game. It was a good concept, but needed more in order to make it fun for the entire story.Short, easy, repetitive levels.All of the levels included in Spoiler Alert, including the boss levels, are incredibly short. They take a minute or two to beat, depending on if you mess up or not. However, you probably won't mess up since the levels are very easy as well, repeating the same functions as other levels.No replay value.There is only one way to do each level. Once the levels are done there is pretty much no point in playing them again.Easy boss battles.I get that making concepts for boss battles that go backwards to quite challenging, but the bosses in Spoiler Alert are way too easy. The boss battle for the first (last?) world only consists of jumping on the head of the boss a few times.No resolution options.Screen resolution options really should be included in a PC game, even if it's a simple indie game. There is a fullscreen option, however if you play in windowed you are locked in an oddly sized window."

In some ways, it could have been harder for experienced games than new ones because flies in the face of platforming conventions. Things you would normally avoid, you now need to hit and vice versa. You can’t go on reflex, which slows you down and gets you killed.Unfortunately, it just never lives up to its full potential. The levels are just way to short and easy. Most levels can be beat in less than 10 seconds, so a perfect run of the game should take less than 15 minutes. I was able to beat the entire game, including the bonus level, with 1.2 hours of play time. The thing is, most levels just feel like in-game tutorials - even the ones late in the game. There were some levels with challenging jumps, but they are few and far between.There are some places with flat out poor design, where the only way to know where you need to jump is to have prior knowledge of the level. The means that the game is reduced to rote learning. You do it again and again until you've memorized the patterns and specific jump locations. This isn't throughout the entire game, but it crops up a lot near the end. Less than great controls also mean that sometimes you die just because the game didn't respond in time. Near perfect response time needed on your part combined with less than perfect response time on the part of the game makes for an irritating experience.On the plus side, there is a level editor, so you can make your own. Modding ability does, of course, make any game better. That said, it shouldn't be up to the people who paid for the game to have to finishing making it. The Bonus Content also includes a speed-run mode, in which you play the entire 90-level game as a single level. This is the only area where making a perfect run is difficult, but you also have to deal with every single flawed design at once, meaning getting a perfect score is dependent on luck as much as skill and experience.So, is it worth a dollar or two? Maybe. I don't regret the hour I spend with it, but there are plenty of other things I could have bought with my money. I would say keep an eye on the game, and if new level sets come out, then re-evaluate."

You need to unkill squashed enemies, put coins back where you got them and catch back the fireballs you used to incinerate enemies. All the while avoiding creating a time paradox e.g. picking up a coin that you never picked up. The same music plays over and over again.You have no control over directional movement. You character moves left continually while you tell it when to jump and when to grab fireballs. The time I played was about enough time to complete the first of 3 worlds. So it looks like if you want a few hours out of the game you would probably need to download other user made levels. Apparently they can be published on the steam workshop.

The premise holds water for maybe the length of the first world (that you play).Beyond that point the game becomes an increasingly aggravating series of mechanics and enemies with progressively tighter and tighter windows for you to jump on/over, and increasingly nonexistent telegraphs to prompt your jumps. One level requires an almost pixel-perfect jump over an enemy situated unnecessarily high up. Another requires you to jump the INSTANT you have control of your character or you'll fail the first jump of the level. One enemy type is introduced with a very tight movement pattern that it later defies entirely in the name of screwing you over in the dickiest way possible. And to cap it all off, thebrilliantmechanic by which the game grades your performance is number of deaths since you entered the level -- which resets each time you back out to the menu. So if you care about your level grades, just waste a few seconds backing out to the menu after each death rather than attempting to run the level deathless twice in a row.At no point did I feel like the rising difficulty was an entertaining challenge, nor did it feel satisfying to overcome it. It felt like hollow, petty revenge, as if I were punching an old school bully in the face.This game is very successful at being a cautionary tale of why a time-reversed platformer doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work, if nothing else."

,Not Recommended,283230,11287357,"Posted: 17 July, 2014",all,Snort Cannon,Spoiler Alert promises a unique approach to the platformer genre where you uncomplete the game but will you want to uncomplete the game ? In Spoiler Alert you play as the chili knight and you witness the moment where you get to the princess and how his journey begins. So how is this game ? Its actually pretty dull. The game goes in reverse and the only thing that can kill you is a time paradox. Which means unkilling an enemy and putting a coin back in its place and this game is incredibly short and its pretty dull. Now the art style is great i really like the look of the game and the concept is pretty unique but it gets old pretty quick. The game is also kinda buggy. The game is also pretty easy and not a challenge at all. Theres nothing to say about this game that hasnt been said in this Review. Overall a unique game that was executed poorly and this game is not worth your time and money. Only get it on a sale. I give Spoiler Alert a 4/10

76561198049392628,Not Recommended,283230,12929899,"Posted: 13 November, 2014",all,MeHearty,"Playing the game backwards might sound interesting at first but soon reveals some of the flaws that go with it and the gameplay becomes boring right after you got used to the mechanics (which means after a few levels which only take you 5-15 seconds to complete each and are neither very challenging nor especially interesting).The story is thin and lame, the ""plot twist"" very predictable.(You're actually the ""bad guy"" who did not save but kidnap the princess. How original.)Beating the game with all achievements will take maybe an hour or so and even doing all achievements won't keep you hooked for much longer.But something about the achievements is broken anyway (they unlock in game but don't syncronize with steam) and the developer is unwilling to look into any bugs.The only reason why you will see players with play times of more than 2 hours is because they let the game run to get the trading cards.The game does not use cloud saving, despite of saying so in the store.I ""uncompleted"" the game, not because it was that much fun but because I was hoping to find something better in theendbeginning but the real spoiler alert is that I didn't."

You just want another game that you can add to your list of 100% games, because you can easily do that in one sitting with this game.The idea of the game is really great, but where it falls apart is the execution.  Too many times levels need to be beaten by trial and error because the game apparently expects you to be able to tell the future.  It also just didn't do enough with the idea it had.  There could've been a lot of really cool story elements that would've been great to see backwards.  Instead we get three completely disjointed worlds with themes that are given zero reason to exist in the same game."
,Recommended,283230,15368579,"Posted: 14 April, 2015",all,ProtonsZero,"I recommend this game, if you are or want one of the following:1 - You like games made on flash, and plataformers even more so.2 - A game with easy achievements to boost your ""100%"" list.3 - Are going to gift this to a young kid.It's silly, and it's not worth full price.For some reason the jump button (the one of two buttons you will be using the most) sometimes felt irresponsive, the leaderboards and custom levels wouldn't load for me.It feels poorly executed, like the order of the levels was backwards design wise, in a game that uses backwards design... that means, it uses linear design when it shouldn't.It is a good, cute game, but all I see is a lot of wasted potential.Trying to get gold on speedrun mode would be the one thing to make this game gain much more value, but without an achievement to go with it, you'll be ok with getting a bronze.I don't know what time restraints (I feel like this would've been amazing for a game jam) or budget this game was made on but I feel like this could maybe develop an interesting sequel, if more time was spent on plot and design... Aaaand about 6 more worlds of content."
