Not all mercenaries can be hired at the start, but as the game goes on, more will be willing to work for you, for the right price. Those who played XCOM should give this a try, even though this is a dosbox port of the original. The price may make a little sense since its two games in one download.And here's a tip: Be sure the first mercenary you get is Ivan, me speaks Russian in all versions and is a bit expensive, but his marksmanship more than pays off, and he is one of the mercenaries that will work for you in the beginning."

It's from like 20 years ago, so keep that in mind.  Retro!  I like this game because my Mercs have personalities and sometimes interact together.  Some are cool guys, some are racists, one will even murder another during the night.  Do well, and better mercs will agree to join you.  Do poorly and high quality mercs will find work elsewhere.  You also need to scavenge all your equipments and ammo from the levels and enemies, so it appeals to the looting itch in gaming.  You've got to take an island back from some evil guy, one sector at a time.  Trees make you money, money hires mercs, mercs shoot evil guys.  Fun times."
,Recommended,283270,18981351,"Posted: 9 November, 2015",all,Whiteswart,"The father of the king of turn-based squad-sized tactical games – the predecessor of Jagged Alliance 2. This release contains an original game, a campaign about capturing Metavira island from the forces of bad scientist in favor of good scientist… and standalone add-on Deadly Games, which is not holding a story, being just a list of separate missions. Although the challenge of those missions in the Deadly Games makes it a very good tactical game on its own.What is more, Steam now releasing just the same version of the game as GOG – with DosBox, and everything polished and tuned up to the perfect condition. Funny thing is that the game I’m calling the king, the second Jagged Alliance, in gold edition, that Steam sells now… requires quite a bit of fixing, after you’ll install it, but the first game, aged 21 years now, running smoothly out-of-the-box.Some basic info: in the Jagged Alliance you’re settled as the mercenaries commander and entrepreneur, who hires them from some agency via personal notebook, trains them, hones them…  And sending them to death, to capture some sectors of the God-forgotten island somewhere in the Pacific ocean, where inhabits some unique medical panacea plant, which can’t be find anywhere else in the world. Game combines turn-based tactical warfare of little squads of mercs with strategical elements, where you planning your budget, since we’re all know that for every war you need money, money and even more money. Every merc you can hire have some personality, strong and weak points, and stats, which can be trained or dropped, considering your gaming experience. Mercs are calculating your actions, and follow you only when you’re good both with paychecks and strategy on the battlefield.What I’m trying to say there is that even in the first Jagged Alliance we can see many of the elements still considering a highest insignia of top-notch tactical games where you’re operating the small unit of soldiers. I can call the Valkyria Chronicles as an example there, its fun was builded on the same base of interactions between team-mates.Yet… With all good points we see in this game, like interesting and deep mechanic of controlling warfare, resource gathering and interpersonal relationships altogether -  it is really hard to actually recommend buying this game now to anyone not familiar with it already. Even if you are good with the given genre, it might be a very hard experience, considering the fact it is real old-school, without tutorials or playgrounds. Well, in case you are really want to see how things were settling in the game’s GUI 20 years back, or if you’re up to some kind of pilgrimage to the roots of one of the best-game’s-mechanics-ever-made  – OK, give it a shot.My rating is 8/10 (for beautiful eyes of Brenda and extra 1000$ from Jack, obviously)."

I bought it on Steam for $10, which is a steal, and I would gladly pay new game prices for it; it's that good. Everything about the game, from the gameplay, the atmosphere, the music, the depth of strategy, the challenge, etc. is superbly crafted."

,Recommended,283270,29267116,Posted: 15 January,all,Orestes,"This little gem was on 75% discount recently. I had played JA2 extensively, so I decided to try this one too. I didn't regret my decision.Jagged Alliance 1: Gold Edition is an old strategy game with a turn-based combat system. Bear in mind that the graphics are rather dated. That said, the gameplay is very interesting and the replayability value high.Your fighting squad is comprised of mercenaries, who sometimes interact with each other, have special abilities, different characters and cost various amounts of money. Not all of them can be hired immediately, a few wait until the 2nd day or later.The player finds him/herself in Metavira, a tormented country, which is terrorized by an evil land owner (or something like that). In the beginning he controls all areas and the player must try to recapture the country gradually, so that he/she gains money to hire even more mercenaries and become more powerful.I had a great time playing this game, I would highly recommend it!"

,Recommended,283270,18968901,"Posted: 9 November, 2015",all,Fugue,"This was always a classic and is still so playable. The original contains the basic sector by sector, day by day  combat, and so long as you get a foothold you can spend some time healing injuries and repairing weaponry when you need to, while your guards protect you from counter attacks.Deadly Games instead provides a set mission by mission campaign that means you will really struggle with injuries unless you're save-scumming or replaying until you get it perfect, but adds more mercs and improves on UI features. It also includes multiplayer and a neat scenario editor I spent hours on as a teenager.With all the voice acting included, this is worth your time if you've never tried the originals or are into squad based tactics games in general."

,Recommended,283270,18918488,"Posted: 6 November, 2015",all,casial,"Jagged Alliance has been one of my most beloved game series for some twenty years now. But I feel most sentiment towards the oldest one, the original JA. Yes, the graphics looks ancient today. Its mechanics lacks a lot of things that were addressed in Deadly Games and later in JA2 and a few things can be quite frustrating. Yet I like it more than JA:DG - because it has story, more tactical choices and gives you much more freedom in the way how you'd like to make your way through the game.I guess it has very little potential to attract new generation of gamers and the only ones to purchase this game will be antediluvians such as myself, who have spent hundreds hours playing it  twenty years ago, but it is a pity, because only a handful of games are so memorable... and can be played over and over again and lose little of their appeal decades after their first release.JA:DG are much more straightforward, they add multiplayer (sort of), level and campaign editor, Mickey the weapons dealer with the most stereotypical Irish accent I've ever heard... Game mechanics are a wee bit more polished y'know, but the missions are in the order Gus Tarballs lays them for you, one per day and that's that... Don't get me wrong, it's not worse game than the original JA, in some ways it's better and I spent probably hundreds of hours playing it as well... Yer it lacks some charm of its predecessor, at least for me.TL;DR:If you're under thirty, don't buy it, you probably won't like it.If you're old enough to remember its first release and enjoyed it then, get it on sale, for 2,49€ it's a bargain and the game is still as much fun as it once was - and you get both JA and Deadly games.It runs in DOSBox, so it works even on Win10 and machines built in 21st century ;-)"

76561198083922786,Not Recommended,283270,19023588,"Posted: 11 November, 2015",all,slr,"I had a mixed feeling about rating this game good/bad.Its a classic DOS game from the 90s and it was very good at that time.Sadly the port to linux is simply letting it run in dosbox (simulating DOS), so it seems the developers did not put much time in it.For its normal price of E9,99 it is definitely not worth it, but with a discount of 75% I got it for E2,49, which is fine.It also has some bug issues:- when run for a long time.. the game update gets very slow, so you need to save the current state, quit and restart the game again.- Sometimes the path seek algorithm seems to hang, but the rest of the GUI does not. As workaround I load the previous saved state and continue from there again.The resolution seems to be just 320x200, but scaled a bit to something like 640x480 running with a black border on a 1900x1080 display. But I found that via a config file you can tell dosbox to use a 3xhq scale wich reduces the border and increases the details slightly.It is sad the developers did not put the effort of running it in a higher resolution. Now I am looking at a tiny overview of an area in which to move the soldiers, so I must move my view window all over the place to see what is going on. There is a full sector overview, in which each tile seems drawn in a 2x2 pixel, but then the details are gone.. so its hard to put your soldiers behind trees.About the game storyline and features.. it is really good.You hire a team of max 8 soldier and in a turn-based manner you scan an sector of the map for enemies and shoot them. When they are all dead, the sector is yours and you can put guards and workers (to get money) in and move on. With more money you can hire better soldiers and you can find weapons/items in each sector, which helps you to get the next sector.This sounds simple enough.. but the game has some nasty events thrown back at you to make it very hard to accomplish your tasks:-  The soldiers often miss their target (even a high skilled 91% sharp shooter),  the enemy however seem to miss rarely.. so I try to move my soldiers as close as possible to the enemy to get a higher chance of a hit. The enemy however can shoot you from a great distance (even ofscreen) and hit you.- The trees/bushes should provide a cover so the enemy can not hit you (and you can not hit them). However sometimes the bullet can get through and still hit.. so you are never sure if the cover really works.. it seems random.- So often your soldiers get wounded and need a medic to stop bleeding, but even when healed they will perform badly for that day.- They can only heal/rest fully when not used for a day, but then you have less soldiers that day to accomplish your task.- You can fire them and hire new ones, but new soldiers notice this and might not follow you or ask for double pay. Soldiers might hate eachother or leave you.- Booby traps over the map can kill you.. even though for a 97% explosion expert.- While your busy in one sector the enemy (3 soldiers) can take over another sector and kill 8 guards (the max possible) and this in easy mode!- Your weapons can be jammed when you try to fire.. costing your ""action points"" and making it useless for a next time.. so now I bring atleast two guns for each highly skilled soldier.- You might try to start with better skilled (but expensive) soldiers, but then you run out of money quickly.. I myself choose the cheapest best mark (good shooters), two cheap medics and a repair guy (to open locked doors and repair items) and one very good shooter (Ivan marks=91%).During gameplay I replace the cheaper ones with better ones.. but this can not be done often- I suggest reading the manual carefully as a lot of features were not clear to me from what the GUI shows:- the medic can become a doctor.. but it must have a medic box in its hand to do so.- the repair man can repair items at the base (must hold toolbox).. but can not repair items when on duty,  so it seems useless to let him bring the toolbox every mission.- you might find items that seem useless (eg oil, cloth, glass, fuelcan), but when you place one item in the main hand and place another in the extra slot below it, it might merge to a new item.- the soldiers you hire have their own skillset, but some of the soldiers seem to have an useless skillset or another with the same skillset is cheaper.. so why are they in the game.. just to confuse you?Above makes the game interesting and I was surprised how much effort was done in a game of the 90s. A lot of voice acting has been done for each certain event a soldier might experience, which is nice and funny.However for me it is also frustrating.. all events together are just too random and I keep on saving and loading to be able to continue, hoping that each time the situation differs a bit.But saving during the ""day"" gameplay has just one slot.. so if you make a mistake and save it and want to redo it, you need to redo the entire day. Oh.. and they made an option that you can play without the save option, but that seems for hardcore players only.You have another save possibilty for multiple slots in the main menu of the game, but this can only be used after a ""day"" is finished.You can play the game in easy/normal/hard mode and on youtube I see players play this on hard.I myself have trouble enough just playing it on easy mode.. :(So my conclusion is a ""No"":I feel the game reacts too much random.. making it hard/impossible to predict the outcome of each action. It is difficult enough already just to spend the ""action points"" wisely and create a strategy,but now the gameplay is merely following the steps:1. save current state2. try something3. if failed, reload and goto step 24. if really sure current state has a new advantage, goto step 15. goto 2At that rate it takes a long time to finish the game.. but it is not much fun."
