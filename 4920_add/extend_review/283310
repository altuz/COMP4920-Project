I finished this game years ago, but I'm really looking forward to completing it again.  FYI, the first time I played it I actually broke the game.  The  final boss is supposed to have it's health reduced to 25% and then runs to the last room, however I amped up my character so high that it killed the boss on the first meeting.  When I ran to the second room there was nothing to do, no end movie or credits.  I searched the web and figured out what I did and LAUGHED!!!!  I ended up reloading an earlier save and taking it easier on the bad guy and was able to finish the game.  I'm so looking forward to playing this again!"

This game is pretty fun, the lore and the world feels gothic and pretty much dead at some parts, it has a heavy gloomy felling all over it, and it is good.But there's an issue here with this partiucular version, since Infogrames closed and its IPs are scattered around different companies, no devs have appeared to patch this game.It is technically unplayable on this given moment on my Windows 7 64 bit computer, I can't find a healthy way to fix the fps, the screen ratio, the sound and the unsurmountable amount of crashes, I wanted to play it and to feel this game again, but too bad that it is unplayable right now. A fanpatch won't come soon enough since this game is pretty underground and doesn't have a big old fanbase, probably most of the people that enjoyed it back then have now forgotten it.For the moment, all that I can say is:The game is good, it's fun, has some fun mechanics and good physics interactions for the time, the lore is extense, the world is vast with much to explore, the voice actors are pretty fine too. But...Don't buy it if you don't own a old computer, you'll only be able to play it on older computers with Windows XP or earlier, or else, the uncompatibility issues will hit you hard."

I can run it on Windows 8.1, with the installer that actually lets you run it just adjust the Video and Graphics settings till it works. Used to play this game so much back in the day, finally being able to play it again is such a joy!"

BUt when it came out on steam i found that there where nore than a few bug that where not in the orignal game. Like the combat, there are many occasions where my opponet and i will just sit there and stare at each other (with the exception of spiders, but then agein they where always a nuicence). Also they nerfed the mace which was an AWSOME early game wepoin. the also took out afew items, like at jakes farm, just when you enter the farm the is a plot of farm land that once held about 24 herbs in the origanal version of soulbringer. that being said i havnt played through the whole game yet due to the combat bug. Heres to hopeing they will fix it (and also PLZ beef up scorn if i remember correctly in the original version scorn (the final boss) was pretty wimpy when you got to him!)all that being said it is still an AWSOME retro game and i would recomend it to anyone!"

Unnamed stranger, who will change the world and save it from oncoming evil. League of Six together again, and only I can stop them.""Soulbringer"" is a game of a dawn of CRPG, when there were no established formulas and forms. From the age of experiments. Therefore, it is unusual everything: combat system, design and, of course, plot and style. You won't find anything similar in any games in those years, nor modern.Now we can say about ""Soulbringer"" that it is a poor graphics, strange and difficult combat system and frequent crashes. But 15 years ago this game was magical. I remember my wandering through the snowy fields near Madrigal and Shadowguard. And as I touched the magical stone in first time.Now you don't understand the whole awesomeness of this game, but if you played it in 2000th - you're lucky one.10 nostalgic nerds from 10"
,Recommended,283310,20347228,"Posted: 6 January, 2016",all,RedKingBadger,An old favorite from long ago.  Compared to the similar games today it may seem slow but with patience this can be a rewarding game.  The music and voice acting is very unique and adds to the overall atmosphere a lot.  It can be difficult at times to find locations but back in the day that was the norm.  I suggest to the older PC gamers who aren't afraid to show a little patience and understanding to this genre of game before they were super refined.
,Recommended,283310,11593140,"Posted: 7 August, 2014",all,artman225,"This was the game that made me fall in love with RPGs. I played it endlessly back in middle school, and replay it every few years for nostalgia's sake. The story is compelling and every NPC having its own voice actor really bring the game to life. The music is great and always appropriate for whatever situation you find yourself in.It has this creepy, gothic feel to it that sufficiently terrified me when I first played it.The graphics are exactly what you'd expect from a 2000 game, but I do like that you can rotate the camera freely. Picking up items can be a pain, but the main complaint I have is how it's clearly unfinished - something that becomes clearer and clearer as you delve further into the game.In my opinion, had this game been completed, it would have rivaled Baldur's Gate or Torment (which it was packaged with)."

Nevertheless, there are several mechanics that were pretty unique. There're plenty spells to learn and many are quite nice.   Combat is... interesting... Efficient way to fight, but not the most easy way to solve it, but guess by the time the game was released the whole techy stuff was just fine.The story is good, a little hard to follow, but good enough.Now, I do recommend the game, but I must suggest it for very patient, hardcore retro-gamers. This game absolutely challenge your will. Run and run, round and round, back and forward, get lost and struggle to find your way... over and over again. The game doesn't hold your hand, many times you are left wondering: what did I miss this time? Why this thing is not working? Then you do realize you indeed missed something long ago or the stuff will work but much later. Yup, likely you gonna need to use a guide several times.About bugs, not many but some. The music never worked right for me. One or two times the game was irresponsive, not a big deal unless you forgot to save and remember: save very often. You die at any time and you won't even see it coming.All in all, there are plenty things to do, several locations, many dialogs (mixed voice acting, some good actors, some rather pathetic), unique features and, well, art and grapics are sooo old that is kinda charming in a way. Entertaining but frustraiting."

I have had so much fun playing this.When i bought this on Steam it would NOT launch. For me the fix was go to the launch exe ...\Steam\steamapps\common\Soulbringer\Soulbringer.exe, Go Properties/Compatibility and Run it in compatibility mode for Windows 98/ME. Tick ""Disable display Scaling on high DPI settings"" and of course ""Run as Administrator"".- Not all of these may be required, though once i did that, the game brings up the config menu prior to launch - where you can set your resolution etc.Im running AMD FX-8350 / ATI 7900 GFX - Windows 7 64bit.***May not work for everyone."

Make sure that you have the software enabled as graphics on newer machines. The magic system is interesting, where balance can be essential. I wasn't able to finish 12+ years ago since the software would lock-up. This time around I will be a little more cautious near the end. If you can pick this title up on sale for $2.50, I would recommend. I think that Dubbya would agree.....TWO HORNS."

The athmosphere, unique combat and magic system just made me go back to it again and again so this was a game I replayed every 4-5 years. When I got to windows 10 I dreaded the fact that I couldn't replay this old classic, but thanks to steam I got to relive this experience."

For a long time I could not remember what it was called until i stumbled across it on Steam. I was over-joyed so i bought it. noting that it was old but it seems to meet the compatibility reqs. Not true. I have a Win7 x64 using a  Radeon 5770 and this game will not run even with drivers rolled back to 12.10.  Buyer beware that this game may not run for you even if reqs are met.got it to work. awesome game if you can get passed the date of it and the  incredibley unforgiving nature of it. hint: run loops of the same swing at first to figure out how the enemy moves and you move. then throw some combos in there once you get the hang of it.
