76561198023023915,Not Recommended,283350,15052749,"Posted: 25 March, 2015",all,hagakuremoi,"It is not so bad, but I can't recommend it.The campaign mechanics is very interesting, you control a group of 6 pilots in Iceland during a Russian Invasion (Tom Clancy Style), you can choose a pilot to control and you can change to other pilot at any moment, this is useful because there are simultaneous missions, this can be overwhelming at first but is simple.The campaign is huge apparently, I played more than 5 hours and I cant see the end of this, the campaign is in real time starting a 8:30 hrs on day 1. and you can speed up the time 10x, I have played the equivalent to 16 hours in game time.The graphics remembered me Ace Combat 3 Electrosphere. The gameplay is a little complicated in my opinion even after reading the manual, the success rate of the guided missiles is low even against non-moving targets, is possible to control the fighter with the mouse but I think this is too unconvenient in the dogfight, in addition you dont have ruddle control.It works perfectly on windows 8.1 64xIn conclusion, a very interesting concept but not a very functional implementation."

76561198064388679,Recommended,283350,28929247,Posted: 1 January,all,ZenZone1,"Game works with some extra work. Here is the demo:https://youtu.be/OVXrhYXjSSQLooks pretty good to me.Here is the 2nd part of the first tutorial with landing:https://youtu.be/p4WWYCLpFAsWhat you need to do is:1) Double-click the reg file from the game folder (must)2) Run config3dr2000.exe (optional)3) Right-click on the game in library list and select create a shortcut to your desktop4) Run from the shortcut (must)Note about shortcuts: If you use shortcut created by Steam, it runs is Windows 98 compatibility mode. If you make your own shortcut, you can set to any compatibility mode but you need to make sure you have admin rights and take ownership of the folder first. Steam shortcut tracks your game time but your own shortcut can be set to Windows 2000 mode or higher and runs better without Steam.Offline mode is problematic. You need to run the game twice without exiting the first one. The first one will be dormant in memory but clicking the shorcut again will run the game. When online you only need to click once.Now on to more pertinent points about the game itself. Dynamic campaign runs in real-time on it's own time not on demand but you can speed-up, slowdown or pause. Missions are generated on the fly depending on who you choose as your squadmates. For example if you chose more Air-to-Air specialists then your missions will be more about dogfights rather than bombing missions. That's what the manual says anyway, haven't played enough to verify though. You can switch between pilots or let the AI do the job while you watch as spectator, this is true.I haven't played much but i think this should be good because you can give orders to your wingmen and you can switch over to flying as them much like in Air Conflicts: Vietnam. Only thing that seems to be lacking are rudder controls and countermeasures. Landing is a bit difficult without rudder control though still doable. I landed on the first attempt and pass. Mouse flight doesn't seem to work. Keyboard control is a little rough but usable.Finally there is a tutorial, so no excuse to not knowing how to fly.Definitely worth it at 90% off. This is a gem. I suppose gems come as a rough rock at first then you need to cut and polish it to a shine."
,Recommended,283350,29299237,Posted: 16 January,all,pete_agreatguy,"Thanks to ZenZone1 for on how to get this to work (works fine on Win 7 x64):See his review on how to get the gamne working! I highly recommend getting steam to create the shortcut on your desktop!A lot of users are asking for the manual so I have uploaded these to my google drive (including a strategy guide). You can find them here:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1w7Tm1SmIHvZ1ZqUXJHVkxNdTA?usp=sharingIt's a great game. Very complex. The model aircraft and how it handles are stunning, and the sounds in game are excellent for when this game was initially developed. I love the external camera view and you can defiantly here the dopler effect. I love how you can watch your enemies die by following your missiles to their target. You can provide commands to your wingman and assign them a target whilst you concentrate on another. You can even communicate with the air bases located around the map.Easy to configure your plane for each mission. Dog fights are really good fun, though hard in places. I highly recommend viewing the manual and strategy guide included in the above link. They will help considerably as the tutorial via the peace game mode doesn't have details on how to fly the aircraft, let alone how to operate it's complex systems on board. Another useful tip, use the autopilot, it is there for a reason!Overall, a great game for its time. Even now I still enjoy this. Highly recommended; especially if you haven't played this before. I can see myself playing a lot of hours on this again (regardless of what steam says as the game won't run via steam play button, it will only run via the shortcut)."

No heads-down displays, inferior UI - it's basically an arcade version of that game. If you're looking for EF2000, keep looking because you will be disappointed by this game."

I bought this game in hopes that a family member and I may play it together, that is NOT going to happen.  I can not even get the game to actually start playing.  The install errored, and after trying four times the game started up but in a small 800x600 (maybe) window.  the opening screen, a Typhoon jet flying at differing camera views, will NOT stop playing.  I am unsable to start an actual game and control the airplane.  Also, the graphics are on par with a Win98 game.If you can buy this at 80% off  ~and~  you feel like trying to troublshoot the issues, give it a go.  It ""might""  be some fun."
,Recommended,283350,17850467,"Posted: 2 September, 2015",all,Ferdinand Griffon,"It is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get it working properly at full resolution, but once you do it is good game, and I think that modern developers looking into doing or updating sims like this should look at it because there are very good ideas.As for the simulation part, when it comes to flying this is not a DCS, not even an FSX. The flight model is not hardcore, but for the time it came out it is very decent, and you get G visual and sound effects.The only thing wrong with the game is that you have to edit a file and run it to get a proper resolution, because the config tool doesn't work. And also some people have reported problems when trying to run it, like the game not loading. Also a manual would be nice, but with a bit of trial and error you will get to know the keys and what do the markers mean, etc...Normally I would give this a negative review because all the problems we get in this version, and because the publishers/devs/people who brought it to steam don't seem to care enough, and haven't solved this problems yet... But as there are enough negative reviews my positive review goes for the actual game when you got it running"

Tried getting in touch with Support, no help so far (Would be happy to change my review once this gets fixed) Love this game and wish there was something like it, just can't play it anymore thanks to the game crashing.*Update* Got in contact with someone directly. Downloaded DRM version and works fine. Probably an error due to not being able to launch from steam and having to edit the registry for the game. Hoping a fix comes along in the future for other to enjoy this awesome but very old game."
