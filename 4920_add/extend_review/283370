Rogers [DFS],"Deeply broken game from 2000s, it starts off as a wonderful concept, but overall....The bots are horribly low programmed, and pathed, the stealth system behaves very irregularly, and worst of all.Mouses are oversensative in the game, making it feel like a cheesey console knock off.It even does'nt seem to be mostly in a jungle after I played the 2nd mission.However, I loved part of the song at the start of mission 1."

I really felt like the action was happening in my living room! No VR headset was on during this i have to add.As I was playing it, I managed to completely destroy some black people that were completely oblivious to my presence, which made it much, much easier. It really felt like i was killing people. I thought about their family as I imagined them dying. I have to visualize the kill before commiting to it, so that was a hard task. After playing this game, I did no longer feel like I had to shoot children to compensate my hate for humanity. This is the best 59p I have ever spend. Thank Myself for this beautiful piece of software engineering.Many game developers could learn a lesson or two from playing this game.I would recommend this game for anyone that feels like shooting up a school. Even an office. Or a small shop maybe?You could also go to the shop and support them by spending 59p on a chocolate bar. It will probably taste better.TL;DR: Don't buy this. It is trash. Try it though. It's actually really bad."

It is not a game for realism it is a shooter and a stealth game. I gets exspecialy good when you first get into the desert. It is an old game that has aged well.

I've played Marine Sharpshooter on Xbox 360 and its graphics were enough to enjoy. The graphics in this game makes me feel like I am back playing on the original xbox. Such a waste of money for a p!ssy game.

,Not Recommended,283370,24342845,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,Firefox,"This title is one of astounding achievements to grace the Earth, and clearly, the developers were inspired by some sort of divine intervention because there is no other plausible explanation for this masterpiece. The beginning starts out slow but it gets rapidly better as the game moves on.The story is simply amazing! Allow me to give you the rundown just so you can hear about it in case you don't buy!Meet Jack ""Rambo Stereotypical American Bad Voice Acting Soldier Guy with big gun"" Bauer, a Russian-American Sniper Elite originally trained by America's Delta Force and the Navy Seals, and while he was going to join with Delta Force as one of its most elite marksman, the joint chiefs saw a brighter future than even so for him. And so the joint chiefs created an entirely seperate unit for Bauer and another elite soldier, Sergeant Jack Daniels Cooper, someone so well trained and rehearsed in the art of marksmanship that he can't actually hit anything! In fact he is so powerful and elite that he weakens the 7.62 rounds he fires out of his M14 to the strength equivalent of tossing dog excretions at a M1 Abrams battle tank! Together, he and Jack Bauer journey to the jungle of Africa where they attempt to rescue the President of Africa! Now, on their mission to save the president of Africa, they must remain unseen ghosts in the night or they will be destroyed...but then they realised that their enemies couldn't hit ♥♥♥♥ and proceeded to terminate half the population of Africa under the ROE. Eventually after killing every else blah blah blah, some German Mecenaries etc. etc. etc. bang bang pew Murica n' stuff idk pow pow.... they finally rescued the president of Africa! But then realised that they murdered 90% of Africa and seemed to have not followed the ROE to any extent. Oh, and also Sgt. Cooper and Jack Bauer had their retinas explode due the amazing -4k graphic fidelity of the game they were in. Oh, and Cooper also was reincarnated 1,000,000,000,000 times after being riddle with approximately 999,999,999,999,999 AK-47 rounds after refusing to open fire 1,000,001032914239818092748013784912 times after being named as the slowest man in the world. So slow that his and every other enemy's legs move faster than they are actually going. Um......something something MURICA.....uhhhh...I'm thinking....ohhhh...I forgot -also the world explodes and they fall into an alternate universe where they become Space Marine Sharpshooter {repeat Story with sci-fi details} um...also empenadas!  Seriously....don't buy this game...it's not worth 99 cents....its not worth the braincells you expend to play it....-10/10 would spotter againDid I mension how many African rebels you kill on your way...literally over four hundred...there is no stealth factor at all unless you mean those braindead AI who stare at you for 5 seconds before processing you going to kill them."
,Not Recommended,283370,24342961,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,TailZ,"I've played Marine Sharpshooter 1, 2, and 3 (not 4 because i didnt even know it existed until 2 years ago) and i've gotta say, out of all 3 i like this one the most. No, its not a good game and i wouldnt recommend you buy this unless its on sale like it is as im writing this review, the AI is terrible, they run at you and sometimes completely ignore you, they are also very inaccurate. the one thing they improved on from the first game was the spotter, in the original game the spotter is about as bad as your enemies, he even gets in front of your scope sometimes as you pull the trigger causing you to kill him and fail the mission, but they fixed that in this game which is a plus i guess. All in all its fun but only if you play it in small sessions and if you can get pass some of the games faults."
