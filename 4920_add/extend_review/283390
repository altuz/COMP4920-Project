,Recommended,283390,9367625,"Posted: 6 March, 2014",all,Davido01,An arcade space shooter which is a pure classic. Comes along with the original Incoming too which is equally good. Gameplay is very fun and easy to get into. =)

It was an amazing game at the time when it came out and was lots of fun. You play as a human soldier defending Earth from aliens. However it aged pretty badly, not only in the graphics sector but in OS compatibility. While I was able to run the game I always had some upper bar or other obstruction over the top of the game screen. On top of that the controls are terribly clunky especially with mouse so just go full keyboard control instead. So perhaps try it out but move on to the much better sequel Incoming Forces where this time you are in control of an alien pilot. The story is not complex but somewhat cute and quite enjoyable. The range of vehicles expands, you get to control turrets, tanks, artillery and a range of air fighters. Missions are replayable separately and have a High Score system. The transition between vehicles is really smooth and controls are great. The graphics are a bit clunky but that does not matter in this case. However only 16 (mostly short) missions is not that much. Overall a fun shooter with a big range of vehicles and nice (although cheesy) story. Recommended.------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review you can find more on theCurator pageor in myReview Corner."

There is nothing much else to say other than if you like arcade shooters and you don't mind the one minute process of fixing up the original Incoming with dgVoodoo2 (makes it compatible with Windows 7, 8, and 8.1!) you should get this."
,Recommended,283390,10173067,"Posted: 19 May, 2014",all,Oreyon,"Now this game, I only bought it for the original Incoming as many others did as well, so I will review the first game as i didn't bother to play much into Forces.Short review: Just get it if you like fast paced Arcade Shooters with an okay story.Long review: The game itself is a pretty straight forward Attack/Defense game where you can control various air and ground vehicles, and sometimes also can control several units in a strategy minigame in the story. While the Arcade mode is what the name says, just flying around with an airplane and collecting points. Imagine the game being 'Alien Invaders' with 3D graphics and more variation on vehicles to choose from. The story btw is nothing which will blow you away, just the generic 'Aliens invade Earth' story, but the way the gameplay works here, i recommend a gamepad, best experience, and your triggers won't work if you play with xbox pad, but other than that you don't need much buttons anyways."

It does run in the background until you manually close it out through task manager. This game has lots of nostalgia attached to it, but I cannot recommend a game that does not work and steam will not let me get a refund for it."

The mouse won't go to the maximize icon in the upper right etc.. Incoming Forces doesn't launch at all, not even when I go to the folder and launch the app manually (as administrator or otherwise). Also the orginal incoming is not compatible with a controller unless you get a program to map it. The orginal is fun with a controller, and I'll probably never know how bad the second one is. Good luck."

Its a good classic shooter for its time where as you've got 3 types of vehicles to choose from, with the slight repetive missions it seems like the best Classic Shooter for its time. Honestly I thought we were going to play an FPS as a soldier but I guess I kinda read ""Ground Forces"" wrong but hey, it still seemed Ok. Now I'm not recommending it because most people would find it repetitive and ongoing with the same thing over and over again as well with the massive jumps in diffilculty that is just insane, Easy is too easy but Medium changes everything to the point where it would be hard and hard would be insaner so its really hard to get what you enjoy. But if your into Classic shooters, I'm all for it!"

It is like the original Incoming, but somewhat worse, despite better graphics, and humans are now your enemies. Not bad by all means for what it is, but not as fun as the original Incoming, especially when it was new."

The game works fine on windows 7, no major or minor bugs yet. Just don't alt tab seems that breaks something in the coding.Its still the good old game it was.

,Recommended,283390,19556710,"Posted: 7 December, 2015",all,ytayj,"OK I'm gonna ignore the godawful sequel that is somehow mandatorily tacked on (and really shouldn't be the main attraction) and review Incoming, the original game, which alone is well worth the £7.Classic arcade flight/combat game for PC (then Dreamcast, THEN arcade systems funnily enough). It looks great for its time and it is still satisfying as hell to play. In arcade mode, pick a plane/heli/ship of your choice and blow other ships up for as long as it takes them to blow you up. Periodically upgrades get dropped for you to collect, so depending on how good you are, arcade runs can go for a surprisingly long time.What really stands out, however, is the campaign mode. It's maybe a little repetitive but the various scenarios you're placed in get challenging, like defending a runway from an onslaught of bombers. Story-wise, it's a game of its time. It features just about EVERY 90s alien movie trope imaginable:Arctic-based invaders with no clearly-defined motive ✓Man comes together around the world to get rid of the evil aliens ✓Hilariously incapable military equipment somehow beats back well-equipped aliens through sheer will (and lasers) ✓A sudden horrifying realisation that the scale of the problem is worse than first thought ✓Humans go get revenge on aliens for no clearly-defined reason ✓There's also a tactics mode but I've barely touched it since I'm not a strategy kind of guy. Sure it's fun though.There's a fairly decent variety of maps, most of which are set on Earth but a couple are extra-terrestrial, and a LOT of craft to choose from. There's a good few attack helicopters, several real American fighters and bombers, a Russian MiG, and some pretty imaginative spacecraft drawing from both 50s and 90s alien motifs. Oh, andthe humans get cool spaceships of their own further down the line.I first played this as a kid as part of a huge software bundle that came with the family PC, and I was hooked. I've since bought it on both here and GOG, just out of nostalgia and respect. I have no idea why the game doesn't have the recognition it deserves. It's classic. GO BUY IT.P.S.: numberonedacrestreet ;)"
76561198013224583,Recommended,283390,22387265,"Posted: 12 April, 2016",all,Just an Oryaw,"INCOMING REVIEWER!Ah yes, the Incoming series. Awful shame it had to die off so long ago. The original Incoming was one of the first PC games I ever played, utilizing a Real3D StarFighter graphics card, and a whopping 400MB of RAM! I had fond memories about this game; how graphically impresive it was for the late 90's. But two questions remain; Does the Incoming bundle hold up today, and is it worth buying? The short answer for these questions is Yes and No, so please allow me to explain.It's safe to say that Incoming and Incoming Forces do not hold up by their own selves today. With our PC's always upgrading with maximum stats, combined with how old these games are, it should come to no surprise that the games are heavily outdated, and poorly optimized. In the original Incoming, I found many of the models to be incorrectly rendered, enabling you to see through them. I am also aware that Incoming cannot be correctly played on Windows 8.1 and 10 machines, so unless you have Windows 7 at latest, you may want to pass this game; you're not missing much.On the other hand, Incoming Forces is a much more optimized piece of software, but is not really a ""great"" game per-se. In retrospect, the plot is silly, and for a 2002 game, I've seen much better-looking games. Gameplay is also a bit lackluster, so I would recommend the consumer to purchase the product mainly for the original Incoming; Incoming Forces feels like an unnecessary pack-in, so I'd consider it as a form of bonus game.Now, is this product worth buying? For me, it was a simple ""yes,"" because I obtained it during a sale. I had fond memories of this game, and I wanted to return to see what I was missing all these years. As for the average consumer, I would recommend this game only if they are a hardcore fan of vehicular combat, combined with space-like arcade railshooting. If you are into that ""futuristic"" techno vibe, look no further than the original Incoming's soundtrack. While small, the songs are rather catchy, and the game is definitely worth playing to at least hear these songs.All in all, Incoming and Incoming Forces isnt too bad of a product to invest in. I feel that the price may be a bit much for these rather obscure titles, but hey, you're getting a dual-pack that was originally valued along the lines of $40 dollars in the day. It's ultimately your choice whether or not you want these games.Ratings:Incoming: 7/10Incoming Forces: 5/10"
