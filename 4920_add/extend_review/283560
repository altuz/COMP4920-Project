Haven't tested this new patch, will edit after I can confirm that the game works.""The Copilot is no longer crashing the game to the desktop, Excellent.  Features appear to be actually working now without crashing the game. I stand by my opinion of the grapics of the game they are just plain bad,   there is no english language verbal sounds in the game unlike what it says in the description above, First person control is awkward the W,A,S,D  .. a  and d dont strafe they turn you very odd.  At max graphics and Resolution 1920x1080 the textures are ugly with a very strange grainy layered look. However if you are interested in Running a single bus route for the price its just not worth it.. if it was half the price.. 5 buck software is what I would put it at."

,Recommended,283560,21969474,"Posted: 21 March, 2016",all,DeanGeddes,"To begin, I would like to disagree with most of the other reviews, because this is a very good game. It is a massive improvement to Bus Simulator 2012, by the same developers. I do agree that the format is a bit strange, but it just takes a bit of getting used to. The graphics are of a very good quality, especially the weather effects and I usually get good FPS as well. Please be aware before you purchase, that this is quite a graphically demanding game and you will require a high end system. Let's begin with what makes this game really enjoyable:- The bus is very detailed inside, with nice textures and all of the switches and buttons are clickable, unlike other bus simulators out there.- There are lots of really cool view modes all around the drivers seat, and I love the way the camera zooms in and out on the panels.- Nice effects such as cab sway.- The co-pilot is very useful and you can use to alter settings such as announcements and routes.- There are about three different buses you can choose from, so a nice selection.- The AI passengers are quite realistic and they can knock on the window of the bus if you leave then behind.- Lots of traffic to enhace the realism! I have been waiting for this in a bus game for quite some time.- Weather effects are incredibly realistic, with beautiful cloud and sunlight textures.- There are also special effects such as trams and bus diversions.- You are informed about events such as diversions, or shift duties, via the radio.- You can be put on rail replacement bus routes.- Extreme events can occur. For example, a car accident and you may have to take a diversion.- Like most TML games, you can free roam the city and walk around inside your bus.- There is a tutorial, which is very handy. You can turn it off in settings. However, it is written at the top of the screen, so doesn't offer any voice guidance.Now let's mention the improvements that could have been made and some of the issues:- It's a shame that there's only one bus route in the game, with an extra little run to the depot. It would have been nice to have some more variation.- Upon launching the game for the first game, I was baffled by a white screen with three small colours to click on. It took me about 10 minutes to realise I had to double click on a green dot, in order to load up the main menu! What was the point in that?- Sometimes, I find the game a little bit too German. Things such as the radio, is only available in German, with English subtitles at the top of the screen. It would have been handy to have an English voice as well.- Some people may see this as a positive, but there is no cash involved in the game. Now it is much quicker to board passengers onto the bus as they just walk straight on. I used to like printing tickets and giving change, but that's just my opinon. Your choice, which do you prefer?- The menus in the game are very perculiar. They are complex to understand and some of the text is in very small font.-Some of the AI passengers can act very weird at times, for example walking round in circles and I have even seen a couple of people fly up into the air.-A very minor flaw. When you are sitting in the drivers seat, you cannot see the icons on the dashboard as the steering view obsures them. So when someone presses the stop button, you can hear the beep, but not see the icon come on the dashboard. So you have to press NUM 8 to zoom in on the dashboard to check if it was pressed (whilst still trying to drive).Although this is overall a very good game, I would say that the price may be a little expensive, so I'm glad that I bought it in a sale. It is one of the best bus simulators out there for PC, as well as being by far the most realistic. It does have some flaws, as just mentioned, but they are nothing too serious. So in conclusion, I do recommend this game for any simulation enthusiasts, like myself, as it provides an extremely good simulation of being a bus driver in Munich.Personally, I would wait for a sale before buying it."

,Not Recommended,283560,24952641,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,Gorbon5,"Just to be clear, my negative rating for this game comes from the perspective of someone playing using keyboard controls. I have a wheel/pedals, but this game didn't seem to work with them (I use a Thrustmaster Ferrari GT Experience wheel), so I only have experience of this game as played with a keyboard. I would say if you have a recent and reliable wheel then ignore my review and give this game a go if it's on sale.The graphics in this simulator are, in my opinion, pretty good. They won't blow you away, but they're probably the best out of all the bus simulators I've tried - I particularly like the buildings that line the streets, but maybe that's because I'm used to OMSI. The bus modelling is also pretty good, and there's a good variety of AI traffic types (there's even the odd tram).However, my main gripe with this game is that its keyboard controls are pretty dire. (Again, if you play with a wheel then this game's probably pretty good, but as mentioned I couldn't get mine to work.) You get two options: 'normal', ie standard arcade-style steering where whenever you're not touching the left/right buttons the steering defaults to the centre as fast as possible, and 'alternative', which is more OMSI-ish in that the position of the wheel holds when you let go of the button (I much prefer this steering style). Unfortunately, this 'alternative' mode doesn't work well at all, as you must keep tapping the left/right button to increase/decrease the steer - it responds only to the velocity of your press, not how long you hold it for like in OMSI. This makes steering very difficult whichever mode you choose, as one keeps resetting itself and the other requires you to be very good at tapping at high frequencies and being able to modulate your finger (which I am not and I don't think most humans are).This sim features dynamic roadworks and accidents, which I think are pretty awesome and work quite well. I encountered both an accident and roadworks during the hour I spent in-game (before I got too frustrated with the steering). Roadworks mean you have to divert, and signs go up around a diversionary route, which I imagine adds something fresh to an otherwise fairly monotonous simulation (there are only a couple of routes to drive, though they are a reasonable length). I did find, however, that AI traffic completely ignored the roadworks, and drove straight through all the bollards and barriers in the road.AI traffic is another gripe I have with this simulator, and is something that I find annoying about OMSI, too. Cars will pull out in front of you at will, though I haven't noticed collisions causing actual damage (just a smashing sound) or upsetting passengers - though I have only had a couple of AI collisions. Most of my collisions are with lamp posts while trying to turn the bus. I haven't had any issues with pedestrians, though people waiting at bus stops will approach my bus and stand completely still, then when I close my doors they'll come over and knock on them. This is more a minor irritation than a major problem.This is a German game with a lot of German stuff - the buses are German and the radio transmissions are in German - but everything you need to care about is subtitled in English, and the menus are available in English too, so as long as you know either language you'll be fine. However, the UI itself is pretty annoying; the devs have tried to make the menus into a 'control centre', meaning lots of animations and fancy buttons, but many of the UI elements are quite small and the animations take a while to complete, leading to a slow and clunky user experience. Pausing the game with ESC takes you to the menu screen (though pressing ESC again takes you back into the game) which is fine, except that there is a very slow fade transition between the two which just gets annoying every time you instinctively press ESC to exit things like the map. There's no HUD in-game (with the exception of a map), which is a positive thing since this is meant to be a proper simulation, and you get all of your information such as the time, temperatures etc. from the dashboard, your 'co-pilot' machine or the tachograph. I think this is pretty cool, though a minor annoyance is that some dash icons such as the stop request indicator are hidden by the steering wheel when in normal driving view, and the views can't be adjusted (as far as I know). You can see these icons by going into the dashboard view using numpad 8.It should probably be noted that a lot of the controls are focussed on the numpad by default in this sim, as per OMSI.The routes in this sim have timetables and AI buses which stick to them, but I find the lack of a time skipping feature annoying as the routes appear to be relatively infrequent, and on one occasion it expected me to sit at a particular bus stop for 30 mins. I also dislike the zoom level of the HUD map, as it doesn't give much warning of junctions and thus advance lane selection is difficult. Additionally, I don't like that in order to use the mirrors you have to hold buttons to get specific mirror views (you can't just glance at them as you can in OMSI), as it makes using them while driving quite difficult since you've already got one hand reserved for steering and one reserved for looking around with the mouse.I found everything ran smoothly with decent FPS on high settings - my specs are an i5-3570K (standard clock speed), 16GB of RAM (though I doubt it used all of that) and an AMD R9 270X. If you're on a lower specced PC than this you'll probably still have no problems running the game, but you may need to turn some graphical features off such as high detail mirror reflections.So, overall, this simulator is actually pretty good, and certainly seems fairly accurate. You can press all the buttons and things in the cab which is really nice, and the sounds are decent too, so I can tell the dev team have put a lot of effort in. However, my experience was marred by the poorly done keyboard control system, as well as a build up of 'minor annoyances' which led to me reaching the end of a route and getting so frustrated with the game that I am unlikely to play it again. Maybe I'm just a bad driver, but I don't have this issue with other simulators (at least, ones that don't have this steering system). I have mentioned OMSI quite a lot in this review, but I didn't come here expecting this to be OMSI but with nicer graphics; it's just that there are some aspects of bus simulation that OMSI just does right, and this sim just doesn't.Again, if you have a wheel and you reckon it'll work, then this simulator *is* worth a try, but I would only get it if it's on sale."
