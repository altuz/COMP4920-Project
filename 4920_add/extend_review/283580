,Not Recommended,283580,14137432,"Posted: 23 January, 2015",all,fútbolwombat,"UPDATE: I have gotten the game to work, and it is still a waste of $10.With the Missions, you get told what to do at the beginning but if you forget then you can't ask what to do again.With the Campaign, I am currently on Chapter 6 and it has an unskippable five minute TV show at the beginning. This is really drawing me away from playing this game because I have to sit there for five minutes waiting for the game to actually start.My Logitech G27 is barely compatible with this game. If I move the wheel to the left in 5 seconds then it actually takes 10 seconds for the wheel in the game to move making it hard to drive. This is one of my only bus games where my steering wheel doesn't work.Overall, don't buy this game, it is such a waste. Buy OMSI 2 instead, it is a much better bus simulator.UPDATE 1/23/2016: I've been trying to play this game and it doesn't work anymore. When I try to play, the game crashes and takes me back to my desktop. This game is such a waste of money."

,Not Recommended,283580,21740369,"Posted: 9 March, 2016",all,Monterico Gaming TV,I found a game I can 100% say is a terrible simulator. BROKEN!!!! Do not buy. The Monte has warned you. From falling into the ground 2 minutes in to most of the controls not even being mapped is just plain BS. I have never seen such a piece of junk game in my life. I have tried a few times and about 5 minutes into a campaign I get stuck inside a bus that drove up on the sidewalk working to the garage one campaign mission 1. After these 2 stupid issues and the inability to skip scenes just WOW. Please Please Please do not by this trash. Good gaming and see you all around. I hope I saved a life today. :) Did I mention how bad this game is. First Thumbs down review from me.

I bought a new pc, thats where the story ends really.Why doesn't it work anymore?It simply does not. Installed quicktime, did a reboot but nothing. I hear a second when the music plays and then back to windows.Fixes?It worked before on my old pc, but doesn't anymore on my new one. Looked everywhere for a fix but no. Did find out that a lot of people have problems with this game anyway.My OS and graphics?I use Win7 Home Premium 64 bit and a Nvidia GTX 9-series graphicscard.Do I recommend it?No, I can not and will not recommend this game, try Bus Driver instead that one does work."

It's a total scam that will take forever to downlaoad, even if you have a beast computer. It also has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, terrible control schemes, and is overall trash.

I like it and all but can you give it an Detroit Diesel Series 50 Engine or a Detroit Diesel 6V92TA Engine? The C4 Just sounds little bit off task. (MAINLY GIVE IT AN 6V92TA Engine.
