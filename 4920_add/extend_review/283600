,Recommended,283600,13049323,"Posted: 22 November, 2014",all,casey_deterra,"Ok, so I got the game on my Windows 8 PC, and it worked well! If you like trains, or basically the Berlin Subway, like me, you have to buy this! I wonder to myself on how I ever first found Berliner Underground. That actually came from a suggested video on YouTube. Autistic exploration is required for maximum enjoyment of this game, just like me! It's a fair price for a generally modern game. Not sure if it works on Mac... It's really tough to learn how to control the trains when you start for your first time, but you get used to it later. For that, I would recommend watching World Of Subways Vol 2 videos before your actual gameplay. Plus, about the trailer - In the beggining, it seems like a ""scary"" game, like Portal 2 (another game). But then, it's a tiny bit more interesting. When you play, and see the damaged or strange looking parts of the train tunnels, or any other interesting parts, that can really spike your senses for the game. The textures are so detailed and basically, every texture is correct! Every texture is exactly the real thing! Like, you tecnically reinvented Berliner U-Bahn! I also recommend that you could make a timetable for a route from Rathaus Spandau to Jakob-Kaiser-Platz, maybe. Except, there's no terminus area for it! The terminus is only for trains bound for Rathaus Spandau at Jakob-Kaiser. You know what else I want you to add to the game? A mode where you can ride the trains all around the subway line! To ALMOST sum it up, without this software, I'd be the most bored person in the world! Thanks for German people!!! C4 Engine, TML Studios, Aerosoft, THANKS SO MUCH!!!!! You have opened my imagination to the maximum! Speaking of that, I imagine that I realistically have an F90 and H01 trains (the two types of rolling stock trains in this game) right in my front and back yards of my house, AND I drive them around the yard! THAT'S how EPICALLY HUGE you've made my imagination grow! I could describe it much more, but I honestly don't even know how, REALLY!!! Anyway, it gets to be real fun and you'll never stop playing! I RECOMMEND THIS GAME, DEFINITLY!!!!!"

The description of every cabin item, light, button is not easy to read.The option to not have the simulation end every time a red signal has been passed."
76561198159426714,Recommended,283600,15054402,"Posted: 25 March, 2015",all,nzyowie,"This is a decent little railway simulation on the whole, but it pays to read the manual first! Unlike later World of Subways editions, this one provides no in-game help, and half the necessary keys aren't even configured! So the game can be a frustrating experience when you first start it. World of Subways 3 by contrast gives you a much better introduction with an in-game tutorial that takes you through the basics, and the new WOS 4 has a pretty thorough introductory tutorial as well. This game could have really used something like that. But if, like me, you're a first-time user, do take some time to read the manual, especially the sections on driving the trains and which keys do what, and configure the keys as well before starting in earnest.Moving on to the actual gameplay: you get to choose from two different trains: an older F90 and a newer H01. Of the two, I found the H01 much easier to drive. It's much more straightforward to regulate the maximum speed with the push of a button than fiddling with a lever as you have to do with the F90. The F90 just seems to require one or two extra steps in getting started and stopping as well. Of course, if you like more of a challenge, by all means pick the F90, but otherwise the H01 is more user-friendly for me.Graphics are great and performance is excellent. I have not experienced any major problems with this game in terms of lagging, crashes or what-have-you. One thing I find a little unfair is that the game penalises you for putting up the route monitor. Well I'm afraid I need that for the signals, which are very hard to see otherwise. And why provide that feature if you're going to penalise players for making use of it?Overall, this is a pretty cool game that is a decent simulation and performs well, but it doesn't cater very well to first-time users, unlike later WOS editions. But once you've configured the keys and got the hang of driving, there is plenty of fun to be had, for sure!"
,Recommended,283600,13615011,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,SwippyOG ダニエル,I have World of Subways Vol.3 But I like this more. This really feels like a metro. I can't say the WoS Vol.3 doesn't. But I play this more than that one. So if you really wan't to get the veeling of a underground metro. This is such a good game.
,Recommended,283600,22184785,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,BailsBach,Definetely not for the people who want to jump straight into driving a train. Try Train Simulator (Railworks) if you want a simplistic experience.
76561198066020385,Recommended,283600,29051251,Posted: 5 January,all,Lunar Eclipse☆ﾟ,"A nice addition for the collection of the metro lovers out there!Description:In this game you play as a metro driver on the M7 line in Berlin. This line starts at Rathaus Spandau, all the way to Rudow and back! The length of this line is 55 minutes in total and it's one of the busiest lines in Berlin.For your shift, you can chose between 2 types of metro's: an old/ancient metro and a new one.Pros:+The sounds of the metro+Very realistic driver cabin+Ranking system that monitors your driving+The options to make the game more easy or more challenging (real time signals, ranking system, HUD enabled/disabled etc.)Cons:-No manual for this game, which makes it hard to understand the controls for the first time playing-Poor graphics inside the subway stations-No passengers on board during the driveConclusion:This game is decent.For the beginners its hard to understand playing it for the first time. But once you've settled it's a good simulator to play!Rating:7/10PS: Make sure to check out the other games in the WoS series, if you enjoyed this game."
76561198236852430,Recommended,283600,30159291,Posted: 24 February,all,housegrande,"If you already have experience with TS (Train Simulator) or TZ (Trainz), and are looking for something fast pace (tight schedules, AI loving to hold your train with red lights) and you really don't mind a few bugs left in the game (2 out of 5 missions/scenarios are broken, but the make your own shift  is just fine), then this is a simulation worth your time and money.  It all takes place underground.  You'll never see the light of day (play WOS3 -  London for daylight and weather).  If you've  never played a train sim, I wouldn't steer you away from WOS2, but it will be frustrating.  There is no tutorial  like TS or TZ and unless you read or understand German, (Youtube is no help, all reviews are in German) you're on you own.  After you configure/map the game controls to your liking, it just a matter of getting drive time before it all clicks and the sim becomes enjoyable.  For the current price I paid ($14.99) it gets my thumbs-up.There is a game manual in English and German.  It tells you a little history about the U7 Line and how to get the trains set up and moving.  It's very basic and learning to actually drive the trains is by trial and error.  It'll take about 1 to 2 hours for a novice and about 20 to 30 minutes for an experienced TS or TZ driver.  The graphics are very good and somewhat tweakable.  The audio effects aren't bad.  You will have radio communications with train dispatch, but it's all in German with English subtitles (don't forget to activate the subtitles).  There is one tidbit worth mentioning:  You will learn German phrases and the correct pronunciations.  Good luck and happy tubing."

76561198015894172,Not Recommended,283600,30570851,Posted: 17 March,all,prgeyer,"This game would be a lot more fun if it wasn't so incredibly buggy. Nothing I can do will make the Station Monitor work. Sometimes I will be switched to the opposite end of the train, so that I am suddenly in the driver's cab facing backwards. The sound is glitchy, and the graphics are jumpy. I have tried reaching out to the publisher through their technical support page on their website, but after a week I got no response. If the publisher would PLEASE post some bug fixes, I would be more than happy, as this is a good looking game that can be fun when it works properly. But those occasions are few and far between."

It needs a tutorial and some sort of general user interface or a dynamic interface like Microsofts Train Simulator on top of what it brings. It may of been great during it's time but I'm unable to play it. I am a big fan of Train Simulators or Subway Simulators, maybe the other volumes might be more stable. I think it needs a tutorial section where you get a chance to wall around and familiarize yoursself with the engine and the controls. There are not many scenarios."

The station and train designs are very accurate. The sounds, announcements combined overall with the art detail give a very Berlin feel, which the developers have managed to achieve.2. The outdoor camera shots of the moving train are spectacular, almost cinematic. It is a feature which I didn't find in WoS3 (London) which is quite ,,Schade!""CONS:1. The red lights: The game throws random red lights on the path for which you need to stop and wait, which can get very frustrating. It is especially bad when you're keeping a good schedule and a red light shows up to delay you by a full minute or two. Worse is that if you pass a red light, the game ends, which is a rather heavy penalty.2. The trains run empty, there are no passengers. They are seen on stations, frozen like statues but they don't board or leave the train."

Game is completely unplayable as a great deal of the picture is cut off, and so far I haven't been able to figure out how to get the game to display as it should...As my PC has a remarkable resemblance to, say, any old rag you can find around the house, I took a bit of a chance downloading this game. I have under 2 gigs of RAM and a 2.3 Ghz processor and the game runs. Not perfectly, but it runs and gameplay isn't bad at all. So if in doubt about the minimum specs, I'm pretty sure the game will run just fine if you meet the minimum specs.As for the game... It's fun and looks quite pretty. Had to look up the controls, especially for the older F90 train, but once you figure out how to set up the controls and how to use them, it's quite straight forward.I haven't played for that long yet, but I do feel the game is kind of lacking in it's replayability factor. It's all underground, and the modeling of stations is allright but kind of clinical. You will see people stand around, but that's about it. So what you are left with is a nice pastime of a game, but somewhat limited in things to see, try or do.I feel a price of 10 euros would be about the maximum to pay for what you ultimately get, and needless to say... You will probably need to be the type that likes these kinds of games. Flight Sim X Steam Edition is currently available for 12,summin and I definitely feel that that game offers a better deal and better replayability.However, I like the idea (which is why I bought it) and will follow the serieus with interest. I can't really tell how much improved later volumes are, but looking at Vol 2 I would say that some improvement to the gaming experience is possible. More things to do and see, better camera positions, etc... Bringing the game world to life as much as possible will add to the experience that these types of games can offer.All in all, I give it a 6/10. That is not as bad as it may look mind you. If you can spare the cash easily, like trains or subways and are a sim fan, this is worth a try and good for some relaxing fun. But one should not expect too much of it."
