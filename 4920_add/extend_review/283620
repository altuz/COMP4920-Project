,Recommended,283620,10105468,"Posted: 13 May, 2014",all,Immortan Joe,"This game is the definition of a simulation- it's very detailed and true to life. If you're into these kind of games then you'll enjoy it, if you're expecting an exciting game with heart pounding adventure then you'll be instantly bored.The game does feel like it needs a lot of polish - the interface is clunky - you have to hold the 'shift' button whenever you want to interact with any controls in the cabin - although there are keyboard shortcuts for some controls.Once you get used to the controls though driving the train is pretty easy and it's pretty cool seeing the different parts of London as you drive through - except of course when you're in a tunnel (which is a lot of the time) and that's the main problem with this game really, although the detailed and accurately modelled train stations are nice to see (which you can explore on foot as well).There are 2 modes you can play - missions and 'drive to schedule' which is basically free mode where you get to choose your route, time of day and weather. The missions are pretty much similar to train simulator - drive so and so route and keep to schedule - with emergencies and whatever else thrown in to challenge you.The game is very harsh when you do something wrong during a mission (like speeding) - it will instantly end the mission, instead of giving you penalty points like train simulator.I also had issues when first playing - the framerate was VERY low, as in 10-15 FPS. My PC can run Skyrim on ultra settings with a smooth framerate, so it was a bit surprising.I checked the graphics settings and turned the anti-aliasing and bump mapping sliders all the way down which made the game smooth and playable (I kept draw distance to 'very high' though which you'll want to do unless you don't mind having buildings pop out almost in front of you). After doing this the graphics still look impressive enough for me.I recommend it if you're really, REALLY into your sim games, if not you might want to save your money - you'll likely get bored after a while."

,Recommended,283620,10243165,"Posted: 26 May, 2014",all,Budderball,"I have only had this game for a little wile, and it is probably one of THE BEST simulators I have ever played!  Normal ones like Train Simulator 2014 you just sit there for an hour like, ""yep, this is pretty much it.""  But in this, you have more stops, more passengers, more enhanced gameplay experience.  The passengers dont just vanish onto your train, they actually go places. They pay attention to the onboard announcement system, they run to catch a train, and they know exactely where you and they are going.  Also, your not just stuck on the train, you can mve around on any platform and train.  You don't have to drive the train, you can ride it around!  I hope that there will b3e more updates, like multiplayer and more of the London Underground routes.  I give this game a 15/10!"
,Recommended,283620,10141182,"Posted: 16 May, 2014",all,GeorgeT93,"I've been enjoying my time in World of Subways 3. It's definitely a true simulator in every sense of the word. You are responsible for running a subway train in London's Underground on the Circle Line. You will need to set up your train before setting off, including going to the rear of the train to turn on your tail lights, then walking to the front of the train to start the train, turn on any additional lighting (headlights, cab light, passenger compartment lights) as well as turning on the heat for the passenger compartment. You will then need to change the train's sign to indicate the route you're running, and set up the automated voice messages to correspond to the route you're running, so that station arrivals are properly announced. You can also manually trigger announcements through the same control panel used for the automated messaging system.This is not a 'lite' simulator, you are responsible for performing your duties as if you were actually driving the subway train. Failure to follow speed limits will cause you to fail (at least in missions), and you want to maintain the schedule to the best of your ability. There are also signal lights that you will need to follow in order to be successful.The missions aren't so much missions as they are tutorials. They work well in this regard, however it would have been nice if they included a mission editor and workshop support so that more varied missions could be created by the community. The missions can be fun, though a bit challenging at first as you're learning the ropes of driving the train, and while you're learning the route, you can find yourself accidentally speeding, which can cause you to fail the mission requiring you to restart the mission from the beginning (if you wish to complete the mission at all, as the missions are optional.) Once you're done with the mission (if you choose to do them), you're then free to select a route and drive it, just as if you were scheduled to drive that route for your shift that day. While saving your progress is not possible during missions, you can save your progress when just driving a route. This affords you the ability to stop at a station, save the game, and return later to finish your 'shift'.Graphically, the game looks fantastic as there's lots of detail in and out of the tunnels, that give you the feel of really being on a subway line. Things like new pieces of rail sitting along the side of the tracks, that are waiting to be put in place are common, as are things like shipping pallettes. Each station seems unique and it seems quite a bit of attention to detail has been put into each station, so that the more you drive, the more easily you start to recognize a station as you pull in. I've never been to London, so I can't say whether the stations are accurate to their real-world counterparts, but I can say that each station definitely maintains a uniqueness, so you never feel like each station is just a cookie cutter copy and paste job of any other station. The models for the driver (your character) and the passengers could use some polish however.In the audio department, they've done a decent job using believable sound effects that you would expect to hear while riding on a subway train. I'd say they're a notch above utilitarian, but they're not bad by any stretch of the imagination. Simply, they do the job of conveying the sounds you would expect to hear in a believable manner.As for the controls, they work well, though I'm now using a Rail Driver unit with it instead of just the mouse and keyboard, which has helped me in terms of overall immersion. Despite using the Rail Driver controller, I still need to use the SHIFT + Mouse combination to interact with some things like the automated station announcement system. The Rail Driver unit is natively supported, but the levers and switches used do not line up with the default control stickers, so it takes a bit of getting used to. For example, the Auto Brake lever is actually the throttle control, while the Independant Brake lever is the gear selector. It feels a tad awkward at first since those aren't the way the controls are set up for other train simulators, but once you get used to it, it really does become second nature.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys passenger-orientated train operations simulations. The challenge is getting to each station on time without speeding or running any red lights. I'm running it quite well on my laptop (an HP DV6-6135dx) which has an AMD A-8 3500 APU, though I did have to turn a few graphics options down to smooth it out. I still get an occasional stutter here and there, but with the slightly lower graphical settings I'm using, it remains mostly a smooth experience.I would not recommend this for someone that just wants to drive a train as if they were driving a HO-Scale or N-Scale model railroad, as it's a bit more complex than that, but if you enjoy passenger operations in other simulators, and don't mind a bit of a learning curve in order to properly drive the train, then there's quite a bit of enjoyment to be had here."
,Recommended,283620,30002691,Posted: 18 February,all,Dr. Strangelove,"SummaryOverall, it's a pretty good sim. Graphics are fine, the route is done pretty well, and the ability to walk around your train and the stations is pretty cool. I can recommend it, but be prepared for something that will not work perfectly 100% of the time, but is done much better than other TML games like Fernbus Simulator or the following part of the World of Subways, WoS 4.What works1. Graphics are pretty decent.2. The train is pretty well-detailed and most of the switches work, including the automatic announcer which is a very nice touch. I really hate those supposedly realistic trains from other games where most of the switches don't work at all.3. I don't share complains about controls. Those pretty fine for me and easy to use.4. Route is pretty fun and varied.5. It's pretty simple to learn and not that hard to master. Ideal for a casual game to play in the evening, and it's really fun to do everything you can to keep on schedule.What doesn't work1. Stability. The game crashes way too often, and so far I was only able to finish full schedule once. Before that, the game crashed sometime after 30-40 mins. That's definitely not acceptable, especially that long after the game was released.2. Controls outside the train. They're extremely clunky, and you can easily get stuck inside the cabin and have to wait until you're unstuck.3. Character models. You created a game where you encounter other characters, make them at least passable.4. A bug prevented me from completing the tutorial. It didn't want to go through after going inside the front driver's cabin."

You cannot go left right or back, You can only go forward and using the mouse, This is very annoying, And also there are a ton of Glitches which put players off, In the whole, I Recommend this game."
,Recommended,283620,19049424,"Posted: 13 November, 2015",all,Tech Curse,"I have to admit that I didn't expect this game to actually be worth the price. It does everything right, World of Subways 3 allows you to experience driving a train in the London Underground. This experience, including the setting up of the trains, is modelled in detail and a lot of fun. You are limited to the London Circle Line, however the full line is a lot of fun to drive. You can also explore each station in first person or third person mode. Minor gripe: avoid using the first person mode, as it can be highly disorienting.The Pros:- Detailed simulation- Explore stations- Beautiful visuals- Above and below ground- Challenging missionsThe Cons:- First person view outside of the train's cab- Takes a while to figure out the game's logicWhat to remember:- Set up the tail lights at the end of your train.- You can figure out which way your train is heading by the lights. Look for the traffic management lights at the start of the platform. That is the direction your train is heading.- Don't forget to hit TAB to hit the deadman's switch.Who is this game for:- Fans of train simulators, like Train Simulator 2016. Just think about this as a piece of standalone DLC for Train Simulator.- Fans of simulation games.This game is worth it."

Turning on tail lights, cab lights, ventilation, passenger heat and light, adjusting the correct route to be displayed, programming the voice announcer, are just of few things to be done before leaving the first station.The only setback of the game (a minor one), are the cameras and player movement.The camera control is just a little weird, but nothing that you can't get used to.Also, if you change the the key bindings in the setting menu, the tutorial will use the default ones to explain how to play the game.Other than this few thing, the game is great."

,Recommended,283620,11327720,"Posted: 19 July, 2014",all,iomex,"A really stunning and immersive simulator, a million miles away from 'Bus and Cable Car Simulator'. The graphics are gorgeous, the sounds are convincing and the driving experience itself is realistic.I love how there are other AI trains running in the network which you can (and sometimes need to) board. I love how passengers board and disembark trains, and how station announcements call just like in real life.And I also love how well it runs on my computer. Other TML games (particularly Bus and Cable Car) run pretty poorly. The engine has clearly been optimized.However - it does need a good polish. Some negative points:• You cannot move if the camera cuts into your avatar• 'THAT' stepping/walking sound• Depth-of-field, even when turned off• The missions need to be better explained - careful consultation of a tube map sometimes isn't enough. A few times I've set off in the wrong directionBut most importantly: Gameplay will be instantly cut for failing to set up your train correctly, for running red lights, for going even a LITTLE over the limit, for accidently opening doors on a service run, etc. Having to go through the mission ALL OVER AGAIN cause you accidently pressed F5 is a ballache.However, these are small points, and so long as you drive to the book on missions, they will certainly not spoil your experience.9/10 overall."

,Recommended,283620,23459986,"Posted: 8 June, 2016",all,Screen 7,"A very nice representation of the London Underground Circle Line. Trundling around it is good fun. The graphics are generally good and the driving aspect seems realistic.That said, it is still a simulation game by a company who clearly don't have English as a first language, making the missions dull, the tutorial a bit awkward and some of the in-game information a bit odd. I'm not sure if the stats actually work because I seem to get the same score every time.Setting up the train is an annoyance in the early stages, but it soon becomes second nature. Once you're rolling it's fairly straightforward and the HUD's provide useful info that without them, it'd be a much harder sim.It does have a bit of an ""early access"" vibe to it, so I would recommend waiting for it on discount. I'm glad I didn't pay the 18.99 asking fee for it, I would have felt ripped off. There are some quirks which just make it seem a bit unpolished. But the driving and track detail is very polished, everything else is average. The menu screen doesn't even make sense, it's a bunch of Matrix numbers floating around, absolutely nothing to do with the London Underground, or trains, or anything really.I just wanted to drive some trains around the Circle Line, I was able to do that, so can only recommend it. Just because the graphics can be raised or lowered, doesn't affect me, I always play on low cos I prefer frame-rate over ambient occlusion, so no extra nor removed points there. But there are some reservations still and so would say at full price you might feel a bit cheated.+ Lovely representation of the Circle Line+ Fun to drive your train, fairly simple driving mechanics after steep introductory learning curve+ You ultimately know what you're in for if you're looking at this type of game, and it delivers that well enough- Only 2 basic modes of play, and with bugged stats that effectively makes it just 1 mode of play - drive a train from A to B because you want to drive a train from A to B.- Price doesn't reflect the quality of the game, the budget went into the track mapping, everything else suffered- It's a simulation only, there is no ""game"", the missions are lackluster and they could have easily created twice as many (and had some English proof-read it)Another point is knocked off because they've purposefully disabled their Steam forum here, so if you have any tech questions and are looking for quick answers which Steam forums generally always provide, well you've pretty much been told to go ♥♥♥♥ yourself. No Steam forum for your Steam game is a big no-no in this day and age, especially when your game could do with an update or two!6/10"

Anyone looking at this game has a love for the subject matter, and the package/presentation seem promising......But less than thirty seconds in, you begin to miss basic 1st-person functionality, such as walking backwards. The collision fields are not very generous (for example, it's easy to get stuck by the cabin seat). Falling onto the tracks sends you to the abyss, and I experienced a system-crippling crash within the first five minutes of trying to operate the train (without the knowledge bestowed by the tedious tutorial).If you really just want the experience of The Tube, this simulator simply isn't ready for prime time just yet.

You have lots of stations, and because of this, you are always paying attention. It makes you really feel like a Train Driver.

76561198197404099,Recommended,283620,25006281,"Posted: 18 August, 2016",all,Keeper1st,"When I first got this, it crashed to desktop every other time I tried to start a mission, and 20 minutes into my first non-training mission it suddenly turned into a slideshow before the computer locked up entirely. However, after rebooting the PC, I have had no such issues. (However, with RadeonPro active I had to CTRL-ALT-DEL then Cancel to get the missions to start. Removing RadeonPro, all was well. That's an old third-party app anyway; I thought I'd give it a try.)I had to assign the ""Interact"" control to a different key and use that in place of the instruction to click on a door with the mouse, as there is no mouse pointer when you're in walk mode. Without doing that, I couldn't get more than two minutes into the training mission, as it was impossible to close the cabin door from the outside.I also found the automatic announcement system to be off by one station (I think I failed to use the ""next station is closed"" announcement when passing through a closed station), but when I tried to reprogram it at South Kensington, it still kept announcing ""This is Gloucester Road"" even though I'd just told it to start from South Kensington. Minor issue, since you should know to hit the ""station closed"" button before you reach the closed Blackfriars station.Also, one of the early missions has some incorrect text, as it tells you to take over a train on Platform 4, when actually the train is on Platform 3. In general the English text is rather clunky; the developers are native German speakers and they didn't hire any native English speakers to work on their English translations.It didn't seem to mind that I had forgotten to set the destination sign on the train in the first non-training mission. I've now finished a few missions. While there appears to be no scoring system whatsoever -- you either complete the mission or you don't -- in fact there is something happening in the background. In a mission where you have to make up time, at the end I was told I had achieved ""59 of 60"" and therefore failed, but nothing that explained what those numbers represent. When completing missions, it doesn't appear take all the details into account like the destination sign.However, I just tried to do a non-mission ""Drive to Schedule"" run, and at the end, it did point out that I hadn't set the destination sign correctly (I had set it to the ending station, but apparently that's not right -- maybe it wants the basic ""Circle Line""), and did in fact present a score of 72%. It mentioned braking too hard, going over the speed limit, and having the announcement system set wrong (which I did on the first station). So maybe that ""59 of 60"" in my failed mission means a score of 60% was necessary, even though mission completion screens don't give you any such score.If you're not intimately familiar with the stations it can be difficult to know which way is east and which way is west sometimes. So when you have to take a train from High Street Kensington to Edgware end, you might take off and find the next station to be Gloucester instead of Notting Hill. I guess that's part of the challenge!EDIT: In so doing the above mistake, I discovered that you can't actually collide with AI trains. When I found myself at the Gloucester Road station and realized I was going the wrong way, I reset the train to drive the opposite way and found myself head-on with another train that was stopped waiting for me. I figured the mission was over and decided slowly to bump into the AI train head-on... but I ended up driving straight through it and actually was able to complete the mission despite my detour.Anyway, I am quite enjoying it. The detail is really nice. You have to (or rather, can) switch everything -- right down to the heating and ventilation systems for the passengers. (The windows even fog up if you don't turn the ventilation on, during certain times of night and weather conditions.) It doesn't have any complaint system from passengers like Bus Simulator 16 for example, though, at first glance or when doing missions, but in Drive to Schedule mode it does point out if you were braking too hard, so that counts as a passenger complaint.If you want to slack off from your mission you can just hop onto any of the AI trains and take a ride as a passenger! That's pretty cool.The riding of AI trains is part of the normal gameplay too. Some of your missions require you to hop onto a train to a particular station in order to take over control of another train at that station. Really nice feature! (As long as you know which way is east and which way is west so you get on a train in the correct direction!) The map included with the game is the entire Underground system; downloading a specific Circle Line map from the internet is highly recommended -- just make sure you get one from the 2009 expansion of the line, and make a note on it to yourself about Blackfriars being closed (for it was when this game was made), so you know when to hit the ""next station is closed"" button on the announcement computer in order to keep your announcements in synch (not that the game really cares if your announcements are correct, or even used at all; this game is very much a self-policing sim except in cases of speeding, running red lights or derailment (if derailment is turned on in options)).So, as a simulation game, I do recommend it, despite all the crashes and the system lockup I experienced initially. Maybe my CPU or GPU was starting to overheat or something. I know many people have no such worries so I can't fault it too much -- just be aware that it may not be particularly stable for you, but try rebooting after installation, as that seems to have cured it for me. (It's using some sort of nVidia-branded engine, so it could be that it doesn't play nicely with ATI graphics cards.)In terms of graphics settings, it has no anti-aliasing, so you might want to force your graphics card to provide that if you can handle the frame rate. The ""Glow"" option is HDR glow which is really horrible -- causing complete whiteout on a lot of signs. I found it looks much better with the Glow turned off. It does provide an anisotropic filtering slider, a selection of shadow qualities, the ability to turn off bump mapping, reflections, a simpler lighting system, etc., so there's a fair bit of optimization you can do if your frame rates suffer. I keep most things on max (shadows to Medium, Depth-of-Field Blur off and Motion Blur off), and manage 30 to 45 fps on average with my ATI R9 270, which is all right since you're never going over 40 mph."

If it was, you would call driving a subway IRL is a game. That is how amazing the realism, physics, and controls are. You find that if anything, this is a true simulator, just with game quality graphics, (go look at the training simulators for heavy macheinery.)I'm still in awe about the quality of the physics. The train (if you'll call it that) responds like the ones I remember from my trips to London. You even get full functionality of the switches, panels, you name it. If you see it, odds are it does something. You really need to do the tutorial to know how to do stuff, as I've said, it's got every part. You need to do stuff in both ends of the train before it will move.The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, as from my experience so far the weather seems ""Stuck"", like it's about to rain, but there is still some lighting like a sunny day on certain scenery objects. The graphics do put all of the parts on the dash and train into account. You just have to see that for yourself. I really can't say much on the performance, as I built my computer with flagship parts, I don't know what it'll run like for you.There are a few things that seem to take away from the simulator. Example: ""Game Over"" when you pass a red light even by a micron split in half. I just wish it didn't show the game over, because it's frustrating, and people pass red lights by up to ten feet, and they aren't shot on sight for it. The menu also seems a little bland and unintuitive, not a big issue, but leaves a bad first impression. Then the controls can be finicky, as it can be hard to know where a ""rotating"" type switch, and sometimes ""spins cluelessly"" if you don't know what way to move the mouse for that control.Overall: It's a goodgameSimulator when you get it on sale."

,Recommended,283620,17141781,"Posted: 20 July, 2015",all,DeanGeddes,"This is an excellent game. Well worth the money. The graphics are superb and it replicates the London Underground very well. I think that it is great that they included the new Hammersmith line extension. Not only can you drive trains, but you can also walk around and explore the world of the Circle Line. You can get on other trains to go to different stations. This is a brilliant simulation game for anyone interested in the Underground. There are even dynamic passengers on the platforms and the automated announcement system is included with the game. It does require quite a meaty graphics card though. I have 12GB RAM, Intel Core i7 processor and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 850M graphics card. It works well on my system, with only the slighest bit of lag (about 2 seconds about every 4 minutes). Perhaps I can overcome this by adjusting some settings (not tried this yet).There's only a couple of issues I have spotted with the game so far. The penalising is quite harsh. If you go just about 5mph over the speed limit, it says 'game over'! You don't even get a warning! This can be very frustrating, especially if you have been driving in a mission for about half and hour! Also, if you pass a red light, the same applies, but I suppose that is fairer.But overall, this is an excellent game and I've had lots of fun playing it!"

The UI and controls are really quite painful - a bit like playing a game from 10 years ago (think Alone in the Dark) - but once you get past that, it's quite enjoyable.It's very realistic and even down to detail around things like Blackfriars being closed (it was for a long time, presumably when this was being made), station detail, backgrounds, etc.Good game overall, if this is your thing, but I have nothing to compare with.PS Why are there no discussions for this game?PPS They should do the Piccadilly line."

Despite it now becoming more and more out of date, it gives a good representation of what the line was like after the extension of the Circle Line before the introduction of the S stock. Good gameplay and working announcments. :)"

,Recommended,283620,25399687,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,Lord_Hanky_Flymo,"I am really into games where you role-play as some sort of working schlub, and this game does not disappoint.  I have to admit that I have always been a train buff, and when I was a kid I used to be allowed to drive the tube train between Epping Ongar (those were the days – you will never be allowed to do that now).  I remember once being the London Transport Museum in London, and hogging the train simulator which consisted of a laserdisc controlled with authentic tube train controls rather than the players remote-controller.  So this game has the potential to scratch this particular itch of mine.  So does it?Yes it does is the answer.  If I have an hour free, I'll drive a train from Edgeware Road to Hammersmith watching as the passengers fall through the ceiling, land on the platform and board my train, just as I'm ready to shut the doors.  I'll get frustrated in a good way when I get stuck at a red light at Aldgate, and have to follow a slow district line train all the way to Edgeware Road knowing that scheduling has gone completely to pot.Less entertaining though is the fact that even if I leave every station exactly on time, it still seems to tell me that I didn't teach a schedule.  It seems to randomly complain that I braked too hard.  It inconsistently whinges about the setting of the destination board.  So I seldom ever get above 83% approval.  So that could do with patching.So this sounds pretty negative right?  Yes, but I would still recommend this game.  If you're 100% completion nut, the buggy rating system will get on your plums.  Luckily for me I'm really not that bothered – I could not give an airborne act of copulation if those wingey digital passengers went shooting down the carriage and brained themselves on an old ladies walking frame when I nearly overshot the station at Farringdon.  I just find the whole experience extremely relaxing.I'm running a GTX 690, 16 GB and a Sandy Bridge Core I7, and I'm running the game on what passes for the ultra settings.  There does seem to be quite a bit of frame dropping, particularly in tunnels but it's not a dealbreaker.  I have not had any hard crashes or game breaking bugs.  Yes, when you walk off the platform you fall into the void and respawn and as I have said the passengers do some pretty spectacular acrobatics – including throwing themselves in front of a train.  So although you can walk about it's not the most polished aspect of the game – but to worry about that will be missing the point.In summary, for me this game is great.  More please.  Preferably the Central Line.  With the long closed Epping – Ongar branch included."
