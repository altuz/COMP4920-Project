The game explains this terribly and it controls even worse. I'm not sure why this was made but hey, if you feel like wasting $1.97, pick this up. If you want to not be frustrated, disoriented and possibly sickened, skip this."

,Not Recommended,283660,9953226,"Posted: 27 April, 2014",all,HadBabits,"Pretty basic: The narrator reads a line from Alice in Wonderland which, word by word, fly at you. You have to dodge between the letters and thereby pick them up as you go; if you fill out the words ""rabbit hole"" you get an extra life, i.e. an extra chance, when you inevitably die.As someone who thoroughly enjoyed Super Hexagon, I can't say I reccomend. It's hard, not just because it tests your reflexes, but 3D objects flying at you without any indication of which plane you're positioned on makes it difficult to tell if you're in going to make it in the gap or not. And each time you move left or right the camera does an awful jerk that's strainful to the eyes. I'd pass."

It's alright if you can get it under a buck and since it comes with cards it mostly pays for itself then.The real issue with the game it feels like a free flash game for the most part.
,Not Recommended,283660,11464754,"Posted: 29 July, 2014",all,Erbkaiser,"Horrible controls kill this game.I can get behind the concept, and the music is fitting, but the only supported inputs are the arrow keys. Even if you try to map a controller in the Unity options, the game ignores it.Gameplay in a nutshell: you are glued to either the top or bottom of the screen, and need to pass through the gaps between letters in order to collect them to form the word shown at the bottom of the screen. Unfortunately you have very little time to react, and combine that with a tilting camera that makes it extra unclear where exactly your block is located compared to the upcoming letters, and this game becomes less about skill and more about luck.This game either needs to get rid of the tilting camera, or give some kind of indication where exactly your cursor is, by a shadow or light in front perhaps. In its current state it only serves as a source of frustration."

I guess the goal is to not hit words you are falling toward but it is hard to see if you will hit them or not with the way the camera is angled plus camera jerking. also its not very fun to play.

As far as the jerking motion is concerned it should jerk because it needs to have dimension to it. This is a minimalist game so nothing spectacular should be expected. Now if you are having trouble with getting through the game then don't write a bad review because you are having difficulties. Instead just focus on what you need to work on and try again. Some of the things I like best of this game is the effect of the letters coming straight out you as well as the electronic music. I thought the story of Alice and Wonderland played the whole time and not have sudden pauses in the game. I would recommend having at least 3 lives for a game like this to be fair. overall I would give this 4-5 stars.

Just how far does this rabbit fall go. I chosae the red pill and I found the game very challenging. It requires reflex memory and acute memorization. Part of the catch is trying to spell out phrases like Rabbit Hole as you sail through letters. How ever, it is very punishing when it comes to colliding with a letter. It is not always easy to quickly choose a path. Even then, you must decide to aim for the needed letters or take the safe way to the next set of words.This game is simple but fun and addicting. For the price, you can get more than your money's worth. Playfire folks can earn even more money back playing this until next Monday. If you love Super Hexagon, buy this now!"

,Not Recommended,283660,15513408,"Posted: 23 April, 2015",all,Not-So-Serious Sam,"""Rabbit Hole 3-D"" is essentially a slapdash flight simulator. You attempt to pilot a little pixellated cube around the words of the first chapter of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" as they come rushing toward the screen. Unfortunately, the awkward camera angle robs the player of any reliable sense of depth, or even the ability to see what's coming around corners until it's too late. This is, shall we say, kind of a game-killer where precision and timing are supposed to be crucial to the player's survival.To make matters worse, by the time level 4 or 5 rolls around, the screen starts to spin but the controls don't spin along with it, so that left becomes right and up becomes down and so on and so forth, over and over as the screen continuously spins. Meaning that you will die a lot (which isn't so bad) and unfairly (which is). I think this was originally a mobile game, so maybe it controls better on a phone, but on a PC it's just tedious and a waste of time."

,Not Recommended,283660,16303027,"Posted: 11 June, 2015",all,Nickel II Sulfate,"I think what gets to me more than just an awful game is a game that could NOT have been awful. A game with potential to actually be fun and difficult and full of smooth techno dance music that helps you get into the jam. But this game just wasn't it. I can't say much about a game I've loggeed barely an hour on. But I promise there is a reason for that.The premise of Rabbit Hole 3D is similar to games like Velocibox or to some extent Impossible Game, Geometry Dash, and Super Hexagon. They consist of one stagnant object (that you control) juxtaposed with a constantly moving surrounding area. These areas have tons of walls and colors and twists and turns that you as the poor afixed object must dodge while jamming out to hardcore techno. A lot of the times what makes these games so enticing isn't the challenge (and boy, can they be challenging) but the progression of the music as you go deeper and deeper into...the rabbit hole.A lot of these games are made to be really hard--they're made to keep you pressing to keep going and jamming to that hardcore dubstep. You want to find out what happens next in the song or the space around you. And this time you'll get passed that hard jump...or turn...or whatever it is you just. keep. running. into.And all of the above games I've mentioned would probably be way more fun than Rabbit Hole. Because a lot of the previously mentioned games don't have the one problem that Rabbit Hole DOES have: A shoddy camera.Rabbit Hole's camera is presented behind you almost directly behind the box. You can't really tell your position on the plane--nor the position of the words. Everytime you move the camera jerks disorientingly with you--changing the angle to one that is even harder to differentiate. Am I in front of a hole or a letter?  Will I make it through or will I be forced to fall flat on my face and start ALL the way over? You can move what feels like infinitely left and right--but when it comes to up and down you can only move twice: once up and once down. It just feels awkward. You FEEL like you should be able to move similarly on the y axis as you do the x but you just can't. Why did you do thisdeveloper?...Why?...I've tried to play this game. I've made it maybe four seconds into the song? Hell the songs aren't even that great...or maybe they are and I just can't be bothered to tear my hair out trying to differentate how far off my character is from the L or I!Perhaps this is a beef I have only...perhaps this game is actually not as disorienting and frustrating as I've made it out to be. But if you really want a well thought out ryhthmy challenge game just get Geometry Dash or Super Hexagon. Because honestly...if you needed to know what happened when Alice went down the rabbit hole you'd have a less frustrating time just reading Lewis Carol's original story."

The music is is sub par in my opinion, maybe a 3/10 even with all of the music I like to listen to. The gameplay is linear, but the controls are probably the most offputting of all. Sometimes you move 1 space at a time, sometimes you move to the opposite side of the board. I dont know if this is some odd mechanic but one game after the last card I thought I was actually going to get past the first sentance for once, and I tapped up to dodge an E after passing under an H, and hit the top of the E.

The controls are a little jerky, that much is certain. Coupled with the frantic pacing, however, this game transforms from children's read-along to a game that will test the reflexes of even the most seasoned gamers. The best way to describe the difficulty is to liken it to I Wanna Be The Guy and Super Meat Boy- Beating each level is doable, and the frustration that comes from attempting this game is of a fun sort.Not much else can be said about this. It is a bit of a shame that the game is based around a children's story, as the difficulty is so great that you likely won't see any playing it. Also, a feature to buy audio books as DLC, the ability to adjust the speed, and possibly a feature that would allow the game as an audiobook visualizer are much desired. 6/10."
