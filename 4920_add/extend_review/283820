,Recommended,283820,20237116,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,Myrna,It’s a solid shooter loosely based off of the RAYCRISIS series (as it seems to be for 90% of shumps). I spent a decent amount of time on this and will come back.It uses 3D graphics but doesn’t fall into the pit that Solar Shifter EX did. There was some confusion as to what to do about the ground units but i’ll figure that out.Will return to it and finish it.

76561198076484810,Recommended,283820,24050447,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,Kob,"Kamui is a vertical 2D shoot'em up released exclusively for PC (Windows) in 1999 by japanese Indie developer Siter Skain. This game is part of the trilogy "" The Tale of Alltynex "" composed of  the games: Kamui, Reflex and Alltynex Second. Kamui is considered one of the best shoot'em ups released for PC, something I have to agree, because the game is really great! Kamui's gameplay is heavily inspired by the games Rayforce, Raystorm and Raycrisis made by Taito  Corporation. In Kamui you have three types of weapons at your disposal: the front gun that can be upgraded;  the ray gun, seeking and hitting the enemy in the lower layers in relation to your ship and finally a powerful, concentrated shot that smashes the enemies, but that depends on an energy bar in a scheme similar to the classic R-Type. The game has a nice and fluid gameplay, very tasty and fun. The controls work very well with the Xbox 360 controller and the music is wonderful and very engaging! An excellent game that has my strong recommendation!

I felt like a kid in an arcade again.  And the vertical elements were implemented seamlessly. :-D

It originally came out in 1999, but the gameplay stands up to the test of time. Initially I was concerned when I launched the game because the default display settings had the game so small, I found it hard to see all the bullets. They do provide a configuration utility which you can use to adjust the settings to your liking, which fixed the aformentioned issue I was having.The game consists of six levels with multiple difficulty settings, with each taking about 5 minutes to complete. If you're the kind of shmup player who just likes to tear through shooters, you'll like that the game provides unlimited continues. In order to get the score based achievements though, you'll have to hone your skills.Tight controls, nice difficulty, and solid gamplay make this a must have for the shmup pc player.You can see my let's plays here:http://youtu.be/GpJmAJpc_AE?list=PLKgGWqAhYeD_C2ud6AwVP3HuC62Gt4pGc"

Trying to balance out the use of each of the three weapons is key to winning this game.Well worth the $8 spent.What's more interesting is that this is a series that was made backwards, meaning that kamui is the ending of the triology of games."

I could spend all day playing these and Pac-Man.It is a fast paced shooter, with 3 forms of attacking. Lightning lasers for enemies under you, bullets for enemies ahead of you, and a powerful laser attack that deals a ton of damage and can destroy 99% enemy attacks, so use that wisely, it runs out quickly.It is about a 30 minute gameplay, faster if you can do it on 1 credit.10/10 Runs well, plays smooth, and fun and challenging."

OK.A nice little game with several difficulty levels and poor (but very fast moving) graphics in the shooter late 1980's arcade game style of ALLTYNEX second or Raiden III. Some replayability, this game's major virtue is that it's cheap and easy to install and run and pretty much any computer."
,Recommended,283820,16005560,"Posted: 25 May, 2015",all,Lime Cultivist,"Kamui is a vertical shooter that was made by Siter Skain in 1999 for Windows.Well, I actually didn't know any of that until I got this game a few days ago. I had never heard of Kamui before, being a fan of shmups that is rather out of the loop on the world's favorite shooters.The ship that the player pilots from start to finish in this game is, if I'm correct, a Kamui fighter: a powerful machine controlled by the daughter of the game's antagonist. The story of Kamui remains very simple throughout, with the game's beginning scene and ending credits being the only points of plot. I don't believe story is usually focused on much when it comes to shooters, but I do wish the plot was at least a bit more fleshed out.Coming from 1999, Kamui's graphics are predictably not at all impressive by today's standards. The game shows its age in this aspect with its pixelated designs - it gives it somewhat of an arcade feeling (though I think its only current platform is Windows). None of this bothers me much, as the dated graphics work well as far as the gameplay goes. One of the most frustrating issues I tend to have with shooters is trying to distinguish just exactly what is going on at all times amidst the chaos. Nothing is worse than dying to one tiny bullet just because you couldn't see it very well, and were in the middle of focusing on something else. During my time with Kamui so far, I have never encountered this. I have been hit by small individual bullets; but they were bright yellow, and running into them was my fault. Overall, Kamui's colors are distinguishable and bright enough that it is easy enough to tell what is happening most of the time without them being distracting and looking out of place.As far as sound goes, I really like Kamui's soundtrack. It is hard to focus on it while actually playing, but watching videos of this game gives a great opportunity to hear its music. It doesn't stand up to Ikaruga and Mushihimesama, in my opinion, but the tracks seem fitting and immersive with the game's action.The best part of Kamui is, as with all great shmups, the gameplay. Along with movement and pausing, Kamui only makes use of two other buttons in its control scheme, keeping it simple but effective with the game's mechanics. One button is used to fire the main shot and the other is used to release lightning. Kamui uses, throughout the game, a two-plane system: enemies and objects are in either the foreground or the background, and may change planes. The only way to hit enemies in the background is to use the lightning system. A meter at the corner of the screen shows how much charge the lightning has, which will slowly fill on its own or will increase greatly in speed if the player holds down the lightning button. When a bolt destroys an enemy in the background, you will receive a score multiplier of up to x16 based on how full the meter was upon use. The amount of lightning to actually be released is based on a charge orb shown in front of the Kamui ship, which will grow when the lightning is not being used. The third weapon of the Kamui is used if both buttons are held at the same time, which results in a very powerful laser that will destroy most bullets it comes into contact with. This does effect the lightning meter, however: the blue meter will be pushed back until the laser's red meter depletes, limiting the score multiplier of the lightning. Correctly using these weapons is essential to surviving and scoring. Destroying enemy bullets with the laser will hurt your score if used too copiously, forcing you to think and time uses of each power.If there's one thing that I really love about Kamui, it is its difficulty. Kamui is both forgiving and unforgiving, which is something that I usually cannot say about other shmups. There are three difficulties: easy, normal, and hard, each of which starts you with two lives and four bars of shield. Taking a hit will result in losing a piece of the shield, and will destroy the ship if it has no shield left. Taking a hit will also reduce a level of the ship's main shot, which is powered up by green drops from particular enemies throughout the stages, some of which also drop a blue power up that will give you an additional bar of shield.The main part of Kamui that surprised me though: unlimited continues. This is one aspect of this game that makes it extremely enjoyable - I was actually able to play through the entire game on my first try. Of course, getting a game over will reset your score to zero, and very quickly my goal in the game became trying to score as high as I could. A very important part of scoring that I have yet to focus on is (I think it’s called) deathlocking. Certain enemies that you’ve killed in the foreground will have a few frames before they explode in which you can finish them off with lightning, allowing one to get a massively high score if used right.With 3 hours put into the game as I write currently, the improvement I’ve experienced has been very satisfying. I still haven’t completed the game without a continue (on easy, too), but I’ve gone down from 6 continues to 1 since my first play, and my highest score has grown from around 2.6 million to almost 11 million. To see such a jump is rewarding and motivational to keep playing the game and improving. I haven’t had it for long, but I would definitely recommend Kamui to anyone that likes shmups, casual or not."

Especially if you are a big BIG fan games like Rayforce which is very reminisent of this game. Every bit of the game reminds me of Rayforce and Raystom from the lock-on system to the graphics itself! The graphics itself isn't great by today standards but wounderfully replicated the effects and graphics rayforce had back then. I would only recomend this game to fellow shmup fans and players out there especially the softcore ones who played games simmilar to Rayforce and other not so maniac bullet hell shooters. oh, and if you played Thunder Force V and digging it's music like me, this game will be a treat! The game uses the same PCM instruments used in Thunder Force V! I believe it's the same instruments and I love that they did that. This game brings back old 90's Shmup nostalgia to me. I wish I still have a copy of Thunder Force V and a fully functioning raystom PCB cabinet. Hopefully steam would be brining these great shmup titles like those I said earlier."

Balancing your use of vulcan/big laser/lightning is a very satisfying minigame of offense vs defense vs scoring. I would welcome an HD remake.PROTIP: Holding the lightning button makes your meter charge faster. Of course, doing this means you can't shoot without releasing your charge. Getting a high score often means dodging around while you wait for the ideal bugzapping moment."
