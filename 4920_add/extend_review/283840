Very balanced difficulty and mechanics while having much tighter pacing and level design. Stages tended to drag on in Kamui and RefleX but you never get that feeling here. Scoring system feels very natural and the sword attack (reminiscent of Radiant Silvergun) + special weapons are incredibly satisfying to use. The fully 3D graphics are understated but the game features excellent art direction and impressive effects in certain places. Music is an unabashed tribute to the iconic rocking themes of Hyakutaro Tsukumo from Technosoft fame. Highly recommended to anyone, not just genre fans. (I recommend disabling the shot + sword for special attack command, and the annoying pause when killing enemies with the sword that is enabled by default.)"

After some time learning Second, this is still every bit an ALLTYNEX shoot-em-up.  My one wish would've been more original boss archetypes; most of these are reused from KAMUI and RefleX.  However, because it's a visual jump, I'll forgive it that.  The devs probably wanted to make the game play well first.  And with that, they surely succeeded.10/10 Would shmup again."

I have played to many shoot em ups since then and I have found only a few worth playing. Of course Radiant Silvergun, Ikaruga, Gradius V and Gaiden and so on. Alltynex second is clearly worthplaying. It has good graphics, good music and smart gameplay that includes a silvergun-style sword.As hapens with Ikaruga, it is a bit too short, but I strongly recommend it. By the way, I am enjoying very much Reflex, so I should say that the tales of alltynex package is a good choice."
76561198092592407,Recommended,283840,24436667,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,TheMMM,"This is my favorite game from the Tales of ALLTYNEX series. It's so fun going up to large enemies and destroying them with the ship's swords. One of my favorite moments is near the end of the game, where a sattelite is trying to blast the ship with a giant space laser. That's epic. The soundtrack is pretty good too. However, I do have a problem with how the game handles moments where the camera angle changes. The playing area won't change to accomadate the different camera angles, and this can screw the player over in certain sections (such as the stage 3 boss's final phase) because it's not clear where the boundary is. This can lead to the player bumping into an invisible wall while trying to dodge bullets, causing them to get killed. Another issue I have with the game is that sometimes enemies will materialize out of thin air. The game's still fun though, I just think that the issues that I listed should be fixed so the game looks more professional."

The weapons system is interesting, but once you get used to it... Well, that's all you get.Turns off aero when it runs and crashes when I alt-tab.It's cheap, though, so I'll let it pass."

If not, you'll probably still love this one. And if you did? Well, even more so. Blasting and slashing one's way through enemy fleets and defenses using a well-rounded arsenal of four distinctive weapons divided between two tactically important flight modes, all but the most reluctant will learn to love this gem.It's challenging, but fair. You'll need some reflexes and depth perception to enjoy it, true -but if you practice and try new things then odds are you'll do better and get farther each time, and the satisfaction of pulling off dashing ace piloting sequences through radiant cluster blossoms of fire and scrap is well worth the effort. Besides, what's the point of destroying an armada that isn't very likely to kill you and everyone you like if you don't?Anyone who complains about the graphics needs to find something valid to complain about. This game is pretty to look at and runs super-smoothly. The story helped draw me in, and the sense of desperation it exhibits is palpable in the gameplay as well. Bonus points if you rattle off heroic pilot commentary while playing. In japanese, of course.Oh, and don't let the 'second' in the title fool you -this is the first game in the trilogy, if I'm not mistaken..."

76561198075673573,Recommended,283840,21010369,"Posted: 6 February, 2016",all,wrygrass,"I rate ALLTYNEX Second (I can't figure out the name of this game either), 3.5, It's okay if you like this sort of thing.This is a fairly exciting bullet hell space action late 1980s styled arcade game which will seem familiar to anyone whos played Crimson Clover or Raiden III. The weapons systems on your spacecraft take a little getting used to but other than that there is nearly no learning curve to this game. However, this game is extremely difficult and can be frustrating at times (like other games in its series).  This game runs adequately although I suffered one computer freeze from this game when turning it off. It's fairly creative and frenetic and exciting but if played more than just casually it can get repetitive and frustrating. Best to get this one on a special Steam sale if you get it."

Goooooood.The music is outstanding, the controls are tight, enemies are... well, as varied as they are in shmups.My single complaint (one that I'm sure will cease to be an issue once I play more) is that certain things that look like obstacles to avoid can be flown through while others a'blow you up. Minor quibble that'll get learned over time.Do I recommend this? Resounding yes. If you like Raiden, you'll like this. If you like Cave's series of bullet hell games, you'll like this. There's something for everyone here, and did I mention the outstanding music? Mein Gott im Himmel."
