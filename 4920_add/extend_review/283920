If you remember playing this game all those years ago you WILL remember every sound and all those little clickables that made this game a gem.

Putt Putt is a massve singlle player MMO RPG and it is not for the weak of heart. This game is an esstiental traning game for DOTA players. Putt Putt is a crimanal who steals free bird sead and magnets without a second glance.  In this game you must go down dark allies and into horrific caves to find possibly rabid dogs to take into a parade. Putt putt also brings up many political issues like lowering the minum wage to one penny. Obviesly this game is highly controversial. The playthrough is brutal but the end is very worth it. This parade will probably be the most exiteing moment of your life.10/10 best game Putt Putt is high on putt pot

For starters the depiction of some of the characters in this game are racially insensitive, an example being the car at the grocery store with his stereotipical italian mustache and his mario type accent. At one Point you have to find a dog to enter the parade. In order to do that you have to find a bone and once you do you lure the dog into the car with it, the equivelent to me luring a child into a van with candy. I do however praise the game for its realistic depictions of neighborhoods. Red street is the equivilent to living in Richmond, CA. House #2 has a♥♥♥♥♥♥shack of a house that is damaged and has a cracked window. When the car came out to greet Putt-Putt it seemed like he was tweaking and even called me Pitt-Pitt before correcting himself. Green street and blue street however are more upscale like Oakland Hills. With all these problems in the game I cant deny my childhood. This game gets a 5 out of 5."

Putt Putt found Pep in a freaking cave? Seriously?2. Some of the cars have cool lawns to mow and others have boring ones.3. The 'parade' was closer to six cars driving alone - where were the other cars that supported the parade? The only cars there were those who actually drove in it.4. The cat in the joke booth doesn't give a single eff.5. That mother car who lost her baby car in the movie house is too damn lazy to go in herself and find her own car-child!6. Putt Putt never had a car wash before this game? How does a car that lives in a town with like six buildings and one of them is a car wash, never have a car wash?Overall - if you played the game as a child, give a whirl, the nostalgia is worth it alone but remember this game is for children so don't expect a challenge, just enjoy the 'ride'!"

,Recommended,283920,16479100,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,ratstomper86,"Crayfish, also known as crawfish, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, or mudbugs, are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters, to which they are related; taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills and are found in bodies of water. Some species are found in brooks and streams where there is fresh water running, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and rice paddies. Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted water, although some species such as Procambarus clarkii are hardier. Crayfish feed on living and dead animals and plants.The name ""crayfish"" comes from the Old French word escrevisse (Modern French écrevisse). The word has been modified to ""crayfish"" by association with ""fish"" (folk etymology). The largely American variant ""crawfish"" is similarly derived.Some kinds of crayfish are known locally as lobsters, crawdads, mudbugs, and yabbies. In the Eastern United States, ""crayfish"" is more common in the north, while ""crawdad"" is heard more in central and southwestern regions, and ""crawfish"" further south, although there are considerable overlaps.The study of crayfish is called astacology.In Australia (on the eastern seaboard), New Zealand and South Africa, the term crayfish or cray generally refers to a saltwater spiny lobster, of the genus Jasus that is indigenous to much of southern Oceania, while the freshwater species are usually called yabby or kōura, from the indigenous Australian and Māori names for the animal respectively, or by other names specific to each species. Exceptions included Western Rock Lobster of the Palinuridae family found on the west coast of Australia; from the Parastacidae family Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish found only in Tasmania, and the Murray crayfish found on Australia's Murray River.In Singapore, the term crayfish typically refers to Thenus orientalis, a seawater crustacean from the slipper lobster family. True crayfish are not native to Singapore, but are commonly found as pets, or as an invasive species (Cherax quadricarinatus) in the many water catchment areas, and are alternatively known as freshwater lobsters."

Putt-Putt has all sorts of valuable lessons to dole out upon unworthy ears willing to shell out a gold coin or two just to listen through a rusty keyhole.

If it weren't for Putt-Putt Joins the Parade, the 90's would be short one very creative game company.But my inner cynic can't be contained! I must be negative!I didn't like Putt-Putt. Well, to be fair, I never enjoyed Putt-Putt, even as a kid. The one I played the most was Putt-Putt Travels Through Time, and even then I knew it was for very superficial reasons. The only exposure I've had to this Putt-Putt entry, was from PBG's comedic review of it.What I didn't realize, however, was that the original box art for this game draws Putt-Putt in a distinctly different way than the later entries had him drawn. It's creepy. Look it up at your own expense.Well, enough beating around the bush. Let's dig into this game, and see what comes out!Ugh... I feel disgusting...Putt-Putt Joins the Parade starts with Putt-Putt waking up in his usual car-themed world, to discover from his slightly-pedophilic friend, Smokey the Firetruck, that there is- indeed- a parade going on in Car Town. How Putt-Putt didn't know this prior to that day, I'll never know. Smokey tells Putt-Putt, he'll need to make some money to take a car wash, get a puppy, and get a balloon to join in the parade. Groundbreaking storytelling, as you can see. Even at their inception, Humongous was always at the head of telling the most complex, intriguing stories in their kids' games.The gameplay is very simple. If you've played ANY Humongous game before this, you'll immediately know what to do. Even if you don't, you can figure it out quickly. The puzzles aren't challenging, the story doesn't have much of a drive since it has all the emotion and weight of a Saturday morning toddler's cartoon, and the extra features in the world like making money and changing your paint colors wear out quickly, because the options to do other things are few and far between, and make for a very vapid world. A colorful and charming world, but vapid all the same.I was constantly thinking during my 30 minutes playthrough about how many more improvements Humongous made to their games AFTER Putt-Putt, and how much more fun they were because of them. The larger worlds, better-crafted stories, and more options for different playthroughs. When you play Putt-Putt once, that's it. There are no alternates to the things you find. So, as you can imagine, the replay value is incredibly low.I was also think about how slow the damned game is. Putt-Putt moves at just the right speed to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, that you'll sight as you wait for him to finally get to the other bloody side of the road/town/wherever the hell he is. You can skip the walk animation in other Humongous games, and to not have that ability in their original was jarring... and a big pace-slower for the majority of the game.I don't hate Putt-Putt. I'm actually quite apathetic about it. It was short, dull, and painless. I'd say that's fine for a game, but I prefer it if a game actually sucks me into its world and makes me interested, like in Pajama Sam or Spy Fox 3. While they weren't perfect games, I could respect them for the drive in their plots that made me want to succeed. You could write off Putt-Putt as being imperfect because it's ""just a kid's game"", but I judge all media with the same standard. And Putt-Putt Joins the Parade was just... boring and done quickly. I'm giving it a 4/10."

There's a fun story, and it CAN be challenging for the little tots, but I think someone who is five or six can figure them out. :) I recommend this game. (Add me on Steam! ThatsPandaGirl )"

This along with Freddie the Fish was what I grew up on, and if I ever have kids, I hope this is the first game I introduce him or her to.One tip is that you need to press F5 to bring up the menu options to close out of the game, or you can beat the game (~15 or so minutes if you rush through it) and click the no face, and it will close out by itself.  I'm sure on Windows you can Alt-Tab out of it, but it doesn't work on Linux (at least on my distribution), so you need to press F5 to exit the game."

This really got me immersed into the world of Putt-Putt and made the time I played this game the best 34 minutes I've ever had in my entire life. I'd definitely share this to my kids when i grow older. All though the visuals and the exploration were clearly this game's main focus I did have a few issues with this game. As you may of known this game was incredibly hyped up at E3 2016 showing off much more then what was given on release, but that doesn't make this a bad game. So all in all I thoroughly enjoyed this game start to finish, can't wait for D.L.C. continuing the story or even a sequel!  -SomeOrdinaryMutaharsFinal Verdict: 35.2 / 100"

You need to lower down the screen resolution of your screen monitor.  And in some cases, reduced color most notable on windows 10 and mac os 10.12. Like I side before with my old review I advised scumm vm 1.9 for these systems. other then that enjoy.Old reviewfor people running windows 10 scumm vm 1.7 might cross on certen configuration. if this happens just download scumm vm 1.9 from herehttp://www.scummvm.org/downloadThis is humongous first game that has graphical & wide screen issues on newer monitors. This does not have any debugging material. Or any leftover codes like games after Putt Putt saves the zoo. I advised not running this on nvidia, instead default with Intel hd graphics 4000 or bitter for best experience.1.	Left click then right on Intel Graphics settings2.	settings,3.	 display4.	change maintain display scaling with scale full screen5.	force override Application settingsMy advisement is don't buy this game unloose you knew how to lower your screen settings. Or after the biggest nostalgia of your life. I would recommend it, if was more updated? this game uses scummvm that is a remaster of scumm. other than issues with widescreen for not having 1:6 support unlike humongous games after 1995 (that is responsible to prevent the game of going fuzzy or stretch by making two black bars from left and right of your desktop monitor. now 15 years out of date so i can't fault it. other than that this is stall a great game. of what it has?This is about, when putt-putt first finds his dog pep from the cave so that putt putt can.  Join the dog competition.  It does however influence kids that you have to have money to compete unless in this one scene that he steels a magnet even claims he lost it (that might give the kids a wrong massage). With a simple car or pant job; the player needs to found groceries or need to mow you neighbors’ guess. So, without putt putt being clean. He will be filthy. That means no job= cannot be successful in real life."
