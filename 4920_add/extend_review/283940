,Recommended,283940,13199635,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,RPINerd,"During the late 90’s/early 2000’s Humongous Entertainment released an absolutely fantastic stream of “edutainment” point and click adventures for children. These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.If I recall correctly, I didn’t get into Freddi Fish until I had already become fairly invested in Putt-Putt. Because of this, I don’t have the same nostalgic tie to the franchise. That being said, there are still scenes of this game that upon replaying, were as vivid in my mind as the day I first played them. The Missing Kelp Seeds was the first Freddi Fish game I played and I enjoyed it immensely. The change in scenery helped keep me engaged and also broadened my academic interests as a child."

But it turns out that all the weed plants have been destroyed and the seeds for new ones stolen by a rival gang of sharks lead by none other than Cthulhu himself. Since your grandmother is to old to head out to the field on her own you are the only one who can retrieve them! You must venture out and save your Ocean drug cartel and defeat Cthulhu once and for all!You're not alone on this difficult quest though as you have your sidekick crack dealer and childhood friend Martin Luther by your side.Still, the game is wonderful and i'm surprised that this was the type of game you got included with your ceral back in the day.Pros-Orchestrated soundtrack by James Horner-Challenging puzzles-Great voice acting by people such as Danny DeVito, George Bush and Sharlie Sheen as the main role of Freddi-Deep and grim story written by Stephen King-Well detailed and interactive environments-Large open world sandbox (its the god-damn ocean afterall)-More action than all of Michael Bay's movies combinedCons-Fairly short."

I remember running this gem of a game on my old Windows 95 computer. Oh, how the time flies. At the time, I was so in love with this game. I was a very young child then, so, the nostalgia factor is extremely strong here. Now that I'm older and have played it again, it has certainly taken me back to my childhood. Are the graphics and effects all that great? Nah, but, that is to be expected of early 90s games. I guess you could say that this was the computer game that started my PC gaming addiction for me. Kids nowadays probably won't appreciate this game all that much, considering that they have been spoiled by modern day games with crisp and HD graphics. I think that us 90s babies are the ones who will appreciate this game the most."

While there, she learns that her grandma's kelp seeds have been stolen! Freddi sets out with her best friend Luther to find the culprits and restore the seeds to their rightful owner.The GameplayFFaTCotMKS is a point and click game designed for younger children. The resulting gameplay is simplistic but intuitive. Puzzles tend to fall into theuse this to do thiscategory, which is fine. I completed the game in about 40 minutes, but I expect it to take a bit longer if you choose to explore the areas more thoroughly. I liked it, though it may not be enjoyable for everyone. It is very easy, after all.The CharactersFreddi is a very brave and conscientious role model for children. She pays proper respect to her elders and does her best to set things right. I found it very difficult to be interested in Luther, however. He barely helps beyond asking meaningless questions and is seemingly only after the kelp seeds for his own benefit (despite being reprimanded by Freddi several times). However, his antics make him an interesting foil to Freddi and her grounded disposition. Still, he felt unnecessary and I personally didn't like having him around.The side characters give the game an atmospheric quality that I enjoyed as a child and continue to enjoy as an adult. Their colorful personalities are memorable beyond the confines of their limited time on screen. Interactions with them are simple and genuine, and an enjoyable aspect of the experience. I chuckled a few times at the villains' dialogue, especially.The SettingFFaTCotMKS takes place underwater. It appears to be the ocean, but it could be a sea or some other large body of water, as it is never explicitly stated.I liked the variety inherent in the different environments. The world is well populated and immersive, and there are a TON of things to click on in every screen of the game. Colorful little creatures bounce around, a starfish teaches you basic math, pearls shine and an opera fish performs a solo. It's worth exploring every inch just to see what crazy thing will happen next! These fun little events are synonymous with Humongous Entertainment's early point and click offerings, and they help bring the world to life.The GraphicsThe game has a very charming, almost handdrawn look to it (forgive me if the art actually IS handdrawn, I'm not very proficient at spotting the difference). The graphics are endearing and vibrant while simultaneously giving off the look of a cartoon. It's fun to look at and even runs in widescreen!Character designs themselves aren't incredibly impressive, but their personalities more than make up for any obvious deficiencies.The SoundThe music is serviceable and ambient, but not very memorable. The sound effects, on the other hand, are abuzz with life. You'll recognize many reused sound effects if you've played any other Humongous Entertainment games, and I guarantee they'll put a smile on your face.The VerdictI wholeheartedly recommend Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds. It's chock-full of educational and humorous content for younger minds. It looks and feels like an interactive animated television show, it has a strong identity and an altruistic endgame, but, most of all, it does exactly what it sets out to do: provide a meaningful experience. I think it's definitely worth a buy, though I'd recommend purchasing a reduced price. 7 dollars might be too much to some people for the amount of content you're provided.I give Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds9.5 out of 10purple sea urchins."

I always used to play it and it felt fantastic getting my hands on it.So Freddi Fish and The Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds is about a female fish called Freddi and her friend Linus on a quest to find Freddi's grandmother's kelp seeds that was stolen from her backyard. At the start you get some items to help you on your adventure. You will then go to an epic quest to distant land and track down items that may help your advance through the vast lands of the sea. You will also have to help people along the way in order to continue adventuring.So, do i recommend it? Of course i do, i used to play it when i was very young and it gave me a great feeling to explore and complete the game again as i've done so many years ago. Even if you've never played it it is still worth a try, trust me. The game is very humorous (at least in my opinion) and there's alot to discover by clicking around on a few objects.So all in all, a good game worth the money in my opinion."

While the game can be completed in only an hour, It's one of the most nostalgic hours of my life. But, a review isn't based on nostalgia alone. Let us talk about the actual game.StoryStory wise, Grandma Grouper has lost her Kelp Seeds, which she shares to feed all undersea life. You are Freddi, and with the help of your best friend, Luther, you are tasked with finding the lost 'treasure'. But watch out! The Squid Father and his shark goons are also after the seeds! Talking to, helping, and interacting with the undersea life is the only way to reach your goal, but you better hurry!While a simple kids story, this game does it exceptionally well. I never once felt interaction was forced. Everyone seemed to know Freddi in some way or another, but that doesn't de-value the interaction. While I did beat the game, I didn't obtain enough sea-urchins to enter the undersea volcano, which will send me back one day to find out its mysteries.GameplayThe game plays as you would expect a point-and-click game to play. While you move around the world, you are set to be in one area, while finding things around the world to interact with. It plays fantastically, but at times, the object you are looking for may be too well hidden, and blends into the background a little too easily.Voice ActingThis is possibly themajor faultwith the game. While some people are voiced decently (The Eel, Stingray, Pirate), others seem like a very odd choice. For example, giving the Crab a French accent is a little weird, and at times, Freddi would sound disinterested in what is happening. While this isn't such a huge deal, it still takes it out of the experience.I PERSONALLYgive it a pass, solely on the reason this is a childrens game built in 1994. And not just a childrens game, ayoungchildrens game. I just let it pass, but it is a negative point.OVERALL SCOREFreddi fish is an awesome game, more so for children and the nostalgic. With a good story, math and mini-games, it's awesome to help a developing mind along.STORY7/10GAMEPLAY8/10VOICE ACTORS4/10OVERALL7/10Yes, it has it's problems, as all games do, but it handles them well, and keeps the whole experience enjoyable."

Only about an hour's gameplay for adults and that's because of the time it takes to go from one screen to the next etc etc. Play it for Nostalgia's sake, but unless you have kids who can get more out of this than you can, don't pay full price. Wait until it's on sale."

It's perfect if you got a child of your own and want them to experience the same feeling for game as you did as a kid, or just keep them busy for a while, haha. It got a lovely story with math problems, puzzles and I remember thinking it was kinda tricky! I asked my parents a few times, haha.

Back in 1996, my parents bought me this classic point-and-click when I was 2 years old. Suffice to say, it isn't all that fantastic as a game, but it is still a great way to kill time. The game features a goldfish named Freddi, and a green guppy, Luther, as they embark on a quest to find her grandmother's treasure chest. This game's art style is very colorful and wacky, while the backdrops illuminate under the shimmering ocean surface. The music definitely gives me that summer vibe as Freddi visits various locations such as a beach, a junkyard, and even a king's castle. There are loads of things to click on in the back ground and foreground. Since this is a game for very small audiences I can imagine that this serves as a simulator for waving one's keys. Aside from that the character's dialogue is very tounge and cheek. I forgot how amusing those mafia sharks were in the cutscenes. The game even has section dedicated to teaching mathematics, which is probably the reason I'm so good with math now! All in all, Freddi Fish is a cute, fun exploration game, but would not recommend to an audience who never grew up with any of these games. For the kiddies and for those who have fond memories, this one's a real treat as it is loaded with various things to do, despite it being a game that will last a couple of hours maximum."

Anyways before Spongebob & Finding Nemo exsisted, kids in the 90's only had this or Disney's Little Mermaid for undersea entertainment. Freddi Fish is a kind hearted fish who does good deeds to win the trust and respect of others. One day her grandmother's kelp seeds went missing and it is up to Freddi and her friend Luther to solve the mystery of the missing kelp seeds by going on an adventure. This was Humongous Entertainment's first game to use traditional 2-D animation for the gameplay and FMV sequences rather than the pixelated texture used in their older games. With a cast of colorful characters, interative background, and great voice acting from Annette Toutonghi(Penelope from the Sly Cooper games and Spinkle from Pajama Sam 3). Freddi Fish will be an instant favorite for kids and adults alike."

Well, I played that incredibly short demo that came with other Humongous games, but that was it until I decided to purchase the full game on sale and give it a try. I had a good time playing it (though I wish I could have experienced it as a kid.)Freddi Fish 1 was Humongous' first game to use hand-drawn animation instead of pixel art, so that's something I admire it for, but that and its age (pre-Windows 95) mean that it isn't as refined or advanced as its sequels, though I like the retro charm it has. The animation and art are generally pretty good. The weak point is probably Freddi and Luther, who look very different here than in later games. They're drawn differently on most screens, usually looking okay, but sometimes very awkward or even terrible (Luther, especially, can look atrocious on some screens.)One thing about this game is that it has a sort of sober atmosphere. The music, which is excellent by the way, has some very somber tracks and the graphics tend to be rather dark and muted. The game's premise is also serious: you're on a mission to prevent mass starvation. Of course, there's plenty of bright, cheery characters and fun, colorful animations, so it's not a dark or depression game, but it's definitely the most somber Freddi Fish game. The game also has villains (two bumbling Mafia sharks and the Squidfather) and I hate these characters. A Godfather parody could work in Spy Fox, but it's totally out of place in this series. I can't for the life of me understand why they reused these same villains for Freddi Fish 2.Overall, this is a good though dated children's game and if you want to introduced a child to this series, I'd recommend starting with this one."
