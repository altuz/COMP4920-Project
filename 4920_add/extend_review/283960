As a little kid, I never realized how spooky this game was until now. Darkness is probably the best boss battle I've seen, but be warned, do not play this game alone in the dark. You must have good observation skills to locate all of Sam's socks and you also make new friends along the way like Otto the boat who has a negative outlook on life and a cool accent. Try not to rage when the purple dancing couch doesn't get off your mask though. Not only is this game a spooky and fun past time, but I also learned about gysers and physics. Pajama Sam weighs less than 3 rocks so we needed 3 rocks in the opposite basket to lift Sam in his basket to get us into the house that Darkness lives in. I'm confident in physics now thanks to this game! From learning strategies like getting a slab of wood with a rope to mining gold in a much more fun way than Minecraft, this is a fun game to play, despite how scary it gets at times. 12/10 would play again."

Chronicling a young boy's hallucinations as he descends into insanity, this game provides an unforgiving look at the dark side of human nature. It explores concepts that other games are simply unwilling to touch such as the dark side of capitalism (the bridge), police brutality (the trees), and humanity's desire to destroy what it does not understand (Sam's quest to defeat darkness). In an age of big budget games that err on the side of political correctness and mass appeal, this classic title is truly a breath of fresh air."

I could go as far to say that I could honestly hear this music playing in a Queen album, and I have said such things.The art in this masterpiece was truly before it's time, with backgrounds and sprites so elegantly drawn, you could mistake them for levels in a PS4 game, and it would have to be a superb PS4 game.I honestly cannot say a single bad thing about this game, it is the portrait of perfection, just as all the other brilliant works of Humongous Entertainment, though, this one takes the cake. Pajama Sam is without a doubt, the most atmospheric, challenging, hilarious, thrilling experience you will ever face in life, you will see the face of your first-born child sleeping in your arms, and you will think ""Man, I should be playing Pajama Sam right now"".I highly suggest playing this game late in your life, because once you finish this, you will have felt every single level of every single emotion ever existed and more, nothing will ever satisfy your new-found standards after playing this love-child of beauty and genius.Buy this game.10/10Better than The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time."

76561197989271430,Recommended,283960,33358365,Posted: 7 July,all,Mark Y.,"A great game for the young or young at heart, and in its own way, a sad testament to how the adventure genre has declined.After playing Primordia and Loom with my five year old, I set out to find another suitable adventure game.  Pajama Sam's reviews have the unfortunately quality of seeming like ironical memes, so I was somewhat skeptical when grabbing them.  I'm glad I overcame my trepidation because the series -- particularly the first game -- is excellent.Basically, Pajama Sam is a pared-down point-and-click with wonderfully animated Saturday-morning-cartoon graphics and a story pitched at young children.  Despite the game's being aimed at children, there is enough cleverness in the writing -- and strangeness in the world -- that an adult can enjoy its content.While Pajama Sam is ""pared down"" in comparison to Monkey Island and King's Quest V, it is considerably more complicated than most of what passes for adventure games today.  The world is larger; the puzzles are more varied (employing a mix of inventory, logic, and observational puzzles); and there is a generous helping of the kind of extra content familiar from old games: the rooms are full of hotspots that provide amusing interactions.The game also has a host of optional content, and every time you play the world is slightly randomized, with certain puzzles only appearing in certain games, certain areas having different significance, and certain items being moved about.  This is an odd choice because the game is not particularly replayable and there is no choice in which puzzles you get -- you might play again and have the exact same distribution of content and items -- but it is an interesting novelty all the same.In short, this is a lovingly made and endearing game perfectly suited for kids who are learning to love adventures.  It would make an excellent entry point to the genre, one that would set them on the path of the puzzle-oriented classics, rather than in the direction of the narrative-choice model that currently prevails."

An interesting feature is that the game will change a little the next time you play it. The changes are not huge though but enough to have you play the game multiple times. An example of one of the changes is being able to acess a room that was blocked off before. In this way you will be given new puzzles that were not present in the previous playthough. It is things like this that make this game great. The game isn't super long but its replay value makes up for it. The story is good enough albeit peculiar.

The third was themed around food. The second took place in The Factory Wehere They Makes The Weather, although it wasn't too tightly themed - the board of directors consists of anthropomorphic boards. And then there's this one. In the Land of Darkness, it's always night... and that's it. Everything else is basically random anthropomorics objects (and a rodent clown) and a landscape that feels like it was pulled out of a 50's adventure comic.

The content is humorous, the world is filled to brim with imagination, and the story will certainly entertain.That aside, the only difference I noticed in this version compared to the CD release was the addition of subtitles. I think the subtitles were added because the audio is unusually poor for the dialogue, but it's certainly still understandable (though the subtitles are poorly implemented). It has a bit of a static background to it. You can also pause the game entirely with the Spacebar.That aside, this game is perfect for the nostalgia factor, or for a young child."

Beat it again and again and made us smarter in a way. Pajama Sam: No Need To Hide When It's Dark Outside is the most cleverly written children's game I've ever played. It also looks charming, has a great soundtrack, and three different routes each time you start from the beginning. It's enjoyable for kids and adults, and you won't regret giving it a try.A key element for any children’s adventure game is voice acting – if the performances aren’t engaging, it’s likely that interest will be lost quickly. Thankfully, every moment you spend with these characters is a delight thanks to the brilliant and varied voices. Ranging from Sam’s high and chirpy voice to Otto’s hesitant and slightly wary style to the quiz show door’s enthusiastic zeal, each actor injects a highly distinctive personality into their respective roles. The music complements this perfectly, with upbeat tunes keeping the mood light while mixing in the occasional chime to add an unearthly air. Music even takes part in the game itself, with furniture dancing in secret and kitchen appliances singing about their functions.The trees are just a sample of the unusual characters that will make an appearance. Sam is the only human (if you can call him that) in this world, an innocent and friendly young boy who is keen to assist others. Along the way he’ll encounter a toaster, a coat stand and a fridge, to name but a few of the everyday items that have come to life. The most memorable are Otto the boat and King the mine cart, both of whom you’ll help out with their troubles. They act as modes of transport, and thus you’ll spend more time connecting with them than anyone else. It’s a shame other minor characters don’t play a bigger role, because everyone has a unique personality (such as the carrot trying to rescue his friends from being used in a salad and the over-worked water well) and I’d have liked to interact more with this colourfully assorted cast."

,Recommended,283960,29210872,Posted: 12 January,all,exucapp,"Literally one of the best point and click games of all time.Of course, this game this meant for young children(I played it endlessly as one)so how could this be?Pajama Sam finds that increasingly rare line where children's entertainment is balanced with subtle wit and humor that appeals to adults. A lot of the humor in the game I really didn't catch until I was older due to it's clever word play. I would go so far as to call this the Disney of point and click games.The story is simple; yet very charming. Every character is interesting and full of personality. More personality than I would say a lot of current gen games have. The other thing that makes this so great is that Sam can interact with a lot of the characters, typically in multiple ways. The continuations of the dialog may not always serve a purpose, but it is definitely entertaining!The puzzles in this game are pretty basic, yet satisfying. Nothing is ever really unclear and if you missed something or messed up, it's because you didn't look closely enough. There are, however, a few multistep puzzles that can get tricky if you aren't paying attention. I think it goes without saying that all of the puzzles are geared towards kids, so if you want something that won't be too difficult for them, this is a great choice. Definitely not as challenging as some of the Spy Fox ones were.The other highlight of this is game is that is truly does look wonderful! To be honest, I don't really feel that the art has aged too much here. It's still incredibly vibrant and Humongous did an exceptional job in making sure that every screen really has a unique feel to it, which makes it easy to remember where you have and have not been.Maybe I wear the nostalgia goggles when it comes to this game, but it was an absolute blast when I was a kid and I still go back to enjoy it now.Thanks Humongous."

I was really worried that this game wouldn't hold up as well, playing it as an adult, but I can say that I still enjoyed the humor and the characters. Some of the animations might be a little dated, but what do you expect it's from 1996 (God I'm old). I had so much fun, I might just check out the other Pajama Sam games that are now available, as this was the only one I played as a kid.Pajama Sam: NNHWIDO has basically an Alice in Wonderland-type story. Pajama Sam gets transported to the Land of Darkness through his bedroom closet, and goes on a journey through the land to vanquish Darkness, the character whom the land is so aptly named after. It's pretty simple, but that's really all it needs to be. The real focus is the humor and characters and both are just filled with so much charm. There's the boat who's afraid of water, the old mine car who's become rusted to the tracks, and the (literal) wishing well, who makes wishes when you throw him a penny. Yeah, this game's pretty weird, but that's what makes it so fun.Like I said earlier practically everything in the game reacts to you clicking it, usually in more ways than one. One item may have multiple comedic reactions to you clicking on it. Seriously try and click everything in this game, even stuff in the background that just looks like it's part of the environment. I discovered some clickables playing the game now, that I never found as a kid.This game also has surprising replay value. There will often be different parts of the environment generated in future playthroughs that replace some from previous playthroughs. These add more to the game; more jokes, more story, more characters.Even if you aren't a kid check this game out, it's still pretty entertaining as an adult, plus it's fairly priced. It kind of reminds me of watching some of the old Cartoon Network shows I grew up with as a kid, it may be kind of old, but it's still fun. Check it out if you've got 7 dollars to spare."

You may need to spend some times figuring out the controls, but it's easy once you get the hang of it. The game isn't that long either. You can get through it in about 2 hours or less without even trying that hard. But, Pajama Sam has an old school sense of humor. (Read: Actually funny.) Unlike other kid games or movies that are just dumb, Pajama Sam can be actually funny, with a great attention to detail.Even though the game graphics are WAY out of date and you can see the pixels, it still has an odd charm.Pajama Sam is the only game in which you can lead a carrot rebellion, answer questions about World Leaders, and beat a toaster in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.I recommend it if you can spend some money on a VERY short game. And if you want more milleages out of it? Maybe you should livestream it. I'm sure a lot of people will have a good laugh."

And funny seeing as how this kid is a fan of some comic book hero who goes around fighting crime, in his pajamas. As story wise, it's the classic, overcoming your fear of the darkness story. Sam, or Pajama Sam as he calls himself, travels to the Land of Darkness only to loose his stuff that he needs to fight Darkness. Now he needs to find them with the help of a western minecart named The King and a peter lory sounding boat named Auto. It was fun going back to this, everything is how I remembered. I only had one problem where I clicked on somthing and the animation wouldn't stop and I was stuck so I had to reset, too bad there ain't no save feature but then again it's a short game. So yeah, I was happy in seeing this game on Steam and was able to re-live part of my childhood, clicking on almost everything to make weird stuff happen, collecting socks, solving puzzles and of course a good ol fashion game of Cheese and Crackers."

""Dude? For real? You're favorite games are The Last of Us and Spec Ops: The Line! Those games are INTENSE! And you're suggesting a kid's educational game from the 90's belongs up at the top of the list with some of the greatest games ever?""In my opinion? Yeah.See, Pajama Sam was a game DESIGNED for kids, but the developers had enough mind to add enough humor that only adults would get. I'm not saying there are any sex jokes, and there aren't, but there are plenty of jokes that I know would go over most kids' heads. The game is also much more maturely designed. Of all of the Humongous Games, you mainly are told specifically what to do (Spy Fox, Freddi Fish), or you meet completely foolish characters that tell you what they need but are more than capable of getting the job done themselves (Putt Putt). But Pajama Sam did something different... it plays with empathy. Think about it. You run into situations, and mainly Sam reacts to the situation or you- the player- does. Otto can't go out on the river, just as he can't move along the land since he's a boat. The King can't move because he's rusted to the track. For the few seconds you speak with each character, you feel sorry for their problems (mainly Otto's stupidity) and solve them yourself.The game also does incredibly well with it's design. The artwork is beautiful to look at, and the way each frame is shot to emphasize different perspectives and imply you can move in different directions makes the game very clear and concise. It's not like some point-and-click games where you stumbled across a door fifteen times and didn't notice it till you looked up the FAQ on the game. And, yes, the game is simple. It is easy. But, like I once told my ex, it doesn't have to be hard to be good. The voice acting is decent. as are all the sound effects, and the music is very ambient and creates a lively atmosphere.The game revolves around a large puzzle for one of your three lost items, and each item has two randomly-selected puzzles that can be mixed and matched any which was, creating a lot of different ""games"" for you to play through. Of course, I got each different puzzle for the missing items after playing three times. But with this, and the 20 missing socks you can find, Pajama Sam could take up roughly 2-3 hours for you to play in its entirety, where you can take 40 minutes of your day to sit down and relax to the Land of Darkness.Pajama Sam may not look like much, but of all the old point-and-click games I've played as a child, this one certainly has a lot more substance to it. There were the second and third official ones (we don't talk about the fourth), but the first one really got a strong identity for the character of Pajama Sam and his world of imagination. It's no masterpiece, and I'll never try to sell it like it is, but it is really, really, really good. It's a lot better than a lot of games I've played out there. Granted, it may not be for everyone, but it still is worth checking out for anyone looking for a very unique video game."

,Recommended,283960,29893609,Posted: 12 February,all,mineturte,"TODAY it seems to me providential that Fate should have chosen Braunau on the Inn as my birthplace. For this little town lies on the boundary between two German states which we of the younger generation at least have made it our life work to reunite by every means at our disposal.German-Austria must return to the great German mother country, and not because of any economic considerations. No, and again no: even if such a union were unimportant from an economic point of view; yes, even if it were harmful, it must nevertheless take place. One blood demands one Reich. Never will the German nation possess the moral right to engage in colonial politics until, at least, it embraces its own sons within a single state. Only when the Reich borders include the very last German, but can no longer guarantee his daily bread, will the moral right to acquire foreign soil arise from the distress of our own people. Their sword will become our plow, and from the tears of war the daily bread of future generations will grow. And so this little city on the border seems to me the symbol of a great mission. And in another respect as well, it looms as an admonition to the present day. More than a hundred years ago, this insignificant place had the distinction of being immortalized in the annals at least of German history, for it was the scene of a tragic catastrophe which gripped the entire German nation. At the time of our fatherland's deepest humiliation, Johannes Palm of Nuremberg, burgher, bookseller, uncompromising nationalist and French hater, died there for the Germany which he loved so passionately even in her misfortune. He had stubbornly refused to denounce his accomplices who were in fact his superiors. In thus he resembled Leo Schlageter. And like him, he was denounced to the French by a representative of his government An Augsburg police chief won this unenviable fame, thus furnishing an example for our modern German officials in Herr Severing's Reich.In this little town on the Inn, gilded by the rays of German martyrdom, Bavarian by blood, technically Austrian, lived my parents in the late eighties of the past century; my father a dutiful civil servants my mother giving all her being to the household, and devoted above all to us children in eternal, loving care Little remains in my memory of this period, for after a few years my father had to leave the little border city he had learned to love, moving down the Inn to take a new position in Passau, that is, in Germany proper.In those days constant moving was the lot of an Austrian customs official. A short time later, my father was sent to Linz, and there he was finally pensioned. Yet, indeed, this was not to mean ""res""' for the old gentleman. In his younger days, as the son of a poor cottager, he couldn't bear to stay at home. Before he was even thirteen, the little boy laced his tiny knapsack and ran away from his home in the Waldviertel. Despite the at tempts of 'experienced' villagers to dissuade him, he made his way to Vienna, there to learn a trade. This was in the fifties of the past century. A desperate decision, to take to the road with only three gulden for travel money, and plunge into the unknown. By the time the thirteen-year-old grew to be seventeen, he had passed his apprentice's examination, but he was not yet content. On the contrary. The long period of hardship, endless misery, and suffering he had gone through strengthened his determination to give up his trade and become ' something better. Formerly the poor boy had regarded the priest as the embodiment of all humanly attainable heights; now in the big city, which had so greatly widened his perspective, it was the rank of civil servant. With all the tenacity of a young man whom suffering and care had made 'old' while still half a child, the seventeen-year-old clung to his new decision-he did enter the civil service. And after nearly twenty-three years, I believe, he reached his goal. Thus he seemed to have fulfilled a vow which he had made as a poor boy: that he would not return to his beloved native village until he had made something of himself.His goal was achieved; but no one in the village could remember the little boy of former days, and to him the village had grown strange.When finally, at the age of fifty-six, he went into retirement, he could not bear to spend a single day of his leisure in idleness. Near the Upper Austrian market village of Lambach he bought a farm, which he worked himself, and thus, in the circuit of a long and industrious life, returned to the origins of his forefathers.It was at this time that the first ideals took shape in my breast. All my playing about in the open, the long walk to school, and particularly my association with extremely 'husky' boys, which sometimes caused my mother bitter anguish, made me the very opposite of a stay-at-home. And though at that time I scarcely had any serious ideas as to the profession I should one day pursue, my sympathies were in any case not in the direction of my father's career. I believe that even then my oratorical talent was being developed in the form of more or less violent arguments with my schoolmates. I had become a little ringleader; at school I learned easily and at that time very well, but was otherwise rather hard to handle. Since in my free time I received singing lessons in the cloister at Lambach, I had excellent opportunity to intoxicate myself with the solemn splendor of the brilliant church festivals. As was only natural the abbot seemed to me, as the village priest had once seemed to my father, the highest and most desirable ideal. For a time, at least, this was the case. But since my father, for understandable reasons, proved unable to appreciate the oratorical talents of his pugnacious boy, or to draw from them any favorable conclusions regarding the future of his offspring, he could, it goes without saying, achieve no understanding for such youthful ideas. With concern he observed this conflict of nature.As it happened, my temporary aspiration for this profession was in any case soon to vanish, making place for hopes more stated to my temperament. Rummaging through my father's library, I had come across various books of a military nature among them a popular edition of the Franco-German War of 1870-7I It consisted of two issues of an illustrated periodical from those years, which now became my favorite reading matter It was not long before the great heroic struggle had become my greatest inner experience. From then on I became more and more enthusiastic about everything that was in any way connected with war or, for that matter, with soldieringBut in another respect as well, this was to assume importance for me. For the first time, though as yet in a confused form, the question was forced upon my consciousness: Was there a difference -and if so what difference-between the Germans who fought these battles and other Germans? Why hadn't Austria taken part in this war; why hadn't my father and all the others fought?Are we not the same as all other Germans?Do we not all belong together? This problem began to gnaw at my little brain for the first time. I asked cautious questions and with secret envy received the answer that not every German was fortunate enough to belong to Bismarck's Reich..This was more than I could understand."

Just like I remember it, the game is an excellent point-and-click adventure, one that you can play over and over thanks to the main 3 items randomly changing locations. I always loved this feature, because every time you start anew, you have to solve different puzzles to beat the game, rewarding each replay with variety. Sure, I hold this game on the nostalgic pedestal a bit, but not without good reason.Now about the Steam version: I'm a bit disappointed. I've ran my original copy in the Scumm engine before and reached the same performance differences here: voice dialogue loads faster then normal, so characters talking in cutscenes sound like they don't take a break to breathe and just go into the next sentence. Here and there I see animations changed or cut out altogether, particularly during the intro dialogue with King where he says ""Loop-de-Loops"" and his face doesn't move. The game is still fully playable, but these emulation problems still got to me. It would be unreasonable to recommend getting an original copy and seeing for yourself, as this game was designed for Windows '95 and the like; the game would most certainly not work without a virtual machine. Even still, if you remember this game, played it or not, this purchase it still worth it."

,Recommended,283960,22311110,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,"Kill me, Charlize","Story: One of the most well known aspects of Pajama Sam is it's story; it is simply unorthodox, as it does the process of not feeding all of the story the viewer; it drip-feeds it, giving the viewer only half the story, or sometimes giving scenes without any context. For some games, this would be a disaster waiting to happen, but in the case of Pajama Sam, this is done almost consistently masterfully, holding back information on such subjects such as the location of the flashlight or what color an orange is. Many have critisized the holding of frames later in the series, but taken into the context of the fact they were running out of money to make the game, is is understandable.For many fans, their major criticism of the game is the handling of the ending, which many consider far too 'out there' and simply crap. I too, am not a huge fan of the ending, but taking the ending to the game, inside the context of the 'true' ending sequel, Pajama Sam 3: You are what you Eat from your Head to your Feet, the ending can make a lot more sense, and thus I enjoy it far, far more. To stop me from ranting on for ages, Pajama Sam's story is a master stroke in writing, one which has been a hard feat to replicate.Art and Sound: I was introduced to Pajama Sam through the in-progress tetraology of games, The Rebuild of Pajama Sam; due to this, I became used to the cutting edge graphics employed for the higher-budget games. And to be honest, yes, the original game's art is beginning to show it's age 20 years on; however, this does not detract from the series in any major capcity, as the art compliments the anime extremely well.The sound is also fantastic, and a very high-point for the show. Excellent music is employed to showcase the chaos of finding your lost socks, and for darker moments such as the internal struggles of the main cast of the game. Some of Beethoven's music is featured later in the series, which coupled with the emotional impact of the scene, produces one of the most excellent scenes in video game history.Characters: By a massive leap, the highlight of the series. Pajama Sam features in it's story the struggles of the main characters, to devastatingly wonderful effect. Weak, timid, daddy-issues Sam, to powerful, arrogant, egotistical Mom, to the quiet, mysterious Boat, and the brooding, apparently agnostical Darkness, Pajama Sam develes into the mind and motivations of these characters, showcasing exactly what makes them tick, and this is what gives us some of gaming's most regonisable and wonderful characters.I am certain entire essays have been written on why certain charcters tick, and that's another reason so many of these characters are so wonderful. Fans are so devoted to their favorite characters (personally I am partial to Mom and Boat), and this creates a wonderful feeling when learning about these characters and then discussing this with other fans. Generally, Pajama Sam employs some of the most human characters in games, showing us that the heroes of gaming aren't always strong, both mentally and physically, or not even in control of their lives.In closing, Pajama Sam is one of the strongest games ever produced. It employs powerful characters, a deep, deep story, and art that has only just began to show it's age. What makes the game's longevity even more powerful is that even now on sites such as PJSamGeeks people are still analysing this series, trying to know everything about it. I hope Pajama Sam will live on in the hearts of it's fans, who'll continue to appreciate it's deep, metaphorical story. I hope that Pajama Sam will always remain an game that will be treasured, for all the ages."

He is trying to conquer his fear of darkness and defeat the physical representation of him with his special flashlight and lunchbox, but trees steal them almost as soon as you enter the closet. You must find your lunchbox and flashlight, help a boat conquer his fear of water, help a minecart get unrusted, collect as many sockas as you can, and play some cheese and crackers along the way.This game also changes up its world a lot in each playthrough, objects may be in different places and different problems may need to be solved, making for great replay value.Click on everything you can for bizarre things to happen...Note:this game is relatively low in difficulty as it is designed for those of young age, so don't be so surprised if you find yourslef finishing this game very quickly."

Perhaps not as in-depth as a Telltale or LucasArts Adventure, the colorful worlds and funny characters will stll appeal to the more imaginative children you may know, and the puzzles are just difficult enough to challenge them to think outside of the box, and also may rotate to a completely different solution when played again, depending on the game.

I thought old click and points were long dead so I was pretty happy.Replaying this as an adult has reminded me of a few things I've unfortunately forgotten. One of them is clean humor. There's a lot of great humor in here that's not only for kids but adults too. It's great for everyone.Another thing is that if something seems scary, it probably isn't. I know that's sort of in kid terms but putting that into an adult perspective is useful. For example, an interview. We get all nervous and some people are downright terrified but once we're through it-- it's usually not that bad.So if you're looking for some good, clean fun this is the game for you.Or even if you just want to revisit your happy place."

I never had the chance to play this game as a kid, but I would of loved it had I actually did. The game was made by Humongous Entertainment, a company known for their educational/family oriented computer games. The plot is simple: a boy named Sam is afraid about sleeping in his own room with the lights out but instead of fearing it, he decides to overcome his fear by ""defeating"" Darkness as ""Pajama Sam"". He travels to his closet when he ""visits"" Closet Land to find Darkness. The characters are very lively and there's never a dull moment within the game. Plus Sam is voiced by the talented Pamela Adlon(Dewey from Quack Pack, Lucky from 101 Dalmations TV series, Ket from Kiki's Delivery Service, & Jue and Manabu from Animatrix). The Closet Land is a cross between The lands of Living Island, Oz, & Wonderland where anything can come to life just by clicking on it. There's also some mini games that will keep you busy for a few hours. Overrall Pajama Sam is a wonderful game for any kid to play as well as those who are young at heart."

If you're looking for a fantastic and wonderfully crafted junior adventure game then look no further. This is a game that holds up very well through the test of time. Upon picking it back up, the memories of me as a child took over and I quickly breezed through the game, I was completely blinded by the good old days, but all of that aside. I think this is a game that is perfect for children and those who are young at heart. Its a gentle little time waster, it has a bubblegum like taste to it. Its meant to be short, sweet, and to the point. The story in itself is extremely simplistic, almost a run of the mill point and click, but the game carries a ton of padding. Every little thing can be clicked on and is perfect for entertaining those of a young mind. This is one of the quintessential games for children, it helps build problem solving skills when presented with an assortment of choices and exploration. It can be beaten in a very short amount of time, but if you're new to adventure games it may take some time. The bottom line is that it is all good clean fun that can really be enjoyed by all ages.
