,Recommended,283980,9843106,"Posted: 17 April, 2014",all,cullerth,"As a millenial, I grew up on Humongous Entertainment games and was excited to see that they are re-releasing many of their old titles. Spy Fox was just charming as I remember it. I especially enjoyed picking up on a lot of the humor I missed as a child. My only complaint is that the voice actors, for reasons I cannot comprehend, are different. And they're just not getting it. If, like me, you played the original game enough to memorize all the nuances and inflections of the dialogue, the new voice acting will prove lackluster, irksome, and at times, distracting. Nonetheless, playing spy fox was a great nostalgic kick and I look forward to rediscovering more of the HE re-releases."

,Recommended,283980,11316332,"Posted: 19 July, 2014",all,AMB 10,"Let's get one thing out of the way before I continue; if you have any prior interest in Spy Fox, it's because you played these games as a kid. If you're playing these without any kind of nostalgic background, you won't have the same experience.That said, however, the first installment in the Spy Fox series seems to disprove the notion that nostalgia is a crap-covered filter. Yes, it's still a kids' game at heart, but it's doused in a comic book art style and brimming with amusing one-liners and real-world references; the majority of which flew right over my head as a kid. Humongous made kids' games that had some damn good writing, and Spy Fox: Dry Cereal is a prime example. It never wanders into subtle adult references the way Pixar does, but the cultural references got many a chuckle out of me.If anything, the game is too-filled with good writing. The titular character is suave, and his brand of humor is dry as a desert, but he has a habit of delivering one-liners any time he enters or prepares to leave an area. The writing itself never gets grating, but having the game hampered down by dialogue so often, especially when backtracking, can get annoying at times. Also potentially annoying are the puzzles. Most of them, I remembered from playing the game as a kid.The solutions are by no means Monkey-Island level of crazy, and you won't be doing pixel-hunting, but your hand is never really held as you progress You space out during a cutscene and you've got to do a bit of memory recall. Not to mention, I have no idea how a kid could figure out some of these puzzles.However, these are minor complaints. Spy Fox isn't a ""hard game"", and even if it slows down every so often to deliver oddly-choreographed dialogue, you're not going to grow increasingly impatient with it. The art style is fun, the writing is mature yet still kid-friendly, and the game's collective parody of spy culture is refreshing and appreciated. Heck, even if you didn't play this as a kid, it's still worth a shot."

,Recommended,283980,31556984,Posted: 5 May,all,PeachieCookies,"Spy Fox is an excellent series of point-and-click style adventure games for a younger audience. However, it still can draw fans from well outside of its recommended play range, especially if you played this game when you were young. The puzzles are both challenging and simple at times, and you possibly are aided by small memories of playing this game when you were little bubbling to the surface. I recommend this game wholeheartedly to anyone who played it when they were young, regardless of whether or not they beat it; anyone who has enjoyed other Humongous Entertainment games; or anyone looking for a fun romp of a game that they may have missed when it was first released. It has multiple routes and endings as well that solidify its replayability value. Please don't miss out on this suave fox of expert espionage!"

This game is built upon nothing but James Bond references and parodies, and in saying that, it still has a great feel. The game changes each time you play it, and on a lonely day, I played through it some 7 times in a row, and I was still getting unique combinations of four or five different puzzles.As games stand today, I don't know if it would hold up comparatively to AAA point and click adventure games, like the Walking Dead Game, but it is a good game.

Everything is the same as its original release, including all the voice actors. That being said, if you still have your CD copy of the game, there's nothing more to be found here beyond the convenience of Steam. The only added difference I could find during my playthrough was that Spacebar now pauses the game.All this being said, I only recommend this game to those who want the nostalgia factor, or if the purchase is for a child. You'll be able to blaze through the whole story (one variant at least) in a half hour or less. If you use the Esc key, probably 10 minutes or less on a bad day. However, the game is meant for children, and I was certainly stuck at parts for quite a while as a child."

Yeah everyone's a furry but it's not that big of a deal. It's replay ability is also very high, considering elements in the story change every time you play it. Some times you're going to have to find out how to tango with the russian enemy spy cat, some times play a highstakes game of go fish. It's childish but a great stetiotipical spy story. Also the nostalgia of playing this again after so many years was through the roof. Only complaint I had was the mouse was kinda buggy, enough so that is was fairly distracting.8/10 If you've played Spy Fox as a kid like me, you'll definitely love it."

,Not Recommended,283980,22811120,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,Double Uppercut,"This is a bit of a tough recommend, since I grew up with Spy Fox as a child. Much like Pajama Sam, I had to take off my rose-tinted nostalgia glasses to really look at this game and......Yeah, I don't like it as much as I used to.Just because I have a thumbs down on your favorite childhood game doesn't mean you should instantly dislike my review. I'm going to go into detailed reasons why I don't like Spy Fox as much now. I'm not saying I hate this game, I just don't see it as this incredibly entertaining game anymore, since I'm- you know- an adult.Spy Fox follows the James Bond parody of... Spy Fox, as he investigates a mysterious Greek island to uncover a secret villain's plot involving stealing... all the milk... then flooding the earth... so the cows get blamed... and then they'll get arrested, which means no more cow milk... then he'll get rich selling goat milk.What the hell?I understand most people will say, ""It's made for kids!"" to which I reply, ""Why are you making excuses for bad story-telling?"". I like a good deal of movies and video games out there, and  I enjoy just as many products made for children. I like Avatar: The Last Airbender, Spirited Away, and Pajama Sam #1 because they were made for kids, but also had adults in mind while they were making their stories. I never expect the most perfect story ever, but at least some sense of logic would be appreciated.On top of that, Spy Fox's voice was very... annoying to me. It didn't bother me as much when I was seven, but now, every time he breaks the game by saying a really dumb pun just immediately makes me sigh and roll my eyes. He's supposed to be charming and witty, but he comes across as the nerd in school who thinks its funny to have your jokes revolve around the same topic or remain the same type of joke.The actual gameplay is pretty meh. It's a Humongous game, so you know what's in store. Lots of clicking. But the story remains the same, with only two distinct variations between achieving your final goal, and three random keys to the M.W.D. (Milky Weapon of Destruction) that you'll have to solve one per game.That, and there's oftentimes some annoying backtracking. Especially if you want to defeat the Kawk-a-Doodle Foo guy, you have to go ALL the way back to the cafe (Yes, I mispelled C-O-C-K-a-Doodle Foo on purpose. I hate being forcibly censored). If you forget one spy gadget, you have to return to the MobCo base, and grab that gadget in order to advance.To me this game, seems significantly less developed than Pajama Sam. I mean, Pajama Sam wasn't perfect, but there was a sense of exploring an entirely new world. It was beautiful to look at and to discover the three missing items in it. In Spy Fox, the island is colored with different greys, tans, and puke greens. It's just not very appealing to look at. And you stay in the city/ocean/secret base almost the whole game. The only time you get to see more of the island is when you're driving, and even then it's not much.Pajama Sam also had structure to it, but it was flexible enough for there to be nine different variations of games. Spy Fox has about six. Again, not a big deal, but it feels severely more limited when the only difference between playthroughs is whether you go out to sea or drive, and which key you'll be grabbing this time. It doesn't feel like I'm a spy. It feels like I'm going through the motions. And that might be because I've beaten this game a ton as a kid.Besides that, there are plenty of good things in this game. There's tons of little references to James Bond and even a ton of things that have nothing to do with spies. Fox says, ""Penny, I've got your number!"" at one point, which I thought was cute. The actual animals living in this world stick out a lot and are both very well-drawn and colored. You can tell that two different people worked on the backgrounds and characters- or perhaps it was the same guy with two different ideas in mind.That, and I like the gadget and question system. Being able to hold onto 4 gadget at a time for whatever might pop up is really practical, as is gathering questions about characters and asking people about them.Plus, the game does a good job at making you feel like a spy. From playing ""Go Fish!"", to arming a missile system to blow up a door, to laser-cutting through a door- the game makes sure you feel like a secret agent on a mission.But, you know, for kids. Whatever.While its charm has worn on me, it certainly hasn't for the rabid Humongous fans out there. I still enjoyed playing through it, but I just feel like it's not as good as how I remember it. I do remember having much fonder memories of Spy Fox 3, and we'll see if that still carries. But my final score for Spy Fox in Dry Cereal is a 5/10. To me, the pros in this game pretty much equal the cons."

The resolution is a travisty, the viewport is shifted to the left, so there's a giant black bar where the content should be, it's zoomed in way to much, and the mouse support is terrible.

A great sense of nostalgia and a whole lot of fun.Pros:1.Puzzles were always interesting. Whether you were knockin aligators unconcious with the power of food or solving lazer-mirror puzzles they were always fun. As a teen now with a little bit of rememberance puzzles were easier but still fun.2.Interesting gameplay mechanics. One aspect of the game was interrogating characters about other characters for information. Timed minigames were also thrown in causing some trouble to even the older of players. Gadgets are interesting and fun.3.There are 2 endings. I've only completed one as of now. So I'll be back after completing the rest of the series again.4.Humor. There are lots of puns, jokes, and James Bond references of which I was quite fond of. Also WANNA SEE MY TATTOOCons:1: Go Fish. Really the only con. Go Fish was one of the minigames. Basically I bought a Jar of Trinkets and used them to gamble with this fat pig. We had to play Go Fish. I swear that pig had a dwarf hiding in the one sided mirror disco ball feeding him info on my card stack with a earpiece. Either that or he was psychic. Too many frustrating tries came out of this. Also guess what your reward is. Nothing. You get jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ It was supposed to be a fun minigame but it was not fun. So if you play this game. Stay away from the ♥♥♥♥ing pig. There's no point to deal with annoyance. Edit: Nevermind what I said. You have to beat him in one of the paths.Story:This time Spy Fox is up against William The Kid. He's a goat who wants to steal all the cow milk right from their udders.How does he plan to carry this heinous deed out?Well first he kidnaps Mr. Udderly, a cow that milks cows for milk... What the ♥♥♥♥ mate. That's like me farming woman's♥♥♥♥♥♥for milk so I can sell it to lil kids. Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥I think that is a real thing.Anyway he then plans to flood the world with all the milk so that he can send out tsunamis of the milk onto the world to kill everyone.Then he'll point his finger at the cows blaming them for it so they end up in jail. These cows will have to deal with Prison♥♥♥♥♥♥for the rest of their lives. Taking it in the backside in Alcatraz for an eternity.Then he'll make everyone drink goat's milk. Which honestly the last part doesn't sound half bad. I quite like Goat Cheese.Anyway like usual you and your fursona: Spy Fox have to stop him.To do so we must turn of his Milky Weapon Of Destruction (Sounds like a killer name for a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Kappa.), free the cows, and throw this goat ♥♥♥♥♥ into Alcatraz!It's fun.Play it especially if you played it as a child and are looking for a nostalgasm. If you're a furry then maybe this is the game for you."

You are transported onto the Island of Acidophilus. You have to enlist the help of a cow named Howard Hugh Heifer. And the puns go on.Within the game, you have to use specific spy gadgets or items at specific points in the story. And the story actually changes somewaht on subsequent playthroughs, which is neat. It's all so light-hearted that I can't help but feel like a kid while playing the game."

The game's good for a chuckle, isn't too difficult to figure out, but has some smart writing. Multiple play-through options for completing it; it randomizes each time you start a new game. The VA work isn't too shabby for a PC game from 1997 (noticed that Professor Quack is voiced by the guy who does Bentley from Sly Cooper). Definitely good for the kiddies, or for an idiot like me -- a 24 year old looking for a smile to unwind after work."

This franchise is a take on the James Bond films except with anthropomorphic animals as characters. You play as a suave Fox name Spy Fox who is a mix between Mr. Fox from Fantastic Mr. Fox and Maxwell Smart from Get Smart. Your mission is to prevent a mastermind named William the Kid from abducting all of the diary cows in the world and replacing the milk supply with goat's milk. With an arsenal of gadgets and a band of allies, Fox is likely to prevail in his mission. Spoofing on spy thrillers have been done countless times for games, shows, and movies. However this game is really enjoyable with the humor and each character having a unique personality prevents this game from being dull. If you love the Pajama Sam games, this one is a must have. Plus you get the option to play the game twice to see two alternate endings depending how well you do on your quest."
