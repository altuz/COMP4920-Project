,Recommended,284000,13246247,"Posted: 5 December, 2014",all,Puriti,This Put Put game is just the mini game but it's great for early childhood gamers because it has a junior arcade mode to help them out. It's pretty much playing brick breaker but with balloons and a puppy. The interface is really easy to follow and great for the younger crowd. My daughter is 3 and she figured out how to play it pretty well.

It did not run on my cutting edge 4k gaming computer at all (serious graphics glitch), so I tried another computer and it worked. Quality is below standards by years. Gameplay is repetitive. My son got seriously bored after 4 levels already and said he wants to play another game. Any other."

And im glad i can still have them to show what i grew up on. And even as a adult the game is challanging. Like that the game is not so advanced as some of these new games out. Great for kids. Thanks. and please keep it updated and working with new IOS.

,Not Recommended,284000,35313424,Posted: 29 September,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Casual - Twitch & ArcadeAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: This was part of this company's effort to diversify their offer and move away from point&click adventure edutainment titles which I think they were excellent at. Instead they whip up just pure entertainment with no educational value, but featuring the same characters. As a result this title does not play to these dev's strong suit and has aged badly.I dont know what it is, maybe it is the lack of CRT or ScummVM's port. But the controls feel really bad. As if the game was skipping frames or something. I can see the animations seem correct but the flow is seriously wrong. The game is basically just moving a trampoline left and right to keep a ball in the air and hit all targets at the top of the screen. Has the same sidebar on widescreen resolution issues other games of this dev has. Not altogether impressed, feels like flash games have a stronger offer than this, and with no educational value to salvage the title is best kept away from my permanent library into my discarded titles collection."
