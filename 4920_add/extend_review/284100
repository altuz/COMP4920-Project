,Recommended,284100,25857227,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,Pseudo,"Unclaimed World is about humans trying to survive on an alien world. Different scenarios take place at different points in the history of the world, so you see the people of the planet at different times from early in the colonization to generations later. The alien world itself has lots of strange and new species of plants and creatures, and the look of the settings is interesting and beautiful.Gameplay revolves around managing the actions of your community of colonists by giving them tasks and prioritizing. A lot of the colony management is zone-based, where you drag and create zones and indicate the actions the colonists should take within that zone - scouting out new locations, gathering resources, patrolling for dangerous creatures, etc. You also manage the production of tools, buildings, food, etc. through a production menu that has an extensive technology tree. The developers have done a great job of making it easy to click through and access information which is great because the technology of the world is well-realized, you need the right materials and tools to gather or build things, and for the more complex technologies it's relatively easy to click through the different menus to see what you might be missing.Using all this you manage the colonist's needs for food, comfort, and security. To begin with you start off with basic hunter-gatherer technologies to establish a foundation for your colony, and as you accumulate food, dwellings for your settlers, and defenses, your colonists can vote to establish new policies that simultaneously give you access to more advanced technologies but also increase your colonists' expectations of each category, which means you can't rush farming without first getting a good amount of food stocked up from fishing, berrypicking, hunting, etc. I feel like this helps to realize the technology of the world and state of the settlement - your colonists will get upset if you look to set up farms where fields will yield crops month from now, but they need foodright now.If colonists get unhappy enough, they'll leave for a neighboring settlement.Which brings up another important aspect of the game - trade. You can establish trade with neighboring settlements in order to get access to tools and resources you need, and also you can entice new people with new skillsets to your settlement. This is often necessary as your small hunter-gatherer village will probably not start off with a blacksmith, so in order to advance your technology and create new tools and buildings you'll need to find a blacksmith and ask them to join you.The game has come a long way and the developers have been great about continuing to improve on and develop the game. They're extremely responsive to questions and bug reports, and it's been a pleasure seeing this game make its journey from vision of a strange alien planet to released game. If you're interested in city building sims, survival sims, or colony management sims (e.g. Banished) you'll probably enjoy this game.As a last note, I want to point out that many of the negative reviews of this game have come from early in Early Access and the complaints are regarding problems that have since been resolved or the absence of features that have since been added to the game. If you feel this review isn't helpful, feel free to ask any questions and I'll respond in the comments and amend my review to include the information. Thanks for reading."

All the potential I hoped for never materialised.  Do not buy.  </edit>Unclaimed World has oodles of potential oozing out from between the flaws.  But don't be tempted, the flaws are terrible and many.  After playing 0.1.2.1 in January 2015. I'm going to probably give this game a year or more before trying again.  And now I have given it a year - it's January 2016 - and things have changed but not drastically.First off, the good stuff.  Unclaimed World is like Majesty and Dwarf Fortress at it's core.  You designate tasks and one or more of your free-willed plebs will undertake them.  There is no mico-managing workers.  The banter between the various colonists is the perfect way to introduce the new world.  The scenarios are not random so after a couple of tries you'll know which colonists you get and what their skills are.I like the graphical style and the smooth character animations, they give a good sense of pioneering on an alien planet.  The character portraits, whilst somewhat caricatured, make knowing and empathising with said characters much easier.But.That's where the good stops.There are currently only three stages, the tutorial which is so hand-holdy it's a chore; and not one I've forced myself to complete.  The first stage which is impossible to lose unless you try really, really had to get your colonists killed.  And lastly the second stage which crashes fairly early in.  Don't expect content, it's not here.The user interface is bad - but vastly impoved from when it was first released.  And as things start to take shape it's now possible to see higher level issues with interface.  Right click context sensitive menus have been a 'thing' for a very, very long time now.  Unfortunately the devs have ignored years of progress and have a wierd left click, bring up a small box with an arrow, left click the arrow, bring up the context sensitive menu.  Right clicking hides the interface but doesn't close anything.  Left clicking brings back all the menus as they were.Unclaimed World is SLOW.  The characters idle along at maybe 5 to 10 pixels a seond but have to traverse areas that are thousands of pixels across.  Leaving the game to run whilst doing other things seems to be the only meaningful way to play.  Even after three version bumps this is still a problem and I suspect it's a fatal one.  I've added more detail in my first comment.And the speed gets worse on the (previously mentioned) second stage.  The characters still move at about the same rate but the screen refreshes at less than a frame a second until eventually it becomes a slide show and crashes.  I'm sure a simple 2D game should run better than this.The artificial intelligence in a game where units can't be directly controlled has to be good.  But in Unclaimed World it's not.  It's awful.  I can't seem to prioritise tasks. Gathering seems to take precedence over everything.  So if there are a couple of construction projects going on and I set a new gather task then everyone drops what they're doing and rushes (relatively) to all gather the same stick of firewood.  Practicaly this means as long as there are gather tasks construcion tasks will not finish.Furthermore the AI in combat is even more deficient, with the characters commenting that they must attack as a group and then walking in one at a time; and only after the previous character has been killed.  It's horrible.  They also seem to get lost and will wander backwards and forwards through an enemy nest despite there not being any tasks near it.  I still haven't found a good way to get the colonist to move and work as a unit.In closing, Unclaimed World has a lot of potential with a good exploration and command vibe but it is so far from being completed that it's barely even a tech demo - let alone a full game.  Avoid."

I cannot recommend it.After a long development, the final game still feels like an early access version. The UI is horrible and one of the UI that really are the exact opposite of what an UI should do. It is not responsive, easy to control, easy to be informed and it is not interactive. You need excessively many clicks to do the most basic things.The graphic is nice – until u realize you cannot zoom in. It is like having an ant farm – just boring.Content wise this game doesn’t offer much and after a few hours, you are just done."

I really like the concept of trying to survive in an unknown region then having the ability to control the outcome of each and every one of your people. Currently I own several early access games and Unclaimed World is deffinately at the top of my list. Patience is key with all early access games expect buggs. And talk about them. Creating games is a long process especially if the dev team is small. Overall the game has a great concept with unlimited possibilities and I like sim type games so I recommend this game. If any potential buyers of unclaimed world want more info please feel free to message me I will get back to you as soon as possible.

But the design of the game is pretty unique, and also consider that you come from space, but you you'll need to discover again a lot of technologies during a normal game.A funny game, not perfect, but I think is worth of his price.The problems: there are a couple of bugs, but, so far, I haven't find any annoying problem.No, the main problem is, sadly, the UI design...It works, but I sincerely don't understand why creating a design so difficult to understand and to use.It's possible to create and repeate and programming tasks, but you fail to grasp all the possibilites and probably you'll find yourself to be annoyed.Overall: a good game, not overpriced, and pretty unique for his design, but also not for who don't like to do micromanagement tasks and slide some graphs."

Loads of materials, intermediate products and lots of different types of production. It's more The Settlers than RimWorld, though your people do have information about them tracked, from energy to tiredness, hunger, and general happiness too, amongst other things.I'll update this to have more detail once I've played some more of it, but so far, it's good."
,Not Recommended,284100,28588257,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,nocrane,I really wanted to like this game. Around 6 months ago I tried it but it was far from complete and I thought they are trying hard lets give them some time and try again. After all that time I installed it again. They fixed some of the bugs but most of them are still there. People are always starving. You just spend most of your time trying to get people to eat so they wont die or leave. When you try to build new stuff it is even more annoying. Sometimes they will build it like an hour later and sometimes they wont even bother. Every 10 minutes you have to save it or it will slow down like hell eventhough I have the latest Alienware 17 so it is definitely a programming issue or even worse it will crash. In 3 hours game time it crashed more than 5 times.It is a great idea with bad elements. There is still some fun to be had and spend time. I wouldn't say it is unfixable but it needs proffessional focusing. I dont believe most gamers would be as patient as me. 5/10

I am writing this review as of version 0.9, have been playing since early Alpha, and have logged 80hrs on this game. I will say that a lot of those hours were very frustrating and felt like a slog BUT - the game is really improving.What's not so great:Thankfully it's mostly stuff that's still in progress!* Finicky system for harvesting resources; sometimes they're visible but not harvesting* Balance still needed for food production and how the colonists perceive their level of supply and comfort* Lots of time waiting for colonists to finish tasks* No randomized maps* Sometimes difficulty is frustrating rather than challenging* Still has some instability/crashesWhat's great:* Maps are handcrafted and beautiful, and highly dynamic and interactive* Feels like a fleshed out eco-system into which your colonists are intruding (not just hey there are rabbits and also wolves)* Highly varied animal species which each play unique role* TONNES of things to harvest, which can be over-harvested and lead to realistic resource scarcity, forcing your colonists to wait for them to regrow! You have to plan your settlement strategically* Cobbling together buildings and tools from realistic ingredients (not oh hey I need 5 wood and now magically have a workbench - you can see the ingredients in the design of each structure: i.e., this simple workbench has a big purple leaf as its awning, and this could break and need to be replaced)* Highly stratified task-management system to juggle priority of specific tasks and task categories* Each colonist has not just specific skill sets but different priorities for the colony (some want better food, others can live off survival rations but want more comfortable living arrangements)* Different scenarios in different timelines give different blends of survival/advanced technology perfect for a Space Western kind of genre.* Slowly and deliberately build from a collection of tents and eating fish to a developed industry town producing machine parts, finished rubber products, bombs, or moonshine!Overall the game really is ajoyto play, and I wait with baited breath for each content release. It feels very distinct from other similar games, such as Stonehearth, Rim World, and Clockwork Empires and has a lot to recommend it!"

While the graphics do look nice I din't think they were especially clear in terms of being able to tell you what's going on. Lastly I didn't get the feeling of emergent gameplay which is what I usually like about similar sandbox style games. Even though you don't directly control your colonists, there is little sense that anything much will happen if you don't intervene.I sort of feel bad for not recommending this because I suppose a lot of this is a matter of taste and it could be said that the developers weren't trying to make ""that kind of game"" but I think this will pop up as recommended for a lot of people like me who like games like Rimworld, Prison Architect, Planetbase or just straight citybuilders."

I keep losing all my coloniists, for 1 reason or another but it's not the 'rage quit' kind of feeling. I'm learning more and more about what NOT to do and what I should focus on.Still needs some work in some areas but the devs have been so active in the forums that I'm pretty sure they have a medical IV drip of coffee to their veins.Well, I gotta get back there and get some more water cane stems so I can build the workshop and I'm sure the damned binal rats have probably eaten all my food stores while I've been away."

The graphics didn’t seem to be worth a mention … I mean you’re playing with midgets Well two days ago I though what the heck, seeing as the devs are not going to drop the price I just get it over with and buy it. They’ll probably reduce the price now that I’ve bought the game (Murphy’s Law).I have only 90 minutes on record with this game and I must admit, its 90 minutes that went by very quickly. The reason being that I started enjoying these midgets’ tasks to complete. They seem a bit lazy because they move very slow, but hey their going through a tough time right. And they seem reluctant to start working on tasks that are urgent, but that’s the rebellious nature of man. As mentioned the time spent on playing this game went buy very quickly and that is because I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. Its one of those games where you say “I just want them to build this before I quit”, and after that its one more thing and the process just keep on repeating itself until you see the night is gone and you need to get ready for school or work, or even worse you’re totally late for your date with the girl of your dreams. O well, you’re now learning how to survive, so you’ll probably get a new girl. Maybe not your dream girl but hey, if you play sports you have to live with the injuries.I can appreciate the fact that the game is still in early access therefor a lot of work still needs to be done. So I think the end product should be very good. The idea of starting with nothing, salvaging, gathering and surviving is a very intriguing idea and I think there is a level of satisfaction to make these guys do stuff in order to survive.So do I recommend buying Unclaimed World in its early access state?

The developers have put effort into polishing it, and there have definitely been some optimizations, however I'm still not very impressed and I won't be playing this very much if at all.The isometric view of the game is frustrating. I keep wanting to zoom in on what is happening, but you only ever have the one fixed distance and it is from a long way out. You end up peering at the map to try and find details like plants etc that should be easy to identify.The control interface is not intuitive. Everything feels clumsy and wrongly done. Too many complicated menus, with information and controls in unlikely places. The game itself is not that complex, but learning the interface is.  I can't help but feel that a more experienced team might have designed this differently and more effectively.The pace is not well balanced, and the game drags. The first tutorial takes about 15 minutes to play through, even if you speed up time x4, however what happens feels like it should take 5 minutes. I always feel like I'm waiting for the game to catch up. That's the real killer for me, I find the game is tedious to play, and plain not entertaining.I wish I could support this small indy team more, but to be honest I'd never recommend this game to a friend.5/10 - not actually broken, but not worth playing.ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM EARLY ACCESSHard to review this game. It's in an early stage of development, sure, but even allowing for the small development team it feels like its been stuck in the same rut for a long time.  There have been several updates, but nothing has changed much and the fundamental flaws remain.  The interface is problematic, and the control system feels disconnected.I've persevered and have spent about 4 hours playing the test scenarios, but inevitably I only stay there for 15 minutes at a time before getting bored and frustrated.  I'd like to hope that it will evolve into something interesting - the potential is certainly there - but so far it's just not grabbing me.Thumbs down, I'm afraid - I'd like to give the developers more encouragement, but if the question is ""would I recommend this to a friend at this time"" then the answer is simply ""no""."

I am going to leave my original review on but I will move it to the end.I have decided to unrecommend this game because the developers have stopped adding comment and promised more than what they were willing to put into this game. It really looked like it was going places for a while there with regular updates and gameplay changes but I suppose why continue with the dev when you've already milked the cow. I won't be supporting Nordic Games in future.***Below is the original reviewThis game is an absolutely amazing concept for an economic/town management type simulator. I love how the game combines advanced technologies with very low level primitive technologies to give an exciting twist on economic and town management in a futuristic sci-fi setting.If you enjoyed playing the old Caesar 3, Emperor and Pharoah games then then this is your type of simulation game but it is however much more than these games because it combines other aspects into the settlement running that make it a lot less mechanical and requires a lot more input from the player, it really pulls the aspects of building a town that will thrive while ensuring that you survive together into one continuous journey. You will constantly be tested by dangerous beasts that try to eat your settlers and plagued by vermin who steal your food stores.I bought this game at a very early stage of development and was very disappointed with the lack of features in the game but since the release of a lot more content it has started to become the simulator/town management game that I have dreamed of playing for so long and has really in my opinion become money well spent on a game under development even though I didn't initially feel this way.Be advised that the game is still in a very early stage of development and there does tend to be a long wait time on updates to the game but when an update is released it tends to add a whole new level of depth to the game which really makes it worth playing which is why I have recently logged so many hours playing this game.I would like to see a lot more content added to this game both in the world variety (fauna, flora and environment) as well as different scenario types each with their own unique challenges. Unfortunately there is only a single player mode so there is no intertribal warring and there is currently no sandbox mode."

It's quite successfull with that, and you usually have some alternatives and options to chose from.
