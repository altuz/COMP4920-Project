Technically speaking, the graphics look like something that would be home on a tablet rather than your desktop PC.If you can look past these issues, the game has a lot to offer. The focus on stealth is refreshing. The writing is solid, giving you just enough information to keep you interested, while also keeping you (mostly) in the dark. The references to real world conspiracies and plots are well done, presuming you are at least familiar with the subject material.The atmosphere is arguably the strong point of Majestic Nights. Stylistically, the visuals are bright and bold and oozing with 80s flair. The soundtrack is phenomenal.The season pass offers pretty good value. The soundtrack is probably worth the $20 alone. There is also a Pen and Paper RPG on the way, which is not something you see offered everyday.It's not a game for everyone, but it certainly has its merits."

There are a few hiccups with the controls and gameplay, but overall I still thought it was a great experiences.

While I like the dialogue (what little there is,) the art style, and the music, the majority of this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stealth mechanics, frustrating combat, and bugginess. The AI is alternately dumb as a bag of rocks or clairvoyant - capable of shooting you through walls or thwarted easily by waiting for them to lose interest in the gun wielding, big haired assassin they just saw running past them. Your character can generally only take a few hits before dying in a ten second long slo-mo death animation (which you'll be seeing a lot if you play on hard mode - here's a hint; don't) and your enemies either go down with a single hit or as much as three bullets / katana swipes. When you die, you get to do the whole sequence over again!I was having fun with this game until the second chapter - Cardholder's story is generally a bit less actiony-shooty, although after a certain point the investigative adventure game aspect of the game is seemingly tossed out the window in favor of horrendous stealth and fighting with Cal's second chapter.It's also buggy. The AI can often see you through walls and shoot you through them. You will get objectives you've already completed. You will see conversations that have already happened happen again. You will not be able to talk to certain characters despite their being highlighted. Enemies will somehow vanish between loading screens.What's good? I -sorta- like the story, though I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what's going on with it. You're basically thrust into the plot with absolutely zero lead up or introduction, no idea who you're playing as, what their motivations are, what's at stake, who the bad guys are... is this one of those rare games that would benefit from a narrative text dump? Yes, probably. Or, y'know, a cutscene, something to establish what's even happening.I also like the art. The dialogue is witty and very 80s, which is exactly what you should expect. Music's also fine - I have a softness for techno and electronica. To be honest, I'm disappointed so far in what I've seen. I was really looking forward to playing a game with this sort of concept, but the shortfalls in gameplay and story make it nigh intolerable right now.However, since Majestic Nights is coming out in installments, I imagine there's plenty of time for the developers to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and iron out the terrible aspects of this game. Hopefully.Right now, it's a waste of 20 bucks - stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from a season pass until they improve on this."

For my money this means Majestic Nights is darned good fun: full of good humour, fun action, great atmosphere and some fascinating over-arching conspiracy stuff to tie it all together. Makes me glad I picked up a Season Pass just in time for Episode 2. It's not without its flaws -- in particular that this engine, like SRR's, isn't super well suited to stealth mechanics -- but the fun outweighed the flaws for me by a comfortable margin. Worth getting."

Stealth system is quite fine, until you draw your gun and shoot your way out like Clint Eastwood or like James ""Sonny"" Crockett from Miami-Vice. I must say, I am a 80's lover, so I really enjoyed the game.Bad things about this game? Dialog speed during cutscenes and in-game. They are going too fast to read and are disturbing. And also, game has different mission / scenarios , that you need to buy as dlc or with a season-pass , sadly I felt like I was kinda ripped-off a little bit.If you are an indie-game lover or 80's lover like me. Buy this game, dont wait and push it to the limit!"

The music fits, the scenes look just like they should for the story line and premise. Some of the dialogue feels a little cheesy but then again, the 80's was cheesy.My only real complaint is with the aiming system on the gun. It almost seems as if it fights you. I think they couldve done better with a free floating, mouse controller crosshair. And for some reason in the bar/club scene (Whisky) a lot of the patrons that are sittings are cut in half (torso on the floor) until I enter the area. then they correct themselves.Overall its good way to kill some time and $5. I thought it was going to be a little more action intense but thats ok. Just know that its more of an adventure/easy puzzler/story-driven game. Its also a little easier to play with a controller.

So for $5 you are getting good bang for your buck. FFS it's an indie title that is the price of a cup of coffee. It has a good 80's retro art style simmilar to Borderlands. An off the beaten track gameplay, which can only be a good thing, unless you like playing the same game over and over. Cool story and it is episodic. So you get more story later on.

Also I did notice with playing the prologue there we're a lot of bugs nothing game breaking but just things such as NPC's clipping into objects such as seats and tables when ever I moved around they would change positions at times. Also only 2 chapters? I completed chapter zero very quickly it seemed really short I even went through it again to see what other dialogue I could find.

I loved the concept and the art style to pieces. However, what it really turned out being was a buggy, underdeveloped, and repetitive mess. I don't even think that a good dab of polish could fix this. You're either talking to people (which is more simplistic than I've seen it in just about any other RPG), or you're doing cover based shooting. Hell, the only thing that seperates this from a generic cover based shooter like ""Gears of War"" is the vaguely isometric perspective. It's a dull and watery game wearing an older and more complex game's hat.I can only hope that the developers take this criticism to heart and improve upon their product, because I think with the right tweaks and craftsmanship this game could become really great, instead of the amateurish product it is now. The game is far from irredeemable. If the team really pulled through and made some stellar later chapters, and perhaps thoroughly patched out these ones, then I might feel like it's worth recommending. As of now however, I can not, in good faith, recommend this game."

The dialog is fairly amusing, and the locations are delightfully seedy hotbeds of crime and conspiracy. The stealth leaves a little to be desired because it's not easy to stay in cover, and you can't pan the camera so it's hard to tell when the coast is clear, but it's good enough that you don't need to spend the whole game shooting people. It's neat how many places you can get through by talking your way in too. Not a high budget AAA extravaganza by any means, but one of the better indie action adventures i've played.

Now unfortunately the game has a way less intense and way more bland soundtrack, making the experience worse then it could have been. But as it is the case with many games it should be judged on its own, not compared to other games.It has its own feel of the '80s', however the cars used seem to be from 50s-60s, the streets are as good as modern detroit, and its supposed to be somewhere near los angeles by the looks of it. Its minor details which dont make too much difference anyway.Now the gameplay isnt perfect, the shooting system is pretty bad, there are game glitches  like shooting through walls, ai having very limited behaviour and moonsliding, ignoring the corpses, bugs and gameplay errors. But none of them are fatal, every single bug can be ignored.For an indie game, this is fantastic work. And for the price they are asking its decent. Now the issue im having is the game is heavily centered around dlc, with it pretty much having x3.5 pricetag of the engine of the game + chapter 0 and 1.I would recommend trying the demo 1st to see if you like the game, or if you are willing to play and support indie developer, get the game.Could use more polish, especially in the sound department and ai behaviour.Overall solid 5/10. *and 7-8 for indie - there are better games, but this one is not bad by all means.*Gameplay: 7/10Graphics 3/10Plot 7.5/10Sound 1/10"

When that is done you get transported to the combat part.The game does a bad job of establish its rules clearly, like why are enemies shooting at me in this room but talking to me in here, why does cover work this time but not last time.The Combat is really bad with wonky controls both on gamepad and mouse/keyboard, bad AI, weird wonky cover system that functions 33% of the time.It's like if the developer wanted to make a adventure game and then realised one third in that writing is hard so they instead padded out the rest of the game with unfinished combat system.Story is shallow and badly written relying on name dropping big conspiracy theories without giving them any context/background or even information on what they are.I would love to have something positive to say about this or even be more passionate in the problems of this game. But it feels so unfinished in every aspect that there isn't much to point at.50 lines of dialog isn't a story, the stealth and combat is so wonky that you can't be ""good"" or ""bad"" at it as it's so random if it works or not.It's not expensive so check it out if you feel like it, but it's not ""funny bad"" just wonky, buggy and boring."

You are a renegade secret agent (or a detective, depending on the season) that gets knee-deep in the world of conspiracy facts (rather than theory). In short, let's just say that if you grew up in the 80s and experienced the best the Internet had to offer in the early to mid 90s, you'll feel right at home. If you didn't, there are in-game dossiers that will bring you up to speed without being too lengthy.Speaking about the writing, not only is it great but there are different conversational ways (non-evident most of the time) of accomplishing objectives, which warrants replayability, kind of a big deal for a game that's not too long at the moment.The music is spot-on for the atmosphere of the game (in the style of 80s synthwave revival) and is included with the game at no extra cost, in MP3 and FLAC - bonus points for a game when so many others sell the OST separately."

Engine and gameplay can be a little finnicky, and while the writing is pretty good, it has that cheese to it you'd expect from an 80s film, which may be a tad distasteful to some, not taking itself too seriously.Does it justify a buy so far in it's current state, with Barbary Heat finally released (which I am yet to play)?If you absolutely love the story and tone it puts forward, then even then, think about it. The gameplay is shodding and writing could live a tad little to be desired.If not, hold off a little bit.

After you make your way through the character dialogue and gather your things, you then proceed to a stealth level where you must get your silenced pistol and access codes from your house. Stealth isn't too bad, you hide in the dark and AI have pre-determined patrol paths, pretty easy for me. Not sure why everyone else had so much trouble, though I haven't played much! These are just my first impressions.Upon starting this mission, I realize that this game more linear than I thought! I was disappointed to find this out, as from the screenshots and trailer, the game had large maps, and it really looked like an open world RPG in the style of the old fallout games! While playing this mission, I went to the wrong house, to find an overweight man who is supposed to be John's neighbor, being interrogated by a female police officer while he is trying to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥What the hell. After waiting for the officer to leave the house, I then talk to 'my' neighbor (I'm playing as John), and then say that I'm here to collect my spare house keys. Perhaps if you go through the dialogue correctly, you could obtain an item that allows you to use the back door and further avoid police officers roaming your house? I couldn't exactly find out.If you walk next to two bushes (Which are very deliciously stylized btw, like Deathspank meets Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us) a mediocre scripted sequence occurs, where two officers guarding the front entrance to your house start gossiping and then leave. I hated this! I would have rather had a more dynamic event, where you can move about as they gossip and leave, instead of just waiting for a cutscene to play out. Very frustrating design choice!I then make it into my house, and then proceed to get my pistol and access codes, or atleast try to..I had to restart this mission as I was spotted and then shot to death in my house. When you restart a level, you restart from the beginning. This is terrible! Though these missions are fairly short, but still very frustrating design.I made it back to the inside of my house, i get my pistol and my access codes, and then I pop the 3 officers roaming my house who were looking for me and were trying to kill me, then I complete the level! This level was alright, could be much better.To improve:More emergent design: How about allowing me to distract the cops by triggering a car alarm on one of the cars parked outside my house, allowing the player time to get in and get out, and perhaps if cops are coming back into the house, the player could leave through the back door or a window you can go through, perhaps with a vaulting mechanic?Stealth Kills: Choke holds and neck snapping.Extra Infiltration options: Allow me to get into my house through something like a window or a back door, or from a side door inside a garage or something, some homes have garages attached to the homes themselves with doors inside them that allow you to get into your home after exiting your car and closing the garage doors, that would have been interesting.-Next mission you have to make it inside of a nightclub, I kick a bouncer in the scrotum, make my way inside to ask people annoying questions, and try to avoid getting knocked out by the same bouncer I kicked in the family jewels.I make it to the basement floor to meet ""Mystery"" who then claims to know who I am, I then go through the dialogue and Mystery wants me to buy them a shirly temple from the bar, I get suckerpunched multiple times by the angered bouncer, whom I bashed in the balls with my boot. This was extremely aggrivating, I'm quite a distance away from this guy and his haymakers have ridiculous range! I also could not equip my silenced pistol and deal with this bouncer after luring the AI character to the bathroom or something to avoid making a scene, certainly no cool emergent design choices like that!To improve:More emergent design: Allow the player to lure AI (which are seeking the player and trying to kill them) into a discrete area (Like the bathroom of the nightclub) and deal with them there, either with a stealth kill or by allowing them to equip items like the silenced pistol (It is in the inventory and I can see this VERY clearly) if the player is willing to get their hands a little dirty when dealing with bad guys.Extra Infiltration options: Is there a back door to the nightclub? Maybe a window leading to the basement area or the bathroom? Maybe an airvent of some kind? That would be cool, allow me to avoid kicking a bouncer in the ballsack.-I had to stop playing at this point, as all this flawed design really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, but I wouldn't say that this game is terrible, just not my cup of tea. I was hoping for more of an Open World Realtime Action RPG, but alas, it was not. I don't really know how to feel about it, I wish I could select ""Maybe"" instead of Yes/No, because it's not like this game is completely bad! The stealth segment was kinda fun (Same with the shooting) and I was able to choose what my favorite conspiracy theory was at the beginning of the game. (IE: Area 51, and the Kennedy Assassination are selectable dialogue choices in the introduction level, I got a kick out of this.)I would have loved a more open freeroaming action RPG game with multiple methods of approach to each objective, but unfortunately this game does not, or atleast not yet.

Buttons on the controller just stop working, until I pressed all of them, moved the mouse, tried using the keyoard--then controller started working again.  Until it didn't, and when faced with the first combat scenario I try to press the right trigger to fire as it instructs me, but instead the character just stands there and three or four new prompts to press the right trigger show up over the original one.  I don't expect AAA production values from smaller developers but I expect the game to be playable for at least 45 minutes.  This game is a lemon."
