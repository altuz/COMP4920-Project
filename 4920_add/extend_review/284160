I also should mention there is a great fan base with amazing forums, also can't forget the spectacular community mods that are out there. Cheers.Edit: I'm here to update my review as I now have clocked 700 hours! Yes that is correct, I managed to find something to do on this game for 700 hours exact.

,Recommended,284160,33825183,Posted: 26 July,all,∴ S H Λ D E ∴,"This game to some people will be boring at first, as the sole objective is similar to garrys mod: Clown around using a game engine, doing anything you can really think of. This game will make you want to drive like a dumbass in real life just to see if when you crash it will look just like in Beamng.Most car simulator/racing games today focus on the graphics and making the game LOOK good, while the gameplay is lacking in detail and realism, creating beautiful games, but not realistic games that actually PLAY good. Not this game. The cars and crash modeling in this game are so similar to real life its insane; just search up a beamng crash vs a real life crash test and the cars, the results are shockingly similar. This game has realistic physics that feel as if the car is an actual automobile with weight and power, you can feel the difference in the cars which is something most ""racing sim"" games lack. The damage on each car goes deep down to every single node and beam in the car models, ensuring no two crashes are alike in this game.In most racing/sim games made nowadays, the cars can crash full speed into a wall and go off as if nothing happened, with a few bumps and scratches, smoke coming out of the hood, and MAYBE, just maybe if youre lucky, a missing bumper. Missing bumper after going 200+ mph into a wall? Should be a missing EVERYTHING after a crash at that speed. And those same games are the ones that claim to be the most ""realistic"" games out there, which is just a sad excuse for realism.This is one of the few games that was made putting the GAMEPLAY and physics first, graphics second (and theyre still pretty damn good). It is a damn shame that this game isnt more popular than it is now. The base game alone is pretty interesting and gives you a good introduction to what it is all about, and you can easily get plenty of gameplay out of it, however the huge variety of mods make this game worth buying even more. Do you want to drive a raging monster truck inside a demolition derby arena and spawn four honda civics that try to chase you around the arena, crushing them under your wheels in ultra realistic damage modeling until their engines seize up? Do you want to drive down the highway in an old school muscle car, pedal to the medal, only to fall of the edge of a cliff and go tumbling down, breaking every part along the way? This game is the one for you. Hell, this game could even be used in a real life driving school simulator, with a wheel and pedals connected to it. Its that realistic.The only problem i see with this game is that you need a fairly powerful computer to run it well as this is a very demanding game due to the next generation physics and detailed crashes. Soft body physics stress the cpu as it doesnt render the car as a ""hardbody"" car like most games do, it instead renders every single part as a seperate piece and kind of ""glues"" them all together.There are infinite possibilities in this physics engine, and a huge mod database for this game as well if you get bored of the base game vehicles.  If you are like me and are sick and tired of all these crappy games coming out nowadays that claim to be realistic but offer no damage modeling and arcade like physics, do yourself a favor and purchase this game. It is what you are looking for. I can only sit back and wish that racing games nowadays could follow suit and start putting gameplay before the graphics like this game does."

,Recommended,284160,17394144,"Posted: 4 August, 2015",all,PsychoMantis,"TL;DR: Get it. DO IT.This is the game I've dreamed about as a destructive child, a simple child, melting my match box cars with gasoline. I grew up playing with Crash Test Dummies. I've played every system since Atari. I have waited decades for a game like this. Bunout series, Destruction Derby series, Vigilante 8 series, Route 66, and ""Next Car Game,""- Nothing compares to this. Yes, I know those games are different genres, but nontheless... You know what? Maybe I am overzealous. Or maybe, just maybe, this is what I've been waiting on for my whole gaming life. All I can say is, if this game wasn't touched again by developers, if this was the final product: I'd pay $100 for it. I may trade my Xbox One for it (Rare Replay included).  I was uneasy purchasing the early access but BeamNG.drive called out to me, I could not wait, and the positive reviews after the update were the final straw. I am 31 years old. Thirty one people. I may be too old to get one off when VR porn comes into full futrition, but at least I can say, I have experienced my gaming destiny: BeamNG.drive. Developers: I love you."
76561198072547004,Recommended,284160,20842042,"Posted: 29 January, 2016",all,Haydz,"Perfect game for any car fan, regardless of age.There's not a whole lot of fancy graphics, no lens flares, relatively simple smoke/dust effects, most foliage (except trees) are made of flat textures (which are pretty well done, you can't really tell unless you stop and zoom right in on the grass, looks fine if you're driving even at low speeds), and the shaders aren't modified to give a 'cinematic look'. So this game isn't an astonishingly pretty game. But you know what, that's okay.Each vehicle is intricately modelled, down to the point where you can see each individual part of the engine. You can see the butterfly valves on your supercharged V8 muscle car, you can see the engine block move around in its mounts slightly as you rev the engine. The level of detail is insane. Hit a harsh bump that bottoms out your custom, lowered car? Be prepared to potentially have your entire exhaust system ripped out of your car. Hit a sharp kerb at high speed? Might wanna watch your tires, they can pop, giving your car an unnatural feel. The physical damage in this game is brutally realistic, as each car is not 'hard-coded' with performance stats, health points, etc. Each INDIVIDUAL PART of a car makes up it's whole performance, much like a real car. Pop your front-right tire, and your car will start veering slightly to the right. Fit sport tires, you might be able to handle a corner slightly faster. Lower your suspension, you'll reduce body rolls and keep all 4 tires on the road better, resulting in better grip.It goes on and on. The soft-body physics overall are brilliant, the cars crumple, wobble, and react exactly how you'd expect a car to react.Maps:The maps that come with the game are very nice, and quite varied.Gridmap: A testing map, with an assortment of jumps, surface types (from sand and dirt to mud and water), slalom cones, objects to crash into and a few high-speed race courses.Port: A small map set on a port, a perfect map for Gymkhana or drifting fans, with all kinds of shipping containers, warehouses, and a few ramps along with it.Industrial Site: A medium sized map set on a seaside industrial area, it features a RallyCross track with multiple configurations, an offroad racing track laced with thick mud that will bog down your average rally car, but take a big 4x4 and you'll plow straight on through, and a more traditional tarmac race course. The industrial area also features many warehouses like the Port map, and a nice little circuit that races around it, featuring a jump over a small inlet.East Coast USA: Set in the East Coast of the USA (As the nae suggests), it has a medium-sized town, along with fairly well maintained roads, that go from the coast to snaking through the forest. Lots of dirt trails through fields and woodlands for rallying around too.Jungle Rock Island: On a Tropical Island, this map has poorly-maintained roads that call for terrifying high-speed driving along the coastline of this island. It also has many offroad dirt trails that run through the forest, and can quite easily end up getting you lost! There's also a few little rally trails, and industrial areas, quarries, and a port. Probably my favourite map.Cliff: Spawns you in at the top of a cliff, the only way around is down the cliff. Fun little map for just throwing stuff of cliffs and watching it arrive at the bottom as a mangled mess. Not much to the map other than that, but still fun nonetheless.Hirochi Raceway: A race-focused map, this raceway is GP-styled, with very wide, smooth corners, along with fast straights and chicanes thrown in. This map also has a few forest routes, that can take you on a narrow road through some forests, so any mistakes can be fatal.So, quite a few maps, with lots of variety.ScenariosThe game has a wide variety of scenarios, too many to list here, that cover multiple fun aspects of the game.These can range from tutorials, to shakedowns of various cars, police chases, races, delivery challenges, even a 'hyper-miling' challenge where you have to cross Jungle Rock Island with very little gas left in your car. There's even a demolition derby scenario for people to 'party play'.Overall, I'd give this game a 8/10, I'd like to see networked multiplayer (something the BeamNG devs might implement if their engine can support it) and a campaign mode (which the devs have planned pretty much since day 1 of the project)Lots more potential, the modding community is great, who make new maps, scenarios, vehicles, etc, etc.Definitely worth the buy, especially for car fans, IMO."

76561198032744129,Recommended,284160,24652911,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,HolyDuckingShip,"Quick Summary:  BeamNG.drive was a surprise find for me.  It's an ambitious game that replicates realism and simulation on levels that other well known sim racers can't currently compete with.  It isn't without faults, of course, and there are areas where the immersion is broken.  However, I think a lot of this will eventually be addressed before the game actually releases.  There's a lot of fun to be had here, driving/racing enthusiasts should definitely give it a try.In-Depth:  The game is best described, in my opinion, as a sandbox driving game.  I hesitate to directly compare this to sim racing titles as BeamNG.drive feels more ambitious than that--it has racing, sure, but its scope is much larger.  Before I start going into the game further, my experience is based on playing the game using the following set up:Thrustmaster TX Servo w/ 458 wheelThrustmaster T3PA Pro Pedals w/ conical brake modThrustmaster TH8A ShifterRSeat ChassisPredator X34 monitorThe game detected my equipment fine, but did not automatically set everything up correctly by default.  With that said, I absolutely love how you can assign absolutely everything in the game to any button on your wheel or if you have a button box.  It also allows multiple mappings, so you can have keyboard commands simultaneously.  The overall UI is clean and easy to understand--it has a couple quirks, but overall very nice for such an early game.I have a pretty strong PC, and the game runs relatively well.  I'd expect for it to be even better optimized as it moves closer to actual launch, but its current state runs quite well.  I did have to run it in fullscreen or the game would barely run.  So if you are used to setting yours up as bordless windowed or anything like that, you may have to fiddle with some things to get it working properly.The game looks incredible.  Most racing sims really focus on the cars visuals, which makes sense, but track side visuals usually pale in comparison.  BeamNG.drive is much more even--the cars, interiors, and environments are all equally beautiful, which I'm a big fan of.  There are plenty of graphical settings, however, I mostly had everything turned all the way up to max playing at 3440x1440 and it was great.  I'm kind of blown away with how nice and even the game looks for being still early in development.On to the actual gameplay.  The game here is a bit split for me--at times (most of them), it felt like the most realistic driving experience I've ever had, but there were some times where the feeling was a bit off.  The few off times did seem to occur on paved surfaces, but it could also be the fault of my forcefeedback not accurately relaying to me what was happening with the car.  This is an area I think could use some improvement, the forcefeedback is present, but feels underdeveloped compared to the rest of the experience. (Assetto Corsa is my benchmark for forcefeedback)Now a bit more on why I would not directly compare this to sim racing games.  This game is so much more ambitious than that.  I would call this a driving simulator, not a racing sim.  There's a lot of variety here, and while it does have some racing, I was more impressed with its environments off-road.  I hope this doesn't sound like a knock on the game--I think it could be a great sim racing game if they focused on that, but this game is so much more.To the above point, there is a scenario mode which highlights all of the variety.  These scenarios are incredibly different from one another and provide a taste of what sort of possibilities there are for this game.  I won't go into them all, as there are quite a lot, but here's a couple:Car Delivery - Here you are driving a flatbed and have a sports car on the back.  You're tasked with delivering the sports car to its new owner.  You are timed and are required to deliver it without damaging it too much.Police Chase - Someone has robbed a bank and is making a getaway, you're tasked with stopping them.Van Jumps - There are some crazy jumps in this game, but the set you'll need to tackle with a van are some of the most difficult.This game has plenty more to offer including rally style driving, offroading, etc. There is also a mode that just lets you load up in a map and create your own fun.  You can spawn in multiple cars and objects, which allows you to set up some incredibly fun stuff.Now onto the game's main feature, it's soft body physics/damage.  This is by far in a way the most impressive thing I've seen in a video game in the past few years.  It's without equal to my knowledge, and adds a layer of not only realism, but also fun to this game.  It seems everything can be damaged, starting with the obvious body panels, all the way to individual axles, driveshafts, and engine internals.In closing, this game is very ambitious, beautiful, realistic, and fun.  There's a large variety of environements and driving surfaces.  This is a sandbox driving game at the moment and is amazing at what it does.  If you enjoy the chaos, destruction, and stunts of something like Burnout, or the make your own fun of any sandbox titles, you should definitely give this game a try."

My favorite is taking a small European car and jumping over several buses, off a cliff. If you are no fun and don't like car crashes this is also a robust car simulator. Modifying the gear ratios, tire pressure, suspension response, and more allows you to make a unique car for any occasion. There are also several ""levels"" but you will be making most of the fun on your own. There are regular updates but as for content you might want to check out the mods on the website. This introduces many new ""cars"" and maps that can be really interesting. Keep in mind that the local multiplayer is very limited (no split screen) and pretty much only demolition derby. Also, you can make the game work with a controller if you want to make it a more standard driving game but you will loose much of the functionality so keep mouse and keyboard nearby.

BeamNG.drive feels like it belongs in the ""Software"" section compared to the ""Games"" section of my Steam Library. Not a traditional game by any means, BeamNG.drive does its best to be the most detailed ""soft body"" simulator on the market. I've had hours of fun already just repeatedly crashing cars into the wall and watching them disintegrate in beautiful slow motion, makes the car destruction aspect of ANY OTHER GAME look like crap in comparison. So beautiful to watch metal deform and bend realistically and the guts of the vehicle's engine get ripped out from brutal impacts. If you like watching super slow motion crash safety tests and cars you will love this game.It's a pure sandbox more than a game, if you want races/ objectives you won't find much of it here, but what you will find is an expansive modding community that's added tons of levels and vehicles to the game, increasing its value significantly. There are also scenarios that you can race or just have fun trying to ram vehicles off the road. As long as you pick this game up KNOWING that it's a simulation and NOT a traditional game, you will find yourself enjoying it quite a bit. It's so addicting to just smash cars together, and eventually with the implementation of a ""campaign"" plus more standard racing modes I can see this game being an amazing product down the line."

Despite being early access, the completed portions of the game are very well done. Bugs and other errors are fixed almost as quickly as they occur, in part due to the wonderful community on the BeamNG forums.One of the best parts of BeamNG.drive is the community surrounding it. Over on the BeamNG.drive forums there are hundreds of mods, and plenty of support for problems you may have. Like any growing community, there are inevitably going to be new users and immature reactions from people, but once you figure out who to ignore the forums is a very welcoming place with an amazing selection of mods.On the topic of modding, the game is extremely open to mods. Very few mods conflict with each other, and there isn't a limit to the number of mods you can be using at a time. However, if you are interested in making a mod for BeamNG.drive, it is a time-consuming task that takes a while to understand.-Making new maps can be done with the included in-game editor, although I can't comment on the difficulty of making a map, because I have not tried to use it.-Making a new vehicle is especially difficult. Due to the way BeamNG.drive works, making a high quality vehicle is not as simple as importing a model. Unfortunately, many of the mods that are often seen in Youtube videos are examples of low-quality mods that are really only good for screenshots.-There are smaller, relatively easier to make mods as well, such as configurations for vehicles, new parts, and skins. For a better idea of what is possible, the BeamNG.drive forums has a spectacular selection of mods that can highlight the capabilities of BeamNG.drive.The recent 0.10 update overhauled the sound system, and massively improved it. If you were put off by the generic engine sounds in earlier versions, the 0.10 update and the new sounds are a significant improvement over the old sounds.The driving and physics simulation is outstanding, and is constantly being refined. Driving isn't just limited to roads either. Rock crawling, baja blasting, rallying, mudding, and even monster trucking is all possible. Honestly, the only thing limiting what you can do in the game is physics, and your imagination.That being said, this game is still in development, and when buying it you need to remember that new features are being added all the time. The big updates usually break a lot of mods, and it can be a pain going through downloaded mods and checking to see if they still work.In all, I would highly recommend BeamNG.drive to anyone who loves cars, and would similarly recommend it to anyone who enjoys physics simulations."

Ok well, If you dont know, This is a Realistic car driving simulator (that does not feel like an early access game), That allows you to Drive in many large maps and terrains with many different vehicles. Or thats what it claims to be. Although, its so much more, and its even comparable to Garrys Mod. ""How?"" you may ask? Well The feel of your first time getting in is very empty and simple. Almost like your first time playing Garrys mod without addons. That feel of Empty, and neat. That feel of addon lack. I like that feel. It gives me Old Garrys Mod nostolgia. So lets say you load up a map, well, all maps except the flat maps have many different types of terrain and difference. They are all nice looking and realistic. You get to Decide which vehicle to drive, crash, race, rp with, and so much more. And on the Default Game, there are so many vehicles to choose from, each type having another type to choose from. This sense of freedom and sandbox, again, just reminds me of garrys mod. And thats it, other than the addons. You have to get addons from some site which is kinda inconvienent. Why not just add on a workshop? Thats one of my complaints, the only other thing i really have to say is multiplayer would be amazing in this game, the AI is fun, but you cant tell them exactly what you want them to do. Anyways, Great Game! Looking forward to what more the Devs can Add into it."

And not just because of the soft body, but also because it is not as arcade as forza 3 is!It feels much more like a REAL car because you can swerve back and forth very fast if you are too fast! Swerving is not happening in Forza 3 in over 100 hours of playing! But in this game happens the same mistakes which happen if I drive with my real car! As exampe if I turn too fast, I cannot stay in the trace if Im too fast, also MUCH easier and more arcade within Forza Horizon 3!(it is called understeering/oversteering)Furthermore there are so many unexpected things can happen I cannot believe, it is a real happy car driving sandbox!!!

No microtransactions, not expensive, not overpriced, no other payments, no unlockables, everything is as it should and as advertised if not better. The realism is astonishing, Ive been following and playing this game since its first release in 2013. I remember playing the demo on first release. Long before it was on steam. This game has and always will be amazing. I kinda want multiplayer but I fear it may cause greed and ruin what I love about it. I hope it doesn't. The devs are very active consistently updating the game and do listen to their audience. They have always delivered. Nothing is rushed or abandoned unlike NextCarGame which came out not long after this and was good to begin with. I do feel it is missing sirens on emergency vehicles and could later on impliment proper air travel as well not just as flimsy mods not made by the developers. I have watched this game grow from day 1 and always loved it. Exactly what I want from a game. It can be very relaxing to drive around in what ever I want freely however I want and very exciting when I crash or fall off a cliff and turn my car into a box of splinters.100/10"

,Recommended,284160,28910753,Posted: 1 January,all,Chig: Baron of Beard,BeamNG is not so much a game as it's just a big sandbox in the purest term. There's no real goal unless you choose to participate in one of the few campaigns or scenarios.What makes BeamNG for me is the fact that I can pick a location. Pick a car. Pick a loadout. Pick a colour and just do whatever I feel like doing. Roll a 3 wheeler? There's a car for that. Tear up the tarmac? There's options for that. Tear up low-grip surfaces? There's loadouts for that. Do all of the above at the same time? Go nuts. You'll likely fail but the satisfaction of seeing your front wheel fly off because you bottled a corner is surprisingly long-lived.For fans of: Cars. Smashing cars. Rally. Car physics. Fun.

You can take a car that you want, like a 3-wheeled ""Pidgeon"" and drive on a test map to destroy it or on a real map like ""Utah"" that is giant and very well made.When you want you can play scenarios, that are missions where you have to drive a car you can't choose and reach some check points. This scenarios are stunts and challenges, and some of them are really hard to do.When you have played every scenarios you can go to the BeamNG website and download mods made from fans of the game, that can be cars, maps, scenarios and many others.

,Recommended,284160,35211807,Posted: 25 September,all,S̮̕ȗ͎m̼̌à͕n̻͋,"Where do I start?I strongly recommend this game to any petrol-heads or car fans out there. I might not be a good competitor for racing simulators, but it keeps its title as one of the most realistic soft-body physics games ever to come to public release.The physics in the game are insanely accurate and precise, you can replicate real-life crashes with surprisingly similar results.I would not really call this a game though... I would call it more like a Simulator, or Tool for soft-body physics.Again, for the petrol-heads and car fans, this game can teach a lot on how a car works, both outside and inside. In this game you can answer those weird questions about cars that you had in your childhood. How does a driveshaft work? How does tire-pressure change handling, all of this you can try out here, on any road surface you like.After spending half of my ""precious"" life on the internet, you can see that there are a lot of unanswered questions about cars, and how they behave. Back then in my childhood I used to have Mythbusters running and watched them do these experiments, from which I asked more questions. Like as an example:A car travelling at its top speed hitting a wall head on! Yeah, you can find this safety footage stuff on the internet with cars going city speeds crashing to weirdly shaped obstacles. But what many of us want to see is... Destruction! And it's true!You want to see how small you can crumble a van? BeamNG is for you!You want to test how big of an engine you can put in a small 3-wheeled car? BeamNG is for you!What about a drag race between identical cars with different tire-pressures? BeamNG is for you!Want to replicate popular race crashes? BeamNG... Yeah, I think you got the idea now.It is a great game with good balance in simulation and just having fun. You can not complain it to be too boring, because if that is so, it is not the fault of the game, it's the fault of your imagination. Because honestly? You can test pretty much anything related to vehicles in this game.Enjoy the game as much as you can, as there is lots of fun things to experiment with."

One very annoying one is when the tyres burst and it turns into a glitchy, terrifying instability that moves by itself...

Also, the developers seem to have a genuine interest in making sure to add more content when the old stuff gets stale; not to mention the commmunity is very active. They are also very diligent; game breaking bugs are fixed very quickly.The game dynamics make it very realistic in terms of drivability and damage modeling. However, if you're looking for a dedicated racing game this is far from the best option. However, it isn't a racing game. It's a fun, screw around and make your own content game.Make sure you have a good computer though. On my build (AMD A8 7650 and GTX 950) it can be a bit laggy.

It would be nice to have a few pre-sets I often found steering was difficult in a few cars (and I didn't understand what values/sliders to change to perhaps make it better)2) This is a really fun 'sandbox' but to me it's not quite a game, if you want to spend your hours crashing cars a lot or zooming around then I'd say go for it. There's a local multi-player mode but if you're like meand you don't have friends in real lifethat will play with you then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯3) The price is expensive in comparison to what you're getting, just a suggestion but I would say about £10-£12 for this game max and you'd probably find you'd get a lot more sales.I'll come back to this game in the future and just have another looksie and see if these points mentioned have been addressed in a way. Overall this game is very advanced and the physics are really well done and when you crash the damage feels so realistic.9/10"

Only real problem i see at this point is even in manual mode you can shift gears without using the clutch but i still use it anyways cause the clutch still works just isnt necessary. 10/10 the work they put on this game is amazing.Also i see people complain that the game is laggy and this because it is very CPU intensive so as long as you have a decent CPU you're fine

This is a extremely demanding simulator. This isn't because it is horribly optimized but because of the calculations your Pc has to make. One example of this is spawning in a vehicle that has 4000 beams. You may be thinking ""4000 beams that's nothing"" you are simulating 4000 beams but it's 2000 times every second 4000X2000 = 8,000,000 calculations I have a quad core 3.2 ghz processor it runs this perfectly fine2. If you aren't someone that can stand repetition this isn't for you. You repeat things alot.....well sort of. You do crash over and over but how you crash is what changes. You could do a vertical jump at 60 mph Hit a wall at 100mph or do a head on collision with each car going 150mph. It all depends on your mind. I've done nearly everything imaginable and I still come back to experiment.TLDR :don't like repeating don't get this if you're not creative and want to be directedThese PC specs run it good when my gpu isn't the issue (get something better)Built in 2015 (not the parts but assembly)I5-4460 @ 3.2ghz 3.4ghz MaxNvidia geforce 720 gtx 2gb8gb 1600 mhz ram280w power supply1tb 7200 rpm hard drive(Powersupply I know REPLACE IT but it is good enough)"

The game's physics are something to aw to, yes it may get boring at times, but if you become tense from another game, or just need something to consume time, this game can fulfill. If you have ever thought about a car crash that you'd want to see what would happen and see how it plays out then this is the game. I played the game for over 35 hours without mods (mainly because I couldn't figure it out) and I had fun with the game every time. Once I figured out how to use mods, oh boy, the gameplay and replayability doubled. I also love the fact they are updating the game and adding new stuff, the new items progressively getting better. There are a few downfalls though, mainly the game's framerate but that can always be solved by reducing the graphics, I've found that the dynamic reflections basically kill the game's framerate. If you turn that off It will run much smoother, and if not theres many other settings to toy around with. The app feature is also a fun feature, being able to customize the UIs you see while driving, whether it be the car's preformance, to it's damage, to just the ability to make the car fly across the map with wind. I also love how if you make a single mistake while driving, the car will go into a fishtail and either, fly off a cliff or, hit a tree causing the car to now look like a U. The scenerios are fun, but they aren't forced apon you inorder to play the game, which is amazing. this game is the definition of Open World. Everytime I play this i'm finding new ways to crash, crunch and demolish each car, and since they finally readded the AI feature ""Chase,"" Oh man I can't explain how much more fun police chases have become. I've bought this game twice the first being before steam, and the one on steam, not because I didn't know how to transfer my key from the off-steam Beamng.Drive, because I wanted to support the developers of this game. I can't recommend this game enough to all car enthusists, if you love driving cars and crashing them, then buy this game, just buy it and slam a drift tune car into a semi truck or install a mod and attach a car to the front landing gear of a plane and fly, fly like a freebird."

I've always loved this game, and I've wanted to play it for so long. I got this game about 4 months ago, in fact, I only made a Steam account so I could play this game as soon as I possibly could. Of course, there are some that dont like cars as much as others, but those people would still enjoy this game, I'd imagine, as watching stunts preformed or things getting blown up would catch their eyes instead of the highly in-depth car customization. This game is definately my favorite on Steam, even if its Early Access, the whole concept in astonishing, and if this is just the start of this game, then holy cow, us BeamNG.drive fans are in for a treat in the future. 5 out of 5 star rating. Would definitely recommend this game to any friend."

Destruction is very realistic and awesome.- Driving is realistic and fun.- Okay Modding + Easy Modding.- Not many updates but I do see them adding content or general updates every now and then.- Good offroading.- Fun at any framerate.Cons:- No Multiplayer.- I would like to see more vehicles be added to the game through the developers side, modding is okay but not perfect for this game. They did just release a new offroad vehicle that resembles a Jeep so it's good to know that they are workign on adding more vehicles to the game.- No aircraft or boats. This one I don't mind much at all or really care about but I think it would be great if they added planes, helicopters or boats into the game.- Sounds are, well, not the best. Some vehicles it fits while others it just doesn't. Mods do change some of the sounds but I think that the devs should work and fine tune the sounds a bit more.- Framerate can get low when you have a good amount of vehicles spawned in. For example, if I get 5-10 trucks on one map, I would experience a pretty high fps drop. It's not much of a gripe as it is fun at mostly every framerate, at least above 30.- Not a con but a recommendation, devs, please take out ""Free to Play"" from the game's tags. ;)System The Game Was Tested On:i5 6600k @3.5GHzGTX 1070 No Overclock16GB Deditated Wam240GB SSD"

But one day I saw the BeamNG Drive trailer and was impressed. And so for the first time in about 20 years, I bought a video game.  Yes, only a game this good could break my 20 year drought!This is seriously the best video game I have ever played! The game offers the rare combination of being simple yet profound. It's uncomplicated to play, but allows you to do so much. The producers continue to innovate with each new update, making the game better and better and more interesting. The graphics and maps are often visually stunning with incredible detail. Many of the maps are so interesting with so much to do, they could almost be separate video games themselves. Plus, I love how other people can create maps, vehicles and props for the game.I also love the flexibility the game provides. In free roam, you can make up your own missions and goals. As well, if you're short on time, you can teleport to any place on the map, rather than spend time driving there. One of the game's best features is the soft-body physics technology, which makes crashes exceedingly realistic. Plus, there are almost endless ways you can damage and crash your car. It never gets old! It's so powerful that rather than merely playing a game, you're having a new experience! Just be aware the game is demanding on your computer. A graphics card is recommended but not required, if you have a pretty good computer. However, a few minor  features in the game may not available without a graphics card.In sum, BeamNG Drive equals video games at their best. BeamNG Drive is the quintessential driving, crashing and racing video game and the gold standard. I believe this game will be the top video game of the 21st century. Don't miss out and give it a whirl!"

In particular I love the mods that let you drive on actual maps of real life roads.The customization is one of my favorite parts of this game because you take a stock car and throw a really powerful engine in it and bomb across the desert or slam a car to the ground with suspension parts and scrap across the parking lot.This game does wonders for stress relief because I just drive with no pressure through amazing maps."

More.Obviously, the soft body physics of the cars in the game are what make this game stand out from the rest, and is likely why you heard of this game. I know such becaus eit is how I came along this game in the first place. And this mechanic is really, really fun to mess around with, pushing the collisions to the max that the game, or even your PC can handle. And combined with an up to 100x slow mo, it becomes really satisfying to see the parts bend, shred and rip appart from the vehicle. On top of that, it's a car driving simulator, which means that the driving is also intended to be realistic. Not knowing how to drive myself, I cannot guarantee the realism, but many reviews here collectively claim so. This driving simulator really simulates everything about the car you drive in game, from the gears needing to be changed, to the engine being crushed as it was driven at 100 Mph into a concrete wall.And yet, amasingly, this is not all that this game has to offer. With new missions by the developpers that range in difficulty, as well as a handful of detailed maps (with Uhta being the best in I believe general opinion) on which you can drive sensibely or not, this barely scratches the surface of content that this game has to offer. In fact, this game has a seemingly endless amount of additionnal content, free of charge, entirely thanks to a massive modding community who regurgitate a constant flow of new things to play with.And these guys, well, they do EVERYTHING. Vehicles, objects, maps, car modifications, sounds, AI upgrades, flying planes, missions and so, so much more. This game may cost 23 euros right now, but this is 23 euros of limiteless content. And this is why I believe that this game is one that you should at least pick up to try if you are interested in the game. With this much free content at such a low price, it can bring so many hours of fun alone or with friends.I may not have all that many hours on this game compared to others (about 50hrs at time of review), but it is enough to know if I will keep playing this game for many more or never again. And trust me, if you read this review in several months/years, and the number of hours I have on this game have not highly risen, I'm either dead, or held a gun point to never play this game again. And then I would be dead, because it's that good."

And the tutorial doesn't really do an amazing job at teaching you how to do specific moves and turns. Especially when you later play other scenarios that require you to do small tight turns. 9 thumbs bump in the rump out of 10 bumps.

If you are looking for a all-out multiplayer racing game or a game with insane graphics, this isn't it. There is however a strong modding community, plenty of simulation tools, customization, and a surprising learning curve to driving in BeamNG. Your 1970s muscle car is going to handle quite differently than a 2010 compact car. For someone who loves the idea of having the choice between doing time trials, freeroaming up and down the Utah highways, or smashing expensive supercars into walls for hours, I definitely would reccomend."

76561197993437321,Recommended,284160,28693774,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Carm3D,"It's not a complete game yet, but I recommend it.  The game has evolved since I bought into it's Early Access; so it is not abandonware.The soft-body damage sim system is bloody fantastic and deep.  Not completely realistic, but fantastic.  I'm sure you've seen YouTube videos of BeamNG.drive crashe motages and cars tumbling down mountains getting all smashed up.  The only thing missing is the ability for cars to explode.  They never do.  All they do is sometimes catch fire if you rupture the fuel tank.While this is not yet finished, there is a very large selection of activities (scenarios) you can do.  Checkpoint races, jumping, stunts, destruction missions and other ways to take advantage of the game's unique and extensive soft-body vehicle engine.  There is plenty to do here; it's just not a complete game yet.  The game is also highly moddable so you can create your own scenarios and even 3D props and tracks if you know your way around a 3D modeling program.The game's configuration and control options are DEEP.  It works spectacularly with the Steam Controller once you can figure out how to configure it all.  Steering with the track pad feels great.  The only thing better would be a real steering wheel controller.  Some day!The game's graphics are not state of the art, but they are very crisp.  Let's say crisp but a bit dry.  It would benefit from some ambient occlusion, physically based rendering or other cutting-edge graphic engine elements.  If the game had the graphics engine of Rocket League or Mad Max it would be a very impressive thing indeed.  But what is here is very servicable.  The frame rate is silky smooth on my GTX960.  On the other hand the amount of trees and other foliage around the road is impressive.Now for the negatives.  The game has a beginnings of a campaign.  Appropriately named ""Rocky Start.""  The actual gameplay is fun.  It has the beginnings of an open-world map with activities you can choose with rewards.  Great stuff.  But the presentation...  It is disjointed.  They chose to use cartoonish, 2D flash-type animations to lead into each part of the campaign.  The art is flatly drawn cartoons.  The people...  I'm sorry.  They look like they tapped someone from DeviantArt.  Crudely drawn cartoons.  The animation looks very low-budget.  This directly contrasts with the actual game world where everything is dimensional, lush, detailed and obviously lovingly crafted.  The 2D art really brings the game down a peg.  And there is other 2D art within another part of the game that is far superior.  They should sack the new artist and use the first one.  Yeah it had the limitations of being 2D but it has style and looks much more professional..  Ugh.. Sorry.. as an artist it's just a pet peeve of mine.  If you aren't going to do it right, don't do it at all.Pros:+ Soft-body physics engine produces AMAZING crashes!+ Skill-based driving and racing.  Watch out for that rock on the side of the narrow road.  It will end your car!+ Variety of activities with a large range of difficulties to choose from+ Nicely crafted (fictional) car models+ Pretty well detailed environments to drive or race through+ Awesome stunts & jumps+ Deep control configurability / Great with Steam Controller+ Free-roaming and wrecking is relaxing fun+ It does not seem like it will become abandonware so farCons:- It's not finished yet (as expected for Early Access).- Graphics engine does not look as good as it could (yet?)- No explosions (yet?)- Ugly, low-budget animated intro segments that are thankfully skippable."

That is what makes this game so much fun. Seeing what you can do with the simulation and testing the cars - usually by smashing them. The only thing I have against this game is, I wish that there were more cars by the Dev. I know that there are lots of cars you can add as mods, but It would just be nice if there were more right away when getting the game.

This is mostly a sandbox game, letting you play with cars and physics. Fantastic physics actually. This is not really a racing game, even though you actually can race on circuits and test many different gameplays & scenarii.This game is little difficult to grasp at the beginning, but extremely fun once you get it. The point here is physics simulation: so you load a map, select a car, insert objects and other vehicles. Eventually, you end up bouncing in bumps, doing stupid things, getting the proper response from the physics engine, and finally your car is broken in a unique manner. Then, you simply respawn where you want, or take the wheel of another spawned car.Please remember this game is EARLY ACCESS, so it is even before BETA status. Everything is still in the making, so do not expect a finished product or something too user-friendly. You will need to subscribe a BeamNG account in order to dowload tons of mods for almost anything: cars, UI mods, environments, etc.TL;DR: once you know what you get, this game is JUST FANTASTIC. There is nothing like this game: a physics simulator for cars that can endorse many purposes, from racing to destruction derby."

The crashes are fantastic to watch, and the physics are great. But this game does have a couple problems and improvements that could be made.Pros:-Looks good.-Runs fairly well, but isn't the best at optimization.-Physics are fun.-Crashes are fantastic.-Has a photo mode.-Lots of different scenarios and environments.-Good selection of props and vehicles, it even has a cannon.-Has a practice track.Neutral:-Physics are still a little strange, but has improved a bunch.-Looking/changing your key bindings can be a little confusing.-Menu is still confusing.Cons:-Still has bugs, including the occasional crash.-Controls are still wonky and aren't explained very well.Tl;dr, if you want a crashing/driving simulator, then this is the way to go. But only buy if you have a decently powerful machine and don't mind the strange physics and controls."

I personally adore sandboxes, just because you can do whatever you want. The fact that you can download mods makes it even better, you are actually encouraged to install mods and expand the possibilities to the max. I don't have a drivers license, so I can't say much about how the verhicles handle in comparison with real ones, however, I know enough about physics to say that it is pretty damn good. For example, when you brake slowly without slipping instead of completely burning your tires, you will actually brake faster because the braking force is higher. When you accelerate when your vehicle is flying through the air, you won't see your actual speed because your tires don't touch the ground. Next to all those details you can also place small apps on the screen that show engine info, like the force from the engine itself, the force from the tires, windspeed, weight, G-force, etc. etc. The game does contain some minor bugs, but because it is still an early access game, I don't mind.Overall: 7,5/10"

Most community created cars are done well though and are very fun to play with in this smash em' up car simulator. One thing I'm sad about is that there is no community workshop for this game for user created cars and maps so you have to download from theirwebsite. Even still, installation of community creations is very simple; just a drag and drop of a folder. There are some missions for you to play where you can drive through checkpoints and do jumps and all, but besides that, there is no objective other than what you make up. You can test your car's durability as hard as you want with this game. It gives you complete freedom of how to smash your car, always with a satisfying result and that is why recommend this game."

Using a steering wheel seriously brings the game out to a new light. Even just mindlessly driving or doing cargo transport missions can be refreshing and relaxing.There is no instagram filter on this game, no gimmick which sticks the vehicles to rules. This is a fully natural, barebacking vehicle and physics simulator.Get a steering wheel, buy this game, let the community grow"

Entirely in principle it is possible to see it also in other games. For example emphasis is put on system of damage which looks not bad, but not at the top level. In my opinion it would be possible to impose more grounds on the car and by that there would be even more realistic specification of damage (if has gone to that and to place emphasis on damages)The schedule in a game at the good level but after all could be added a variety of landscapes and infrastructure of the current route. Infrastructure needs to be finished in my opinion seriously. To pay bigger attention to other moving objects in a game less static routes.In general this very original and unusual game which I very much hope will be brought to perfectionAs the car simulator from my point of sight - a game is made perfectly! Management in a game is made excellently!Я не буду безумно восторгаться этой игрой,с учётом того что она в раннем доступе она не сильно привносит сногсшибательных эмоций вождения автомобилем.Всецело впринципе это можно видеть и в других играх.Например упор сделан на систему повреждения которая выглядит неплохо, но не на высшем уровне.На мой взгляд можно было бы больше наложить полигонов на машину и тем самым было бы ещё более реалистичная детализация повреждения(если на то уж пошло и  делать упор на повреждения)Графика в игре на хорошем уровне но всё-таки можно было добавить разнообразие ландшафтов и инфраструктуру текущей трассы.Инфраструктуру нужно на мой взгляд  серьёзно доработать.Большее внимание уделить другим движущимся обьектам в игре и меньше статичных трасс.В целом эта очень оригинальная и необычная игра которая я очень надеюсь будет доведена до совершенстваКак симулятор автомобиля с моей точки зрения- игра  сделана великолепно!Управление в игре сделано превосходно!"

This game gives a very early peak at what can very easily become a reality in future racing games, and perfects it. Although there is a slight lack in content and handful of bugs, it can very easily be forgiven with its state. I know this game will get better and better with the developers that listen to the community and respond to questions very often.--RATING--100/125"
76561198209111955,Recommended,284160,25784009,"Posted: 30 September, 2016",all,[No]skill,"I recommend this game to anyone who is in search of a crash simulator, a driving simulator, a game with realistic In-Depth car customisation or just a way to pass some time if you dont want to bother loading into any other game.So far I have played almost 80 hours of this game, which is a fairly high amount for me and actually more than I have played GTA V. I have installed quite a few mods and lokked deep into the vehicle customization.Just a few things you can do in the game:-Simulate crashes with (on my PC) up to six vehicles (which can have a rudimentary AI)-Just drive around and relax-Create your very own dream vehicle from models roughly resembling real life cars-Race around various tracks included in some of the maps-Finetune your suspension in terms of ride height, spring stiffness, track width and more-Install dozens of mods, some of them with incredibly high quality-explore the detailed maps, find all the secret passages- ... and quite a lot more!As far as I can tell, the game runs very smoothly until you spawn to many cars (6 on my PC), it looks great even on lower graphical settings and has a FoV-Slider so TotalBiscuit will be happy. Extremely high velocity/force impacts don't look that great, but are still a accurate depiction of what would happen to a similar car (despite some parts clipping through others bended textures/Jbeams etc...) Aside from that crashes in this game are almost worthy of next generation car testing. E.g. brake thermals and cooling liquids and other stuff gets simulated.Stuff you should know:Though it's possible to play this game with a keyboard you will have a hard time controlling especially the stronger/older car variants. This is because a keyboard limits you to full throttle, none at all and hard braking. The best option would be a steering wheel,but a contoller also works just fine. The game has force feedback compatibility in general, however this doesn't apply to my ancient  SpeedLink wheel.There is a experimental replay feature, but it's still a buggy mess. I guess it will be fixed very soon, look out for that.Which brings me to my next point: The game gets updated regularly (a major content patch comes out every 1/2 months, of high quality, with bugfixes, optimisations and like I said, content). BeamNG also has a very nice and helpful community.What I don't like as of now:-The sounds (which have been described as placeholders by the devs) are plain horrible, but they said that they hired asound effects guy in the last devblog.-The particles are not all that detailed and plenty compared to real car crashes-The game tends to bug out sometimes, nothing major, but it's there and its annoying"

Crashing seems really good if you have seen real crashes- Cars. You can choose in Early access many cars not just few like many other sandbox games gives us.- Car Tuning.  In some cars you can tune them a lot! it makes it really interesting :)NEGATIVE- Driving :(   Sadly the driving isnt really good and you lose your grip REALLY easily. driving in a normal road 60km/h and wosh you are in the tree next time..- Scenarios.  Scenarios becomes negative just because the driving.. some Scenarios are really fun and cool but when you get a road what is jumpy as hell.. you just cannot keep your car straight it just keeps going to the tree in no time.- AI.  The bot driver mostly these Scenarios where you are a Police this AI can be smart or just really really stupid.. there isnt much where you versus bot is but I hope there will be more..Yeah this game isnt now or never will be made for Racing or do missions etc but I hope :) its a good start and I believe it will be good in the end..7/10 would cry more but tired

I have a 4.0 on my graphics processor (I obviously don't play lots of games on my PC), and unfortunately I lag a lot on maps other that the empty, infinite one, and the testing area with the half pipes and stuff. <-- (Sorry, I forgot the names of the maps..)

Lots of cars to choose from, and a multitude of objects to use to crash in millions of different ways on tons of different maps.The only issues? Mods. The only mods that work are the ones that are simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥ modded versions of the standard cars in the game that you get by default. Want a real world car? I've tried 3 different methods, and none of them worked.The game runs amazing, and it looks awesome too. But the menus within the game take an hour to navigate through because they are buggy and are very laggy.This game heavily pushes mods as its largest feature, but it fails to deliver because there is no workshop and hardly any mods work, and all mods offered by the community are boring or ""outdated."" It's the lack of this that makes the game a little boring and even frustrating at times.Other than that, the game is absolutely incredible. All of the many worlds you can choose to drive around in are enourmous, and take hours to fully explore. This makes the game fun, replayable, and its a damn good game if you just want to hop in a vehicle and explore a vast and expansive world.Overall, the experience is incredible and I love every minute of it. Even when you crash, it's utterly satisfying to watch as it is as realistic as it gets in driving games of this generation. Like smashing things? Like driving around? Like realism? Then get yourself this game, because it delivers all three in a perfect package."

The campain is still a work in progress, there is no multiplayer, and there really aren't that many cars. However, there are TONS of mods and maps and other cars to download and use, and once you get those up and running, the game gets pretty fun.Overall about a 7/10, but probably will be higher once the campain is out and if they add a multiplayer."

76561198046472166,Recommended,284160,29577754,Posted: 29 January,all,Banjofrawg,"After a couple of mods I put some Glen Miller on my Amazon account and was cruising around Roane County, Tennessee in a gold Grand Marquis with Mississippi plates. I'm really looking forward to career mode and any other additions that the devs come up with. It's a great engine with nearly unlimited possibilities.Recommended:1) Get a controller and set the throttle and brake to pressure sensitive triggers. It's way easier to control acceleration and braking.2) Download the Roane County, Tennessee map.  It's enormous with good clean roads and several destinations. I'm hoping the creator of that mod stays interested. You can literally drive for miles with interesting destinations.3) The license plate mod was fun for me. I went from a Honda CRX style mod with Minnesota plates to my Mississippi Grand Marquis. It's a small thing, but indicative of the personalization possibilities of this engine.4) Get a plane mod. The one I got is a little hard to control at first, but once you get the hang of it, it felt pretty realistic.PROS:1) Almost limitless possibilities.2) Excellent driving physics, apart from maybe early mph drift. I felt like I shouldn't be sliding sometimes at 35mph.3) Fully destructible vehicles.4) Good looking graphics.5) Active mod community. I've been able to find most of what I've looked for.CONS:1) Can be a bit glitchy, but its a work in progress.2) Above stated possible early speed traction loss.3) Gets a bit lonely without other traffic or multiplayer. My young son and I were pretending to be the last survivors of an apocolypse.4) I worry a bit about what sort of PC capabilities this is going to need. Mine is a pretty recent ROG with a 970, and I can feel a strain if I pull too many vehicles on a map. I don't think it would run well on even a moderately dated machine.Overall, it's an easy recommend. There is enough content available from the devs and mods right now to make it fun, but the real deal is waiting to see what they come up with next. They've created an entire possible world, and now I want to see what they put in it. Career mode, multiplayer, more mods... It's going to be fun. Buy the game, have fun with what it is now, and fund further develpment all at the same time."

Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ingredients1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar3/4 cup sugar2 large eggs1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour3/4 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon fine saltDirections1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.For a Rocky Road Bar:1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve."

Some games have poor models and most have none at all. Then I found BeamNG.drive. It is by far the best car physics  simulator out there. Not only does it have fully detailed cars with all the correct parts, but it also has a  customization feature for you to basicaly build your own car. I would definitely reccommend this game to anbody who loves cars, driving, or just general destruction."

,Recommended,284160,34515485,Posted: 26 August,all,Eclipse0987,"God, never have I seen an indie game this good.For no funding, this game beats a AAA game, with no competition. With 0.10 released, sh*t hit the fan. Not only did they add in a Photo mode, they revamped ALL of the engine noises, and they're amazing. Each car has it's individual sound, and they're all of incredible quality. The physics are realistic, to the point where people have made comparisons of real life and this game, and they were neck-and-neck similar. Sure, it's CPU-consuming, but this gameplay is fantastic. Then there are the crashes. People have made MILLIONS of views on crashes in this game, and for good reason. Mindless destruction is fun, and I love the 'Hinges' and 'BOOM' selections in the Circular Menu thingy. Just to watch the hinges on the car melt into nothing and the gas tank to f*cking implode like somebody infused a lighter with the gas in your car is satisfying as hell.I have logged 50+ hours into the game, and it's only gonna grow. But the things I would like include:A replay editor. This includes, but is not limited to: the last 3-5 minutes of gameplay recorded, multiple options of camera angles, FOV slider, (not that hard) or an AutoCam, for people that are too lazy to place down markers/keyframes and just wanna watch. I drift like a hardass, so it would be cool to share it with my friends who ask me why I play the game so much.Performance improvements. I love this game, and sure I have a GeForce 930M, and an i5, but it still struggles to get over 30+fps. CPU goes up to 60% usage, even on low settings. The WiiU did it, so why not?More vehicles. I love these vehicles, but I often scour the interwebz trying to fing a car that I like/is decent. These community mods are great, but most of them are concepts, beta mods, or, of course, outdated. Maybe base them off real cars, like the 1969 Dodge Charger being the Bruckell Defender.Then there's multiplayer. Straight up, I. DON'T. NEED. IT. Multiplayer costs time, money, (a lot of it) and a whole team even to get it into beta. Split screen has already been implemented, (for months) but nobody knows about it. Online multiplayer costs a fortune and a leg combined to get working, but to see it implemented will be a huge, huge HUGE accomplishment.My conclusion: WHY THE F*CK HAVE MORE PEOPLE NOT BOUGHT THIS YET? I was around since 0.8. I tried the Tech Demo, loved it, bought it off Steam, full price. I love it to this day.12,000/10, f*ck school, I'm pretending to be sick to play this all day."

It's Red Faction for cars, with plenty to mess around with, though lacking any objective outside of short missions varying from driving routes to disabling ai vehicles, seperate from the free-roam structure that you would spend most of your time in. There are frequent updates and an interesting modding community, adding plenty of tracks and vehicles.There are a few negatives in it's lack of objective and the mildly annoying camera, plus physics crashes, ui bugs and unresponsive controls do happen relatively often, but overall I'd still recommend it to anyone."

As a scientist and gamer, I'm simply flabbergasted at both the concept and execution of this game/software.At the moment, it seems to drive as well as a good racing sim and I'm having a lot of fun, especially on the rally tracks. The developers are taking a scientific approach in testing their tire model and the results are quite convincing. It is however missing a transmission model with manual clutch, but I believe it should be coming soon.The spectacular collisions and damage modeling are simply a result of the physics engine, which also supports pressurized vessels, aerodynamics (good enough to fly a plane!), engine thermodynamics, etc... Example: riding a rally track I bumped the front; oil leak. 30s later my engine dies! No need to mention what happens when you clip the sidewalk.I have only a few hours played, and there is a lot of content (cars + tracks + props). The EA period is not over, with improvements and more content on the way.

,Recommended,284160,23187787,"Posted: 24 May, 2016",all,Jallen,"Let me start by saying something that would have interested me before buying -- This is not a realistic driving simulation -What do I mean by this? Every part of the car is physically simulated, each part can break off, be bent etc. It's a very complicated and fairly realistic simulation. As such the behaviour of the cars is entirely dependent on this physics simulation being near perfect - but although it is very good, it is far from perfect.Every car massively understeers, even at low speeds I know from experience driving a car every day to and from work would be absolutely nowhere near breaking traction. In the AWD cars they easily oversteer because of the lack of control at the front wheels. I believe this is due to slight instabilities of the physics simulation - I have seen the front wheels spasming under load and as such they do not maintain friction like they would in a real car.So it's a great physics simulation which is a ton of fun. The damage and crashes are great. But it doesn't come close to being a good driving simulation like DiRT Rally.I recommend this game, but not if you are after a realistic driving sim."

I tested it out, and in every car they give you, if you just press on the throttle, the car immediately does donuts. Nothing else. I believe the cars in beamNG were only programmed to hit the nearest wall before they reach high enough speeds to be any fun by how horribly they respond to commands such as basic steering and braking.

So much thought and effort went into making the crashes feel so realistic, its incredible. But I didn't pay 25 dollars for realistic crashes.

That's inexcusable, you shouldn't be able to NOT drive a car, in a driving game. Apparently this is due to some update that changed the gearbox behavior, I tried arcade and realistic modes, driving aids on and off, and I could see that the clutch pedal wasn't being depressed no matter I tried.Next is sound, I didn't have any sound, don't know why, don't care, not spending time fixing it.Graphics? Very dated, probably won't get better seeing how slow development is. The UI is also atrocious, it's very unintuitive, hard to read and frustrating, with the simplest things being made difficult like going back to the main menu.Physics?

That was a decision I wish I hadn't made. The game looked very cool on youtube and stuff, but when I actually played it, it was not so fun. It was difficuly to control the cars and the game itself, and most of the scenarios built in are boring except for the crashing ones.PROS:Good physics engineRealistic car crashesCONS:Difficult to control carsDifficult to control overall gameplayRedundant scenariosGets old very fastIn conclusion, I would think twice before spending $25 on this game that will get old fast.

Coupled with unpredictable steering in general, the game is extremely difficult to enjoy.Try making a slight turn in a small car going 40km/h on dry asphalt in real life, and in the game. In real life, the car will turn as much as you turn the wheel, as expected. In BeamNG.drive, the car will less, then proceed to lose all traction and spin out of control. I must completely disagree to any claim that the handling is realistic. Anyone with a driver's license should agree.The game also does not explain anything to you other than the absolute most basic controls. It's a small gripe. I would be okay with googling all of the games features to figure them out, but I'm not sure it would be worth it since the vehicles are nearly uncontrollable anyway. Also, the game's performance is not very good, either.I will be requesting a refund right after I submit this review."

I don't think I've seen a car game that has this amount of detail and animation in the damage that goes into the car. The free-roam section of the game was pretty enjoyable.Sadly, the game itself doesn't deliver the entertainment that the game trailers showcase. Waited over a year to purchase this game since I knew this game would be buggy when it first arrived on early access, 13 months later and its still buggy. and nothing to do apart from free-roam destroying cars.

Smashy physics just isn't enough.Edit : I appears as though it's just the feeling of control with a controller is more my issue. I'm leaving my comments above the same as they were my first reaction. I think this game with a wheel setup would be great. I did refund it, but that's because I lack a proper wheel and pedal setup for my PC.Look in the comments and you can see the dev replied to this, and quickly. So you can see that there is a great deal of care for this game and the developer is paying attention. There is a lot of game here.

The front end doesn't want to turn, and the back end loves to slide out in front of you.  Once you start to lose control (which is every time you try to turn even a little), you can forget about ever getting it back.  Again: like driving on ice.  Sure, the point of the game is crashing, but crashing is only fun when you do it on purpose.  The lack of realistic control over your vehicle makes it difficult to even set up the high speed crash you want.  Instead, I spend most of my time sideswiping guard rails at 30 mph because I couldn't navigate the simplest little S-curve.  To make matters worse, on any kind of bumpy terrain (like the cliffs map), your car will bounce around like a slightly stale tennis ball, breaking its radiator and an axle or two, preventing you from getting to the cliff you wanted to drive off.  Ugh!Also, the damage modeling is just not THAT cool.  Your car crumples up like a wadded up paper ball, with bumpers and doors flapping in the breeze as you blow down the road.  Sure it's in Early Access, but for $24.99, I cannot possibly recommend this game.  If you see it for $5 or less, it would make an OK time-waster."

,Not Recommended,284160,21917158,"Posted: 18 March, 2016",all,OmarAbdulHasanAliShaheedMohammed,"So a few months ago this was one of my favorite games. Easily in my top 10 and i would have recommended it to anyone who likes crash driving style games.Sadly there are a few reasons (nit picky but do make a difference at least to me) that makes me PERSONALLY not enjoy it as much as id likeNow heres when i wish steam had a different review system, because i would normally say go ahead get this game give it a try and i will tell you that. Buy it, give it a try if you like crash mechanic driving games. But first here me out and maybe if the issues i list are something that REALLY bother you, you may save yourself some money and timeFirst off the game itself is really good, its fun and its gotten so far and for the most part its going in a good direction. hopefully down the line i can fix my issuesNote im using MPH for my speedsNow onto why i downvoted this gameThe camera angles lets start are absolutely DREADFUL. When you are turning or hit something, the camera switches into weird stupid angles like a down up view or a top view which DOESNT HELP when im trying to DRIVE. And when you attempt to adjust it, well then it gets wonky. So what they tried and failed at is when you back up the angle switches to the back view so you dont have to do it manually (i hate that) and thus makes it much harder to do what would normally be simple manuevers. When you start to drive forward again it puts the camera back, however if at any point you alter it before then it will still re adjust itself, but will adjust itself according to what you did. Bit hard to explain but lemme try in more detailSay you are facing forward and lets say its North, as you back up the camera switches to facing South, and as you drive it forward switches back to North. Now if you say as you back up turn the camera yourself (while still backing up) and face the camera North while backing up its all fine. BUT once you start to move forward the camera still thinks it facing South, when it really isnt. So as you go forward it switchs to what it THINKS is North but is really South. So instead of all manuel camera switching it just goes all wonky on you. Basically think of it like this, whatever angle the camera turns itself it will turn back the way it came, so if it makes  180 turn it will turn 180 back again to fix it. But if you already turned the camera yourself and its facing where you want it to be facing the game still thinks it needs to turn 180 and does so thus putting weird angles that you have to fix that can and will mess you up alot.Next is braking/steeringThis part is a core part of the game its basically how you drive, and since its a driving game this is incredibly importantThe braking in this game is trash. The cars will drift and turn at the slightest brake and can take a long time to brake as well.Steering. The game was always a bit bad at this but now it seems worse ive got cars going 30 and i turn a smidge and boom drift city. Its annoying and basically makes it to were i cant actually turn without slowing down to a crawl (and in this case that can take 10 seconds to brake)Lastly crash mechanicsSo i sometimes get my car glitched into rocks and other cars which is stupid but happens rarely. I also notice i can scrape a car against a wall going like 40 or so and it says something stupid like ""engine malfunction tires flattened) and then i lose all control of my car. Now imagine hitting something going that fast and not scraping it. Ya, really ruins the gameTLDRThe camera angle auto adjusting and actualy car control are absolutely terrible and is the reason for why it takes out of the fun, immersion. and overall satisfaction for me. Im sure many will enjoy this game but i dont and until these issues are addressed will keep my vote at a thumbs down"

Every vehicle including mods all seem to flip over violently if you try to turn to sharp over 15 mph (which is confusing in a stadium truck).

,Not Recommended,284160,30906122,Posted: 2 April,all,deeplogic,"This game is about crashing - well, let me rephrase: This game is about damage. If you aren't crashing, you're trying to damage another vehicle. While there are some race scenarios, they don't live-up to any other racing simulator. While I like that the game has realistic damage, frankly, I think they've spent a lot of time on something that nobody ultimately cares much about; that is, unless you just wanted to crash something anyway. They're seeing bottlenecks with the number of vehicles and, guess what, that's why nobody details out the phsyics to this degree in the first place.When I first saw the game, I thought, ""Wow, that's cool - when they get it all buttoned up, it'll be great."" Well, you know what? Sure, it will be great six years down the road when we get up to the level of computing power needed to run this game with a full set of opponents and features that other simulators have. By then, they'll probably find there's a much easier way to accomplish what they're doing, or, heck, maybe they have done something unique and that future whatever will be based on their code, but it's not worth wasting your money on in the interim. Well, again, unless you just want to crash some things.I'm also not quite sure why folks are talking up the graphics so much - they're okay, but nothing spectacular. I feel like I'm sacrificing almost every other gameplay mechanic and visual effect (even with everything turned all the way up) for an overly detailed impact and nothing more. And, even with all this focus on realism, running into a ditch and climbing up bushes feels like a swing and a miss.So, at the end of the day, while this provides for some realistic crashes, I feel like I got about $5 bucks worth of enjoyment and wish I could demand back the other $20. I can't recommend this game.UPDATE-------------The developer left a comment and noted that this was a vehicle simulator. I see nothing in my review that seemed to suggest I thought otherwise; the phrase ""other racing simulator"" was referring to the race scenarios. The later reference to ""other simulators"" was directed at others such as these, not the racing simulators mentioned earlier.They also stated that the crashes are a by-product, so, folks, to address that: If you want to drive a car down a road, not straying for fear of crashing, of course, or engage in a couple scenarios where you have to cause another vehicle to wreck, without crashing your own, then, by all means, have at it kiddos!What did I expect when I bought this, then, you may ask? I expected an open-world vehicle simulator as described on the store page. I expected to drive through vast areas, being able to engage in missions to get parts to upgrade my vehicle. I hoped for a garage and a large map with miscellaneous contacts and interesting scenery. What I got was a menu with some maps, each ""open-world"" as they largely allow you to navigate to any point (bushes, though, are made of steel apparently and will not allow traversal), and a car configuration menu with a bunch of settings I didn't want to modify. The game looks cobbled together and didn't live up to expectations. And, no, I can't get a refund as the developer suggested because I spent too much time in the game looking for all these wonderful promises.Summary: If you want to race, don't buy it. If you want to crash, buy it, but know that's not the point. If you want to wreck other vehicles, and not crash, buy it. If you want to engage in pseudo-meaningful interactions to make you feel like you need to continue playing this, don't buy it."

It looks like a game created by one guy over the course of 6 months, and has that amount of content. Where is the story? Where is the campaign? What are you people doing over there for god's sake?Look. This game is one of the most well-funded games today. If the studio itself can't do it, can't put the final level of polish (or even ANY level of polish), nevermind put an actual game in what amounts to an extremely barebones proof-of-concept physics simulator, then they have the money to hire two other studios of 50 people to finish the job for them in 2 years flat if not less! They are renegging on their own promise, are an embarassment to themselves, and need to kick their behinds into gear not today, not yesterday, but 2 years ago. They are mind-numbingly behind and need to get back to actual work, because whatever they're doing, it's an embarassing effort worth a university student, not one of the most well funded games today."

The game lags to a point it freezes for a second or two. and thats on a Titan X!! (at 4K with AA off). Second the game has no real purpose, there is no racing its just crash a car in a few different laggy ways. Also once you crash you have to drop a fresh car and if you crashed way off course you have to restart the whole thing.  I've also tried to start many times only to have the game showing me no road and glitched out graphics causing me to restart. Other times I would start enjoying the game, drop another car to witness an awesome crash only to have the car stop working for no reason. Not to mention the camera that just non stop goes all over the place as you drive. Speaking of driving, the cars themselves drive like they are on black ice. Front wheel drive cars start to drift out of control at 20 Mph. These guys deserve credit for the physics engine they have created.

If you're one of those people who enjoy the Burnout series for the destruction and games with physics, this is for you.  The accidents are extremely realistic, and I feel the handling is too. There's lots of content made by users, and it's high quality too. Doesn't require a great GPU, but you want 8GB or more RAM because of all the processing it does. It won't even run on less than 4GB of RAM.Installing mods is as easy as it can be. It's literally drag and drop a zip archive.I only have 2 complaints. The first is the lack of DLC. I'd totally pay money to get some more cars. Yes there is free content on different sites but they're mainly popular vehicles as opposed to mainstream ones. I'd love to crash my own car as messed up as that sounds. The other one is the controls. There's no way to access and browse the side menu from a controller. Not a huge deal but worth noting because it means I can't just play it with a 360 controller from my TV.Overall, it's worth every penny. Now all I need is a boat version of this so I can finally live my dream of being on the sinking Titanic.I will update this as I play more."

You can manually set up a controller (using a ps4 controller currently) but there's just so many options, and the throttle seems to be all or nothing, that definitely needs to be fixed.Faster cars just spin out no matter what because you can't half-throttle.Otherwise, as-is, for $24.99, I'd give it a 7/10.

Stunning physics, amazing customization, excessive destruction and a distinctly dedicated modding community. The game in sandbox version is more fun to me than any other automotive game I own. One of the best parts for me is checking everytime I log into steam for a news bulletin or update, simply because the new features and changes always make the game more enjoyable. This game has endless potential and the devs are on the forefront of successful early access games.Overall, if you like destruction, driving simulation or car customization spend the money (I recomend quickly visiting the BeamNG website for a deal as well as ensuring you have a capable PC) and I garuntee you wont regret it."

It accuratly simulates all aspects of cars from crashing to suspension and handling. Cars are constructed out of hundreds of nodes linked together with ""beams"" that simlulate all aspects of the vehicle from the frame to the bodywork. the meshes are simply bound to to these ""beam-node groups"" (hence the name) so that you get hyper realistic deformation in a crash. This unusual method of construction leads to highly realistic dynamic handling of cars. As you remove suspension components your car will start to behave compleatly diffrently then before. Damage to the frame can also lead to messed up alignment and difficulty in handling the car. The engine however, can never be destroyed, even if it is half out of the twisted mess that was once your car. Beamng.drive, for all it's virtues is somewhat of a one trick pony. If you do not like mangling cars, you will not enjoy the game. If you do though, you can get hours of fun out of creating increasingly inventive crashes to watch play out. I reccomend crushing several dumpy hatchbacks between a cement truck and a barrier. The game also comes with an unbelivably powerful map editor, and a wealth of mods exist for it insuring that you will never run out of things to smash. If you have ever played Rigs of Rods, this game is esentally Rigs of Rods on steroids. If you haven't, check it out, its free. Overall, I really reccomend this game. Worth every cent, and more."

Unfortunately, words are all I have.BeamNG.drive can be directed to different types of gamers/car sim enthusiasts. For example, you can modify the parts of a vehicle (provided the vehicle's parts are available to the game). Or, you can simply drive around and smash your car over and over again. On the other hand you can build tracks, or set up events to challenge yourself and others. In turn, this game may only be in Alpha, but it already covers a wide spectrum.A key point that should be made is the level of realism in its physics and damage infliction. I wish I could figure out how to spew concrete blocks at other vehicles simply because it is that realstic...As of now there are two modes available: Scenario and Freeroam. Scenario is simply different scenarios designed to challenge you. Freeroam allows you to drive, test, crash, design, crash, and crash.I mostly ramble, but I will conclude with this game being a must have for the people that enjoy games with cars. Alpha contains enough to captivate and excite. Highly recommend."

Try out their demo on the BeamNG website - it gives a sense of the game and allows you to try the physics out before you buy it."

Now I can crash cars with life-like physiscs, and not die. My tv is my monitor across the room, as I type this review from the can and continue to play Beamng across the room. Endless fun crashing in different ways and getting into realistic police chases. This game runs smoother than my chocolate faucet!! This is a game I would recommend.For real though,There are a lot of great things about this game.Here are some of my pros and cons and ideas and improvments for future updates!Note: This is all in my opinion. You may agree or disagree.+Ideas:+Hook rope/chain to other vehicles. Some demolition derby's I have seen tow a car via chain and use that to whack other cars.+Add scratches and paint damage. This would be a decent idea. not good, not bad, but decent.+Add a ""record"" type feature, to record the movement for the AI. Make multiple cars drive the way you want them. Have a play button and reset button to reset the recorded cars. Good for making videos.+Add a speed limit to the AI controller. Make it so cars will only travel up to x amount of speed.+Traffic mode. Add traffic to the level. Ideas will flourish with AI normal cars.+Online Mode.+Police Pursuit scenario.*Pros:*Great physics for crashing cars*Easy to use menu*A metric♥♥♥♥♥♥load of variations for cars*Mod friendly*Has a built in map editor*Easy to jump between other cars*Edit bind keys for different control patterns*Has a ""Can your PC run this game"" in the menus, with 4 green check marks (for me at least) to see if your computer can handle it.*Fun game all-around#Constructive Critisism/Improvments:#Can't use mouse as camera to well. Either gets stuck in a rotation or will be under the car. (holding right click will use the mouse in free camera, but vcan only be reverted back to it's original position by pressing the reset camera key.)#Tires and certain curbs do not get along. Tires get stuck in curbs on some occasions. (depending on beamNG.drive maps vs mod maps and mods in general may affect it differently. results vary)#Cars sometimes fail to work when choosing a new car to replace. Meaning, no button controls will starts, move or affect the car. This can easily be fixed by re-chossing the same car until it works or it the ""debug"" icon in the menu (Esc) and it will work.#Reseting the car only faces it one way. You can reset the car to the starting postion by hitting R and reset the spawn location by hitting the Insert key. When doing so, the car will always face West (lets say West for an example) when respawning or changing spawn location. Makes it difficult for a set up if you want your car to start somewhere besides facing West. A good example is pulling into a driveway that the front of the car faces South and the Garage door faces North. If you respawn there the car will face West regardless. This is very easy to work around, by giving your vehicle the proper space to compensate for facing West.10/10 Rating for beamNG.drive.This game is a blast! The game has bugs, as any gamw would in an early access stage, but nontheless this game I would recommend to anyone looking into making awesome car chases with realistic and lifelike ending results, car crash reinactments, and can eavy be used by the real life police to simulate car crashes for educational videos or just for the hell of it."

I've only had this game since January, 2016, but I've still managed to put 192+ hours into it. This is just a really fun game, you can play the scenarios or roleplay in your mind if you want. I find myself occupied by just cruising around. While yes, it is easy to get bored of it within a couple of hours of gameplay, but you'll end up playing later on or the next day. BE AWARE: This game takes A LOT of computer power and top of the line hardware. I recently bought a $1300 computer and I still can't play this on high graphics. So just be aware of that. Right now the modding community is tiny, tiny, tiny. I can see a lot of potential modders come to this game, and I hope Steam realizes it and makes a workshop for it. Still on modding, its stupidly simple to install map mods, but I still haven't figured out how to install cars properly. :/. The game is super easy to debug and look at ""the beams"" of its namesake.All in all, in its current state, I give it 8.7/10Top 3 things you should be aware about before purchasing:-Extremely high specs needed-Not a typical racing game-Modding community puny"

Many of the maps have a verity of terrains to drive on.-vehicles, there is already a good range of I game vehicles and modifications which you can do to these vehicles. There is even wide range through the use of modes-destruction, there is a extreme amount of things you can damage and remove from your vehicles-replayability, no crash is ever the same . There is always some new way to destroy or drive vehicles-still in active development to new content is being added-slow motion,-world editorCons-- as it is still in development there is always going to be a few bugs- the game is not for every one, some people may like to just crash the odd car, the cost may not be justifiable for that price but enjoying other game features make the game worth it In my opinion-mods: I know I have said they are a benefit, but at some point how mods where installed changed so a lot of the old mods had to modified to work. The developers of the mods also appear to have to enable features to get them to work. For instance in older versions of the game you could just drive cars under water. But in the new game you can not. If you put a old mod in the game it can just drive under water without consequences. It would prober boy been better for the developers to enable all features by default then let the modders opt out of what features they don't wantOver all I completely recommend the game, I just love the physics of crashing cars.

My time with it was mostly spent just crashing cars while listening to podcasts.Devs have a weird idea of what 'realistic' driving physics are. Top tier race-tuned super cars with slicks spin out if you even attempt to turn, antilock brakes lock up, normal cars can't turn slightly at 30 MPH without spinning or roling over. I don't think these cars would pass ANY standards at all...other than that driving is quite detailed, offroading is really fun as each bit of the car is affected. Road racing is bad for the same reason, million dolllar ultracars break down like Lada's if you drive for more than 4 minutes without crashing.Highly moddable in every regard, tons of quality mods from cars to planes to tracks. Official mod respository with a drag-and-drop installation. Theyv'e nailed how modding should be...6/10, but 8/10 for innovation. It really needs work, especially with clipping and adding multiplayer, otherwise this is pretty much still just a tech demo."

Luckily the developers realize this and show major support to mods which helps this game a lot, and with mods you'll probably be more than pleased, but without mods the game is pretty empty. An example is that you can only really change the main color of your car, nothing else. Modders can do it in photoshop, but as someone who isn't trained with any software like that, I'm stuck with what the community makes for me. Keep in mind that was just one example, the body types, engines, etc. were all a lot more limited than what I had expected, but that might be on me. Anyway, it is a great game, just expect to go hunting a little for content."

The controls, while unclear, are very intelligent and work well. Most important to me is the great developer support this game has. There is even a tool built into the menu where you can screenshot issues and highlight them for the devs.TIP: The game comes with force feedback (vibrating controller) off in the settings as default. Go into controls and enable it. It makes a huge difference between being bearable to drive and floaty versus almost feeling like a real driving sim."

They still adding new maps, new amazing and detailed car and it just looks amazing... The graphicś gets few improvements from the first trailer of this game (4yr ago?) & TechDemo... It is very good sim game I play it on my wheel and cars are feeling very nice, but I think that force feedback should get few improvements coz it makes sometimes strange things so I had to turn it off.Also big adv it that game have lots great mods that can make this game more enjoyable!I am still waiting for a cool Carrer Mode or what ever it will be, but I can say that game have lots cool features like, AI Mode, so u can have lots of fun with crashing :D A lots of details like information about speed of each wheel, air speed, wind set up (set it to max XD Kappa) info about power, damages lots lots lots!

Stopping distance is infuriatingly long for even high-end vehicles, attempting to drift is next to hopeless, the shallowest turns and the slightest taps of the handbrake will send you spinning out and tumbling off the road and into the void.But MAN, if it isn't a beauty to look at. Vehicles warp, dent, rip, and break with startlingly realistic detail. There's no ""damage meter"" like in other driving games: you just go until you can't go any more.All in all, I can recommend BeamNG.drive if you can get it on sale; $25 is a bit steep for a racing game in which racing doesn't seem to be possible.

It's a great game for playing with physics, but not so great for actually driving the cars. Ovbiously, this is because of the fact that left and right keys can't determine how much you really want to turn the car, so you often find yourself swerving off of the road just trying to turn left, when you were driving about 9 mph. You can also use your mouse to turn the car, which sounds helpful at first, but is pretty much the same as the keys. I even tried to take it down a notch with the sensitivity on the mouse, but I still got the same result. Now, if you want this game for destroying the cars, buy it, because its worth the money on that part. The physics engine for this game is stunning, BeamNG very evidently put a lot of work into it. Watch the video on it's store page to see how great it is.Tl;dr: Buy it if you want to see cars get demolished, but don't if you want to go on a joy ride.(Also, if anyone knows if there is an easier way to drive the cars, please tell me, because I'm at a loss here. It was what I primarily wanted the game for.)"

But even with lowered settings its still very fun.  And IGN didn't lie, it really is an impressive physics engine.  You can watch pieces of your car very realistically fly off, launch your car from a cannon, drive it into a tree and watch the result.  It really is a very good car simulator, and with campaigns coming soon, no doubt it will make a great finished product.My only two complaints are that the sound isn't great (Though the game is Early Access, and with a physics engine like this, who really cares), and the camera angles are all a bit wonky and twitchy, there isn't one that you'd find in GTA or Need For Speed.Other than those two things this game is a blast.

The fact that it's not even done yet makes the already good quality even more remarkable. The developers could take some queues from Gary's Mod though. Firstly, enhance the time-wasting potential. Add in simple things to help people in wasting hours smashing random crap. I would personally prefer a keybinding that would allow for a car to be flipped rightside up and removed from the ground. This would reduce wasted time in the aformentioned smashing marathons. Another thing would be the addition of some form of attachable thruster so people could attain maximum vehicular carnage. Lastly would be MORE AND EASIER WEAPONS!!! The cannon is freaking amazing and has so much potential, but it has to be completely respawned after every firing and it's the only one of its kind. We should see harpoon guns, machine guns, barrel launchers, railguns, joke weapons like rubber chicken launchers and shark bazookas, the possibilities are endless!I guess the core of my reccomendation is allow for as much saving of time and energy during smashing."

I don't have a high end rig, just a core i3-4170 and a r7 370 4gb gpu, but I can still run this in most areas around 50-60fps. Start adding more than 4 cars, and that frame rate drops like a rock though. It's amazing fun even with that!Pros: Updates are fairly frequent, and almost always adding something. The visuals even on medium are amazing, and the scenery is gorgeous! The cars are varied, with multiple setups ready to select the moment you start the game. The simulation is far above the next best out there, with glitchiness happening only on the most extreme crashes. It even gets down to the internals getting damaged! While there isn't much in the way of missions, what is there is well thought out and great fun.Cons: Being early access this will change, but there is very little in the way of missions. The menus can be a bit overwhelming, and could be streamlined a bit more. Low end pcs will struggle to run this, if it even starts at all.Overall: A great game with amazing promise, a must have for anyone that enjoys simulations or cars!

The attention to detail is fantastic and destroying cars is never ending fun and with the Developers constantly updating the game you get new features often. The sandbox may get boring after a few hours but there's a solution, play the scenarios for a little break and then you can return to sandbox feeling refreshed. If that doesn't entertain you, the devs are adding a campaign soon.I'd rate this game a solid 9/10. It can be buggy and may get a little slow at some points but overall BeamNG.drive is a fantastic game that I would reccomend to anyone who likes cars even a little."

For an example of the kind of frustration you might have to put up with: a lot of times your car will slightly go over the edge of the road and you'll have to restart -- this is especially true for scenarios involving large vehicles like the cement mixer. (Might be tolerable for driving game experts, my mom gave up immediately.) More unfortunately, isn't really a ""racing"" game yet, since there's not much in the way of AI that (I could find), or two-player split-screen, which is a little disappointing. I also can't seem to get the (much-tauted on their website) one-click mod installs to work.In other words, it's much more of a physics playground with cars right now, but some of the scenarios offer fun challenges.So far, the best scenarios that I've found are the single player checkpoint race-against-the-clock ones. There are a few with crazy jumps and things, which are cool, but my favorite by far was one with a big classic truck hilariously falling apart within three minutes or so. You gotta reach the end before falling apart, but you gotta master the turns because the thing is crazy top-heavy and will flip with ease. My dad and I had a real blast playing this one. He was totally into it. Good time spent together. That right there makes it worth my purchase money.But again, it's early days. I'm sure most of this stuff will change and a lot will be added. It seems like the core physics in it are pretty great, but how the cars interact with the road often debilitates them TOO quickly. The menu system has a really snazzy material design aesthetic, which I believe is a newer addition. (The rest of the interface needs to catch up!)I took a chance on this because it seemed a lot different from the cookie cutter racing games out there, and it is. But they have a long way to go to remove a lot of frustration factors and add modes I really want, like local splitscreen races and actual AI.Got my fingers crossed for much more!"

This game has great physics for the car's damage, but with many vehicle options and great representation of handling/speed the game has gained a large following. For a game based on the soft-body physics of rigs of rods they did a darn good job at making this the game it was destin'd to be. Not to mention the ever growing community of modders making mods for the game that include vehicles, maps, scenarios, and tons more of what we can come up with. Every hour from countless ones i've spent on this game have been worth it. Though note you need a REALLY good PC if you want to run this game at a decent framerate with decent graphics.

Although different surface conditions are a bit lacking visually, there is a fair amount of tactile variation.The game looks good as well. Not amazing, but by my standards more than good enough.Plenty of content comes bundled into the game, and the modding community provides plenty more. The price tag is very fair.All that combined and you have one of the best driving games on the market.The one thing I'd like to see added is a mode wherein you manage a specific car. Something with crappy stock parts that you can upgrade and enter into events and that takes perminant damage. I'd be seriously hooked on that.Biggest thing that needs improvement in my opinion is the sound. It's a bit basic and in some areas (turbo) plain bad."

The realism in the crash's and sheer pleasure you get from simply ramming what ever the f*ck you feel like into random sh*t is immense.The added campaigns and the variety of modes that are slowly being added are great.. Although this game still feels like it needs more in the way of a purpose, It needs a story or alot more levels and scenarios to play with. Personally I would love to see alot more crawling and 4x4 realism. Although that is specific to my taste, on the whole and more realistically I feel there just needs to be more levels. When you see the ""download more"" In the levels/scenarios/campaigns it just feels like the devs are being lazy in adding their own content... which is a real shame as the ""download more"" just takes you to a forum with a list of Mods.There are a few issues I am finding though, The game feels poorly optamised. I run a GTX 970 and an FX 8350 with 16GB of RAM, so although my system is older, it is still no slouch. The frame rate simply will not comfortably sit at 60FPS no matter what settings I use, I have settled for a mid range setting that will sit around 50-60FPS with infrequant drops to 30 and 40.I also personally think the game engine may actually become outdated by the time the full game is released, this game came out in 2015 and we are still in the ""early access"" phase..  It is hardly ""early access"" now as it has been TWO years since release. By this point one should expect that the game be moving forward.I hate to sound negative in my reviews but I want people to understand my opinion from a realistic perspective.I highly reccommend this game to people that have a decent rig as they will get the best playable experience. I would expect anything lesser than a 9 series GTX card wouldnt give a decent playing experience. Or a playing experience with alot lesser graphical qualities.On the whole though this game is great for an hour or so to play around with but it definatly needs more! I am going to try some mods out today infact to see what is out there in the community for it."

The core of the game fuctions around it's physics engine, which is very well built, however for as much fun as crashing various vehicles into various walls and other vehicles is, the magic is short lived. There is a set of scenarios, mostly races, however the keyboard controls definitely aren't up for that being an easy or fun task. In order to get the full experience of this game you probably have to use a steering wheel and pedals controller set up, but I wasn't going to shell out for that on account of one game. In short the game is good, but probably not worth the asking price right now unless you either have a steering wheel and pedal controller set up already, or really like cars that accelerate in short bursts of the pedal to the floor, which is the effect the WASD controls deliver."

The audio isn't the best with repeated crashing sounds, and sometimes the cars get stuck together or in the walls, especially when re-spawning, but heh, it is early access.Definitely worth buying, especially if you just want a few hours smashing up a load of cars LOL"

BeamNG.drive is very fun with spectacular crashes and cool vehicles. The only thing bad about is the vehicles are hard to handle without a steering wheel."

The game has good graphics and the damage is very realistic. Its nice to see that developers also reply to people having issues with the game like i previously had ( unable to play at all due to crashing). The game is fully mod friendly and you can add custom cars / planes and even tanks allowing more destruction and fun to be had. The game is still in early stages and does have its flaws but with a team that is this involved with its customers these issues will soon be solved. Thanks again to the developers for helping me resolve the issues.

If you have ever played Next Car Game (Wreckfest) then you'd probebly expect this to be very similar, but in all honesty, this is unlike any other physics engine I've ever layed my eyes on. The physics in Next Car Game are hard, and almost given an arcade feel to them, but BeamNG focuses more on realism. Granted some cars can feel a bit slow and lethargic at times, but for me, I'm not exactly bothered by that. If you ever get bored with the game itself, I recommend downoading some extra content for the game (mods). It can sometimes add a whole new depth to the game. When you want to do more that crash into stuff, check out the challenge minigames and push some of the cars to the limit, and even if you fail, you can usually see your car smash into something, which is nice. All models are creativley designed, and each one drives differently. You can also drive and shoot a cannon, which I feel is worth mentioning. Do note, this game takes LOTS of computer power to run if you're looking to play on some pretty decent graphics, but all and all, this is the ultimate driving simulator. (Sorry Gran Turismo)Pros:-Fantastic Graphics-Addicting and fun crashes-Weather system (Change they time of day, or the weather at any time)-Realistic driving-Vehicle custimizations-Fan-made downloadable content (There is no Steam workshop. You have to download these mods off of the BeamNG website)-Interior View-Fun little minigame challengesCons:-Takes a lot of computer power to run.-NO multiplayer-Very derpy local multiplayer (Yes, there's local multiplayer, but it's in an experimental state at the moment)."

There are 3rd party mods to get more vehicles and maps and the community seems pretty steady - not crazy amounts of new content all the time, but worth checking for new mods maybe every 2-3 weeks.BeamNG has excellent controller support and I enjoy it most when I'm using a steering wheel / pedals & clutch / shifter combo.  You can swap parts out on your vehicles and sometimes the transmissions will support full H shifting, other times paddle shifters or just automatic.In terms of realism, the physics are certainly there with full crumpling of components and breaking of individual car parts, but I find the vehicles all lack a kind of grip-to-the-groundedness.  Sometimes I adjust the environmental gravity up a bit to make them stick and grip better.My last point would be that I like the amount of freedom that's been handed over to the user in this game.  You can pretty much do whatever you like."

,Recommended,284160,29389673,Posted: 20 January,all,Smoky the Campfire Slayer,"Good game, but lacks content and requires lots of mods to actually fulfill the happiness you thought the game would have been when you saw it on YoutubeFirst of all, BeamNG Drive is a great game, the detail the developers put in the physics, cars, and the fact that everything can fall off makes the game really fun. The problem is, that there is only about 39 minutes of fun playable content until you turn to the mindless downloads of mods. The career mode is a work in progress, but I do not have any high hopes for BeamNG to become a racing game, simply because all of the cars have soft suspension to exaggerate vehicle softness. The situations/ or incidents, or whatever you call them are also not very good, as the soft suspension makes the game only good for what you saw on YouTube-crushing them! If you do put your heart into the game, it can be really fun crushing all different sorts of cars, but for a person like me, I will probably open the game up for 30-40 minutes, and then forget about it. GET IT WHILE ITS ON SALE.While BeamNGs content does seems lacking, we never really wanted anything else. Great every once in a while, but it will never become the first on your to-play list."

(They seem to have fixed this to an extent but it still feels cumbersome). The collision dectection can act goofy if you run into things at high speeds mostly with trees. The car crashes feel and look nice but I wish there was a way to have your fuel leak and maybe your engine blow with an animation of an explosion. Also the bugs are light so don't let the early acess lable draw you away. This may be just me but I found Modding to be much more complicated than it needed to be. Overall this game reccomended by me.

The campaign consists of training and senseless destruction which is great fun, doing some weird and wacky destruction. The scenario mode puts you, into levels like a destruction derby that you can take on AI, a level where you must land insane jumps to perfection, or my favourite one, the car chases. Every scenario is packed with very different challenges which aren’t seen in many car games.BeamNG.drive also contains a free-roam mode in which you may select a map to drive in, to do what you want, when you want, perhaps go against AI or create insanely huge crashes which again was another part I enjoyed thoroughly. Driving in BeamNG.drive isn’t the easiest of tasks, it feels very real simulation like and if you make a small mistake, you’ll soon find yourself spinning out of control and causing a heap of damage to your car,but with a proper racing wheel, I can imagine the experience would be one of the greatest in any car game. The car physics shine in the damage department with it’s real time damage engine. The damage caused to the cars is exactly like car crashes in real life and I had hours of fun trying to smash cars up in completely twisted ways. That’s the kind of game BeamNG.drive is, do anything you want, create what you want. If the default content gets slightly old for you, BeamNG has provided a link to download mods in the car selection, the scenario and free roam menus so that you can add other user-created content or even create your own items to add to BeamNG.drive the community have even got full on air planes in the game! The graphics in BeamNG.drive looks very realistic, with the car damage next to life like! Drive your car at a lamp post it will wrap around it just as it would in real life, you can tell the developers poured their heart and soul into making this realistic experience,look great as well as feeling great. The environments are stunning, to say the least and they also really triumphed with the look and feel of the locations.Jungle rock is the one that impressed the most, small tarmac roads with tropical trees crowding the roadsides and with lighting that compliments the jungle so elegantly. BeamNG.Drive is a racing/damage simulator game I want to see make it big, no driving game offers an experience in which you can create any car scenario you’ve ever imagined.I hope to see it on consoles one day to outshine the likes of Gran Turismo and Forza and become a solid rival. It would also be great to see some kind of online multiplayer, that’s where the game is falling behind nothing better than having a crash with some friends.BeamNG.drive is currently in early access and it does take a fair bit of time to get used to the controls and the system, but once you have nailed everything it shapes up to be quite an exciting ride. BeamNG.Drive is a immersive driving game offering near-limitless possibilities, i would highly recommend purchasing. The game can be purchased on steam for £18.99."

I mean come on! You can look through all th unreccomened views yourself if you want to and you'll see. This is a truly amazing sandbox game. Theres even a custimizable AI! On top of that you can even custimize your own car! Theres also scenarios which you can do specific challanges if you dont want to go on your own. The people not reccomending this game are also annoyed that the game isn't finished because there's ONE NOTE: ONE! Part of the game that is unfinished which is the career branch of the game.

,Recommended,284160,31351364,Posted: 24 April,all,condottiere,"For a general-purpose car physics engine, this makes for some really fun and challenging rally racing. I'm in the far minority of reviews here, not recommending it for the crashes. I try not to crash in this, any more than I already crash in Dirt Rally. I really like the feel of the car handling, making allowances for a lack of specific focus on laser scanned tracks (Assetto Corsa) or rally-focused surface modeling. That said, I'll reiterate that this is still really fun and challenging rally racing, even for an engine not focused on it. Plus I love the idea of building a game/engine working from first principles and organically evolving real-world results and vehicle/environment interactions.Remember what the devs said -- they're focused on the mechanics. The graphics at first don't look polished. But there's a level of fidelity in car body deformation on major or minor dings that I dig -- it's not the same canned response for damaged bodywork when I prang an obstacle. The angle of impact and shape of the colliding object all naturally shape your car's response and deformation. I mean duh, of course, it's what they designed it for. And they're rightfully proud of how car bodies respond in going over rough ground. Pretty cool.Totally recommend, even without the crashes."

In all I would say 7/10, really fun for those who enjoy sandbox style destruction games however the driving needs a little work and there isn't much in the way of structured scenarios that I can PERSONALLY say I've enjoyed."

It's worlds will be explored within 10 hours easily and the fun factor of crashes doesn't last much longer than that eather (at least that's the case with me). But what never leaves is the feeling of exiting realism like i've never seen and felt it before. Seriously, the physics of every single part of the car feels absolutely astonishing every time you enter a corner and the satisfaction of completing a perfect drift has never been on this level before. Every part of your car feels like it's just the way it's supposed to be. Also the developers are quite good when it comes to content updetes as every updates brings only positive aspects with it and is worth another 5 hours playtime. As a lot of performance improvements were made since the beginning, the overall performance is quite ok, but don't expect it to run perfectly, it's still in early access. Modding is easy and works perfectly, which expands the content dramatically over time. Overall, this game is definitely one of my all time favourites in the car/racing genre. If you like cars, destruction and physics, this game is worth a try and definitly worth 30 bucks."

I really love the fact that the crashing in the game looked very realistic, and also, the cars on the game are based on actual brand-cars, and what I really love is that the game even allows you to add mods to it, so you can drive and crash real-life brand cars, and stages, etc! Even though I love it so much, i think that it has plenty of space for fixes. First of all, pretty much all the cars have the same engine sound, which is pretty weird, and also, the front glass of the cars don't break more. They just act like plastic. Also, there should also be some floating parts of the cars when they crash, such as screws, bolts, etc, because this happens in real-life crashes, too. Also, can you perhaps add some splash effects to the water when an object falls to the water? That will be really appreciated. I have more improvements to think of, but still, the game itself looked really well-made. I would recommend it to anyone that loves driving simulator games or racing games or something like that."

(Because manufacturers dont want their cars to look unsafe, false advertising). Its fun just to crash cars for no reason other than for pure destruction. And just the level of detail is incredible, the customisation, realistic driving, damage that actually has a meaning other than just dents, upgrades that do more than move a bar further, tuning, plenty of cars to wreck, detailed maps, and like i said before, the damage engine. Some things that can  happen: hydrolocking, brake fade, overheating, deflating tires, body damage with parts that come off, engine failures from overreving, rollover followed by engine oil starvation and blue smoke, windsheild will crack and/or shatter, enigne fires, fuel tank ruptures, oil pans being smashed, and a whole lot of other things.

,Recommended,284160,31952859,Posted: 25 May,all,Rablax Fan Wazooski,"This game is too amazing to explain. From a little CryEngine3D mod, to this, its got the BEST soft-body physics. It's obvious that it's meant to be played with a controller, but you can set up your own key bindings. People say it gets boring after the first crash, but that is not true, at least for the people who buy the game for the crashes. It's a crashing simulator, what did you expect? BeamNG even rivals some professional crash simulators, which is insane! I hope this game gets better and better as time goes on. However, one little thing is that having more than three cars is laggy. I get that it has to load all the meshes for the vehicles, but it seems like it could be more optimized. I'll stop wasting time now.(Edit) I have done more research, and i now understand how BeamNG's physics engine works (kinda). It uses a series of nodes and beams, hence the name BEAMng.drive, and these nodes hold the thousands of beams together. Every second, the physics engine is calculating how the beams should break, bend, and deform 2000 times. This is what makes the Beamng engine work. Theree's things like resistance for stronger or softer car bodys, and different horsepower and such, as well as accurately simulated suspension. The reason the graphics are not top of the line, is due to the fact that beamg is made in Torque3D, which is an opensource game engine, that can handle lots of custom physics engines. It happened to be the only one that could handle the beam engine. It has graphical limits, which is understandable, and the reason Beamng is so cpu and gpu intensive is due to the fact that the physics engine is working very hard. There may be ways to optimize it, but for now, Beamng is going to have the same graphics, and the same performance."

Even with light throttle you still slide like your driving on ice.. The caster and camber funtions do not affect cars as the do in real life. it seems to be exaggerated to a factor of 10 even with mild adjustment...Some road surfaces are worse then then others about the ice feeling..(maybe thats just me)The goodIts runs pretty decently. Frame rates for me are great. Throttle control and braking are realistic. Gear ratios are accurate and making changes does affect engine performance and rpm based performace this is something alot of games get wrong (ie a l4 gas engine not going to pull like crazy at 2000rpm like a V8 Gas engine would likewise power fades above 4500 in a v8 while power is strong and growing in the L4) things like that are a nice touch (tho the diesels seem to have gas engine characteristics). The Manual gear box options are great with rev matching done automaticly for you. (even tho the sounds are blubbley when this happens maybe the sound is based on rpm?) Adding force induction (Turbos\Superchagers) Makes moddest power gains not these wild gains in other games. Also being able to adjust waste gate timing is nice. It even seems to affect performace but we all know you just love that blow off. I do admit some engine sounds sound amazing! the F1 ish wine of some the trubo l4s is great and the roar of the american V8 is lovely (however idle sounds are way to quite. no lie i would love to have a large cam idle for some of the american v8s) I know these are only of the IN GAME cars stock out of the box i have yet to try other mods as of yet. There are LOTS of options (be it broken ) in tuning the car. (yet some don't seem to make any discernible changes) The Interiors are nice and the gauges work well (tho haveing the manual shift lever move would be nice) Crash physics are a bit jiggly and cartoonish so its not so jaring when you smack a tree doing 90mph. (tho.. the engine seems to be runing just fine with this happens....)Things I would likeFix the sound please...and the Garage! (maybe its just me..) Window tint... idk just would be nice.. More maps out of the box! A heads up GPS. (idk once again have not played with any mods these are all stock play) A open world sever would be cool with other players (like a GTA ish map set up but that might be asking way to much)Final ThoughtsIts fun. Worth a play. Worth what they are asking for it. Its early access so yes...its a buggy mess at times. BUT it does work well. Plays decently and...yes..with pactice you to can be driving your AE86 sidways down a mountian listening to Running in the 90's (and crash into a rock because you suck at life)Enjoy you time behind the wheel fellow petrol headsFaye <3

(so thats not a con really, but i had to point that out)-The frequency of the updates, I personally would like to see minor patches every week, right now its a big ~3 gb patch every couple of months, so dont expect to see new content frequently, but if there is an update, ohh you have a LOT to check out.

In the 200+ hours of play time I've had, I haven't found a major bug yet.The base game has a wide range of vehicles and maps to play on. The vehicle selection is varied so you can get a feel for any vehicle type. From a small hatchback, to a sports coupe, to a truck. Every vehicle drives differently and handles differently.Not to mention, the new update completely re-doing all the SFX. Every engine has its own sound and all sound incredible. It varies from the deep snarl of the Barstow V8 to the high scream of the ETK V10.The modding community is also massive with any vehicle you may want. Personal favourites include the ETK S series by NinetyNine!, the Satsuma 210 '58 by mike94 and 2017 SBR4 Facelift also by NinetyNine!.I'm not entirely sure why the game is in early access as there isn't any bugs or glitches I'd expect from a game in early access. It may be because they are constantly adding and changing things to make it better.I first played this game when it was in a very, very early alpha, back when the UI was little white boxes with drop down lists, and it has certainly changed since then.Absolutely worth buying."

It is amazing what games on PC can do, if you  have the system to suport it. I have 30+ years on console and finally decided to jump to high end gaming on PC. Got my 4k monitor i7-7700k, 1080sc and I'm ready to explore the world of pc gaming. WOW! I'll tell you what, going from playing games on console where the cars and the world look good but the crashes were really lacking, I seen my boys watching videos of BeamNG and I had just gotten my rig. I loaded up steam, bought it, downlaoded it, installed it, started it and O...M...G! The first time I watched a car fall off the mountain i was dumb founded how georgous it was. Going from gaming in 1080p to 4k is amazing in and of itself, and BeamNG in 4k, really almost looks like I'm watching You Tube videos of cars crashing.I am limited by my ignorance of the beast I have at my fingertips. I am 6 months new to PC gaming and I'm so overwhelmed by all this cool stuff I have ideas for but don't know how to actually execute it. I some hoe got lucky enough to fumble my way into 28 mods actually getting onto my game but I screwed some of them up and there are like yellow protest signs saying no Texture, like a constant reminder from the game saying ""haha console infidel you have no idea what your doing"" lol. So i know I have alot to learn. I still have 80+ hours in it even though I don't know how to do all the cool stuff and mods I see people doing. Once they release online multiplayer, fingers and toes crossed, I'll need an I.V. cause you'll never get me off this. I highly recommend this game just for the crashing aspect alone, unlike anything you've ever seen, unless you've seen it in real life already, it's that close. I could defintiely use some help learning how to get and use mods and stuff like that. After screwing up what I tried to do, I'll wait till I learn before I try and do more."

There is always something to bring me back to this game and it’s mainly mods. It's a fun crash simulator and a means to find out how physics really work at different speeds. Gave me a new concept I'm not invincible at 200 mph...Thanks dev's for saving my life!PCMR

It has softbody pysics so when your crash the car gets deystroyed most of my games I only have 2 hours on record but on this game I have 73 hours on record (I have no life) This game is really fun and if you have the money I recommend getting it!!!
76561198276155326,Recommended,284160,35073968,Posted: 19 September,all,ttower,"This is a really fun game to play. You will need CPU power for many vehicles, but I can spawn three or four before it gets really bed, and I have an AMD FX4300. The crashes are pretty much the whole point of this game, and they are done well. There are fun scenarios and freeroam. I guess there is also a campaign in the works? There are plenty of mods (no workshop) and they can add most anything to this game. There are also placeable objects to have fun with. I definatly recommend this game, even if you dont know how much you will like it. Get it, and if you dont like it, return it. If you go past the return limit wiithout realising, it means you have found a game you like. Price may seem steep, but the game is good, especially if you can get it on sale sometime."

,Recommended,284160,35077134,Posted: 19 September,all,lil Jawzey,"I have two words for all of you interested in this game: Stress relief. This game and it's massive mod library allow for an extremely extensive amount of fun to be had. New maps, cars, engine tunes... The mod making community for this game is absolutely massive, making the activities endless. Crashing car into walls or driving them off cliffs makes for amazing stress relief when you're having bad day or just need to release some pent up anger.This game is also a good time passer if you're looking for a game to play in your free time and want something open world that you don't have to commit to. The devs are constantly updating the game and the quality is always getting better making this a very active project. The devs obviously take pride in what they have and they definitely should. You should definitely consider this game as an addition to your library if you're interested! :)"

A game that has multiple scenarios for you to complete and a number of mapps that you can drive in free roam and do what you wish and drive where you want both on and off road, along the way you can generate a number of different objects to crash into and the physics of the game are good especially when crashing into object and you see the damage to the car with flying doors and wheels. There are plenty of add ons with additional maps and objects to download. Bear in mind it is early access but well worth the purchase!"

I absolutely love this game! The development team is active on the Beamng forums and keeps us up to date with the progress of the game and what direction they are heading. There is always huge improvements to the game every update and new content added as well.The physics simulation and sheer amount of customisation is amazing, i have played over 180 hours and will continue to play many many more smashing and thrashing my way through the countryside. The modding community is active and the amount of mods for this game is astounding, Cars, Trailers, Maps, Planes, Boats and all sorts of wacky stuff.This is one of the very very few early access games i haven't got buyers remorse from and would recommend 100%If you plan on buying beamng i would recommend playing with a gamepad or a steering wheel to get the best out of the game but it is optional.Beamng also fully supports 21:9 Ultrawide monitors natively,"

Well, this game is basically what it says, a open world driving sim with full body physics, your very own crash sim. But it can go even further with mods, and futher updates (which even though they might not occur very frequently, they add more and more content to an already great game). This game is flexible in it's own kind of way. The community is almost always active, and so are the devs. I cant wait to see what else come for this game, and how many more ways can I mutilate a car."

,Recommended,284160,35427619,Posted: 2 October,all,y.sin,"Probably the most realistic car simulator out there!Most people buy this for the crashes but the car handling is probably the game's biggest selling point in my opinion. Although it can be a bit challenging at the beginning, you'll get used to the car's behaviours quickly and it's actually really fun zipping across the racetrack or the desert roads in whatever car you currently have at your disposal."

However, if you're looking for a game that has substance, plot, acheivements, progression, or anything like that, look elsewhere.  This game has super realistic physics.  The crashes are great.  However, the novelty wears off pretty quickly when you realize there's nothing to really do other than mess around.  Unless hours and hours of messing around is what you're looking for, of course.  I get the urge to play every few months, and while I enjoy it, I quickly remember why I don't play all the time."
