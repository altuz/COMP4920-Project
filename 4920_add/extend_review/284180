76561198051962534,Recommended,284180,11049060,"Posted: 3 July, 2014",all,Kouji,"I'd first like to say that I don't play metroidvanias, but this game stuck out like a sore thumb to me, in a good way of course. Ever since I saw the trailers on greenlight a few months back, I knew this game would be awesome because of how different it looked from other metroidvanias I have encountered. Once MAL came out, I instantly bought it and boy did it deliver.The game is a breath of fresh air, from the story line to the VERY SMOOTH controls. The game reccommends you play with a controller, but the keyboard works perfectly fine just because how accurate the movement is. Everytime I died was only because I was being too reckless.MAL's storyline is cliche, but it is very well executed. I've always had a saying that cliche isn't bad, as long as it's well done and solid. The dialogue is well placed and the timing is perfect. It definitely made me laugh the whole way through. Also, I really liked how thee's a chance to see funny interaction between the three heroes when you go into camp.The combat is solid, very easy to pick up and difficult to master. There's no super heavy ultra super sayian combos, but it gets the job done, especially if you play Vienna :D. Boss fights are very challenging and not some monster with a lot of K.O. moves. Enemies are fairly tough, you can't just run and there and expect to wreck everything. Recovery items are almost nonexistant, but that's a good thing because I don't like games holding my hand. Besides, you can always go back to camp to heal if you really needed to.Level design in this game is great, as expected of a metroidvania. The secrets are moderately spread out and not too hard to find. All the maps seem to flow together seemlessly. I do often times get lost, but that's half the fun. I also really liked howthis game utilizes ALL THREE heroes, instead of just making one do all the work. The maps require you to use all the characters in order to find all the secrets and access different areas. However, one very minor grip I have is that aside from regular secrets, I wish there were like super hidden secrets. I know you guys are trying to make it completeionist friendly, but a few super secret loot wouldn't hurt :3 (unless there's super secret loot and I just havent found it yet. I'm on to you developers!! Just kidding).The music in this game is great. It's not the best, but it definitely fits with the atmostphere of the game. Very mellow and ambiant. You don't really notice it being there, but without it the stages wouldn't be the same. But, if you do decide to stop and listen, it's well made and pretty darn catchy.Art style and animation in this game is subjective in all honestly, but it is, however, very solid and gets the job done. That's all that matters. Long as it doesnt look like I'm playing a game at 2 FPS when the actual FPS is 60 or Vienna looks like a burly man XD.I highly reccommend this game. 10/10"
,Recommended,284180,15418202,"Posted: 17 April, 2015",all,White,"Metroidvania with a really good balance between combat and platforming. There's a little bit of backtracking here and there but mostly for items and not actually progressing the main quest. The story, characters and script are original but the dialogue (especially among your party characters) can be hit or miss at times. The music score is good. It reminds me of the music in Super Metroid, mostly serving as background environment music, so you'll either notice it or you won't. (Except for the warp rooms. You'll always notice the music there.)There's little reason to play this game a second time though, unless you're hunting for achievements. And if you're hunting for achievements, keep in mind there is an achievement that requires you to beat the game within a time limit of 2 hours."

A metroidvania with a first playthrough time from 3-6 hours, a strict focus on melee, and exploration based leveling. However, if that's what you want, I have yet to find a better game in indie circles that MaL.The good:Distinct characters, amusing dialogue, well signposted plotMultiple playstyles, each with a different focus (ballanced, offence, platforming)Solid platforming, solid level design, solid boss designThe bad:The platforming focused character is essentially useless in combatCombat is overall unnuanced, and fairly easy, will leave you bored and just running passed enemiesMusic gets repetative and annoying quicklyThe missable:Every item and 'potential' item states in the item description the item's location.Every powerup is accounted for on the world map, but you have to be in the area.Vienna's final powerup make the final boss an absolute cakewalk."

This is a product of two design choices which, taken individually, are not bad.-No contact damage from walking into enemies.-Enemies are slow to react to players.This means it is quite easy to simply run through most rooms without engaging anything."
76561198003469036,Recommended,284180,33545083,Posted: 14 July,all,Dread Guacamole,"An extremely solid indie game in a genre I love, Magicians & Looters is a pretty easy game to recommend. At its core it's a platformer with (small-ish) sprawling, fully backtrackable levels (all the better to go hunt for any missing treasure) and lots of combat and exploration. The levels start out pretty linear but they start spread out as you unlock traversal abilities like wall-running, rolling and tall jumps (but weirdly enough, no double-jumping or dashes).I... guess that's a long-winded way of saying that yes, this is a metroidvania game.You play as one of three apprentices of varying skill with weapons and magic, which you can switch between in special rooms. They each have customizable equipment slots and unlockeable abilities - I actually needed to plan their builds for different bosses in my playthrough, and that's something I don't remember from other Metroidvania games, at least to this extent.Most of the combat is weapon-based. Magic is important, but unless you equip some very specific items the energy regeneration is so slow as to keep it supplementary. The game handles very well (except for Brent's Wall Jump) and doesn't overstay its welcome at a breezy five hours or so (for me, at least and  that's exploring every nook and cranny for secrets.)Finally there's a surprising amount of dialogue-based story to go through. The tone is unrelentingly goofy and even if the jokes don't always land, it remains likeable."

The game isn't too long, took me about 6-7 hours at an easy pace. The controls are very tight for the most part, and the gameplay is solid throughout. Some of the later boss fights can be a bit frustrating, but with some practice you'll eventually beat them.Overall, well worth the money for a relatively short and solid experience."

The combat system is very simple and easy to learn, as is the inventory system. The movement is really responsive and the animations are great. There is also a decent amount of difficulty that can be overcome through proper planning and skill.What makes the game great is the humor along with the music. Both are outstanding. Be sure to read everything, and then replay the game using abridged dialogue for even more entertainment."
,Recommended,284180,18550370,"Posted: 18 October, 2015",all,Crimson Fire Fox,"Awesome game, tons of fun. Although it is a bit short of a game, you can beat the game twice in about 6 hours. (Mind you I accidently left the game on one night so I kind of have twice that logged). It's even a great game to be competitive with for speed running since you can get through it in less than half an hour. Where the game lacks is the characters; You'll manly be playing as Vienna due to her speed and high jump ability making it easier to get places and Nyn for her destructive swordplay. Brent could have been better if the magic system was a little more forgiving on mana regen.TLDR Section~Pros:- Good animation- Awesome art style- Fun... Lots of fun.- Each character feels unique and their playstyles are actually disguishable- Well written story with a hilarious abridged version available.- The music is epic.Cons:- Short. As you can tell by reading the other comments, people have only put in 3-6 hours and 100% the game.- Character swap mechanic is underutilized.- Dance of the Gnomes aka The Toll-A-Warp music."

The mindless banter of fruits and sibling rivalry!Magicians & Looters is a deliciously crafted Metroidvania that is true to itself. It's full of soul and full of detail. Your attacks feel like they matter, and there are quite a few of them for each of the three characters you can play.You can decide who to play as, but ultimately, as you explore for the opening to the next area you'll be forced to take the character with the ability required to progress. You're made to experience each character's abilities and move set, and made to adapt. Morgopolis have made the transition seamless.The items and weapons you can collect throughout the game serve to test your play style, making you synergize and re-experiment for every boss. The leveling system is based on exploration, but doesn't punish you should you withhold its progress. The abilities provided through leveling up are quite nice, and unique to each character, which helps to make item synergies for each character based not only on their default stat values (such as attack speed or aerial strikes), but on whether they've got extra resources to a certain pool.Magicians & Looters really got me. It's witty, charming, difficult, and tasty as ♥♥♥♥. Any Metroidvania fans out there would be missing out if they passed this game by."

The story is funny to most everyone but it is even funnier if you have play a goodor badgame of D&D.You have three characters to chose from but given the type of game this is I was stuck playing the monkish acrobat as she has the best movement out of the three. You don't gain exp but do level up throughout the game with orbs you find across the map. These affect all three of the characters so no worries about the times you are forced to use the one you don't like.I played the game with a controller but not a Xbox controller. I did have to change the commands though. But you CAN change the commands, which is something some devs overlook.This game is a fun ride but very short for a Meroidvania style game.Bottom line is that if you want a light-hearted Meroidvania romp through a game world that you will never see again, give this game the time of day it needs to show you its best and worse.If you would like a game-play-through I did one on my channel here--->Playlist"

There's nothing really exceptional about it, except for how mediocre it really is.  The combat is functional, but not much more.  Exploration exists, but it never really feels worth it.  Most of the upgrades don't seem to do much, and all three characters are mostly identical.  For some reason, the developers decided to split exploration abilities between them, so you will need to switch occasionally, but this is mostly just annoying.  There's also humor, in that typical ""comedy RPG"" style, that is making snide references at the way videogames work and poorly thought-out stories you might see in an NES title.  Really, there's nothing here that hasn't been done better a thousand times 10 years ago."

It is a light Metroidvania where you switch between three playable characters at save points in order to access other areas of the game.

Thankfully the trailer on here was helpful in establishing whether I wanted to buy or not.The plot is a little silly for me, but the gameplay is great and has a real metroidvania feel.

How cool is that?There are plenty of secrets in the areas you explore and cool items to collect to kick some butt.The bosses are challenging, but not impossible which is a huge plus.

The pacing is ever so slightly slower than I'd like, but the rest of the gameplay makes up for it.I'm using a Logitech F310 controller which the game initially had some problems with. I had to rebind my controller buttons, the defaults were terrible. It should be X attack, A jump, B defend (and a few others), it gave me A attack, B jump, X defend. Y was my inventory/menu button instead of start. Note that ""Xbox controller"" is not the same as this controller in the options."
