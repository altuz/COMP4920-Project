TL; DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!Maize is a first person adventure game about sentient corn, and the scientists who developed them.The game starts off with you being dragged around by corn, and then waking up in the corn field without any idea of what just happened. I was very curious about this sentient corn, and how it came to be. As you venture into the research facility, the story focuses more on the scientist’s overly dramatic relationship with each, rather than the how or why of the whole situation, so expect to read a lot of dialog on post-it notes from these two. By the end, I find myself left wanting more details about the sentient corn, and I think they could have done more with the story.The gameplay is mostly what you would expect from a first person adventure game, but with a lot more of a walking simulator feel to it. You’ll need to walk around, explore, and find objects to complete tasks to unlock other areas and progress. There’s not much difficulty in completing these objectives since you can see the shape of the objects that you need to find, and the objects also have hints on them about what their use might be.After a little progression, you get a sidekick named Vladdy. He’s a sentient teddy bear that you’ll need to do some tasks for you. In contrast to Vladdy, the different corn characters were amusing, and entertaining at times, so I liked them, and would have liked to have seen more of them.Pros:interesting concept, and the corn characters are amusing, and will likely lead so some smiles at the sheer ridiculousness of it allthere are quite a few collectibles to find, and some of the flavour text is amusinggraphics look good for the most part, and there are more environments than you'd expected; some of them seemed out of place, but it fits the whole nonsensical theme of the gamemusic is fine throughout the gamevoice acting is good for all of the characterssound effects are mostly good, (except for the mechanical sound when Vladdy walks, which is a bit irritating)Cons:short game with lacking in substance, and they could have done so much more with the story (it took me about 3-3.5 hours to finish, and that was with me finding and reading almost all of the collectibles)obnoxious light bloom and flickering the lights all over the walls in a couple areas is hard on the eyes (more settings to adjust graphical effects would be nice - at least most areas were okay)your sidekick Vladdy is extremely annoying, and he constantly insults you, and everything around you with the same lame phrases, like ‘stupid,’ ‘idiot,’ and ‘trash’ over and over again... (I know it’s intended that he’s got such a negative personality, and I just wanted him to shut up, and go away)(nitpick) keybindings are not customizable, and there is only partial controller support(nitpick) had a fatal error and crashed right before the end (no progress was lost)Performance wise, I was usually able to maintain 60 fps on epic settings with some occasional drops (GTX 1070).Conclusion:Maize has a ridiculously fun and silly concept, and it’s definitely a game that doesn’t take itself seriously. The sheer goofiness of it all made me smile at times, but the constant overuse of the same insults gets very, very annoying. I also found the game to be lacking in content for the price, and I would have liked more depth to the story. Overall, it was an alright experience; it’s not great game, but it’s not a bad one either.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also view this review on my websitehere."
,Not Recommended,284240,31189278,Posted: 16 April,all,LimEJET,"The most important things about this game:It's a Hidden Object game, not a puzzle game.It's about two hours long.It's a comedy (which means the quality of the writing is even more subjective than usual).If you are averse to any of those things, there's no reason for you to buy it. If you're not sure, I'll go into a bit more detail.Hidden ObjectThe game would have been labeled a walking simulator, if not for the players' spooky ability topick things up and put them down in other locations. May sound like the beginnings of an inventory puzzle game, but no. There's no ""trying everything with everything"" here, it's all clearly marked. The hardest part is finding things. There is one real puzzle, which is a maze. Not the titular one, another one.Basically, the entire game consists of three steps:Find glowing thing.Find glowing spot to use thing.Repeat.That is Hidden Object to a tee. And if you're okay with that, that's fine. It's just not communicated at all before you buy. For me, that's not okay.LengthThis is not an issue for me, but I know it might be for some people.If I hadn't backtracked looking for collectibles (which wasn't needed by the way, they're all in plain sight), I'd have clocked in at under two hours. Make of that what you will.WritingHumour, by its very nature, is subjective. Personally, the writing fell flat after about 40 minutes. If you get that far, and don't like it, it's not going to improve.One thing everyone can agree on is that jokes get less funny when repeated many times. This is Maize's biggest issue.The sidekick keeps calling the player character and the world in general stupid the entire game. This goes from endearing to annoying as the lines are all basically the same, and use a very limited vocabulary.The sentient corn is portrayed as being confused and lazy. That's all they do. Every time you meet them, they say something confusing and vaguely funny, and then talk about having a nap. It gets old fast.The two head researchers are even simpler stereotypes, where one is stupid and in charge and the other is smart and annoyed. It's all very predictable.Actually, that's the worst part of the writing:its predictability. You know from the get-go that the game is about sentient corn, because that's in the tagline. The first thing you encounter in the game is a huge steel door that seems to lead to some kind of underground facility, so now you know there's an underground facility. It keeps going like this.The plot, mostly as told by the things you pick up in the environment, not so much foreshadows upcoming events as spoil them in detail. There's one thing that isn't spoiled, and after it happens,the game responds with ""so what?"", marking just how insignificant it was.SummaryIt's a mediocre experience.If you like casual Hidden Object games and enjoy a bit of simple humour, and don't mind the price tag (I got it on sale, and for less than a movie ticket I'd say it was fair, if not necessarily ""worth it""), I'd say go for it.As I said, the humour is hit-and-miss. If you feel like giving it a try, and you're not enjoying yourself by the point you meet Vladdy, you're not going to enjoy the rest. For me, it was tolerable, but by the end I was really annoyed."
,Recommended,284240,28227259,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,Spasman,"I played this outside of Steam, and bought it since I liked it so much.I thought Maize was going to be another UE4 example edit turned walking sim, but I guess I was wrong about that. The game has a lot of love put into it, and actually has enough stimulating puzzle gameplay to keep itself out of the walking sim genre.The animations and music are really charming, and I really enjoyed the voice acting too. I don't know if the developers are amateur or a full studio but I could be convinced it were the latter. I love the environments a lot (especially that 80s looking IT lab) and the passive aggressive sticky notes (that remind me of work emails) were a nice little way to tell a side story and develop two characters.I think my favorite thing about the game is it is fairly funny, but the best part of that is I can't remember a single instance of an internet meme or a pop culture reference. Most of the humor was original, and that is becoming very lost in games that make comedy a focus nowadays, because they're either trying really hard to appeal to Lets Players or children, almost alienating people who actually want to play the game instead of watch it on youtube. This game's sense of humor establishes itself in its own way and firmly grips to being original all the way through. 100% I'd much rather hear an original bad joke then listen to some character blather about me getting epicly rekt or coyly mention pepe the frog or their favorite twitch emote is Kappa or some other dumb shit.The little bear sidekick was cute, but he got really taxing after a while when his dialogue got repetitive and predictable. I know I'm a ""stupid idiot"" but there are only so many combinations to make out of those two words in the existing English language. He sort of grew on me in a ""hes an annoying character, but hes my annoying character"" way, though I think they could've made him a bit more likable.And while I do say it had gameplay, the ""take object and apply to another object"" concept got flat after a while. Thankfully the game is short so it doesn't get too tedious, however short games may turn people away. Some of the object interactions were clever/funny though, like using a stupid broken shovel handle to tip over a cabinet that you could of just done yourself. That could probably get lost on some players (THATS DUMB WHY NOT JUST TIP IT MYSELF) but I imagine thats the joke.The game is also fairly unoptimized. Ran like crap on my 1080 (id say ~40-50fps the whole time). I'm no UE developer, but I think the trick to that engine is to put a lot of focus on the optimization and let the engine do the rest of the work. I also had a Fatal Error crash during the ending of the game but I'm sure thats been fixed or reported by now.Overall, the initial price may seem steep if you've heard the game is short, but the price is invested in other areas such as writing, animation and audiowork. A game doesn't need to be 10+ hours long to be good. Hope to see more wacky imaginative games from these guys in the future."

WHYIt's only around 3 hours, too short for a 20€ game.The prerendered cutscenes have terrible quality.Doesn't expand enough on the existing potential. (ties into the game being short)Some of the ""running gags"" weren't funny to me, i.e. ""Pressing Q does nothing"".Overall I think the developers deserve to make enough of a profit to finance a longer game and unleash their full potential."

Maize promises a ridiculous, silly first-person puzzle adventure and goes so far beyond any expectations it completely blows you away. It's not gameplay-packed and it's incredibly linear, so anyone who isn't a fan of more narrative-based games should stay away, as its story, characters, and dialogue are where it excels. That said, the gameplay never feels tedious, and there are few, if any, real headscratching moments.There are some faults, mostly programming-wise. There are times where I got stuck on level geometry and had to reset, and the outside areas - where individual stalks of corn are rendered blowing in the air - seem abnormally intensive, though my computer isn't built specifically for gaming, so that might be a problem on my end.Either way, the issues were not nearly enough to keep me from enjoying this game to the fullest, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for 4-5 hours of a hilarious, compelling, and overall brilliant game."

Imagine it as a short story and you are looking for the big twist that is coming.You won't get a kick out of this game if you want challenging puzzles, if you need complex story or in depth characgters.I would say it is overpriced for the length as it does not have any replay value.

,Not Recommended,284240,28187317,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Teao,"The adventure ""game"" is pretty weak if you're really into point/click adventure games. It is very linear and the puzzle solutions are pretty much spelled out for you and areas not currently involved in current puzzle are even blocked off. However the adventure game is more than adequate to be the skeleton for a good humor game.The story is mediocre. I was expected the ""twist"" from very early on. But again it is more than adequate to be the meat for a good humor game.The problem is there is very little humor. What humor there is funny at first but the writer phoned it in and mostly copy/pasted 3 or 4 jokes throught out. And I love callbacks but these weren't callbacks or even attempts at callbacks. It's just the same few jokes repeated over and over like 7 year old who learned a new riddle about a toilet. I can't even in good conscience give an example because to spoil even one joke would reduce the value of this game even more.If you're bored, want something funny (and sadly comedy games are slim pickings), and the price drops to $5 then get this. But at the current price it's not worth it.Note: I don't know how long the game really took me but it was significantly less than steam logged. I idled a lot doing other things. I do that with a lot of games."
,Recommended,284240,28337663,"Posted: 12 December, 2016",all,Snoopa,"Maize is a first person puzzle/comedy-adventure. I would say it's like an Escape the Room game but with a lot of walking, picking up items, placing items down, opening doors, move on to next area.The story is a mystery. You awake on a farm and find talking corn. You make your way through the labyrinth of cornfield and science lab to uncover the secret of why you are there and the corn that is walking and talking.It's hard to describe this game but one word comes to mind as I played through.......""Stupid."" But the word isn't necessarily a bad thing. Stupid is what the devs were going for and they made it work.-The conversations between the corn were stupid but the jokes were pretty clever.-A teddy bear with a robot-backpack-arm spends the whole game calling you and everything stupid.-Walking into countless lobbies with the same stupid golden statue.-Picking up collectible items with stupid info on it.-Reading the stupid arguments of the so many posted notes between the two who ran the lab.But with all that stupidity in there, it was pretty clever to see everything put together.Some of the things I didn't like:-It felt kind of dragged on. The puzzles weren't that hard to solve as long as you check every room thoroughly to get all the items. My issue is walking back and forth through the huge field or hallway of the labs. There wasn't too much distinction of halls that broke away from the main hall so tended to walk through the same rooms to look for the room I needed.-The Notes between the two scientist. They were everywhere! It was all nonsense. Mildy entertaining to read but I felt I wasted so much time in my life reading some of them. It was all the same. One of the scientist was spending money on ridiculous things while the other called him an idiot.-Walking Bear. The sound of his robotic walking grew very annoying. Think the old Robocop movies but faster. Never stopped. As I've said above about the amount of walking I did, the sound did the same amount.My likes: (Not Much)-Entertaining story. Enough to keep me wanting to know what all the secret is.-Puzzles were Meh. Pretty linear and self explanatory but creative nonetheless.-The teddy bear. Though the sound of him walking was annoying, his constant insults kept a smile on my face.-The time. I've read people have completed it in 3-4 hours. I was really getting bored of the game and was happy it ended when it did. Just the right amount of time.Overall:It's not a bad game but it's not good either. I recommend this only because I believe the devs deserve recognition for creating a wreck/masterpiece. It really was an interesting game from start to finish. Would I play it again? No.6/10 Rating from me."

Because you are a silent protagonist, much of the backstory is told through post-it notes, the quest items themselves, the set pieces, and even the item-hunt collectibles placed randomly throughout the game.  As it is with stories about sentient corn, the plot can get a bit silly and outrageous at times, but it never gets stupid, and the developers did a really good job of tying everything together.My only complaint is the needlessly complicated corn maze that connected all the areas was very annoying to navigate at times, but otherwise this game was an A+ experience."

,Not Recommended,284240,34618884,Posted: 30 August,all,CitizenX3639,"Thanks to the developer and publisher of Maize, Finish Line Games, for creating a unique world for me to escape and explore.Maize is one of the strangest games I have played in a while and I’m still on the fence on the overall experience. I think a lot of players will come to the same conclusion totally based on if they come in blind or have watched previews/ reviews. It gives a strong first impression but that opening feels misplaced from the mood and tone of the overall game and sets up mixed results in the end.The story of Maize begins with you appearing in a cornfield of a farm that is actually being used as cover for a hidden government facility. You then make your way through the corn maze to your first puzzle and a note from your host. It’s very basic, linear gameplay of find items, place here to open door to proceed and that doesn’t change for the entire 5-6 hour play through. I found this totally disappointing as the puzzle component is very much hidden object level of difficulty. The objects you can interact with are all highlighted in the world and everything comes with a quirky written description such as picking up a rock that’s useless but you take it anyway and you give it a name.As you proceed you will complete a mission to build a Russian talking Teddy bear companion, Vladdy,  who is the most miserable, negative character ever. Every sentence Vladdy speaks includes “stupid” or “idiot” and it gets annoying after a while. Also when walking, due to his mechanical frame, this machine sound is constantly in your ear. Vladdy is small so he is always moving and on a lot of occasions gets hung up on the environment. Vladdy isn’t bad but that’s all he is, a companion who complains and is used to go through air shafts or hack terminals. In some instances there are moments Vladdy is funny but it doesn’t outweigh the burdens he brings.  There of course are some other characters you will interact with and all of which are animated and voiced excellent.Graphically Maize looks amazing from the outdoor lighting cutting though the tops of corn stalks to the excellant characters animations. There is a lot attention to little details whether it’s the names on cans in a cupboard to the rust on a wheel barrow the environmental artist and animators deserve high praise. However, the game runs like a potato (30-45 fps, 1080P max settings,Ultrawide) and it doesn’t help the graphic options are very limited. The worst part is no matter what option I turned down, it didn’t seem to change the frame rate. The game could have defiantly used some additional graphically options and maybe some more time for optimization.It would not surprise me that the developers are Tim Burton fans because Maize, like Burton movies, is just weird. A majority of Burton films, in my experience, can be memorable for their writing, characters and story but not always positive for the enitre viewing. I want to like Maize but its simplistic gameplay, so-so story, annoying writing and terrible optimization makes it a disappointing experience and not the next Nightmare befor Christmas but {gulp} it feels like another Johnny Depp/ Tim Burton movie collaboration since 2005.PositivesUnique story ideaExcellent lighting, environments and animationsSome charactersAttention to detailVoice and music are really goodPerfect length for this type of gameNegativesThe opening level feels out of place(grim and dark)Basic, easy gameplay and difficultyStory and writingLimited graphic options"

,Recommended,284240,33056774,Posted: 30 June,all,Bacchatus,"This game has been on my radar for some time now, but I never got around to actually playing it until recently. It's short, clocking in at under eight hours. Except for a rhythm mini-game at the end, it's entirely a first-person point and click adventure game. While the game does not struggle to explain or justify itself, the developers know (intend and acknowledge) that things are played a little fast and loose at times. But in a game with sentient corn and an animated Russian teddy bear, this hardly detracts from the experience. The graphics are of high quality and the voice acting is excellent.The game is clever, but not overly so. Some of the jokes make invoke a smirk or a smile, but I wouldn't say you're likely to approach anything close to laughter. (Maybe I'm just too surly for this kind of game.)I do have some nitpicks, however:- There is a significant amount of backtracking, so be prepared to see a lot of the same scenery.- All of the puzzles are fairly easy, with the exception of that sneaky tape bit.- I would have liked Vladdy to have a more diverse vocabulary. You can only hear ""This stupid thing is so stupid"" so many times before it ceases to be amusing.- For a game about sentient corn, there is surprisingly little sentient corn. The majority of the gameplay consists of you running around silently with the occasional crack from Vladdy. The corn makes brief appearances, except at the end, to push the plot forward at times when the plot really doesn't need any pushing.I was also a little disappointed in the ending, though you really couldn't have expected it to end any other way.Overall, I'd recommend this game as a fun little distraction for a couple of hours. It's a very well-polished little adventure, but set your expectations accordingly. This is not, nor was it intended to be, a game with high replay value or something that's going to really stick with you."

76561198077342511,Not Recommended,284240,33973785,Posted: 2 August,all,Acerbiskyb,"When I first stumbled across this game and watched the trailers I was honestly really interested in it and thought it looked promising or at least like an intresting concept for a game. However after playing through this game all of the initial interest and ""promising"" aspects are completley gone. The only redeeming quality this game has is its soundtrack, but that is nowhere near enough to redeem it. My main complaint with this game is the writing, its some of the worst dialogue in a game i've ever heard, the constant repetition of the same phrases, by your main companion (The Russian Teddy Bear) is enough to drive you insane. The words ""Stupid"" and ""Idiot"" in a terrible Russian accent over the course of 3+ hours is just flat out annoying and reflects lazy writing. Vladdy (the name of the Russian Teddy Bear) is hands down given the award for worst video game companion, Vladdy makes Preston Garvy from Fallout 4 look like an angel. Dialogue aside the core gameplay mechanics are also an issue, the puzzles dont challenge you and the game in a nut shell is a walking simulator where you pick up any and every highlighted item you come across. Theres no achievements in this game so even the smallest sense of accomplishment is missing from this game. The fact that they charge $20 for this game blows my mind, if you're determined to buy this game still to make your own oppinion about it at least wait untill it goes on sale, I only purchased it for $10 but even that was too much for this game. If i had to score it from 1-10 i'd give it a 3-4 / 10, DO NOT waste your money."

But as a game for the consumer - I can't recommend it. Maize has no notion of pacing, gameplay, or variety of any description, on top of being poor value for money. The 4.4 hours it took me to finish it, a third was spent reading post-it notes of which there are hundreds, and another third running around hunting objects. At optimal efficiency you can easily finish it in a couple of hours, which, for 20€, is a hard sell.Entire game is spent hunting down items in diabolically restricted levels, in ordert to stick those items in their designated slots to progress further. The only sligtly different interaction I had to do was a dancing minigame at the end, that's it. Needless to say you get sick of it pretty fast. It feels like a point and click adventure from a first person perspective.Normally those games, such as Sam and Max series, or my facourite - Runaway series, have a fantastic story and writing to compensate for your having to slog through the dumb object hunting. This game doesn't.The story exposition for this game essentially consists of the same 4 jokes being repeated over and over again. I will list them here, so you can understand how true that statement is:- ""Stop pressing Q""- ""We are corn and we are stupid, let's go take a nap.""- ""Everything is stupid, you (the player) are an idiot, and I am a grumpy Russian bear!"" (and if I say this enough times, it will be funny, yes?)- ""You collected another random item so we can write how dumb you are for collecting it. Haha.""That's it. While it was funny the first couple of times I heard/read it, it, as any dumb joke, quickly grew old. All the dialogue, written or narrated, is trying to be humours via repeating over and over the exact same jokes and lines. It's getting old very fast, and naturally doesn't make those jokes any better because they are being repeated over and over. I can give you a hint: repeating the same thing over and over doesn't make it better, like this game repeating the same lines over and over. Because it constantly repeats the same jokes and flows the dialogue in exactly the same way all the time, which quickly grows old, because repeating something so many times is pointless and only builds frustration. And Maize repeats. Over and...You get the idea.Also, as a personal complaint - it was very frustrating for me, as a Russian, to hear the nonesense that this bear was occasionally spewing. There are 180 millions of us. And more who speak our language. If you are gonna put so much emphasis on the leading character being Russian, you can at least make the effort to get someone who knows the language to record the lines. Even CoD does it better - they speak with horrible accents, but at least what they say has actual meaning, and makes sense within the context. I am not normally sensitive to this, but this game was so ploughing in-the-face with the whole ""HEY LOOK AT ME I AM RUSSIAN AND GRUMPY"" idea, that it really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off sometimes.I think the studio has potential, but this game, sadly, does not."

The beginning part was, I feel, the best. I enjoyed the atmosphere, which was quietly unnerving and I was unsure of what to expect. Not scary, but just gives a very uneasy feeling. Again, this could have been because I had no clue what I was buying, and I seemed to have missed that ""comedy"" tag.Once the first ""level"" is complete, the groove of the game really sets in. The absolute highlight of this game is the humor, particularly the ""written"" humor. Everything you pick up, I encourage you to read the description of. There's a fair amount of items to collect and each of these has something funny written about it as well.The only downside I would say is the follower you gain about a quarter of the way through the game. I found him incredibly annoying and he makes a noise everywhere he goes. He's also designed to teleport near you if you run too far away from him, so there's no real way of avoiding him.Beyond that, I still say the game is enjoyable and pretty memorable. There's a quirky charm to it that's hard to find in other games. It's questionable if it's worth the $20 - it only took 3 hours to complete, and there were a couple instances where I was clueless on what aspect I was missing to progress forward, which ate into that time some."

I paid $10.It's times like this I wish there was a middle-ground between Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down. This is an odd little game.It's mostly an exploration-driven walking sim with basic ""find the object"" puzzles. It's also heavy on finding collectibles, and I guess the overall thrust here is ""comedic."" The humor is not my style, kind of Discworld-y puns and Adult Swim-esque randomness. Didn't appeal to me, but your mileage may vary. I hated the bear character. A Russian accent and saying ""stupid idiot"" a thousand times is not a good substitute for actual wit and jokes.The story is silliness, which is odd, because at times there's a dark, almost horror vibe to it. Then somebody or something talks, or you read the flavor text or a post-it note, and any menace goes right out the window.I give it bonus points for having a Pontiac Fiero. Niiiiice.Overall though, there's too much back-tracking (to pad out the paltry 3 hours?) and the humor too sophomoric for me to advise someone else that they should play it, and the full price ($20) is frankly ridiculous.For $5, I'd say give it a whirl, and maybe the style of humor will appeal to you where it lost me.

Admittedly some of them were alright, until you dealt with them for the twentieth time.- The game sells itself on the corn people, but they very rarely show up. They're sort of a wasted opportunity since they're supposed to be the main focus of the game. Most of the game is spent with Vlad.- Speaking of Vlad: he's the only interesting character, but that's not a high bar. He's only interesting because he is so abrassive compared to the rest of the characters. He exists for no reason, he just sort of shows up randomly and it's never explained why, which bothers me a lot.Overall, I refunded this game. It was not as entertaining as I was lead to believe.

I found myself sprinting, trying to get away from him and his amazingly annoying squeaking feet.The game is not difficult, it's very much ""oh hey here's a highlighted item, I'll grab it and wait until I need an item"" with little care for why this item would be here, or how it can help. About half the items you pick up will tell you directly in their description how to use them.The game's framerate jumped up and down fairly often, sometimes dipping into the low 20's which surprised me since I have a nice card with 8GB DDR5 RAM and a beefy PC outside that.The game had a couple nice moments, like the ending, but for the most part I felt like I was just trying to get my money's worth of entertainment out of it. Would not recommend."

It was quite lighthearted, endearing, and doesn't take itself seriously.  Though that sounds boring on paper, with as dark, gritty and realistic as games have been trying to be lately it comes as quite the welcome belief.  So long as you go in knowing that(which you should, the trailer very much markets the fact it's bizarre and off-the-wall) you're in for a treat.  But if you're looking for a game that treats /sentient corn/ seriously, you're out of luck(and probably will be for all of time).I can't continue without delving in the realm of spoilers.  At the end of the day this is linear story game as well, so I have to tell you now to buy the game and play it yourself before reading this, if it sounds like this game is for you.SPOILERS AHEADPROS:* Tongue-in-Cheek Humor - When this game chooses to poke fun at video game design choices I almost always get a laugh.* Lighthearted - The game doesn't treat itself too seriously at all.  It's definately a comedy game more than 'adventure' or puzzle'.  Honestly this thing was quite welcome in a world where RPGs have been super dark, and adventure games have been avant-garde.* Charming Characters - All the characters in the game feel quite relatable, even the villian, I was always happy to see a new cutscene.CONS:* Overuse of Some Comedy - The most common insult thrown around by all the chracters at all the others is ""stupid"" ""idiot"" and ""dolt"".  The bear does it, the regular corn does it, the villian does it, even the notes between the two scientists do it.  It was funny at first but towards the end I was starting to realize it was all the characters had to say to each other.* Poor Use of Vladdy - Because of my pacing, I didn't put together Vladdy till nearing on halfway through the game(I took the game too seriously at first, looking at every tiny little detail for a hint of what was going on, then sped up after realizing the game didn't have anything to hide).  Vladdy ends up not doing anything that you couldn't do yourself.  They make it as if he can only fit down vents, but the first vent you encounter in the game, you have to go down into by yourself /right after/ getting Vladdy.  Apart from that, he kicks things to make them work.  Other than that, he just calls things stupid(see first CON).  It was disappointing he couldn't contribute more.* Holds Your Hand too Much - This one feel free to take with a grain of salt, as I've said this game isn't trying to take itself seriously.  But the game tells you so clearly what you need to do, calling it an ""adventure"" or ""puzzle"" game is something I'd use very loosely.  There's signs telling you where thing are, items you pick up either hint at strongly, or just tell you what to do.  I never got stuck on a tricky problem, the only time I got stuck was I missed a small item on a very cluttered desk so wandered around for a while trying to find it.Overall though I think the pros outweigh the cons.  I definately recommend playing the game for yourself.  If you'd rather watch a playthrough, I Let's Played my whole experiencehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXz4bcltLiQ- but again, if this is a game you want to try yourself, don't watch, because it's a linear game there won't be anything unspoiled if you do."

I enjoyed all these aspects of the game ... a lot!BUT, I reached the end of the game after less than 5 hours, exploring everything. Most of the time you're searching for items that are hinted at by an outline in the world, i.e. the game mostly tells you what to look for to proceed. And that's the entire game mechanic of Maize. Nothing else, no puzzle solving.Now, for 19,99 € that's just not enough! Even if the production value may justify that price because you're basically visiting lots of areas with lots of items to pick up, the 'puzzling' content is just too little.

Second thing was Vladdy's voiceover - I'd prefer if it was voiced and written by someone who speaks Russian. The things he says in Russian could still make no sense but they could be jokes of their own.I absolutely loved the ending."

It's a charming puzzle game that doesn't make you get frustrated by puzzles that aren't too obscure. A lot of time you will play puzzle games that have you clicking every item in your inventory on objects until you get the right combination to progress. Whilst the items you have make little sense, it all makes sense within the context of the puzzle.Meanwhile this rather stupid (but the good type of stupid) story plays out. I have nothing but respect for the developers. So much love and care was put into the building of this world and I cannot wait to play more of their games. I can recommend this game at ANY price point!Enjoy! :D"

Dialogue doesn't advance the plot, but rather repeats roughly three stock jokes over and over again (corn are easily distracted, Bob is bad with money, Vladdy thinks everything is stupid) without ever expanding on them or adding anything new. A better plot could have supported the simplistic gameplay - instead, the experience was dragged down by both.While I really wanted to love the premise and characters, this game would have been better if it was either about an hour shorter, or the plot and concept were expanded on more, with more variety in the jokes, more information about the facility and making exploring and engaging with the setting actually feel rewarding.As it is, I wouldn't recommend this game."
