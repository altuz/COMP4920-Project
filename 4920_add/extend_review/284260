I don't believe I've ever had some many friends ""wish list"" a game I've reviewed or suggested.)I’ve just begun experiencing PANORAMICAL, and I’m damn near speechless.It’s not a game, there’s nothing to win, no one to defeat, no points to score (as far as I can tell.) Only a world of your own making, or at least “fine tuning”, to explore in literally endless variety and scope. The intro and first two scenarios begin to display the possibilities, and so far that’s where I am. I wanted to report this “discovery” as quickly as possible, for all my friends (and others that understand such worlds of imagination.) The “player” (“conductor”, more like it) can use keyboard and mouse, game controller, or MIDI device to control nine aspects of the image on the screen. Color, texture, detail, weight, proportion…I don’t even know what each is, but it's pretty easy to see the specific results of each key. Each aspect is controlled by one of nine keys, and selecting a position on an XY graph. The Store Page indicates that there are actually eighteen controls, so I can’t conceive of the complexity, or uniqueness possible (though that may refer to nine keys times two dimensions.) The screenshots are recorded by the TAB rather than F12, a non-issue, but important to know.And the music of PANORAMICAL…even at this early stage it’s so suitable to the wonder and magic of the images. (And it doesn’t cost extra!) Apparently there are fifteen very different landscapes, all within your control (you, and the music.) This is one of the only of over 600 games that I want on both my PCs. I want this running while I play other games (offline), and while I watch movies, and while I read and while I sleep. I want this to be the background to my life. And all this after seeing the trailers, and less than ten minutes of the actual program.My friends, and the Community Hub, will be seeing many of my screenshots, so each of you can be your own judge. And as I learn more, I’ll report more in this review. It would not surprise me if this becomes one of the highest rated “games” on Steam (as long as players understand what they are purchasing.) They can only be surprised that it’s more than was ever expected.Thank you.(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)"

As a fun diversion to enjoy some eye-melting visual effects, it's maybe a little expensive. If you got a discount coupon for it (like I did) or see it for cheap during a sale, and just want to enjoy a trip for the eyes, go for it. Just know there's not really much interaction other than messing with 9 sliders which affect each of the 14-15 environments, (that's as many as I discovered, I don't believe there's more unless you unlock stuff through some obscure method) you can't walk or look around, so you're set only with what's in front of you. There's also an ""Inverted"" mode which just flips the colors of all the levels. Still, like I said, made some sick desktop wallpapers with it! I'll give it a thumbs up."

,Recommended,284260,18090378,"Posted: 18 September, 2015",all,GameDragonZero,"SUMMARY: A musical/visual game where you manipulate various settings to create your own visual/musical combinations.  Worth purchasing if you enjoy experiential games, and like unusual musical and video experiences.Panoramical is best summed up as an audio/visual toy.  It's a kind of spiritual lovechild of screensavers, Proteus, and  the Atari C-240.As you play (with minimal instruction) you enter various settings.  In those you have nine factors you can maniuplate - there's no directions, you have to find what they do.  Each factor alters both the musical and the visual landscape - what could be a mysterious black and white swamp, with a few tweaks, becomes a strange mirrored plain with shooting stars flying about.  Music could be dissonant, orchestral, whimsical, or something else.Each world presents different factors, effects, and sounds - and it's up to you to figure them out.  You can make amazing things with this game if you take the time.One thing I came up with early on when playing was to simply mix a world then leave it on in the background.  Just let the music and world I made fill the room while I worked.Pretty much you can tell right now if you'd like this game.  If you like things that are unusual and experimental, especially in the audio/visual vein, then you're probably already buying it.  If you're looking for something strange and fun to play with, you may consider it.  If you're looking for a traditional game with some funky graphics and music, it's probably not your bag.I will note that the same above applies for gifts.  If it's not for you but you've got that friend who loves her weird electronica or he loves playing with graphics, you just found a great present.Pass on it or spend hours jamming out to imaginary music worlds, your choice.  But it is a nice job of programming and obviously made with a love of music."

,Recommended,284260,29381210,Posted: 20 January,all,Hattori,"How do you even describe this ""videogame""?In Panoramical, you are given a  template, in which you can move at will the parameters that change that template, creating sounds and objects in the screen  as you do so. Thats pretty much it. Thats the extent of the actual interactivity you have in this game. You procedurally generate sound and visuals.What is really incredible, is how much that small interactivity can create both visually and audibly. Every button in your gamepad adds something to the screen, each with hundreds of possible variations and intensities, and every change creates a new sound that adds up with everything else creating specific and melodic tune.These parameters while very abstract, manage to resemble objects and forms from our own world, and you will soon start to see landscapes and worlds that seem to recall our own planet, but feel completely alien to you at the same time, creating one of the weirdest and coolest experiences I have ever had with procedurally generated games.The tune created alongside the visuals also seems to perfectly match with what you are seeing, creating beautiful tone pieces and abstract moving paintings.You can see how hard it is to describe this game by now.But trust me, its so easy to lose yourself to these worlds you create, and just when you think you have extended fully the limits of a specific canvas, you find something new in a specific parameter that creates a whole new handful of possibilites. you really have to force yourself to stop, just so you can move on to another template, its very easy to lose half an hour in just one place.The experience is just very surreal and immersive, partly due to the constant movements of the figures and shapes on the screen, the camera always seems to move towards the horizon, giving you the feeling of soaring over the mountains and plants you create.It also has 3 specific templates that focus much more on the music side of the experience, and you can actually create some very cool music tracks that seem to have some sort of structure, those are worth checking out as well.Anyways, I tried my best to review this game, but I feel like I did a very bad job at it. I guess you just have to play it to understand what im talking about, but its a very short and sweet ride through the uncanny valley, and if you are the kind of person that takes part in ""special substances"" and zone out for a few hours, then this is for you."

I'd been interested because of David Kanaga's earlier “Proteus”, which I'd returned to many times to wander around in and relax. I'd been looking for the same but more, and I didn't find it here. After a bit under an hour, I've whizzed through all of the scenes here, at least up to unlocking inverted mode, and I can't see myself coming back. There's a bit of beauty here, but also a bit of chaos and ugliness. All the same, I feel bad for not liking Panoramical. Others might find more in it."

Although I had some trouble getting the MIDI controls working (it seems to have major issues if you have more than one MIDI controller hooked up), once I got everything synced up to my Arturia Spark I really started having a lot of fun with this game.This game is very inspirational to me as a musician and indie game developer.  It is giving me a lot of ideas for my next game.Music and art style is a bit of an acquired taste.  I like it, but it may not be everyone's thing.  I recommend using a MIDI controller with a lot of knobs on it, and taking subtle approaches to the experience, because that is the way to go with this game."

If the developers had incorperated different musican's etc, Flume, to add to the soundboard, it could have gotten some awesome results. A bit unpolished, but a very unique game.

You can manipulate them and change them into something else. The sounds seem to move along with the changes or is it the visuals that move along with the sounds? It doesn't matter. Behind me, my boyfriend tells me later, the cats were breaking down the house, but I was completely oblivious and sucked into my screen. Yes I was on a trip. A journey.allthought I write a lot of reviews for websites and newspapers, this is actually the first time I decided to write something on Steam. I feel like I have to, there are people who don't get this game and I'm not saying that my vision is THE way to interpret it. But it got to me in a way where I just have to share my experience of this game.  Or is it even a game? It acts as a crossover between a game and sound-editing program with trippy visuals. But really I see it as participatory art.It completely rips up the whole concept of 'game' and what we expect of it, and that to me is what makes it even more fascinating. It starts right out with the intro and menu being so incredibly organic, instead of the typical list of buttons you can click, it's a dial that looks almost like a living organism. It's incredibly easy to start 'playing', the controls are very intuitive. I think a game like this encourages natural play a lot more than some other bigger games out there, where you have to follow certain paths in very constrictive ways.The music goes from angelic to stomping to racing and back again, it's mellow and then it's intense. You can adapt it like you are the creator of this little musical universe that keeps on moving and hypnotizing you. It is like you can SEE the music, a concept called synthesia, where the different areas of the brain that control our senses get connected or mixed up. Normally only people with a rare condition, or people on psychedelics get to experience this. And now we can sit behind our screens, completely sober and touch on that magical experience. Allthough I must admit being high makes it even more immersive - if you can handle, try it! Pretty sure that makers had a few trips that inspired them to make this.I must admit thought, if you're sensitive to bright lights and flashy visuals, be careful cause it's VERY intense. I'm glad I'm on preventative medication for migraines, else I would probably, or rather definitely have had an attack from this game. Having said that, I can't really discover anything else that I didn't like about this game.Of course it's a matter of taste if you like it and since it's so different, I'm pretty sure it will be a niche group that will be drawn to this game. But I guess it's the same with art, not everyone likes it in the first place and then there's all the different types of art. If you go to a museum you might pay ten euros for the entrance and look at still lives of similar visuals. Now you get to participate, make music, manipulate visuals and even make sceenshots of your trip. I think it's well worth the money and I would love to see more of the makers.Also I think that it works different than a regular game where you level up and go through the story and then you finish after 50 hours. This is an experience, and I feel I would like to go back to that experience every once in a while, but not hours at a time.After playing this I feel stimulated, refreshed and inspired. Something like a meditation."

These people are cowards.Thinking about Panoramical (or any game, really) in terms of ""content"" is a mistake; it's like arguing that an album is terrible because it's the same dozen songs over and over, or arguing that your local playground sucks because there's only 3 slides instead of 6 slides. The point is that YOU and YOUR DAMN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE are the ""content""? HEY MAYBE THAT'S WHAT ART IS???Instead, here's how I recommend thinking about Panoramical: it's an album, it's a place to hangout in, it's one of the best local co-op experiences in years. Play this while intoxicated, while sad, while happy, while alone, while with friends, while unemployed, while angry. Panoramical will listen to you and respond better than any other game.(disclaimer: I know the developers but I bought my own copy)"

Not even a hip-hop beat nor any instrument of any kind. Your run of the mill remix contains more variation that these ""different"" areas. Also, the graphics are SO 1980s. I got that from the promo video, but I didn't expect it to be that bad on my computer.Love supporting indie games, but this one is not ready. It's simply not fun."

Awesome chill-out visualizer. As the visuals morph and change, so does the soundtrack. A glorified screensaver it is NOT!  Jeff Minter's 'Psychodelia' on the C64 (1984) was for me the grandpa of light synths. Panoramical takes things to a whole new incredible level. A thing of beauty. A digital 'van gogh'. Highly recommended!"

Overall, the music hangs in a kind of adjustable steady flow which creates a calm, meditating sense of play but it can get a bit repetitive and too much in the ambient genre. Personally, I prefer the  stages that include a certain sense of advancement in them. the first and last stages portray this nicely and especially the selection of guest stages fare best in this matter.I hope the developers will find a way to bring some more content to the game or ideally create an editor for users to create more stages themselves. That would make the possibilities endless.Still it's a worthy and refreshing experience hard to be disliked!"

A drug induced haze, minus the drugs. Play in small doses as it is entirely possible to overload every sense you have. If you have photo sensitivity issues, tread carefully. There is an option to adjust a setting or two as well as an applicable warning in the begining. Go play it anyway."

However, sitting down one evening using my headphones and much-larger-than-my-monitor television I found myself really enjoying every scene. I do sort of wish that the music/sound could be decoupled from the visuals in a few cases where I really liked the audio, but tweaking it to that state resulted in things like color schemes I didn't love. But! It's still lovely, even when the designers made choices I don't entirely agree with.And, let's be honest, this is exactly the sort of experience that most people will find pairs very well with recreational brain chemistry modification."

,Recommended,284260,20316214,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,Sensual Lettuce,"I wouldn't consider this a game, but more of an audio visual experience. The experience is comprised of around 12 different stages, each of which have their own visual theme and music track. The way you play the game is by triggering disparate parts of the visual scene and audio track, melding them into a unique combination of all the elements. In writing it is slightly difficult to convey how the game works, but it is easy to grasp in practice and the effect is enchanting.This is not really a game that anyone needs, but it is a wonderful experience to have, especially if you have a good audio/visual setup in your gaming environment. I played this on a 120"" projected display with DTS sound and it blew my mind.Interestingly, Panoramical can be played with a MIDI controller (used for music production) as well as a gamepad or keyboard and mouse."

I mean, it IS abstract. Who knows what all that stuff is.The guests were great too. The disco-like triangle place with a strange pulsating red thing and a upbeat soundtrack, the floating city on the water with purple rings to dive through, the realistic-looking scrolling city...so beautiful.I'm yet to play inverted mode, and I've only played each scene once, but the time I've spent on this game so far were worth it.If you think a game needs a way to win, a way to die, and a way to score points, then don't get PANORAMICAL. But, like me, if you don't think a game needs that stuff, then get this game. Or is it a game? I'm not sure...But whatever. If your definition of a game is a picture you control, preferably a pretty one, then you'll love PANORAMICAL.It's perfect."

,Recommended,284260,27405171,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,ARAMIS,"PANORAMICAL is less of a game and more of a showcase of what can be done with the symbiosis of audio and visual interaction. Multiple ""stages"" let you adjust and play around with a variety of parameters which will, in turn, change the sound and visuals of whatever landscape you happen to be looking at. One of the more impressive stages takes place in a constantly scrolling brutalist glitch city, which I found could stand on it's own as I played other music over top of the game. Some of the visuals are good for that kind of visualizer stuff.Another thing that has to be mentioned is the soundtrack by David Kanaga (as well as a few other artists in the bonus stages). If you were into the music from Proteus or Dyad you will love this soundtrack. Warped melodies and abstract electronica. Plus the Gershwin cover at the end is amazing. Well worth checking out just to listen.You'll like this if you're looking for more of an experimental tool rather than a conventional capital G game"

Sometimes I think it would be nice to be able to control the music separately from the visuals, but it also makes sense thematically to have them integrated.There needs to be more games like this."
