,Not Recommended,284290,9491050,"Posted: 15 March, 2014",all,maplesyrupghost,"This game is a scam, IMHO.Edit 2015/11/20 : well moreso a scam when it would barely run on my old computer (Radeon HD 7970 -- still a very very powerful card) but on my entirely new computer, a year later, the game runs better.  Still not much more than 30 fps, and on a Radeon R9 290 it can run Witcher 3 at a higher framerate.  Either way, original review below:I saw the screenshots, figured it looked amusing, so I figured I might as well try it out.  I saw salinger06 had left a positive review, seemed like a relatively safe guess that it would be a good game.  Before even playing the game, I noticed that salinger06 had no other games on their account, so it was likely that the developers had set up a fake account to leave a review.  Who signs up to steam to buy just THIS game?  I noticed that user only has 1 friend, Avreus Culter.  I look at his account, and it's full of these ""simulator"" games from PlayWay, I find that suspicious since they have generally recieved horrible reviews.  Now today, Avreus has left a positive review on this game as well!  Hmm!  I click on his review, and there is one comment from seph.au stating ""Yet another dev or family of dev self review. "" Furthering my suspicion.Now, that aside, maybe the game is indeed fun, so just now I go and try it out.  My system specs:  AMD Phenom II quad core processor, Radeon 7970, 8GB DDR3.  I can play any game on the highest options, I usually hold back on antialiasing (I don't go above 4x on the latest games) but generally any game I can max it out and play it smooth as silk.  I boot up the game, max settings.  It loads and is extremely slow, like 5 frames per second.  I remember seeing people complain about ""Mining Simulator"" being rediculously poorly written and causing people to run it on lowest settings, so that's what I did, get out of the game and try everything on medium.  Same exact performance.  Hmm.  Okay, just for fun, I tried every option on the LOWEST settings...  It was marginally better, maybe 10 FPS, still completely unplayable.  But just to see what the game was like, I tried to struggle through a race.  The game engine is really bad.  There was little to no effort put into this game.  How a person could log more than an hour into it boggles my mind.I wouldn't wish this game upon my worst enemies and I think the entire PlayWay catalog should be removed from Steam and those customers refunded if they wish.  This is a scam.Edit: Apparently someone has said that this game will run on nVidia GeForce graphics cards.  So if you have a Radeon, don't even consider it, if that's the case.  I literally can't play the game to log more time to give it an honest chance."

There were also numerious spelling errors, which I can forgive since it is not an English developer.Despite all that, I started a career and entered my first race, and, simply put, I was not expecting the level of sheer incompetence in the driving. On my game controller, the left analog stick controlled throttle, brake AND steering, which was odd, so I chose to use a keyboard.My rig can run GTAV at 1080p 60fps, and it was struggling with this game, which was alarming as it looked like a game from 2006. The game controlled HORRIBLY, and the AI seems to be arguably braindead. There was a point where a rival mounted my trailer somehow, with the lackluster physics engine enabling it to.There are no engine noises, instead the pure lack of anything is filled with a really bad 'country' soundtrack, which I had definitely heard somewhere before.A game shouldn't be tedious to play, but halfway through the first race I just wanted it to stop, and that's not what you want from a game in the slightest. The most entertainment this game provided me was uninstalling it.1/10 - Don't buy it."

Yes absolutely.Look, if you enjoy playing poorly made games for a few hours to give yourself/stream/YouTube/friends a laugh you should pick it up.If, however, you are looking for a game using a simulator engine (I use the term loosely) that turns things on its head, mixes up your preconceptions and knocks it out fo the park, look somewhere else.Oh also there are Shark Tractors...

76561198064388679,Recommended,284290,24519500,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,ZenZone1,"All those talk about less than 20 fps are outright lies. Here's proof:https://youtu.be/LBX7N3XSwl8I dunno what they get off by propogating such vicious lies. My potato laptop specs are:i7-2630QM 8Gb DDR3 1333 MHzIntel HD3000 / AMD HD 6770m with 1GB DDR5This was recorded at 720p and also running at 720p. The lowest resolution this game supports is 800x600, 720p is 2 steps higher. Only shadows is on, all other settings are at lowest level. I get about 23-25 fps and this is 'coz the recorder is running, if not i could get about 35 fps or more.This is just a preliminary review, more details will be posted after i've done some actual playtime.Update 2016-07-26 0235It could be described ascasualracing game as it's not regular high speed races. They are farm tractors! how fast do people expect these things to go? There are some elements of authentic details in the truck models so it's not entirely casual or cartoony. Of course it's not high profile mega races sponsored by big coporations for other big coporations. The setting is based on small time farmers whose need for speed culminate in occasional racing events for the small communities. That's my take on it and i think it's a fair assessment. So if anybody come into this game expecting flashy high speed races, i can only smh.It takes place in rural locations unspoilt by high density industrial zones or busy city centres; old rustic retro kind of feel to it which i think is charming.GraphicsFrame rate is passable; not as optimized as say, Codemasters' GRID or DIRT of F1 series but it's still enjoyable as the tractors are slow moving so 30 fps should be adequate. Incidentally i got more than 30 fps at some moments but that is only possible when the recorder isn't running 'coz the first race was recorded at 720p. On my potato chips, that's pretty demanding conditions already. Maybe i can get above 30 fps with the recorder running at 800x600.The game has plenty of options to tweak graphic details but that is only available in the launcher. However no AA nor filtering nor V-Sync options in either launcher or in-game, those have to be set in the driver app. Neither can you opt for Full-Screen or Windowed mode, it defaults to FS. On my 22"" monitor, wide range of resolutions are supported from 800x600 - 1920x1080.In short graphic quality is beautiful so i dun understand what's the dissatisfaction with that. Only thing as mentioned before is that the optimization isn't top notch so either sacrifice some graphic quality or you need a very beefy rig. Since this title is not AAA league and you can sometimes get it at really low price in a bundle, i dun see why people would complain about being ripped-off. I mean c'mon are you really that cheap? People would pay similar price and be happy with 2D pixelated throwback to the 80s and sidescrolling platformer games i really fail to understand why all the hate towards this game. Give me a 3D game anytime over 2D; it takes much more effort to model real-life object in 3D than fictitious caricatures in 2D. So i have but respect for the developers. If you criticize a game so much and couldn't even produce something better yourself, maybe you should tone down your vitriol. Sorry for my rant in review space. Seems like being hateful is the cool thing these days.Ok so maybe this game is not suitable for young ones with twitchy fingers who expects adrenaline rush. It's relaxing for me and i think it's a good change of pace and setting. That said, i've only begun playing this game so maybe i would find some nasty bugs waiting to eat my savegame or crash my desktop but until then i'd say it's still a good buy if you can get it cheap.Here is the first race. See for yourselves and form your own opinions. Do not be easily swayed or stay away from potentially enjoyable games by negative reviews with no substance.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y74K4YqM-rE"

I learned how to kill someone in over 700 different ways and was assigned to be the leader of a squad that will kill 300 terrorists using gorilla warfare tactics. Also did 6000 push-ups, 8000 sit-ups and bench-pressed 30 plates in 16 minutes. After basic training, I met a network of secret spies who will help me trace your IP address, while eating gold plated sushi and 15,000 $ champagne. My unit got the rest of the day off and I became captain of our base’s football team and starter of the basketball team. I got straight A’s on the military entrance exams and received more awards. Meanwhile, you were jacking off to pictures on Facebook and naked drawn Japanese people. Went back in the Lambo to my barracks and now I am getting ready to go to sleep. I am going to graduate at the top of my class in the Navy Seals tomorrow and I want to look pretty much perfect for it.
