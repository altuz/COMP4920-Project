Played through the normal campaign so far and loved it. Nice story, nice atmosphere, nice riddles...and if you dont like them you can either play a mini game, skip them or get hints. Much love to details. Furthermore you get the soundtrack, some wallpapers and an extra campaign.. Very nice! Recommend it to people who like old-school point and click adventures. Best money spent on Steam in a while."

Never thought I'd care about these hidden object games, to be honest the vast majority of them are tragically primitive. These Artifex Mundi games are not, they're in a class of their own.There's a lot of classic adventure elements in them, you find items, figure out how to combine said items to achieve the result you're after and thusly advance the storyline. Every now and then you're confronted with a hidden object scene, a fact that makes my eyes water and kills my inner child bit by bit. In a stroke of pure brilliance they've added an option to play an alternative game and that way bypass the hidden object scene entirely. What you're left with is an adventure game and occasional boardgame challenges, fantastic.Rather uniquely they also tend to feature strong female protagonists that aren't constantly trying to assert the fact that they're female and strong, they just are. This is something that you'd be hard pressed to find in any other genre.Finally, it works flawlessly in linux. As have all Artifex Mundi games I've tried so far."

Really surprising and a nice return even if it is a different place and story line.  Unlike most 'Find the list' of item games, a lot of the game play is adventourous just like Artifex Mundi's ""Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart"" which I & my 7 year old also enjoyed.I highly recomend this game if 'Find'em games' are your type/style."
,Recommended,284710,18192811,"Posted: 25 September, 2015",all,Faudraline,"The first time I've played this game was around the beginning of summer, looking for a decent HOG to spare the day for. As a HOG lover, I can most assuredly say that Artifex Mundi has always presented me the best examples of the genre, andAbyss: The Wraiths of Edenis no exception.The story is about an underwater city established to seek ""Enlightenment"", mysterious wraiths called as ""legates"" taking control over the city, a limited number of survivors forming a resistance against them, and our poor, frustrated main character who is only there to look for her missing husband. Yes, the plot practically screams theCall of CthulhumeetsBioshock, but the game manages to handle a cliché combination to craft a refreshing setting quite well. As any other Artifex Mundi game, the curtain opens up to an elaborate chaos which could only be sustained by our puzzle solving and item collecting genius.Story and environment, with well-made artwork as always, are interesting enough to keep you going until you complete the game, which can be said for a select few games in this genre. There is a common formula for crafting HOGs which never fails: pick a mystery, add a missing person or at least a high stake, stir the pot with some HOG scenes and offer a complimentary cheesy ending. In our case, it comes with Artifex Mundi caliber artwork. All checked, we are ready to go!Hidden Object scenes are decent, puzzles are fairly simple and adventure elements are easy to track down with the aid of your map. What I'd like to take a note on, is that item usage and combinations actually makes sense too! Playing dominos as an alternative to Hidden Object scenes is creative and entertaining. Oh, and it is possible to finish the game without the aid of any kind of manual or walkthrough.If you like the genre, or maybe the game is on sale, buy it already! It's Artifex Mundi. It basically cannot be bad. If you've playedBioshock, you'll be having a small voice in your head, whispering: ""laaaaame"", but you'll still play it out of curiosity. You are facing another beyond par HOG, you are welcome!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

Took me about 4 hours to complete.  I would have liked longer, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing.  It should also be added that the backgrounds have a stylish art deco feel, and are very pleasing to the eyes.A definite purchase for those who enjoy hidden object/adventure games."
,Recommended,284710,9840999,"Posted: 17 April, 2014",all,Chudah,"I've played maybe 20-30 hidden object games to date (probably more), and I'd have to say Abyss is indeed one of the better ones out there, but has some flaws that really stuck with me as I played.First of all, the game is beautiful.  Although the detailed artwork is clearly inspired by the Bioshock series (and a lot of story elements), it looks great with a colorful palette and some imaginative locations.  There are a lot of areas to explore, as well. The music is very nice and does a good job of setting the mood, but can get a bit repetitive after awhile.For the game play, this is your standard IHOG/HOPA, basically adventure game lite with Hidden Object Scenes sprinkled in.  As an adventure gamer myself, I always play on Expert to give me a bit of challenge and lengthen my game experience, but I found the game to be on the easy side overall.  Not a horrible thing if you're looking for a relaxing evening, but I prefer my IHOGs to last longer than 4 hours on the hardest difficulty. Even the puzzles were fairly easy taking me only a few minutes to figure most out, and many needing only a few moves to complete.  The most challenging part for me was going back and finding older Hidden Object Scenes that have reactivated; they don't sparkle in Expert, so it's basically a game of ""let's click on everything"" in the hopes the scene is indeed active again.  I know this is pretty standard for Expert mode in most HOGs, but honestly, it's just an exercise in frustration, not added challenge.  If the devs are reading this, putting in an option for sparkles on reactivated HOS's would be a much welcome addition in future games.The Hidden Object Scenes themselves are well done, nicely drawn items without too much clutter, and have a nice range of difficulty, but none of the items were what I would consider unfairly hidden.  And although I really enjoy HOS's, I know not everyone is a fan, so the option to play Dominos instead is a nice touch.   The Dominos mini-game itself is fun, relaxing and mildly stimulating,While the story took a lot of elements from Bioshock, it didn't resonate with me as much as some of Artifex Mundi's other games.  I know HOG's aren't exactly a great source of deep, thought-provoking storytelling, but I felt like Abyss was flirting with some really interesting concepts, but those ideas kept getting derailed and neutered.I think my biggest issue came down to the voice acting, though.  Maybe I'm being a little more critical than I should be having come off of a couple of games that had absolutely amazing voice actors, but here...it's just awful.  I wanted so badly to turn off the voices as every time any of the characters uttered something I couldn't help but cringe. If there is anything I would like to see in future HOGs it would be a toggle for the voices.  Sometimes just reading and letting my mind fill in the blanks is better than being stuck with voices that are pulling me out of the experience.That said, I did enjoy the game quite a bit and can see myself playing it again in the future.  I certainly look forward to some of Artifex Mundi's other games making their way to Steam."

76561198141404871,Recommended,284710,18736153,"Posted: 28 October, 2015",all,joan4003,"Yet another utopian society gone awry, this time due to human curiosity. (Though Pandora was not the one who opened the box this time.)Storyline: Marine explorer Robert stumbles upon an underwater city.  Before being able to report his finding he is taken captive by a mysterious entity with glowing red eyes in a black robe.  After not returning from his dive, his female companion sets out to find him.  She follows his underwater trail to the underwater city of Eden.  Once inside she discovers the ruins of a once magnificent underwater utopian metropolis build to seek harmony and peace.  Her mission: Find Robert and along the way she discovers there are others still alive in this decaying city.  Some are survivors, some are rebels, and some are possessed.  Second mission: Escape.   (Any more storyline would spoil the mystery and adventure.)Reveiwers have blasted this game (circa 2012) for various things but the biggest complaint seems to be is it is a rip-off of Bioshock.  I have never played Bioshock so for me it was fresh and I did not compare two entirely different types of games with entirely different storyline concepts.  Besides anything written about any underwater utopia, if one wants to get technical, is a rip-off of Jules Verne's ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" and ""Mysterious Island"" or even Dr. No (the movie) of the James Bond franchise originally authored by Ian Fleming.Gameplay: Beyond the jump scares and the death count, (both of which should be expected due to what occurred in the storyline), the game plays in a sectional linear fashion with a find and use inventory that needs to be completed before being able to move into the next section/area.  The storyline is revealed through discovery as the gamer explores the complex.  Generally there is little backtracking but some items found in some areas can not be used until later in the game.  (So if playing on expert mode remember where there are.)   The Hidden Object scenes are scattered throughout and for the most part are only played once.  There are several times where the same scene is played twice but generally only after the gamer has progressed the storyline.  Certain Hidden Object scenes (generally a replay scene) and certain items only show up after the game progresses.  If stuck in an area that means something has not been done yet.There is a lot of point and click hunt, find and solve to this game.  In my opinion this game leans toward point and click with Hidden Object finds as a secondary.  Which oddly enough works well with the storyline.  The same can be said for the puzzles, despite how random they seem.  The puzzles overall are fairly easy to solve and the usual fare.  However the puzzles work well for where they are, what needs to be done, and how they fit into the storyline.  So overall the continuity remains pretty much in tact.Final note:  In Artifex Mundi tradition, the Hidden Object scenes can be played with an alternative game.  In this case, it is dominoes.  Added 12/12/2015:  Here is a trick to getting the 1 minute time in the dominoes game: Play the Hidden Object scene as List find.  Play until only one List find clue is left then switch to the dominoes game.  Finish the dominoes game and walla achievement earned.Overall, I liked the tight well-written storyline, which though a bit far-fetched is no better or worse then most ""sci-fi horror"" flicks, shows or books.  Oh last thing, there is a rather awkward proposal of marriage at the end which I thought I should mention being such a rare occurence in any game and gives this game a very personal touch."
,Recommended,284710,29082083,Posted: 7 January,all,Mifititi,"Definitely recommended.This game gives me this ""discovering Atlantis"" feel when it comes to the story. It's just that the Atlantis you're looking for might be much creepier and darker than you expected. In this game, the underwater city is called Eden - but without the peace. Depending on your tastes, the truth might be a bit too unrealistic. I thought it was ""believable"" because of the general mysticism and dark depths of the game itself. All in all, it was exciting to play and definitely (at least a bit) creepy at some points.The visuals were simply beautiful. The colors and the details were amazing, especially the scenes in water. The murkiness brought mystery, while keeping a sense of realism - in a more enchanced way. Visually, I have nothing to complain about.The biggest minus is the animation. I liked the voiceovers, they were full of emotion and that is what I like the most about voice acting. Unfortunately, the animation didn't stand up to the voice actors' performance. The art looks real enough, but when they start talking... The mouth movements look really mechanical. Which is a bit ironic, considering the plot of the game. Despite this, it was funny to look at and didn't truly bother me.I enjoyed most of the minigames, especially the dominos that you can do in place of the hidden object scenes. However, if you keep switching between them, you will miss achievements. This games REQUIRES that you play the game at least twice to get every achievement. I personally find it bothersome in games, but since I really liked this one, I didn't mind this time (much).I can fully recommend this to any HOG lover. It might be too casual to some gamers, but the expert mode should give you enough challenge so it wouldn't be boring. This yet another game I have had a physical copy of, so I knew what I was getting when I bought this. I got in on sale but I think it's not too pricy even in full price."
,Recommended,284710,15070677,"Posted: 26 March, 2015",all,lovinglife139,"Let me start off this review by saying that I'm not too well-versed in hidden object games (yet). I played a free-to-play hidden object game years ago and remembered liking it well enough. I love finding things in games. Anything. Collectibles, secret areas, shinies, etc. Heck, I love searching for and finding things in real life, too. I'm a married woman and I still insist on my mother hiding my Easter basket every year. I'm not sure what's sadder; that my mother actually listens to me and hides my basket every year, or that she still gives me one at all.Nonetheless, thanks to the Steam queue, I have been introduced to the genre yet again. I purchased a few on a whim one day, and Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden was the first I played. I was in a casual game type of mood after putting much thought and effort into a lengthy RPG, and this game was really enjoyable in that respect.The game opens up with your character's voice laying out the prologue to the story, and it made me giggle a bit because she sounded like a generic Microsoft computer voice at first. While the environments in this are beautiful and colorful, the entire game has a type of B-movie feel, with iffy voice actors, a ""meh"" story, and no sense of danger at all. The game definitely tries to throw some creepy moments at you, but never did I feel like my character was in danger or that a save would need to be reloaded. The game isn't scary at all for adults, but for young kids, it might be sufficiently creepy on rare occasions (and this game is definitely E-rated).Abyss surprised me in that the game, while in the Hidden Object genre, was not overflowing with hidden object puzzles. I saw one review mention there were too many of them, but I wished for more. The game relies on an exceptionally well done and intelligently designed point and click adventure model for most of the gameplay, and the hidden object screens are mostly a distraction that include an object or two that you'll need to take from the hidden object puzzle and insert into the story gameplay. Sprinkled throughout the game there are also various mini-puzzles that go from sliding puzzles to jigsaw types to wire connecting puzzles. Not once did I feel like a puzzle was out of place or overly complicated. Even if (say, for kids) a puzzle is too confusing or hard, you can skip it. The game encourages you not to via some unlockable achievements, but it is an option. Unlike many point and click games, I never felt like combining objects to meet a goal was unnecessarily complicated. All of them made sense, so this game never frustrates.Overall, while I did wish for more hidden object puzzles, I felt like Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden surprised me in its quality. It's relaxing and takes you on a nice little journey over about a four hour playthrough (I played on Expert despite being fairly new to the genre and never once was frustrated, so it's definitely casual!). While I would personally advise you to wait for a sale because I go by the $1.00 per hour of gameplay rule, I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a casual romp through some pretty environments. I'm giving this a 7/10. This is a great game for kids or for adults looking for a shorter game with little commitment. I was pleasantly surprised with this game, and I now consider myself a fan of the Hidden Object genre."

The puzzles were good, but the hidden object games were too easy (and they were lagging for me during the bonus content). Also, I couldn't always see the reasons behind them. For example,during the bonus, I had to find something, which is okay. But the guy's wife was kidnapped, I thought he would be in a hurry, he only had to grab some small thing, not to paint a plank red, just because the item list told him so. Anyway, he didn't have to use that plank at all, but at least it was painted red. Yay, I guess. Good reason to keep his wife waiting.The soundtrack is repetitive after a time. The jump scares were a bit lame, the plot showed nothing new, but it wasn't bad, I just didn't care about anyone. All in all, the game is not good or bad, just simply meh.

It's a really neat mix of both (and puzzle games) that I enjoyed. Takes roughly 4 hours to beat with the bonus content.The Cons: Voice acting is kind of flat in places, and the lip sync on the 3D model is horrific. It’s the stuff of nightmares. Also, some of the hidden-object game lists use terms that I didn’t recognize or wouldn’t have used, so that can be frustrating (it turns out there’s a mini-game in those parts you can use to skip if you’re having trouble, tho!). The hidden-object parts are sometimes a little iffy in terms of application (why do you spend all this time picking up 20 things when the one thing you wanted was on top?) and there's the ""your knife broke after one use"" adventure-game tendency, which is a pain.The Pros: Story is fairly interesting, if a bit clunkily delivered, scenery is a gorgeous and interesting mix of 3D (moving parts) and somewhat painterly 2D… it’s a little hard to describe but it generally works well. The adventure-game components are like 90% logical and easy to guess, and the rest can be picked up on pretty fast. It's very fun, easy to play while still being challenging and interesting.While the con section is visibly longer, this is still a fun game, and I recommend it, especially on the cheap."

The game has a lot of jumpscares.You play a woman (whose name does not come up in the game iirc) trying to find her fiancee who went missing at sea while diving.  When following his footsteps she discovers a mysterious underwater city.The art is beautiful and the music is good. The puzzles, I found, were either a bit too easy with a few exceptions with ""wtf am I doing -spamclick until it works-"". The game has 3 difficulty levels, the lowest difficulty shows actions availible on the ingame map and everything useful in the world sparkles. On the hardest no availables are shown and there is no sparkle.There is an achievement for not using hints in the HO scenes, but for progressing in the world the hint button is near spammable. As an option instead of the HO scenes this game has a domino game you can do. To get all the achievements in the game you have to go through the game twice; once playing hidden objects and once with dominos. My playtime is one game on hardest difficulty and HO scenes and once with skipping absolutely everything and speeding it.Pretty much all cutscenes and dialogues are skippable. The map has no teleport option and is mostly useless on the harder modes as you're unlikely to be lost. The story is good,, though I wish you learned more about the world in the game.The game is the Collector's edition by default, so it has an extra chapter when you're done with the game as well as wallpapers, music etc. Small nuisance of how the opening cutscene to the game starts playing every time you open it, before the main menu, but as it's skippable it's not a big problem. I encountered no bugs and the game ran smoothly. As tends to be with this company the animation cutscenes is the least impressive part of the game, but still they're not terrible."

The plus side is that there are a lot of puzzles to solve, but many of them are similar to puzzles in other games of these types (and in at least one case, exactly identical). The human models are some of the most terrifying I've ever seen, and there's a weird, inconsistent blend of hand-drawn art with CG art. Also, constantly having to go up and down an elevator with no way to skip the animation was really annoying.Unlike Alex Hunter, it has achievements and trading cards, so if that's important to you, it's the only thing it really has over it. So, no, I can't give a strong recommendation unless you just can't get enough of these types of games.Rating: 2/5"

This story was interesting from start to finish and moved smoothly through the game-play. The puzzles weren't too difficult and the hidden object portion was sometimes a little too easy (if you prefer there is a dominoes game you can play instead) but overall it was a fun 5 hours. I definitely recommend if you like this genre. OH and while it's definitely not scary it was pretty spooky to play with headphones on in the dark. Very fun for the month of October!

There is a hint system, although you most likely won't need it, and you can always choose to substitute a game of dominos if you get stuck.  They also use common English/British synonyms for all of the item names (which may sound like a minor point, but is a big deal for those of us who have played other HOGs where a ""fishnet"" could be labeled as a ""landing,"" or where items are randomly in a foreign language for no reason).As for the mini-games, they are intuitive and fairly easy, and never feel tedious or like filler.  Instead, you feel a sense of accomplishment, as each mini-game serves to advance the plot in some way.Additionally, the point-and-click puzzles are logical.  It was always pretty obvious what an item was going to be used for, so there was never any sense of frustration.  If for some reason you aren't sure of where to go next, though, your map (on the easier difficulties) will show you where you can perform actions.  Experienced gamers will not find this game challenging, even on the highest difficulty rating, but it is worth playing through anyway just to experience the setting and the craftsmanship of the gameplay.  I played through multiple times in one day so I could get all of the achievements, and it never got old.The voice acting is top-notch, the music provides just the right amount of creepiness or action, the backgrounds are beautiful, and even the CG people aren't horrible to look at.The game is fairly short, less than 3 hours, but there is an optional bonus mission that adds depth and backstory to the characters.  Also, while there is a fair amount of backtracking, they make it feel fresh by having many areas change visually upon revisiting them.All in all, I would give this game a 9.5/10, and feel it is worth the full $7.99.  It is far superior to any other HOG I have played."

The storyline at least is somewhat different from its thematic inspiration, so it doesn't feel like a complete retread.In terms of gameplay the HOG scenes all play fine, and the puzzles were also pretty good - a reasonable mix and a moderate difficulty in most cases, and the point and click sections in between it all works well enough, nothing too illogical or jarring, and of course the HOG genre fits quite well into this semi-apocalyptic scenario of scavenging around for tools and clues as to what is happening. An alternative to playing the HOG scenes - dominos - is available, although it is pretty bland, and it seems a bit odd when these sorts of things are provided, as it seems unlikely there is big market of people that would play a HOG if the HOG scenes weren't there, as they tend to make pretty weak point and click puzzlers with this part taken away.As has been mentioned in other reviews, one of the weaknesses here is the animations when characters are talking to you which makes them look like mannequins (although due to they story in a few cases this is somewhat appropriate), which is a bit jarring. Another minor issue is that the achievements are set up so you have to play the game twice - once doing only HOG scenes, once playing Dominos at each such scene, in order to get 100%.However in summary this is a well made, if derivative, game that is easy to play, mildly challenging in places, and with an okay storyline and atmosphere."

These and gals make the finest Hidden Object Games (HoG) of all time, in my mind.  And this is one of their best!  A masterful adventure into an underwater, art-deco world, not unlike the Bioshock originals.  Many fun horror elements to keep an edge to the immersive atmosphere, as you find and assemble various parts and pieces of the story puzzles, with good actual puzzles throughout.  There were only about a half dozen or so hidden object screens, which was nice as it seemed to fit into the story nicely.  Some good animations too, in fact more than I remembered from previous games.  Game play time ran about 8 hours for me, which for the sale price was right on target.On a 10 point scale, I give this game a solid 8.5I can only give so many points, because I'm not really a HoG fan.

But unfortunately, the Buzz Killington characters ended up slowly sucking the life out of it over the course of the game. The wraiths turn out to be more awkwardly annoying than menacing and both protagonists nearly put me to sleep. I will say however, the protagonists do turn out to be perfect for each other as both have personality traits reminiscent of vanilla ice cream without the vanilla flavoring. Although they used all the right words to convey drama, the voice acting just didn't bring it. How they managed to convey such a consistent, underlying dial tone of emotional nothingness in such an extreme situation is still a mystery to me. Perhaps that's the ""Abyss"" the developers are referring to in the game's title?Although the graphics and cutscenes were crisp, I thought the art (although conceptually interesting enough) looked a little lazy compared to similar games of this type - or maybe that has more to do with it being from 2012 - or maybe that's a style choice and part of it's charm - dunno? The hidden object puzzles' difficulty was about average and the mini games were standard fare. The gameplay itself was fine. I especially liked being able to harass the sea life with my clicks and the ability to hold my breath for much longer periods of time than I'm normally able. Although this game gave me sads because of what I consider lost potential, it's still a decent P&C/HOG and worth a recommend. Played well for me on Linux Mint 18.PS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review. So Steam only shows that I played 0.3 hrs as of the time of this review, although I've played at least 5 hrs and have completed the game."

The graphics are fairly nice, the story is trite but adequate, the voice acting is mostly tolerable, the puzzles enjoyable, and the Steam Achievements a bit irritating.  If you've played any Artifex Mundi HOGS, there's nothing unexpected.  Really, the only minor negatives are those Steam Achievements:  the HOG and the Dominoes Achievements are mutually exclusive.  So, to get 100% Achievements, you're forced to do two run-throughs.  And, as usual, since there are no saves, if you mess up, you have to finish that run-through regardless and then do it again.  One thing to point out with this game (like a lot of these HOGs) is that it's old enough that the user profile is not saved in the Steam folders or even in the standard Saved Games folder.  Instead, it's saved in the hidden folder [username]\AppData\Roaming\ArtifexMundi\Abyss_TheWraithsOfEden\CE.  So, if you're worried about losing it, make sure you back that up.I got about 9.6 hours of good game play out of the game (6.5 hours for the first run-through with the Bonus Chapter and another 3.1 hours for the second run-through).  So, even at it's list price, the game is close to being worth it.  Of course, if you can find it on sale (as I did), then go ahead and snap it up."

I think this could have just been made as a flash game if not for the full voice acting and partial 3d animation, both of which were poorly done.

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.That's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.They do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.My recommendation, because of the ""if you've played one you've played them all"" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games."

The story is meh, the animated sequences are worse and riddled with clipping errors, and the voice-acting is, well, not really deserving of the term ""acting"". And in order to obtain all achievements you have to play through the whole slog at least twice (ideally once for all the hidden-object scenes and once for their domino-based alternatives). At least you can go through it for a second time rather quickly, as skipping the animations and talk parts is possible in most cases and without them the game is actually rather short (roughly 3 hours).So, while I won't completely condemn this game, I'd say get it only if you're a fan of the genre and don't care too much about decent storytelling and acting."

I did find the plot cheesy (not in the good way) and was a little disappointed because it starts the game having me very intrigued. Also the facial expressions of the other characters can be creepy at times. Other wise it is an enjoyable game with steam achievements that only require a couple of play throughs (by then you will have masted all the puzzles). 6/10

Like most of their games, there's decent variety in the scenes and puzzles combined with just enough running around, item combo, and actual story line to keep you interested throughout the game.  You do locate a map in this game, which becomes helpful in the later part of the story when you are running around more.The ending was done well and leaves itself open for a sequel.  If there is a sequel, I will definitely play it.  Side note - I also enjoyed the bonus chapter, which is a prequel for two of the characters in the main storyline."

Great graphics, art deco meets underwater steampunk style.  There is a fun horror-esque surprise element that gets your attention without being gruesome.  The storyline makes resonable sense and kept my attention.  I finished the whole thing plus the bonus chapter in about 4 hours, which is about twice as long as most of the ridiculously-short hidden object games out there.  I'd file this game as more of a point-and-click adventure game, with some HOG screens thrown in.  The HOG screens are colorful and varied enough to be fresh as the game went on."

The wraiths look terryfying like a Scooby Doo villian and when I saw Greg I thought he was a villian and it turned out he was a good guy and on your side in the game. The graphics and sound work and objects are easy to find and was quite interesting to see your character get knocked out by someone or trapped and having to rescue your lover and others. The bonus chapter is a prequel and focuses on Greg where it shows his wife and how they were enslaved by the wraiths which was sad, and usually in these games the bonus is a sequel to the main story."

The describe it as a scary and thrilling story, but if you played Bioshock there are some familiarities, mainly of the ground concept of underwater City that was meant to be heaven on earth, where men could be free and it was a place for smart people, then something happend and now everything is horror themed. I wouldn't call it scary, even if they try to set the mood early on in the game. But it's hard to feel scared when you move by clicking yourself from place to place. The do it as well as you can though. The game features the same quality of artwork that I've come to expect from them. Good ambiance, music and sounds. Voice acting is in general okey, except for a few who went for an oscar and failed. It's not as good as the later titles from Atrifex Mundi, but still a solid game, and if you haven't played the later titles, it's great to start on, to see what they have to offer in the terms of quality. Puzzles aren't as hard as the later titles either, which can be a positive or negative, depending on how good you are at them. Overall a recommend! 6.8/10"

Its still a good plot none the less. All the puzzles are simple to figure out or are the type where if you click randomly for like ten seconds you can get them. The object scenes are easy and quick to do and there arnt many of them and this isnt the type of game where you have to consitantly look around to make sure your not missing a scene. The game does a good job of leading you around to all the clues and it only took me lke two hours to do. There are a few jump scares that got me pretty good or caused my heart to race. There is also a bonus scene/story at the end that talks about another persons point of view of what was happening before the main character was on the scene. Simple and easy game to figure out and play. I didnt get stuck in any way and their are hint and skip buttons if you wish to use them.
