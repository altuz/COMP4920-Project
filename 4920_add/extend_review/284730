,Recommended,284730,29233523,Posted: 13 January,all,Faudraline,"Hailing from the Artifex Mundi catalog,Dark Arcana: The Carnivalisn't probably one of the best games brilliant HOG developer/producer team presented us so far. You see, said publisher has spoiled us to the degree of expecting narrative quality and story consistency from ordinary hidden object games alongside artistic quality in display, so compared to some prior master pieces, this one feels a bit pallid. Yet, it is still a charming enough game to go for in a lazy evening, endowed with your casual Artifex Mundi display quality.We are yet another lady detective, this time summoned to the place of the local carnival to investigate an unusual case. A little girl's mother has disappeared, leaving her in an anonymous crowd of a carnival, of all places. Usually, it should be the other way around, right? Little girl disappears and the mother pleads that we should find her? Nope, not this time. Presented with the photograph of her mother quite conveniently, we start our search. Through our investigation, we are quick to notice that the only current inhabitant of this colorful yet creepy place, is the master of the carnival: knife-thrower extraordinaire Jim Gibbons. He also has a spectacular talent of avoiding us, so we keep tracking Jim to the point of travelling to a mirror dimension where everything ends up as an eerie, twisted version of the original. This is one persistent detective, I tell you!Track the victim, learn the reasons of the perpetrator, save the day. Text-book hidden object story pace, alongside the millionth Hollywood action movie. Even though the earlier parts of the game are a bit ambiguous and unrealistic - detective chasing after Jim and casually hopping down into mirror world without even going through ""wait, what, alien dimensions are real?"" phase - , the game makes up for the most with a neatly arranged plot-twist nearing the middle. The rest is your casual puzzle solving genius, wrapped around a tragic and desperate romance.The theme of choice is a big plus, if you ask me, considering travelling carnivals have always been the melting pot of the eerie and the spectacular for the Western culture. The Ferris wheel, lion tamer, acrobats, knife-throwers, fortuneteller, freak shows... you name it. Anything extraordinary comes with it, which doesn't necessarily mean safe or reliable. All the artwork here in this game, are accordingly appropriate for the theme: half-way enwrapped in vibrant colors and innocent displays of wonder. Yet, the moment we travel to the mirror world, everything turns into an elegant creep fest. I loved every single scene of it. This package of display comes with decent character animations, believable voice-acting and an efficient soundtrack. Kudos for the display, as always.Gameplay consists of various HOG scenes, yet you get to visit the same scenes over and over again in their doubles: the original world version and the mirror world version. It becomes a bit annoying after a while. They are fairly easy to go through though, taking just a bit of your attention span. If you are bored of HOG scenes, you are presented with an alternative Monaco gameplay to replace it, which is a nice flavor. Puzzles are not really challenging, most of it is flavor for the setting, nothing more. Which really makes the game lose some points is the excruciating amount of backtracking though. If you are playing in expert difficulty for the sake of the achievement, it becomes a chore to go through all areas that might have opened in the given time.As the last word,Dark Arcana: The Carnivalis an okay HOG with a nice little story, enchanting setting and somewhat tedious gameplay. I'd recommend going for it in a sale, or as the part of a bundle rather than jumping into it. If you are familiar with the developer team, you'll find this one likable anyhow. If not, I strongly recommend a much more well-crafted title to begin. Good day, and good gaming to you!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

You put together solid narratives, do interesting things with your plots, invest some time in your puzzles, and put out consistently good products. The monkey helper doesn't quite rate against the kitten helper, but this is still a sturdy little adventure. A lot of your games in this line are beautiful to play, but I can see why this one doesn't have the same aesthetic.But let's talk about something, ok? Flint and steel. The rock shaves off tiny pieces of steel, and the combination of friction and the steel itself cause the steel to briefly burn. So: sparks.Banging two pieces of flint together just makes more chips of flint. No sparks.  You can keep giving me puzzles where I use pieces of flint to start fires if you want, this is a game, not a survival manual, but I want you to know: it does not work."
,Recommended,284730,26331299,"Posted: 31 October, 2016",all,Mifititi,"Recommended.The plot of this game isn't really anything new; rescue a person and save the world from destruction. Most HOGs are like that, but I still liked it either way. Even if the story is typical, the game is still enjoyable. I can't really say more without spoilers, so I'll just leave it at that.The visuals are definitely what drew me to this game. They are beautiful, both colorful and haunting, which I think they're supposed to be since it's Dark and Carnival. The cut scenes were okay and didn't stand out to me, except for one character's eyes were kind of scary because I didn't almost see his irises at all. I do think that the animation is a bit clumsy somehow, maybe the characters' movements are jerky?Even though it's a hidden object game, first and foremost, I prefer minigames and puzzles about these games and there were a lot of different ones. I wouldn't say they are anything new, but still good nonetheless. One minigame annoyed me, so I skipped it. (And lost a chance to get one achievement...) Hidden object scenes are not particularly hard and since you visit one scene at least once, it gets easy to remember where you saw and what. Also, I liked my little monkey helper Miles.If I have to say one thing that I didn't like, is the fact that you have to play this game twice (and once on Expert Mode) to get all the achievements. Even if I liked the game, I don't want to have to play the whole game again (at least not immediately) just to get the rest of the achievements.This is yet another game I owned a physical copy of, so I knew what I was getting when I bought it. I liked the story (especially after I finished the game), the puzzles and pretty locations, and my monkey helper. It took me 2,5 hours to finish the whole game (but not all achievements), so it's not very long. I bought this on sale, but I think it's worth the full price."
,Recommended,284730,20918342,"Posted: 2 February, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"Investigating the disappearance of Susan Jones in a fair, you're getting sucked into a world that is a darker version of the place. Jim Gibbons seems to be behind that but why? It's up to you to discover the truth.The story is well-written and full of twists. While the outcome is expected, the way to attain it is surprising.Anyway, if you're used to hidden objects games, Dark Arcana isn't a revolution: the hidden objects scenes are really easy, the puzzles aren't too hard. However, the addition of Miles, the little monkey, is nice. He can go grab objects out of your reach for you. And he makes noises when he's needed. However, what is disappointing is the fact that the map isn't used for travelling. After a while, you may be tired to go back and forth between two locations.As I've said, Dark Arcana is set in a dark world and it's well represented without it being scary. I would have preferred more dark settings as the whole mirror world is yellowish. The soundtrack is also good: while the tune is known to be used in any fair settings, the small remix is enough to show that you're not in a joyful world.Dark Arcana comes with bonus. I'm not speaking about achievements or trading cards. I'm speaking about the soundtrack you can save, wallpapers, hidden objects scenes, concept art or a bonus chapter, where you're Jim and if I remember well, is a sequel to the events.Anyway, if Dark Arcana isn't innovative, it's still a very good hidden object from Artifex Mundi. And well, while it has not the quality of Nightmares from the Deep or Grim Legends or even 9 Clues 2: The Ward, it's still better than some other games out there."

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.That's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.They do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.My recommendation, because of the ""if you've played one you've played them all"" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games."

Unfortuntely as others have pointed out it's really short with puzzles that are a little to easy at times, a that story seems more like cliff notes and a game that rushes to the end before you really have a chance to enjoy it. I like playing games like this because I can take my time and savor the artistic style of the world the game takes part in, but in this case I barely got a chance to look at anything before the game was over.Its still a fun game if a little short and sweet so if thats what your looking for then by all means check it out. Otherwise you might want to look at some other titles cause even after the bonus adventure this one just left me wanting more, in a bad way."
,Not Recommended,284730,31762847,Posted: 14 May,all,Colonel Cupcake,"TL;DR An Artifex Mundi game that is substantially easier and less detailed than their other games, with some duplicate HOG sections.Pros:+ Quality environments (standard Artifex Mundi)+ interesting plot+ good ""creepy"" vibeCons:+ repeated HOG section+ simplicity+ lengthI'm a pretty big Artifex Mundi fan and I would unfortunately say that this one is my least favorite so far. It's certainly good for a HO game, but I can't recommend it when compared to the other installations in Artifex Mundi's lineup.There are two HO sections where some of the objects are exactly the same, in the exact same locations: come on guys...The rest of the game is pretty good, but much simpler, less detailed, and overall less intriguing than some of the other games by them. In addition to this, I completed the game in just over 2 hours, which is not ideal. I tend to expect around 5-6 for their games, so I was let down by the relatively short length.All in all, if you love the Artifex Mundi games (as I do), you won't hate this one, but you will be dissapointed when compared to the others.Happy gaming!"

The protagonist is a detective that must rescue a woman who disappeared in a strange carnival. This time I noticed that other languages are better translated (like Italian) so it's easier to do HOG scenes in my mother tongue, but there are some mistakes (it's hard finding an object in a HOG scene if the name is so badly translated that you can't recognize it) so for now it's better playing in English. The scenery is beautyful as usual and the extra chapter after the main adventure is a nice bonus. If you still haven't played a HOG (really???) this game is perfect to get a new addiction."

The game seems a little on the short side, but the story and the well done eerie atmosphere does tend to make up for it. The point and click sections that link everything together are also well enough done (although the monkey animations are pretty dodgy).There were three flaws that did stand out, with one being the repetitiveness of some of the HOG scenes - while the two parallel worlds theme was quite cool, and reusing but warping some of the locations was a good idea, it meant you ended up doing the same scene up to 3 times in some cases, often having to find a bunch of the exact same items in the exact same places - now where the item had changed a lot this sort of worked, but plenty of the items don't significantly change so it just feels too much like a retread.The other two main negatives were the naming bugs in a couple of the HOG scenes (if you are told to look for a Windwill, it means a fan, and one time you are told to look for a record but it means a plate/large bowl, and in the bonus content the plate they ask you to find is actually a record, etc.) The other issue I had was the puzzles, which were all easy, tending to trivial,"

(If anyone knows games where you just get the puzzles, no story, no hidden objects, let me know.)As to the rest, the images (scenes) are pleasant, the hidden object games and story are nice (and as mentioned, I don't actually play this for them), the alternative to the hidden object games is interesting too (though it took me a bit to realize that column, symbol, and row wouldn't remove objects, but cards in the Monaco game).It was entertaining enough to play through 3 times, to complete the achievements. (First time I alternated between HO/Monaco a few times, so be sure I got them all, I did the expert mode right after the first play-through, with only Monaco, and another easy play-through for HO.) I would have liked to be able to complete the achievements by doing the HO and Monaco in the Extras, sadly that didn't work. (Or I just tried the wrong ones?)Can't say anything about the music. There are few games where I don't turn it off first thing.Overall, some hours spent in an entertaining manner. I got the game on sale for 1.99 euro, and if you're not as uber stingy as I, it could well be worth twice that.

The goal-oriented gameplay and steam acheivements kept me interesed.PROS:-Casual and relaxing. Play at your own pace.-A few of the puzzles were challenging.CONS:-Most puzzles, including hidden object games, were too easy, even on expert mode. Monaco was boring as heck.-Sometimes the solutions to problems were just dumb. For example, how the items were meant to be used and the obstacles  that were placed in your way.- Challenges & solutions had very little to do with the story and made little sense. Gameplay and storyline were not cohesive. The story only served as a transition between puzzles."

The puzzles were good except for the sliding up in down puzzles, those I had to skip.  Maybe I'm just bad at them but just saying.  I liked the story even though it's a little cheesy.  Great hidden object game for sure."

SO far I have been pleased with that (3 games completed) decision :-) Less fat, a faster and keener eye. The means of improving the games remain the same. Make the puzzles a bit more difficult, hidden object scenes are well made but more clutter would be welcome. Keep those weekly discounts going and I may get over my doughnut addiction eventually :-)"

There are awesome puzzles that can be challenging, but easy enough to make skipping pointless.The skipping and unlimited hints are very useful when playing for the first time!One thing I did not enjoy was how fast it ended. I undertsand the game would be ruined if it was any longer, but it was just so fun to play!I recommend playing this game if you like creepy fantasy games."

While it's not unusual for their games to have the occasional touch of the macabre or some occult-laced storytelling, these influences become the dominant theme in Dark Arcana. If you like that sort of thing (and I can't say I mind it too much), you'll probably love this game. If you don't, you can probably just give it a pass, and if you're indifferent, it's another AM puzzle/HO release, which is enough to recommend it as is."

Most puzzles are similar to things they've done for with a few intesting new ones.This game gives you a monkey helper as an extra tool. I liked the spooky-circus-themed music and the art is very good.As usual from this company getting 100% achievements requires 2 playthroughs, one were you play all the hidden object scenes and one were you choose to play the sidegame instead, in this game you play a strange version of match-2.I thoroughly enjoyed this one, probably one of my favourite AM games when it comes to story. The story is spooky and the world is interesting. The story I felt was less predictable than some of the other games."

It has an interesting art style and story line along with plenty of challenging puzzles. The only downsides are that it takes such a long time to play and the animations aren't the greatest, but other than that, it's a really fun and addictive game. I would totally suggest this game to anyone."

I love the dark creepiness to it and the whole carnival aspect. The only downside I would say is that a lot of the hidden objects blend in a little too well with the overall background, but then again, you also don't want it to be too easy. Still, I rate it a 10/10.Pros:-Great story-Love the scenery and theme-Mirror world is a fantastic conceptCons:-Some objects may be too well hidden (but really, this isn't THAT big of a deal and I probably wouldn't want that changed either)"

It is a great hidden object game, and I got more play time out of it than others that were more expensive (Clockwork Man). Cool story however, a little too creepy for my nine year old.

Definitely recommend, but probably get it on sale, not full price."

I found myself bored with the story, clicked through most of the scenes and found the items without reading the list, and the monkey animation was horrible and annoying. However, I played through it, so it wasn't the worst thing in the world. It didn't make you go back too far across places to collect items and use them again in a different scene, so it has that as a plus."
