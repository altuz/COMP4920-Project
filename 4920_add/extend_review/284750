,Recommended,284750,24751704,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,Usagi,"I’m writing my review forEnigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creekfrom an interesting perspective; I’ve played it twice. I first played this game a year ago and jumped into it again to do a revised review and prepare for the release of the third title in the series. Since my first playthrough, I’ve played many other hidden object games and I feel I have a different perspective. That all being said,Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creekis still an amazing game. It’s an older title, from 2011, but the fact that it can still hold up as one of my favorite games now in 2016 shows how well it was made. Great story, good gameplay and fitting aesthetics all come together making this title shine.You’re put in the role of a detective with a slight case of amnesia, she knows who she is but not why she’s in Maple Creek. Part of the story’s charm is learning everything that is going on which technically the main character already knew about beforehand. You’re on the case of a missing young woman in the town and soon find out from your notes that many other ladies have been disappearing for years in Maple Creek. As the protagonist is a detective, she sees everything from a logical perspective while in truth, the events happening in the town are far from logical or the norm. She has stumbled upon a world of ritualistic sacrifices, mind control, demons and death; a world that will follow her to the next game in the series. Along the way she meets other characters, most notably Detective Richard Hamilton who had a loved one go missing in Maple Creek. Hamilton has a vendetta against those that took his beloved away and aids the protagonist with her adventures in this game and the sequels.This game and others in this series are hidden object games, and are very old school. The game has more hidden object scenes than puzzles so that may turn some players off. Also, you’ll be visiting the same hidden object scenes twice or more as well. I counted five hidden object scenes in the first ten or twenty minutes alone. Another thing to note is that the hidden object scenes are difficult. They’re pure clutter and can require a player to stare for a while trying to find an item, some of which are hidden in tricky spots. I often found myself trying to find that one last item and spending a few frustrating minutes squinting at the screen. The game is light on puzzles, as mentioned before, and none are too difficult. A nice feature the game has is an evidence board, since you’re a detective, you use it to try and piece together facts and remember things and also solve the case. A feature I did not like was the inability to teleport. You do have a map which shows you places you need to visit but you can’t teleport to any of them which can mean a lot of backtracking.For an older title, the graphics in the game are pretty good. The tone is well set with music and dreary colors making the town of Maple Creek even more ominous. I only have two issues. Firstly, the hidden object scenes, as I said, are very cluttered so if you have bad eyes be warned. Secondly, the animation isn’t too great, when characters speak their mouths don’t move realistically. That, however, is minor. The game also has full voice acting which is very well-done, despite the lack of lyp-sync. Well, the main character and the preacher are good, anyway. Everyone else is satisfactory, but I wasn’t a fan of Hamilton’s voice acting.  Good to great voice acting kept the story compelling.All I can say is buyEnigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek, play it and then grab the sequels. I enjoyed the story, I enjoyed the twist of the main character having memory loss and forgetting she had already solved the case, I enjoyed the gameplay, it’s just a well made game all around. Sure, there are some flaws and some things I personally don’t like. The game is an older one but despite that, it stands up well against some more modern games that don’t offer nearly as much. If I could use the map to teleport, it would be a perfect game. Despite how frustrating I found the backtracking I might play this title a third time at some point. It has Steam trading cards and achievements and it should be in your library if you’re a fan of hidden object games.Usagi’s RatingMust buy.A good game to buy.Only buy if on sale.Mediocre.Avoid at all costs.Lunar Productions"

,Recommended,284750,22233240,"Posted: 4 April, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"If there is something that I hate, it's to see that I didn't review all of Artifex Mundi's games, whether they're the publishers or the developers. I was convinced to have reviewed Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek, that I was making big eyes when I saw that, no, I didn't.I reinstalled the game and replayed it. I wasn't going to use my memory for this one.Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek is the first Enigmatis and is developped by Artifex themselves. In it, you wake up in a town, without any recent memories. You just know that you were there to solve a disappearance. But the more you're learning about Maple Creek, the more you'll understand that the reverend is behind something monstruous.The story is well-written as usual and is using a feature used rarely in the genre: amnesia about the case, meaning that you'll investigate everything again, though there are now more obstacles: Maple Creek got some damage due to a storm, the residents are going to the church, with a bell that doesn't end to ring, your own car has an accident and now, Hamilton, a missing detective, is showing himself.The gameplay is pretty quite the standard one: find items, use them to reveal new paths or puzzles, clear hidden objects scenes, etc.. However, I can tell that the game is an old one: indeed, you have a lot of hidden objects scenes, which you're often visiting (though previous items found aren't put back, which is nice) and with a lot of items in them. Some objects are hard to find, as they can be mistaken for an element in the background. Puzzles, however, are easy to do.There is a specific feature: you have a case board, where you'll pin clues, which will lead to new questions. It's a nice way to focus on the case, instead of reading a diary and trying to find solutions in the pages of it.However, there is a large problem for the navigation: indeed, some arrows are close to each other (like the balcony on your hotel room) meaning that some misclickings will happen: I wanted to go back to my room from the balcony but because I was going too fast, I wasn't pointing on the right area and I ended up to the garden. Also, the map isn't interactive at all: you can't use it for fast travel.The graphics are very correct, like with any Artifex Mundi's game, and are sticking to the story in itself: don't expect any sun, as you're doing everything in one night, in a deserted town, with some exploring in the forest and with some damage due to a storm.As usual, the soundtrack is very good.As it's a special edition, you'll end up with a bonus chapter, with Hamilton's first contact with Maple Creek 30 years before the plot of the main story.Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek is as usual a very good title for playing casual adventures, with an important presence of hidden objects scenes as it was released first during a period where the genre was aiming towards its actual version. While you don't need it to understand the sequel, I recommend to begin by Maple Creek, to really have a better connection with people you'll meet in Ravenwood."
,Recommended,284750,28161456,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,Mifititi,"Recommended.Considering the word GHOST appears in the title, you can expect the story to be spooky and mysterious. And it was exactly that. One conclusion in the game leads to more questions, so it's sure to keep you curious until the end. You might guess some plot twists ahead, but I believe there'll also be those that surprise you. I think anyone who likes a nice thriller filled story will have a good time with this one.Due the nature of this game, the art was quite dark and very realistic. Normally in games, I prefer more fairy tale like visuals, bright colors and beautiful objects, but this game is good just the way it is. The more realistic everything looks, the spookier everything is.The gameplay is pretty usual - except the part where you actually ARE the detective. You need to draw conclusions on your own, the character you play as only nudges you toward the right direction. It was a really nice add and really makes you feel like you are a detective.However, the game also has aspects that I wasn't too fond of - particularly, no jump map. You have to go back and forth A LOT. Admittedly, this game is not the newest, so I can give it a break on that. One thing that almost made me give this game thumps down was the hidden object scenes themselves. First of all, there were so many. Second, they're quite challenging. I grew extremely frustrated with them, especially since I lost one achievement for using ONE HINT.After replaying the game to get that one achievement and finishing the bonus chapter, I'm left satisfied. It was a bit too challenging for my tastes - namely the hidden object scenes - but since I managed to actually replay immediately again, I didn't hate the hidden object scenes that much. Consindering the cost isn't that high, I say give it a try. (If you dare.)"

A solid Artifex Mundi title.Long version:Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek isn’t the kind of game that knows how to set a tone, but when it eventually gets the story rolling, it suddenly turns one of the most overused HO clichés (heroine searches for someone in a small town ruled/haunted by a supernatural evil entity) into an electrifying serial murder mystery. With a really decent voice acting to boot.There are very few conventional puzzles and even the item usage is quite straightforward and limited; the focus is on the hidden object scenes, crammed full of items, giving a surprising level of difficulty. A welcomed change for experienced HO gamers.The only real problem is that the map: you cannot fast travel with it, even though there is a lot of backtracking– the story requires you to do several laps around the town, easily reaching 4-6 hours of game time."

But after playingMountain Crime: Requital, I found myself wanting to try more of these 'hidden objects' games. From a bit of research into the genre I learned that most people argue that developerArtifex Mundipretty much equals a good 'hidden objects' game. AndEnigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creekwas on sale (-70%) so the choice was made.Again, I was pleasantly surprised. The hidden objects puzzles are just one type of puzzle that appear in the game, though repetitively, and there's no pixel hunting involved. There are about an equal amount of other puzzles to be solved, and there's the classic exploration and collecting items to use on other items to further the story, like in other point & click adventure games.The puzzles inEnigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creekare clever, challenging and fun. Exploring the town is exciting because of the mysterious atmosphere and because advancing in the game (i.e. opening parts of the town you couldn't enter before) feels satisfying, like you actually accomplished something through thinking and you feel rewarded for that.The storyI don't want to spoil the story so I'll only give you a brief synopsis: you're a female detective looking for a missing child when a car accident strands you in a small town called Maple Creek. You don't half remember what exactly happened to you, but you soon notice that something's just not right with the town of Maple Creek... It's up to you to discover the mystery of the town and to try and find the missing girl.The story is compelling enough to want to see it through, and the promise of a direct sequel that continues the story made be buyEnigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwoodright away, so that's saying something.The difficulty and length of the gameThe way to advance in the game, be it through adventuring or through solving puzzles, is always logical so it's never frustratingly hard. Should you find yourself stumped, there's a hint button that you can press. It will point you to the next point where action is required, or allow you to skip a puzzle altogether.It takes about 7 hours to complete the game.On Steam's extra featuresEnigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creekhas 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.There are 11 Steam Achievements. I appreciated the achievements because they motivate the player to not use the hint button, to not just click around like crazy until something happens, and so on. They are optional, of course, but they add a bit more challenge to the game for those who want the achievements, which is what I think Steam Achievements are supposed to be like."

I was very tempted to hit the hint button many times where I've never really felt that when playing any other Artifax Mundi game so far. If it wasn't for the achievement to finish all HO puzzles without hitting the hint button I probably would have.Some of the names also make you think. For a very simple example, ""arrow"". Hmmm, I can't find an archery arrow, maybe I should be looking for the shape instead.Cons:There are three or four objects that it seems have part of the hotspot for clicking it missing. I found this to be a negligable issue. If you clicked on it in a typical spot it will react appropriately.Yes, the male detective's voice acting is pretty bad, but I could personally get past that pretty easily.For some reason I couldn't type my name in the new player box so had to go with the default ""Player"", ""Player1"", ""Player2"" etcetera naming scheme which I found to be a very minor issue since the only time I see it is when I'm switching players (which I never do).Depends how you see it:There are a few objects with odd names a negative reviewer here mentioned like skein for a ball of yarn, but what I thought while I was playing is that this will help me to expand my vocabulary.

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.That's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.They do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.My recommendation, because of the ""if you've played one you've played them all"" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games."

Also, I find the achievement system way too easy, I literally got every single achievement during my first playthrough and while I don't really have any problems with this, I think that the achievements should encourage at least an extra playthrough, which again, is another issue which along with the previous one was fixed in the sequel.All in all: It's another great game from Artifex Mundi, being the third game from them which I have played, my favorite one is still Enigmatis 2. If you're interested in the series, I strongly recommend you to play the sequel first which has an overall better presentation and eventually play the prequel as well, in case if you're becoming interested in the sequel's backstory."

It's got a plot that's suspenseful with that whole murder mystery stuff going on, some paranormal wackiness, and overall it's pretty fun to play.Neat Stuff:* When taking things from Hidden Object puzzles, they STAY taken. Like, I don't know what this detective does with the crap she doesn't need but she doesn't toss it back in the puzzle, and new junk doesn't just randomly appear either. It makes the scenes more challenging as the hidden objects actually look like they belong, and it makes them easier as the game progresses and the more you complete a particular scene.* The junk in the Hidden Object puzzles is relavant to the scenes. The piles upon piles of nonsense make sense in the storm-stricken areas, where houses have been blown through and wind dumped stuff in a tangle of laundry lines. The 'scary' places don't have stuff like bowling balls just hanging around (though they do have some weird stuff)Lame Stuff:* No fast travel through the map. Have to tediously go through each part of the map to get where you're going - no shortcuts.* Despite claiming to be a detective, the heroine doesn't keep things that are obviously useful after using them. Sometimes they'll stick around for the next puzzle, but she discards them pretty quickly. I know this lady's concussed and all after that car accident, but get it together girl.* The detective takes forever to piece together evidence and form a deduction. I understand, she's concussed and stuff, it's a wonder she's thinking clearly, but still.* The detective keeps a deduction wall in the hotel room - even after someone has obviously broken and mucked with stuff. I know, she's concussed, fine.* Crappy instructions on the puzzles that weren't immediately obvious. They stay the same quality for the entire series.* There's one puzzle I didn't get at all - it was one of those ""guess the hidden password based on nothing."" In later games, the herione will staunchly refuse to muck with stuff until she has an idea of what combination or password she needs. I don't know if I missed a hint or what, but that puzzle made no sense to me.A lot of my problems with the game can be explained away with the detective's concussion, so overall I really enjoyed the game. Good puzzles, good hidden object scenes, and a story that manages to keep interest."

I love this game so much that I couldn't wait to get the other two-I kept telling myself I'd wait until a sale, but I didn't hold out for more than a week. It's definitely not a series you can just play the first part of. It's too addictive even if the ending of the third game was a little predictable. Also the surprise twist in the second-but I don't think being obvious hurts the game. But the puzzles aren't too hard, the hint button is handy, and I believe if I remember correctly, on easy it doesn't punish you for clicking all over the place. Just be warned that if you play this first part, odds are you will become addicted and need to play the other two. It was that good, for me. I really enjoyed the voice acting of the woman. I liked that the graphics were too grainy (or at all) when the cut scenes happen, and they were basically perfect through game play.

You have to manually retrace steps when you go to a different location which if that involves more than three steps (which is does a lot) you find yourself just skipping through lots of areas and it takes time.The other issue is that the HOG are not the most helpful, in several there are more than one item that looks like the one you are searching for, or that the game is asking you to look for a cylinder and it's a hat. I was not impressed with that.However having played it through and then started on the bonus chapter (which is pretty quick) I would say yes.

For the oldest of the set (five years old now), this game held up really well, and was a fun and engaging hidden object game that I can recommend wholeheartedly to fans of the genre.It does have a few rough edges. Artifex's nagivation system has improved a lot since this game, especially the ability to navigate using the map. This game has a *lot* of walking around from location to location. Also, they did a slightly poor job of making sure that when you're asked to find something, there's only one of it in the scene. (A good example is a scene full of skulls that asks you to find a jawbone. There are at least ten on screen, but it's a specific one that it's looking for.) Also, there are some odd translation and/or word usage errors. For example, the game uses ""shoe"" interchangeably for shoes and boots. That wouldn't be so bad except that sometimes there are both shoes and boots on the screen. In that case, ""shoe"" always refers to the boot, not the shoe. Despite all of that, though, it's a really fun game.I wish I could say the same for the bonus adventure. It's short.... that's about what it's got going for it. The translation issues abound -- keep your phone or a web browser handy to look up words that aren't in use anymore and then be prepared to figure out what kindasorta but not exactly matches that word anyway. There's a lot of pointless reuse, some depending on you to see things in locations you've visited several times that are next to impossible to see, and just generally a lot less cohesive of a story. Also, the voice acting is terrible.That said, if you finish Enigmatis, you'll probably want to play it, and it doesn't take all that long. I just wouldn't pay extra to get access to that bonus adventure part if I were being asked to."

Some of the items on the hidden objects screens were hard to see.  But, I did like how the map showed you where actions were available.  Graphics were good.  I would recommend, especially if it is on sale."

I recommend this game if you are into solving puzzles and love suspense.  I'm not going to lie, I was a bit creeped out playing this game in the dark, with that suspenseful music playing in the background.  Only negative thing I can say is that it was over too quickly."

Missing girls, murder and immortal blabla.The way how plot goes is just stiff and baffling.I do like the ideal of evidence board, and I am curious about how this gonna end. But it won't change the fact that storyline of this game is kinda sh**ty.Well, I shouldn't be so harsh, after all this is just the first game.I bought all Enigmatis series, and I hope the voice actors can do their best."

Or, they would just use a vague word for what they were looking for, like ""Cutter"" or ""Luck."" I actually had to use the hint button a few times in this one because of it. Ran this on my Ubuntu 17.04 machine and it ran flawless."

However, some hidden object scenes have multiple objects that appear to fit what you're looking when only certain ones actually count (two clocks in a scene, only one is selectable), one puzzle bugged and somehow let me skip it, and I had to play the game twice when my first playthrough was mysteriously deleted."

It has a solid story, good mechanics and was fun to play. Maybe the story is a little bit weird, but for a HOG its pretty solid. Can honestly recommend even to newbies of the genre."
