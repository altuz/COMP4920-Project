Artifex Mundi keeps upping the game and brings another succeeding HOG in. Compared to the first game,The Siren's Callcarries a faster pace in story with just as good puzzles and HOG scenes. In this game, we'll have less undead, more... fishmen?The museum curator Sarah Black's adventures in the Caribbean continues. After her remarkable encounter with Captain Remington, Sarah is safely back and prepares for a new exhibition while trying to promote a ""fiction"" novel about her last encounter with Captain Remington. It is the middle of the night when a strange courier visits the museum to deliver a package. With the content of the package revealed, Sarah suddenly becomes a target again and a central figure in an old curse that slowly transforms the inhabitants of Kingsmouth to fishmen. You are to become a part of the resistance against a corrupt mayor, free a siren and challenge the curse of Davy Jones himself yet again.Catchy, huh? Yeah, I know. Some might think thatNightmares from the Deepseries are basically a retelling ofPirates of the Caribbeanmovies. Even I thought so when I finished the first game. This one, obviously gathers anecdotes fromDead Man's ChestandOn Stranger Tides, but still manages to harbor the Caribbean lore into something curious and genuine. The bonus chapter at the end of the game even presents some foreshadowing about the last instalment, namely the origin of infamous Davy Jones himself. I really expect something a bit different than the movie version Davy Jones. Here's hoping!I'll just skip praising the quality of artwork in Artifex Mundi games and define with two words: plain gorgeous. It is no big news that Artifex Mundi redefined the HOG genre, especially with the quality of artworks. This one is no different. Aside lovely background visuals with strong nautical themes, character animations are really good in this one compared to the first instalment. Characters have distinct facial remarks and body language. Cinematics seem to improve quite a bit too.The gameplay? As a HOG, it is more than decent with presenting different type of HOG scenes, one or two FROG scenes and some puzzle dynamics even in HOG scenes themselves. Puzzles are mostly ordinary with lovely artworks this time. You'd go through the most challenging one within 3-4 minutes. If you are bored with HOG gameplay, you may give Mahjong alternative gameplay a try anytime you wish. To grab all achievements, you'll be needing at least two playthroughs though: one for HOG achievements, one for Mahjong achievements. The map is interactive with ""available action"" indicators so backtracking is not an issue. We are already familiar with collecting coins and poking a - this time fish-dwarf to tell us the background story. I'm getting used to these guys. Sure they are creepy as ♥♥♥♥, but hey! They are company.Nightmares from the Deep 2: The Siren's Callis a good addition to the series, building up the concept further and establishing a bridge between the first and the last game, and a neat HOG by itself.

Some of the puzzles aren't overly difficult, but then again, for a genre where you have to knock the moustache off the Washington monument with a /broom/, not the /bamboo stick/, because that's for the giant panda three levels from now...Still, don't let the 'hidden object game' fool you; this is little like the old I Spy games from yesteryear.  This is a proper point-and-click adventure game geared towards a more grown up audience, with intriguing plot, interesting puzzles, and a couple nice bonus achievements for the eagle-eyed completionists out there.  Hell, it opens with a kraken crushing a ship as a sailor watches in terror.If you've been missing point-and-click adventure games, now's your chance to find them again."

This time around you embark on an adventure to save a siren and to lift a curse cast upon Kingsmouth that makes its inhabitants gradually transform into aquatic creatures.Although the story is connected to the first game from the series, you don’t need to have played The Cursed Heart to enjoy The Siren’s Call because this game serves very well as a stand-alone game. However, if you find yourself enjoying either of them, I highly recommend you play the entire series, concluding withNightmares from the Deep:  Davy Jones.The exciting plot, the fun gameplay, the lovely concept art, the mysterious atmosphere, the ambiance and music closely follow the style of the first game and are up to the standards that Artifex Mundi got us used to. In addition to what you expect of a high-quality Artifex Mundi game, this game offers a lot of interactive moments (for example the scene in which you have to extinguish a fire), clever plot twists and turns, smooth animations and slow-motion shots. All of these combined make for immersive gameplay and deliver a very pleasant gaming experience.More reviews on theLilly's Corner Curator page"

You play as the same museum curator from the first game, but this time you are taken to a cursed island to continue your quest.The story is simply great, tying in both to the previous games' Davy Jones myth as well as legends of sirens and will keep you wanting to play to the end.The world is beautifully decorated so you will actually want to inspect each scene even if it isn't a hidden object puzzle and the voice acting and music are a huge step up.Hidden Object puzzles are somewhat difficult but never needlessly so, and if you do get stuck there is the hint button. You can also skip the HO puzzles and play a mahjong puzzle instead.The bonus adventure unlocked after completing the game is less well fleshed out, with too few locations and a lot of back tracking between them, but I still recommend playing it since it leads up directly to the final game in this trilogy."

You play a female museum curator who gets kidnapped to a cursed island by a man in desperate need to save his love.The main game is a point & click adventure, but combined with 3 types of sub-games. First there are puzzles, which are usually not too difficult to solve. Second there are the hidden object games, where you need to find a list of objects in a single scene. And third, mahjong, the Chinese tile game.I found the game addictive as you quickly pass puzzle by puzzle and the story line opens up.

However, a stranger with a mysterious package shows up one evening, triggering a fight between fishmen and him.

A mermaid is captive and your friend wants to save her as he's in love with her. The only person that can correct everything is you....While the plot is great, I've been less impressed by it, maybe because the enemy is now someone really greedy and without anything to redeem.The gameplay stays the same: point-&-click, puzzles and hidden objects. Compared to the first game, nothing changed really apart now a search for different objects that are sometimes hard to spot (which is the weakest point of the game). As usual, the difficulty is well-balanced. And the bonus chapter is showing the aftermath of your actions.The graphics are still beautiful, while you're still on an island, now, you're visiting a village, with its sewers, lighthouse, tavern or markets. People you're meeting aren't necessarily hostile to you, as they're also wishing for peace. As usual, Davy Jones is mentionned. Besides, the ambiance is still a surreal one. The soundtrack stays also good.It is a great sequel anyway. While the game isn't innovative, it's still an agreable moment you will pass, so, don't hesitate too for that one."

With Part 2 this game is one of the few HIdden Object Games worthy of being a franchise with its excellent story telling, great imagry, and fun puzzle solving gameplay elements.  Once again you are the Museum Curator who like most museum curators must battle the forces of the supernatural to maintain your exhibitions.Anyone can enjoy this game, the difficulty level seems fine for all kinds of players from new HO fans to battle hardened HO veterans.  There is a strategy guide if stuck, hint button if lost, and hint button for puzzles.  The gameplay is up to the player since this unique series of games offers Mahjong as an alternative to finding the hidden objects.  All of the scenes fit the atmosphere of the game with a nautical or seaside type of theme fun for summer gaming.  This game continues the pirate traditionss of Voodoo, Mermaids, or to be Politically correct Mer-people which is their official designation.A trademark of HO games is their fantastic artwork, the scenes and characters come to life fully voiced.  Though their pronunciation of some words can be a bit controversial sparking debates and barhouse brawls across the Caribbean for centuries.Kraken in the game is pronounced Crack-In which is how its pronounced in Scandanavian, while the creature is known earliest amongst the people of Norway where it seems they call it Kraw-kun?  In English using phonetics Kraken would be pronounced Kray-ken.  Scholars to this day and possible scientists deep in Area-51 are still trying to unravel this mystery to unlock the riddle of the ages.The best answer seems to come from Pirates of the Carribean:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXKoWLSyxz4*Competionist TIps:When looking for the Mirage parrots, keep track of locations where the mirage parrots have been found.  Watch in cut scenes for them to appear indicating their presence in a scene.  If one is known to be in a location keep going back and forth to trigger the mirage parrot to appear.  While this is the most difficult part of the game, its not too hard, the games short length makes it not so bad to get 100% in for even the fastest of achevo hunters.Rating:  10/10  Vaule:  $9.99"

Once again, the similarities between thePirates of the Caribbeanfranchise and this game series abound. The beginning also made me think a little bit of Indiana Jones.Artifex Mundi certainly likes the Damsel in Distress trope as a motivator – third game I played from them, and third damsel in distress to rescue in the main adventure. One thing I like about Artifex Mundi’s games is that most of the puzzles have a trick or clue that you can use to solve the puzzle rather than relying on trial and error. Even when trial and error is required, there’s usually a way to track your progress towards the solution so that you don’t get frustrated.The end of the bonus adventure sets up for the third game, which is available on Steam now.One more museum professional pride quote from the game: “You’re quite resourceful!

The cutscenes were not blurry at all, and the puzzles were a lot more challanging. I also like being able to move from place to place by a click on the map. There were a couple frustrating things, like trying to find the silver parrot and sea horses, but nothing that would turn me away from recommending the game to others. It is a very nice casual game to get out of the norm of other genres and one of my favorites to get into. I look forward to playing the third one of this collection now."

While the animations etc are technically simplistic. The package comes off with an enjoyable execution that feels higher standard than you would expect. If you are looking for a decent and very casual point and click game with a story. This is a good choice. Just be forwarned that the structure of all these games are pretty similar so I would recommend playing one that has the theme you like. Secondly, this series with ""Nightmare"" etc are mainly focused at females. So you, if your a guy that is, might feel you are taking a bit of a ""backseat"" on stuff you would usually do in other games, being ""the Man"" and all, I mean. :D"

The colourful places have something that really appeals to me.The map allows for jumping between scenes, no tedious walking through a row of locations to get from one to another.The puzzles and the alternative to the hidden object games are fun.It's a shame that the achievements for all hidden object/all mahjongg games can't be done via the extras, and needs a 2nd play through.

If you've played any of Artifex Mundi's other HOGs, you pretty much know what to expect:  good graphics, interesting little story, acceptable voice acting, and good HOG puzzles.  There were two things I don't much care for in this game, though.  The first is the octopi, seahorses, and parrots we have to find in the game.  They're just sitting around in the environment and you have to click on them.  The octopi aren't too bad since they're alway present.  But, the seahorses only appear when you interact with the correct scene element, and the parrots phase in and out on a timer.  It's not a hard quest, but it's a bit irritating.  My second gripe is that in order to get all the Achievments, you MUST play through the game twice.  And, if you mess up, you might have to play through it even again (since there's no saving -- only your current game state).  But, neither of those things is worth marking the game down.  I got about 8 hours of play on my first run-through.  Then andother 1.5 hours on the Bonus chapter.  And then another 3 hours to run through most of it a second time to complete the Achievement.  So, even at it's full list price, the game is worth it.  Of course, look for it on sale.  Recommended."

Traditional hidden object screens (clearly denoted by sparkles on the easier difficulties), and FROG (fragmented object) puzzles.  These HOGs and FROGs were well-constructed with clean art and a satisfying level of difficulty.2. Bonus game-wide ""I-spy"" style challenges including octopi (concealed within level backgrounds), seahorses (exposed by certain hand icon actions), and owls (disappearing, reappearing background images).  The seahorses and octopi were fairly simple to find once you knew what you were looking for, but waiting around for the owls to appear was a bit tedious at times.  Additionally, unlike AM's more recent titles with this kind of bonus content, there is no on-screen indicator to let you know if you missed one of these objects on a particular screen.3. An assortment of brainteaser mini-games like tile-swapping, rotating discs, jigsaws, matching, and spot-the-difference puzzles.  There were a handful of new surprises and unique challenges; however, many of the puzzles were what I have come to see as trademark mini-games for this studio (""arrange the books,"" ""plug in the four cables,"" ""place all the gears,"" ""rotate the discs,"" etc).  Although, they made the effort to give each of the old standbys a fresh nautical-themed spin, with completely new art.4. Recipes. (It wouldn't be an Artifex Mundi game without them.)5. Typical adventure gaming object-based challenges.  The game does a good job of letting you know what objects you should be looking for, and it gives you constructive feedback if you try to use the wrong item solution.As for other aspects of the game:- The art and backgrounds are well done, with the best character models I have seen from this studio.- The voice acting is decent.- The music is dramatic and appropriately action-y, although slightly generic.- The story is coherent, interesting, and has a proper ending.  It directly follows the first game, and feels like a natural continuation of the narrative.  It was a bit of an overkill, though, to have the story expressed through dialogue, and cutscenes, and the scattered writings of various characters, and then rehashed all over again with the dwarf's cinematic flashbacks.  There was a lot of duplication of information.- The map completely eliminates tedious backtracking by letting you click on any location to instantly teleport there.  (I could seriously hug this map).  This applies to all difficulty settings.Overall, I would give this title an 8.5/10."

Puzzles / hidden object scenes are good. There are bonus effects like when you click in a certain place, the birds there will fly away, and there are also bonus trophies youcanfind but don't have to.Production-value-wise this is the best HO game I've played so far (and I've played like 10, didn't play part 1 of this one yet). Not sure about the voice acting: At least the siren's actress is phoning in a mindless job, isn't speaking like someone who means what they are saying.

,Not Recommended,284790,20534368,"Posted: 14 January, 2016",all,TopazMystique,"This was a tough call. I enjoy the game to a certain extent. However, the cons for me were:1. Four achievements are dependent on playing all the hidden object scenes as mahjong instead. I don't buy hidden object games to play mahjong instead. If it had been match 3, I might have ignored this but I absolutely hate mahjong and these are LONG mahjongs. So, if you want these achievements, you will need to play the game at least twice and if you accidentally play a hidden object instead of mahjong, it will be more than twice! After wasting 2-1/2 hours playing through the second time trying to get these achievements, I gave up and decided it was not worth my time.2. There are way too many cuts scenes. Even though they can be skipped, I hate to do that when playing the game for the first time because I might miss something. My feeling is that if I wanted to see a movie, I would go to the theatre!3. Voice acting was on the poor side. In most cases, emotions were either incorrect or missing from the spoken dialog which made it sound cheesy.4. The ""strategy guide"" is intergrated into the game... mostly. However, there is no indication that I could find for the collectibles in the game. So if you want the achievements for that, you will have to look elsewhere for help in finding the 19 octupi, 18 parrots and 7 seahorses.5. Artifex Mundi games on Steam do not keep game progress from previous plays so if the game was previously completed, on Steam it is mandatory to replay the game just to be able to play the bonus level. Other games keep game progress so the base game does not need to be replayed on Steam."

As a recently converted Artifex Mundi games acolyte I must say that this game made me really impressed. I played the older games from this publisher and they were typical fast, one-time casual games. This one aspires to be something more. A pleasant adventure with a good, heroic story. Really beautiful scenes (even comparing to the previous still good part 1) and even 3-D elements with characters making the game more realistic. Great sound and music at top level.It is a hidden object game so let's check that. Quite a number of HOS well drawn (still I would like to see a bit more clutter to be more challenging), interesting twist with assembling objects from parts - that was fun. Logical puzzles and riddles sometimes seemed repetitive (comparing to previous titles) but still well made and based mostly on perception. Since it is a casual type of game, it strikes a nice balance between fun gameplay and a challenge (BUT should be played on Expert mode from the beginning). Adding extra achievements about finding extra items hidden throughout the game was a very good idea that prolongs the fun.I really recommend that game and wait for more from Artefix Mundi :-)"

Since it's a trilogy they could have found a more suitable voice actress for the main person I feel. Or maybe I just don't like her American accent.* Story could have been even better, but then it can in most Artifex Mundi games.

This time she is contacted for her previous experience with Davy Jones and adventure happens as she travels to a cursed island to help a young man and his mermaid girlfriend.In this game I did encounter a gamebreaking bug that involved the character handing me an item and I assumed my character got it in the inventory when it was in fact in his hand for me to pick up. Moving on with the story moves this character to another place on the map and this time no item and I can't go back for it and cannor progress in any way. I did email Artifex Mundi about the bug and they said they're fixing it. Meanwhile; pick up everything or get stuck!I liked this game a lot, enough for me to play it though an extra time after buggin out in my 2nd playthrough, The art and music is very nice and fits with the theme of them game. The story is decent and well-told. The puzzles and hidden object scenes are all good and I had no particular problems with any puzzles. A few are so easy that some random clicks will get you there, but mostly the puzzles do take some thinking.The game also has achievements for collecting all the collectibles, some of them only showing for a few seconds on the map for so to disappear for a few seconds. These collections are nice, but if you're going for completion, be aware that after a certain point in the game, you cannot go back to collect more as areas will be closed off. Luckily if you mess up on your first go around you can continue the same collection on a 2nd playthrough if you're on the same profile (as people who play through twice for the achievements anyway are the people who will want the collection complete achievement too).The games comes in 3 difficulties and the differences are the amount of sparkle of useful items and the recharge of the hint button. The map shows available action on the map on the lower diffiulties and in the hardest mode is only used for teleporting. All cutscenes and conversations are skippable (which is nice for a 2nd playthrough as there are a lot of them) and usage of the hint button outside of the puzzles will not effect any achievements.Overall a very good HOG, the story is solid and interesting and the art is beautiful. The music sets a good atmosphere and the animations are decent."

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.That's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.They do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.My recommendation, because of the ""if you've played one you've played them all"" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games."

This one is an improvement on every level except possibly the voice-overs (which haven't gotten worse, but which i'll characterize as ""average - not bad, certainly acceptable""). Most notably, the quality of the cinematic scenes is improved about 50x over its predecessor, and they are (still) used to good effect in transitioning between scenes.i'm _not_ a point-and-click adventure lover, nor a lover of puzzles, but at 8 Euros for the 3-part series i felt compelled to try this out (based on the positive reviews) and have not been disappointed. Each episose is short (under 6 hours for part 1, and i read that part 2 is under 4 [edit: i must be slow, because i needed just over 5 hours for the main story and had to ask the internet about one of the puzzles because i ""just didn't get it""]), and couldn't normally justify paying the full asking price, but on sale it was certainly a reasonable deal.Fantastic graphics, trivial controls, some improved/more advanced gimmickry in the puzzles (compared to part 1), and a lovely soundtrack make this a great casual game for the non-hard-core PaC/HOG players.Post-finish notes:- Just over 6 hours, including the bonus mini-adventure after the main storyline.- fantastic graphics and mixing of cinematics with still scenes.- the ""bonus"" hidden items (Parrots, Octopi, and Seahorses) are a nice touch, except that the Parrots come and go over time - they literally fade in and out of view within a scene (very subtly), so it's difficult to spot them and they might literally not be visible while you're looking for them. i manged to get all the Octopi, but not the others.- the protagonist is a spoiled brat: she refuses to smear jam on bread with her own fingers, and demands silverware for that purpose.
