,Recommended,284810,20502332,"Posted: 13 January, 2016",all,Faudraline,"As we approach the last act of theNightmares from the Deepseries, we are yet to learn the origin of notorious Davy Jones. So far, so good. But with this final act of the trilogy, I'm happy to declare that we are in for a little more than aPirates of the Caribbeanrip-off; an appropriate interpretation that will shed some light to a more fairytale version of the old tall tale.After challenging the verdict of the infamous sea devil more than once, Sarah Black is in for a little visit from the man himself! During a seminar that she organized to tell the world of the secrets of Davy Jones, the party gets crashed and Sarah gets abducted alongside with her daughter. Davy agrees to spare Sarah by making her daughter sign a contract for her to work as a servant in Davy Jones' island forever. As resourceful and persistent as she is, Sarah takes the quest of rescuing her daughter by breaking all deals that the sea devil holds: once and for all.As I declared beforehand, the concept of Davy Jones is interpreted as a fairytale, with nuances fitting for a European folktale rather than an eerie Caribbean mystery - which was a welcoming surprise coming from the developer team. Side characters as accursed pirate lords of the old, the eerie sea witch with her own agenda and the ghost of the young, innocent girl trapped in the island vivified the rather dark tone and established the baseline for all Artifex Mundi games: stories of magic and mystery; harbored with imagination rather than grotesque fear, fitting for a HOG adventure.Here in this tale, we are in for a visual feast: the best and most glamorous artwork the series had to offer so far with shining lights, growing shadows, brilliant colors and otherworldly designs. Both dialogues and the voice acting a pretty well developed, evolving with each new game also. Artifex Mundi seems to topple down its own limits with the application and elaboration put into this one.As always, a ton of HOG scenes - with fairly different variations - , a collection of imaginative puzzles and a hunt for a handful of collectible items await us in this adventure. The alternating Mahjong gameplay, the interactive map and a bonus chapter at the end comes gift wrapped. You are in for a rather long game; I'd give at least 5-6 hours for the first playthrough, and maybe 2 hours for the second if you are an achievement hunter. One little minus - for me, at least - was that the chest guarding creepy dwarves that we encountered in former games were nowhere to be seen, aside an old one who'd give us a quest item and exhaust his use quite fast! Hey, I was getting akin to those guys! But no worries, here we have - maybe creepier stone guardians who hold the fragments of memories belonged to Davy Jones to present us insight about the background of all affairs.Without the need to belabor further, here is the last part of a pretty great series and a well above average HOG by its own self. Pick it on sale and enjoy with its previous installations.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

Either way, you won't be disappointed. Artifex Mundi gives us some of the best Hidden Object games and now we can add Nightmares from the Deep: Davy Jones to that list. Fun story, nice graphics, bonus things to look for (Glowing Seahorses, Pirate Cards, etc.), puzzles are perfect (not too easy and not too hard), very enjoyable HO scenes, and a few things that'll make you laugh. Music is the same as the first two games, piratey and hauntingly beautiful. Add in cards and achievements and you've got everything you could want! The story continues the plot of the first two Nightmares from the Deep so, if you enjoyed those games, this is a must buy. Even if you haven't played those, if you're an HO fan, this is sure to please.  :)"

The story is told through fully animated and high quality cutscenes and the environments you go through are beautifully detailed, with moving branches etc. to make them feel alive.The Hidden Object puzzles are randomized so even a second playthrough will keep you challenged, but you can skip them and play a simpler mahjong puzzle instead.The good animation is supported by quality voice acting, and it all comes together in a satisfying conclusion. I can definitely recommend this."

Like maybe you like eating at McDonalds, or jacking it to videos of Swedish weightlifters.  That's the way I feel about Artifex Mundi games.  I have them all, I've finished them all, but as much as I like them, I feel like I should be playing somehting more substantial.  Somehow I just like the calmness of it all.  The bland, monotone female protagonist, the puzzles that pretty much repeat from game to game, it's a simple, familiar formula, and it's comfortable.I can't really complain, I've gotten many hours of gameplay out of these point and click games featureing the same woman who for whatever reason cannot stop losing her daughter to various demons and ghosts that seem intent on kidnapping her.  Personally, if I was this ladies daughter, every time she wanted to go on a trip, I'd be like ""Um, no thanks, but I've been kidnapped by demon ghosts the last five trips, I think I'll sit this one out.""Overall, I really have a good time, or at least a relaxing time, playing these games, as the puzzles are not really challenging, and the scenes are well done.  If you are looking for a game that won't stress you out, or are someone who values bland voice acting, I would suggest that you try pretty much any Artifex Mundi game."

More so than their previous efforts, Davy Jones has an intriguing sense of personality and strong cinematic style that make it feel more like a big-budget title than an indie game. Artifex Mundi's detailed artwork has also gone from modestly attractive to drop-dead gorgeous; I think Davy Jones is one of the best looking games I've seen from the past couple of years.On the negative side, I still find the relatively linear, inflexible puzzle design to be irksome. There could be a lot more replay value if the game were designed with multiple puzzle solutions and different paths to take. More length would have also been nice, to make the game feel more epic and give the writers the opportunity to tell a more complex story. Still, the 5-6 hour, $10 game standard has its own appeal, and could be part of the reason why Artifex Mundi has been so successful.It may be the third game in its series, but Davy Jones stands alone, and is one of the best places to start if you're curious to experience a hidden-object adventure game for the first time. I'm already looking forward to the next time I dive in and rediscover all of Davy Jones' secrets.(Rating: 7.5/10 “Good”)"

,Recommended,284810,30536577,Posted: 15 March,all,krayzkrok,"Whenever I finish a Hidden Object Game, I wonder whether I should review it. I mean, it's a HOG, right? We know how these things work, don't we? You typically expect a cliched story, some dodgy voice acting, and yet that strangely chilled out mix of adventure, puzzle and hidden object shenanigans. But hey, I really enjoyed this one, so you get a hear about it.I'd say this is probably the best HOG game I've played. I wouldn't put this (or in fact any HOG) into any kind of classic game category, steady on! But still, as these things go, this was a good one. The story isn't quite as one-dimensional as it first appears, the voice acting is probably the best I've heard in a HOG (this isn't saying much, admittedly, but it's far less cringe-worthy than most), and the rest of the game is well put together. There's the usual ridiculousness of having to find a dozen misplaced doodads in order to open a simple door, but that's part of the appeal! In fact, it's modestly challenging in places, but never enough to stump you. Some of the hidden object scenes are quite difficult (cleverly hidden, rather than pixel hunting), some of the other puzzles are moderately inventive, and the game isn't over in three hours like some of them. Amazingly, the bonus chapter doesn't feel like it was put together by the intern, and is actually a) quite long and b) the same quality as the rest of the game.If you've never experienced the strange appeal of these games, I'd say this was a pretty good jumping off (or in) point. They are very frequently on sale or in bundles, so keep your eyes peeled."

However, after having managed to undo pacts with Davy Jones, the mighty pirate wants his revenge. And when her daugher, to save her, signs a pact with the devil, Sarah is again embarked in an adventure to save her child but this time, in Davy Jones's own lair. What she will discover will make her understand that maybe, Davy isn't so evil that she thinks...The plot is again well constructed and is better than the prequels, though again, Sarah's daughter is in distress for the second time. And as in the first game, your enemy is only someone suffering from a broken heart, making him likeable.Anyway, I found this game a little longer than the others but without any real changes from the previous ones. The gameplay is still find items, solve puzzles and hidden objects games. And the difficulty is also well balancedAs usual, the graphics are still beautiful, though now, it's a mix of the first game (ship) and the second game (village). The surreal ambiance is still present: talking skeletons for example. Now, the items you have to find for achievements are easier to spot than in the second game. The soundtrack is still agreable to hear.The game concludes well the trilogy as you're finally uncursing Davy Jones. As usual, Artifex Mundi delivered a great game, that must be in the library of every HO lover but also any player interested by trying this genre! Don't hesitate!"
,Recommended,284810,14606781,"Posted: 22 February, 2015",all,ElleWolfe,"I had a coupon for this so figured I'd give it a go even though I'm not too keen on hidden object games... and I never played any of the other games in the series (turns out that doesnt matter, they are unrelated series). I was pleasently surprised by the game, and played the entire main game and then the bonus one in a little over 7 hours...straight. It is quite addictive, and this game gives the hidden objects genre a breath of fresh air. It's rich in plot, mystery, and intrigue.Okay, honestly at first... the narration... I was pretty convinced I had just bought a game for 7 year olds. I turned my volume down and continued onward. It tells you in the beginning to turn the sound up for a better gameplay experience and maybe it's just me, but I felt better just reading the captions.I played it through the entire time on the middle (advanced/intermediate?) setting, but there is the option for expert which offers it's own acheivement and does make the game harder with click penalities and turning off visual clues, etc. There is also a easy mode if you have kids or you are really really lazy.There's  the obligatory stereotypical find the hidden objects, but multiple types: the empty silhouette (figure out what object you must find from the shape), the list of words and then there is the interactive which is quite neat ( Here's a non-spoiler fake example:  say you need a hot cup of water, you would need to find a cup, a heat source, and water and combine them to acheive the result.) These puzzles also help you by giving you a useful item you may need on your quest. Also, strange but nice, is the option to play a round of mahjong instead of the hidden object search. (I think there's also an achievement for playing 3 rounds of mahjong.) It may sound weird, but it comes in handy when your raging for the last thing on your list and don't want to use a hint or skip the puzzle (which are also achievements).There are also tons of puzzles that involve logic skills and can take some time. Also, I found it quite interesting that you can travel between parts of the map freely once youve discovered them, and often need to go back and forth to complete objectives. That aspect really sets it apart and truly makes more of a point and click adventure first, hidden puzzle game second.Bottom line: worth 10 bucks? Probably not. Grab it with a coupon or when it's on sale, it's a great time killer and was unexpectedly fun. I'll buy more from the series when they're cheaper. It's 7 hours of my life I won't get back, but sometimes that's better than just watching TV, and it's totally worth a thumbs up."

I like the Nightmare from the Deep series a lot. I definitely enjoy the focus of a single player puzzle game because it takes your direct focus and challenges you on your own. Davy Jones games give you that pirate charm while doing so! If you've watched any of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, you will enjoy the focus on the Davy and his past. It's interesting to see it all revealed and learn more about the man."

It's definitely the best of the ""Nightmares from the Deep"" series, and that series is one of their best.  Just about everything in this casual adventure Hidden Object Game (HOG) is better than it is in earlier works:  graphics, voice acting, and story.  Best of all, we aren't forced into a second full playthrough to get 100% Achievements.  A single playthrough on Expert plus doing the first three HOGs as Majhong in a second partial playthrough can get us everything.  Yay!  My only complaints (and they're very minor) are that I hate the daughter (which has been true in all three games of the series) and they have too many Fractured Object Games (FROGs).  I defnitely prefer HOGs to FROGs.It took me 7.3 hours to get through the main story and an additional 1.9 hours for the Bonus chapter.  So, 9.2 hours of very good gameplay makes the game worth buying even at it's list price.  Of course, I bought it on sale :) ."

Since it's a trilogy theycould have found a more suitable voice actress for the main person I feel. Or maybe I just don't like her American accent.* The annoying daughter of the main character is back from the first story. Her voice is if possible even more annoying than in the first game.* Story could have been much better, but then it can in most Artifex Mundi games. It felt very cheesy and corny at times.The base of it is good, but the way it is told.. I suspect this game is aimed at women, and it's annoying that they thinkwomen like these types of stupid stories with weak and badly explained plots.* Some of the solutions to puzzles are really stupid and far fetched, like that you should be able to use a file to make ascupltured object out of a log, or that you can just bang on a big heap of large rocks with a mallet to crush them.. Maybeit's just me, I don't have a problem with that it's possible to craft revival potions or magical artifacts in the game, butmy understanding of the game is that certain magical elements exists, not that laws of physics totally don't apply :PComment: I played it on casual difficulty. I don't recommend this game. Could maybe be worth it if you can get it on sale and want closure because you played the other 2 games in the series, but imo it was the worst of them.

I'm not saying anymore, have fun in this third and last adventure :)And I'm not saying anything else. I'll leave the rest for you to find out.Really loved this trilogy, I recommend this game."

The thing that is not so amazing is the fact that the mouth doesn't move with what the character says and is really poor. However, when they walk away for instance it is so fluid. The puzzles are good and at times interesting."

Out of all three this one is my favorite HOG in the Nightmares series. In this HOG u will be learning secrets about the man that is behind everything Davey Jones himself.Everything was awesome about this HOG. The graphics are pretty, the music awesome, and the BG very nice. The VA wasn't the best. In particular Cory's VA was the one I didn't like. Thankfully Davey Jones VA I liked a lot:)Also there is a bonus story to play:) The bonus story like the second in the Nightmare series takes place at the end of the game.All in all u should not miss out in this amazing HOG. This was just a fun one to play and also clocked the longest for any HOG I've played so far."

I enjoyed the story and also how we learn more about Davy Jones and how he changed from a good man to a bad man and had the right ideas but was misguided in the end and trying to bring his daughter back. It is very enjoyable and have not played the second game yet so will be interestng to see how that game works. I got this game last year and was for $3.50 which was quite cheap and try and buy it on special as the full price may not be worth it. The bonus game was nice and enjoyed how the extra story has a new story and you can even choose the dialoluge in one section which was nice and hope people enjoy it.

(Without Linux support from the publisher, this review would not exist.)- Outstanding graphics, both in ""static"" scenes (which aren't all that static, actually) and cinematic cutscenes. The cutscene transitions transport us seamlessly between scenes, without the ""dissonance"" caused by low-quality video in part 1 of the series.- Improved voice acting, compared to parts 1 and 2. It's the same woman for the primary character, and they did a good job of casting Davey's voice.- As in early episodes, the ability to ""warp"" between places using the map makes backtracking a non-problem.- They finally revealed the daughter's name. i don't recall her ever actually getting a name in the first two episodes.- There's a cute little dog running around in some of the scenes.The bad:- This game might set the bar a bit too high, as far as HOGs go. i.e., i'm not sure i'll be able to like other HOGs much after this one, as they're likely to not be nearly as nice :/.- Collecting all achievements requires two play-throughs, and i'm highly unlikely to ever play any given HOG twice, no matter how much i like it (at least, not until i develop Alzheimers).- i find the standard price of 7-8 Euros for 6-hour HOGs to be a tick too high for today's market. i got this on sale with a bundle for the whole series, so i can't complain, but i would not have bought it at full price because HOGs are not a genre i can typically get into.- It's missing the ""sonar"" feature, which i relied upon heavily in episode 2 to find objects when the words are ambiguous or completely new to me. What _is_ a ""garden fork"" if it's not the same as a ""pitch fork"" (which it's apparently not).Let's add all that up...Yup, the positives outweigh the negatives by a large factor. i.e., thumbs up."

This game features a decent story, decent puzzles, nice, colorful graphics with gorgeous artwork, and an excellent soundtrack with music that ranges from ambient to reminiscent of 19th Century romanticism. You might want to play the medium difficulty, it holds your hand a bit too much on easy."

This one at least didn't ""force"" me to play through the entire game over again for the Majong puzzles. That's very good.So yeah. This is me saying this after playing dozens of games like these.I still would recommend the game obviously, and the series are nice, but I am gettingtired of the achievements and the always litterary same type of female protagonist."

I like the added attraction of finding the puzzle pieces, seahorses, and pirate cards. Some are fairly difficult to find. The puzzles range from easy to very hard, with the bacteria sorting puzzle being the most difficult, at least for me. The visuals and music are nice and the story is OK. Get it on sale for the best value.."

,Recommended,284810,34754939,Posted: 5 September,all,charlottedamsbo,I can highly recommend this game. I loved the bonus chapter as well.Now we are unfolding the real story about Davy Jones. If you haven't played te previos games - please do that. It all makes sense in the endIt is a game from a developer with high standards.All the puzzles shows an excellent level of variation and the story is – if you can apprehend from the fact that a dead pirate are terrorizing a whole community from the afterlife – amazingly nice. I promise you: All three games played in a row makes an amzing story.The voiceovers are better than most HOGs  - with some minor exceptions.Oh  and  DO NOT FORGET YO USE YOUR MAP. It is an important tool to go anywhere.
