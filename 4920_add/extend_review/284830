,Recommended,284830,12835726,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,Praxis-[CE],"If you like the Artifex Mundi style, then you'll probably like Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink. I have to admit, this developer has changed my opinion on hidden object games in general because their titles consistently manage to combine an engaging story with puzzles that are challenging but not taxing or tedious, quality artwork, and music and voice acting that suit the story well. Clockwork Tales delivers, and is probably one of my favorites in this genre.I really like the Steampunk aesthetic, personally, so I thought it worked nicely into the format of a hidden object game. The bad guys here are militaristic fanatics with suspiciously German-sounding accents, so it's pretty obvious what imagery they were trying to evoke, but (pseudo-)Nazis blend well with the Steampunk style.  I was amused by the effort to include a bit of a science/geology theme in some of the puzzles and in the story, and I also appreciated that (like several of the other AM games I have played) the protagonist of the story was female.Clockwork Tales is not terribly difficult or long, and the game probably lacks much replay value, It's still pretty entertaining and I enjoyed the few hours I spent playing. The achievements can be won in just a few hours of casual gameplay, so if that's your thing, then this is your game. It's also a family-friendly game as most of the puzzles aren't too difficult and the theme isn't very scary."
,Recommended,284830,9961453,"Posted: 28 April, 2014",all,Chudah,"I've played a handful of Artifex Mundi's hidden object games, and I think this may be my favorite one yet.  Based on a popular series of Polish children's books, Clockwork Tales is an imaginative, fun, curious and enjoyable title who's emphasis is more on casual adventure than hidden objects. Set in a steampunk version of the 1700's, you play Evangeline Glass, an intelligent young protégé to the brilliant Dr. Ink.  With the help of Ink's clockwork companion, Matthew the bird, you must save Hochwald and the doctor from the machinations of the evil Grand Engineer Barber.One of the things I enjoy most about hidden object games is the beautiful and imaginative artwork many have, and this game is no exception.  Everything, including the characters, have a hand-painted look which gives it a storybook-like quality. Even the characters share the art style, which looks so much better than the oddly rendered/animated 3D models in other games.The game play is your standard IHOG/HOPA, adventure game lite with hidden object scenes mixed in. I always play on Expert to give me a bit of challenge and lengthen my game play, but I found Clockwork Tales to be quite easy, even more so than most games in the genre. This isn't a horrible thing, but considering how much I enjoyed the world that was created, I wanted to spend a lot more time there than a mere 3 hours on the hardest difficulty. Even so, the adventure aspect was very fun with nothing jumping out as being crazy illogical, and the many puzzles were moderately challenging despite most being reused from previous games.  One nice touch was being able to utilize Matthew to collect out of reach items and perform certain tasks.  Most of these aren't too hard to figure out, but it's a nice bit of flavor added to a genre that is very ""cut and paste"" in most gameplay aspects.The hidden object scenes are very well done, nicely drawn items without too much clutter, and have a nice range of difficulty, but none of the items were what I would consider unfairly hidden.  Mixed in amongst your standard HOS's are a few FROGs (fragmented object scenes), adding a bit of variety to the gameplay. I noticed, however, that the regular HOS's tend to get more plentiful the further you progress through the game. This wasn't an issue for me as I really like them, but not everyone shares that sentiment.  For those who do not, the number of these scenes are quite low overall compared to other games.While the setting is one of the best parts of the game, the story in the beginning feels a little rushed and can be a bit confusing.  But once things get going and you move out of the village into the castle, the storytelling smooths out quite a bit.  There are no dark, disturbing themes here (unlike so many others in the genre), and the story isn't deep by any means, but that doesn't detract from it's enjoyability.  This is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone but makes a particularly good family game, especially for parents who are looking for less macabre fair to share with their kids.One of my biggest issues in previous games from this developer has been the voice acting, but Clockwork Tales is a vast improvement overall, especially with the main characters.  Now I'm not saying these are award winning performances, but they're not jarring nor do they sound out of place given the material, and they don't pull me out of the experience as they would in other games.  Funny enough, the one game in which I find the voice work to be pleasant enough is the one in which we get a toggle for the voiceovers.  The option is still appreciated and I hope we continue seeing it in the future.This is the Collector's Edition of the game and comes with the bonus chapter (a short prequel to the main story), replayable puzzles and hidden object scenes, wallpapers, soundtrack and collectible ""steambugs"" that are sprinkled throughout the game.  I'm usually not big on having to find additional hidden items in these types of games, but the steambugs were a treat.  Aside from their imaginative and adorable designs, they're generally not too hard to spot, although it may take you a couple of play throughs to find a few you missed.All in all, I enjoyed Clockwork Tales immensely and am only disappointed in it's short length.  But the little time that I spent in the game world was time I completely enjoyed.  I will definitely come back to this one again and again."

I wonder why I haven't played this earlier. I knew I was getting myself a satisfactory HOG when I bought this, but I had no idea that I'll be having this grand a deal in HOG genre!In a fictional steampunk version of 1700 Prussia, we take the role of Evangeline Glass; Dr. Ink's protégé and engineer extraordinaire. We hit the road to meet with the good doctor in Hochwald, part of Habsburg Monarchy at the time, on a letter that we receive from him earlier. Dr. Ink has been making a research on the alarmingly raising number of earthquakes that were dominating the area. He claims that he has proof that a corruption in local authority is responsible: General Engineer is abusing a dangerous machine to create these earthquakes and he should be stopped at once!At this point, we all know what kind of game that we should be expecting from Artifex Mundi: beautiful artwork, genuine animations, charming setting, and a curious story. Above all our common expectations,Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Inkcovers a narration and a period so dark, yet envelops it with fair music and an atmosphere straight out of fables. The marriage of Austrian culture with Enlightenment science gives birth to this amazing game. As a personal favorite, I couldn't avoid to mention the puzzle of Saints during the bonus chapter, which is a direct example of this marriage. Did I mention the artwork? I know I'm trying my chance, but even the achievements interface itself is an artwork, made of stain glass!Gameplay is ordinary, yet the adventure elements of assembling machines are fairly imaginative. There aren't many HOG scenes, rather FROG - fragmented object game - scenes dominating this particular game. There is little to no backtracking, and a full functioning map. Puzzles are the kind that we are used to by now. As a change, in this particular adventure, we have the luxury of utilizing Matthew, a mechanical crow that we send out to gather items out of our reach, which spices the gameplay a bit up. We are also entitled to enjoy a bonus chapter at the end, to experience Dr. Ink's short adventure before Evangeline's arrival. The game is pretty short, being 5 hours or so with the bonus chapter.Once I've completed the bonus chapter, I wholeheartedly wished there would be a series of Clockwork Tales games. I usually prefer downright fantasy or at least mythological elements in storylines, butClockwork Tales: Of Glass and Inkis an elegant exception that I'll let myself be enthusiastic about. As a side note, I'm in love with the steam machine crow named Matthew!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

The puzzles are easy and serve merely as a way to access the story (which is pretty good).  The puzzles are mostly fun, though as stated above they are easy, but some of the find missions (especially at one point towards the end) were a little frustrating, as the picture list at the bottom of the screen for what needs to be found is really too small (unless I missed a way to enlarge them).  The game is really short, although I have not completed the extra level that comes with the Collector's Edition, the main part lasted a few hours (I have to go back to find one steam-bug, there seems to be one in each illustrated background).  One thing I didn't like was the fact that you can not combine items, but rather must use them in the correct order at the right spot.  If you are looking for a fun little story in an interesting package you might enjoy this.  Also, it has three levels of difficulty (some penalize you for incorrect matches in the find part of the game), and a hint function that I can't comment on since I didn't use it."

There are a few manipulation puzzles and some hidden object puzzles, and they're all fairly small and well integrated into the storyline: for example, with the hidden objects, you are always looking for something (or parts to something) that you'll need to progress in the storyline. I especially liked the dollhouse puzzle: 4 puppets in a dollhouse are looking for pairs of objects, and once you find the objects, you see a small animation where the dolls actually use them - very satisfying.The storyline has voiceovers, the hints do not: I'd recommend the game for anyone age 6 and up if they can read or have someone who can help them if they get stuck (but with the hint system, that should hardly happen). Also, if you ever wanted your very own steambug collection or find the recipe for the Steam Horse drink (""I'd give up my helmet for a Steam Horse!""), this game might be for you.The included bonus prequel is about an hour, with the professor in the village using the bits that you could look at, but not use, in the main game.Some small gripes like light beams colliding instead of passing through each other or minor inaccuracies in the ""evil German"" grammar (the German subtitles are very well written!) do not detract from an overall experience that is well crafted, even if it doesn't reach the scope or the immersiveness of a ""big"" adventure likeMachinarium."

Unfortunately for her, he disappeared and Evangeline must face an enemy set to conquer the world!Clockwork Tales is for me perhaps one of the weakest games produced by Artifex Mundi. Yeah, true, the plot is enjoyable and I don't mind the steampunk world, rarely visited in HO. But it doesn't have the same magic that goes with the other titles.However, the gameplay is still the same: puzzles, hidden objects, etc.. Here, you'll have also a little companion, a mechanical bird, that can find stuff out of your reach. It's a nice addition.What I loved the most in the game is the soldier's design. I loved the uniform, maybe because it's kinda making me think to Darth Vader or the Combines. But what is also fresh in this game is that the city isn't a big steampunk town but a little village in a snowy mountain. Besides, you'll also visit a castle, so, it's maybe a steampunk world but you're not drowning in it.Anyway, as any AM's game, this one can be bought eyes closed. Given the number of times it has been in a bundle, I suggest you to wait for one of them if you don't really want to buy it at 8 bucks."

It is a little on the easy side so playing on the highest difficulty is best. The story is fine, but it is the polish that really worked for me. The music and graphics are solid and the hidden object puzzles are actually scenes that make sense instead of a random assortment of meaningless objects. That attention to detail is rare.In addition, the bonus content for the game is really added playtime. It is not just a rehash of the places and puzzles you have done before.Overall, a really good game in this genre."

All of the necessary elements are here: sweeping fantasy, maniac evildoers, pipes and leathers and conspicuous gearing, airships and monocles and florid facial hair, evil robots and mechanical tinkery.  What's missing is the kind of lucid, engrossing gameplay I like to see from Artifex Mundi. Instead, this game feels forced and vague.It's not bad. I just like my Artifex games to stand tall over the competition, and this one is more of a shoulder-to-shoulder proposition. I hit all of the achievements here in a single play-through, and didn't find much in the way of detail and nuance. The various mechanical insects to spot and collect are barely concealed at all, the hidden object scenes are pretty but blunt, and the mini-games are on the bland, simple side. The main challenges are pretty much announced as flat tasks - ""I need to paint this room blue before I'll be allowed to leave,"" that sort of thing. ""Where have I seen blue paint? Maybe I should make some."" I don't necessarily love game-stopping difficulty levels, but slipping too far in the other direction doesn't make for engaging play.Maybe I'm just burning out on the genre; certainly most HOGs are cast from similar molds, and perhaps I'm just overwhelmed by the constant selection of games right now.

(Wish there had been more of the latter, alas) I enjoyed this game- and there were bugs (hence the achievement ""Too Many Legs"", but they were all mechanical, so I will not complain). Matthew, you're mechanical bird helper, is adorable, and helps out in some silly, but altogether needed ways.The game is overall easy, and doesn't take long to complete, which may be a selling point to some. It has a fun story, and interesting characters- one of which sings ""Soft Kitty"" from The Big Bang Theory- huh? All in all, I definately recommend this game! My only gripe (and again, this is a game with robot creepy crawlies) is that at one point I had to throw a snowball at an innocent, bystanding owl. Not cool, Artifex, not cool. Other than that devastating act of wildlife abuse, I was delighted in the overall gameplay.Just another reason I will always trust in Artifex Mundi!

First off, Matthew is a sidekick of sorts, chilling out in your inventory and looking awesome, but he's very useful in retrieving items and spying for you where normally you might break your neck if you tried yourself. Matthew is just overall a cool feature, and I wish players got more chances to use him. If you're bored of the crow, there are also hidden robotic bugs in many of the scenes which you can collect for completionist status; a nice little extra challenge, though relatively easy to do. The epilogue chapter helps to add a little more story, gameplay and depth as well. A little more bang for your buck.Overall, the artwork and scenery in this game is gorgeous, and for once, the voice-acting actually adds to the game rather than takes away from it, even if a few lines are repetitive after asking for Matthews help.

It's almost as though the developer wanted to make their own ""Clockwork Man"" game, but gave you a robot bird helper instead of a man. At least it utilizes its Steampunk theme way better than that series did. The bird has some useful talents that are actually required to retrieve certain objects, providing a neat twist on the genre. It feels like the actual Hidden Object scenes are getting fewer and farther between in these games, and have an art style not quite up to par with the rest of the game's beautiful scenery, but at least the puzzle-solving aspect is fairly involved, even though many of them are similar to puzzles in other HOGs. Although it's only in the bonus chapter, the sewer cap puzzle in this game is lifted *directly* from Abyss - it's literally the same puzzle and screens. I'm not sure whether to take that as a moment of homage, or as a sign that the developers are starting to rest on their laurels too much.Oh, and there's a part that involves giving catnip to a cat.

The gameplay is often usually a few scenes and some random objects in a list.  There are exceptions however in this genre and I'm please to say Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink is one of these.

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.That's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.They do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.My recommendation, because of the ""if you've played one you've played them all"" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games."

This game is different from other similiar games in that it is heavy on the puzzles, light on the hidden object scenes, which could be a good or a bad thing depending on which you prefer. I also found it to be much easier and less complex than other HOGs I have played. If you are familiar with Artifex Mundi, you will also notice that some puzzles were taken directly from other games they've made (or perhaps the other way around...).Another issue, which I've found to be true with other such games, is that sometimes in the hidden object scenes, you will be directed to find, for example, a ""hook,"" and there will be like 5 hooks in the scene, and you just have to keep guessing until you find the one they are referring to. An annoying oversight on the part of the game makers.In general the artwork and voice acting are both above average, and the story is super basic but acceptable.

76561198036338106,Recommended,284830,13205470,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,smelliga,"I hesitate to call this a ""hidden object game"" in the traditional sense because the first real HOG screen doesn't appear until over halfway through the game.  They toss in a handful of FROG (fractured object) puzzles, and they give you a ""find a bug in each location"" challenge, but for the most part this is an extremely casual point and click adventure that happens to have a few hidden object puzzles contained in the mix of mini-games.  (This is not necessarily a bad thing, however I expected something a bit different after playing several of Artifex Mundi's other titles.)Speaking of the mini-games, I noticed at least three of them were directly copied from ""Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden.""  I understand that a company needs to meet deadlines, but ripping off your own past work to flesh out your current game is a pretty disappointing tactic.Due to the sparsity of HOG's, there was no alternate puzzle solution option for this game (such as dominoes or mahjong).  While this is a significantly more simplified level of gameplay than I have come to expect from this studio, it does allow the player to complete all of the achievements in one playthrough.  They also did not include any time challenges for this game.Aside from the puzzles, the adventure game elements were fairly intuitive, there wasn't too much backtracking, the story was decent enough, the art was good, the character designs and voice acting were well done, and there was even a bit of humour thrown into the dialogue.  I also liked the inclusion of an animal companion who doubles as a special use item (something that seems to be a bit of a trend with this studio's more recent titles).  However, the game is not entirely immersive, and many of the challenges feel like a means to an end, rather than a fun progression of the plot.Overall I would have to give this game a 6/10.   If you are expecting a HOG, you will be disappointed, but if you are just looking for a casual steampunk adventure game, it fits the bill well enough."

The puzzles were challenging but not too difficult, and the story was interesting (if a little far-fetched.) For instance,charging a battery with lightning? Leaving an airship with no pilot in the air during a storm? A machine that can both induce AND prevent earthquakes? Come on. But I'll forgive them those quirks because the game was genuinely fun. The bonus chapter was a nice addition as well - the ""saints"" all being great scientists was cool. This game changed my mind about this genre."

Similar puzzles to previous games with a few exceptions.  Graphics and objects as always seem polished, and even though the voice-acting still seems to be off it seems to have become slightly better than other games. Speech doesn't flow well, but I think their English voice actors are from countries where English is not the primary language...either that or they're continuing to get amateur actors.  Subtitles and descriptions still occasionally have typos.Overall, interesting setting and graphics, short game time, lack of replayability.  Worth a buy, but like the other HOGs, buy on sale."

There's a lot of stuff that simply isn't explained at all, you're just plopped into the middle of it with no real attempt at backstory or even logical explanations of stuff. The villain is a ridiculously shallow stereotype and there's no real character development.But, I still recommend it. Mostly because it's beautifully drawn, and while there are holes the atmosphere is immersive and enjoyable. With hidden object games like this, the visuals count for more than anything else in my view, and that's where the game succeeds best.There's a hard mode for people who are REALLY good at these things (I played through it before trying hard mode and still couldn't get through one of the puzzles) but also a nice and simple casual mode that lets you skip puzzles that just aren't your thing. I'm big into that being important in games like this where I hate being stuck because of one single puzzle.I liked the voice acting, it's not perfectly timed, but it wasn't awful.Pros+ Beautiful art+ Diverse puzzles+ Different level settings+ AtmosphericCons- Shallow story- Flat characters- Hard mode is ridiculous"

Great illustrations. Good story.

Clockwork Tales is a point-and-click puzzle game with a steam punk theme. The art is very beautiful, & there are lots of very fun puzzles. Only 2 of the puzzles were any challenge at all however, so if you are looking for brain-benders then you will be disappointed. The steampunk theme works great for this puzzle game, & because of this most of the puzzles felt very natural in their placement rather than shoe-horned in. There's a good balance of Hidden Object Puzzles along with the other puzzles.The music is also beautiful, but there are only 3 tracks and it gets VERY repetitive. The game wasn't really long enough for the repetitiveness to get on my nerves however, & the puzzle music track in particular is very pretty! The voice work was also very good.The only thing that was a disappointment really was the story. It is a fairly simple, linear plot with no character development. There was just enough of a story to connect the puzzles & I just didn't care about Glass or Ink at all really, so it's a good thing that the puzzles were so fun!Completing the Prologue and the main story took me 6.6 hours, but I wasn't in any rush & took my sweet time so you could probably run through it much faster if you actually focused lol. I bought this on sale at some point but I don't emember what I paid. Definitely was worth the buy for me though.I recommend this game for someone who likes fun, creative, casual puzzle games, appreciates lovely artwork, & digs the steampunk aesthetic. Since there are no adult themes or language, & the story is simple, with the puzzles being not too challenging, I would also recommend this game for kids. :)"
