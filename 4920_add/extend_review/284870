,Recommended,284870,21012237,"Posted: 6 February, 2016",all,Faudraline,"9 Clues: The Secret of Serpent Creekis another Artifex Mundi game – one of their early productions, working with a young developer team: Tap It Games. It is a decent HOG to keep you busy for 2-3 hours straight with a subtle taste for noire. It is not exceptional compared to the rest of Artifex Mundi collections, but it is refreshingly well-done for the HOG genre itself anyway.Our character, a lady private eye comes to the little town of Serpent Creek to investigate the disappearance of her journalist friend, Helen during Serpent Creek's famous Serpent Festival. We are quick to notice that there is an obscene amount of serpentine references going about the town; alongside mysterious disappearances, earthquakes and zombie-like citizens. The story gets more and more complicated between a moody hotel manager, a veteran sheriff, a suspicious British guest and a disturbingly oblivious mayor... What to do?While the character modelling is appealing in animation, the psychological portrayal and demeanor designs of characters especially take the cake on this one. They are definitely interesting and elegant enough to keep you interested with the story revelation. People look and act similar to cover arts for classical Nancy Drew books with an extra dose of eerie and suspicion about them. You keep second guessing about characters, tying them to any kind of dreadful business the moment you see them. I won't lie, the outcome is not extraordinary, yet the display is certainly worth your time. The background artwork is also pretty and comes strong on establishing atmospheres.The game contains some of the more imaginative puzzles that I've encountered within genre, alongside some entertaining lock picking puzzles. What I especially liked was investigation scenes where we are expected to pick up some clues around to deduce the recent happenings within the room. Hidden object scenes were ordinary if not a bit too easy. The usage of the map, action indicators and its teleportation feature are all present to bring you a relief for achievement hunting.All in all, the game is worth the money for a HOG gamer, or anyone looking for a time kill with both noire and mystical atmosphere. If it is on sale, even better.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

Arriving there, apparently, nothing seems wrong, apart perhaps that man in a flower shirt, Owen...As any Artifex Mundi, this game is of quality. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy it as I should. It was kinda hard to enter the story this time because I have immediately understood who was the culprit, contrary to Grim Legends for example.I had a problem with one of the HO scenes where, despite clicking on the right item, it wasn't being picked up. I don't know how I managed to get it past (clicking and clicking and finding finally the hitbox), yet, it was frustrating. I don't know if it had been solved or not as I uninstall the game once I got everything I wanted from it.But despite this, it's an Artifex Mundi game: well polished, well thought, good visuals, good soundtrack and with nice twists.Given the fact that I've played the game a long time ago, why the review now? Guess what will be released in a few days? 9 Clues 2! It seems a little more darker than the first 9 Clues, more psychological (yay!), so, it was time to put a review for the game :).Buy it anyway :)."

Those who have played these games often (even casually really) will find this one predictable quickly.  It's unfortunate because I've played several games by this publisher recently, and those were rather enjoyable.  Within the first five minutes I already knew who had done it.  The hidden object puzzles were not really hidden objects."
,Recommended,284870,11320895,"Posted: 19 July, 2014",all,Dite,"It's a decent game to play if you like hidden objects and puzzles. Being that it has a pretty specific storyline, it doesn't have much replayability--the only real difference seems to be that some of the hidden object minigames ask for different items (excluding the one item you need for the storyline), but since you do a lot of them twice, it ends up all being the same stuff.For example:Playthrough One - Find STORY ITEM 1, star, fish, and shovel. Later you go back and find the STORY ITEM 2, book, wrench, and ball.Playthrough Two - Find STORY ITEM 1, fish, ball, and wrench. Later you go back and find STORY ITEM 2, shovel, book, and star.I finished the game (completing the story + a second playthrough for the achievements I missed) in ~5hrs. It's enjoyable the first time (even if a pretty weird story). And, you may end up replaying it for any achievements you miss. I'd say look into the Trade thread and trade someone for a 50% off coupon if you don't already have it. I think it's worth $4."

However, if you are a fan of ''Nightmares of the Deep'' like me, you will be saddened by this one.The puzzle were too easy. I felt no challenge and I could almost tell which object I had to click on without looking at the list I had. Second, the story made absolutely no sense and felt sort of rushed. The characters have no background so you don't even know who they are to your character and why they're all in this city.--WARNING SPOILER FROM HERE!!!!--The ''bad guys'' are very predictable. No surprise at all at the ending that also left me really unsatisfied. What also got me frustrated is how, for example, you have to find a way to touch an electrified cable and you need gloves ; you don't even have to look around in the map, it's right next to the electrified cable !! What is the point of having a hidden object game when the objects are not even hidden?-- END OF SPOILER --I am really deceived and hope that I will not come across another one like this. If you still want to try this game, I recommend to wait until it goes on sale because it's not worth the full price."

The graphics are more cartoonish, but they still fit the film noir / 1950s detective theme. I like how the sound effects are tailored to the theme as well – in this case, an old-fashioned camera sound occurs when you click on things. The 9 clues mechanic which gives the game its name is fun even if the stories deduced are a little funny in an out there sort of way.The game is susceptible to those idiosyncrasies that sometimes occur in this type of game. For example, requiring you to open a pull-tab can with a knife. Also, as a museum professional – ack! Lol the treatment of artifacts. I also had a minor quibble with historical accuracy. Elvis Presley first started making music in 1953, so he certainly wasn't famous enough to be known as the King by the time this game takes place in September of that year.However, the ending leaves room for a sequel, and I purchased the sequel as soon as possible when it came out, so let that speak for itself. :)"

A few loose ends aren't tied up, but the story makes sense, the graphics are pretty, and the puzzles are sensible. A minor quibble: you can't skip past some of the animation scenes, something they fixed in the loose sequel to this game. The hidden object scenes in this are randomised, so there is some replayability.If you play the second game in this series, you'll find that some of the mini-games are similar, and one of the extras, finding the ? marks, is also the same. More jump scares in this one, if you're of a nervous disposition. Also, snakes. I liked the music; it was both subtle, and suitable.Pros:+ great voice acting, except the main character (in places).+ pretty environments.+ good mini-games.+ some replayability.+ map with notations.+ logical adventure sequences.+ extra gameplay (finding the ? marks).+ appropriate, unobtrusive music.+ Mr Breebo!+ achievements.+ trading cards.Cons:- some unresolved threads.- like, really unresolved.- the main character's voice.- can't skip some of the animations.Ephy Rating: 7/10Summary: 9 Clues is certainly worth picking up on sale. The gameplay is solid, the mini-games are sensible, the voice-acting is largely competent, and the graphics are pretty. The unresolved plot threads annoyed me (what is up with the zombie-like people in town?), but that was the most irritating thing. Not as good as their second game, so if you're given a choice, get 9 Clues 2. Unless you really like snakes.Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?"

The voice acting is pretty good too, though some of the characters do sound a bit flat. (Luckily there are skip buttons available for cutscenes so you can just read the subtitles and move on if you so desire) My only complaint--and it's more of a critcism--is that none of the hidden object scenes were anywhere near as challenging as they are in other Artifex Mundi games. (I'm thinking of Enigmatis specifically since it shares a lot of similar themes with Serpent Creek) While this can be good news if you're looking for something casual to relax with, if you want more of a challenge, you might have better luck finding it elsewhere.

The hardest part of the game was solving the lockpick puzzles in under a minute to get the achievement.The only other complaint I have is that I could not skip through some repetitive dialogue.  The first playthrough I listen to everything, but on the second playthrough I want to skip the parts I already know.

The HOG scenes all are well designed and play fine, the point and click sections all tend to make sense and flow naturally, and the characters you interact with are mostly done well, if somewhat cliche in parts.The puzzles show a reasonable variety, although they tend towards the easy side mostly, it is unlikely you will need to skip any. One thing to note is that some locations are only accessible at certain parts of the story and then get locked back out again for the rest of the game, so if you are trying to get the ? achievement you need to be sure you have checked everywhere before you move forward, or you may have to replay most of the game to get that last achievement (museum and library are the two I missed I think), and it isn't like these games have much replayability.Anyway overall, a good entry in the genre, maybe a bit too easy in places, but the somewhat above average story helps make up for that."

The detective mode she enters when she finds a scene is interesting and I haven't seen it used in this genre before and makes the game crossover into detective games like Sherlock. There is a collectible in the game and unless you are either very opservant or using a guide it might take more than one playthrough to find them all as some areas are locked off as the story progresses.All in all a good game for fans of mystery games and/or HOGs.

The plot is reasonably good, the music and voice acting are done better than some (not perfect, mind you, but decent), and it's graphically well made.  The ""detective scene"" portions are, as far as I can tell, unique to this game and it's nice to see some variation in a genre that tends to reuse and overuse the same types of puzzles constantly.One problem I can see is the length; I clocked in at 2.6 hours with only about 2 of those hours being in the first playthrough (the rest was going back to grab a missed achievement, since I'm crazy like that).  At this short of a play time, it does not warrant the full $9.99 price tag, but if you can find a decent sale, it's completely worth it.The other potential ""con"" to the game is that the HO scenes are not at all challenging and the puzzles are also relatively simple to complete.  If you're a veteran HO gamer looking for challenging puzzles, this isn't what you're looking for.  But if you're interested in a casual, simple game that won't take too much brain-power to get through, you'll probably like it.TL;DR: this a fun, short, and casual game that is worth picking up on sale."

But compared to other hidden-objects games I've played, this one is hardly reaching the average level. First of all, the objects finding seems to be too easy, actually one of the easiest. The objects are big and barely hidden. Players can just randomly click the items without checking the list and get half of them right. It is a major let down. And the plot is too obvious as well. You can easily tell the creepy bold mayor with a snake voice is the criminal here (sorry for the spoiler, but it is just too obvious). And interesting thing, when you analyzed the whole situation in a crime scene and knew the guy has locked the snake in the closet, the following move is of course ""Let's see what is in the closet, shall we? it seems so interesting. OMG, it is really a snake, hahaha, oh well, just shoot it with all my bullets."" The mini puzzles are way too easy. I guess this game is designed for rookie HO game players aging from 5 - 10. There are supposed to be more lines for the characters when a wrong object is used instead of just ""NO!"". Com'n just give couple of more minutes.

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.That's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.They do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.My recommendation, because of the ""if you've played one you've played them all"" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games."

Well, no, I'd have a hard time actually recommending it to someone to play.The plot is a bit iffy, but my biggest issue with the game is I felt like there were a number of cases were there wasn't really any logic as to where I should go next.  Rather than encountering a new area and exausting the possible click puzzles until I had everything I needed, I sometimes found myself wandering each section of the map pixel hunting to see if a new hidden object puzzle had come up.  Often there was no rhyme or reason to it, and new puzzles would appear in the same place as old puzzles but now the plot had been advanced and you needed to figure out to check it again.Maybe this is normal for games in this genre, but I haven't felt that way so far with the other games from Artifex Mundi.That said, there was enough good in the game that I'm still looking forward to playing 9 Clues 2."

You search the area, solve simple but fun puzzles and go through several hidden object segmeants and end up getting caught up in a lovecraftian mystery, albeit Yig instead of Cuthulu.The art in the game is colorful (despite the whole thing taking place at night) and everything is well drawn.  The voice acting is nothing to write home about but its not terrible.  Overall its presented very well.As far as adventure games go this one was pretty easy but still enjoyable. part of what makes most point and click games hard is trying to figure out what items and in what order your suppose to use them in.  Its pretty obvious what your supposed to do with most objects in this game but i find that rather refreshing given how mind bogglingly stupid some of the puzzles in other adventure games can be.The game is aimed at more casual players.  If your ever lost you can look at your map to show you where theres a puzzle you need to solve and if your still stuck there is a recharging hint system.  That being said the game is pretty easy and can be beaten in about 3 hours without hints.  Also several puzzles are used mulitipule times and each hidden object location is used twice just with a new list of items.The story is decent.  theres a small cast of colorful characters to interact with and the plot throws some twists and turns here and there but don't expect anything amazing.  Without spoiling anything you'll usally be able to tell who the bad guys are just by looking at them.  so the story feels kinda like a scooby doo mystery.  fun but nothing ground breaking.Again i don't play many hidden object games so i can't really tell how it stacks up to others but judging it just as an adventure game i had fun.  Its got just enough challenge to give your brain a stretch without ever feeling like a pain.  give it a play if your looking for a lite adventure game.  though i don't know if i'd chose this as a launching point to test the waters of hidden object games."

Hidden object scenes were good and so were most of the puzzles. Only problem i had was the second time you had to do the HO scene in the mayors car there was one item that wouldnt register me clicking it. Looked it up and it seemed to be a fairly common problem, all you had to do was try clicking all over the item until it picked it up. Worth picking up for a couple of bucks if you like this genre of game."

I wasn't really into the setting (I like the more fantasy or old world settings), but it was well put together and grew on me.  For what it's worth, the second game  in the series is better, and I wasn't sure about that one either to begin with.  This game was about a 6.5 or 7/10 for me, but that's partly my bias toward pretty fantasy worlds.  :)"

I also didn't feel like it was a cliché, at least not entirely, unlike Enigmatis 1. Also, the voice acting was bleh for the most part (like most HOG's games I've encountered). The main character's voice is probably the worst, it sounds....breathless? I'm not quite sure how to explain it. A few character's weren't too bad though.Gameplay wise, the hidden object scenes were nothing amazing (at least on normal mode), and some scenes repeat at least 2-3 times. Normally it takes me a good few minutes to find everything with the newer games, but with this game I could breeze through those scenes easily, which means experts and hardcore player's will probably find this game far too easy. Unlockable hidden objects are also easy to do and don't take much work (about 1 to 2 per scene). The puzzles were easy as well and don't take long. Basically, the game is short, so if you want a long game this might not be for you. There is also a map for teleportation, and there is quite a bit of backtracking.The achievements are easy to get, and even if you mess up during your first play-through, a quick run through a second game will easily complete them. I missed some of the clues during my first run but gathered the ones I could still obtain, and during my second run I only needed to gather the missing ones and I got the achievement.Overall, good game and recommend you get it for your collection when it is on sale."

I play a LOT of HOG's, I must say this one was a great addition to my collection. It had an interesting storyline, which I am sure was supposed to be scary, however I found it quite amusing and just couldn't wait until my suspicions were proven to be true. The game was fairly short, and very easy for a HOG, but I actually found this to be refreshing. I think this would even be a great game to start someone off with who is new to HOG's. Achievements were also very easy to get 100% in, so no second playthroughs needed, like many other Artifex Mundi games.Pros:* Short and sweet* Easy Puzzles* Interesting Plot ( If a bit silly, lol )* Detective Mode ( A new mode of searching for objects that is only in the 9 Clues games )* Easy Achievements* Sets up story for the 2nd game in seriesCons:* Voice-acting was a little hokey ( I actually liked it, but I'm a little hokey myself, lol )* Game may be too short for some ( read, buy it on sale if that bothers you )* May also be too easy for Die-Hard HO gamers  ( it's ok just to relax sometimes, lol )* Limited Re-playability ( Meaning: you don't HAVE to replay it; only if you want to )To be honest, it's hard for me to come up with any real cons for this game. So, basically, if you like HOG's, then you should own this game, and the next in the series, 9 Clues 2: The Ward. For those of you who think this one is too easy, the second game in the series is a little more difficult, so that should give you reason to start your journey with this series today."
