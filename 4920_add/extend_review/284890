Seriously? No one even took the trouble of giving a proper name to the protagonist? Oh, well. Madam Detective is asked to investigate the mystery of a lost cargo ship. It is explained to us that the ship never reached its destination, found in the open sea without a crew and its cargo, sometime after its departure. Oh, also we have the ghost of a young girl who tries to sabotage us half way through the game, and aid us during the other half.My first complaint is about the story's presentation. If you pay attention to the story and the obvious lack of function in procedure for the investigation of the ship, you know the identity of the murderer within the first 15 minutes that you play the game. The rest is spared to understand reasons, that's all. The bonus chapter that we expect in every Artifex Mundi game to shed some light into the background of affairs doesn't exist in this game, sorry.Puzzles are annoyingly basic. Hidden object scenes are so easy that it becomes boring after a while, and there is no alternating gameplay. There is an obscene amount of backtracking compared to other games. The setting and the art work is pretty, but not spectacular. I've seen better in9 CluesorGrim Legends. You keep listening to the same 30 second music in the background again and again until you decide to mute it.I know it is not commonly expected for a HOG to bear decent story or event decent gameplay, but Artifex Mundi is supposed to be a decent contradiction to that idea. If this game would come from any other HOG developer I'd smile and write a brief recommendation. Not for Artifex Mundi. Oh wait, this isn't developped by Artifex Mundi! They are only the producer! Now the actual mystery of the game is explained! But why they've attached their name to this game? That is another mystery.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

Even so, I enjoyed this title because it’s so simple that it became relaxing to me at some point. I recommend it especially to people that are starting to get into HOGs, and of course, if you just want a quick experience.5/10. Get it only on a huge sale, it’s not worth paying the full price on this one (it’s really short, maybe the shortest HOG I’ve played so far)."

The best non Artifex Mundi developed hidden object game on Steam that I have played.This is the big one,VERYshort. Normally without bugs I expect to playthrough in about 3-4 hours and then do a speed run on expert level to gain the expert level achievement if there is one and to mop up any other missed achievements. Giving a total time of around 6-7 hours skipping all of the cut scenes on the second play through.  This game took 3.2 hours to play though once with all the cutscenes running and once skipping them. So two play throughs, the first taking only 2 hours.Good thing it currently has 30% off.Would I recommend it, yes, it is well made, certainly compared with many of the hidden object games on Steam.  But with the advice that you play all of the Artifex Mundi games first and only play this if you are running out of hidden object games on Steam to play, and you wait until it has at least 50% off."

I ended up skipping almost everything hoping that the game will end soon. The story is dull and not original there was no reason for me to care about the events. It also had a few WTF moments because some of the scenes were totally ridiculous. The voice acting is not terrible but I have seen better. Is there anything positive to say about the game? Yes! Some places were well designed.

The only complaints one can have are the lack of spoken lines and the characterisation of the protagonist (her name is Madame Detective, for heaven’s sake!).The puzzles are mostly the same types we meet in other Artifex Mundi titles, this time with decreased difficulty. The genre-defining hidden object scenes are excellent, as always, but a little too empty: a few of them are almost completely cleared out after two visits.Play time is also short– around two hours–, which is compensated by the low price range. So if you want a good alternative for a movie ticket, Left in the Dark may provide an entertaining afternoon.All in All Left inthe Dark: No One on Boardis a really nice Adventure Game!9/10 From MeSweep"

This entry features the same female voice actress for the protagonist as in many Artifex Mundi games, who turns in an average performance.  The supporting voice actors' quality seems to have dropped a few grades.  Graphics are nice for a cheap point and click.  This entry does not have a ""bonus adventure"" that many other AM titles have, and I was able to complete it easily in under 2 hours.  Puzzles seem simpler and took very little brain power.  If I had a choice, I probably wouldn't buy it again unless it was $2 or maybe $3.Also, you'll wish desperately for a different music loop after about 5 minutes of the same 20 second sound clip."

Art is okay.The bad: Voice acting (cheesy), puzzles (both too easy AND unclear), translation (this pipes, etc.), hidden objects (not just well hidden but frustrating), plot, too many collections going on at once without enough motivation (what do I need these pieces for? Who knows but I need 3 of them I guess, and 2 of these, and 2 of those.), too many locations, too much wandering around if you don't use the map to tell you where the actions are.I've really liked the Artifex Mundi games I've played but this is a really substandard one."

On the one hand, I enjoyed the game (enough to do a second playthrough to finish the last two achievements).  On the other, the $9.99 price tag seems really steep for the length of the game.  I picked it up on sale so I have no regrets, but if I'd shelled out ten bucks for it, I'd have been mildly annoyed.  As of now, I have 3.7 hours on record with two full playthroughs, and that's simply not ten dollars worth of game to me.That said, if you can grab it on sale, do so if you like this style combination of adventure/puzzle/hidden-object.  The story was simple but engaging enough, the puzzles were manageable (actually pretty easy, honestly), and the hidden object scenes were graphically well-done and ranged from easy to pretty challenging.  My only real complaint was the voice acting for your main character, which was not well done (overacted, hammed-up, over-the-top, pick your phrase but the idea is the same).  I couldn't stand hearing myself narrate.  But other than that, enjoyable game.TL;DR:  Pick it up on sale for a couple hours easy entertainment, but don't expect more than that."

So there's your typical 'point and click adventure game'-style gameplay where you collect items and use them on objects in the game world in order to advance. And then there's a lot of puzzle-solving, including the genre's typical 'hidden objects puzzles' (HOP) that show you a scene cluttered with objects and require you to spot specific items in that scene.The HOPs are 'old school' in that they require you to just find and click on the items listed at the bottom of the screen (whereas newer HOGs mix it up a bit by requiring you to combine items or use one item on another to acquire the hidden object). ButLeft in the Dark: No One on Board's HOPs are of great quality, finding that golden mean between requiring the player to go pixel hunting and placing the 'hidden' objects so plainly in sight that no searching is required and the player doesn't feel challenged at all.The other puzzles ofLeft in the Dark: No One on Boardare very decent. If you're looking for puzzles that'll have you stumped for hours, this isn't your game. But most puzzles do offer a challenge and will require some thinking to solve them, at least.As is typical for HOGs, you can select a difficulty mode forLeft in the Dark: No One on Boardthat determines whether interactable spots in the game are highlighted from time to time, or not. The difficulty mode also determines how often you can use a 'hint' if you're stuck in the game or in a HOP, and whether or not you can skip a puzzle entirely.StoryYou play an unnamed female detective who's asked to investigate a ship that went missing but has now reappeared without its crew or cargo. The game adds elements from a classic ghost story and from a classic slasher story to the mix, and there you have your mysteries to solve.The story won't win any awards but it's decent enough to keep a HOG going. Or, in other words, to keep the player motivated to keep on puzzling. The writing is also decent, although I do feel I should mention one gripe I found with the writing, because it's just so strange: people call you 'Madam Detective', ok, but you're alsoreferred toas 'Madam Detective', even when people write about you in a newspaper. That's just strange. Even the developer refers to the main character as 'Detective' in the game's description, again as if that's a name and not a profession.Graphics and soundThe graphics ofLeft in the Dark: No One on Boardare fine for a HOG. Like in most HOGs I think the scenes look very nice but static. I don't understand why they don't add ambient moving objects a bit more often. It would lighten up the scenes so much more with so little effort, really.The music is atmospheric and of high quality. The sound effects are sharp and spot on. The voice acting is mediocre, with the exception of the protagonist's voice actress who sounds a bit more convincing than her male colleagues. Turns out she's Kristin Price (although credited in this game as Kristin Price-Wilson), the same actress who voiced the protagonist female detective in the Artifex Mundi HOG series 'Enigmatis' and who did a terrific job in those games, as well.On Steam's extra featuresLeft in the Dark: No One on Boardhas 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.The 13 Steam Achievements are a nice mix of some story-related achievements, a few achievements awarded for not skipping puzzles and not using hints, and several missable achievements that are awarded for various optional tasks, so a completionist will want to use a guide."

However, a ghost appears to you and guide you to find the truth behind her family death and the disappearance of many sailors...Left in the Dark: No One on Board is another Artifex Mundi's game, though they're only the publisher here. However, as you're used to me and many others saying it, Artifex Mundi is always choosing good games. Left in the Dark isn't perhaps the best title out there but it's still very enjoyable.While the story has a correct plot, it's just a shame that everything is chaotic. Indeed, you're first investigating murders before having a ghost guiding you to the culprit and even discover that people thought dead are alive. I liked however the fact that it's a woman being the detective, in a time where I'm pretty sure it was though to be an active woman (it's maybe the 19th century but women were more seen as wives and mothers than a real asset for the society).The gameplay is pretty standard: use items that you find lying around (or hidden somewhere), clear hidden objects scenes and solve puzzles. I must say that while the puzzles are really easy, the hidden objects scenes are a little harder than expected as some of the items aren't really visible and that the translation was sometimes a little bad. As I've said, you're in the 19th century but I don't why I was feeling that some objects were kinda anachronic. The only puzzle that could be a problem is the lockpick one, as you have to put your cursor on the lockpick to make sure it's working, however, the item in itself is moving, so if your cursor is too far, you will have to restart.The graphics are more than acceptable, though I was under the impression that some of the backgrounds seemed rushed. It's the same feeling as in the hidden objects scenes. The characters aren't really seen, but the look of the detective is really great: somewhere with a steampunk inspiration, very badass.The soundtrack is good too, so, are the voice actings.Left in the Dark is a good game, though it's not the best Artifex Mundi, even when it was released. I would recommend to wait for a discount (and Left in the Dark has been often in the situation) or a bundle (it's also often bundled)."

Left in the Dark: No One on Board is a short but surprisingly good hidden object puzzle game with a nice horror theme. The game was made with hand drawn graphics and art which is amazingly well done and you can just see that there was a lot of love, time, and effort put into this game. Some of the puzzles are easy while some were genuinely brain boggling. I liked the hidden object puzzles as they required me to closely examine the entire scene to locate needed items and some of them are so hidden so well the untrained eye will spend a good five to ten minutes looking for them.The voice acting is subpar but does not really spoil the mood and feel of the game as it provides enough to keep you entertained throughout.However, I am not too impressed by the cliche feeling of the ending but it doesn't stop me from recommending this good puzzle game.

Not recommended.ReviewYou play as Madam Detective, an apparently nameless yet famous detective. You’re hired to investigate the mysterious disappearance of the crew and cargo of a ship. Almost immediately you are set upon by ghosts and a hooded guy running around with a big hook. If that sounds like the plot of a really bad horror movie… well, it is. The story never rises above bad and the presentation doesn’t improve it. There is very little interaction with other characters; rather most of the story is told through notes and papers with incredibly ugly fonts that don’t match the world at all. I appreciate that they want to make it easy to read, but that can be done without making it incredibly ugly.Still, the story is not the worst part. The mini-games are few and far between. The HOGs are of the “find 12 items that are completely unrelated to the story and one that you’ll need” variety. At the beginning they have some items being hidden, but even that is abandoned after a few HOG sections. This means that despite the game being very short (I finished it on expert mode with all achievements in 2.5 hours), it still manages to get boring and repetitive. Without a compelling story or interesting gameplay it gets very difficult to recommend this game, even at the low price I got it (1.5 Euro)."

You can choose the level of difficulty you prefer.  Mini games can be challenging but hints are available and it is possible to skip a mini game should it prove too difficult to solve.   A map makes navigation between scenes less repetitive.  The graphics are good.  I found the story line interesting.  A sense of urgency develops as one nears the completion of the game.

I played the game through in several sessions on the low difficulty setting, but a more experienced gamer would probably be able to complete the game in two or three sessions."

After seeing how well recieved most Artifex Mundi developed and published games were, I decided to take a chance. The story revolves around a young woman dectective brought in to solve a case involving a ship and it's missing crew. While the story is not amazing, it kept me interested enough for the the 3 hours or so the game takes to complete.  I definately wouldn't mind returning to the world in a sequel.I really enjoyed the beautiful areas of the game. Almost evey area and hidden object area was very well done and quite detailed. Only one or two areas maybe didn't match up to the rest of the game. For the most part, the hidden object sections are fairly easy. However, there is a hint system is place if you get stuck. The puzzles in the game are pretty easy too, with a hint system for those that might need it.  There is also difficultly settings that change how easy it is to spot interaction points and how the hint system works.There is voice acting in the game and it is decent. The two female main characters voices are fine, with other being passable. Nothing horrible though.Overall, I really enjoyed is game and look forward to trying some more Hidden Object games."

,Recommended,284890,14695946,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,CPA,"Not one of Artifex's best publications, but maybe it's because they didn't actually work on the game.Only took a little over 3 hours (don't rely on hours on record as I accidently left the game running in the background).  No hints were needed, however, playing any mode other than Expert will reveal where there are actions to be taken on the map.  That in itself acts as a hint system.  Didn't know this when I selected the Advanced mode.Voice acting is ridiculously bad, especially the end ""boss"".  You can hear the muffling into the microphone.  I busted out laughing when he started talking.  Script isn't much better.No bugs, so that's a positive.  Art is okay.  It's definitely in the very casual bucket of games.  I'll still give it a thumbs up because it did hold my attention enough to finish it, but there are definitely better Hidden Picture games out there."

76561198142934082,Recommended,284890,15819348,"Posted: 13 May, 2015",all,Karrolanth,"Recommended with a few qualifications.  Like other reviewers, I wish there was a 'meh' button sometimes!I'm still fairly new to this genre, having played about three other titles so far.  I found this one to be average but not, in my opinion, worth the full price tag.  On sale, however, it's worth a look especially if you're a newcomer to this type of game.The game is quite short, probably only a couple of hours if you don't wander off and leave it running like I did a few times!  :)  Most of the puzzles are easy, although I did skip one that I just couldn't get.The hidden object scenes seem to vary in quality - some are quite detailed and have hard-to-spot objects, others are painfully obvious.  It's not hard to get the 'click four things in four seconds' achievement.  The names given to some of the objects can make it hard to find the right thing in a couple of the scenes, though.The story was okay, I guess - nothing special, and the twist at the end didn't really have the effect it probably should have had.  I'm not sure why; perhaps it was due to the acting, or the way it was wrapped up so quickly.  There were other scenes that should have been tense due to imminent danger, but just didn't really achieve that feeling.  As an example,although the water is apparently rising fast towards a sparking electrical cable, I have plenty of time to not only rummage around in a pile of junk for something useful but also to visit a couple of other rooms and thengo backto the 'dangerous' area for more stuff.  Rather than being in fear for my life, I felt like I could have had a party down there and invited a few friends over to splash around for a couple of hours...Ah yes... the voice acting.  Well, the female voice was okay, but nothing special and somewhat lacking in appropriate emotion for the scene.  Most of the male actors are bearable at best.  There is one particular male actor, however, who was just atrocious!  (Sorry, whoever you are.)  And I have never heard anyone pronounce 'arrrrgh' the way it's spelled... not when they're meant to be seriously 'acting', anyway!All in all, if you can ignore the poorer aspects of the game - and can get it on sale, I wouldn't recommend you pay full price - it's a fairly enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.  And I defy you not to laugh at the method of opening the lighthouse door..."

But as a newcomer to the genre, I really enjoyed this game. The puzzles were engaging for me and I liked the atmosphere/visuals of the game. I didn't mind playing through it twice to get achievements I missed. My play time reflects two playthroughs.It's a decent point-and-click hidden object game. If you can get it on sale, I'd recommend it. I would not want to pay the full price because it is short and not exceptional."

It is not a long game and the painted graphics can sometimes lead to difficulties in finding an item or two, but not really a problem. I also liked it because it was a solid 50/50 split between puzzles and hidden object. If you can get it on discount, do so."

Maybe a 5/10.The narration is awful and most of the puzzles are very easy.Also, the history isn't good.It's just another point and click game. Some browser games are better than this, and they are free.I don't give a thumbs down just because I paid less than $1 in this game. It was almost free and gave me some hours of entertainment."

Story makes not a shred of sense, voiced by someone with slightly better than passing familiarity with the English language, but whose Ps Ds Ts and Ss are all a bit Germanically emphatic. Scenes are colourful and pretty, puzzles are fair and evenly paced.It's not memorable, but if you want something to stick in the memory, read a good book. This gets nothing wrong and when it's in the sale, it's a perfect way to lose a few mindless hours in a point-n-click simulation of a moment of absence."

I enjoyed the puzzles some were easy and some were a bit hard and you have a hint system if you played Robin quest than you will know how it works it regenerates quickly and if you are stuck on a puzzle than  you can use the mini game and it will do it for you. In Robin quest there is a solve button which does it for you.It is good to see female characters used as in a lot of games you have the male ones and it is good to hear the female voice and the graphics and environment are good and a nice game to play at night or in the day and gives yoiu a positive feeling and will try the advanced and expert mode and see how it goes.
