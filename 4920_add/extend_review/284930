76561197996678922,Not Recommended,284930,10155708,"Posted: 17 May, 2014",all,Pscion Piper (Julie),"While this game does have a lot going for it, and I am enjoying it for what it is, there are a lot of details that are lacking or completely absent that would prevent me from recommending this game to anyone that isn't madly craving isometric combat racing.The good:Multiple cars of 3 classes that can be upgraded and switched back and forth. Regret a purchase? Switch back to a previous car that is still fully upgraded and you knew how to win in. You can't sell any cars you own, but its nice to know you won't screw yourself mid-game with a bad choice.Circuits are replayable as many times as you'd like. Try again and again to beat one, or replay a circuit as a cash-cow until you've got your funding for an upgrade.This game does not use any resources from R&RR. It is the same game format and a similar concept, but there is nothing directly copied, so I can't see any takedown issues over this game.Music is good, but repetative. Graphics are good, and show speed well. Opponents are good at blocking you in while the playing field is evenly matched.The game concept is sound, and is exactly what you think it is... but...The iffy and bad:There is no map. There are signs before every turn that indicate the angle and direction, but without any way to see the full course, it is awkward trying to plan out the best path. Because the tracks are somewhat uniform, it takes a good bit of memorization to know when a turn is coming, and when is a good or bad time to use the turbo boost.There both is and isn't gamepad support: my x360 gamepad works in the actual game, but not in the menus. There is no indication anywhere in-game of what buttons do what, and there is no way to reconfigure the gamepad buttons in the settings menu. For the record:RT: accelerateLT: brake/reverseA: turboB: rear weaponX: front weaponY: respawn from off-trackYou will need to use the keyboard ENTER and ESC for any and all menus. There is no mouse-click to match to the ESC button, and several menus do not have a back function beyond ESC. This is annoying, but workable. A different controller might be more effective than mine, but this is what I have.Weapons do not adjust for terrain. This game has a lot of ramps, jumps, and drops as you drive around the course, and even though some front-firing weapons do track after opponents, they frequently crash into a change in the track's slope. Again, track memorization will help, but that takes time to learn and there is no map to give hints to your location. Since weapons do not automatically reload to full between races, this can burn through your money.Power-ups are plentiful, but they are always in the center of the track, and are frequently taken by the lead vehicle. If you're trailing, you won't often find them... if you're leading, you can keep hitting them every few seconds, and unless you make a bad turn, you will not likely see another car for the rest of the race. This is kinda game-breaking, as this type of game is the most fun when you're actively fighting against the other cars.You can upgrade a car's armor and weapon count a total of 5 times each. You can upgrade a car's top speed and acceleration as a single stat, 5 times each... each time you upgrade, it will either boost top speed or acceleration. Not both, and you can't choose which one. Its a set path.You CANNOT upgrade your vehicle's handling. Your car will always turn at the same rate, and as you're able to drive faster, mid-to-late game cornering means hugging the outside of a turn and using the wall to grind around the corners because you simply cannot make the turns. Letting off of the accelerator button does not make your car turn any faster. Tapping the brake won't make you slide around a corner, but it will slow you down enough to make a turn... but there's not really a point to that, since grinding around the outer edge doesn't damage your car, and doesn't really slow you down enough to matter.You will spin badly in mid-air if you angle off of a jump wrong, and you will get turned around from collisions. Your car will roll forward off of some ramps, and there is no way to correct this, which will randomly slow you down on landings. While reverse does work, turning while backing up is VERY slow, and this cannot be improved. If you face the wrong way for more than a few seconds, the game will auto re-spawn your vehicle facing the right way in the center of the track... it will sometimes do this while you're in the middle of a turn if you aren't facing the correct way, and has happened to me twice, so far.The conclusion:The opponents are not very challenging once you've upgraded your cars a bit... get ahead of them, and keep your car in the middle of the track whenever possible, and any race is yours. The unmapped tracks, weird landings from the many jumps, and lack of handling are far more of a threat than any of the other cars. Without being able to play against other opponents (at this time), or increase the opponent AI difficulty (I have not fully beaten the game, that may be an option after 1 completion, but I don't see anything for now), this is not a very challenging game.If you're absolutely craving this kind of game, then get it, but be aware of what you're purchasing."

,Recommended,284930,10164343,"Posted: 18 May, 2014",all,Mangonelson,"This game is really fun. I'm really enjoying it so far.However, there are lots of room for improvement: First of all, this game NEEDS a multiplayer mode. I hope the developers will include this feature in the near future.While the races are fun and the gameplay is perfect, the menus are awful to say the least. The fact that you can play the game in your controller, but need to go to your keyboard just so you can select options in the menu is annoying. There's also no way to configure the controller layout for the game.Overall, the game is worth the money. As I said before, it's really fun once you start playing. I just hope that the developers will work to improve some of its flaws (Please fix the menus!!!!)"
,Not Recommended,284930,33099671,Posted: 1 July,all,Romulus,"It's not too hard and it's fun to advance,m but the stupidest thing is that you can't see what is coming. Top down only view, and no ability to view the track before racing. You have no idea when turns are coming except an arrow on the ground that appears split seconds before the turn. You also can't possibly see upcoming mines. Just a weak gameplay overall. Graphics don't make a game; gameplay does, and nobody who makes games seems to realize that anymore."
,Not Recommended,284930,28937722,Posted: 2 January,all,Zio,"Fun, but abandoned game. A shame. Do NOT pay ANY money for this.Usually I'm the first to defend a developer who's not making regular updates on things, but in cases such as this? The developer doesn't react to inquiries or anything. There are quite some issues and bugs that need attention...for over 2 years now.Due to this I will avoid saying anything more about the game itself. Next thing I'm gonna is try to contact the publisher, they usually have an open ear. If there's no substantial update in 2017, don't bother looking any further into this...unless you'd like to try make some pressure on the dev or something."

That's why, I can play games with only controller because reaching mouse and keyboard is a true pain for me. All I can do this is laying at my couch and playing games at my tv...Today I installed your game (which says it has 100% controller support) and I realized controller is not supported and %100 controller support was a lie. You can only do right, left, top, bottom but no button is working in the game. After starting the game, you cannot even quit because no buttons are working. It took me half hour to reach my keyboard and mouse to close the game.I cannot imagine why such a game developer or sales manager or whoever responsible for the game, would want to do this to a crippled person. Shame on you. I wish all of you will experience the same situation to understand me trully.Regards,"
76561198036368198,Not Recommended,284930,17298131,"Posted: 30 July, 2015",all,Lord Rutsah,"The problem with this is that the race is basically over once you're first around the first corner (aka spamming all your nitros at the start), if by any chance you're not first by then don't expect to come first by the end of the race. The only useful upgrade stat in-game is speed, armor and weapons are practically useless since the best way to win is to avoid combat alltogether. Also I've hit invisible walls in corners quite a few times which is a total buzzkill."

,Recommended,284930,35030653,Posted: 17 September,all,Tron,"Great game. Super easy learning curve. Usually 3rd to 1st place all the time. Not sure what all the Negative Reviewers are complaining about, bunch of whiny babies I guess.The Camera angle is limited, but it makes things more intense and I would say it's a great boon to gameplay not a problem at all. The whole point is not to see your enemy from miles away, but to boost/nitro and not even have to worry about them. When they come into view, drop an oil and keep going. Learning the maps is simple enough and I didn't find there was such limited time to make a turn due to camera angles. I never failed a turn.Negative reviews have to take something about the game that is actually done poorly. Otherwise they are personal opinion pieces where someone just wants their own game or is missing the point of the game. The Camera view is part of the point of the game, it was designed this way intentionally, it's not some flaw. Find another game if you can't cut it.You don't need to see your standing mid race. If you do, that's probably why you are losing. You're taking focus away from racing to look at your standing in the race. Am I third place? first? second? First of all it's really easy to predict what place you are when you've seen the race starts with so many cars and you passed three already. Secondly, just race and you'll find out at the end.People complaining about top down only view. Really ♥♥♥♥ off. That's like saying you bought Divinity Original Sin and you're upset it's an RPG and not an FPS. I grew up on games like this. Top view is what the game is. If you don't like top view, don't play it. If you don't like platformers, don't play those. Seems pretty logical? GTA2 was by far the best game of the series and it was top down only view. Thank god. When they came out with that 3D crap they called GTA3 I wouldn't touch it with a 1000 meter pole. But at least I didn't buy the game and then complain it's 3D and first person view only, and whine that I don't have a top view.Lastly this game is literally $1 on sale. I already knew the negative reviews were persoanl preference pieces and not good criticism of the game just by reading what people were saying. But a game with 90% negative reviews that were legit would still be worth buying at $1 because thre's no way i'd not get my money worth playing it.Now something like Pillars of Eternity, which is $100 for the game and all the DLCs, is not worth playing despite having less negative reviews. First off the negative reviews for Pillars are way better and have way more merit and actually show flaws with the game. And secondly even if Pillars had no negative reviews and was perfect i would still never get $100 back in playing it. Never. Maximum for a perfect game is $50, and because Pillars is not perfect, has major issues with a bad/boring storyline, and crap stat mechanics, and poor loot/treasures and small tiny maps the game is definitely not even worth $50. Max I'd pay for that Pillars of crap is $25 with all DLC included."

First of all, there isn't full controller support as you can't navigate through the menus or pause a race with the controller (with either the Logitech F310 or the XBox One). Secondly, the campaign is too short for the full price and there's grinding to be done on just the first circuit.

,Not Recommended,284930,12196708,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,HefBot 2.0,"As I round the final bend at speed, my hovercraft's tyres screeching, oh hang on, that's probably just a bug, I rocket towards the finish line and give a disappointed ""meh, is this all there is to this game?""This game is trying to be Rock N Roll Racing, without the sound track, without the variation in vehicles, without much effort. It's bizarre how the game locks you into your lane, almost doing away with the need for steering. I say almost because for the most part you can just let your car smack into the rounded corners and allow your car grind along the barrier. Some barriers will look as smooth as the rest, however will send you careening back in the opposite direction.The characters you meet (the other racers) tend to have no personality in their driving, and are strangely supportive of you between races on the loading screen, encouraging you to do better or congratulating you on a job well done. With the exception of the female-esque final baddie, who just spouts passive-agressive missives at you. Why does this robot have boobs and an accusing face anyway? Does it help her race?There are a lot of games that do a lot better than this. Sure it's pretty, sure it passes the time okay, and sure it's cheap; but you get what you pay for.Buy it or don't."

My biggest peeve with this game though is the fact of how it feels overall incompleted and you not only have to deal with the AI to win the races but so many glitches! For example when you reset your vehicle anywhere near someone you get launched off the screen. Goodluck catching back up after that since it takes forever to reset...."
,Not Recommended,284930,18434125,"Posted: 11 October, 2015",all,Ace T'Ken,"- It may say it has full controller support, but it does not. You can't navigate the menus with one and can not remap anything. Playing racing games on a keyboard isn't great.- The tracks are all the same with no visual difference. There is nothing in the way of graphical options beyond resolution.- The powerups are all in the middle of the track with little variation leaving nothing for anyone but the CPU in first. Once you're in last, you're not getting out. All powerups will be gone as you pass and the AI isn't particularly forgiving. You have to grind the first tournament over and over to get any cash.- Bad audio. The sound effects make everything feel like a toy, or (Like when you end a race) are completely missing. You go from crossing the finish line to at a menu with no effect whatsoever.- Crashes often.- Basically abandoned. This game needs a major patch or a complete overhaul. Look at the news. There's no updates from the dev and it's been a very long time. I think it's DOA.Save your money."
