ITS SO ANNOYING.  For an otherwise quite relaxing game that sound makes me wince every 10 seconds .**Update** The above is no longer an issue!Very impressed that the developers actually listened to my wee moan. A rare thing indeed in todays gaming industry.I heartily recommend this game , very relaxing and a good way to unwind.Many thanks indeed Decayinglogic!I'll be sure to follow your future projects."
,Not Recommended,284950,12725169,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,DreaddJester,"So why do I not recommend this game yet still love the game???? Well the answer is quite puzzling...Let me begin by saying that if you enjoy a good jigsaw puzzle you will find great enjoyment within this game. There is a definite feel of working a jigsaw puzzle here and it's quite relaxing and enjoyable. The pictures are decent and give some good challenge in matching up the pieces and once you get to the larger piece puzzles it really feels like your working a real jigsaw puzzle on a table top.Another interesting slant on this game is that in many puzzles the pieces are cut in ways you could never cut a real life puzzle. This is good in the sense that it opens up new challenges with matching up pieces and actually adds to the puzzle experience in ways that only a virtual puzzle could. It's bad in a way too though because some of these cut styles up the difficulty in matching pieces by cut to sky high levels that make it nearly impossible to do, leaving you to rely on color matching alone. If you’re looking for more challenge though this is certainly a way to get it in ways that physical puzzles could never match so I think this is certainly a positive overall.So where does it all go so wrong?? It's a couple of things that on the lower end, smaller piece puzzles, you won't experience too badly but as you climb up to the high piece puzzles will have you ripping your hair out. The first and most obvious fault is that there is NO mid puzzle save feature. On the small piece puzzles this isn't so much an issue as you can solve them in 15-20 minutes tops. However as you approach the larger piece puzzles this becomes an issue as most people don't have all morning or night to finish a puzzle. Your only option is to leave the game running in the background of your computer, which isn't a horrible option, but sucks down your computers resources if you'd like to go play another game for a while or sucks down electricity if you'd rather just power down your computer for the night.... And there's really no excuse for why the developers couldn't have coded a simple mid-puzzle save feature for this.The second flaw is in piece selection. The pieces float around in a ""river"" around the puzzle which honestly works as it allows you to see the pieces and really resembles the pieces in a box being shaken around a bit only probably better as all the pieces are right side up. Another area where virtual is somewhat better than real life. The problem occurs when you see a piece floating out there amongst all the other pieces that you know fits somewhere and you go to grab it, it's as if the program actually goes out of its way to give you every piece except the one you want.... You'll be clicking and clicking though a million pieces just to get the one you want that you can see right in front of you. Several times per puzzle I've clicked on the piece I wanted while it was clearly in the open, with my curser only touching that piece, and been given a different piece. Then when I release that unwanted piece back into the river the piece I wanted disappears from its current location and reappears somewhere else, usually in a mess of many other pieces again..... Super frustrating.At the end of the day, because of those flaws I cannot in all fairness give this game a recommendation. These are flaws that could have, and should have been addressed by the developer before or soon after the game was released. Is there a market for virtual jigsaw puzzle games?? I think the answer is yes. Ways to improve upon the design?? First off mid-puzzle saving is a must. Second off improve the puzzle selection process and perhaps give us two to four ""ponds"" to place specific pieces in where they will float around separated from the river. Lastly, maybe allow for players to use their own pictures to create their own original puzzles. Maybe even have a Steam Workshop for those puzzles..... I certainly think there's a market for jigsaw puzzle games but this one has too many frustrating flaws to really grow that market..."

It needs more puzzles or a way to use your pictures to create your own puzzles. I have had no issues with this at all. Great work more scope for this to be improved to make it even better for me. Needs DLC'S AND A PUZZLE CREATURE I think this would make it future alot better for people to buy it.

,Recommended,284950,12917729,"Posted: 12 November, 2014",all,lovinglife139,"After fully completing the game (9 hours for one playthrough), I'm finally reviewing it, and I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys jigsaw puzzles. I LOVE jigsaws, but find myself unable to partake in many because I have so few flat surfaces around my home, and I also have quite a few cats that are always determined to chew and eat the pieces. Pixel Puzzles allows the player to piece together jigsaws without the hassle.There are a few pros and cons to the game when compared to regular jigsaws that I thought I'd point out. For one, the puzzles are extraordinarily easy for those of us who are used to piecing together 500 or 1000 piece + jigsaw puzzles. Why? The top tier puzzle is, I believe, only 300 pieces, for one thing. Another thing is that the pieces are always rightside up; that is, you never have to turn pieces around clockwise or counter-clockwise to try different sides in different places. When you place a piece in its respective spot, it ""clicks"" into place, which can be seen as a pro and a con. For one thing, that's convenient, but for another, sometimes I would place a piece in about the area I thought it would go, and it would snap into place, taking away the challenge of guesswork, trial and error. There were also a few times I'd grab pieces that were unique to save them for later, only for them to snap into place simply because I'd placed them on the board in just the right place, when I'd had no intention on placing it yet.Many reviews state the lack of a save feature as a flaw, but I had no trouble with this. I'd sit down for an hour and knock a few of them out. I 100% the game without knowing whether or not there was a save feature, since I never needed it. The puzzles have so few pieces even in the top tiers that 45 minutes to an hour is the most you will likely need to set aside.The one flaw that actually DID bother me that others have mentioned is the piece selection. Unused pieces float around the borders of the puzzle area in a pool of water, and they can overlap while floating. If you see a piece you want, it can take a few tries to pick the right one, and this can, admittedly, be infuriating. I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and one of my ""obsessions"" is that I have to complete the border of a jigsaw puzzle before placing any middle pieces. This one flaw had me reeling quite a few times, because I'd have my eye on a border piece and kept trying incessantly to pick it up, only to pick up dozens of middle pieces in the process. This was pretty time consuming, since I couldn't progress in the puzzle personally until I had the border complete, and this sometimes would take picking up half of the entire puzzle's pieces and setting them aside to accomplish.The last issue with the game is that I couldn't find a way to view what the completed puzzle would look like once I was putting it together. So in the midst of a puzzle, the player can't pick up a piece and check the ""box"", if you will, to guess just about where it will go. In the end, while this is technically an issue, I didn't mind it. It presented a challenge in the game that I enjoyed taking on due to the fact that the game is easier than regular jigsaws.All in all, if you like jigsaws, you will probably enjoy this, and I highly recommend it for those of you who find it hard to make the room for physical jigsaws, as this is the next best thing. While the game is fairly short, I thought it was a great deal as I got it on sale and I ended up paying less than $1.00 per hour of playtime, which is a great value. I highly encourage the developers to consider more pixel puzzle games with other varieties of subject matters, as I'll definitely be supporting future releases."

The music is soothing and the puzzles make lovely pictures.  There are 26 achievements that are fun to get.  It took me almost 20 hours to get them all.There are three drawbacks.  First there is no save feature.  So you have to complete each puzzle before leaving the game or start over.  Some of the harder puzzles took me a couple hours or so to complete so this was quite annoying.  Second the piece size decreases since they cannot increase the puzzle size.  If you have a small computer screen or poor eyesight this may make things difficult.  Third a few of the puzzles make it hard to pick up the piece you want you have to grab other pieces and move them away from the piece you want in order to grab it.Even with these drawbacks it is an enjoyable experience and I am glad to have purchased the game.  However waiting for a sale might be a good idea.

Recommended for those who literally like to put puzzles together, and I do mean piece by piece.Pixel Puzzles: JapanHelp the monk reach enlightenment by doing the 5 levels of puzzles - 21 puzzles total.  (Poor thing by the end looks like his enlightment made him forget to take a bath.  Just made me chuckle, that is all.)Level 1: 6 puzzles - 60 pieces.  Level 2: 5 puzzles - 112 pieces. Level 3: 4 puzzles - 153 pieces. Level 4: 3 puzzles - 220 pieces. Level 5: 1 puzzle - 350 pieces, plus 2 bonus puzzles of 350+ pieces.  Extra feature - picture gallery of all puzzles.Each puzzle level becomes progressively ""harder"" 1) due to the amount of pieces and 2) due to the piece shape.Since there is really no place to sort pieces some creative stacking is required along the puzzle border or on the puzzle board itself. Fortunately once a piece is placed, it stays in place even if by serendipious chance it ends up in the middle of the puzzle board.For me the truest difficultly lie not so much the oddly shaped pieces in some puzzles but fishing the MOVING pieces out of the koi pond.  On two sides of each puzzle board is the koi pond where the pieces float and move along with water lillies and a swimming koi carp fish.  One can be aiming for a certain piece and miss getting that piece repeatedly.  Ah well, creative stacking.  One can even ""play"" with the koi fish.  The fish can be picked up and dropped on the puzzle board.  The fish will then squiggle back to the pond.The puzzles are iconic pictures from Japan: cherry blossoms, temple gardens, temples, castles, bridges, dragon dog, and even a dragon.  The picture gallery shows all the puzzle pictures.  The music is also iconic traditional Japanese music predominately played in temples."

I'm repairing the error now.Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a game where you have to rebuild an image which is a Japanese landscape. Each time the puzzle is completed, you unlock new ones, with more pieces (it can go over 300!). The pieces are floating in the pond, with a koi wandering around. Some of them hide a bonus that, once completed, can be used though I don't remember what it's doing - if I have it used at all. I was more focused on rebuilding a castle or a monastery or a park than worrying about it.Each puzzle shape are special: you can have arrows for example. As you don't know what's the image looks like (I suppose that the bonus is about showing for a few seconds the whole picture), you have to relay on the nuances of the color.As it's the first game in the series, there are negative points: taking the pieces isn't easy. Indeed, you want to take one but you're ending up with the one that was passing under it or around it. It lacks also of a saving feature: if you have to interrupt your game, you will have to redo the puzzle from the beginning. And as some can take hours to finish, you bet that it would be nice to save it and come back later.The game is still a very good, with beautiful landscapes and with a good challenge provided."

,Recommended,284950,9887036,"Posted: 20 April, 2014",all,Kyleia,"This is straightforward Jigsaw Puzzle solving game. The game would appeal to just about anyone, the puzzles increase in difficulty, but in the type of difficulty that larger-piece-puzzle brings. It's actually pretty relaxing.There's no penalty for putting a piece in the wrong place, and when you do find the right place, it snaps & can't be moved anymore. No time limits, just some jigsaw-solving goodness.  Great deal for the price.My only ""con"" is that the sound is so distracting that I had to turn it off. When you turn the volume to the lowest setting, it's still pretty loud, and the bamboo thing makes me violently angry after awhile. Kinda ruins the calm mood it puts you in.EDITED TO ADD 5/21/14: A patch was put in today where you can pick up the koi and put it into the bamboo, thus silencing it. Hurrah!A random side note, I enjoyed that not all the puzzles were in the traditional jigsaw shape, it was a fun change.  I just wish there were more puzzles. :("
,Recommended,284950,11280121,"Posted: 16 July, 2014",all,White,"So it's a jigsaw puzzle game with pictures of famous Japanese tourist spots and attractions like Himeji Castle, Osaka Castle, the gardens of Nijo Castle, and more. Controls are pretty self-explanatory, click and hold the left mouse button to drag pieces around and if you want to remove a non-locked piece from the field, you press the right mouse button. Fairly simple premise, but I mean, it's a jigsaw puzzle game, it shouldn't be that difficult.What's annoying about this game is how the pieces behave when they're not on the playing field.All of the pieces of the puzzle inhabit the border surrounding the upper and left sides of the frame, and these pieces don't stand still. Instead they're like little cardboard pieces continuously floating in any random direction while in a body of water. And it's really annoying when there's over 200 pieces in the puzzle and each individual piece is tiny. You can click and drag away the pieces you don't need and they'll teleport to another part of the frame. There's no ""safe spot"" aside from within the puzzle frame to store pieces for later and again, when there's over 200 pieces to work with, it's hard to keep track of some pieces and knowing whether you'll need that piece now or later.Another minor problem with this game is the lack of a save feature. What if I don't want to do the last 350 piece puzzle all in one sitting? I guess I would walk away from the computer, but what if I want to stop and play another game on Steam? It doesn't matter if I've just put down the first five pieces or I've finished a quarter of the puzzle because I have to decide if I want to see that puzzle to the end or completely drop my progress and start fresh the next time I start up PPJ. It's a minor annoyance, more so for the later puzzles.Some other small nitpicks...There's a restart button and a home button that's very close to the bottom of the frame of the puzzle. I've never accidentally hit either of these buttons while doing a puzzle, but basically...there's no prompt. If you hit the reset button, the entire puzzle resets. If you hit the home button, the game takes you right back to the main menu. A prompt would have been nice. There's also no real reference of the picture of the puzzle that you're trying to complete. Every now and again after you correctly place a piece down on the puzzle you can fill this powerup that lets you see the completed picture for a few seconds, but I've rarely been able to take advantage of this ability. The only time I really, absolutely needed it was for the last (non-bonus) puzzle.I'm still going to recommend this game though. It's a pretty good substitute if you're like me and want to play with jigsaw puzzles but lack the surface area in real life to devote your time to a 1000 piece puzzle."

Its ALMOST great...The first puzzles are fun and entertaining but as the piece count goes up they get annoyingly hard but not because of the puzzles. The UI is difficult and frustrating on large puzzles.I have completed all of the available puzzles and if you like puzzles and don't mind being patient trying to find your pieces I will say this game is worth buying on sale. If you get frustrated when a game doesnt do what you tell it to? avoid this game for now.- No subassemblies.Pieces will only lock in place when put on the right spot in the board and must be moved one at a time until then.- Difficult to grab the piece you see.The stream is unique and enjoyable until it is so full you can't grab the piece you see. The tip of the pointer doesnt matter. The game will simply choose a piece thats under your cursor which can be any of 20 at a moment. You can right click to clear an area and pick out the ones you want as they come into this spot but that means sending all the others back to the start... very frustrating. I started just making piles of my ""discard"" pieces to clear the stream.- No zoom. (nice to have but not game breaking)I have a smaller display on my notebook and often had to get too close to my screen to make out details. I got a bit of a headache when I tried to play for too long although it was probably from the piece selection issue more than finding the piece I wanted. I think a wider stream with scroll wheel to zoom and screen edges to pan would help a lot and we could have enjoyable puzzles at 1000+ pieces.-No work space.There is nowhere to place pieces other than within the frame of the puzzle or they fall back into the stream. It woudl be nice if we could pile up extra pieces on the right hand side where the monk is.I would love to see more puzzles released for this game. I would even buy some DLC if the devs do something to make the UI a bit more usable at larger sizes. Its great to have puzzles that are challenging but it should be the puzzle that creates the challenge not the interface."

What is Pixel Puzzles: Japan about? How does it work?Actually there's not much to say as the gameplay obviously consists in a puzzle to complete, so you have your central field where you can place the spare pieces floating on the upper and left side.Puzzles are divided in 5 difficulty levels with a decreasing number of puzzles each. Difficulty lies in the number of tiles and their dimension as well because the higher difficulty level brings smaller tiles. Besides, each puzzle set has tiles with their own shapes and harder difficulties bring more odd and irregular shapes. A small advise: play this game on the biggest screen you have.GRAPHIC. Engine And Artistic aspects.The entire game is animated in 2d so I can't scream ""miracle"", yet it doesn't look bad anyways, and despite the game's title it doesn't look that pixellous.SOUNDTRACK. Themes and Accompaniments.The soundtrack in the game consists of simple sporadic strumming of the Koto (a japanese typical instruments) with the water cane snapping from time to time, so it's mostly an atmosphere sound. I personally like it but some friend of mine just find it irritating for no reason at all... Bah...LAST NOTES. What doesn't work?Once again I've noticed the difficulty in catching the floating tiles with your cursor because the cursor itself seems to be programmed to pick up anything but the highest and closest tile you're pointing. I don't understand it but this will cost you lots of time just to catch the desired tile. The same problem is present in the undeadZ variant of the Pixel puzzle collection, and now I'm kind of expecting to find it in other releases as well... Oh And just like in the UndeadZ version this glitch/feature magically diasppear as you're trying to complete the final biggest puzzle.TL;DR. Pros And Cons+++PROs+++PUZZLE.A simple and relaxing puzzle game. That's it.MUSIC.There isn't a real soundtrack playing continuously but there will be random strummings of Koto (A Japanese instrument) to keep the Japanese mood.---CONs---CURSOR.For some odd reason the cursor seems intentionally glitchy as you will struggle to pick up the tile you're aiming while you will attract any other tile nearby. Pretty annoying.DIMENSIONS.You should play this game on the biggest screen you have because on higher difficulties tiles will get really small.SAVE GAME.There's no way to save the game, meaning you have to complete the puzzle you're working on or you will lose the progress on that puzzle. This is definitely odd as it might result a useless feature to use with the first puzzle but becomes very useful in the latest ones that might take long time to complete (almost two hours for the final one)I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840M/Intel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64"

Worse is that this could have been easily avoided. The puzzle pieces, when not on the board, float around. On top and under one another. When you see a piece you want to pick up, it will grab every single other piece first, and by the time you've cleared out all the pieces around it, it has moved under a new bunch and you have to continue on clicking pieces you don't want. This is NOT an exaggeration. And it doesn't matter if it's at the very top of all the other pieces. I clicked over 40 pieces (I counted) before finally picking up the one I wanted. This, coupled with the fact that two pieces will not stick to one another (as they would in real life) unless they are in their final position, makes it very annoying to put pieces together just to move them again one by one when you find where they're supposed to go. Fix these two things, and it'll be the perfect jigsaw puzzle game. Currently, I cannot recommend."

Consider the conclusion pf this review if you are thinking of buying it for the full price.First, let me say this; I am extremely addicted to all kinds of jigsaw puzzles. I have completed at least 50 different jigsaw puzzles which have 1000+ pieces, including the former world record 24,000 piece puzzle. I have played endless amount of different jigsaw puzzle Flash games I've found on the internet. I often see myself doing jigsaw puzzles in my dreams. Hell, while trying to fall asleep, eyes closed, I see myself connecting puzzle pieces.So, using my experience as a source of opinion, what I think the game is:Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a jigsaw puzzle game which1) does NOT let you connect pieces with each other, instead you have to connect the pieces to the field2) the playing field has the exact same size as the puzzle itself, so you have no extra space and the field can get crowded quite fast3) does NOT let you rotate the pieces, which in my opinion, takes away quite a lot of fun4) has the pieces floating around in a tub, causing the player to pick up the wrong one even if youdid not misclick (when pieces are stacked it does not always take the piece from the top layer)5) has an extremely ridiculous storyline and not in a good way.6) is not much better than some of the free Flash jigsaw puzzle games found onlineSo why do I still recomment it? Because (besides the fact that I'M ADDICTED TO THESE TYPES OF GAMES; SEND HELP), the theme of the game is relaxing, all the pictures are spectacular and tolerable to put together. I myself prefer to hear my own playlists, but as much as I've listened to the game sound it is calming and when the game starts to frustrate me, the audio helps me chill down. And I'm not sure why, but if a game has achivements I immideatly consider buying it, so if you're into that one can get quite a fast 100%, if they have some nerve.All in all, this game has a common playstyle like most of the Flash games found online, that are free, but what makes it stand out is the atmosphere of the game. For the full price I would not recommend this game since you can take any free game found online and listen to some Zen music on the background and get pretty much the same feeling, but 2€ is not that much for the actual feeling. I do not regret my decision of buying this game."

I bought it when it was on a 90% sale and it gave me around 11 hours of gameplay (without repetition). What I like about this game is that the difficulty increases as you do the set of 20 puzzles. There is however one very frustrating outlier - puzzle nr 12. Across the levels, the puzzles pieces vary in their shapes (e.g. some have ""spears"" poking out, others are curved) which keeps them interesting. I like the Japanese music and theme and I absolutely love that you, the monk, grow a beard and your hair turns grey the further you get into this game. Now with all of this being said there are 2 big issues with this game. First of all, there isno save feature! I had to leave my computer running overnight to complete a puzzle, because I simply didn't have 2-3 hours straight (and patience) to complete it. Secondly, the puzzle pieces keep moving on your screen, meaning that you will end up picking up the same piece a dozen of times, without wanting to do so, simply because it's on top of others/in the way. All in all, I would recommend grabbing this game when it's on sale and if the negative aspects don't bother you."

Overall, with achievements added and how long it's going to take you to finish some of these harder puzzles as you go through the levels, this game is worth its price.

,Not Recommended,284950,19834254,"Posted: 21 December, 2015",all,Azghouls,"Computer puzzle games have been around for a long while – well as far as I can remember. My earliest knowledge is called ‘European Scene Jigsaw Puzzles Vol. 1’ by Thorn EMI UK way back in 1981.  A nice game with crisp graphics amid the moderate choice of colours, it served its purpose. Fast forward to April 2014, another puzzle game caught my attention which happens to be in the form of this review – Pixel Puzzles: Japan. What attracted me to this game is the theme (Japan) that plays upon the ‘traditional’ puzzle gameplay. Well, once I have knocked out all the puzzles, this puzzle game leaves a lot to be desired.So let’s start off with the good points first. This puzzle game certainly does have a traditional Japanese feel with the puzzle borders filled with water and floating Lilly pads – that is the Koi Pond. Also there’s a carp swimming about where you can actually can catch it. Place the carp on the puzzle board and he’ll fishtail back (excuse the pun) to the pond. There are other things you can do to the carp however I let you discover it (and no, you cannot eat it).There are nineteen puzzles to choose from and the pieces range from sixty to the granddaddy three hundred and fifty. I guess the puzzle purists won’t considering three hundred and fifty large however, in this game, it’s the largest. The puzzle pieces are not your ‘traditional’ piece as most have weird shapes to them. In addition to this, you cannot refer to the puzzle picture at all as there’s an additional ‘feature’ where you need to unlock - the ‘Power of the I-Ching’.The way this works is that there’s a golden ‘Yin Yang’ piece randomly placed in the puzzle. Once you place the piece on the random placement, you unlock one part of the I-Ching. Do this eight times you can use its power. The power is the reveal the actual picture for a short moment or two and that’s about it. Talking about a buzz killer aye. I guess the developers needs something ‘authentic’ to enhance this game.And now here comes the unpleasant parts. First thing is this I-Ching concept – personally it’s just a waste of feature as the puzzles are all quite easy to do. Granted some are a little difficult however for me, the I-Ching is just a gimmick that can do without. Secondly, you can go crazily clicking on every part of the canvas until the piece slots in as there’s no penalty to do so. Also, because the game forces the pieces to slot in nicely, it takes away the fun of building ‘mini canvases’ all over the board.Third, you cannot rotate the pieces so every piece is the right way up so it’s making this easy puzzle game even easier to play. Fourth, there’s no save feature so you cannot park the puzzle to take a little rest and fifth, there’s a bug where, when you try to grab a puzzle piece from the pond, there’s a good chance that you will select another piece close to it instead of the one you have chosen. I think the reason behind this is the puzzle's algorithm. It’s designed that, if there’s a couple of pieces bunched up together, the algorithm selects the piece that represents the north western corner of the picture first and finally, south eastern corner last.Yet there’s two more that really grips me the most. The first being the quality of all the pictures. I presume they are the developer's photos however, all the pictures are extremely low quality. This is an absolute no-no as, being a puzzle game, its primary objective is to provide the user high quality pictures. The second is the abysmal sounds – the background music is nothing more than a short musical scores that loops over and over again. Also the sound quality, just like the photos are abysmal – very low quality; so low you can even hear the hissing sound. At least they could have bought a decent microphone or maybe remove the hissing sound from the original recording.Other than completing the puzzles, there’s an extra feature where you can view the gallery and see who made this game (without the dart board). There’s also two additional puzzles to complete at any time as, I believe are the free DLC for this game – another words, you don’t have to unlock them. So being a ‘traditional’ puzzle game is nothing more than a farce. With so many negatives, it’s a wonder why I completed all the puzzles. Actually the main reason why I did is because of the achievements. If there wasn’t any, this puzzle game will be ditched straight into the bin, figuratively speaking.3 / 10"

When that times comes for you, stear clear from this one.The music isn't bad. The weirdly cut puzzle pieces aren't bad. The pictures aren't bad. The idea of the moving/floating puzzle pieces, while strange at first, isn't bad, theoretically. It doesn't allow easy organization of the pieces, and basically asks you to go about it one piece at the time. That could potentially have made the puzzles harder, but in an interesting way.Here's the problem: If you are basing the whole concept of your take on a traditional game on a mechanic that doesn't work, you are doing it wrong. And the ""floating pieces"" idea doesn't work, because the click detection on these floating pieces simply doesn't work. The game consitently fails to recognise the piece you click on, even when it is clearly on top of every other piece and you clearly click in the middle of the piece. The detection rate is so horrible, that it makes the game frustrating. It's plain and simple flawed execution of the main game mechanic.That aside, there is a rather limited number of puzzles (16 or so?), probably finishable in under 8 hours (many of my hours up there are just idling). The lack of any type of save function is another fatal flaw.So, no, this isn't a good puzzle game in any way. Get it really, really, really cheap with really low expectations."

They stay fixed in that position also, so you already know you got the puzzle piece at the right spot.3) The shapes of the pieces are so easily distinguishable that you don't even have to look at the overall picture to arrange them together.What's fun about puzzle games? Not knowing which direction the puzzle piece goes, not knowing where to put it and having the joy of finally fitting one with the other after a long time of ""puzzling"".

The only preview you get is in the selection screen and very small. In order to see the full-sized picture, you first have to place enough pieces correctly and fill up the bar on the right, then you get a glimpse at the picture for a few seconds.

Let me describe to you what is so irritating. The play area is made up of a table which you assemble the puzzle pieces on and there's a river/pool along the left and top edge of the screen that the unused pieces float around in. Now in the early levels where there's less pieces and the pieces are larger this pool is fine and works great. However, when you progress and the pieces become smaller and more of them it's almost impossible to click on the piece you need. The majority of the time spent on this game has been trying to click on a piece I need and picking up pieces that my cursor isn't even touching. I wish this game wasn't digital so I could flip the table over.Now if you can get passed the irritating pool the game is fine and enjoyable. It's a jigsaw puzzle game. You piece the puzzle together and you complete the puzzle. It's as simple as that and done well in that regard."

But it doesn't come without it's share of problems that distract from the overall enjoyment of the game.First to deserve mention is the inability to save your progress (at least, I could not find any such feature or mechanic anywhere).  If you start building a puzzle, you need to commit to finishing it.  For the earlier puzzles that have fewer pieces this is not a problem.  But getting along to the more advanced puzzles with a lot more pieces, it takes one quite a while to complete a puzzle, which you now have to do in one sitting.Which leads me to the second distraction.  When building a puzzle, all of the available pieces are floating along the left and top sides of the screen.  You pick a piece up from these areas and drag them onto the puzzle for placement.For early puzzles this is easy.  However, once the puzzles get to have 100+ pieces, the areas get a bit crowded and picking up a piece becomes a mini-game in itself.  A frustrating one at that.You can clearly see a piece floating about that you wish to pick up, but click on it and somehow you will have picked up a piece underneath it or floating off to the side of it.  Sometimes it takes up to 10 tries just to pick up the piece you want.And dropping an unwanted piece results in all of the pieces around the drop point to disappear and reappear somewhere else.  Thus, you sometimes inadvertently lose the piece you actually want, because you dropped an unwanted pick-up on top of it.Lastly, there are only 21 puzzles to build.  Once you've built them all, the game is pretty much over unless you wish to re-build a certain puzzle.These are some minor niggles and personal experiences that shouldn't detract from the overall game, but I feel are worth mentioning.If you like building puzzles, you should give Pixel Puzzles: Japan a go.  If you like building puzzles but get frustrated easily, I'd lay caution in the road as you might fall to pieces while trying to pick up the pieces...."

The finished puzzle images look gorgeous and the harder ones are quite satisfying to accomplish. The one song that plays during the game is fairly decent, but some people may find it annoying after awhile. Luckily, there is an option to turn off the sound. The price isn't too bad, although I did purchase it when it was on sale, and as of now there are 21 different puzzles to play. The developers did mention ""multiple free bonus puzzles"" so there might be more to come in the future.My only two complaints are that having the puzzle pieces constantly moving around makes it frustratingly difficult to grab the one that you want, so you may have to take out a few pieces before getting a certain one. My other complaint is that there seems to be no way of saving my progress on a puzzle so I can come back to it later. It's not really a big deal with the smaller, easier puzzles, but once you get up to 220 pieces and beyond, it can be a pain to have to assemble the entire puzzle in one go.Despite those issues I mentioned, this is a lovely puzzle game. I highly recommend it to any jigsaw puzzle fans looking for something to unwind and relax with."

To fully enjoy the game, players should probably also like games that require catching something that is moving with a click of the controller...or fishing games. There are, however, a few points that could be polished up:- The mouse pointer is not very accurate and sometimes sluggish.- The game lacks a true working space to organize selected puzzle pieces. (If you accidentally put the right piece in the right place on the board the piece will lock down, so it's a bit risky - and un-fun - to only have the puzzle board to place various fished-out pieces.)- You can catch the koi...but it does nothing.- There's no save option. Be prepared to have enough time to complete the puzzle when you sit down to play (most don't take *that* long) or to leave the game running in the background when something comes up.- The speed of the flow in the puzzle piece ""pond"" is not adjustable. When combined with mouse accuracy issues, clicking for puzzle pieces can be fairly random.- The pieces get smaller as the number of pieces increases...which, at times, made me feel like I might go blind. (Playing on laptop.)The above list seems like a lot of things that can be improved, I know. And if any of the above would drive you bonkers, then maybe this game won't be a good choice for you. However, if the above points won't ruin your gaming experience and you love puzzles/puzzling games, then I reccomend playing Pixel Puzzles: Japan."

No saving--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. You cannot connect pieces together that you know should fit to make sections. This game makes you pretty much work from the sides and then crawl from there. You might think well isn't that is how people do puzzles? Yes, but when you do these, when you see other pieces can join up with each other, you can start piecing them together and save them aside for the bigger picture. This game does not allow to do so. The way it works is that pieces will only 'fit' on the board if they are on the eaxact location, so if you were really bored.... you could grab each piece click drop over the board till u find it locked in place.........2. Mouse aiming. Terrible in this game, you end up half the time picking up other pieces instead of the one you want. If you then, proceed to drop this piece ontop of your desired piece, then enjoy searching for it again from the spawn pool as for some odd reason they decided to add an effect which pretty much makes the dropped piece bomb the other pieces as well to make them disappear. The ""HD"" graphics don't even feel HD at all.... more like low res and the scaled up... Hell.... MSN jigsaw puzzles where more HD than this.....3. Floating pieces, I didn't mind it at the start but then it got annoying. Each time you pick a piece, you can drop it back in the water and it disappears and goes back to the 'spawn point'. At first it was nice, but with the terrible mouse aiming, there is a good chance that you will be chasing a piece for a good minute (and hope it is not near the spawn are, because then all the other pieces you dropped will just reappear there).4. No save?! Forced to play the whole puzzle until completion? Alright...... I don't see that happening with other jigsaw puzzles I do..... I don't see some elf scrambling the whole board at night to wake up to see my puzzle reset."

For being a game that is supposed to be 'zen', it has some features that make it pretty frustrating, particularly when doing puzzles with more pieces. At first, the game starts out being pretty relaxing, but as the game continues, the pieces floating around get smaller and smaller. This makes it hard to see what's on them sometimes, but that wouldn't be a problem in itself.The main problem is that once there gets to be more pieces, it's incredibly difficult to get the piece you actually want, especially before it floats under another clump of pieces. Even if the piece is on top, it feels like more often than not, whenever you click, it will select a random piece from within a centimeter or so radius. And forget about just dropping the piece and trying again - when you drop a piece, it takes itself and all the pieces around it back to the single spawn point in the water for the pieces. Soon, all the pieces will be all clustered together there and you'll basically just need to pile all the pieces up on your playing board if you want any of them, espeically a specific one.It would be nice to be able to actually select only the piece you are clicking on. It would also be very helpful not to have a piece go back to the spawn point when setting it down and have it actually stay where you set it. The ability to turn off the floating of the pieces would also be useful, particularly once they get pretty small.Another feature that this game is lacking that I've seen on free puzzle games is the ability for pieces to 'stick' to their neighboring pieces. Basically in this game, pieces only lock into place on the actual board. Even if you find two pieces that obviously go together but don't know where to put them yet, they will stay as separate pieces. It would be really nice if the pieces could click together and then be moved together. Maybe the developers didn't want to include this feature on purpose and I could see where having large chunks of pieces already stuck together would clutter up the board, but maybe it could be a feature that players could choose to turn on or off.Despite these annoying flaws, the game still does have some pros, including nice pictures and pretty neat edge styles that vary from puzzle to puzzle. It is a fun game, but it would be a lot less of a headache with the addition of the features I mentioned earlier. Because of the problems and the shortness of the game, I would have to NOT recomend the game at it's full price - $7 is too much when there are plenty of free puzzle games on other sites. If the game is ever on sale for $4 or less, then I would recommend picking it up if you're interested."

It has a wide range of puzzles with pastoral scenes of rural to ancient Japan that individually range from ho-hum to downright beautiful. The puzzles go from 'easy' 60pieces to what I would call 'journeyman' 250pieces.The setting is weirdly enough chinese... As you solve a puzzle, a chinese monk is pondering the I-ching and as you successfully place the pieces of your puzzle, he achieves enlightenment which gives you the chance to tap into this enlightenment to see a representation of the completed puzzle.The puzzle difficulty is tiered and you only unlock the next tier by levelling up your monk which you achieve by completing a set number of puzzles in a given tier. The way it is set up gives the impression that you can go your own way, but the only freedom you have is by deciding which puzzle in a tier you want to do first.The puzzle-screen is workmanlike and efficient, which I like. The screen's layout successfully focuses your attention to the part where you work on your puzzle. There's no information on the screen that can grab your attention away from the puzzle. No weird animated stuff, no dancing gibbies, no unasked for anime-crap (which the developers could easily have fallen for, I admire their restraint.).The music is light and unintrusive, though I must echo the complaints about the waterdrip garden-ornament. I never experienced the old sound-effect as it was patched before I bought Pixel Puzzles: Japan, but it still serves to shatter my concentration now and then. I would like to see an option to disable/enable the waterdrip garden-ornament so that players who don't want the sound-effect can play the game without it.Bordering the puzzle-table is a koi-pond in which the pieces float around. I guess the idea is that the player is rummaging around in there with their hands to grab a piece. I think it's a fun idea, but it doesn't translate well once in the game and trying to fish out the piece that you want can be a source of mild annoyance.Though the developers did went the extra mile here. For a cute laugh, catch the Koi and drop it on the puzzle-table. ^^The actual completing of the jig-saws is fundamentally flawed though. The pieces don't snap together, but they individually snap to the grid. This means that you can't make clusters like you can when you piece together a real jig-saw. I think that this is a glaring oversight.Secondly, it makes it extremely easy to cheese completion of a jig-saw as you can move a random piece around until it snaps in place, made even easier because the snap-to-grid mechanic is very forgiving. I have oftenly seen that I pushed a random piece aside only to have it snap to the grid!Another thing that missed the intended goal I guess is the form of the pieces. Though the developers probably thought that the sometimes outlandish shapes would make the puzzles harder, (did they recognize the problem with the snap-to-grid action too?), it actually achieves the opposite. I oftenly found myself looking for a specific shape rather than trying to find a piece that graphically matched the picture. The weird shapes make it too easy to piece together the bane of every jig-saw fanatic; large sections of clear blue sky.There is no scoring in Pixel Puzzles so completing a puzzle without using the monk's enlightenment goes unrewarded. Pixel Puzzles further does not block the computer from falling asleep, or to start the screensaver. Pixel Puzzler also doesn't believe in tooltips so it isn't readily clear what a button does unless you click on it to find out.While I do like the game an sich, as it does exactly what it says on the tin and nothing more or less, which with today's games is somewhat of a blessing as it has been a while since I've bought a game that did what is promised, I dislike the fact that when it comes to piecing together a jig-saw, Pixel Puzzler fails. The snap-to-grid action as opposed to fitting pieces together, coupled with the fact that with the weird shapes the piecing together is nothing but a 'find the weird shape that fits another weird shape affair', works to render the game alltogether too easy and robs the player of a challenge.Still a fun game that provides a good diversion and most certainly not overpriced. But it fails where it matters and that's a shame."

Some how this game manages to screw up both.The snap to grid is ridiculously loose, and does not require *any* adjacent peices, making it a common occurrence to set a piece down and have it magically jump into a position you had not yet identified. Brute forcing tricky areas by picking-up-dropping-picking-up-dropping until it snaps is way to easy to do... trains you quickly to play by trial-and-error not analysis.If that was all, I'd still give this game a thumbs up. Sadly, the peice-selection interface is broken beyond hope. You spot a peice, you mouse directly over it, you click, and... you get randomly one of the thirty closest peices. On the latter puzzles it is virtually impossible to pick up a specific peice without 10-20 attempts. I can't express how frustrating this is. Completely game breaking.

When it gets crowded with a lot of pieces in the more difficult, larger puzzles at the end of the game, you very rarely grab the piece you are clicking on.

One needed to be rotated and the second time the piece shape needed to be flipped (the negative size needed to be on the right and the positive side needed to be on the left). The third time, there wasn't a final piece, the game somehow made one piece just disappear. I grabbed the fish a million times to try and see it if was stuck, searched the river and corners, I clicked all over the completed puzzle to make sure it wasn't just hidden on the board, but alas, it was nowhere.I also find it to be frustrating when trying to grab a specific piece and it grabs every single piece other than the one I have selected. I usually get around this by only selecting pieces that are on the top since they are not as crowded.I cannot recommend this to anyone who is a completionist, like me, due to the fact that sometimes you cant complete the puzzle unless you restart. I still purchased this despite a review saying they didn't recommend this, but it was less than a dollar. However, once I experienced these bugs, I found myself wondering how in the world something could be so badly designed that pieces dont fit/ are missing.Either way, I think this is a great idea and it is relaxing (until you experience said bugs).

A nice theme, some pretty challenging puzzles later on, but there are just too many small annoyances that make you think: 'why didn't the developers fix this? They surely must have played their own game?'These are the things that make a possibly calming game into an occasional teeth grinder:Puzzles can't be saved mid-game. So when you have been playing Pixel Puzzles while waiting for something to finish downloading you can't save your current state of the puzzle. This destroys the whole casual nature of the game. It's either finish the puzzle or start the puzzle over the next time. And with pretty masive puzzles in later levels, that's just not cool.The puzzle pieces literally float around a fish pond that surround half the puzzle field. In later levels the amount of pieces increases. This also makes the puzzles pieces very, very small. It becomes quite hard to see them and properly discern them from one another. And to add to the problems with this...The mouse pointer is incredibly inaccurate. Imagine wanting to click-drag a puzzle piece from the pond onto the table, and having to click six or seven times, because the pointer keeps picking up pieces besides the one you want. Oh, and remember that the pieces float around? Yeah, terribly annoying.The sound is supposed to add to the meditative, monastery-like atmosphere of the game. Too bad the sound quality is pretty low and several sound effects have a slight static to them when they play.For €6,99 there's just too many obvious things unnecessarily working against the player. Around €2 would be acceptable and I then would also recommend the game, because the puzzles are challenging and have a pretty big 'just one more puzzle before bed' feel about them."

A game where you actually put pieces of a picture together so you can form a whole picture.The game starts out with big, simple pieces so you can solve the puzzles easily, as well as help you get started with how the game is played. As you move on to the next level, the pieces get smaller as well as having to deal with more pieces at one time.My only real complaint is that you can't put pieces together to make a whole piece and then try to place that whole piece in the spot it belongs. You have to ""know"" where each piece goes on the board. So the point is you have to find where the piece goes on the board without being able to make clusters of pieces.Overall a very good idea for people who are into ""puzzle"" games.

,Not Recommended,284950,14950484,"Posted: 18 March, 2015",all,glenmcd[AUS],"Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a jigsaw puzzle game that is delivered on Steam and works on Windows.  That's the good.  You can finish puzzles.  That's good too.  Now for the bad:1. Lack of realism: having pieces constantly moving about in a pond is a terrible idea.  You don't get time to really look at any particular piece, and it's near impossible to pick up the piece you want.  It's easy to pick up a piece, just not the piece you want.  And if you drop the piece you don't want and it's near the piece you want, the piece you want dissapears, perhaps showing up later somewhere else.  This is not just a bad idea for enjoyment of game, it's bad in that it makes my eyes hurt after a while.  It's like trying to catch a small fish with a large net in a pond that's crowded with many other fish, and all fish are swimming about randomly and at high speed.2. Short lived.  There's 21 puzzles using five difficulty levels.  No, that doesn't mean 21x5=105 combinations, as particular puzzles (pictures) has a preset difficulty which can't be changed.  When finished these, there's nothing more to do, except perhaps do the same again.  You gotta be kidding.3. The essential challenge of solving a jigsaw puzzle has been eroded.  You can solve any puzzle without even looking at each piece, simply by test-dropping each piece at random places on the canvas.  The tolerance level is high, and so at least in the lower difficulty levels, if you place a piece on the canvas for the purpose of taking out of the dreaded pond, there's a good chance that you'll place it close enough to where it's supposed to go and that it will instantly and permanently click into the correct spot, even if it's the first piece to do so and even if it's near centre of canvas.  Good game design not only means allowing intended solutions, it should also include preventing unintended solutions, particularly when they don't add to the fun.If you want a decent jigsaw puzzle game, I'm afraid at the moment you may have to look beyond Steam.  I've purchased ""Jigsaw Puzzle Platinum Edition"" by ""RealOne Arcade"" for $20 (above game was $7) and it's allowed me to feel okay with offering the above critical review.  It's hard to criticize when there isn't anything better available.  If I had my time over, I'd buy JPPE only, knowing that there's nothing in :Japan that I'd miss."

Reading the forums, this has been a bug for a long time and has never been fixed (that's really bad as it should have never even be this crap)... But as another user says, the easiest is with these 220 puzzles, to not drive you insane, is to just put the wrong piece on a pile on the edge of the board and dump them later back into the pond..Mind you this only seems to happen with the 220 puzzles, all the others don't really seem to have this problem.Another minor point is the two extra 220 puzzles above and below the 350 one, if you finished them, they stay greyed out..I bought this when it was on sale for 1.40 euro, and I think that's a good price, but I can't recommend it full price due to the annoying bug (and the fact the developers haven't fixed it even though they have released a couple of other pixel puzzles after that one)."

In this one, you have all the pieces floating around randomly in the water and when you put enough specific pieces in place, you can get a brief preview of what the finished image is supposed to be.For most of the puzzles, this is all fine and dandy. However, when you get to the last few puzzles that are over 200 pieces, trying to find that piece that you're looking for floating in that mess is quite annoying. And then, I don't know how, but somehow the computer knows what piece you're going after and gives you every other piece BUT the one you're going after. It'll even give you a piece that's not where you're clicking, only near it.Another thing that I didn't care for in this title is the method that the pieces snap into place. On this one, the pieces snap to the board. I much prefer that the pieces snap to each other since it makes it easier to see if you got any pieces laying around on the board when you're wondering what the hell you did with the last few pieces.One thing I really did like about this was the interesting ways the pieces were cut. It made the puzzles seem more unique and fun.It took me about 13 hours to go through all of this. My overall rating lands just on the not recommended side."

,Recommended,284950,17389033,"Posted: 4 August, 2015",all,Todd Marshall,"""Pixel Puzzles: Japan"" is what you would expect from a puzzle game, except for some mismatches in the programming neclecting to some extend the variety of reality puzzles and score lines such as time tables as well as Multiplayer competition.To start with statistics, they simply do not exist, though it would be wishful to see at least your best time and perhaps a score line corresponding to weight functions of the puzzle parts.Another missing is Multiplayer Mode, and of course, one can easily imagine how attractive this gane could become with such an institution installed in accordance to the standards.The reality comparision may not be totally appropriate, but it's noteworthy to recognize that you cannot rotate the puzzle parts, i.e. they are always preset to insert. An additional rotation (the function of the right mouse button is not in use in this game), perhaps combined with an additional difficulty level (there is only one level explicitly given), would surely make this game more interesting.So, then, after explaining the need of some expansion pack to justify the price (at the moment 70% off would do), what is positive about this game? Answer: It's the shaping of the puzzle parts combined with the variety of motifs, which evoke different strategies of solvation. Thereby, strategies can be chosen according to the color (motif) and the shape of the puzzle parts, especially orientated towards the border parts of the puzzle. Together with the number of puzzle parts, these three ingredients, as functions of the motif, determine a certain level of difficulty. For example, a temple of 112 parts with clear shaped lines and strict color changes could be said to be of an easier handling than a picture of a Sakura branch of 250 parts, where you are left alone with the almost one colored Sakura blossoms. Therefore, the need of concentration in solving a puzzle applying some sorts of strategy makes it clear that this game can be of some interest, generally speaking."

I haven't enjoyed a puzzle game in a long time.The sound becomes a bit anoying but there is an option in the setting to mute it. Sometimes it's a bit hard to get the piece you click on, which means it will give you a complete different piece than you have focused on, but if you really like puzzle games, you get used to it after a while.Also on the hardest difficulty i recommend to change the background colour to see the pieces better."

Nothing more, but also nothing less!The images are nice and assembling the tiles is just relaxing. Just fire it up when you need to calm down and want to let your mind wander. A minor grievance is that picking up the tiles in the water is sometime not as precise as you want it to be and you end up picking the wrong tile 3 times in a row.If you are looking for some easy achievements, this game provides 26 of them. Just play through the game and earn all of them without hassle.Especially on sale it is really worth the price. For the regular price it might be close call, but if you get it on sale (currently 85% off), you can't go wrong!"

The Puzzles are in a japanese theme and you will have to move a puzzle piece on the board to make sure that all pieces will fit in order to complete the puzzle. You will gain some ""power"" after placing the correct puzzle pieces on the board. Filling the entire power bar will grant you an ability to temporary reveal the entire puzzle for a short time.Music pops up every 10 seconds and then plays for the next 5 seconds. Which is very annoying.You might pick up the wrong puzzle piece as they keep overlapping each other.Calm game.You can toggle the sound ingame.You can toggle the fullscreen/windowed ingame.Able to change the color of the Puzzle board.There are around 21 puzzles available.Ability to temporary reveal the entire puzzle once enough power.Other things.You are able to pick up a (mid) puzzle piece to place it on the puzzle board. If you have placed the puzzle on the correct spot it will fit and stay on the board even if this is impossible to know as you board might be completely empty.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10"
