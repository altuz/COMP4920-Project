,Recommended,284970,12254316,"Posted: 26 September, 2014",all,ShaggyMoose,"Anyone rememberZone 66? It was one of my favourite top-down ""sandbox"" shooters from the early 90s. This game harkens back to that era, both in terms of difficulty and gameplay. Be warned that if you are not experienced at this type of game and in particular, twinstick shooters, even on easy you will find this game an exercise in frustration. It is quite unforgiving...- Missions last between twenty minutes and an hour and there are no checkpoints! Run out of lives, back to the start.- Power ups seem to drop at times when you either don't require them (two repairs when I am already at full health, really?), or when it is practically impossible to pick them up without being destroyed. They don't hang around that long either.- Enemies fire from offscreen, many projectiles will track you for a long time and later enemies lean towards a bullet-hell style. These traits combine to make the airspace very crowded and sitting still for even a moment will be enough to make you very dead.This is where the game really shines; the flawless control and responsive movement of your ship make it a joy to play. It is possible to avoid practically anything, using a good sense of placement and understanding from which direction the next salvo of enemy fire is likely to approach. Unfortunately, the lack of on screen prompts and lacklustre radar make this heavily reliant on the player's intuition. Irrespective of that, there is a real sense of skill and reward, both for careful and ballsy play styles.There are a decent variety of enemies that are slowly introduced as the game progresses. There are both air and ground targets, which need to be destroyed with an appropriate weapon, similar to bothZone 66andXevious. Each enemy variant represents a particular threat and they do force certain responses to deal with them. When you get many types mixed together, the game is at its most difficult and hectic. There is an experience system that awards points at level-up. These points can be used between missions to upgrade your ship. However, even fully upgraded your fire power always feels underwhelming. Players are better off focussing on upgrades that increase agility; this is the main means by which you will stay alive!Throughout, the graphics are decent and manage to keep up a good frame rate on a mid-spec machine. Enemy designs are standard fare and borrow from just about everywhere, but provide good variety. Explosions in particular are pleasing to the eye. Sound is a little bland, but does the job.A few minor technical issues cropped up while playing...- I was unable to confgure my Logitech F310 gamepad. Trying to change the controls in either mode (XBox 360 or F310 Direct Input) just didn't work. I ended up using the default XBox 360 control scheme, which did the job. You are basically forced into a twinstick control scheme to make the game playable anyway.- Steam achievements didn't work. They are awarded as in-game medals, but the corresponding Steam achievement wasn't activated.- Enemies occasionally get stuck in the scenery and cannot be shot. Usually not too annoying, but once the enemy was an objective and I couldn't complete the mission.- I had only one crash to desktop in seven hours of play, which isn't too bad.In summary:This is an enjoyable but slightly repetitive game that rewards skillful play and will be appreciated by top-down shooter fans who arenotlooking for a quick fix."

Maybe some sort of warrning system that lets you know when an enemy behind you starts shooting, anything other than having to constantly look at the radar litterally every second."

It's like one of those amusementpark rides that just looks so god damn tempting, but you regret getting on 30 seconds after it starts moving.Or perhaps I'm just too old and boring.I remember spinny, fast and hectic top-down games for snes/nes that were near identical to this and they never came close to making me throw up on my keyboard/controller.If it takes a lot for you to get dizzy or feel sick, you'll probably love it.

,Not Recommended,284970,10046261,"Posted: 7 May, 2014",all,McCovican,"A bug-hunters wet dream. Horribly broken menus (not that you can actually access the options in-game, because apparently this is 1995) and the inability to even fix it yourself because the player configs are in encrypted binaries. Menus are both slow to respond, and hard-coded to use xbox360 controller icons, regardless of control preference (oh yeah and the controls menu causes the game to grind to a halt). Which is probably just there to foreshadow the fact that the mouse controls in-game are abysmal and pretty much unusable. The ship will continue to rotate long after you've actually stopped making any input with the mouse, regardless of sensitivity settings - high sensitivity only results in massive over-compensation from any input, and low sensitivity results in the feeling that you're stirring tar. The standard troubleshooting (vsync, pre-rendered frames, etc) will offer you no remedies here, this is all game mechanism.This could have the best gameplay in the world, but it's completely irrelevant thanks to an atrocious input interface with the user. Of course in reality, the gameplay is nearly as poor; it's marred by the usual suspects - invisible walls (with enemies that can shoot at you through them, but you can't shoot back - oh and they can do this with some standard geometry too), backtracking and just painfully bland & repetitive gameplay.4/10"

76561198004897476,Not Recommended,284970,28560600,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,Traskelion,"Project Root is sort of an open-area arcade shooter that feels like it came from the 90's.  I was enticed by what I saw, bought it on sale, and merrily jumped in.  20-ish hours later (which was in Offline Mode and thus not displayed here), I was done waiting for it to become worth my time OR money.  It's got a good arcade-y feel to it, the objectives are (most of the time) clearly marked, and the game DOES work as intended.  HOWEVER....it is heavily marred, and I shall focus on those details.The English is sloppy.  Even one as pedantic as I can forgive the occasional mistake, but this is pre-high-school level, and it grates on me.  Some of this is presented in pre- or post-mission cutscenes that alternate between two ugly character stills and an uninteresting story poorly presented through text.  The rest of this mess is given by all the text frequently sprawled across the bottom during the action.  This is distracting at best, and often meant I had to back away from all combat to catch what was going on before the text rapidly vanished.And the controls....I don't know about keyboard/mouse, but I played this on a controller, and it was not fun.  There is never a need to stop shooting.  You should be shooting during the majority of the time.  You need to be holding down a button to shoot.  These missions are upwards of 20 minutes each.  That makes 20 minutes or more of holding down a button more-or-less constantly, which gets uncomfortable, and the ensuing cramps disuaded me from that third mission in a sitting.But what about aside from that, what about the gameplay?  Well, there are upgrades!  Upgrades that don't necessarily explain what they do.  ""Elite kit: Rockets"" doesn't tell me much.  And these felt minor, easily forgettable, and like the points on ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?""... didn't really matter.  Honestly, the game should've just left out the upgrades altogether.The view feels too zoomed in.  If you want to avoid getting shot from off-screen or rushing past an enemy nearly as soon as it appears, you need to keep your eyes OFF of the scenery and on your mini-map.  The shooting and the dodging just don't feel GOOD this way.Now, some of you may like the idea of infinitely respawning enemies.  Keep the pressure on as you go for the objectives, right?  Well even that just feels clumsily done in Project Root.  I found one of the spawn points.  A ship appearing in air right in front of me, and another instantly appearing right in front of me as its predecessor died in fire.  I should not have been able to see that.  That aside, the constant enemy spawns are just an aggravating nuisance during the boss fights, which go on too long anyway.This game's graphics and settings are also subpar.  It felt a little sluggish on my quite-decent machine, despite not looking the part of a modern game.  Reducing the graphics settings yielded a result, and smooth play...but the distant background went from fog to black abyss.  A black abyss that sometimes swallowed or spit back out varioius terrain features of this background layer, based on which direction I was facing.  There's a difference between giving a game a more basic graphical style, and just poorly-executing your visuals.In short, if you want a budget version of a modern-day imagination of an older-style shoot-em-up that has a very open area, you could probably do worse than Project Root.  There's a gulf, however, in between that and a recommendation from me.  That gulf is hidden in a glitchy black abyss."

There are very few options available for any kind of tweaking - those that are there don't seem to have a lot of effect anyway.  The levels are way too long, with many ""primary"" objectives strung together one after another - by the time I reach the end of a level, my hands and arms are strained so bad that I can't continue.  I think each level could be split into two, or even three, separate parts - as it is, it makes the game more difficult than it needs to be, even on easy.One of the biggest flaws with the game is the fact that no achievements you earn will show up on Steam.  Reading through the discussions will show you that dozens, if not hundreds, of people have reported this issue but the game has long since been aboandoned by the devs in order to pursue their recently Greenlit game ""DOGOS"", which seriously looks like nothing more than an update of Project Root.While Project Root has all of the potential of a truly excellect twin-stick shooter, it feels like it's only 95% finished.  Sadly, that lack of polish and bug fixes makes this game not worth the $10 sticker price.  I paid $2.49 and I'm actually still disappointed.  If the devs come back and fix the issues with this game, I'll gladly change my review but, as it stands, I will not recommend it.  NOT RECOMMENDED."

Otherwise, I felt that the gameplay got very boring very quickly, with a boring upgrade system, uninteresting weapons, and very repetitive gameplay (is it dead yet? Circle strafe until it is!).The controls felt clunky, and as a result, the combat felt pretty bad as well. Dodging bullets felt harder than it should, and the camera makes it easy for you to get sniped from behind without knowing what was coming.Sound wise, this game felt like it had none. The soundtrack is so forgettable that I didn't notice when it wasn't playing. And get used to the horrid machine gun sample that they use for your main gun, cause that is pretty much the only noise this game has.I think this game has a story, but the dialogue that is supposed to fill it out only appears in small text at the bottom left of the screen, and goes by extraordinarily quickly, so when I was in the middle of trying to fight things, I couldn't read it at all, and as a result, I would often miss hints at objectives, making the game even more frustrating to play.TL:DRThis game is only for the most hardcore fans of the old strike series, or those of the shmup genre. Otherwise, I recommend a pass on this."

Well, it was a fairly new GPU (6 months maybe) and had worked flawlessly on every game. I installed this, didn't think to look at the forums (If I'm buying a full priced game then I do research but rarely for something that's a buck) installed and loaded up. Got into the tutorial and bam, had a black screen and the monitor turned itself off. Since that moment it's been doing it repeatidly until last week it decided to stop working completely.So, why blame this game again? After checking the forums the first time I had the black screen, I could see I was not alone, in fact many threads were claiming the very same thing. Perhaps it's been patched now, I don't know, I don't care, there was zero reason for my GPU to go (new but not so new it was faulty out the box, not old enough to go wrong, it was spotless with no dust, temps were 37 degrees idle and 45-50 on load...in fact, I could go on and on but I won't). The sad thing is, it even did a bit more damage than ""just"" my GPU but i'd be here forever explaining it.Perhaps it was just co-incidence that it decided to pack up then? Looking at the forums, I really doubt that, and after just double checking a minute ago, even more so.If it works for you? Great! Doesn't mean for one second though that there isn't an issue with the game and that it will work for someone else. It doesn't mean you're doing something right or the others are doing something wrong, it means that it's horribly optimised for different setups and you got lucky. I guess this is a problem with buying indie games.Was it 100% chance that it was this game that did it? No, I can't claim that for certain, but I do believe it and I can't in good faith recommend it to someone else for that reason.Be warned, and good luck to those who decide to risk their chances anyway. I think you would need to be unlucky for it to do what it did to me, but do check the forums before you purchase as general crashing to the desktop and freezes seem very common.(I can't review that actual gameplay because the game screwed up before getting a chance)"
