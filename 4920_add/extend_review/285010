,Recommended,285010,10435548,"Posted: 11 June, 2014",all,› Super Jelly Beans,"I just finished the game. If you like doing puzzle games and are also a fan of zombies,  I would recommend this game. The puzzles get progressivly challenging- with the hardest having 350 pieces. The pieces float around in a river which makes for a little challenge of grabbing the ones you need. I got a little frustrated clicking over and over and picking up the piece that was either overlapping or under the piece I wanted. Many pieces got away from me, but I eventually caught them. The puzzles are nicely drawn and one thing I really liked was that each puzzle had different shaped pieces. One had different suits as on each side- spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds. Another puzzle with a rapper zombie had words like SWAG as the edges of the pieces which made it interesting.The zombie shooter aspect of the game is fun, but I didn't find it as challenging as I expected it to be. The zombies come out one by one until the Z timer runs out. Then multiple zombies run out, but at a rather slower than desired pace. I was able to pick most of them off before they even reached my barricade. Most run in a straight line or at a slight slope.It would be nice to be able to change the difficulty level to up the zombie factor, either with more zombies, special zombies (currently, all zombies take 3 shots to kill), or zombies that run in zigzagging directions making them harder targets. I know the game is fairly new, so I'm looking forward to seeing what will be added to it. I'd also be interested in purchasing DLC puzzles. Lastly, Steam achievements would be the icing on the cake for this game."

It's basically what you see- you're completing a jigsaw, but to change things up a bit you also occasionally get attacked by zombies at the bottom right, so you have to think about your ammo and barricades etc. So that you don't die. It's fairly challenging, actually.The puzzles are nice and it doesn't have the problem of everything being a similar colour in the jigsaw, the art is pretty good, and it makes a nice change in the pace of the game when you suddenly get attacked by a horde of zombies.There's also an option when you start each jigsaw to turn off the zombies, in case you really don't want them.Also, the jigsaw pieces are shaped differently to the usual looking jigsaw pieces, which is an interesting idea and you have to think differently to how the pieces go together.It's an interesting idea, and I feel it works well.There also seem to be enough jigsaw puzzles to keep you busy and justify the price, and the devs are adding more for free.Reccomended :D"

This is a really clever concept, tying an action defense game in to a jigsaw puzzle mechanic, and I REALLY admire the concept - but its in total contrast to the other game in terms of tension, panic and ultimately frustration. I'll still play it, because of the novelty of it, and sometimes I like a buzz.If you like being under pressure, and you have a quick keen eye for puzzle pieces you might like this incarnation. If you're a dawdler and a person who does jigsaws for relaxation I'd say this probably isnt the right title - go and play the Pixel Puzzles Japan game instead."

The result is a mixture of half-baked ideas that could have been so much better.Mixing an action minigame with the patience-driven puzzle game just doesn't work. It doesn't help that the Tower Defense-esque portion is mediocre at best. You have a single straight lane were a few Zombies at a time come out and you can either place barricades to slow them down, mines to kill them or shoot/throw grenades to kill them. One problem here is, that you get the money to buy this stuff not from killed zombies but at random for correctly places puzzle pieces another, that as soon as a timer runs out, more and more Zombies come down the lane and you don't have much time to concentrate on the actual puzzle anymore.On the bright side, you don't have to play in this mode and can enjoy the puzzles taking all the time you want.That would be nice, if the actual puzzle game would be good.First the mechanics are totally off - it only checks the position of the tile against its right spot on the canvas and there's no possibility to connect tiles and move them around. Either you find the right spot and it gets locked or not. That's acceptable for minigames in larger games, but not for a standalone jigsaw game.Finding the right tiles is made ridiculously hard with all of them floating and moving around the edge all overlapping each other and not respecting screen borders. The tiles are a fraction of their actual size and the elaborated shapes are barely visible. If you finally spot a piece you want, the game does its very best to make it as hard as humanly possible for you to actually grab it. Even if the cursor is right over it and it's not overlapped itself or overlapping you will most likely grab another, presumably warped in from the other side of the screen.Apart from that the actual puzzles are too easy. The last one only has 350 pieces, the tiles can't be rotated and like mentioned before will just snap on get locked if they're in the right spot.If you're on the brink of frustation due to chasing a tile for literally a minute, you will start to notice something else. The badly looped, too short single piece of background music, the clunky controls of the action mini game and the uninspired pictures themselves.And then there is a third game within the game. The main menu is kind of a twin stick shooter zombies ... for whatever reason. But this comes with its own problems, like imbalances, weird hitboxes and a delay between triggering an action and the actual action, leading to you firing shots in whatever direction you're facing while it's performed and not the one where it it's supposed to go.Oddly enough the developer honours that gimmick with a good portion of the achievements, one for surving 60min and one for killing 5000 zombies - in one life, in one sitting, without pause - which takes around 100min. The actual distinguishing feature of the game - the tower defense - meanwhile only gets a total of 3 achievements, one of them for failing. The elephant in the room: is this reflectory of their priorities for this game?Anywho, if you enjoy jigsaw puzzles it might still be worth it for you. I spent around 6h on the 20 puzzles and did get some enjoyment out of it."

,Recommended,285010,20587812,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,Stefneh,"A fairly interesting twist on a classic game style.Decaying Logic have a series of these jigsaw games, each featuring a different theme. The theme for this one being a zombie apocalypse.They managed to incorporate the theme into the jigsaws by creating a tower-defense mini-game of sorts at the bottom of the puzzle. The aim is that you have to complete the jigsaw, but also keep your little character alive. You buy ammo and defenses with money you accumulate by placing pieces of the puzzle in the right places. If you fail to keep your character alive, you lose.This makes for an interesting twist on an otherwise quite relaxing genre of game. You need to manage your resources properly and make sure you are solving the puzzle fast enough for you to keep a steady amount of money in the bank for defenses. That added pressure can actually make the game more intense. Especially when you start getting to the later puzzles.There are 19 puzzles in total, ranging from 5 different levels of difficulty. Anyone who has played any of the others in the series will already know what the structure is like. The more difficult the level of puzzle is, the less of them there are in that level. For example, You will start with 6 easier puzzles to complete, then 5 slightly harder ones, then 4 harder ones again, then 3 then a big final one to complete.I quite enjoyed the uniqueness to this one, as from what i can see, the others in the series are pretty standard. With that said, this whole theme may be a little tedious for those who just want to relax and solve the puzzle in their own time.The art in this game is interesting, and a few of them actually made me think. There are certain scenarios that aren't really highlighted in zombie apocalypse stories and some of the art pieces in this, while a tad questionable, actually made me wonder (or just straight up say ""oh, that's messed up"").In terms of achievements, this one has a few that are quite tedious. Along with the puzzles, there is a main menu mini-game that involves you playing as your little character. Zombies home in from all angles and your aim is to just survive as long as you can.The tediousness in the completion of this game lays here. You have to 1) survive 60 minutes in that main menu mini-game and 2) kill an overall of 5,000 zombies in the main menu mini-game. Which, alas. Is mind numbing.I would go into details for tips and tricks for these achievements, but honestly, as there is not many guides on this game i am actually  tempted to just create one. So check for a guide if you need help, if not feel free to ask.All in all it was fun! It stressed me out a little and i would be lying if i said i wasn't looking forward to starting another one in the series that is less stressful.But still, it was an interesting one in the series and i would recommend it to anyone that wants a classic jigsaw game with a bit of a twist.TL;DR : A fun jigsaw puzzle game with a bit of a twist, definitely too try if you want something a little more unique that will put a bit of pressure on. But if you'd prefer to relax and solve the puzzles in your own time, maybe try another in the same series."

Either way, it's incredible!What's it all about? It's basically jigsaw puzzles with an undead theme to the pictures you have to assemble. To make things more interesting, it's also a zombie survival game. I can see the eyes popping out of your head in disbelief. It actually works surprisingly well. While you try to put together your jigsaw puzzle, you also have to keep an eye on the path at the bottom of the screen, ensuring the little man down there survives the zombie attacks. If he dies you have to restart the puzzle. He's only armed with a few bullets and grenades, but if you can assemble some pieces you'll be able to buy some more ammo soon enough.Freaky, huh?If that wasn't enough to lift your eyebrows clear off your face, there's a 'horde' timer as well. If you're fast enough with earlier puzzles you can avoid these, but later, bigger puzzles will see you defending against numerous zombie hordes. They can be easy, but distracting; yet it helps mix up the gameplay elements and stops you from falling asleep. Often you can get by letting the horde build up at a barricade, then set a tripwire bomb on all of them at once. Some might prefer the simple pleasure of a jigsaw puzzle without the additional complications - if this is you, you might want to steer clear of this game.The puzzles themselves are a mixed bag. Some are easy, others are made needlessly hard by having too much of the image one colour or texture. They're passable, but none of the images really jumps out at me as a favourite. The accompanying background music wasn't bad though, it has a good survival feel to it.Speaking of survival, it even has a minigame on the menu screen, where you must survive from a top-down perspective on a small patch of earth against zombies that continue to appear and attack from all sides. This game caps out at about 65 'menu zoms' on the screen at a time though, so it's kind of fun.Nothing like the threat of a zombie horde to make you jigsaw hard and fast! Worth getting just for the unique gaming experience."

Its easy and somewhat casual fun, not like a serious shooter or puzzle game. Each zombie takes three shots to pop, the waves are easy to take out, the weapons don't upgrade or change.Once I got down to the last four puzzles, it did seem to get a bit harder, but then the technical issues that were minor became impossible to surpass. For one, I couldn't manage to pick up the piece I was clicking on ever floating in the ether along the edges. The pieces that picked up when I clicked directly on one would be seemingly random. The edges of each piece somewhat appear as though they fit together, but often I was just throwing pieces at each other to see what stuck because some patterns were awkward.Overall though, I'd recomend it. The begining of it was a blast.

,Recommended,285010,22274793,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,JacquesLeSauve,"I'm going to be somewhat lazy here, and rather than detail this game in its entirety like I normally would for a write-up, I'll instead refer you to my review for its predecessor,Pixel Puzzles: Japan. For the most part the basic premise for the two games is the same. Just replace all the Japanese references with zombie related stuff and you're pretty much covered as far as the fundamentals go. Read that and you'll be up to speed with the rest of where this review is going. Go on, it's cool, I can wait...OK, so you've read it and now you know what the deal is with that game, right?...You haven't read it, have you? Well screw you, buddy. I'm just gonna carry on like you have anyway, so there!So while the core concept and gameplay from the previous game is in tact, as well as giving the game a new zombie themed facelift, they've also added a new element into the mix - zombie defense. The jigsaw board and floating puzzle pieces are still there doing their thing, but now there's a second game being played out at the bottom of the screen as well.A little shotgun-wielding dude stands in a small barricaded area at the bottom right corner of the screen and can be moved around his tiny hidey-hole with WASD, while zombies appear from the left corner and shamble their way toward our hero. Using the Space bar to shoot or Q to toss grenades, you must fend off the threat and survive long enough to complete each puzzle. Ammo and grenades are limited, but can be restocked using currency collected from correctly setting pieces into the board. This currency can also be used to briefly reveal the finished picture within the puzzle board or to purchase additional barricades or claymores which can be placed in pre-set locations along the zombie track at the bottom of the screen to give yourself some additional breathing room. Which you'll need, because a timer is also counting down to a hoard rush that will need all your attention to fend off. So it's a jigsaw puzzle game mixed with some management elements and a little zombie-shooting action.I love that they didn't just rest on their laurels, but instead really made the effort to add something fresh to the series. But what I love even more is that it's optional and you can turn off the zombie defence stuff at any point if you're not in the mood for it and just want to put a picture together. To be honest, that's what I ended up doing after a few rounds. Don't get me wrong, it's a really nice, competent extra, and I appreciate it being there, but it just wasn't what I was looking for. I came for the basics, so I was happy enough with that.Otherwise, this is almost exactly the same game as PP: Japan, both good and bad. The pieces can still be a pain to rummage out from the pile, but at least they're now going towards some far more interesting pictures this time. Though, that said, they don't hold back, and even though they're only cartoony illustrations, I could easily see how people who get a little squeamish around gore would feel a bit touchy about this. But other than that, this is a nicely put together, fun little time killer that's as laid back or demanding as you want it to be, and I can't wait to play the rest in the series.... You still haven't read that previous Pixel Puzzles review, have you?... Well screw you, buddy!"

It makes the game rather frantic as you're hurrying to grab a piece to fit so you can keep fighting.The nice thing is, if you don't like the frantic mess, you can always play without the zombie onslaught."

The kill 5000 zombies / 1 hour menu grind achievements were really out of place.Perfect game caused me physical pain having to spam Q for 1.5 hours + without a break.That said, the puzzle portion was what I expected and I am happy to have another perfect game on the list.So up-vote assuming you are willing to sit in the menu for over an hour or dont achievement hunt."

Some levels are infuriatingly unplayable. If you have the patience, then go for it."

There's no achievement for having it on, but there's plenty of achievements for playing the menu mini game. It literally makes no sense to me. Fail sauce."

I'll ocassionaly do online jigsaw puzzles, just to relax, as they are mostly mindless entertainment.  This game takes that activity to the next level.  The built in threat of the timer (not to finish the puzzle, but to get zerged by zeds) adds an element of suspense that's never been part of my jigsawing experience.  Also a great game if you're after a lot of quick and easy badges.  Wish there were more puzzles available (and there really needs to be a pause button for the menu game) but other than that, this game provides quite a few hours of pleasurable entertainment."

Nice soundtracks and zombie mode can be turned off for the main puzzle game if desired. However, the minigame caused me extreme eye strain, possibly developed carpal syndrome and more importantly, it broke my Q key on my keyboard, but definitely would nade some zombies again."

It is very challenging and gets harder as you go, but it is so fun.  The zombie defense addition to the game certainly adds an additional challenge to it and makes it more fun."
,Recommended,285010,23195170,"Posted: 24 May, 2016",all,Ravenquick,After playing and enjoying Pixel Puzzles Japan I decided to give this game a try and I'm glad I did.  They took the concepts in the Japan version and went further with a mini game to play while putting the puzzles together also there is a neat mini game on the menu screen which is fun in it's own right.  If you enjoy doing Jigsaw Puzzles but like me don't have the room at home to do a puzzle then this game is for you.

,Not Recommended,285010,21677759,"Posted: 6 March, 2016",all,Igor the Viking,"Interesting idea, terrible execution.- Hitboxes of the pieces are off: Every piece has an hitbox ""aura"" that makes selecting the one you actually want a nightmare;- Pieces don't attach to other pieces: I see clearly they fit together but cannot turn them into a ""block""- Pieces moving constantly is a strange design choice that caused more problems like:- Pieces getting stuck;- Layers not being respected: you click the one one top and get the one on the bottom;- If you click somewhere in the pieces area, those pieces ""get out of your way"", they reappear somewhere else, but this plus the hitbox and layer problems cause you to select the wrong piece and when you drop it, the piece you actually want is moved somewhere else;- Crappy menu minigame + achievements that make you play the minigame for an hour straight (it does not even have a pause button) and kill 5000 zombies, so after that one hour, add about 40 minutes more."
,Recommended,285010,34374427,Posted: 20 August,all,Tomtom,"Another good addition to the PP series, the UndeadZ game for me has that slight edge over the others. The reason being is the mini game you get to conquer and the achievement tied to that mini game. That being said, as fun as it is, it isnt easy, its actually the complete opposite to the main game itself, maximum concentration is needed. The main game is pretty much basic, decent puzzles, decent pictures, pretty box standard for the game that it is. Now, i'm off to tackle the next game in the series! 8/10"
