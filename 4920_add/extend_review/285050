76561197971043638,Recommended,285050,10251911,"Posted: 27 May, 2014",all,Melrick,"In 2005, developer Lionhead Studios released “The Movies”, a game that enabled you to build a movie studio from scratch and make movies.  It was a great idea, but since then, there’s been precious little that’s attempted to tackle the same subject.“Showtime!” isn’t on the same level of production as “The Movies” but it does take on the same concept.  Where as “The Movies” was all about the pretty graphics, “Showtime!” attempts to do it largely via text.  When you build a sound studio, don’t expect to actually see it; likewise, when you release a movie, you won’t be able to watch your masterpiece.Some people will already be turned off by that, because they think it sounds dull and boring.  And probably for some people it will be.  But if you’re checking out this game then you’re presumably interested in the concept, and considering there’s pretty much nothing else out there like it, I feel it’s at least worth a look just for that.You can start your career from any year, back to 1927.  As the years pass, technology will progress, which means you’ll need to upgrade your equipment, or risk producing poor quality movies.  You have to hire a script writer (or perhaps buy an existing script), hire a director and producer, as well as actors.  There are many factors that go into deciding whether you produce a turkey, or a monster global hit.The game isn’t perfect.  It’s a great concept, but it’s limited in scope, although that’s perfectly understandable considering the tiny independent developer.  There has also been bugs in the game, sometimes big ones.  But the great thing is that the developer is very eager to identify and eliminate the bugs.  For example, I reported a game breaking bug, and within 24 hours a new patch was out that fixed it.  How many developers, big or small, can honestly say something similar?Another problem with the current build is that some technologies aren’t linked to the year of movie development.  For example, you can use CGI in your movies right from 1927.  Likewise, if you wish to purchase an existing script, one category you can chose from – again, right from the start – is video game adaptions.  The developer is aware of these limitations, though, and is apparently keen to try and find ways to address these concerns, once all the bugs have been squashed.I do think it’s worth buying this game, because of the concept and because the developer is very eagerly continuing to work on it.  However, I only recommend it if you understand that the game is essentially text based and that you’re okay with that.  You should be because it's actually rather addictive!UPDATE: Those technologies that were wrongly available right from the start have already been fixed, so now no long will you be able to use CGI nor buy a script based on a video game in the 1920's.  And the bugs are rapidly getting ironed out, and I can't applaud the developer enough for his diligence."

The former WILL garner better results BUT the latter is great fun and, on the easier settings, will still produce some great results.Whilst the game DOES lack a little depth, it does possess a lot of charm and replayability...it has that undescribable, 'just...one...more...turn' that Game Dev Tycoon is probably the best exponent of in this type of game."

Manage something fun and be creative at the same time? Awesome. The reviews, however, were pretty shocking. ""Mixed"" doesn't even cover the polar-opposite reviews. So, I threw the game in my wishlist and waited for a sale. I picked it up for $.59, and to be honest, I would have paid $15-20 for the game had I known how good it is. The dev seems to have put a whole lot of effort into fixing what didn't work and adding features that make the game memorable. Last night, I lost 5 hrs when I sat down to just ""play for a second"". It's that fun! It might be slow in the beginning, when you don't have much money for movies... but within one year, it picks up pace.I highly recommend this game.

If you ever wished you could make a movie, it's your time to shine. This game is highly addictive, once you start you just don't want to stop. I highly recommend to anyone who buys this game to visit the official site, where you even can find mods for Showtime!, in which you can download real life actors, producers, directors for your game, so there are infinite number of projects to try out here, if you are a real fan of films. The game even gives you Editor tool, which is really easy to use, (usually as someone who just likes to play and not get behind how everything work, I can't find a thing in most editors) so even if you can't find your favourite actor, actress (or you wish they would be) you can very easily import them.In short, highly enjoyable and addictive game, it's price truly worth the money and the game devs actually listen to you (that's why I edited my first comment, so you can see it) and updates come out regularly. I can honestly say, this game was the best buy I made on Steam in a long time. Just don't start this game the day before one of your exams :DIt can be quite enjoyable, but after a while it gets very frustrating, mainly becouse of the screenwriting, which is just a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ becouse if you want to have a good one you just have to reselect every single month the ""Script revision"" till you get 5 stars everywhere. Now after I paused the game and went to do something else I just don't want to return to it, for this reason only. Otherwise, the director, actor, producer management is quite good and the poster feature is a nice touch too, so it really has potential and can be enjoyable, but the script writing part is really bad. I get it, why you can do it, but it completely ruins the experience, so while it stays the same I can recommend it only for the most obsessed movie-suckers. If the screenwriting part would be changed, I am sure I would just spend all day playing with this game, becouse every other part of it's just awesome for a person who loves movies as much as I do."

,Recommended,285050,14847843,"Posted: 11 March, 2015",all,Zanriel,"[Edit] The developer responded and there's also a recent update to the game so I'm changing my review while still being as honest as possible.1. No resolution options, it's windowed mode and just takes up a tiny part of a 1920x1080 screen.[edit] There is now a fullscreen option but the game is still locked to 4:3 ratio.2. No matter what time period you choose, it still talks about internet and social media buzz.[edit] Dev response: ""That shouldnt be the case. I've deliberately made most of the news events decade-specific so you dont get those sort of news items. A couple might have been missed so for that I apologise- let me know what they say and I can fix them easily.""3. Not enough feedback to base decisions on. I made a movie with top notch talent, rewrote the script to make sure the story was great, had 100% star quality, but the movie still bombed.[edit] I'm still not sure why the movie bombed, other than the fact that I only had 12mil left for the marketing budget and the recommendation was 22mil, which was double what the movie cost to make.4. When you make a movie, you're locked into your choices and then whatever you have left over you can use for marketing. But marketing is 2x-3x more than the movie cost to make! I don't think that's how it works, but I could be wrong![edit] I still see this as an issue. The game doesn't tell you what goes into the recommended marketing budget, so it's almost impossible to tell how much money you'll need to set aside after production costs.I'm super impressed by the developer taking time to address my points, and also still supporting this game over a year after release. I think this game would be fun for people who enjoy tycoon type games, or who are fascinated by the business side of movie making.Ever play The Sims 2, 3, or 4? You know how on that game you can write a novel or something, pick a genre, give it a name, and then send it off and start receiving royalty payments? Imagine a game based around that idea, except you're making movies instead, and you have a lot more decisions you can make. That's what this game is like.I'm changing my review to a thumbs up because I can tell this game is made with heart by a passionate, responsive developer, and that's too rare these days."

The main problem with this game is what most text based games suffer from is no clear tutorial, while there is one it doesn't teach you all the things you need to know and after it finishes there is still a learning curve.Problems:After I installed the game I had to restart my PC so text will appear this is a common problem for windows 10 with this game but an easy fix.Nevagating the menus at first can feel abit click on this and see what it does, after about an hour you get the gist of it.No clear end goal or milestones to achieve.To many award ceremonies one or two a year would be fine but this game has almost one a month.Lacking depth to make gameplay more engaging.Can get repetative.Good things:Game knows what it is which is a windowed side activity that you play while watching movies or tv shows.Price point even when not on sale worth it.This game provide a great building block if the dev wants to make sequel or similar games.Freedom to make any movie you want and don't hold your hand. (can also be a negitive)Always enjoyed the box office breakdown even when my movie flopped.Conclusion:Good game with some faults but an easy by at $4.99almost feel bad that I bought it while it was on sale.Hope this dev continues making games and if they doI'd be intrested in seeing what else they Produce."

When it went on sale, I really didn't think I could go wrong with buying it.  I was right.  It's a fun management sim, but it isn't flashy.  After awhile, you're making money so fast that there really isn't a challenge to the game anymore.It seems to me that the awards logic is completely random and not based on anything.  At one point in the game, I had the 5 highest grossing, critically-acclaimed films of the year, yet I did not receive a single award at any of the ceremonies.  A little hokey, I think.If you can score this title on sale, like I did, I thing you'll get a good 10 -12 hours out of it.  Not sure I'd spend the money for a full price download though."

With virtually no dynamic aspects to the game, a $5 million basic sound set costs the same regardless of whether it's 1927 or 2020, staff do not age (just random retirements and a few new ones at the start of each year) and movie income will be the same regardless of the era.The process of creating a movie is as basic as it gets. Buy or write a script, throw a director, producer and some actors into the mix, set the budget and wait a few months for it to complete. After this, you spend a bit on marketing then release the movie. The month of the release you get 3 screens. One tells you how much money was made, the next gives a percentage out of 100 for your film score and the final one shows the ratings of the staff.Want to know why an actor, producer or director got a bad rating in your movie? Want to know if they were mismatched to the genre, are totally useless or just had a bad filming experience? TOUGH! There is absolutely no feedback regarding their performance so good luck figuring out why they bombed.That pretty much sums up the entire gameplay. Just keep churning out movie after movie with the only apparent way to get a better movie score is by just throwing more money at it. That's if you can be bothered to keep playing through the boredom and CONSTANT runtime errors that will result in CTDs.A tedious snore fest that requires no skill or strategy and has as much depth as a dry puddle."

Eventually, your studio will ascend to the point of relevance, and gradually become the top dog in Tinseltown ( if you're any good, that is).You're not on our own. Other studios will try to bring you and your upstart studio down. The rival studios release films too, and more often than not will take home the awards at the formal ceremoies in place of your films.The managing aspect of Showtime is quite in-depth , but not in an overwelming manner by any means. There is a wide array of buildings that will enhance yor studio's turnout, for a hefty sum, in most cases, and you really do feel like you own an actual stuio.The game is rife with parodies of modern award ceremonies and studios ( Metro Silver Slayer, anyone?) and the writing is generally to a high standard.The film making itself won't be everyone's cup of tea, unfortuantely. You hire actors, writers, directors, producers etc. to appear in your film, and this is quite in depth in itself. You create posters for the film and allocate a budget. However, you don't really have a hand in your film from there. You leave the guys to it, and they will be finished in a couple of months. Simple as that. You then wait for the money to roll in, and voila! On you go to your next film.  There is more to the system, but you get the idea. Although I don't find fault in it, I presume others might.Finally, the dev ( yes, just one) is extremely active in the community, and makes a genuine effort to listen to player's feedback. The game was released quite a while ago, yet only yesterday was another update released for the game. He really is interested in making the game the best it can be, which is more than can be said for an awful lot of other devs. He is also working on a sequel to the game, and is committed to implementing much-desired features.To summarise, the game is quite enjoyable and very resonably priced, and although your mileage may vary, this is definately worth a purchase - if you're into this kind of thing, of course! :)Verdict: 8.3/10"

In addition, the developer of this game has released frequent updates over the course of the last year, improving the base game in multiple ways.

,Recommended,285050,10258312,"Posted: 27 May, 2014",all,craigbic,"I came into Showtime! very skeptical after reading many of the reviews but was very pleasantly surprised to find an approachable and fun game with simple yet addictive mechanics. If you're an old movie buff or were a big fan of the Lionhead Studios game The Movies, than I think you will find a lot to like here.In the game, you are the head of your own movie studio. You can pick a starting date from 1927 up to 2013. As time passes bigger and better film and sound technology will become available to you but not always when you would expect it to (more about that later). You may choose the huge expense of upgrading to get the best possible quality for your movies or hang on to that outdated equipment to save a buck. You have a choice of buying existing scripts or hiring writers of various quality (indicated by star ranks and letter grades) to write original first drafts. Once written, scripts are rated for various categories such as pace, story arc, and characterization among others. The quality and experience of the writers in general as well as their ratings in these specific categories effects the quality of the script overall and for those categories. If you don't like the quality ratings of the script within a category or categoriesthen you can hire another writer to (preferably with better ratings than the one you hired before - at least for the problem categories) do a revision, a partial rewrite, or a total rewrite. Keep in mind, all of these take additional time. Once a script is ready, hire directors, actors (leading and supporting), and producers as needed. You may negotiate their contracts to help save money by tweaking the amount of up-front cash they receive and whether they get any percentage points of the gross film take. Actors can be assigned to direct or produce, directors to produce, and producers to direct all for the same salary to save additional cash at the expense, potentially, film quality. Once everyone is assigned their roles, you assign the production budget, special FX budget, CGI budget, hire stunt men and start filming. Random events can happen at anytime during the process such as writers needing additional time, actors dying by accident, tantrums, sickness, etc.. which is a nice touch and all of them  effect your production schedule. Once filming completes, you then set your films marketing and release budget and select whether to launch globally or to a limited market. Next you pick a release date and can even give your movie a custom movie poster from image files on your computer - which is a nice touch for those of us who like to REALLY get into a game and do a little RPG'ing. There is also a 7% revenue increase for movies with custom posters to act as an incentive to actually put one together, although I suppose you COULD use any old crummy image from your desktop instead of going through the bother of putting together mock movie posters(which is what I've been doing). After you launch, you either start raking in the dough or you start packing up for skid row. I'm glossing over the details for the sake of this review but there are a lot of variables that can effect the quality of your movie and the reception to it by the viewers.Where Lionhead's The Movies was very graphics oriented, Showtime! is very text driven. There are very few visuals and only a few basic sounds - not even background music as of now but what is there is enough to make the game compelling and addictive. There is more depth in the movie production process with Showtime! over Lionhead's The Movies which was much more about putting together actual 3D movies. The developer for Showtime! has gone the extra distance to put in some nice features such as the ability to pick custom movie posters for each of your movies, the ability to create movie sequels and start a film series complete with devoted fans - you can even sell the rights to a movie series if your studio is short of cash, long-term contract deals with talent, a movie hall of fame, and internal game achievements (although why this hasn't been worked into Steam achievements is beyond me - maybe down the road?).There are bugs and some odd time-period/linearity problems such as CGI being available in 1927 but the developer is very active with his community and seems to be right on top of getting our feedback and working it into regular updates along with all of the bug fixing.I do highly recommend this game if you're a fan of quirky mostly text-based games or old movies! It's very much worth the price and the developer is definitely continuing to work on improving it."

Generating a 5* script and tossing a big budget at a movie are both simple to do, and my experience, always lead to a profit. Game is as simple as clicking the button to re-write a script until it hits 5* (takes a few re-writes, but this is absolutely not something that is difficult to accomplish) and then tossing a giant budget at it. It's a simple as that.There are also tons of bugs. Save often. My best advice is save often and toss big numbers at your movies."

Thus far the developer has been good as far as support goes and has been active on the Steam forums (a plus).Basically you run a movie studio, develop a movie, assign folks to it and release it.

EDIT - there have been updates and it seems more stable...The gameplay is fairly repetitive and some things - like how many roles there are in a series - don't carry over from one iteration to another in a franchise.  So every movie has to be adjusted or you will release endless rated G pictures with one actor.  A randomize button, followed by customization, would have been nice.  Or default recommendations.  Some screens have incomplete information to help you make choices (like, what movie was I working on again?).I have had fun in my first two hours, I went back and took it slower next time, and it crashed again.  I'm back again for a third time and having more luck.  Save often, or you'll need to reboot every franchise you make, but there aren't many games I've gone back to this many times.

Luckily, after some time, I hit the steam Icon by accident, so Steam got started. This game, however, does not scale at all. There's a Window in the middle of my screen, considerably smaller than a CD Jewel case, which might or might not contain the game - I couldn't tell. And I thought scaling a window was something that pretty much every programmer in the world solved around the late 90's.Folks, if you want to write a game, and sell it, like 'professionals', use a professional framework that takes care of it or at least! seperate the rendering logic and make a quick call to determine dpi scaling support. Scaling can than be achieved via SetProcessDPIAware (from Winuser.h) or in Java by using JavaFX. If you don't know what that means, you're not ready to sell your game. If your framework does not support that, you'll need to change your framework (seriously). If that sounds like too much work, you're not ready to sell your game. Really? Really. Sorry.So, what's the final verdict? I have a severe head ache now, and my eyes hurt. After trying to plax the game for 4 minutes. Last game that did that was the unfathomably bad X Rebirth (for different reasons, though. And to be fair, this game was € 61 cheaper).However, I still look forward to trying this game if it ever gets a working screen renderer.PS: So I had to start it again, since appearently you cannot write a review if you've used a game for less than 5 minutes (dumbest rule ever?

As long as you're conservative advertising your first three or four movies, and don't build much in the way of facilities until you have spare cash, you're golden.  Rewrite till the script is perfect, cast decent actors, watch money roll in.  (Also helps to use your own plots, rather than buying adaptations.)   Starting in 1950 with $25 million, at the hardest setting, I maxed out every film studio aspect possible and amassed over $2 billion in less than five years game time, with 10 films in various degrees of completion.It wasn't even necessary to pay attention to what kind of movie I made or what time of year I released it.  I made over $270 million on two documentaries, for God's sake.  Sequels are seemingly impossible to lose money on.  (I assume you have to cast at least one of the original stars; I never tried recasting everyone.)  I changed genres in sequels without alienating the audience.  My LEAST successful film--my first--still made $17.5 million.  Of course, it may be that I was born to run a film studio, but I have my doubts.Also, a design bug:  If you put people under contract, you only have to pay them once for up to 8 movies, and then they do all the movies for free.  That doesn't SEEM likely.  And it is hardly necessary to make money in the game.I like this sort of game, and the designer is still working to improve it, so I will give it the most grudging of thumb's up."

In short, I can describe the game in three vital areas:- Building, maintenance, and development of a studio and facilities that contribute to your publicity and production- Very detailed 6-phase production of a movie (can work on 6 movies at a time, though it is very difficult to do so if you're trying to make 6 star quality screenplay) Script-writing phase, casting (Even the Producers and Directors you choose matter) , production, marketing, and release.- After all of your production work, then it comes to release. How did the audience like it, critics, did it make or lose money, where did you open it, what was the appeal? Then there is several award ceremonies that occur over the course of the year (this game is turn-based on a monthly scale) and your movie winning an award can increase home release sales if you choose to market it - adds prestige to your studio - and you can create a filmseries that makes even more money as you attract a fanbase to that series.

We all make purchase mistakes and this is mine.** Edit **My apologies for the comparison to The Movies game. This was obviously not going to be a AAA big budget contender to that, however from the description and the curators comments I was expecting more involvement in a variety of aspects in the industry too rather than, as others have said, getting the best actors/scriptwriters/directors and chucking a load of money at it then simply one clicking to upgrade the set or FX when you have enough cash. As the dev kindly pointed out it does not claim to be anything like the movies but I would have liked to have seen more involvement with studio aspects:*Researching & development*Innovating new tech in lighting/sound/sets/fx etcexpanding your studio to make bigger/epics etc*Actor/Producer/Director relationships*Set design/upgrades or hiring designers and setting out a brief on the films aspects that require focus for example if the film is a horror you could advise the designers to add cetain effects (fog,lightning etc) or cetain sounds or even soundtrack - modern or classical.*More interaction with crew - If only a text based game you could have conversations with scenarios that could lead to actors not wanting to work for your studio again or building a long standing freindship with directors/scrpitwriters a la Lucas/Speilberg.The concept had/has promise but is,overall, not engaging enough (for me , personally) to hold my interest for long playthroughs.I am more than happy to give it chance with the updates since last played and will add to review given time"

It's simplicity allows a lot replayability.  And you get your money's worth.  There are better games out there, THE MOVIES, but that is nearly 10 years old, and has lacked support.  It also bogs down as it tries to do too many things.  SHOWTIME on the other hand let's you run a studio and make films using siple controls.  The decisions seem to make some effect on the game, yet I was surprised that one of my sequels made a gazzilion dollars.I would like to see the following features:  Being able to start in 1920 with silent pictures and a smaller studio system, having verticle integration (i.e., buying, running and owning distribution channels AND theater chains), and being able to choose a HOME city and territory.Some things though seem to make little difference.  The city chose to make a film or some of the film or sound quality do not make much difference.  It would be great to automatically retain case and director on a re-make/sequel. Also would be great to see how many films a particular actor has been in (one actor I used was a low level actor, after the first film he jumped to A-List status demanding 30+ million dollars, so I assume he also made other films, since mine was a mediocre success).Other than that I think overall the game is worth it.  You will probably burn out after 2-3 hours.  But it's a game you can come back to later.  Because of this it is within what I would classify a THUMBS UP game."

I had started the company with a hundred million dollars and turned it into a multi-billion dollar company. I sat there smiling to myself. I was cocky, arrogant, but also humble as my many pictures of myself hung on my walls proved. I started looking over some ideas for future movies; perhaps more sequels were in order since the previous sequels of my several series had all done well. Just as I was thinking about it, my main writer burst into my office. Her name was Francis…something-or-other. I’m a busy man, I can’t be bothered to learn names.She looked me dead in the eyes and said, “Sir, I have a slight complaint, if you would be so kind as to indulge me.”I nodded and motioned for her to sit down in the chair in front of my desk and she obliged.I smiled at her and said very sweetly, “What seems to be the problem?”“It’s your movie summaries, sir, or should I say lack thereof?”“I don’t understand.”“Your movie summaries don’t make any sense. Take for example this one script you gave to me not too long ago. You titled it ‘Little Doggy Choo-Choo’ and your movie summary was simply, ‘Da fuq?'”I chuckled to myself, “Yeah, that’s because I had no idea where that title came from.”“Right,” she said, still perplexed. “But how am I supposed to write a screenplay when you haven’t given me anything? Is the dog’s name Choo-Choo? How little is he? What does he do? ‘Da fuq?’ is not very helpful.”“You’re the screenwriter, you make it up.”“Okay, but how about this one? The third movie in the ‘Deception’ series has the plot summary: ‘No one asked for it…so here you go.’ Do you actually want me to write something here?”“Of course. I gave you a title, didn’t I?”“Yeah, a pretty bad title. ‘Deception 3: Deceptiest’? There’s no such word as deceptiest.”“There is now!” I said, smiling.“I have another complaint,” she sighed.“Oh?” I asked, sitting up straight.“Yes,” she said, “Whenever I give you a script, you always give it to someone else to do slight revisions. Now I don’t necessarily have a problem with that, but, for some reason the entire script winds up being credited to this other guy even though he just did slight touch-ups and I still did basically the entire script.”“You still get paid, don’t you?”“I guess.”“Then why do you need the credit? Who cares if it’s credited to you or this other guy? Do you think people actually pay attention to who the screenwriter is?”“It would be nice to win the award for best screenplay for once, that’s all. When I see that my movie won for best screenplay, and this other guy who did barely any work on it at all is accepting the trophy, it kind of angers me a little.”“He doesn’t get paid nearly as much as you do, let him have the trophy.”She sighed and I thought I was done, but just then another screenwriter burst through my door.For the full review and the rest of the story, please visit:http://beingstephenkaplan.com/2015/01/15/its-showtime-a-video-game-review-and-a-short-story/"

There was nothing left to aim for except maybe if I'd wanted to chase every possible award show nomination (that don't seem to have any real effect on the game), which would've required me to do even more of this repetetive process.The idea of the game itself is pretty good, but it needs something more to have appeal that lasts longer than a few hours."

I really like these games like Game Dev Tycoon, where you not only build your own empire, but you can name and personalize things. This game was less than a buck, so I said, ok. Boot it up, NO TEXT WAS VISIBLE. The news for the game told me about the fix, which is restarting. Ok, so I did it. Still no visible text. I click on the Read More link for the fix article, and it turns out, the article isn't even there. The most recent one is about Steam Trading Cards. I'm very disappointed, just on principle. I hate having games I can't play because the devs can't be bothered to patch them. Don't buy games from these developers. And...got my five minutes of playtime, so I can post this review."

I was quite wrong.I know it's a cheap little indie game, but I found it boring. When you create a save, you are immediately put to work, coming up with a movie. You hire actors and actresses, directors and staff. Then you wait for something because you can't continue until something happens? I don't get what I'm waiting for because the game makes it confusing. At this point I decide that I'm bored, I've just wasted 10 minutes of my time and I want a refund.So I got that refund and now I'm leaving a review on this game to tell you why I wouldn't recommend it, but honestly, it's up to you what you want to do with your money. If you want to spend it on this game then I can't stop you."

Basic idea was you created a film studio from the ground up, and ran every aspect about it from the screenwriting, acting, and release.  It was pretty much a god game only instead of workign with people, you work with movies.  This game tries to do the same thing, with mixed results.  On one hand, having everything mainly be text based, makes it easy (for the most part) on your machine, but leaves what models there are, less appealing.  However, there is a big issue with this game, which is why I do not recommend it.  Around the time of this game's release I was rather harsh.I still stand by the notion that, at release, the game was broken, and barely working.  However, credit does go out to the developer, for working with the community to help resolve the bigger issues in a timely manner, and now a days the game works pretty well.  Granted, we then get into that grey area of a broken game getting released and fixed later.  However, once again, with those issues resolved we can get into the meat of the game itself.Being mostly text based, the game looks alright, with really the big issue being the placeholder models used for actors, producers, and directors.  It might be more of a personal taste, but I would have perferred no models than what is used.Even though the game becomes rather tedious after a while, that does give the player a bigger freedom to try and experiment, but with limited results.  Either dump all your money into a project, and because one thing was right it'll make every dime back, or fail miserably still makes the game difficult to fully recommend.  Yet, at the end of the day, it's a cheap simulator game, for a subject area not many games do, and isn't trying to boost its bugs as part of the game, so...plus there.  There is content in this game, and for a film buff, it's hard to not try and enjoy at least.It's more of a quick burst kind of game.  Not to expense, you load it up--which being mostly text based does make the game load and run smoothly when it works--and play for about an hour."
