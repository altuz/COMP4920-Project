If you like games like Life Is Strange or Oxenfree, you would probably like this one too. I need to mention that this game has a message, not every gamer would like.Great, short game that leave marks."

I know this is early access so I might change my recommendation to Yes after a while. The price is way too much at the moment for what I experienced and would encourage people to either be fully aware that the game needs a lot of work before buying. I left the game after almost 1 hour because of too many bugs and I couldn't even do anything at the end.Please try and make the combat and movement more fluid/responsive and get rid of the bugs.I created a gameplay video where you can see most of the bugs towards the end of it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGhlzf5qe34"
76561198046881436,Not Recommended,285070,29579953,Posted: 29 January,all,Garthorium,"Between Me and the Night originally drew me in based purely not only its presentation, but the general consensus of the games rating.Things this game has going for it:- Atmosphere; whether you're tiptoeing through the brooding halls of the school, moping from a bad set of luck in the apartment, or curiously exploring your childhood home, this game at least gets its atmospheres done well with good sound design and art style.- Art Style; nice clear cut lines with waves and strokes overall forming a nice image. A nice colour palette compliments the games implied points.- Soundtrack; whilst very limited, the soundtrack plays where it matters most, and is generally welcomed during the seldom times it does play, be it the chilling pieces during encounters, or even the sombre main menu.Things the game doesn't have going for it:- Gameplay; heavily leaning on point and click adventure with some puzzle elements, there were multiple occasions where I became frustrated with the overwhelming array of useable items, most it seems which have no value or use at all other than to persuade the player to experiment. The school section is the largest offender by far here. Some of the puzzles are logical, whilst at other times I disappointedly had to refer to a guide. There are times too when you must avoid particular 'enemies', which soon become more of a hassle then a genuine threat. The forced combat levels are a chore; combat is seriously lacking, and there's almost no actual need to block any incoming strikes (I took about 10 direct hits and my character didn't die, and in the nature of this game, I'd say that's enough to kill the character.). They are completely straightforward and seem to only serve as symbolism as maybe personal growth.- Game length; Following everything to the letter, you can have this game done in an hour, maybe a bit more. $15 is a steep asking price for something with not a whole lot of content to offer. Especially when most of your play time comes from trying to find a use for every single item you are capable of picking up.- Plot; I'll be straightforward here, the plot is nothing short of vague and perhaps pretentious. From my understanding this is supposed to represent the developers personal experiences, hinted at by means I won't discuss. Without knowing this however, the game tries to communicate to you a greater sense of value, and I think it fails in a sense because of the very nature of its gameplay. One goes looking for significance in places it does not exist.Overall Verdict:I can only honestly recommend this game at a heavy discount. Whilst I can appreciate the effort and intentions behind this game, I unfortunately cannot recommend playing it. Between the mix of frustrating gameplay elements, confusing, almost non-existant plot, and very inflated sense of self impression, I can only say this game is a rather bold attempt to make a game with required deeper sense of understanding, but it falls short with frustrating gameplay, short game length, and when considering everything... a very demanding price."

The ""puzzles"" are basically a loot for certain objects, and unfortunately the house is literally filled with any kind of things you can pick (and drop anywhere). Lack of voiced dialogues also doesnt make it as immersive as it could be. The puzzles themself at times are quite odd, which might be fine but also make for some frustration."
,Recommended,285070,17966449,"Posted: 10 September, 2015",all,Lowrater,"Between Me and The Night, is a unique and incredible adventure game, that pulls you deep into a boys hearth to feel his thin paths of sanity and calm.The first thing we see is some torturial part how the mechanics works, after that we wake up from his insane dreams and feel his madness within loneliness. It's a quite interesting game and art design. It has a unique flow of a story as the kid dreams his insane worlds and create things with his mind. Yet that the kid love video games as much as his parents, the house and world will take shape of any unrealistic and childish mind of a young boy.Besides the good art design, the game pulls you deep into the story for exploring since you have options to intereact objects and many other interesting things to either save in his pocket or ""quest"" objects. The objects can be anything that might lead on with the story, which you can either do with controller or keyboard. Any object that is interactable has a description, which lead us to the point where the developers are adding more intel to the game, which makes the game more alive.Yet the price point is high for 30-1 hour gameplay in it's current state, then we are looking at something quite unique and we have much to see forward too. So, if you want to see some fantastic art design and follow a young boy while looking through his eyes to either describe his loneliness or what makes him complete, then this game is for you.Here is the current available content:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXSQvw_8wP0"

I did end up spending 6 hours on it, but mainly because I spent a solid two hours trying to solve one puzzle.There are still some glitches in the game. Sometimes animations or pictures would screw up (eg NPCs disappearing, animations being triggered inconsistently, my sprite disappearing when attacked at an unusal time, an inventory item containing the wrong image for the object). Sometimes I would have difficulty walking up or down stairs in the knight's world. They updated the game since I first started playing so some of these may be fixed already.I WISH there was a way to save the damn game between chapters. It autosaves when you progress but if you're stuck on a puzzle (like I was) you have to re-do all previous progress the next time you load the game (though to be fair, once you know them you can redo it pretty quickly...)"

I found myself trying them again and again since they brought along the good old memories from the 80s 8-bit platforms (ZX Spectrum anyone?)"

Or I didn't?Nitty GrittyI really wanted to like this game, I really did.  After the tutorial, you have to build a game system.  The controls are really unresponsive and it makes doing anything a chore.  Next, you have to go get breakfast, but your family are ghosts?  Then do two random things.  Wonder around the house getting eaten by some monster thing until I finally find two things that go together.  Repeat the last sentence or just read a walkthrough -- though at that point, just save $10 and watch a playthrough.  4/10"
