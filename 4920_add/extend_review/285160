Suprising enough I look forward to it as much as he does.  The simplicity of playing a game like this is really enjoyable.  The voice acting is excellent (it should be since it is taken right from the films).    If you're a parent looking for a safe game to enjoy with your kid(s); this is it.

For Warner Bros. to announce that they will not expand the game to include BOTFA, is just ridiculous.Only buy this game if you like leaving the cinema half an hour before a film ends or quitting a book just before the action starts.

THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE, AND SHOULD BE ADVERTISED AS UNFINISHED.This isn't an ""epic adventure across Middle Earth to recapture the Lonely Mountain."" Lies, precious! No Mountains were captured in the making (or playing) of this game.LEGOs n' Tolkien? This is biblical status nerdism! By far one of the most progressive LEGO games to date, LEGO Hobbit is super pretty and cleverly put together. Even with the chaos of dozens of characters, the game is patient & advises you gently, like a priest might. Unfortunately, this LEGO game is like one of those priests I warn parents about because he turns out to be untrustworthy and may make your children cry.Shameful part is, I was happily playing when it ended suddenly. No matter how good your game is, and this WAS A GOOD GAME, you're a buncha dirty cheats if you are using it to distract me so you can jot down my credit card information for later. I'm a diehard Tolkien fan from the time my Dad read me the Hobbit & LOTR as a beautiful series of bedtime stories. Those are some of my fondest childhood memories aside from the beatings, and it's a shame that I can't honestly recommend this lovely game interpretion as it is missing a huge part: the end.Pros:* Invisible walls seem to be popping up way less, they must've cut the guy whose job that was. Good thing he got that job working on Shadows of Mordor.* Purdy scenery & funny NPC dialogue, voice actors & game designers were obviously having fun.* New minigames that are forgiving and interesting to watch. I thought the building quests were a great idea.* LEGO LOTR never saved a single checkpoint for me, this game worked perfectly in that regard. Thank you, from the people who are overachievers and gotta catch 'em all.* Helpful gameplay, lots of advice that you can choose to read or ignore.* Improved camera, which still isn't saying much. Better than a sharp stick in the eye?* IT IS TOLKIEN Y'ALLCons:* No sheep racing. Baaaaaaaaaa-d.* Until you beat the whole game, you can't have freeplay in the main world. No changing characters or roaming free for a minute, LEGO Hobbit is here to make you eat your meat before you get to enjoy your pudding.* Repetitive gameplay, but to be fair that is what you're signing up for.* No cheat codes except for characters. Sad for kids who keep falling or find parts of it too hard. I don't have kids but I can imagine their teary little faces. Heh heh. I mean. Aw.* Silence from TT about DLC and updates.* May seem picky, but not being able to zoom in and out of the unlabeled map was very frustrating. There are a few parts in the game where they make it impossible for you to go back the way you came, which is a tried & true idea but if you're going for that your map had better be easy to navigate and specific. This was neither. It kind of ruins the epic feel when you can't see a clear image of the entire world."

,Not Recommended,285160,24440004,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,Porkbean,"This is a pretty standard LEGO game, and if you've played one, you've pretty much played them all.  I find them to be good stress-relievers, generally; the combat is mindless and what puzzles there are are very simple, but they tend to go on sale for pretty cheap and offer dozens of hours of relaxing play if you go for full completion and all the achievements.  They're even better if you're a fan of the franchises, like Lord of the Rings / The Hobbit in this case.That all said, there are three big reasons I wouldn't recommend this game.First, it's incredibly buggy.  I've had the game crash completely on me three times now, losing a levels-worth of progress each time, and I've encountered bugs that required restarting the game to fix at least a dozen times.  These bugs mainly consist of scripted QTEs not popping up when they're supposed to; the blacksmithing mini-game and the Goblin King boss were the worst offenders here, but I've also gotten stuck while fast-traveling or even going outside from an indoor area.Second, a lot of the dialogue and side quests are incredibly tedious and unskippable if you're going for full completion.  Most of the side quests are fine, but the escort missions, obstacle courses or the occasional ""find 500 of a particular loot"" ones were largely buggy or tedious.  On top of this, you can't skip the NPC dialogue when starting a side-quest for the first time.  The dialogue is generally at least okay, but after the 60th time or so it starts to wear pretty thin.Finally, and most glaringly, it's unfinished.  The missions stop at the end of the second movie's plot, and apparently the developer has canceled plans to finish the game.  This means the plot is left unresolved and large areas that were built around this future content are left conspicuously empty (primarily the areas in and around Erebor and Dale).  The final bonus stage is also really lackluster compared to the ones in previous games.Unless you're willing to overlook these fairly large issues or the game is on a really good sale (or you're a really huge fan of the first two Hobbit movies), I'd recommend passing on this one.  Pick up LEGO Lord of the Rings, Marvel Super Heroes or Batman 2 or 3 instead, as they're much more worthy of your time."

They added an attempt at a crafting system (extremely rudementary and not very well executed), and they finally allowed us to see what the characters can do as we select them from the big list.  But that's mostly because a majority of the characters are virtually the same.  Which is more the problem with the story than the game.  It has the same type of overworld as Lego LOTR, with questing and such.  Elements of the overworld unlock as you play through the story.All in all, on a technical level, the game's a fairly fun Lego game.But the failures come in the adaptation.  First off, they chose to model the game after the movies.  Because of course they did, if they followed the book instead people would be confused and scared and not want to give them money again.  So we have crap like the stupid barrel scene, and the really, REALLY badly done Lake-Town bit (and a level in this game that just never seems to end - much like the movie).  And if they had based it on the book, they could have actually FINISHED THE BLOODY STORY!No, instead, we get 2/3 of the game.  And that's all there will ever be.  There is no DLC for the third movie (which would be a terrible precedent anyway).  There is no second game (which would be about as sorry as Lego Indiana Jones 2).  What we are left with is an eternally incomplete product because they felt the need to rush this game out the door.Do not buy it.  There are plenty of other Lego games to play instead.  And if you have already played all of those, there are plenty of other video games period that are far more worth your time than this incomplete mess."

The game is pretty fun, but ultimately unsatisfying. If you don't mind never completing a game or just want to play it, go for it. But I am pretty upset I bought it because I'll never be able to finish it. Like I said, fun up until the end, but I wish I hadn't bought it in the first place. Just play Lego: LOTR instead, it's more fun to play and also it's not a compressed screen, not like Lego: The Hobbit. It's incredibly disappointing that there won't be a conclusion, it's unfair of WB to do to their buyers. What it's done to me is left me disappointed with a throbbing headache, I can't stand it when I can't complete things, as I'm sure most of you can relate to. If you want to avoid disappointment, anger, frustration, and headaches...I'd say skip out on this game. You never get to speak with Thranduil again (which I admit I was so looking forward to! He's one of my favorites! He's such a lovable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), you never get to see Thorin becoming sick like his father (also something that would have been great), witness that touching, beautiful scene where Bilbo gives Thorin the acorn (very important...espcially to me and my best friend as we have that exact acorn tattooed behind our left ears!!), defeat Smaug for real, OR, and most importantly OR, you NEVER EVER get to see the emotional ending of The Hobbit. Another thing that was disappointing, I'm sure most of us fans loved it when the Dwarves broke out into song at Bilbo's table. I was really hoping that would be added, but my hopes were crushed. It would have been a great thing to see. But I digress, the quality is much more clear in Lego: LOTR as well, this game is blurry and was a bit painful to focus on, just play that instead, that game is worth it. I wish I could give this game a recommendation, I really do. Up to the last 1/3 of the game, it was incredibly fun, it was fantastic even...very different from the other LEGO games I've played and I really liked that about it. If you like incomplete games, go ahead! If you don't and can't stand the endless frustration of never finishing a game, just...don't. Save yourself from this tom foolery and just watch the movies, read the books, play LEGO: LOTR...because there is a void you will never fill because it doesn't end.

It's pretty much easy entertainment with a few challenges, but nothing you'd really get stuck on.I'm not sure if I would enjoy this game all that much just playing it by myself, but it works excellent as a local co-op game and me and my girlfriend had a lot of fun fighting our way through hordes of orcs and other evil doers.The fact that the content of the third movie apparently won't even be released as a DLC really really sucks, but I will still give the game a thumbs up, because the game in itself was a lot of fun."

,Not Recommended,285160,30103327,Posted: 22 February,all,Soul Reaver,"Good and bad game at the same time. The reason for thumb down is quite simple - there are other LEGO games out there.Let's start with PROS:- it is a LEGO game. really, LEGO by Traveller's Tales is a thumbs up by a rule of ... thumb ;) those games are funny, based on our favourite stories (movies, books, comics), what not to love here ... well, you will know a bit later- not a buggy LEGO game. I loved LEGO LotR until it occurred to me that I won't be able to complete the game because items, I have already collected, are missing in my ""inventory"". I played that one 3 times, but similar bugs happened during playthrough and had to stop. In The Hobbit nothing like that happened to me, only a few crashes ... but if I do alt-tabs or hard stop game by closing my laptop while in game ... everything can happen then, so I can tell that game is very stable.- last positive - The Hobbit. I really like Tolkien's stories. Hobbit is really nice book ... for kids :) I don't know how it was possible to create 3 movies out of this quite short book. LotR movies should be about 3 times longer than they were. And here, you have it ... wanted to write ALL, but it's not the right word here and that takes us to ...CONS:- first - it's not a full The Hobbit story. The game is based on first two Hobbit movies. There was a rumour about a DLC with the story based on the last movie, but there won't be one and it's quite understandable if you know the book/movies and have played earlier games. On the Middle-Earth map you will have many missions placed next to each other, because nearly whole third movie takes place in a single area - around Erebor and ""Lake-town"". It's totally different from LotR, where you always moved forward on the map. Anyway, the game is missing some content and you know that.- second - too many, boring side quests. Those are there only to give you more playtime if you want 100% completion.- maybe not a big problem and really forced on the devs by the story, but main characters are all similarly looking (well ... those are the dwarves), yet they have very different abilities. It is a bit hard to distinguish between them at start.- ""female"" voices, really, those do not sound female at all.- DLC ... really, those should be a part of the game as those add nothing to the game. Just some items and characters to the free play mode. Ofc, those can help you a bit with fast start of the game, because e.g. you get Shadow Sword from DLC and you don't need a mithril one or the Sauron to break Morgul statues, but this is not a big help, really. Just get multipliers fast and you will get 10.000.000.000 studs achievement long before any 100% items/quests/bricks/characters one (strange, but achievement stats show something else ... ) and you can buy literally everything you will be offered by the game easily after getting 3 multipliers.TL;DRAgain it IS a good game. Not a bad LEGO game. The missing content (1/3 of the story) and all those boring side quests I had to complete to get 100% completion made me give this negative note. Really there are other LEGO games, that gave me way more fun. Even the buggy and impossible (for me) to complete LotR."

You can breeze through the story mode which is the usual run of mill lego game story, entertaining enough. The free play and open world quests become avaliable after that. All in all, I would say that some of the quests are a bit tedious but what can you expect from fetch quests, the humour is quite funny most of time, there was some bugs along the way but nothing major.

Nothing to rage-inducing.  It is a LEGO Game, plain and simple.  You play levels, you collect stuff, find hidden stuff, break stuff, make stuff, make MORE stuff, and then break it again.  You talk to newly-voiced NPC's and complete quests, forge items, and have a new collection system beyond just the studs you use to buy characters.The added bonus of having Christopher Lee voicing in-between cut-scenes as well is a lovely addition, as well as him voicing something known as the Yodeling Sheild...A good fun game."

The animation is the same, aswell as graphics!Story is pretty interesting, the game can be really hard to understand if you're playing LEGO games for first time, I better recommend ""LEGO Marvel Superheroes"". Of course this game even has freeplay after you do the starting missions. It even has mini quests and the map believe me or not is pretty big. You even can go out of ""The Hobbit"" town to the wildernes. I enjoy playing this game with friends because you can do CO-OP. Sadly theres no multiplayer for LEGO games, and that annoys me. Still haven't figured out how to switch charatchers in freeplay mode. Btw Im playing with a controller. What I love about this, that its actualy pretty real to ""The Hobbit Movie"" and it kind of matches.  They even have the ""cutscenes"" or ""movie clips"" where they show a small clip.And I really like that they have added something cool - Minigames.

By all means if you a fan of The Hobbit and Lego games in general pick it up. If you have played LotR then a lot of the function and design will be very familiar although sadly with the inclusion of a few more annoying elements.I think part of the problem stems from the film. Lego LotR had three films and an epic world to pull information from, and therefore felt rich and entertaining. But The Hobbit feels limited due to the film stretching the source material out too far, the journey from Hobbiton to Erebor doesn't feel half as epic as the one to Mount Doom. You just don't want to explore the world. As sandbox games go this is a limiting factor.The main annoying trait is the ""crafting"" system. Which now requires you to have to correct elements of lego pieces collected throughout the levels to unlock various upgrades needed to gain other perks. Sadly I found this very tedious and added another layer of banality around it.What the Lego Hobbit should have been was a single DLC expansion to the Lego LotR and contained within the same world. Sadly we got a large dull world, a dull cast and a thin, stretched out world. Even Lego Marvel which I loved, has a boring open world, but at least has interesting characters that you ""want"" to unlock.

,Recommended,285160,12955240,"Posted: 15 November, 2014",all,Locke,"LEGO The Hobbit is, first and foremost, a LEGO game. There isn't a great deal different from other LEGO titles, in both bad and good ways. If you've tried LEGO games before and found them dull, I don't think this one will change your mind, but if you have an obsession for collection, this game will probably serve you well.First of all, some gripes. I really don't like how the gameforcesyou to come back later and re-do things when you already have the means to complete them at your disposal, simply locked away. It takes advantage of a child's endless appetite for repetition (Pokemon, anyone?), but as an adult it gets frustrating at times. And speaking of frustrating, the game has some bugs too. I've had characters get stuck, once even in a game-breaking way in the middle of a story mission that locked out all buttons but Start and forced me to quit. The physics on hills and edges get weird sometimes and prevent you from jumping, which can sometimes lead to the stuck thing or lead to death in the middle of a jumping puzzle. I would also get random crashes for a while, which was fixed by turning off Raptr's integration completely, even the Track Gameplay part (the only part I actually use). And the end of the game cuts off at a really bad time, though that's not entirely their fault, since from what I understand the movie does too. Perhaps they should have waited for the third movie to come out to release this. Hopefully they put out some DLC to add in the final climax. It's literally only missing the last chapter or two from the book.Now that I've gotten that out of the way, the game is still fun. It's still cathartic to beat up LEGO objects and watch them explode into fountains of loot and studs. The gradual ramp of power and wealth starts to get quite high near the end, and I feel a bit Smaug looking over my vast collection of items and riches. Okay, I admit that pun was terrible. Moving on. None of the missions, quests, or puzzles are particularly difficult or complex, but are still fun nonetheless. Suitably accessible for a child but still enjoyable for an adult, a good balance. I'm about 28 hours in and I still haven't gotten tired of it. The bits of humor injected into the game here and there are a nice touch as well. My favorite gag is Azog's missing hand actually following him around and constantly taunting him. Great way to add flavor to the original movie script. And the voice acting clips taken from the movie are a nice touch to telling the story as well, as opposed to the silent approach of early LEGO games.By no means is LEGO The Hobbit without flaws, but if you're a fan of Traveller's Tales style of collect-a-thon games, this will be a shining Arkenstone in your collection. I picked it up for $5 on sale and more than got my money's worth out of it. Again, if you're tired of the LEGO formula or just really hate Tolkien it's probably a safe pass, but for everyone else, I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.Update:The Battle of the Five Armies DLCis confirmed to not be coming. Consider that sudden ending now a permenant black mark against the game. Still recommended overall, but something to consider."

It is a shame they don't make any DLC or new game for the third part of (The Battle of The Five Armies) but it is still a game with hours of fun, and i am shocked over how people are not recommending this game because it doesnt have the last part of the book (or the last movie). totally worth every hour, and I recommend this game for everyone who likes humor and The Hobbit!"

It is bad however, that the creators released it leading people to believe they would add TBotFA. Even if they weren't lying and actually were planning on adding it, they should have given a public apology or a little free DLC of something (maybe at least the TBotFA characters).But anyway, proceed. 👋 Lots to talk about here... Let's see...*Warning, this is very long, frens*~Mechanics~It's like all other Lego games in most ways; you go through the story of the movie the game is based on, destroy things and Lego studs pop out, you use them to buy characters and extras (red bricks).This game, however, adds Lego loot to the mix. Say if you destroy a barrel, boards will pop out and you can collect it. They go into your loot backpack.There are also Mithril bricks, collected around the large hub for use in forging helpful and sometimes purely cosmetic items. The Mithril Rhythm Stick (plays a dance song with some great bass and tune, also has lines from characters in the movie), and Mithril Catchphrase Mallet (with voice lines from the amazing Sir Christopher Lee) are my favorites.The loot feature sets it apart from other Lego games. I wish more Lego games had that asset.:Graphics:The game has really good graphics. The shadows and textures and water and all are really good. It runs smoothly and all the places look like from the movie/Middle-earth.:Missions:This game has missions similar to Lego LotR's. There are people in the hub wanting items forged for them. In return, they give you red bricks (extras you can turn on/off in the menu). Some red bricks are quite awesome. Lego Middle-earth Carnival is one of my favorites. It's an upbeat song featuring lines from the movie.:Hub:The hub is most of the Middle-earth that is in Lego LotR. It is entirely remade though. Everything is a bit brighter and ""happier' seeming than in LotR. The hub also seems scaled down the tiniest bit (mostly unnoticeable).The hub includes Hobbiton (Bywater, Barrow-downs, Elven Port near the sea), Bree, Weathertop, Trollshaws, The High Fells, Rivendell, The High Pass, Caradhras, Moria (outside only), Elven Forest (known in LotR as Lothlorien), The Carrock, Mirkwood, Thranduil's Kingdom (you can go inside to his fabulous throne!), Beorn's Homestead, Radagast's House (outside only), Dol Guldur, Lake-town, Dale, and Erebor (outside only).:Mounts:For use in the hub, this game has horses, ponies, wargs, and a DLC spider and Elk. The horses, ponies, and wargs are very customizable. They can be many colors with crazy patterns on them, Dwarven runes, spots, zebra stripes, stars, swirls, you name it.~Storyline~The storyline is like in the movies, but with Lego humor added. You play through all the iconic events in thefirst two moviesas the thirteen Dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf. In storymode, you also play as Legolas, Tauriel, Radagast, and Bard in a few levels. They ""goofy-ify"" things a bit, but that's Lego. Makes it funny. :PThere's Steam achievements as well, something I always like. =)~Characters~The game has 98 playable characters. There is the Company and many other rememberable characters from the movie to play as as well. Such as Thranduil, Lindir, Elrond, Beorn, King Thŕor, Azog, Bolg, Sauron, and Galadriel. There are also random Elves, Dale soldiers, Orcs, Goblins, etc...Most character with swords fightreallyboring... The only tall character one who fights really cool with a sword is Thranduil. Some of the Dwarves fight cool with their swords though, so that's nice.:Character Creator:The character creator in this game is alright, not the best. You can't give them weapons in the CC.Every time I get a Lego game I always run as soon as I can to check out the CC. It's a big thing for me, I like the creator to include many body pieces and weapons and things so I can make my own hero or create a character they didn't add to the game.I don't think it has all the minifig pieces from every character, but it has enough you can do a little something with it. It has lots of hair, including beautiful Elf hair, which I love. :PThe custom minifigure characters all act the same, they act like  Fili, not too bad. Can be a boy or girl custom character without looking really odd. I don't like it when the default ""acting"" for custom characters is silly. ( I wish you could choose who they acted like... *coughcough* *hinthint*)There is one major bug with the CC, however. You can create a character and make him have hair and no hat and it'll be fine for a while. But then after playing as the character or just playing the game (not even being them) whatever hat the selector was on will show up on the characters head, over their hair and get stuck. So if you want to play as your custom characters, you have to do it soon after you start up the game or a wild hat will appear. xDIn character creator conclusion, the only complaints I have with The Hobbits CC are:1.There are only four total tall custom character slots. I wish there were more tall ones, the shorter characters aren't quite as fun to make, I prefer more Elves and Men.2.You can't choose the acting of the character. So if you want to make an alternate version of Thranduil, he acts like Fili instead of himself... You should be able to choose how they act. Seems like it wouldn't be too hard to implement... .-.3.You can't give them weapons in the CC. The only weapons they can use are the ones you forge/collect. Most of them are silly (just not practical). There's only some halfway decent weapons if you buy DLC. And those weapons are Orc-ish and characters still fight boring with them. :/ But other than those things, it's a pretty good creator.~DLC~Go to the respective DLC pages to view more info on DLCs, I've reached the character limit D:I was hoping for a DLC including some characters from LotR not in this game. This game includes Tom Bombadil and he wasn't even in any of the movies, yet it leaves out Celeborn!-_- I wish there was a DLC that added Arwen, Aragorn, Gimli, Celeborn, Haldir, and maybe even Figwit! ;P⊗Well, that's pretty much it. Get the game to explore it all. :PIf you have the money and like Lego games and The Hobbit, I say it's worth buying even without TBotFA. It has a lot of content and gameplay even without TBotFA. People don't give the game enough credit for what itdoeshave, because they're too busy focusing on what itdoesn't.The gameistechnically complete. You can achieve 100% and get all the items and red bricks and characters and everything. The only thing missing is levels and characters for the last movie, but there isn't an empty place for it, it just doesn't exist. TBotFA would probably just be a lot of boss fights anyway. :P Maybe when they remake it later it will be more interesting. :^)Perhaps one day they will make a game called Lego Middle-earth: The Video Game, and it will include all of The Hobbit and the LotR stuff. =D Imagine how great that would be?!If they make that game, they may take their time! A hundred years is a mere blink in the life of an Elf! I am patient! I can wait! (refs tho <3)I rate it 9/10. Lego: The Hobbit is an awesome game, one of my favorites. If you like Tolkien's works, Middle-earth, the first two Hobbit movies, Legos, and Lego games, why are you still reading this? Go buy the game! =D"

The only person I would not reccomend this game to are folk with no controller compatible with your computer. The Keyboard and mouse controls are horribly unresponsive and it feels like you are playing with rocks. Plug yourself in an Xbox or Playstation controller and you've got yourself a fine gaming experience.lets go down on the Game itself. The music and soundtrack are directly borrowed from the movie(s) themselves and really put you in the event of where the game is taking place. For example the music in the dainty shire scenes is very tone down mellow folk music, while during epic battle we get music that fits well in with the battle thats going on.  As far as the atmosphere of the game goes, its very strong.The graphics of the game are actually insanely well put together, and the textures look better than most triple A titles released today. However on low graphics the game looks solid and is much easier on your pc. On the subject, the game is not well optimized for PC. I say this because my computer is very strong (i7 and 980) and it has to work much harder than it should in order to run this game on high, so if your computer is a total dinosaur, reconsider before buying at full price.When talking fully about the gameplay alone, its realitively simple and very similar to most lego games. Like other lego games they add more mechanics with each game. This game has a system of save and quit with a statue you can interact with in most levels, which is new for lego games as far as i can tell. This is definitly helpful because if you are buying this for a child you always have an answer for the ""Just let me finish this level!!"". More mechanics in this gamethat got added such as the building mechanic where instead of just pressing one button and building it, theres a somewhat involved process  to choosing and placing bricks.As far as the story goes I was somewhat dissapointed. This game does not include the 3rd movie and thus doesnt include the battle of the 5 armies. I wouldve thought they would add some kind of dlc but we got nothing. This is perhaps one of the only downsides to the only game and is actually pretty sad. However this lego game is part of the series of lego games that include voice acting, so you can actually feel for the characters and dont feel like you are on the outside of an inside joke like some other lego games. This game can actually tug at your heartstrings at certain moments and that suprised me.Overall the game was very well put together and would very strongly reccomend it. Also if you get any bugs turn on Vsync and that should fix them. So if you are looking for some casual game to blow off from steam and experience a beautiful story, look no further.7.5/10"

After all the third film was still good ways off before it would be released in the theaters. Personally I expected Traveller's Tales to introduce the third part somewhere between after the third film's theater and DVD release. Yet here we are even now with no conclusion with achievement saying ""To be continued..."". Because of that no matter how good this game is I cannot recommend it to anybody; it lacks the conclusions to a great tale.

And it's based of only the first two movies of Hobbit series.Yes, only from the first two movies. Warner Bros promised to whip Travellers Tales into making DLC based on the third movie, but then after a while they went all ""eh eh eh not planning to make any videogames based on the third movie"".Yea, store page of a game masterfully avoids any mention that it's not complete.It also came out on consoles that are Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, WiiU. And also had handheld version for 3DS and Vita which is your usual ""same idea, different lesser execution"" thing. Don't worry, from what I looked the PC version is among top.Technically, it's about on same level as recent Lego offerings. Or maybe even worse. You know, bugs, crashes and getting stuck in geometry. I do remember crashing at the end of level 5 personally. And many people complain about some bugs in overworld.Anyway, it's yet another Lego game. Casual, beat stuff, collect stuff. Watch funny cutscenes with voice overs. Do quests in open roam part. No revolution. Just same evolution of a snail.Like, this time around a lot of destructable objects now drop additional loot: various materials. And there are some objects into which you must dispense a certain amount of materials that you gathered. Then once done, minigame will happen where the Lego object is being automatically built, then it stops at some point and shows which detail it's going to build next and you have to select it from 8-directional choice. Or else time will run out, which only means that you get less studs. Yea, it still wouldn't make you think.Oh, and everybody can charge attack. Eh.Look, this franchise is so painfully stale. I remember Travellers Tales for creating charming games like Galladan, Toy Story for 16-bit and Sonic R. Sad to see that they pretty much turned into yearly licensed Lego games factory. That now makes quite buggy games. And this one isn't even full experience. Not to say that it has much less than others though.And there was so many games in Lego games that at this point you better approach it different from other sane game franchise: Instead of following Lego franchise, just pick the single game that fits your interest. And then don't care about others.Really, I know that there are other franchises that don't change things up at all. But the thing is that Lego franchise is designed to not require much thinking. So kids will be able to beat it. Though at times it might be offending even for kids. And thus ""almost reskin, more levels"" doesn't work here, like, say, with 8-bit Megaman. Just changing little doesn't work. It really gets repetetive for real. No challenge, no new think for each level.So eh. It still doesn't stop me from having to recommend it up, rather than down, as it's still a good game with some love and charm still being shown, Travellers Tales style.Enjoy your expected cliffhanger!"

The game has crashed on me a number of times, and I am now at a part in the story that I honestly don't know how I will get past due to the collosal bug. I need both characters (elves in this case) to pull down an item, so they both need to get to a certain point. Unfortunately, one of them even when I take control automatically goes to the left no matter what I do. She jumps right back onto a swinging bar, and if I try to go further left and then back to the right-she jumps off the edge...over and over and over. Basically, if you buy this game it is the luck of the draw. Either you will be able to do a full playthrough, or a bug will break the game for you. Also, apparently the game doesn't actually finish the story-a friend of mine mentioned this as he was able to finish the game, and that is also not very cool.

You let Smaug loose on Lake Town and then that's the end of the story mode, what about the battle for Lake Town and the Battle of the 5 Armies?! I know it is a Lego game designed for kids but when compared to the Lego: LOTR which starts off with the first big battle, it is clear that TT have the ability to be able to produce battles on a large scale. It just makes The Hobbit seem short and like a huge chunk is missing from the game!The gameplay is your solid Lego game which TT have nailed over the many years and Lego games they have produced. I would recommend playing with a friend as that is where the game becomes most enjoyable.There is now a loot system in the game which is a new mechanic for me, this allows you to build certain structures in the game to advance the story and the loot drops are frequent, so you don't have to spend hours travelling around the map looking for that one piece of wood.TT's usual humour is there and had me chuckling along in some cutscenes, in addition they have cut the voices from the films and one of myfavourite pieces is that Sir Christopher Lee is narrating the story as you go.All in all, a good game when played with friends!"

I only really play lego games for co-op, being one of the very few non-fight based ones. There is one co-op gimmic so far but that involves picking up the other player and holding them as you hit around - rather dull for the player being held! It is also quite hard to workout how it works initially. Indianna Jones had a much better co-op, you had to go places TOGETHER to do everything and I'm missing that.There is also an annoying mechanism you see in other games -run over hundreds of little bits gotten from breaking things to collect them and make an item. It's not badly done, it just isn't lego. Lego has a cauldron etc and 3 or 4 things to collect which you do very minor tasks for and physically carry them over. Lego LotR did this, and Harry Potter and even the most recent Jurassic World (which is also pointless for co-op) so why change now? Or rather why have BOTH?.Also, not everyone can push blocks, really? Though this is less of an issue than the above.I personally found it had less silly Lego humour than in the other games - hopefully this will increase as it goes on. Otherwise what is going on, it's Lego!All in all is it NOT a BAD game if you want to play alone, it is well made and pretty though some levels drag on  a bit.

As a die hard LotR fan I thought LEGO Lord of the Rings was the best LotR game ever made for making a realistic feeling open world middle-earth and capturing the feel of it being mroe of a journey or quest rather than hack n slah like all the other games we get. LEGO Hobbit does it exactly the same. Most of the levels will rarely feature more than acouple enemies to fight and consist more of utilizing the Dwarves' different skillsets to solve, albeit easy, puzzles. The boss fight against Sauon can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ though...good god that was annoying. Oh, and you also get to shoot orcs as legolas while balancing on the dwarf heads during the barrels scene just like the movies, definetly my favorite moment. The open world has gotten revamped. Eagles can now fly you to each of the main areas making for cool flying transitions. Dol Guldur, Thranduils Kingdom, Dale, and Laketown are all explorable (the goblin kingdom is not in the open world), some more limited than others. Lake Town's lake is wide open for you to sail around, although i haven't gotten around to it. The major new addition is of little caves that hold puzzles inside each to solve for collecting your bricks to craft all that mithril stuff just like lotr. Oh, you can also customize your own horses, ponies, and Wargs for free world riding. There's a fourth option for big creatures (troll looking) but I haven't unocked it yet and there's also create a character. Overall, it keeps intact the feeling of adventure and exploration that LotR is about, which is what makes it a great game for any LotR fan."

Bring a controller.Travlers Tales is nothing if not consistant. Starting with LEGO Star Wars, they hit on a formula that has served them well for years. The games are the best kind of collet-a-thon: rewarding exploration and the act of collection with useful or fun gameplay changes. That on it's own is delicious cake, but the thick layer of icing on that cake is the worlds they recreate, more or less faithfully, while editing the stories down to rapid-fire, goof-filled cutscenes that neither fail to deliver narritive or get at least one laugh-out-loud moment (average 1 per game). The LEGO Hobbit is no exception, though there are some new sprinkles on the LEGO game cake that make it less of a gameplay rehash than others in the series.The game is clearly built on whatever engine LEGO Marvel used, and the difference between LEGO LOTR and LEGO Hobbit is astounding. Moving and attacking are fluid, aiming ranged characters is vastly improved (read: it actually works), and non-lego environment's have gotten a graphical update. The ""Voice Acting"" from LEGO LOTR is back too, though MUCH better integrated into the cutscenes than it was in LOTR.Gameplay-wise, LEGO Hobbit brings a single twist on the standard LEGO formula that manages to mix things up a bit, and that twist is ""Loot"". Loot can be one of a few kinds of things that drop when Lego stuff is destroyed: several varities of gems and metals, several varites of food, and several building materials like ""Rock"". (You will have a lot of rock.) Metals and gems are usually aquired via a little reflex-based mining minigame, the others are aquired simply by destroying lego ""stuff"" and enemies. You can use this loot to craft items (Like crafting in LOTR, but slightly more involved) or to build larger lego structures at specific points in the world. You can also hord them, like a certain dwarf king, but that wont get you the mithril blocks or crafting patterns.Other than that, Lego Hobbit doesn't do anything too different. There's also the matter of it missing characters from the LOTR game, which is a bit of dissapointment, especially for the huge ensamble piece that the LOTR universe is. More of a dissapointment is that it only covers the first two Hobbit movies, with the third promised as DLC. While the game certainly stands on it's own, it's a much weaker sell at $30+DLC. If you absolutely can't stand having the story halted 2/3rds in, you might want to wait for the inevitable combo pack.All in all, LEGO Hobbit is a great addition to the series. It does just enough to keep it from being the same old thing again, while maintaining the polish and humor of the games before it. If you like Lego Games, buy it. If you're tired of them, you'll probably still be bored with this one.Also, PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER. This game is designed around a controller experience, and is uncomfortable to the point of unplayability without one."

The game is also a little buggy. The usual occasional lag (for PC players) and need for an xbox controller is ever present and throughout game play there was a couple of crashes I suffered.The last part of Peter Jacksons interpretation movie / The Hobbit story will be either DLC or a stand alone game as annouced by Take Two themselves this year (2014).So...onto the good.The odd bug aside, I found the game VERY fun to play and I ended up 100%ing it. It's well written (outside of the scope of the original story)  and has good voice acting (beyond the movie sound samples... Christopher Lee acctually narrates the game but even the lesser characters are fun in their own rights).It's certainly one of the better lego games and if you played and enjoyed the previous Lego Lotro game then you will have no regrets. For overall lego game fans its a must. For any one not familiar with any lego games...well..if it's on sale you'd be a fool to miss out!"

Minor stability issues.I get the distinct impression with this game they really wanted to expand on the usual gameplay of the Lego games (don't worry, the usual gameplay is all there still and if you like Lego games you will still like this one).  The addition of materials for crafting probably sounded great in theory, but in practise adding in a requirement to farm items from various sources coupled with terrain that enjoys sending said items spinning off the edges of cliffs was more frustrating than fun. It can be forgiven though because once you complete the storyline you can simply buy resources using your studs.I thought the way it used the mithril (gold) bricks to actually make stuff was also cool. Initially I thought this would cut down on time spent moving through the character selection screens, but since it takes just as long to select an item, some items refuse to equip if you have other items already equipped and some items repeatedly fail to work consistantly (flails for example), and your character returns to default if you switch to another character.. for the most part it was simply easier to switch characters rather than fight with your items.The red bricks are scattered around the game in the form of side quests and are indistinguishable from other sidequests making them hard to target. This makes it very hard to prioritise things like multiplier bricks and makes this the first game where I've completed it without hitting the achievements for studs - I actually had to go and grind some purple studs to get that achievement.The map and mini map are excellent, with the option to zoom in/out and set waypoints for quests/bricks etc. The main quest I'm guessing is based off the film which I haven't gotten around to seeing since I rather loved the book growing up and thus contains a bunch of stuff that wasn't in the original and inexplicably seems to be missing the ending, but it's still fun. The side quests are varied and there are bunches of chained quests which add a sense of continuity. They actually managed to make using the custom characters a part of the game as well which was great as that's a feature I normally entirely ignore.I've had the most stability problems with this game over all the others I've played. Although it never outright crashed and could always be rescued with a save and quit or eagle trigger I had it repeatedly freeze during travel, during forging when making multiple items and when purchasing new characters. There were also the problems with inventory items and for some reasons some items - most notably flails - simply refusing to work properly on some characters.Overall though it is very fun and since no loss of progress was included in the problems with it, they are entirely bearable."

The style of play is largely the same, certain characters can do certain tasks and so you'll go back to replay levels after you unlock a character who can deal with gold blocks or silver blocks or what not.For those who haven't played the LEGO family of games, it's a good 3rd person adventure romp with the occasional puzzle that is LEGO based and if you enjoy The Hobbit or Middle Earth Lore the game pretty much follows that. It's an incredibly ""safe"" family game in that you can let your 7 y/o play it and other than the ""violence"" of LEGO people falling apart, there's pretty much nothing objectional from a visual standpoint in the game. It's cute, it tells the story and is overall fairly enjoyable.There are a few levels that are long in the tooth, as in they take 30 or so minutes to get through them assuming you do all parts of that level. It just rules out a quick game and the ""save"" feature doesn't really save that level / dungeon / map, just your progress up to that point. No different than the previous LEGO games though.

I've completed all of them 100% since the beginning (excluding City Undercover for the Wii U) 'm working my way through this one and MARVEL atm and I can safely say that this one is one of my favourites alongside LotR. The gameplay is the same, which may annoy some people as it doesnt bring much new apart from a couple of new minigames, but TT games have taken the 'don't fix what aint broken' approach, which is a good step in my opinion. The dialogue is taken straight from the films, which is amazing! after watching the films and playing this straight afterwards you can pick out lines and pin point them in the films. Graphics are pretty decent for a LEGO game, probably some of the best I've seen in the franchise, although LEGO Movie looks good from the trailers (another one I havent played yet but intend to). The game is very loyal to the films but also includes area of the map and characcters that are only featured in the books, which is a great touch. My only critisims are that they have changed the map quite a bit scince LotR, I can see why, but as a long term player, it can get quite confusing when trying to navigate as im so used to that previous map, although im sure I will get used to it. My last bug bear with this game is that there is no Online Co-op. There is same system co-op, but I think that TT games should try to incorporate this into their future LEGO games as this would just make this game the best game on the planet (although its pretty damn close as it is). Overall, if you love LEGO and the LotR or Hobbit world, then this is a no brainer. Tbh, even if you dont particularly like LotR, you should still buy this just for the laughs and thrills you will get along the way :)"

Even when you finish them all, there's still more to find and experience, even if they're aren't exactly achievements for it, with plenty of mini-dungeons and interesting items to try out.All-in-all, LEGO The Hobbit doesn't disappoint, and only paves the way for when the last film is released and the game can be fully completed. In what way, whether as an update or as DLC, it's impossible to tell as of yet, but based on the encouraging content of the game as of now, we can only expect great things for the near future."

The hobbit laughs and walks under it.Lego the Hobbit (LtH for short) is another prime example of Lego's continuing creativity. This game has variety, action, adventure, questing, humor--all the things I've come to expect in their recent games. LtH is a decent retelling of the movie, which is a not-so-decent retelling of the original fictional novel by J.R.R Tolkien. Though this game was a pleasurable experience for me, I have to admit that it has some large flaws.First, the fact that this game only encompasses the first two out of three movies made by New Line Cinema. The Battle of FIve Armies was originally intended to be released as a DLC for this game, but Warner Bros. canceled this development. So now, we have a game that leaves off with a cliff-hanger, and no way to resolve that cliff-hanger besides watching the movies.Second, the character customization. Every modern Lego game has one--a place where you can create your own Lego figure, and play with them in the game. In the past, this was an amazing feature in Lego games. However, in LtH, the character customization is somewhat lacking. This game does not let you equip a weapon or cloak to your custom character (no capes I guess?). This was extremely disappointing to me, as outfitting my character with cool cloaks and weapons had been my favorite part of Lego games in the past. While the customizer in itself has no lack of Lego parts to use on your figure, weapons and cloaks are not allowed >:(Third, the difficulty of finding secrets. In the open world, secrets and mysteries abound. In previous Lego games, the variety of secrets was perhaps not as big (except in Lego LOTR), and they could all be obtained with relative ease. In LtH, secrets stay secret if you aren't extremely persistant. Just finding the blacksmith so I could craft mithril items took me the better part of two days. The instructions are rather vague, and certain puzzles and quests are extremely difficult to complete. This will be sure to annoy younger kids after a while.Aside from these three flaws though, LtH is an extraordinary game for younger kids into the lore of Middle Earth. The story is pretty decent, and the combat is satisfying without being bloody or gory. This is perhaps Lego's strongest point--the ability to create massive-scale battles that young children will be able to partake in without worrying about gory imagery or blood. Overall, this is a good adventure game, but I would recommend waiting until a sale to grab it. The DLCs are ok, but I'd wait until a sale for those ones too.8/10 a decent game."

It's unfortunate that as you play through the Single campaign, this open map is hardly used with levels teleporting you to the next section, skipping over the wonderful detail of the game. It feels like bad game design, as many places you would have had to walk though (in the book and film) you don't get to see or explore until you go off Piste (and that is normally after you have completed the game already.)This wouldn't be so shameful if the main story was solid. It's not. Six hours of playing and the game is over, finishing at the end of the second movie. Selling this game as ""the hobbit"" is a lie. It's a fraction of the story, and will never be finished.Another serious issue is the large amounts of bugs that were found during the 6 hours of main mission. Characters getting impossibly stuck, crashes to windows (that I also had with Lego LOTR and Lego Harry Potter but never have with other games, my system is stable). Some of the quests seemed impossible, and much time was spent wasted trying to solve something to only find out (after searching online) that I had encountered a bug and must set my resolution, vsync, graphics settings etc to something else to try to solve it.I only play Lego games because of the CO-OP, with my wife, but even she was getting frustrated by some of the bugs, quirks and oddities this game offered. One small example, being how when unlocking a new person you would be ""greeted"" with all the characters being displayed on the screen for about 20 seconds with no possibility to remove them. 17 seconds too long. Another is how when one character speaks to someone, the other can not view the map. There are many oddities like this that made the experience frustrating.Anyway, despite the bitter taste of a half completed game, and a bitter taste that the final third of this game will never be released I can still give a half hearted recommendation for this game when it's on sale. Wandering the open world was a lot of fun, despite glitches, and I do love the LOTR universe.But anyone who doesn't like collecting loot should avoid this game at all costs, and the main game feels cheap. low 6/10."

However it has a few hiccups in which I would only recommend someone to buy this game if on sale so they don't feel cheated. The combat with the wizards can be particularly frustrating since they don't always register how close an enemy is and shoot magic rather than meleeing a target. The boss-ish kind of battles would feel more epic if it was a little more challenging, since upon completion you are left feeling not too satisfied. The biggest gripe I have with the game is how it feels incomplete since it only inculdes the story of the 1st and 2nd movie.

But mindless is definitely a word I would use to describe both the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit installments of the Lego franchise.  While creative block-building and humor were the charm of Batman and Indiana Jones, the LOTR themed games seem overly focused on ""sticking to the script"" of Peter Jackson's oh-so-serious films by recreating the movie in Lego form.  You will sit through about as much cut scene as you will active game time, and the cut scenes chop up the game world in a frustrating way.  The Hobbit, in particular, seemed to have a lot of annoying repetition in its side quests, since Middle Earth is apparently made up of helpless trolls and orcs who want you to ease their way with more tedious mini games than you have patience to complete.  Oh, and those helpless inquisitors NEVER. STOP. TALKING.  You will want to leave the room instead of sitting through their speech on why they need a Mithril Potato Gun.  Boss Battles are just as mindless, as the screen tells you which buttons to pulse in order to defeat them.  It's worth playing if you like Lego games, but I would recommend Indiana Jones or Batman if you enjoy fun over tedium."

I should be playing it now, but with only two mithril blacksmith items made and 36% of the game content completed I have little interest in continuing since the story is over. This will make me think differently when I consider buying Lego games. If you don't have the story, you have nothing."

This game play is fun and is about what you would expect, that being said I could not imagine playing this without a controler. This game has plenty of mini games wile there isn't much veriety though they never really get boaring pobably because they are all fairly simple. I would gladly recomend this game to anyone expecialy if the like Lego games and the hobbit.I do have a few problems with this game but they are a little nit-picky. First though this may just be my computer or rather back up computer mine is out for repair and the one they gave me one that is sugnificantly less than the one I have (dell lap tops and there affinity for constant repair.) I digress the game seems to slow down where there is a lot going on at the same time. I found that the races were a little longer and mor complex not allowing for any recovery if you make a mistake in other words the are far less forgiving than most of the other games. At times mostly during races the camera will rotate wildly causing you to make mistakes leading ultimatly to frustration. They added a newish build mini-game sometime it is dificult to discern exactly wich peice it wants you to choose and I don't think that they give you enough time to choose the peices either. In this game they added mining wich can lead to farming but won't matter late game. My last complaint is that the game follow the first two movie meaning that it just kind of ends when Smaug flys off to Lake Town wich leaves you felling as though you didn't really accomplish anything."

I really like that they kept the level checkpoints and moreover give you direct access to them including a list of available items in said location (e.g. minikits, treasure items, blacksmith designs) making finding your missing piece a bit easier.  The new looting system has its merrits but is overall flawed in my opinion, works great for the buildables but sucks for forging unless you know specifically where to get any one item (Erabor after beating the last level smash the wall behind your characters for a purchase station, 10,000 studs for 5x any item).

I am life level 40, however im sure this would be very entertaining for children who are fans of the hobbit.The cool thing about this and other lego games is that you are pretty much watching the movie and playing out each of the important scenes. For example when bilbo has to free the horses from the trolls.It won't pull me from my normal games now that I have my internet back, but do yourself a favor and buy at least one lego title for a rainy day when you wont be able to connect.Note: Most important if you buy one of these games, buy yourself a usb game controller, they are only $15 - $25 for a decent one.

But once you finish the levels, and start on the remaining 3/4, it's just annoying. The camera swoops around at the slightest provocation, so that you either fall off what you were standing on, or can't see anything. Any character you control will automatically target the nearest NPC instead of the lego item you want to smash (Saruman himself is unable to attack anything he is standing next to; you have to walk away, then hope that the other character doesn't move to stand in front of it). Travelling is tedious; you will always start at the far end of the map (where the story ended), and going anywhere is slow and repetitive. Finally, the lego building thing that was so good within levels now slows down everything else you do. You want to forge a mithril item? Have you collected 50 carrots, a bunch of rocks, some copper, and a stack of red gems? Go do that first! You want to help a guy build a thing? Do you have 60 pieces of silver, and some wood, and some green gems?So, initially I'd have given it 8 or 9 out of 10, but my best estimate at this point (31% completion) is that it would be lucky to get a 6 from me."

Lego The Hobbit has no such problems, and benefits from the films' lighter atmospheres.The addition of mining elements certainly increases the potential complexity and length of the game, and if nothing else adds another excuse to bash apart everything you find."

This is partially due (I would think) to the 'open world' (and 'recipes' which as the previous reviews take into great detail).At first, it was genuinely  irratating. For example; during the game Gandalf and another wizard split off from the company of dwarves to 'explore'. So until the level was complete it was impossible to access other characters.All exploration has to be saved for the end, when you unlock the ability to switch characters on the fly (in the open world, much like a bigger free play). In a more positive light, it also means that that each area, that was quickly ran through, has a bit of welcome replay value.All in all, It is a fun game.

76561198045406666,Not Recommended,285160,16298053,"Posted: 10 June, 2015",all,KING_VIRTUAL,"I picked this game up on sale purely due to the nostalgia I had toward previous lego games (mainly Lego Star Wars). Those games were great in two ways. They had a lot of replayability for guy like me who likes to unlock all the characters. They also had a great sense of humor in regard to the source material.Let me explain that sense of humor a little. None of the characters ever spoke. They made sounds and displayed various cute animations thus showing the plot of the movie rather than telling us anything. As a result, those old games were great.While Lego the Hobbit does maintain its replayability, it lacks any of the sense of humor of the original games. Long cutscenes clutter the entire beginning of the game (That's all I've played), all of which are narrated. The narration takes away from the original style and replaces the feel of the original games with something that very clearly feels like I'm just being shown a worse version of the film.Furthermore, the old Star Wars games cost less than this and covered three movies (and 6 if you got the complete pack).  So if you do the math, $19.99 for a bad game covering 1 movie? Not a good deal.In conclusion, I give this 3/10.

I bought it without having watched the movie, and having greatly enjoyed the books. I was unable to tell which of the plot changes were made by Jackson, and which by Lego, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and I recommend the game. It's the usual funloving romp through Middle Earth that we saw in Lego: LOTR, with the same basic systems, including a large Middle Earth (without the zooming map; :( ). The difference is there are a lot of new minigames, tonnes of new stuff, and even an OP bonus level that will give you about 100000 studs in 3 minutes. If the game has a flaw, it's that Dori is a little too vocal, and, since you have to spend a lot of time playing as him (he has an essential ability) you are always hearing his 'hip' s and 'haw's. Also, Gandelf is terrible in combat, and the new Rage feature doesn't work, because you're not invulnerable while charging it. Otherwise, the combat is the best I've experienced in any Lego game ever. It's just so fluid, that I fell in love with it. Especially after hammer smashing an orc off a cliff.Oh, also, unexpected bonus. I found out you can play as Saroun, so I bought him, headed down to Dolgildur, and gave every annoying quest giver the boot!Great game."

I played through a while ago and couldnt wait to play the final installment and i will not be able to now. I payed for a game based on Peter Jackson's adaptions of the books and i havent gotten this because the devs/publishers refuse to finish their game.So buyer beware, this game is incomplete and is likely to stay that way."

I haven't seen the Hobbit movies unlike LOTR I had seen, but it didn't really bother me. It only made it hard to recognize the dwarf characters especially to select the correct dwarf for those ingame puzzles.Compared to LEGO LOTR this game brought in a few new things like the loot system which is fairly nice addition. Most breakable items drop loot like planks, stones, ropes and such. Also minable stones for minerals and other goods. These loots are used to build up stuff and completeing various side quests.Negative things about LEGO Hobbit:1. The map system is poor compared to LOTR. It is very hard to navigate and find what you want. It's bearable at best.2. Guide studs seem to lead you to dead ends more often.3. Game speed seems to vary alot like in a badly emulated console games on PC. Sometimes the map navigation magnifying glass goes wayyy too fast to select items from map. Also those lego building minigames the selection is sometimes ridiculously hard to make when the selector goes too fast. Not sure if this is a factor when mining stones, but they seem ok.4. Lots of little annoying bugs, like switching character just doesn't work unless you change a scenery by flying or something like that.5. Changing day/night time is annoying. First have to find a camp somewhere and then watch a stupid sausage grilling moment that takes too long.I would rate this game 3.5/5. It is a very good game with some minor bugs here and there."

After three or four Lego titles, it's kind of expected.  Same goes for times when the camera can't shift and you would very much like to try a task looking from another angle.

It looks like they were trying to expand upon LEGO The Lord of the Rings (Which I purchased on PC disc before i found Steam) by adding some of the characters from the lord of the rings (Sam and Frodo for example). My favorite thing about this game was the bonus level, Stone Giant Smash, I think. My only complaint is that you can`t be in the bonus level for say, an hour. It is such a fun level and the time limit is 5 minutes the get everything (1 million studs, as always) but the only way you CAN`T get 1 million studs in the first 30 seconds is by not moving, because the rock giant(s) you play as is(are) so huge you crush about 12 trees when you take just 1 step! Overall, a great game that i highly recommend to any LEGO, ME (Middle Earth) Fan, or just a plain gamer. RandoM out!"

The voice acting is taken straight from the films, so you know it's great, also often with added LEGO-style visual humour.It's brought more to the LEGO series since some of the older games, by having it largely open world with levels included, and with a basic loot mechanism.I do have one gripe, however, and that's the fact that the game only covers the first two films of the trilogy, with apparently the third to be brought in later as a paid DLC. It left a bit of a bitter taste in our mouths (I play LEGO games with my girlfriend) when we sat down to another evening of LEGO, only to find that we had but 10 minutes of story left.Other than that though, an excellent game. Really top notch. I would however, say to wait until it's not full price, or until they release it with the third film included."

How many more reasons do you need? Seriously though, its a little different from the other lego games as it has some degree of crafting, such as making keys to open doors, not just the mithril items like in Lego Lord of the Rings. Crafting loot is dropped by mobs and by smashing stuff in the game, sometimes requiring a particular dwarf with a particular tool, such as the pick axe to get jewels. Some puzzels are like lego building mini games, where you have to select the correct brick to complete a lego kit, on a timer. The combat is a little different too, with the buddy-up system, where you can get two dwarfs to join, (they either link arms or sit on shoulders) and then either swing them into the target, or throw them at it, always a giggle. Give it a go, I doubt you'll be disappointed."

As always with these games there is a wealth of content and an open world to explore. Sound track is beautiful but the voice acting could be better. And there is the problem of the game ending at the end of the events of the second movie in the Hobbit trilogy. I understand the problem of putting the game out before the third instament hit theatres, but doing this makes for an unsatifying ending to the game. Though I have to admit, credit to the company for knowing this problem and promising story missions for the third movie added on as dlc. But still, if I would have been in charge of the project I would have waited tell the third movie aired and released a full game. Reguardless of that problem, it is still a wonderful game worthy of buying whether you are a lego game fan or not."

This game stops after the end of Desolation of Smaug and the official word is that's the way it will always be. No Battle of the Five Armies DLC ever. Because of this, I've changed my rating to ""thumbs down."" Still a really fun game but the decision to abandon it before it was finished is pretty egregious.Note to future self: don't buy LEGO games of not-yet-concluded trilogies.___________________________________________________________________________________It seems they've finally got most of the bugs and glitches worked out of the Lego game engine. Lego Hobbit is just about my favorite one so far. I would say it is almost as good as Lego Star Wars. It does still have the INCREDIBLY tedious running around an overworld to get to the level you want to play (as opposed to just going into the next door in the cantina like in Star Wars), but there's not much else that has annoyed me about it.It does have dialog from the movie, which I hated in lego LotR but it's okay now. In LotR, the dialog took the place of the comical pantomime and Wile E. Coyote sign-making that gave the early games some of their charm. The Hobbit has both. The dialog from the movie is not overused (as it was in LotR), and it is accompanied by the funny grunting and there's plenty of Wile E. Coyote-style miming.Another thing I disliked about LotR is that it seemed too much care was taken to faithfully recreate scenes and locations from the movie. While Lego Hobbit does look and feel really a lot like the movies, it doesn't seem the same care was taken to make things look and feel EXACTLY like the movies. Which I enjoyed, because there are things in the game that I didn't expect to see and that's always good."

Though the main storyline is incomplete, there are loads of quests to complete in Middle-earth, so the game doesn't feel any shorter than other Lego games.

The only negative think is that there is NO gameplay of the 3rd movie. At first they said that they would make a DLC for it after the movie but now they say that they WON'T. So, if you like the Hobbit movies buy this game BUT only if it is on sale! Do NOT spend more than 10 bucks for it.<3"

The graphics are great, the world (like in LEGO LOTR) is beatuiful and magnificent and the characters are confusing at times (in the sense that all the dwarves look very similar so switching between them to get the one you need was annoying) but still very fun to play.HOWEVER, I completed the basic game within a day...less than a day, actually - yes there are all the mini missions and collectables that takes days on end to complete/find but I was disappointed that I had finished the story so soon. Very disappointed. In fact, EXTREMELY disapointed and here's why: the game ends on a cliff hanger - the end of Jackson's second film - THE FINAL AND CONCLUDING PART OF THE ADVENTURE IS MISSING!I mean, is this a joke? Are the game makers okay in the heador...what?Until the final installment is added to the game I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUYING IT. You're left completely unsatisfied.

76561198176590318,Not Recommended,285160,32725140,Posted: 24 June,all,Dwaine,"I really enjoy playing lego games.I would play for days on end if there were not so many glitches. everytime, I mean everytime I stop playing this game it is beacause of a glitch. Just before i wrote this review i started up the game and in the first level I played (in about a month) one of the characters decided not to show up to the party (gandalf (he is normally punctual!)). becasue gandalf was late i could not finish the level and so i stopped playing the game and finally wrote a review about it.I guess iut would acceptable if the game autosaved every 10 seconds or something like that, so that you could gust reload the game and you would be of to the races, but no, lego games use a system where you have to wait for the end of the level before you can save (to be fare they they occasionally have some mid-level saving systems). So what ends up happening is you sit down to play your lego game and a while later you have a glitch that makes you restart the level and all the ""accomplishments"" that you had gotten are gone. The more this happens the more annoyed you get and then you buy a cat.Just joking about buying a cat do not buy a cat becasue of me! Most people including me rather than buying a cat they stop playing the game and after a while they write a review so in total these games are Awesome i have so much fun playing them by myself and with friends but these glitches send me mad and i cannot overlook them. So in conclusion i would not recommend this game even though it has an amazing storyline and is really fun, I cannot justify reccomending this game becasue there are just too many glitches.Oh and also did i mention that they could not even be bothered to finish it! they have not included the stuff from the third movie.The one last thing that i would like to say about lego the hobbit is more of a statement. I will use a helpful metaphor to depict it. If you had a crossword puzzle that you wanted to give to all of your friends and you had one copy and a photo copier you would not copy the page and make a copy of the re-printed page and then make a copy of the re-printed re-printed page and so on, no you would make copies of the original to keep the integrity of the crossword. So what i am saying Lego should do is when making a game copy the first publication. For the hobbit copy the book and not the movie, this is becasue the movie is slightly different to the book and then the game is slightly different from the movie. The end result is that you have a game that is fairly different to the book instead of a game that is slightly different. Sorry that was a fairly laboured metaphor but i think you understand what i mean.Anyway i do not reccomend this game. That does not mean that you should not buy it just that i cannot recommend it to you. If you are willing to look past the problems it is an amazing game."

When fighting Azog in 'Into The Fire', after dismounting him, the next battle/Quick Time Event just loops infinitely. I do the button presses and when he should be 'staggered' and jump up to the ledge, he just re-initiates the QTE sequence."

76561198275154742,Recommended,285160,34195221,Posted: 12 August,all,SpicyNachos,"Being both a Lego and Hobbit fan, I had to give this a go. I didn't set very high expectations for this game and good thing I didn't. Often for every 5 good things there was at least one bad thing. With that said, here we go!Story: (8/10) *Spoiler Free*The story is what you would expect from a Lego game, following suit with the movies story line, often utilizing the movies dialogue throughout the game, while adding some humour now and there. Often the story is explained through short 1 minute cut scenes after each level, and sometimes explaining through short exchanges of dialogue during game play. Having seen the Hobbit trilogy, the game does a surprisingly good job of staying close to the films storyline. You delve into the world of Middle-earth (before Lord of the Rings) through the protagonist Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo and Company must set out to the lonely mountain to reclaim their homeland & treasure, which is guarded by a fire breathing dragon. The plot itself didn’t “blow me away” or try to add/take away from the original films. But they were cute, funny, didn't overstay their welcome, and overall got a good kick out of it.Gameplay: (9/10)Being a Lego game, I knew that if one thing had to get done right it was the game play. And what do you know it was actually some of the best since Lego Star wars. I felt like they did an excellent job adding a level of variety while keeping that familiarity from past Lego games. If you are not familiar with other Lego games, the premise is more or less a linear platformer / collectathon where you get from one end to the other whilst experiencing the events that took place in the movies. Of course the game is sprinkled with the occasional puzzles and bosses. But where I was really began to fall in love with the game is the ability to collect another material other than currency, minikits, red bricks, and gold bricks, you often use these materials to build objects to progress further in the level. This of course is really smart of the developers because it gave me more incentive to explore and smash things. Of course being a Lego game you can expect to see a huge roster of characters, purchasing abilities and weapons which can be unlocked after completing levels, going back and replaying levels with any character you choose so you can maybe get those collectables, a massive “open world”, and so much more! I don’t want to drag on forever so I will just say that the game play was not a disappointment and was definitely the strong point of the game.Graphics: (8/10)I’m a big old-school gamer, so I don't know if these are acceptable graphics for today’s standards. It’s no Uncharted 4, but it has some really nice textures, really cool lighting at times, lots of color, and a very simplistic look which is pleasing to the eye. I don't think this is where the game shines, and it shouldn't, it's a Lego game. So if you’re expecting a highly detailed world full of texture or color then you may be in for a disappointment.Difficulty: (4/10)Its not my place to say if the game is hard or easy, because people have different standards of what ""difficult"" even means. In my play through of the game however I found it to be mind numbingly easy. Often I felt the game was holding my hand, constantly giving me hints of what to do (Which you can turn off btw). Oh, did I forget to mention that this game has bosses? Yah! And the ones that were in this game were terribly easy. There are only like 5, but just thought I would let you know they were a big letdown. I think we all know that where the difficultly lies is not in the combat or enemies, but rather the puzzles. And to my surprise there weren’t that many, and the ones that there were consisted nothing more than activating a switch, moving a block, or building something. Which is a big let down because I knew the older Lego games had great puzzles.Verdict:My biggest gripe with the game however (and alot of others would agree too) that not choosing to include the third movie in the final game was a massive let down, and takes away from the hobbit experience. It felt more or less like an incomplete puzzle because we only got to play 2/3 of a complete story. But you know what, with how much content is already in this game, 100% would have been a massive over hall and would have made it almost overwhelming. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who may be looking for a fun action packed plat former / collectathon, or anyone who just wants to kill 7-10-ish hours (30+ if you’re going for 100%). This game would be especially ideal for kids seeing as the difficulty is insultingly easy. Lastly I just want to note that playing with a controller and friend is recommended "
