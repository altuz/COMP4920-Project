If you never played this in your childhood, your parents probably didn't love you or you weren't old enough to comprehend how awesome this was/is, Now you can experience it whether you played it back in the day or are new to this!! Have fun building awesome rollercoasters that visitors are to afraid to get on, that took you an hour to create! You can build cool food courts with fountains and flowers with a random pyramid built in the middle because WHY NOT!?! its all to make your park looks cool! You can also build death traps! do you remember those visitors to afraid to go on you really cool rollercoaster that took you forever to make!?! why don't you just go kill them off by build a rollercoaster that launches them into the air and then they hit the ground in a ball of flames! That will teach them next...well it will teach the other visitors!!

76561198019205444,Recommended,285310,13928271,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,sitebender,"Roller Coaster Tycoon: Deluxe is an isometric tycoon game where you manage your own them park. Not just one, but each of the game's 70+ scenario is a different park. The scenarios get broken into four different categories: original, loopy landscapes, corkscrew follies, real life parks and extra parks. There is no fast forward button, so you're stuck going at the same pace. A game year would be an hour of real life time and several scenarios go between 3 - 4 hours. Each scenario has success conditions like have X amount of people in your park by year 3 with a rating of over 600. Others are more complex like double the park value without taking out a loan. Then after the time expires, you can keep playing if you'd like. There is around 210+ hours of game in these scenarios.As the manager of the theme park, you can plop down rides. From there, you can paint them, change their music and entrances. Even change different options on each one like how many times does a Ferris wheel go around? You'll build walkways to get to places and lanes to get to ride entrances. Without lanes no one will stand in line. The longer the lanes, the longer people need to wait in line. You can even raise and lower terrain, add water all at a price.The joy here is designing your own tracks. Roller coasters, go carts, flumes, slides and every other type of track. The game comes with premade tracks, but you can design your own as you go. Couture them to your land, have them dive into tunnels, over walkways. Heck design them to launch the trains off the track to kill people. This is your game, you do what you want. Just don't expect anyone to ever ride a crashed roller coaster again. You can even take away bridges to drown your patrons.Building the tracks is fun, there are a lot of roller coasters to chose from. Standing steel, sitting steel, inverted steel, wooden, twisting steel, diving coasters that can drop at 90 degree angles, hanging steel and far too many others to list. Different rides have different needs. Some need to be a smoother ride with less sharp turns. Others like the wild mouse roller coaster need sharp turns everywhere. The only down side is you make it as you go. There is no way to construct your perfect coaster, then add it into the game like you can with Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. You can still save any track design to your premade tracks to use at a different time.Each ride has stats broken into three categories, excitement, intensity and nausea. Every patron has their own stats. If they're looking for something calm, intense or exciting. If your ride is 18 loops back to back with an excitement stat of 23, but an intensity level of 23, don't expect many riders. If rides are too gentle, like kid slides and bumper cars, you'll hear about it. You need to pace things, blend gentle rides next to thrill rides. The more nauseating the ride, the more people will throw up unless you have enough benches outside the ride exit for them to sit down on.If someone throws up, you'll need to hire handymen to clean it up. They'll also water gardens, mow grass, empty trash cans and so on. You can even set the land they cover. When your rides break down, you will need mechanics not just to fix them, but inspect them. This ensures rides run with less down time and no one randomly dies due to brakes cutting out and one trains smashes into another. There are security guards for when patrons get too angry. Costumed characters can get hired to keep people happy while they're waiting in line.Decorations also boost patron enjoyment. Plant flowers near walkways, statues near lines, plants and trees next to rides. Its all up to you. Decorations next to a ride will slightly increase its excitement value. For the most part, designing a ride track under, over and next to either itself or a different ride will boost its excitement level. With enough effort, you can make a merry go round into an exciting ride, but its easier to make anything else in the park exciting.There is a thought view of everyone in the park, so you can determine what the people want. Are they hungry? Thirsty? Sick? Do they need to 'go?' Well then build food stalls, drink stalls, benches and bathrooms. There are a lot of different stalls and you can set the price on everything in the park including setting all your drink stalls to charge the same price. Not just that, but there are plenty of merchandise stalls full of things for your patrons to buy when they're happy enough.So how do you get different stalls, rides, coasters and decorations? You devote X amount of dollars each month to ride development. Minimum, medium, maximum or no funding at all. This will be how quickly you'll unlock something for the park you're managing. There are even check boxes for what you want to research. Gentle rides, thrill rides, roller coasters, shops & stalls, scenery and ride improvements. Ride improvements are simple things like putting a wooden roller coaster train backward.The game is very flexible when it comes to finances. Each scenario will usually start you off with a hefty bank loan that has minimal interest. You can get a bank loan up to a certain amount, depending on the scenario. Having money always lets you keep playing and growing. If you outgrow your park, then just buy land tile by tile. Its a little tedious, but whatever. Sometimes you need to buy rights to have your coasters go over roads, because you can't buy the land itself. While you can charge money for each ride, you can also make them all free with a park entry fee. Some scenarios force you to do certain things financially. The restrictions, coupled with the different parks make it interesting. Instead of just having the perfect park over and over again.On top of that, there is promotion for your park. Pay X amount for park or ride marketing for X number of weeks. Free ride vouchers, free food, half price entry for the park and so on. Its all to draw people in when you need it. Without patrons you can't make money, but all you really need are fresh rides. Old rides start breaking down more often. People visit them less in favor of newer rides. No one wants to spend $4 to ride your 3 year old roller coaster and so on.The patrons themselves seem pretty dumb. They'll walk in circles, so I've found straight lines are the best way to get them around the park. In one of the expansions of the deluxe version, there is a no entrance sign that you can post. People can't enter, but they can come out. Its helpful, especially for scenarios that start you in a park that has dozens of paths. Patrons get lost and start destroying things.I've owned Roller Coaster Tycoon for 15+ years. Its one of the first PC games that I bought with my own money after playing the 3 scenario demo. Not just that, but then I proceeded to buy all the expansion packs. I've completed the game on 5 different computers. I am big into management and tycoon games and I think this is one of the best if not the best.Even though a lot of people enjoy Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 more for its much larger parks, I still like the original better. I still feel its the best management game, but I can understand that the game can play itself at some point. You can walk away for two hours and come back with the scenario completed. Unless of course a roller coaster explodes or something. Its a relaxing low stress game, even if you're put in charge of a place that people could die... and you can kill them."

Let's answer some questions.""What is this game?""Rollercoaster Tycoon is a franchise where the player becomes an amusement park owner with the power to create tracks, customize everything from the terrain and decor to the ride names and colors, and even charging people to use the BATHROOM. Great idea. Think the sims, but without families and more workers and rides.""Any ACTUAL skills I can get from this game?""Yes. Balancing out a budget is seen by the money amount you are given in loans. These allow you to buy rides, stands, construct in general, advertise, et cetera. These loans CAN be paid off so you can run the park and not have your money taken away every month for loans. Also, there is keeping things cleaned/organized. The park gets awards based on how you run it, ranging from ""Safest Park in The Country"" to ""Worst Looking Park"". In order to keep good PR, you want to hire some handymen who sweep up all the vomit and trash people leave lying around.""Anything popular come out of this game?""I WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDEI WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDEI WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDEI WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDE""Why not just RCT3?""RCT3 is just, eh. It's hard to explain. RCT3 is not a bad game at all, trust me, I own that one as well and its fantastic. But, it will never have the same bouncy feel the early ones do. RCT3 is more calming and orderly. RCT 1 and 2 are bouncy, chaotic, and generally more enjoyable. In the earlier games, you get more of a RCT feel and less of a Sims. The gui in RCT3 even looks like the Sims. Still tho, try both and see which is your cup of tea.""DLC?""get out""Any bugs?""The game is being updated constantly due to being on steam, mainly in language support from what I've seen, but that doesn't mean its lost some if its old bugs. Sometimes, mechanics pay no attention to rides and they just get fixed on their own by some means. Guests still just wander off park when you delete the path they're on instead of finding another path. RCT was made in 1999, so its not really a suprise when these things happen. You just have to push them in the right direction and it's all figured out (by that I mean pick them up and throw them at the ride's enterance until they get it RIGHT).""Is the music good?""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ yes.You can set music differently for each ride, so if you don't appreciate one song, just pick another!----------------------------------------------------------------------------Basically, get this game. You will not regret it."

And yet, I always made sure to remove the ""mow grass"" from their job descriptions; keeping it meant your handymen would be off mowing instead of doing everything else. And yet, I always felt bad for the grass; was it really right to neglect it, simply because of a minor inconveniance to my park? So I always hired one more than I needed, and made his only job being to mow grass. 35$ monthly, earned solely through his sweat and his lawnmower. Off in the unexplored regions of the park, where nobody can even see the grass he's mowing. I always made sure to give him a absurd name.Around 10 years later, I find myself tracking Dorkle's adventure through the wilderness, chronicling his neverending battle against the grass, as I try to find a good spot for the next ferris wheel.10/10 would relive cherised childhood memories again."

That's not to say this game is without faults. One of the bigger problems is the limitation of scenery.

,Recommended,285310,23698843,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,Wings & Strings,"RCT Deluxe is one of those rare old gems that, no matter how much people try, has yet to have a spiritual successor fully recapture its essence or innovate in a meaningful way, and the reason for that is in the game's fundamentally brilliant design: it's a concise, well-balanced blend of extreme customization and structural rigidity, two seemingly-conflicting ideals that are perfectly intertwined. Coaster design, park layouts, scenery, and other aspects offer near-infinite variety, but the isometric view and deceptively simple and intuitive grid system offers a very acute precision to coaster refinement that allows a player to master the art of designing and redesigning coasters.The game's primary focus is on the creation of your very own amusement parks in one of dozens of locations, each with their own distinct goals. To be successful, one must learn how to keep their guests happy by providing them with an assortment of pre-built rides, stalls, and utilities as well as custom roller coasters and other rides that the player must design using a user-friendly ride editing tool. This and other tools offer the player complete control over the ride's track, trains, thematic elements, and price. The player must be considerate of their guests' ride preferences, as every section of track and the overall route will affect three ride statistics: excitement, intensity, and nausea. Learning to design coasters with these stats in mind is a fun and challenging puzzle in itself, and it has a major impact on a park's overall success.Beyond the fundamentals, after the game eases the player into the basics of park management, each new unlocked park objective teaches a new skill and provides new challenges for the player to test their ability to adapt. The absurd amount of campaigns, contents, rides, scenic options, and other items allows for literally hundreds of hours of fun just to get through all the campaigns at least once, and no two feel alike. Furthermore, while certain methodologies and techniques are sometimes encouraged, the game allows for all sorts of individualistic play styles and different approaches to the same hurdles, so it always feels like strategic and creative problem-solving, not memorization or repetition. Challenges are always present, but they are fair and well-crafted in their structure, so you are always encouraged to improve.Visually, the game has aged extremely well, and the sprites and assets all look and function beautifully. The game is coded in Assembly, so modding will likely not be an option, but the game's performance is always top-notch. Be sure to check that this version of the game is compatible with your OS before you buy it, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone. It has superb replayability and is always as fresh and exciting as the first time you played it as a little kid. If anything, it's probably more enjoyable today, given the ability to revisit and appreciate the complexity of the game's design with the mental sharpness that comes with adulthood.Granted, there are occasional small issues with path-finding and staff location assignment as well as the occasional imprecision of the algorithms for calculating ride stats. However, none of these concerns are close to game-breaking, and a bit of extra forethought and experimentation can avoid most if not all of the effects of these, thus the limitations of the game encourage you to work more effectively within those limits. For example, careful planning of main paths, kiosks, queue lines, and facilities can ensure that guests' needs are catered to, and assigning staff locations based on footpath traffic and ride exit access can ensure that rides and paths are always maintained in a timely manner. As of this review, I've clocked over 100 hours into this game, and I absolutely cannot wait for the next 100 hours.My final rating is 9.8 out of 10. This game was a labor of love, and it really shows."

,Recommended,285310,11011761,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,lovinglife139,"Where to begin? RollerCoaster Tycoon is arguably the best tycoon game of all time. The game's development was mostly credited to only one man (Chris Sawyer), and was released in 1999. There were four games that defined my childhood. The Sims, Age of Empires II, Dungeon Keeper 2, and this.RollerCoaster Tycoon truly gives you the power to make exactly the kind of amusement park you want to build. Even in the scenarios, it largely feels like a free building game; the game does not ask you to do anything you don't want to do. For example, instead of asking you to build a park based on nothing but rollercoasters like some games might have implemented, Rollercoaster Tycoon simply plops you down on a plot of land and basically says, ""Get this many guests and have a good park rating in three years. Have fun and buh-bye!"" This game should be truly applauded for being a tycoon game that is not only great fun, but never turns into a chore by forcing you into situations where you feel you're only doing something to beat a level. It gives you an end goal, and it's up to you, the player, to decide exactly how you'll get there.The game allows you to build your own rollercoaster, water slide, log flume, monorail, railroad (and many more) designs from scratch, which gives you endless possibilities in each level (and you will be playing levels over and over again simply for the fun of doing them multiple ways). You can build these rides around one another, underground, over water...there are few limitations. You can also decide what color themes each ride has (or not), even down to making each car in a rollercoaster train a different color. Also, put shops and food stalls around your park and decide how much to charge. You can even charge for guests to use the bathroom, bringing out the greedy capitalist in each of us (I usually make a profit over running costs with my bathrooms, charging just $0.10 per visit).You can even name guests and track them, which brings another level of fun to an already ridiculously great game. Read a guest's thoughts, pick him up and drop him in front of a ride you think he'll like, see what things he's bought from your park that are in his inventory. Hey, you can even drop him in a lake if he's so angry he's potentially messing with your park rating and drown him. It's up to you!RollerCoaster Tycoon is also, in my opinion, better than its sequels. Other than some rides not being available in some levels, it will never revoke your abilities. In RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, there were levels where you had to meet a scenario goal without charging any entry fee for your park, for example, which only ended up taking freedom from the player's hands while pushing itself into the ""chore tycoon"" category. RollerCoaster Tycoon never crosses that line.In summary, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a fantastic classic game that is perfect as it is. While the graphics may be simplistic by today's standards, it would be simply ignorant to pass up the game because of it. This game is fun, relaxing, rewarding, timeless, and close to flawless. If you don't yet own this game, pick it up. Otherwise, the only one who is missing out is you. ;)"

The fact that the game is still a ton of fun is what led me to play it for more than 100 happy hours in 2016.

A classic that I grew up with, and was amongst the very first games I've played in my life, so it was an instant buy for me, alongside RCT2.Here, like the games after it, you manage a theme park, and try to keep the rating as high as possible, and basically keep your visitors happy. (And if you so wish drown those who don't like your park, just to set an example)It's a fairly simple, and straight forward game that you can sink many, many hours into trying to manage your park, create the ultimate rollercoasters, and keep profit up at the same time.This game, unlike it's successor Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, has unlockable scenario's. You start with several scenario's, and work your way up (or down) from that, trying to get to the very bottom of the list. There's three lists of unlockable scenario's. One for the vanilla game, and the other two are from the expansions Corkscrew Follies and Loopy Landscapes, so if you're a completionist; you'll be sinking many, many hours into it!Other than that, the game has aged very well since when it was released back in 1999. So do you like managing parks, creating rollercoasters, completing scenario's to progress and having countless of hours of fun?

The focus of this game would be the missions, which usually requires you to have at least a certain number of guests, and at least a certain park approval rating.On the first couple missions, there's hardly anything pre-built, or in your way, so you can just keep playing those on a loop, or continue them after you win to build the park of your dreams. Some of the later missions have a lake or something in your way, or maybe a park with rides in it already.

Hire staff members to keep your facility clean, and if you like murder whenever someone pukes... DROWN THEM!!!

,Recommended,285310,10293260,"Posted: 30 May, 2014",all,Ordinary,"Oh man, here we go.Before I start my review of this game, I would just like to say that I have been a fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series ever since I started playing it when I was five years old, and the first game will always be in my memory. Alright, lets get this review on the roll.Ever wondered what it would be like to run your very own amusement park, to build rides at the click of a button, and such, then RollerCoaster Tycoon is definetly for you! RollerCoaster Tycoon is one of the best PC games of all time, and it deserves it's place in history as it. The story as to how RollerCoaster Tycoon began was when Scottish video game developer Chris Sawyer, who developed the legendary Transport Tycoon, was planning on making a sequel to the previously mentioned game, but when in the process of making it, Sawyer developed a keen interest in rollercoasters, and with that being done, he shifted his focus from that to making RollerCoaster Tycoon, and thus, a masterpiece was born.The basic gameplay of RollerCoaster Tycoon is simple. You're tasked with a specific park of your choosing, and your job there is to reach the goal that is given to you at hand without completely destroying the reputation of the park itself. This can either mean to achieve a certain park rating, amount of guests, and other such tasks that can keep you busy for a while, and with that being said and done, it's time to start building!You mainly play from a thirdperson view of the park itself, and you can build whatever you want in it, as long as you have sufficient funds. The game has a variety of different attractions to build, ranging from the gently ferris wheel, to the pulse-pounding steel roller coaster. Doing all this is very fun and addicting and can keep you occupied for a very long time. Since this is also deluxe, you'll have some extra fun with additional scenarios to play in, so you can be sure to have endless hours of gameplay. As the ""Tycoon"" that you are, building all these rollercoasters, rides, stalls, scenery, and paying all your staff in the park is costly, you'll need to be more careful with what you spend your money on, or else you'll need to start taking loans out, and that's never a good thing. With all being said and done, RollerCoaster Tycoon is one of the best games of this generation, and a must have for everyone of all ages.In conclusion, RollerCoaster Tycoon is definitely a must own, and is a materpiece that could never be remade."

Easy to learn, but with a lot of room for improvement especially with the development of bigger and better rollercoasters (learning what works with what type of coasters). All-around a very fun game with one shortfall: a lack of different challenges for the various parks. Most of the time it's just have this many people in your park by the end of year (insert year) and a park rating of (insert park rating). However, don't let this deter you from purchasing this game.

I would sink endless hours into this game as a kid, and as computers got newer getting the thing to work was harder and harder. Then steam came out with this! Completely worth the 6 bucks! And it even has the 2 expansion packs to boot!This game is old, so bear in mind it's isometic rather than 3D so if you are used to a free-form camera you may need a moment to adjust to having it locked at 90 degree angles. However, I never found myself struggling to place objects because of the camera.The AI is.... not the best.  Your park layout has to be, for the most part, a strait line or a large circle.  Otherwise your park guests get lost. However, I don't find this takes away from the game. Placing information kiosks and using monorails or chairlifts help with this ""guest 102 is lost and can't find the park exit"" nonsense.A great feature is any alert it gives you, good or bad, you can bring the camera to that spot. Lost guest? pick him up and show him the park exit.Despite it's age the coaster design part of the game is still my favorite.  A good variety of coasters, options, designs, I can truly build the monster coasts of my dreams. And make incomplete ones that rocket guests to their dooms like a total sadist.If you were a fan of the game a a kid, totally dive back in it's a wonderful game.  And to anyone curious about trying it for the first time, it's an excellent simulation game and you really can let your creativity shine.ONLY issue I ever encountered: The game will strobe if you have the program F.lux running. This is a program to dim your monitor to yellow-toned colors at night to reduce eye strain.  But it's incompatible with this game. All you need to do is disable F.lux before firing up the game and you will have zero issues."

Now that I've come back to it I've been having a lot of fun getting to all of the parks I could only dream of unlocking. It does have some strategy to it, but I feel that as you go through each park you learn something new about the game. I lost my original disk, so when I saw that it was on steam for such a low price I bought it immediately.There's only a few problems, most of them technical.1) steam overlay and screenshots don't work, plus I have no idea where to find the built-in screenshots folder2) once you leave the game or alt-tab out, opening/minimizing/closing windows becomes weird, and the only fix I've found is to restart the computer3) there isn't a real sandbox mode. RCT2/3 are the better sandbox games, so take a look at those insteadDespite all of this though, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves building or simulation games."

Nevertheless, it's addicting and very fun, an easy way to waste hours. You run a theme park and can make a ton of rollercoasters, stand/shops, trains, farris wheels and other stuff, you can every create you own roller coaster from scratch just make sure you park go'ers enjoy it as in it doesnt make them too nausious or have the que line too long that they get tired of waiting. Very fun, especially for when it came out,. Graphics were good for the time it was released but now have a limited screen resolution rate. Don't be suprised when only half your screen is filled when you play this if your playing in 1920x1080, and this is when it is ""fullscreen"" which is the only option, there is no windowed view but really how many people actually use that.

You add rides, rollercoasters, eateries, facilities, etc.  You must recruit handymen (absolutely vital as the park guests hate the site of sick on the ground!), engineers (your rides will breakdown regularly) & security guards (vandals exist you know).The best aspect though, is the designing of your rides.  Some are set, such as the Merry Go Round, but others, such as all the rollercoasters, the log flume etc, you can either accept pre set designs or have a go yourself.  Piece by piece.

This game IS my childhood, it wasnt a part of it, but it was my life as a child.RCT has taken a huge chunk of my life away, as I have spent thousands of hours creating parks, creating scenarios and editing custom content. And im here to tell you after nearly 16 years of gameplay, why you should buy and cherish this relic.The objective is simple. Build the theme park of your dreams. But it goes much deeper then it seems. There's staff to manage, bills to pay, capital to gain, advertisements to be used, and new rides to be build. RCT is simply not a reskin of Theme Park, it's a buisness simulator underneath a Theme Park simulator. It's extremely open ended and there is no TRUE endgame, other then beating all the parks. It is litterally endless thanks to the support of custom content and scenarios that are always popping up through the internet.Many people have complained about the steam port lacking compatibility with Windows 7/8. I have yet to run into any serious issues with the port. The only thing that HAS YET to work is the Steam Overlay, but it's to be expected.In all, Buy the game. Play it, introduce your children to it. Enjoy it."

Enough said.In all seriousness, nostalgia does cloud our perception, and I don't play a lot of simulation games, so I may not be the best person to review this game since I don't have much to compare it to. I haven't played more than a few minutes of the sequels and games by other companies inspired by the series like Planet Coaster. Those are probably a better option if you're looking for a modern experience, as this game definitely is a bit dated. Still, for its age, I don't feel that the UI is too clunky or the learning curve is too steep. Fun to pick up for a couple hours exactly once, or to dump days into, if you have that kind of time.I never did fully understand a lot of the roller coaster-specific mechanics, like intensity and excitement, which can be limiting when I'm trying to make a park the best it can be. The track builder is a bit clunky, too. Still, I'm a lot better at the budgeting and management aspects than I was when I was a kid, and the game can still be easy or challenging depending on the scenario. The quirks and flaws are a drop in the bucket of nostalgic goodness. Or lake. Lake of goodness, which your guests can fall into and drown."

(1920x1080 screen for my laptop, but 1280x768 monitor for my computer). Honestly though, I'm amazed it still runs at all, seeing how old it is.Obviously there's a few issues with the game; the inevitable station brakes failure, handymen automatically mow grass when you hire them (and their pathing is just AWFUL), no banked cornered hills / drops, everyone is extremely stingy with spending money on rides once they get a few months old... I don't care, it's still a great game. The scenarios are really easy, and pretty fun to replay on a semi-regular basis honestly.RCT2 is technically way better, but this is the OG. This started it all. If you love this, I'd recommend also getting OpenRCT2 and trying out playing with others online. Oh yes, that's a thing. And you can play the old scenarios on there too.

Sure, the graphics are extremely simple but that is to be expected for a game of its age. Plus it does not feel terribly dated since the artwork is somewhat stylized. The only other potential downside I can see is that the gameplay can seem rather repeditive but that is to be expected from a game based on a singular purpose.

RCT1 is as good a game as it always has been, and I daresay it's one of the greatest ever made.  When Steam offered the nomination for the ""Test of Time"" award, I thought very briefly of X-COM... then ignored that thought and went straight here.  Then I took that award back, so I could give it to the game again.==Made by a single person, and with NO ENGINE (the entire game is written in Assembly), Chris Sawyer's Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 fall under the definition of a masterpiece.  They play well, run smoothly, and have all sorts of great features that other tgames wouldn't catch up to for years.  When SimCity 2000 and 3000, and even 4 were simply running cities with fake-people sprites occasionally walking around, RCT had something only Bullfrog had succeeded in-- a management game with AGENTS.Every single one of the people in your park are active.When they're idle and bored, they find something else to do, and the guest count can reach well beyond even 1000 guests.  They're never inactive, the performance never tanks; it pulls off the simulation of thousands flawlessly.  IN 1998!What makes this game stand out so much from older titles, however, is the clean interface and visuals.  The isometric graphics still hold up rather well.  The performance is at a stable framerate constantly, and while I'm not sure where this cap sits, it's at least 40 FPS and never drops.  The interface is neatly organized, and every time you click a menu, it IMMEDIATELY pulls up that menu with an accompanying sound.  It also behaves like Windows, with windows appearing per menu that can be dragged around the screen freely.  It actually LOOKS like a game instead of an alien interface, something that can't be said about other classics like X-COM and Theme Hospital.Perhaps what draws me to the game the most, however, is how you're genuinely building a world in it.  It doesn't have much in terms of background music, and at first, the parkfeelsempty; however, you start placing your rides, give them selective background music, and extend your park.  This music adds up to build an atmosphere.  Then, your new guests will make noise.  You'll hear the clanging of capitalism and greed every time a customer buys something, and your guests are louder depending on how many there are.  Coasters going downhill with passengers will have them scream.  You'll also see them very well-animated-- they'll walk around, they'll pull out umbrellasif they bought one for $20 at one of our kiosks... heh heh, they'll throw up if they get sick.  Yeah, their 'tasks?'  All based on their own selfish desires.  They'll want to be happy, need to be awake, need to use the bathroom, and can't take motion sickness.  Their actions all change based on these stats, and it's in your best interest to accompany them all.In reality, I'm making the game sound more complex than it is to play.  These mechanics are slowly introduced to you, and I played this at a very young age without a tutorial; it just doesn't suffer from the usual complexity problems of these old games.  If you need it, there's a tutorial that consists of watching someone play in real time, essentially a demo of Chris Sawyer taking over the mouse and playing for you.  You can hit Escape to take control at any time, but assuming you don't you'll get to see where all the options you need are.  In reality, however, the game won't take too long to figure out for the most part.As far as replayability value goes, you just shouldn't be concerned.  There's several challenges to go around, playing with the game rules in various ways by giving you a task and either a piece of land to build on or a prebuilt park in its early stages to improve.  You will NOT run out of content-- in all my years of playing this game, I still have yet to clear through all the scenarios, and Forest Frontiers will always be a special memory to me.====================BUY THIS GAME.  It hasn't aged at all.  It's still better than any modern sim... SimCity 5, Cities Skylines, and Planet Coaster all fall short in some areas that this game nails, despite all being good games themselves.  Its compatibility is near-perfect (and if by some odd chance you run into an issue, there's a lengthy guide detailing workarounds and solutions), and a hexeditor widescreen hack is out there if you need it.If I don't end the review here, I would ramble endlessly about all the things this game does right, but as it stands the best way to do that is to experience it yourself.  The Steam release is a simple port, true, but nonetheless the game looks and runs perfectly.  It stillisa highly innovative and organized game, and few things stand in the way of showing off its strengths.Pick it up, for your own good, and try it yourself; whether it's the full track editor allowing you to build custom rides and coasters, the atmosphere-building sound design and gameplay design decisions that help it feel like a living world, the management of your finances and distribution of staff to keep the park at max efficiency, or the morbid prospect of drowning panda-costumed staff and throwing coasters into the lake, or perhaps any combination of the two, this is a game you simply must play."

Since this is the steam edition and not the actual disk you gotta admit this game is cheaper than it should be. And this game was made in 1999! The special part of this game is that you get to let your imagination free of building an amusement park that works in the game. Rather if you wanted to build a Wooden Roller Coaster or an Inverted Roller Coaster, etc. And when you are done beating the objectives to the amusement park you could just kill them all! Rather if you wanted to drown them or make them CRASH on a roller coaster and as you could asume many other ways (just make sure you turn down the volume when you are doing this because it will hurt your ears with notifications). Therefore this will be one of the games that I may never forget.If you want to want to see what the game is like before you actually buy it here is some videos by a youtuber known as KYRSP33DY that you could watch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKGZZ8LHVXw&index=1&list=PLAFeKLhfSVlWPDVdWGPIe5QglqbIlpnXvTo make this conclusion short:┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌█████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌██┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌┌┌██┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌┌┌┌┌████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌████████████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌████████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌█████████┌┌███┌┌┌┌█████████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌█████┌██┌┌┌███████┌████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌██┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌█████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌████████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌┌████████████┌┌┌████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌███┌██████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌┌████┌████┌██████████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌┌┌████████████┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌██┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███████┌┌┌┌┌┌████┌┌┌┌┌┌████████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌████████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌████████████┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌█┌█┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌███┌┌┌┌┌┌█████┌┌█████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██████████████████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌██████████████┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌┌Sorry if you can't read this, L0GAN CAN'T GRADE TOO"

76561198006568104,Recommended,285310,19116864,"Posted: 16 November, 2015",all,Morgoth,"For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out mySteam profile, theYoutube channel, and theTwitch channel!!What more can be said about this game, that hasn't been said a thousand times before?  This is an incredible game that is easily worth the six dollars that it currently cost.  Even if you are not big into simulation games (like myself), this game will quickly catch your attention and it will not surrender it for quite some time.  Before you realize it, 4 hours have passed.  If anything this game is dangerous for how easily it erases massive amounts of time.I was going to write up another big, long review for this game but as I stated before, everything that could be said about how incredible this game is, has been said.  So I'll keep it short and sweet.Gameplay:Very seemingly simplistic gameplay, but with oh so much depth.  Enough to keep coming back to for days, weeks, months, years....  you get the idea.  Build a park.  Aim for the objective (# of customers, customer approval rating, etc.).  Win the game.  Play forever if you wish.  The UI that is implemented here is very user-friendly and makes building even the most ridiculous elaborate parks very simplistic.Graphics:Great graphics for the time when it was released (1999).  Runs perfectly on even the oldest of machines with no fps drops.  This game was made so incredibly stable because Chris Sawyer sat it fit to program the entire game in Assembly language.  Which is ridiculously awesome and very, VERY difficult to do, but in doing so, made the game incredibly efficient and available to a massive audience.  The game does run on every Windows OS up to Windows 10 x64 (because that's what I played it on).  Might have to mess with the resolution though.Sound:The park guests' sounds of approval, or of wretching on the sidewalk, does fit perfectly into the game, and it does give off the theme park vibe very adequately.  However, the music that can be played from the rides gets repetitive very quickly.Lasting Appeal:Holy lord don't even get me started on the lasting appeal of this game.  Not only is there the ability to play the parks forever, but in this deluxe package with the two expansions, there are over 70 FREAKING PARKS.  THAT'S value.  To give an example of how much time would be sunk into the game in that time, it would be close to 250 hours.  And that's only if you somehow manage to beat every scenario first try.  So yeah, it's got some lasting appeal.Final Verdict:This game is incredible.  It was amazing in 1999, and it's amazing in 2015.  And it will be amazing in 2025.9.5/10"

It has everything from the first game + new rides and everything.Well that's somewhat the truth, but for me it wasn't enough new things to justify a new game instead of an addon. Also unlocking new parks in the first game was a nice goal and made the replay value higher if you failed a goal of a park, because you can another one if you manage it. :)Another big problem with the second game for me is that the new rides (especially in the addons) are just reskins of existing rides, so the number of real new rides isn't that high.Well if you like a nice theme park game than stick with this one, because you still have the goal for unlocking new parks and not just a semi-sandbox game like the 2nd.Ps: Please don't ask about the weird ""World"" game. xD"

The mechanics may seem a little clunky compared to back in 1999, but that should not pushh you away from buying this game.In Rollercoaster Tycoon you need to build a theme park to complete a set of objectives set out for you at the beginning of each scenario. Some of these objectives can be completed easily while others will take quite a bit of time.  There is many different theme parks and scenarios to chose from, as this version of Rollercoaster Tycoon also includes the expansions!  Pretty good for £4.79.There are many different attractions to unlock from Merry Go Round's to Viking Ship to huge Rollercoasters; which is done through researching.  The researching mechanic is really straightforward,  the player needs to select from a bunch of preset options from ""minimum"" to ""maximum""  each option has a different cost attached to it.The game is not called Rollercoaster Tycoon for no reason!  The game enables the player to design and create their own custom rollercoaster from scratch!  Make every turn and drop of the track completely unique.  Watch that excitement rating! Players can also create rides such as log flumes, kart racing and even transport attractions such as a monorail.Of course, you need staff to run a theme park.  The player can recruit four different types of staff:  Handyman, Mechanic, Security and Entertainer.  The handyman is used to keep the staff tidy, water plants and mow the lawn,  the mechanic of course repairs any broken down rides while the security keeps those annoyances away meanwhile the entertainer is busy...well, entertaining people in many different cute and quirky costumes.The game offers quite a few customization options.  The player can set how fast a ride can go - Watch out, don't let it crash and kill your guests! Decorations such as statues, water features, plants and trees are available.  Fences, benches and trash cans are needed to keep guests happy!If you have fond memories of this game and are reading reviews to make sure it isn't just nostalgia making you interested in the purchase - I found say go for it.  This game is still solid and truly holds up.  Meanwhile, if you have not played this game and are looking for something fun and relaxing, yet potentially challenging; I would say that you owe it to yourself to play this classic game.Please note:  The steam overlay does not work in this game.  Meaning you can not press shift + tab to look at friends, guides, achievements, etc, because of this Rollercoaster Tycoon does not support screenshots.  The resolution is off too - This game can not be played on full screen on my monitor.Now, go charge your guests a $100 entrance fee and overcharge on all food, drinks and rides!EDIT: This is a fantastic game that should win the ""The Test of Time"" award in the Steam Game Awards 2016!I also wanted the badge."

76561198102352454,Recommended,285310,31663719,Posted: 10 May,all,Countersnipe,"One of the best games that you should never buy.The only issue with this game - and by issue I mean MASSIVE ISSUE - is that you cannot speed up time. The game gives you objectives to reach on each map, and in order to unlock the new maps to play you must reach the objectives of the previous maps. However, you will often find that you reach the objectives well before the deadline, but because you cannot speed up time you cannot move forward and hand in your objective to complete the map.This is kind of a really big deal because you will often find that your objective has been met, but it will be anywhere from 1-2 hours of real time before your objetive is due... I have 22 hours worth of playtime, but I think I've only spend 4 hours of time actually playing the game - I ususally just minimize the game and have it run in the background until the objective date is met.With this said - this is a fantastic game with one major major flaw. To some people, this isn't a big deal as they just play the scenario and keep building the park. but for me, I'm super objective oriented and I want to progress once I have achieved a goal... To be stuck in the map knowing I've already beaten it is super annoying."

76561198186646265,Recommended,285310,18571610,"Posted: 19 October, 2015",all,Justin Hineman,"Let me begin by saying that I have been an avid Payday fan since the first installment starting around early 2013. I played the hell out of the first game and when I heard the second was on the way around April of 2013, I couldn't have been more excited. I put in a pre-order for the Career Criminal Edition and played the beta prior to release. Once the game came out, I dumped lots of time into it. Although I'd get burnt out on it and have to take breaks for about a week or two at a time, I kept coming back to it. I was always so inspired by the devs at Overkill to do like they had, and for the past few months my friend and I have been making our own game. It's not anything much at this point but people like Simon and Almir made me passionate about games and I chose to persue that path for myself. Watching this game evolve from the beginning has been incredible, and although it's had some bad moments, we can't deny that it has had some kickass moments as well. But not anymore. Now that Overkill has made the bright decision to put microtransactions into the game, I've never been more disappointed in them. The least they could've done is ignored the questions about microtransactions, but even so, going against their word is sickening. I can no longer recommend this masterpiece product to others because they turned it into♥♥♥♥♥♥with the addition of paying more money. I mean seriously, there's already enough DLC for this game to starve your bank account, and then they decide to pull this? I don't think so. Sorry Overkill, you guys really ♥♥♥♥ing blew it this time."

Drag angry guests into a pond and watch them drown or purposely cause your rides to crash and malfunction killing tens of guests at a time and face no reprecussions at all. But lets not forget about the real life ability to over charge for your food portions by 10x or setting admission fees through the roof for your guests to enjoy the thrills of waiting in long lines for far too long.This game has all these and many more joys for you to enjoy.

,Recommended,285310,15597116,"Posted: 28 April, 2015",all,Nigel Burke,"Oh gosh, this game. It's fun. REALLY RUN.RollerCoaster Tycoon is about a game where you make rollercoasters or more specifically amusement parks who have rollercoasters in them. Your goal is to reach a certain amount of guests or park rating, among other things.The gameplay is simple. Make attractions, like rollercoasters, Go Karts, Log Flumes, etc., so your park can become more popular. You can charge people for many things, including to use the bathroom, which can be hilarious when they really need to go, but don't want to. However, doing things like that can make completing your objective harder, because people will complain about it, which will bring your park rating down. However, you can drown the unhappy people, which will bring your park rating up for some reason.However, there are some downsides. For example, on my laptop, almost EVERYTIME you close the game, my computer doesn't recognize any touches and FORCES you to shut down by using the power button. Also, the guests are WAY too scared. I made a rollercoaster that just goes down by not that much and it had an intensity meter of 11 and nobody would ride it, even though I made it free and advertised it. Also, NEVER save on the same save file. I did that and it stopped working, which was a world I spent 6 hours on.Final Verdict: 8/10+Fun+Replay Value+Years of entertainment+Addicting-Guests way too scared"

On my first day playing I was quite content with it until I made the mistake of alt. tabbing to change the song I had playing in Chrome (heck after I messed with the game a little more today I've realized that even saving the game and closing out of it triggers this). Basically any time I leave the game's screen after starting, whether to alt. tab or turn the game off the input from my mouse is messed up. Basically I can interact with some things on my screen but not others. I can change the songs in my youtube playlist, but not what tab I'm on in Google chrome, and this affects more than just that as I also could not interact effectively with task manager. Just what you can't interact with seems to fluctuate some given time off the game but still makes normal use of my machine impossible. The only semi-decent workaround I've found to this is unplugging my mouse and plugging back in, and when I went back into the game today to see if this glitch would really happen every time I closed the game out or tried to tab away even unplugging my mouse and plugging it back in didn't work at first when the glitch inevitably did occur again. Which leaves me fearful for what it could actually be doing to my machine. While I assume it isn't really hurting my machine I'm not going to continue tempting the fates with it as I don't want to have get my computer fixed.While my overal experiance in playing the game was good, this glitch has made this game the epitomy of throwing five dollars at a wall as this game has proven itself to be one that I cannot play if I value my equipment.I'll be uninstalling this and I do not recommend this game.prosSimple, easy to playhighly configurabledecently pricedconsNo tutorials or hintsIn my case a large glitch that I do not want continuing."

It's a really old game, but with the cost that it's currently at, it's well worth the price of admission. The main goal is to unlock all the maps by completing the set objectives by each individual map - obviously as time goes on, the maps get larger and larger and the potential for your park also grows.Apart from that - it's up to you! There are freeform maps where there aren't any set objectives and you can literally go wild without needing to stop. I honestly started playing this game on the original original Xbox and sadly that particular game couldn't be transferred onto the 360, but, as usual, Steam came to my rescue and the experience is miles better and the game is just as engaging as it was when it originally came out. If you get the chance to give it a go, I certainly reccomend this based on the price and the sheer addiction that forces 23 hours out of your day to day life.All good and nice, right? Well I have come across a pretty severe bug because for some reason after completing Trinity Islands last night, all my progress has been erased. Not my parks, but my progress; according to the game, I haven't completed one park, and yet according to my computer, I haven't lost a thing. I have no idea what the hell is going on, but I'm going to see if this is a permenant thing or if my computer is just being a♥♥♥♥♥♥because it's morning.In either case - buy this game for the really low price or even if it goes on offer [which is doubtful but Steam offers more packages than a postal delivery service, so it could happen]."

I absolutely love this game and remember playing it a lot as a kid (I still have the CD laying around, but I may or may not have lost it) and its sequel RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 adds to the experience in so many lovely ways~But since I played RCT1 much, much more than 2, I have to say that this is my favorite entry to the series with the second game nearly tying. RCT 3 was an interesting jump into 3D that added quite a bit and changed things up, but you can just never beat a classic~ Plus this game works on almost any computer due to its 2D nature and sprite-art, so I'm sure it'd work on a toaster if you had the right OS.Buy the game if you like management genres, but don't expect the deepest of intricacies."

,Recommended,285310,18673802,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,C3LT1C W4RCRY,"When it comes to the RTS (Real-Time Strategy) gaming genre, there are quite a few games that have left their mark. From the Command and Conquer series to Blizzard greats like Starcraft, or Warcraft, there are plenty of options when it comes to combat-style RTS games. Roller Coaster Tycoon, however, took things in a whole new direction and this is why it's in the spotlight for this BTN Gaming Review.Now Roller Coaster Tycoon, upon arrival, totally reshaped the way people look at RTS games. In fact, it really created a whole new sub-genre in the Real-Time category. While the player doesn't necessarily control every aspect of the game, they do have control over the most key features. This is just one of the many details that makes Roller Coaster Tycoon stand out from its predecessors. Another key aspect, and quite possibly the one that carried the most impact, is the simple yet detail-oriented style of play. It's a very relaxed game in the fact that there isn't an enemy on the map who is ready to pillage and plunder you for everything you've got, but that's not to say that it doesn't have its own edge. Roller Coaster Tycoon delivers its thrills in a much more intricate and subtle way. It's these exact features that make it a great game, while at the same time might give a newcomer some frustrations.For starters, Roller Coaster Tycoon's maps (campaign?) is a series of challenging theme parks that all have a certain goal that must be obtained. Whether it's building a brand new park from scratch, obtaining a specific park value, or even just to up the rating of an already thriving theme park, every single level in Roller Coaster Tycoon is wrapped around achieving these goals. Once these goals are achieved, a new map is opened up and the player can progress further on down the line. This is a great feature because it keeps the player interested with new scenes, new objectives, and really fills out the experience with the many different types of obstacles that can be overcome. However, it's this exact reason that might deter the more ""casual"" player. The reason for this is the simple fact that there is no sandbox mode. Not only is there the void of sandboxing but there is also this... nagging urge to just quit a park once the objective has been completed. If the player decides to save the current progress on any park once achieving the goal, they can return to it at any point in time.... but there really isn't much of a need to do so. This can severely cut the replay value of the game short, and while it isn't the biggest problem in the world, it can still be considered when arriving at the decision to purchase the game.While the goal-oriented gameplay of Roller Coaster Tycoon is great, jaded only by the lack of a sandbox freeplay mode, we can't forget the details. Literally, the details. Roller Coaster Tycoon is absolutely FILLED to the brim with detail-oriented time management, and it's in these details that Roller Coaster Tycoon really thrives. From being able to design the roller coaster of your dreams, down the simplest detail as simply painting every ice cream shop a different color, it's these little intricacies that drive the game. That said, it's also these very minute, albeit important, features can become daunting at certain points in the game. For instance, when it comes to building said ""Dream Roller Coaster"" the game will not allow it to be built unless all of the brakes and speedups are in the right place. Prices too high for ice cream? Well that will drive potential patrons away before you even get the chance to fix it. So with that said, it's quite easy to get lost in the details and if things start getting to difficult to understand, just remember: breathe and if all else fails, RESTART!On that note, however, there is also lack of any sort of tutorial or information that is in-game to help the player, should they feel lost. Don't get me wrong, I completely enjoy playing a game and feeling it out without any sort of help system at all. That's why I do what I do! But there are other players out there who don't want to mess around with understanding the mechanics or explore and experiment... simply put they want to achieve that goal for the next map. This is why some sort of help system within the actual framework of the game would be a huge help. For instance, your rating is dropping too low and you are just two months away from getting that coveted pat on the back for achieving an overall rating of 875 and you are sitting on 725. How do you get that rating up? Do you build more attractions? Do you lower the gate price? Do you run promotions? None of these answers are found directly in the game, not even in the help section. Thankfully though, there are pioneers out there who are willing and ready to write guides on issues such as this! That said, at least this information shouldn't be hard to find.Overall, Roller Coaster Tycoon is a great little game, especially if the player is just looking to relax and chill out with a non-stressful game. All of its features can be seen as a double-edged sword so to speak, and if you are planning on buying the game, just make sure to take these things into consideration.For more information on this game, or to buy it yourself, please visit:http://store.steampowered.com/app/285310/Be sure to check out my other content!YouTube:http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qABlog:http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/Tumblr:http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/Follow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming"

Have had this game on disc since it came out. This game is absolutely great. People I see complaining about ""no remastering, no retouching, nothing new"" can honestly go to [redacted]. This game doesn't need it. It was great back then, and it is still great now. It may be simple and it may have its issues, but that is honestly what makes it great.The parks and their objectives range from easy to challenging. What is better however is playing the parks after the objectives conclude. Some of them have so much expansion room that you can double or triple the size of the original park. Honestly, many of the parks only come into their own after the objectives have been completed because if you stay with them, what you can research and what you can build is just great.The only reason I have the steam version, plus low time, is because it was on sale and because I wanted to play them on my newer computers. Still have an old XP desktop with my original game and about 90% of the parks unlocked."

Even now as an adult I find myself completely addicted to it.I definitely think these types of games are catered to a specific type of person, though. Some people will simply look at this and think it's boring or too niche. So if you're unsure about purchasing it and already feel like you won't like it then you're probably right. As for me I love everything about it.I love organizing things. I love micro-management simulators. I love games where you start with nothing and very gradually work your way up to the top. A lot of people playRollerCoaster Tycoonbecause they think it's fun to make horrific, nightmare-esque theme parks in which people die and their ratings plummet right off the bat. I can understand the appeal of this but I honestly adore this game for exactly what it's trying to be. The better you do at running your park the more attractions you unlock. You can reshape the landscape, choose what stalls and shops will be available for your guests, hire a specific number of employees, and of course decide exactly which rides you want to include and place them exactly where you want them.Whenever I meet the goals of a level I feel a unique sense of silly pride at doing so--but pride nonetheless.I dunno.

It is a shame that they have this variety of new ride designs but it is impossible to use this feature.If you liked the original disc version when you were younger then get this, it will be quite the nostalga ride and I look forward to seeing you at the exit saying ""Rollarcoaster tycoon 1 was great!""

If you're looking for a fun and challenging campaign-based RCT, buy this one. If you want lots of mods and custom scenarios to toy with, buy 2. And last, if you want MORE mods, more realistic theme park recreations, water parks, zoo parks, and lots of sandbox coaster building, buy 3. I think all are good, but each has its strong points.But anyways, this is the original RCT, with all the expansions and a bunch of fan-made tracks added on. To put it short, it's a good game. The only major problems with this version are its quirks when used with Windows 7 and 8. The game, from what I know, will only run in a square resolution unless you change the inner workings of the EXE. It can crash fairly often, for semi-random reasons. And my install sometimes glitches my desktop when I quit, forcing me to reboot.However, if you can look past some irritating glitches on newer OSes, then this is a must-have. For about the same price as a CD of the game, you get everything on it already on your hard drive, no CD insertion required. If you're a big RCT fan, then I'd say buy it."

Some start you from scratch, others don't. Anyway, it's a simple but complicated game as most Management type games go. For instance, can't make a roller coaster too scary or hardly anyone will ride it but if it's too weak, no one will want to ride it because it's not intense enough. Just be sure to Test Run your ride first to make sure it isn't a death trap. I've accidentally killed some people because I forgot to do that first. >_> Sometimes it's really hard to know if what you're building will appeal to your guests, but once you've got it right, advertise the crap out of your new ride, and watch the dollars signs fly up.Anyway, this game is enjoyable and relaxing. If you likebuilding and maintaining and feeling powerful because you know how to maintain a park and make big bucks doing it, then this game is for you.P.S.

I bought the game at the full price of $6 because I decided I couldn't wait until it went on sale, and honestly I regret it.Immediately upon launching it for the very first time, it caused my laptop's video driver to crash. I was a little alarmed as my laptop is stronger than many gaming desktops out there, but brushed it off once a restart of my laptop got it working. Immediately I was reminded why I loved this game: it's fun and reminded me of everything that I used to love about the RollerCoaster series.Downloading and launching the game on my desktop the following day, I was pleased when there were no problems... except why can't I play it in fullscreen? Ah well, I'll deal with it, at least it didn't crash funny on me like it did on my laptop.Well then I encountered the horror story that I had read in a review - the 'save crash'. Upon saving my game after playing for two hours it crashed on me. Immediately the idea of logging back into that game and re-doing everything Ihad just donewas frustrating.But ultimately the part that really bothered me was Steams support for the game - read the supremelackof support. Going through the support site here on Steam just wanted me to contact Atari.Looking back, I feel that these were probably bugs that had been present in my original RCT, I vaguely remember problems with fullscreen mode working, and I definitely remember a video crash or too - at the time I had assumed it was my very, very outdated computer (it was classified as outdated in2000so it was definitely rather basic). The fact that these errors actually continued on to Steam was disheartening. I currently have an old scratched up CD of RCT; the reason I didn't shove that into my desktop and download it there was because I'd wrongly assumed that the one here would have these errors corrected. That was my fault.Now, I'm not saying that the game is horrible - At the time of writing this I've put 4 hours into it, and I will continue to play.

(will sometimes work after a little bit of time and some clicking - it's a bit random).- It's old (some rumours say it can be a con as well).- heard about that it doesn't work on Win 8. (I can't really say if that's true because I don't even own Win 8).OS I used/use to play the Steam version: Win7 & Win10This is a good game! I recommend it! And you can even play it on nearly any PC, unless it's a potato.But I can't say anything if it will work on any other OS's (I only got Win 7 & 10).And of course if you can't live with the con's reconsider if you really want to buy this game."

This game was made I believe late 1990's or early 2000's, with pretty good graphics and programming, made by one guy (Chris Sawyer).I remember when I first started playing this game when I was 7 years old, I had no idea what I was doing, but I had fun messing around until I went bankrupt or something. Now I know how to properly manage a park, and respond to the guests' demands, as well as making sure I make a nice and steady profit.This game still holds up really well IMO, and is nice to kill some time when you got nothing to do or anything like that. The game is also very realistic, people react to what happens in the park, not entirely, but functionally. Here's to name a few things:1. If a RollerCoaster crashes (Accidentally), some people will leave the park and the ride's popularity will plumet to 0%2. A ride's intensity and price will affect whether a guest will ride it or not (Some guests like intense rides, some don't)3. When you begin building more than 3 (Good) RollerCoasters, guests will start to no longer want to pay more than $1.00 for less thrilling rides.Just to name some things---(Also, Employees get paid less than minumum wage on this game, so be glad you don't live in a RollerCoaster Tycoon world, or you'll be living with $35-$50 a month)Overall, it's a good gameIf you like RollerCoasters, Tycoons, and CHEAP games, then give this one a try."

The ammount you can do in this game is acullty pretty good. In this game you have to work for the more prebuilt RollerCoaster tracks. The rating values of ride can vary but you can never go over the extream value thesecatogories: Exitement, Intesit, Nausea. If you go over in any of these the guests will never ride the coaster. While you can build pertty much what ever you whant in sandbox mode in other modes it can get a bit grindy waiting for money to trickel in. That is a part you have to be wary about. There are running costs of everthing, Staff wages, Reshearch, and even a working loan system. There are times were you have to get rid of a few employees or rides becuase budgeting issues. This dose not take away from the game if anything it teaches you the importance of money management, if anything the rollercoaster tycoon franciase has tought me almost everything about money management.Micro maning your park: While waiting for money and more guests show up you have to make sure you have enough staff, including some security. Security in Rollercoaster tycoon seemed a bit useless, it can be, but you'll need to fight off some vandlism. Machanics and Custodains/Janitor are a must. In alot of the park it will make sense to have a certain staff member to be programmed to take a certain area to make things a little less frustrating when guests are somplaining about dirty paths. While it's not nessary if you do not click the pointer finger or assinment tasks tabs per employee you may have a buch of Janitors tying to mow grass, wich is really not all that important. How ever i would asssing  no more than four to do just that it makes ratings go up by a slight margin. In exreme park it will make more sence to post a machanic at a certain ride becuase it beaks down too much."

Hundreds of hours of gameplay, not including replay value. Feeling of progression through scenarios that the sequel does not have. The satisfying feeling of seeing people enter and interact with an amusement park that you built. You can create your own theme park!Cons:. Selections of attractions to build feel a bit limited at times. Isometric view with no shadows makes building/landscaping a bit tedious at times. Scenario objectives mostly constrained to achieving a certain number of guests/park value. Most of the scenarios are very easy (however this doesn't take away from the fun at all) while the others are extremely difficult. Essentially, not a great difficulty curve.The pros overshadow the cons. In other words, the pros enhance the experience more than the cons take away from it.Extra note: If you've never played before, make sure you look up some strategies or gameplay footage (Zisteau being the best to watch in my opinion) before you do.

But they've not done any of that, it's just the same as the original, so any technical issues you have with the original, you're going to have with this version too. Most of the time it runs without any issues, but remember that this game was originally written for Windows 95.If you already own the original game, this is not really worth it as you're not paying for an overhauled version like you may be hoping. You're literally just getting ripped off by paying up for the exact same thing again. It feels a bit like they've just gotten a cracked version of the game and stuck it up on here for sale.Also, this is the US version of the game, so it uses the US park and ride names. It doesn't support all the same languages that the UK/EU version did. Swedish is missing, for example.With that said, this is one of my favourite childhood games and is still an excellent games that will serve you with countless hours of enjoyment.

There are some great custom roller coasters and they are larger then the screen so placing them without the ability to zoom out gets to be a guessing game.  I also sometimes find myself deleting objects next to the ones I'm trying to delete due to the lack of ability to zoom in.A couple of things to note.1) To save the game you need to type something and hit enter as (at least on my screen) the part where it's prompting you to enter the save file name is not visible.2) After you close the game you need to right click or your left click functionality won't work correctly.

My only issues so far are that the A.I (to be expected) sometimes is a little wonky as one time one of my rides was not working for like a long time and the engineers wouldn't fix it even when I told them to and turned off inspect rides. So far so good so I give this game a very positive review. One last thing before this is done for some reason sometimes my game's colors just die out for some reason not sure if it's just my laptop (as I'm typing this review it is happening) but other than that fantastic game that I would reccomend to people who are new to this type of game as in my opinion it is easy to pick up and addictive to play.
,Recommended,285310,28886104,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,FlowingMindspin,"Man, what a deal this is -- I paid $50 or so for this when it was new over a decade ago, and then bought the expansions separately after that. Fast forward to now and while I can find the discs, they're scratched up and my computer won't read them properly half the time. I got this for $2.49 on sale and it is very much worth that price. Hell, I'd say it's worth ten times that when you look at the amount of scenarios and content this game has.For the uninitiated, you build a theme park... sometimes from scratch, sometimes adding on to an existing park. Some scenarios require you to have a certain amount of guests, a certain park rating, or increase the value of the park by a certain amount before a year or more has passed in the game. There are dozens of attractions, coasters, rides, and shops to place into your park and quite a few besides just the roller coasters allow you to construct a ride of your own design (other ""build your own"" rides include a boat hire, train, monorail, car ride, log flume, and water slides), and there are a dozen or so types of coasters on top of that.Building and running a successful park is a balancing act of proper pricing, layout, marketing, and well-designed custom rides. You can't just make a coaster with a 90 foot drop that sends your patrons through all kinds of madness at 80 mph -- they won't get on it because it's too scary. A successful coaster has lots of different elements (hills, banked turns, helixes, tunnels, loops, and what have you), goes through those elements at the proper speed, and has scenery and theming that add to the ride's excitement (like rushing through a row of trees after a big drop, or a loop that has a track going through it).I feel like I could talk about this game forever... in short, if you like building things, buy this game. If you like theme park sims, buy this game. If you are put off by the dated graphics (which still look pretty darn good to me), buy this game anyway and be surprised at the depth and amount of content there is.I can't recommend this game enough."

Each park that your entrusted to improve has their own challenges like trying to fit more rides in a space thats a 16th of someother maps.

Hey, it must be an effective name because it certainly got this guy a better job than doing tricks off the curb for fifty cents a blow. This day was mainly dedicated to orientation, some quick training on how to handle kids with problems, and also refreshing my skills in CPR. Here I come, world!Day 2: When I first saw the manager, I was expecting a fat slob with cheeto dust cascading down his chin like an avalanche. Instead, it was a skinny guy who looked weirdly like Mr. Burns. He didn't literally look like him, of course, but there was this aura to him. His eyes met mine and I suddenly had a feeling of pure dread. I'm sure it must've been remembering this one guy who grabbed the back of my head and... well... I'm certainly glad that last job is behind me.The manager walked up to me and pointed to an elevated scaffolding sitting in the middle of the lake. ""You're assigned there,"" he spoke with a silky, caramel-like voice.""But how will I reach the kids?"" I asked. I suddenly felt myself being lifted by the neck of my mascot costume! I managed to twist the head around to get a look, and it was THIS DISEMBODIED FLOATING CLAW RIGHT OUT FROM AN ARCADE MACHINE! It took me higher and higher, farther and farther away, until it finally dropped me directly onto this tiny platform sitting in the middle of a huge lake.At least it wasn't tuggies and blowies, I said to myself.Day 21: I'm still up here. I wake up, and I see strange things happening throughout the park. An entire corner is nothing but Go-kart tracks. All of them named ""MONEY SINK"". Children flock to the short lines, over and over and over again. The children spend hours and hundreds of dollars, at any of the Money Sinks. What the hell is happening with this park? There's not even a roller coaster yet! The only other rides I can see from up here are a merry-go-round, a ferris wheel, and countless concession stands!One of the twenty handimen are lifted here daily by that disembodied crane, and he brings me food and water. I ask him when I can go down and see the kids. However, every day it is a different handiman, and I could've sworn the latest one was wearing a plastic mask.At least it isn't tuggies and blowies...Day 59: the Money Sinks have multiplied, as have the crowds. Countless children from all around the country are getting ripped off from these rip-off go-kart rides. They don't even last a second! They make one loop and screech to a halt! Why is that manager building these things?At least it isn't tuggies and blowies... at least it isn't tuggies and blowies.Day 123: I know why the manager built the money sinks. I wake up today, and I see three enormous go-kart tracks. Each of them unique in design, twisting and turning, with tunnels through the earth, and bridges over the waters. From this platform, I can see the splendour in the craftsmanship. I can see that the tracks are simply experiences no human should life without.I look at the line-ups, and they're entirely empty. I am puzzled as to why. They are magnificent! They are far superior to tuggies and blowies!Day 124: The manager flies up to the platform via the disembodied claw. He tells me I'm fired, because I haven't been entertaining the children..........""Can I ride on one of those go-kart tracks?"" I ask.""No,"" he replied, ""This isn't Roller Coaster Tycoon 3."""

I've played it since I was a young kid so the difficulty bar is low on the border of not existing.Two heads up though:1. There is an option in the main menu to start a tutorial game. Not sure if that ever worked, but it sure did not work for me today.2. When I tabb out or exit the game, my mouse does not work.

If you've ever played RTC on any platform, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find this as an unabridged version of that game. With that being said, I find this to be one of the most essential and iconic video games ever created. Chris Sawyer delivered upon us a true masterpiece with this endlessly replayable tycoon game. In my entire life, I've probably logged over 1,000 hours into this game. Graphically, a small minority of first time players may call this ""dated"" or ""old.' That small minority of players would instantly be shut down by anyone, as even though this game was released in the 90's, one could definitely still see that these visuals have stood the test of time. The replay value on this is literally endless. Once you complete every scenario in the game (which is an achievement in its' own right), you can create your own scenarios! You can also create a hyper realistic park, or even a death trap park to sadistically kill your guests & employees, if you're so inclined.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be up at 2:37 AM perfecting the scenery around your custom roller coaster to get even a slightly higher excitement rating on your ride. If I could reccomend only one game to someone, on a budget or otherwise, it would definitely be this one. For $5.99, you simply cannot get any more replay value out of any game ever, hands down. This is a true classic. If video games are to be considered art, then this game would be on display at the virtual Louvre.10/10"
