76561198019205444,Recommended,285330,14762686,"Posted: 6 March, 2015",all,sitebender,"Welcome back to Roller Coaster Tycoon. If you remember anything about the first game, then you'll know everything about this version. Right off the bat, the only big difference is larger parks to put your fiendish death coasters into. Other than that, there are minor difference here and there such as now your patrons will take photos of cool stuff like coasters. They can now seek out a first aide station if they feel very sick and if they run out of cash, there's always an automatic teller machine! You'll also find a coaster designer out of game. Other than that, the difficulty seems to have gotten ramped up from the previous game. There are no easy victories here, but its not about the victory, since all 58 scenarios are unlocked from the start. Because this is Triple Thrill Pack, its not just RCT2, but its got all three expansion packs in one dirt cheap price.For anyone that doesn't know, Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 and 2 are theme park management games that let you build roller coasters and plop down attractions in an isometric view. What really makes RCT stand out more than any other management game is the fact that you indeed design your own roller coasters! Its fun and easy, first select the type of attraction, then put down a platform and you can make it as long or short as you want. Then in most cases make a lift hill, then some turns, drops, ups and downs, spirals, loops, a helix, a cobra roll and so on. Every type of coaster has different trains, tracks, and specifics.After you're done with your coaster, make an entrance and an exit. Don't forget a line cue to your entrance. This is for everyone waiting in line. A long line cue means boredom sets in and you might need to hire a mascot to entertain them as they wait. Having beautiful decorations also helps keep people entertained. There are many different themes to enable. Even more with the three expansion packs! Perhaps too many, but having so much lets you create something you want.Rides get broken down into three ratings. Excitement, intensity and nausea. To boost excitement, add more decorations, set it next to another ride if not through another ride. Every visitor has their own preference. some can tolerate high nausea, others want low intensity and so on. The tighter the turns, the higher the nausea rating. When someone comes out of your ride they can be sick. So from there have benches waiting for them to rest and regain their composure otherwise they'll heave on the ground and then you'll need handymen tot clean it up.You can hire an array of staff, handymen, mechanics, entertainers and security. Then assign them each to have a patrol. Its a nice system to cover a lot of ground. Handymen and other staff have check boxes to determine what you want them to do, stuff like water gardens, clear out trash and mow lawns. Its all your choice.If you don't want to build coasters, there are pre-built designs that you can plop down, but you can reap the benefits by making your own custom coaster. You can make it dip down into the ground for a tunnel, hang over water and contour it to the hills and valleys of your land to save money.There's even a new feature in RCT2 that will let you design your own coaster without needing to build it right there on the fly in a theme park. This is a money saving feature, because building one in your theme park still costs you money and you might run out. The only problem with using the design editor is that if you need to use the tool, you'll need to save your game, drop out of it, go back into the menu, select the design tool, open it up, make a coaster, save it, get out of the editor, jump back into your save game and then plop down your custom coaster as a pre-built. Some people just want to design coasters, they don't want all the frills of managing an entire park and the coaster designer lets  you do that. RCT2 cares about those people.I mentioned the 58 scenarios, each one puts you into a pre-existing area, such as a castle, an airfield, and yes even the moon itself. It definitely adds a lot of flair and character that the original game lacked without expansion packs. While these environments are big, detailed and beautiful on their own, I feel like its too much to just start out in. You've got dozens of paths going everywhere when all you need to start is a quarter of a gigantic park. So then to keep from having your visitors walk all over the place, you'll put down barricades over your paths that don't let them cross.Each one of these scenarios has different conditions to win. Everything from get X amount of dollars in Y amount of years to having X amount of patrons in your park by year Y. There's a lot of variety and between the conditions and the environments, it keeps the game interesting and fresh from park to park. It gives me a reason to keep playing, because one year in the game is an hour in real life. These scenarios often last 3+ years, making for what could be a 175 hour game and that's assuming you stop playing a scenario when you complete it! You can keep going on and on to your heart's content.The longer you go, the more your rides will break down. A new ride draws more people while an old ride, just feels stale and familiar. That's why you can save the ride, bulldoze it for some money and rebuild it again at full price! Its not just fictional parks in Africa or medieval times, there's a section of real life parks from the late 90s. Six real life parks including Magic Mountain and others owned by Six Flags.Outside of roller coasters, log rides and anything else with a track, there are lesser rides that you can just plop down and make an entrance and an exit to. You can customize the entrances with themes and customize the paths, ground height, water, plants and so on. It all costs a price of course, but you can make exactly what you want to. Speaking of that, if you want to turn your roller coasters into death traps go for it! Its one of the fun things about the game. Make a power launch roller coaster shoot people off the rails sending them to their demise! Don't expect anyone to ever ride the coaster ever again, even after you fix it! Cowards.Your guests will need to eat, drink and go to the bathroom, so don't forget to place vendors in strategic locations. They'll need places to sit and garbage cans too. There is a wide array of shops too, sunglasses, T-shirts, caps and balloons to sell. Place them where people are happiest and they'll spend for sure.You'll get to manage the park's finances, but you won't get lost or overwhelmed. Its all pretty easy. You can quickly take out a cheap loan from the bank if you need money. You can spend money on advertising for the park, specific rides or other such things and they have a great impact on your visitors. To unlock new attractions, you'll need to put money into research. The more money per month, the quicker rides will be enabled in the scenario.With everything said, RCT2 like its predecessor is a relaxing time sink that you can enjoy for decades like I did. I was still playing RCT2 on CD-ROM before it came to Steam! There's something here for management fans, coaster buffs and creation enthusiasts. While I feel like the vanilla version of RCT2 didn't have that many parks for the original price tag, the three included expansion packs make it a much better game."

It has a place in my heart no other game can fill, and it will always be the first computer game I ever had that gave me something to show off to friends with.You see, if you got this game from a cereal box (like most of us did), you are part of the best generation to experience PC gaming.Or, who knows. Maybe you played the crap out of text-based adventures back in the day and just happened to love sugary cereal at the tender age of adulthood.It truly was a good time to get into the idea of gaming on your computer. Not because legendary, classic titles came in cereal boxes, but because everyone of the ""common genres"" of game weren't set in stone yet and plenty of new companies were making PC games that were always probing an aspect of the video game that hasn't been looked into before. Nowadays the market of new games can be separated into ""niche indie titles"", ""AAA games with PC ports"" and the rare ""well-rounded good game"". Back then... you had the Tycoon series.Ladies and gentlemen, the Tycoon series of games was probably what saved me from adolescent boredom and actually gave me something fun to do on Windows 98.Bored after school? Boot up ""Extreme Heights"" and build another coaster that manages to do 10 loops in a row.You could basically build whatever park you wanted and force dumb, oblivious NPCs to eat up whatever crap you make. The system was intricate. It was always giving you feedback for how reasonable your setup is, as well as fine-tuning over even the most menial tasks.The slow nature of the game gave the players a lot of choice and challenge. Do you spend all of your money at once for something that can either make or break the park, or build a bunch of safe, small rides that will only gradually build me money?It feels a little weird writing this review because of the fact that I never really stopped with RollerCoaster Tycoon games. It's a game I will always respect and my one hope is that it is never lost and forgotten.The nostalgia value in this game is equivalent to Sock 'Em Boppers and Lincoln Logs."

Whether it be get so many people to your park, have a high park rating by year 3, etc. You can achieve this by creating rides, adding decorations, hiring staff members to keep the park in shape, adding food stands, the list goes on and on.While Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 was the original, this game feels like it takes it one step further. Cleaning up the UI, adding new decorations, fixing some AI and adding completely new rides. Now you may be thinking, ""why by this version when I can buy RCT3 which is in 3d?"" Thats where I think they went wrong by making the game 3d. It doesnt have the charm that this game has.I did have a problem where the game was crashing on me whenever I saved or loaded game. I managed to fix it by running the game in Windows XP (SP2) and admin. I'm running Win. 8.1, so this fix might not work for all of you.All in all I recommend this game to people who like casual games, sim games, fun games (not really a category but the game is fun), heck even a hardcore gamer might like this (Im a hardcore gamer so hopefully you share this opinion) For a great value of $10 you can have hours, upon hours of entertainment, which includes everything RCT2 has to offer!

Even now, with the graphics definitely looking tired, it will bring you hours of very simple fun, build a ride and see how much you can charge before guests say its enough. Or starve them, then build one burger bar, put a very steep price and watch money flooding in. Or even better, build a coaster that will eventually crash, then comfort all the mourners with free black balloons...and free rides on the coaster that just has crashed! Yes, this game was always my favourite, a safe haven where I could unleash all my sadistic fantasies! And after all these years, nothing has changed, I still love to see the message 'Robert D. has just drowned'."

To make it work, download OpenRCT2 from here:https://openrct2.orgOpenRCT2 lets you play the game on windows 10, and it's where most of my hours have gone. Yep, RCT2 is just that good.Roller Coaster Tycoon in general is an awesome franchise which allows you to create your own theme parks, filling them with rides, stalls, staff, and of course, roller coasters.The main storyline in RCT2 is that you pick a premade park which has certain objectives for you to fill. Some ask for a park rating of a certain number, having a certain number of people in your park, or reaching a high park value. In order to accomplish any of these things, of course, you build roller coasters.The game is a great ball of fun, watching the peeps walk around your park, tasting food and riding your rides,dying in your grand death-parkand overall enjoying themselves.RCT2 is one of my favourite editions in the series, just a bit above the third. With the right programs it'll run amazingly well on even the highest piece of tech and is just a great game overall."

Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 were my go to games before I joined Steam.Maybe it’s the simplicity of the title, or the enjoyment of charging people to go to the bathroom. Whatever the case might be, if you have an older system you are likely to enjoy this title.If you happened to give into Microsoft marketing and upgraded to 8/8.1/10, you should seek OpenRCT2 in addition. RC2 is a game built in assembly (really, just look at the system requirements) it will almost be required for you to use OpenRCT2 to play this title.The game plays out of the box on Windows 7, but beware that it uses a lower color depth, and alt+tab users should not be alarmed by the change in color modes.Resolutions are also minimally supported, the max usable for 16:9 users being 720. Obviously, you aren’t playing this game for the “leading” graphics.All the other later games in the series personally don’t seem to add anything meaningful, so I’d advise you to just grab RC2 and leave it at that."

,Recommended,285330,11173455,"Posted: 10 July, 2014",all,Pirate Santa,"When I was looking for a flash drive in my desk, I happened upon a disk that I had nearly forgotten about. My old copy of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 had survived through 3 different operating systems, 4 computers and much more, but I hadn’t used it since 2010. I popped it in my computer and started to install, but to my dismay the years had caught up with it and the installation had failed.It then occurred to me that Steam may have a copy, and indeed it does. I haven’t played this game for so long, but starting it up to hear the old theme brought me back immediately. While I do assume that most buyers here on steam are gamers looking for nostalgia, I would like to talk about the game for possible newcomers as well.While RCT 2 may not be too big of a change compared to the original, there is no doubt that there is much more for you to do. More rides, stalls, park options and more are available, along with plenty of rides inspired by Six Flag rides. Customization within the game can feel endless, building everything from log plumes to corkscrew rollercoasters, but you can always just take pre-built rides if you’re in a rush as well. While customization is the main idea of RCT 2, management is also important. If you want to build more, you’re going to need more mechanics to keep your rides running. If your rides are intense people will puke and that will mean more handymen. You have to juggle expenses with customer happiness to make sure you don’t go out of business, and make sure you hit the park’s goal in time too.This is not to say that the game is perfect—there are plenty of little glitches that are infuriating at times. There are two types of parks: those you pay to enter, and those that are free but are charged for individual rides. When playing a pay-to-enter, you set your admission. When your park has a lot of great rides you can charge more, but that doesn’t mean your guests know that. I’ve built huge, sprawling parks and charged admission at $80+, still winning “best value park” awards, but people only carrying $20, $40 or $68 may still come up to my gates, only to be denied entry. This means that all these potential guests (and revenue) just doesn’t come into my park.Along with this are little other bugs. Wide-screen is all but impossible without modification to the game, and guests can complain about “over-crowding” when there are too many people on one path, even get stuck on paths if there are too many people on it, creating an endless loop. The simple solution would be to have a double-wide path, but the AI continues on, ignoring the extra space and complaining the entire time. In the end this won’t do too much to hurt your score, but the fact remains that if you look at your guests aggregate thoughts, be prepared for things you can’t fix.Bugs aside, I still see RCT2 is a masterpiece. As I work now to perfect every park, it seems hard to believe this game is almost 12 years old. You can see it in its graphics and mechanics, but it still has plenty of charm. If you love Tycoon games, I definitely recommend this one. Between customization, management and plenty of other options, this game still has plenty of charm, for newcomers and veterans alike."

This series, and most especially this particular installment, were most of what my free time was spent on during my childhood. I sunk hours and hours into this game. I'm still completely in love with it. So I was pretty upset when every single time I began a park, the game would crash. I couldn't even begin construction on rides before I'd get a crash. If I looked away for a minute or two, I'd look back and find the game stopped working. This process was repeated about 5x and I was ready to wash my hands of the game until I read through some forums and discovered OpenRCT2. I was skeptical, I'm on a new computer and very paranoid about downloading outside programs. But I have been having nothing but success now. The game works, doesn't crash, and has some cool features. If you're going to get this game, OpenRCT2 is almost a must and very much worth it."

The ATM and boatload of scenery is especially a nice touch-I've read it's considered the ""best"" Rollercoaster Tycoon, meaning there's likely a healthy supply of fanmade content for the gameCONS:-20 second long crowd noise loop still irritating as hell. ""ROLLER COASTER"" ""BUT WHYYYYY"" ""EHAHAHAHAHA. BWAAAHH. OOOHOOOOHOOOHOOO."" It was cute for nostalgic reasons for about 2 minutes before I wished they made a longer, more varied sound for crowded areas-It's pretty much the same as the first game except with more stuff, meaning they didn't seem to add that much-The scenarios suck my toes. Almost all of the ones I've tried so far make you wonder if they even put any thought into making them. Half the time the existing rides don't even have names. The scenery looks good (or, at least, it probably did back in the day, so I'm trying to judge it on that) but most of the time it just gets in the way. Sometimes guests get lost on thepre-existing paths. You rarely allowed to charge per ride so you're stuck entirely relying on vendors and admission fees. Give me Forest Frontiers or Dynamite Dunes over Alcatraz and Rio anyday-Maybe I haven't figured it out yet but it seems like there's no way to access the Steam community inside the game, which makes playing while you're chatting with someone a pain in the neck.Overall, despite my criticisms, it's cheap and fun and it's in no way worse than the original (aside from the scenarios).

I had never played a tycoon game before this, and this game makes me wonder why.  It is extremely fun.  Before I knew it, I had played 7 hours in one sitting on one park that I built from scratch with a small loan of $10,000.Despite having been launched in 2002, this game feels like it only came out a few years ago with the amount of options you get.  This is absolutely worth the $2.49 I spent on it.I had also picked up Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 but refunded it because this just drew me in, and has more modding support by way of OpenRCT2, which enhances the game with pickable resolutions, online multiplayer, and lots of small QoL modifications.My biggest complaint, though, is that you can't use the Steam Overlay in this game, apparently due to the coding language the game was made in.  But I do not think that is the fault of the devs or Steam, but rather it is the fault of the age of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2."

Unfortunately, like many new games it lacks proper support for windows 10. What you are buying is a broken and unstable game. After messing with the compatability settings you will get it to run however at the cost of being plaigued with game crashes and glitches. I had a wonderful park started and then the game glitched causing me to no longer have the ability to unlock new rides and food stands. When the game does unlock things for you it seems to be in a way that doesnt make sense both in the amount of time taken, as well as which rides you unlock. Long story short is that unless you are running this game on an old OS you probably should avoid it. But if you have old operating systems you will be enjoying the game immensely. Do I reccomend this game? No, most people have windows 8 or 10 at this point and I dont know that it will run much better on 7. If you have xp I highly recommend it!"

First of all, I had to activate a setting hidden deep inside of my computer just to even turn this game on. Secondly, even after being able to turn it on, there's no settings for screen scrolling sensitivity or windowed mode. I shouldn't have to download a third party software for that. Finally, every time I close this game, I have to restart my entire computer because the screen locks up the screen so I can't click anything else. Amazing how Microsoft and Valve works right? You can have the most realistic and graphics expanding capabilities in games like Skyrim or Assassin's Creed, but don't even think about trying to play a game released in 2002."

I HIGHLY DO NOT suggest downloading this game from them, but to try a different online company.This absolutely ridiculous, I was told this was a good company to buy a game off and then this happens and I was refused a refund due to this.After playing this game for about an hour it started freezing and skipping. I thought it would stop so I continued to play but it has now turned into consistent freezing for long periods of time, game crashing, and I've had to fully reboot my computer three times due to this. It's not even letting me exit the game I had to reboot my computer to stop it after it was frozen for over an hour and would not let me quit the game. I then sent a request for a refund  and to inform Steam of the problem and was told due to the 7 hour play time I was refused. However this game was frozen for over an hour at a time, multiple times. I never got to experience this game due to the freezing. And I was still denied a refund after all that."

However, there does not appear to have been any updates/fixes before releasing this on steam.  I'm not expecting new graphics or content, but i'm expecting it to be playable without having to download 3rd party hacks.  In my experience, it has been a very buggy game since purchasing on steam, others may have better luck, take note of the fact that windows 7/8 are both not officially supported in the system requirements.Graphics issues abound, don't even think about ever using alt-tab while playing this game, it may still be playable, but frequently the colors will change to what seems like an 8-bit pallette? it is not a good look.  The game frequently takes several tries to start, the music almost always works, but the graphics frequently do not (black screen w/music).  There are numerous workarounds and third party hacks/launchers that help to minimize these issues, but it is a lot of extra work, and none of them quite 'fix' it.  Make sure to save often, the game has quit on me numerous times, frequently the cursor will stop working altogether, or you'll find yourself clicking on one area, but the game recognizing it as you clicking on another area, very frustrating.For the times when you do get to play the game, however, it's glorious."

Just hearing that music gave me chills down my back and draw a smile upon my face as if I were a 10 years old version of me playing it for the first time again.- For those who played any RCT before:So... RCT2, what´s to say about it? In a nutshell it´s basically RCT1 with more attractions, bigger parks, some minor tweaks here and there and more customization for you to play around like choosing the music for the rides.- For those who never played any RCT before:This is a game so simple that is perfect, yes it´s a 2D with ISO camera game but don´t let that get in your way of playing this as that same two things are the ones that will let you play this game in ANY computer from a pentium 4 to an i7 beast. If you like the tycoon genre or simulation games this is just for you as it puts you in the shoes of the one in charge of making and managing a theme park, you will find yourself placing your first ride and choosing the location, price, colour, music, decoration and the themes for it, then you place an information kiosk or a souvenir stall and you find that it lets you even choose the colour of the umbrella or t-shirt you are selling, once you are done with that you realize that you need a handyman and a mechanic to keep the park up and running so you open the staff window just to see that you can choose the staff colour and uniform! (in the case of the entertainer). What is my point with all this? To let you know that you shouldn´t turn this game down for the fact that is a 2D old game, HECK NO! This game enables you to make any park you want, your imagination is the limit!To sum up, this game is easily my favourite of all time, it´s incredible that being that old it still holds up agains time and keeps making me spend hours and hours on it like the first time I played it. This is for those who knows that a good game is based on good game mechanics instead of pretty graphics (so I wouldn´t recommend a 12 years old buying it as the first thing he is gonna say it´s ""this game is awful, look at those graphics!""), so if you played RCT1 and you liked it BUY THIS, if you like drowning the people who hate your park BUY IT (yes, you can do that), if you like making crazy roller coasters that crashes into a mountain BUY IT (you can also do that), if you don´t mind the 2D graphics and ISO camera BUY IT, this game is a no brainer and you will spend tons of hours on it without even realizing it, trust me.10/10"

It's not something you think would be fun to play, but it is. You get to completely customize how your rides are built, you decide where people can walk, whether your guests live or drown in the nearest pool of water, you can even create a park designed to make your guests suffer an untimely demise. All that with the ability to create your own parks with their own objectives, there's plenty to keep you entertained.The game isn't perfect though, removing unneeded footpaths can be slightly annoying due to the isometric camera angle and somewhat picky programming, but it's nothing that makes the game even slightly less fun.If you haven't experienced this game yet, pick it up, you'll surely enjoy yourself.

Bear in mind, this game is more than a decade old now and running on an engine even older than that. I've been playing RCT since 1999, and I've been playing RCT2 since its come out. I literally have logged thousands of hours on this title, and its one of the few games I binge play.RCT2 brings a huge collection of roller coasters, rides, shops, and scenery items to the table. If this isn't enough, RCT2 will also support custom flat rides and scenery items; although the online community has flatlined over the years (there are still some good sites to pull content from). You can even skip the whole career/story mode and jump right into a sandbox!One of the reasons this game has survived for so long is because its extremely easy to play and it masterfully blends several things you like in a game... sandbox, simulation, and design. RCT2 is about as user friendly as it gets, with the learning curve set to child. You are literally limited by your own creativity. This is by far one of the most fluid, relaxing, and satisfying game to play.If only Atari would collaborate with Colossal Order, then we could have a game with the impeccable game design of RCT2 and the realism of Cities: Skylines. THAT would be the perfect way to revisit this dusty, old franchise and that would be a MONSTER hit since this whole genre of gaming pretty much ends at RCT2."

Even if you don't love theme parks, there is fun to be had in every nook and crany of this game, from the pre set scenarios to the scenario editor to the coaster creator.Of course, I have to mention the awesome software of and commuity at OpenRCT2. The mod enhances the game, introduces multiplayer, and lets this gem run on any PC and OS. Even a toaster could handle this.Prepare to never be able to forget the same 2 scream tracks, and build that music-making merry-go-round right at the entrace, you won't regret it.9.5/10The ""ride must be a continuous circuit"" message should die with Jenny S. when it falls off the screen.

,Recommended,285330,25014525,"Posted: 19 August, 2016",all,LiquidX,"This was one of my childhood favorites. I remember when I had my old PC and had this and all of the expansion packs on it. It was just so much fun!FEATURES:- You can create roller coasters (duh).- You can hire staff to entertain your visitors/clean up your park/fix your rides.- You can rename individal people and staff to deliver torture to your worst enemy!- You can build at such places as Alcatraz Prison and the Great Wall of China!- You can also create food stands, souvenier shops, etc.- You can be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and charge people to use the only toilet in your park.There are some downsides to this game however. For example:- It will crash every now and again, but that's just because the game is old.- The isometric view may screw you up a bit when it comes to building your coasters.- Other bugs that I may have forgotten to mention.This game for me only got better when I discovered OpenRCT2, a mod that enhances the game. BIG time.Here's the link:https://openrct2.org/I definitely reccommend getting OpenRCT2 if you truly want to expand your experience with this game.OpenRCT2 Features:- Can make rides go faster than 500 mph! (Caution: this may crash the game if used excessively in one park)- Can change the carts of every ride to something else (I.E: Replacing the regular roller coaster carts with a tram)- Fixes (most) bugs from the original game.- Adds in cheats so you can manipulate your customers/park to your very whim!- Adds in MULTIPLAYER!! That's right, MULTIPLAYER!! (I haven't tried it for myself yet, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that is impressive to convert a game like this into a multiplayer experience)- Fixes (most) crashes, unless you cause the crashes yourself.Do I reccommend this game by itself? Yes.Do I reccommend this game with OpenRCT2? The definitive choice.10/10 for me.As a bonus, here's some tips for both the standalone game and OpenRCT2 (based on the ""Build Your Own Six Flags Park"" Scenario):- Start slow. Don't go right into building coasters. Build food stands and simple rides (Ghost House, for example) until you have enough people in your park. Otherwise, you will have blown all of your money and spent at least $20,000 of your $100,000 loan.- Go easy on the inversions for most rides. You can have a big coaster with a lot of inversions, but don't do it for every ride. Not only does it become confusing after a while, but your guests won't like it.- (OPENRCT2 ONLY) You can go fast, but don't go TOO fast. 200 mph should be fine, but don't do a 50 lap coaster going at 500 mph. This will probably crash the game.- (OPENRCT2 ONLY) Turn on the cheat ""Unlock all prices"". That way, if you feel you're struggling with finances, you can charge people to go on your coasters. You'll thank me later.- (OPENRCT2 ONLY) In multiplayer, don't be that guy that destroys one's park for the hell of it. If you want to get the most fun out of multiplayer, cooperate and come up with unique ideas for rides together.The reason why it says I only have roughly 1.3 hours is because playing OpenRCT2 doesn't show that you're playing RCT2 on Steam. OpenRCT2 is its own executable file that relies on the RCT2 binaries/files.Also, be sure to name your 3D Cinemas ""The Legend of Harambe"" and set the theme to ""Storm Chasers"". You'll thank me later."

Easy to figure out, yet extremely difficult to master, this game still challenges me every time I play!I was actually very sad to see the isometric graphics go when the series progressed to version three.  I much prefer this style to that 3D look, which looks like garbage to me, not to mention how cartoony it is.  No, RCT2 is much more refined.I guess my only qualm when it comes to RCT2 is that there is no progression of parks, it is just open the game and play whatever park you want.  It does lose some of the challenging aspect, trying to unlock every park possible."

,Recommended,285330,32729662,Posted: 24 June,all,SugarBomb,"This game is fun, if you enjoy the isometric strategy games as much as I do, but be warned; there's more to it that what you think, both positively and negatively. I highly suggest it, however, to anyone new in the Amusement park tycoon genre, as I think it'll appeal more to you guys.Let's start off with the cons. Really, I only found one because the game doesn't lag, has lasting gameplay, and other things. However, be warned; all of this doesn't matter if you don't download open RCT2. The game will crash on you, deleting all of yuor data you didn't save, and it does this frequently. I don't know if this is fixed, but I'd rather not try to find out. One other thing that may make you choose the original over this one; the scenarios in this are actually pre-built, and they have some attractions, and clear areas to put roller coasters or rides. That's about it. This game will not dissapoint you if you're into this sort of thing.Alright, time for the pros.I would have to start off with the lasting gameplay. Different rides and different coasters are unlocked through reasearch, so you'll have to spend some time not only collecting money to build rides, but spending money to research them. This is a neat little mechanic I appreciate because it makes the game last longer without an obvious barrier, since it allows you to allocate your funds in research.Another detail I noticed is how different scenarios have different coasters. You can make different scenarios in this game, albeit with a limited pallete. What does this mean? Well, it means you can't choose every single roller coaster and attraction along with every single scenery. This has it's ups and downs. On the one hand, it makes the gameplay sweeter knowing that you can't experience everything in one playthrough. On the other, though, you'll feel limited when it comes to options if you want to have everything from the start. I think you should be able to choose, but it's mainly due to sprite limitations.Last thing I would have to say is that it delivers. Yes, the graphics are pretty bad, and yes, the rotation does take some getting used to, but for a 10$ game, it's pretty solid in content. As I write this, it is 3.50; definetly worth it. If you aren't going to play it now, buy it for later.There is one final thing I have to put forward, that goes along with my previous statement; it's old. This game, even if you will enjoy it, does have it's limitations. If you want a low-budget tycoon game, then this is the game for you. It does everything it says it does for 10$ and more. If you're looking for a better rollercoaster tycoon game, though, you'll have to go planet coaster. Planet coaster does everything mention above without crashing, with better controls, more availability, and the fact the camera is 3d makes it better for everyone and more modern. The graphics are great, but for all of that, you'll have to pay over a couple of more bucks. So while RCT2 game has more content, it has less overall than Planet Coaster.Well, that's all I had to say. If you are new, definetly get this game. If you are looking for a game to play meanwhile, get the game. In fact, there is barely any reason *not* to get the game. Just don't forget to download OpenRCT2 for the crashed :)"

I'd say it plays just as well as I remember, but I've been playing it every since the day the first game was released. It takes everything the first game had, polishes every aspect of it, and throws a ton of new content in that never gets old. The unique visual style has barely aged a day, and the music will burrow its way right back into your brain. And that's just the base game.Possibly the best reason for buying this game digitally was the advent of OpenRCT2, a massive project that overhauls the game from the ground up, reworking it from assembly code to an increasingly easy to modify open-source software. It's created a limitless world for game modifications, from new maps and scenarios, new scenery, new ride and vehicle types, and tons of UI and technical improvements. There are even lovingly recreated versions of the scenarios from the first game - essentially giving you 1 and 2 for the price of just this game. Most importantly. the game can now run at 60 FPS at a 4k resolution; even 1080 was impossible for the base game, making playing on any setup incredibly simple. It even removes all compatibility issues with newer operation systems.RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is a game that can only stand to get better and better with age."

Something I liked about the original and many of the custom scenarios is that they mostly felt like places you actually might build a theme park, like around a giant lake. With a couple exceptions the RCT2 scenarios mostly go for weirdness, like building a park on mars, or for stuff that doesn't feel quite realistic, like building a park around the great wall of china. I know that's quite a dumb complaint, and it obviously doesn't mean you shouldn't get the game, but I never could get into building a park that really felt quite right around the grand canyon. Since there are so many great ones available it doesn't really matter.However RCT2 is an excellently designed sequel in that in almost all ways it is a direct upgrade over the previous game (and it's much better than its successor RCT3 in a lot of ways too.) There are more rides, better decorations, among lots of other improvements. This game is a classic through and through and at the heart of things its just really fun to make an amusement park, and you really owe it to yourself to try it if you haven't already."

It's not the GAME'S fault whatsoever, it's the problem with newer OS's.Now that that's out of the way, this game is very fun. There's a lot to do and you have to think strategically and listen to what the people at your park want, don't want, or what they like and don't like or what they complain about. This makes it very challenging to make decisions on what you should add or take away, which also plays into the complicated financial part of the game. Also, with tools like ""OpenRct2"" this game has a bit of a ""cult following"" community (or amongst people like me who have seen people play the game on youtube with some humor), which does it a favor because people care about this game still by adding mods and multiplayer and new ideas to it.

The entire game is a blast, but some of my favorite game elements are: 1) designing awesome rollercoasters and other rides like go karts and water rides; 2) getting feedback from visitors and being able to use it to improve your park, 3) the general chatter and noise the people make is endearing, and 4) watching someone exit a ride that they love, and jumping in the air in excitement.I don't have a problem with (well done) games where you are basically just shifting around resources and reviewing spreadsheets, but this goes beyond that type of game, with a great balance between building, financial matters, employee guidance, visitor interactivity, and other matters.There's no major flaws IMO, but certain things might not be everyone's cup of tea. First, it can be a slow and leisurely game to play; Second, while it doesn't require a ton of micromanagement, nonetheless if you aren't willing to do at least *some* in-depth stuff (esp. with your workers) your park can become a mess; Third, the graphics and art are not bright and shiny and cartoonish in the way that a lot of business sims are (though for someone like me, this is a positive rather than a negative); Fourth, it's not in 3d, but like a 2.5d where you can look at things from 4 perspectives, and this can make seeing certain things difficult at times.Anyway, to sum up... if you are at all interested in this genre or theme, it'll almost certainly be worth it to get this.

The original RCT may as well have invented the ""Tycoon"" genre. Yes, there were competitors and RCT was not the first simulation game, but there's a reason no one remembers its competitors and why it seemed like after RCT every simulation game for the next 5 years had Tycoon in the title.The original RCT gave creative freedom to build whatever your imagination desired along with a set of increasingly challenging scenarios to test your strategy and management skills. RCT 2 perfected this formula. More coasters, more themes, more track options, more modes, more everything. Plus you could play with actual Six Flags and they finally added a straight sandbox.My gaming childhood was built on Smash Bros. and Rollercoaster Tycoon. RCT is the game that started it all.

There's a point at which something becomes so perfected that there's no reason to try to make a better version of it. It rarely happens in games, but RCT2, particularly with the OpenRCT2 mod, becomes the perfect theme park simulator game. After the mod, you have 1080p, 60fps, steam integration. Less crashes than the vanilla game. Autosaving. Quality-of-life fixes. Seriously, just check it out:https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Changes-to-original-gameThe visuals are timeless, look great, and are actually more straighforward to play with on a isometric grid rather than in complete 3 dimensions, especially when designing paths and tracks. Now count in the countless mods for the game, new rides, endless scenarios, porting of RCT1 scenarios, and the ridiculous amount of hours you can spend finishing even just the vanilla game scenarios, you've got a game for the ages.Sometimes I hear the question: ""If you were put in jail for 3 years and had no internet but could choose 1 game to play, what would it be?"" This game. The amount of content and time you can put into it is higher than almost any other offline game. What's more, with very simple mods you can also join other players in online play.As I said, this game has reached perfection due to the community around it. You don't need another theme park simulator. This one is all you will ever need, due to it's incredible depth of features and the enthusiastic open-source community behind it."

It crashes instantly when I try and launch it and the original installer is even included. What were they thinking?No, throw away the provided executable and use OpenRCT2 instead. That works flawlessly.Yet, at the same time, this is an excellent game. This is really nothing more than version 2.0 of the original Roller Coaster Tycoon. Same great game, but with some new features. This game could just as easily have been an expansion pack.Building attractions is always fun and there are plenty of scenarios to try. But it does kinda samey rather quickly. Seen one scenario, seen them all. Built one roller coaster, built them all. It is unquestionably still fun, but it gets repetitive rather quickly. This is a game you can fire up for a few hours when you are bored and need a little hobby project to work on for a while.One thing I noticed with the scenarios compared to the original is the overuse of decorative objects. You can easily get several thousand bucks just from removing the unmanageble messes that the scenarios come with. The issue isn't just the overuse, it's the type of unmanageable structures built for you. It is pretty much always hollow shells that are a pain to work with. Trying to edit them or put tracks/roads into them is an exercise in futility. They are built to look nice, not to be worked with.One thing I noticed is that it rarely matters what you build. Just build one of everything and guests will be happy. Maybe it gets more challenging with harder scenarios, but I doubt it. Ultimately the guests are very simple state machines that don't care about your attractions beyond the three key statistics for each one. It works, but it doesn't give a lot of depth.But overall? This is a great game. It's easy to forget the systems it runs on and just have fun working on a little pet project for a few hours."

The game itself runs beautifully on my laptop, although there is a weird occasional glitch where the window you use to load ans save games gets blacked out, and you have to ""guess-click"" to find your file.

The only problem: No OpenRCT2 features like multiplayer and cheat menu  exist, forcing you to buy the OpenRCT2 disc of of Craigslist or ebay.

76561198374560647,Recommended,285330,35430203,Posted: 2 October,all,Um Jammer Chelle,"RollerCoaster Tycoon was the first PC game I ever played. I spent countless hours just playing the first two scenarios alone. RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 however, was a game I never played until I bought it a couple months ago. It's safe to say that I love it as much as the original. Don't let my playtime fool you, I've put in at least 48 hours into it through ""OpenRCT2."" I highly recommend you play it through OpenRCT2, as it adds a bunch of cool features that weren't in the original game such as cheats and multiplayer. Anyways, I'll try and base my review on the original product alone. If you've ever played the original RCT, then it's basically more of that. It builds upon the foundation of the original game by adding more rides, scenarios, scenery, and other things. Your goal is to build a successful theme park in one of the various scenarios. You must build rides that entice guests to spend their hard earned cash. You also have to build shops, stalls, and bathrooms so that your guests can keep their needs high and stay in the park longer. You can build a variety of rides and add a variety of theming around them, but the most involved rides are the roller coasters. You can build them yourself, or choose from a variety of prebuilt coasters. The roller coaster building is probably my favourite part of the game. You can build the best rollercoaster ever, (and find out guests won't ride it because it's too intense) or you can build death traps that fly off the rails and kill your guests. The only downside is that you can't ride them in first person due to technical limitations of the time. However, you can watch guests ride them. Throw in some staff management, path management, and budgeting, and you've pretty much covered most of the gameplay. My biggest gripe with the game is probably the lack of ""free building maps."" The scenarios are cool, but there aren't as many open maps like there was in the first game. Another problem I have is how there aren't any maps with both a park entry fee and ride fees. This seems rather odd as most real life parks operate with both admission prices and ride prices. Finally there is no fast forward button in the base game. (OpenRCT2 adds some) This can make it a bit dull when you're waiting for enough income to build your next idea. The graphics have aged well. They have an art style that is cheerful and enjoying to look at. My only complaint with them is probably the isometric view. It adds some struggle to finding a good position for the camera to see things. Thankfully the see-through rides and scenery options exist to compensate for the lack of full camera control. I also love the sound mixing. The park is completely silent until you start adding rides with music. It really adds to the atmosphere of your park. One feature I forgot to mention earlier is the customization. It's top notch. From theming your park, to naming your rides, it's great. You can even rename the guests.Here's a list of the pros and cons for me.Pros:-Fantastic gameplay-Interesting scenarios-Charming graphics-Variety of rides-The roller coaster building-The customization-Hours upon hours of replayabilityCons:-Not as many open maps as RCT-Isometric view can be a bit confusing sometimes-Can't ride roller coasters-Not being able to charge for both rides and admission at the same time (OpenRCT2 fixes this)-No fast forward button (OpenRCT2 fixes this)In conclusion, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is one of the best tycoon games out there. It’s basically nothing but improvements over the original. If you're looking for a theme park management game, it doesn't get much better than this."
