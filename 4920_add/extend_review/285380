I had to remove my G27 in order to be able to navigate thru menu.No support for Track IR 5.Poor menu.Can`t hear the AI traffic sounds, and also the truck has no real sound.There is too much work ahead for this game and i`m sure that this game will never be completed.Same fate as Fernbus Simulator. Premium price, premium price for a bus also and poor development. This game is heading into that direction.Not recomended."

No wheel Support at all and i did manage  badly to get my pc 360 controller to work but its still not good. I was not impressed with the graphics compared to Ets2 or other driving sims I have. For a game in ""Advanced Stages"" it's very poor. Avoid for the time being untill they have got it fixed. Needs Wheel support and done to the standard of other good sims with ffb. I think Multi screen support would be nice  too. I am a fan of  Early Access but after playing with this for about 30 min i gave up as its not playable in its current state."

The driving mechanics are pretty good, I didn't expect that since I put more then 350 hours in ETS2.Give this sim a change, there are many things to add in the upcomming patches which they addressed!"

However there are things that have to be done. If you guys don't mind I'll make a list right here.:More static cameras for the interior of the truck, now you are pushed against the steering wheel.:Brake sensetivity, You cant really control how hard the truck brakes.:Decent mouse control for who ever likes to steer the truck with their mouse. I've tried alot of different settings but I justcant get it right.:Better dynamic lightning of the lights on the truck. For instance, turnsignals are bearly visible from the outside of thetruck.:Maybe some doors that you can really open and close. Open and close the doors of your trailer to inspect whats inside.I bet that wont be everything but these are the things that i took a notice of and would be really cool to see in the nearfuture! It's all about the details! Just take your time and this game will be awesome!"

Yes there is a lot  of work to do but if done right this has the protential to go far and maybe even as far as being a ETS2 killer. BUT like i said only if they get it right!! The truck i drove, drives better than they do in ets2 but the steering dose drift abit at high speed on the motorway so that needs to be tuned up a bit better. Also I think this would be great in VR so they need to add that too.The game runs very well at full setting and the AI isnt too bad either. Setting up the steering wheel was abit of a head ache but once i worked it out it worked pretty good. I cant get the indicators or hazards working but everything else seems to wotk ok.  ....Heres a list of things i thnk would make this game an ETS2 killer and that i think are needed ....... 1,Multi player would be a nice touch2, The ability to build your company but also see you own company trucks driving around doing there deliveries as you are doing yours.  Maybe even able to to deliveries with 2 of your company trucks in convoy ( you and an AI truck?)3,More truck brands4, Obivously keep extending the map size and in to other countries5,The steering wheels set up could be made easier to work out.6, Im hoping there is going to be a real noticable power difference in the different trucks and a real noticable diffence in the weight of the different loads/trailers and how they affect the trucks!7, Doors that open on the trucks and even the trailers would be a nice touch!8, A driver in the truck or some sort of avatar9, The interior of the trucks need bringing up to the standard of ets2I will and more to this list over time for the devs  if they are interested but i need to put more time in to this first......Yes this game is still very rough round the edges but its EARLY ACCESS  so Im looking forward to seeing what these guys do with this. They are off to a good start i think!"

,Not Recommended,285380,30830163,Posted: 30 March,all,~Darksmile,Maybe its because it's a new game and there aren't a lot of video's to show you how to do it but I find it a really dificult game and not really good explaned.. Your getting in to the game without any tutorials or anything you can read a quick tutorial but I don't find it really help full it would be better to have a real tutorial because know your just put in the game and you need to find it on your own

76561198007923471,Recommended,285380,33927156,Posted: 31 July,all,MOMO & YUNA,"** Revised review **My sister gave a bad comment before and that led this review to receive many negative comments before. So now I revise the review.-----------------------------------In general:The game is in a very early stage which means it's still far from the finish line. But it has a solid foundation, the potential and it is heading to the right direction to become the most and the best realistic truck driving simulator game. (I have been playing and modding the famous Euro Truck Simulator 2 ""ETS2"" and American Truck Simulator ""ATS"" for hundreds of hours and still playing).From what i understand, the developer of On The Road ""OTR"" aims to make this game a serious and realistic truck simulator game, not an arcade one, which i am very glad because i am a person who plays only realistic and simulator games.Being in a very early access stage, this means you can expect a lot of unfinished things and bugs in the game, so please don't go crazy (like my sister before) when you find something not working, and you will find a lot.My scores:Graphic quality 6/10 (for now)Even it looks outdated but it's not really that bad. It is enough to make you feel the city driving. And i am sure i will be better in the future when the game is more developed.Truck physics 7/10 (for now)I must admit that OTR's physics is better than ETS2's vanilla physics obviously. But it still has a lot of room to improve. At least this aspect is also heading to the right direction. Since physics is everything to a truck simulator, this is probably the most important aspect of the game. I hope the developer will focus on this.Sound quality 7/10 (for now)Since i am not an expert of truck sound, i can only say that it's not bad at all, but still not very immersive or i think still a lot of room to improve here also.Truck control (N/A)I cannot give a score here because the Logitech Steering Wheel did not work. But i am sure it will be fixed in future game updates. So only the keyboard could control the truck at that time and it's very awkward for us to drive with a keyboard.Gameplay 7/10 (for now)- I really like the idea in the game that we have our own trailer or container (i'm not sure how to call it) which in ETS2 we cannot own a trailer.- The driver can walk on foot ! (this is exciting for me because I wish that ETS2 had this feature).- The loading and unloading areas are still pretty much empty (lack of decorations) but i like the locations such as in a very big port full of containers while some located in an narrow alley. I think that is realistic.- The cities are huge ! and have realistic complex road networks. The city is obviously much bigger than ETS2 and has more roads.- The surrounding such as sidewalks, pedestrians need more objects because now still look pretty much empty.We did not play very long because of the fact that our Logitech steering wheel did not work, it's very difficult for us to drive with the keyboard without hitting some thing. But i can see that this aspect OTR is heading to the right direction and/or better than the others.My verdict:Buy it now if ....1. You are a serious fan of trucks or truck simulators and you are doing well financially, you should support this game. Because like i mentioned before, this game is heading to the direction to become the best in its kind in the future.2. You are OK with unfinished games and you are willing to find bugs and report for improvement.Wait for the official release if ....You have a financial limitation or not doing well at the moment (like myself). So i had to ask for a refund because i have been suffering a financial problem. But i will buy it again in the future for sure when my financial recovers.I hope this review help you make the right decision. And thank you for all the comments below."

,Not Recommended,285380,34917549,Posted: 13 September,all,WulfGamesYT,"I love the theme of the game and all but at the current moment (I understand it's still in early access) but it really isnt worth the £12, there just seems to be a lot of problem with the lag and graphics. It doesnt feel like a simulator at the moment. I would love to see an improvement to the overall FPS and graphics (I have a pretty decent PC with good specs and it doesnt run well at all), the following things could be considered to be added in future updates:- Ability to move the third person camera with mouse and joystick so you can see all angles of your lorry- Add more lorry makes and work on interior- Fix the issue with the shadows being fuzzy and flashy- Work on the avatars and lorry company icons as it makes the game seem very, very unprofessional (dont use clipart use proper gfx art)Thanks for reading!"

,Not Recommended,285380,30903215,Posted: 2 April,all,JoSh [GER],"Ok, i bought the game five days after release, and refunded.I bought it again today, and will refund again, if steam will allow this.And i will not buy it again.The facts:Negative:- not possible to assign a specific controller. the controller, which is marked as DEFAULT for windows will take the point.- no trackir support - you have to look around with your mouse.- driving feels like a the road is coated with oil or something. at above 60km/h it is more difficult than ets2 at 120km/h and at above 80 km/h it becomes nearly uncontrollable (thrustmaster t500 rs , 1080 degree settings, FFB off)- AI is heavy on the brake. on the highway, motorway or whatever (in germany, it's Autobahn) they're braking like every 100m for ... nothing ... i have no idea why. they do not drive faster than about 110km/h either.- i do not understand the retarder, due to the lack of control lights or movement of a lever or whatever. the switch for the two horns has an animated switch below the climate control, though (wtf?)- it's early access, yeah, but delivering loads is not fun, because you can drive into that tiny greennish thingy and you got the load / deliver the load. no parking at all necessary. you can, probably, if you like, but ... yeah. beside that, the company areas are ... small, ok, but ... i have no words. i just don't like them.pros:- graphics are ok, not awesome of overwhelming, but ok, comparable with ets1 i guess- assigning the buttons and axis works IF YOU ACCEPT THE GAME DEVICE THE GAME CHOOSES. see above.- the sound is ok. in fact it's good, at least the ones in the truck itself. engine etc. i have not listened to sounds outside the truck or not made by it.all in all, i cannot recommend the game at the given time, due to the too minimalistic configuration settings of the input devices.the game needs proper physics, the current one's are crap.the ai needs improvement. it's crap as wellthe career mode or the game contents won't be judged that hard, due to early access status, but at least a drivable demo has to be finished when released as early access.in my opinion early access titles are some kind of free ride ticket to publish unfinished stuff to make money, and not to let the audience take part in the developement process.I'm sorry, improve and convince my, maybe I will buy it a third time and keep it afterwards."

As far as I saw the game, the game has a lot of potencial to become something awesome. Very cool mechanic that you can walk around the truck and enter the truck at your own choosing. But how do you exit truck? Tryed clicking everything, no help. Some issues that I had:Gps screen - hard to see gps route with it being purple and roads brown. Unzoom the screen a bit, currently you see the turn as you are doing itFront axle -  wheels at wierd angle when you do full lockKey mapping - it might be better to just map stuff to one key (like lights) and just cycle thru optionsAccelerator - there is noticable lagg when you press the accelator, you hear jump in revs but truck movs 1 sec laterWheel - no wheel support ( I read that it's coming soon)Mirrors - not adjustable jet (or i couldn't hit the butons)Zoom - Needs interior zoomCruise control - Not there and so neededSound - Too loud in the cab, like sound was recorded inside hood and just pasted in cabAir - tweak air consumption, and shortage of air shood lock all axles from moving and not just lock steering on front.All in all, the game has a lot of potencial and I'll keep on following and playing.Full review here :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8TMCVXwEsE"

,Recommended,285380,30945669,Posted: 4 April,all,Gabriel,"For an early access game, it is very developed. The bad thing is that it doesn't have a tutorial and you need to read the Input Options in Options before you start because you will need to know what keys are used for what action.The truck has real automatic gears and there is no option for simple automatic gears like in ETS. Keep this in mind because you will need to switch to reverse and press forward to actually back up. Personally, I like this type of simulation, although they should add the simple one as an option for not scarring some players away.If you played Farm Expert 17 then you are familiar with this type of driving.You will need to press R and T to go up and sown into gears. They are as follows when looked down from the driver seat to your right: +D  D  N  R  -R.  Look at that knob and press R or T till you get the idea of how it works.I can run the game on low with minimum lag but I saw the game looks quite good at max graphics. It acctually looks better and it is better optimized then Bus Simulator 17. Hopefully, the devs will work further on optimization.I am only driving with the keyboard, as I do the other driving games, so from this point of view, the truck runs pretty smoothly on streight roads but it is bit wonky on trurns. There should be added a turn sensitivity slider They need to do a little more work on this turning too.If you don't feel like you want to support this game development by paying 15 euros for it, then do not to buy it at this stage just for giving a negative review. It has potential and it may be worth to play later on when it will be officially released."
