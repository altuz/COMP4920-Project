The game was flawless in every aspect: graphically stunning, highly challenging and most importantly, very well designed with great score / gameplay mechanics and sharp player controls.The ""World Ignition"" version that just came out takes that great game and makes it even better, without changing its core that we, CC veterans loved. It now features more game modes, one extra ship, better graphics in higher resolution, TATE mode, plus many Steam goodies like Cloud, Achievements and Leaderboards. In my opinion, Crimzon Clover World Ignition is THE shmup of the decade and on no occasion should it be missed or ignored by gamers, shmuppers and non-shmuppers alike, that enjoy great video games made with care and attention by their dedicated developers.Thumbs up, all the way!"

If you like Cave games, then you won't be disapointed. It's a sort of mixture between Ketsui (little timer while you have to score before it reach 0 again) Dodonpachi Daioujou or Saidaioujou (with a Break mode, similar of the Hyper system), 4 differents modes to play in Arcade version (harder), 2 in Novice version (easy).Boost most is a mixture between super fast bullets like Mushihimesama Futari Original when you reach the highest rank, only the difference is, rank is at maximum already at stage 2 if you played good, didn't bomb or die. Adding super sonic fast suicide bullets on top of that.Original would be a mixture of Mushihimesama Futari Maniac and Dodopachi Daioujou/Saidaioujou. Slower bullets but more busy partterns. In my opinion this is the ""easiest"" mode of the game.Unlimited is not for beginner, extremely busy pattern all the time, nothing comparable to this, it's all about cancelling the bullet with your lock before the screen gots too busy. Euphoric, yet very very very hard.A Time attack mode is also available, only one stage that you have to score as high as possible before the timer reach 0.To resume, it's a fantastic game that you can play (sort of) cajually or with very complex strategy to optimise your score. Be warned, this game is really really difficult ;)"

76561198062135979,Recommended,285440,10375097,"Posted: 6 June, 2014",all,DJSessum,"In this review, I will cover how this port compares to the original doujin version.Crimzon Clover was originally released as a Comiket doujinsoft CD in 2010. Brilliant of a game as it was, the act of actually playing it presented nothing but headaches for non-Japanese players. As a western PC gamer, playing CC required either changing your Windows region (provided you could get a hold of the physical game), or downloading a pirated version. And after that, the game wasn't 100% controller-friendly. I remember having to use JoyToKey to get the joystick of my Fighting Stick 3 to function. Nothing too horrible, but the UI of the initial release just wasn't polished enough.Now we have World Ignition, which is nothing short of a blessing due to the simple fact that it makes CC so easy and painless for newcomers to dig into. No need to hunt down the physical disc or feel any of that pirating guilt! Here's a breakdown of the improvements of this port:-TATE (vertical screen) mode, which was not available in the doujin version. Nice.-Training mode now gives access to every stage and boss out of the box, no unlocking required. In the doujin version, you had to unlock each stage (and their respective difficulties) to practice with using the medals you accumulated through each playthrough.-A new soundtrack has been added. I prefer the original one, but thankfully you can decide in the menu which one you want to hear.-UI presentation is simply much more pleasing to view and navigate.-Many, many languages have been added, which is interesting for a game that requires no reading skills whatsoever to properly enjoy. But hey, they're there!-Online leaderboards, which the doujin version didn't have for some reason.-Surprisingly, there's a name entry screen (which is odd considering that they could've just used your Steam name), but sadly in this version, there's no tanks in the background to shoot with the cursor. :(-Gameplay is pretty much the same and unchanged.There's quite a few shmups on Steam, some are excellent, while many are meh or just plain garbage. CCWI is one of the excellent ones. Get it."

,Recommended,285440,10413303,"Posted: 9 June, 2014",all,Squire Grooktook,"Crimzon Clover is a doujin bullet hell shmup made by one person (well, two if you count the musician) that was so well designed and professional that it was inducted into actual arcades. Now, the even further polished and refined arcade version arrives on Steam, and it's absolutely essential for anyone with even a fleeting interest in the shoot em up genre.CC's bullet hell action has you dodging and shooting manically through a series of 5 stages and a host of boss fights. Aiding you are a lock on laser, that allows you to target enemies around you and awards a score bonus for destroying multiple enemies simultaneously, and ""Break Mode"", a super powered state which is recharged the more aggressively you play, and allows you to double your speed, fire power, and points gained when active, and then quadruple them if you can fill up the break meter a second time before it ends.CC is an absolute blast to play. The stages are creative, varied, and intense. Some of them are quite long, but never overstay their welcome and always stay interesting throughout. The bosses feel fresh and exciting with cool gimmicks and fundamentally fun patterns.  And targeting and breaking feels incredibly unique from any other game in the genre. One minute you're passively biding your time to get the maximum lock on while dodging bullets, the next you're turning the dodging action of the game on its head as you rocket around at break neck speed unleashing your own bullet hell upon enemies. Every moment of the game feels unique and compelling.It's also very content heavy. It's got 4 modes and 4 ships with their own unique play styles.  The game is very challenging as well, on the arcade difficulty (there are novice modes, for less confident players) it may take some more time than a full length rpg to 1 credit clear it, and the scoring systems provide immense depth and competition with other players that could take years to master. CC is absolutely worth every penny and more.This game is easily tied with Skullgirls and Rogue Legacy as my favorite game on Steam. I cannot recommend it enough!"

This may have been fixed in the latest patch, but I don't know for sure.Other thoughtsThis game embodies everything that makes shoot-em-up games so great. I've seen it called ""the Cave Story of shmups"", and that's honestly the perfect way to describe this game; both Cave Story and Crimzon Clover completely define their respective genres. Whether you're a shmup veteran or someone who's never played a shoot-em-up before, everyone should give this game a try.It's a masterpiece."
76561198109626876,Recommended,285440,10375136,"Posted: 6 June, 2014",all,TwitchinSal,"While most gamers haven't heard of it, Crimzon Clover is a bit of an icon to fans of scrolling shoot-em-up (or ""shmup"") games, and widely regarded as one of the top amateur-developed titles out there: its original PC edition was so well-received, in fact, that the game was given a spit-shine and re-released to Japanese arcades on the digital Nesica format. Few non-Japanese gamers were destined to ever try it...until now, that is, since that version has beaten the odds and made it Westward as ""World Ignition.""In case you needed to hear it, your goal here is to blow up lots of stuff, collect lots of shiny stars, and not die: you've got a handful of aircraft to choose from, each of which is armed with both a standard shot (which is always at ""full"" power, so dying won't hamstring you) and an unlimited-use ""lock-on"" weapon, which covers a large chunk of the screen and can zap lots of enemies at once, but deploying it slows your movement, so take care not to unleash it if you need to boogie. As you wreak havoc you'll fill up an energy meter, visible in the upper right: once it's got a bit of juice you gain access to a smart bomb, which will damage everything onscreen and give you a moment of invincibility to catch your breath: you can only stock one at a time, but refilling the meter enough for another one doesn't take too long, so definitely use it when you need it.If you let the meter continue to fill all the way up, however, hitting the bomb button will instead activate ""break mode,"" which is where things get interesting: while this state lasts, your firepower is boosted, and so are the points gained from blasting baddies (and if you can get the meter all the way up again before the ""break"" runs out, you can enter a ""double break,"" which juices things up even more). While surviving is just a matter of moving, shooting and bombing at the right  times, racking up high scores involves constantly juggling your shot, lock-on, and energy meter to get the most points possible out of every target - enemies send loads of attacks your way, but only the small, shining ""hit area"" at the very center of your ship can take damage, so if you can weave that tiny bit of yourself through the dangerous bits you'll make it out the other side in one piece.While the basic idea of the game never changes, there are several modes here that put a different spin on things: aside from the standard ""Normal"" mode, there's ""Boost"" mode (""breaks"" are activated automatically and don't run out until you bomb or lose a life, but enemies get tougher the longer you can keep it going), ""Unliimited"" mode (an extra-tough challenge for veteran shmuppers), and ""Time Attack"" mode (a fixed course where you have infinite lives but only three minutes to rack up as many points as you can). Normal and Boost also have ""Novice"" variations, which are easier than the standard ones and well-suited for those looking to get their feet wet and build some confidence before moving up; you can also practice individual stages to shore up spots that are giving you trouble.Though certain sections of the game will smack you down hard and suddenly enough to make you wince, don't let that dissuade you from giving it a shot: if you can manage to get through the front door without feeling intimidated by the screenshots full of unfriendly fire, you'll find one of the most polished PC shooters in existence waiting for you: moreover, it's a bit of a miracle that the gaming gods have even seen fit to bring such a little-known gem to our shores in any form, at a steal of a price to boot, and they deserve recognition for making it happen. If you still hold any love, or even curiosity, for the simple, deep, hard-edged and irrepressibly pure arcade titles of old, by all means look this one up: releases of its caliber are all too rare these days."

76561197961453248,Recommended,285440,13150965,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,ChadFromCanada,"Full disclosure - I am not an expert shmup player.  I can't beat games on hard difficulties, or on only one continue, and I don't have a vertically oriented monitor/television to play them on.  But there's something incredible about playing a great shmup, when everything comes together - great music, varied enemies and bullet patterns, and game mechanics/controls that just make you feel powerful and make everything fun.  This is what Crimson Clover is to me: a fun, extremely difficult bullet-hell shmup, but one that can still be enjoyed by the casual fan.  I probably had to use an average of 10+ continues each time I've played through the game so far, but it was still a fun and interesting experience.  The three ships have different bullet patterns and stats (Type III moved around the screen quickly but has a narrow bullet spread), and it took me a few plays to even realize that you could press a button that not only narrows your bullet spread to help concentrate on a larger enemy/boss, but also locks onto a bunch of enemies and fires off some lock-on missiles (reminds me a bit of Panzer Dragoon, or maybe Raystorm?  I think it's a fairly common feature in a lot of shmups - and speaking of powerful, Type II's lockon attack is badass) - I guess I would have known it earlier had I actually watched the tutorial but I really was able to just jump into the game without having done so and it was still fun as hell.  Bombs erase all bullets on screen at the time and destroying certain enemies also removes their bullets from the screen, and you can (and must, in many cases) use these features in order to survive.  The first I activated Double Break, wow, talk about a bulletstream.  There is an arcade mode with an Unlimited Mode available, and should be perfect for veterans of the series who might find novice mode too easy (novice mode still has a ton of bullets on screen at once, but even after 3-4 playthroughs, and as someone who isn't all too good at the genre in general, I was starting to excel at dodging/memorizing certain patterns or using my bombs/destroying enemies to remove bullets).  Most of the shmups I've played are on the Dreamcast or Xbox 360 (or Jamestown or other indie ones on PC) and I have to say that this one ranks up there with one of the most fun I've played (I'd have to put it up there with Jamestown and Deathsmiles).  The framerate fluctuated between just under and just over 60 FPS no matter how much was going on on-screen (and with the amount of explosions, stars and bullet sprites that can be on screen at once, especially with double break activated, that's nice).  The only real complaints I have are that it took me a little while to figure out how to get my controls working (I wanted to use a 360 controller and start is not mapped to start [it's mapped to Y, which is actually helpful if you need to pause in the heat of the moment, but the game doesn't have button prompts for the 360 controller, hence ""partial controller support"", but it works fine out of the box], so I had to press random buttons on the keyboard until it activated the menu, and it turned out I had pressed one of the second player keyboard buttons, so when I first started the game I had to select two ships and then just let the second player ship get blown up).  It also took a few tries for the game to properly keep track of my video settings, and you need to tweak the stretch settings to get the game to fill the screen on 1920x1080 resolution.  A patch to include native 360 controller support and to make the resolution settings a bit less cryptic would be cool, but are not really all that necessary since you'll probably get the hang of it quickly.  Whether you're a casual fan of shmups or a hardcore bullet-hell player, I can't recommend the game enough.  It is also forgiving enough with the continues that it could serve as a great introduction to the genre, mainly because it embodies much of what I like about any shmup (cool looking sprites, great music, varied ship types and the explosions, bullet sprites and the way the ships control and destroy everything in sight just makes you feel powerful)."

However, i’ve found Crimson Clover to be fairly accessible to someone who hasn’t played bullet hells or is even a pro with other, more basic shoot 'em ups. There is no story, but seeing as it is a score chaser, it isn’t expected, if you want a story, you’d be best off with a game like Astebreed. There are four ships but their differences are unfortunately, pretty minor. One has a basic spread attack, the other one is focused. Every ship has a lock on attack (allowing for a very impressive fight with a mini-boss on the final stage), but these only differ in visual appearances. The levels and enemies/bosses are surprisingly detailed, but you most likely won’t notice without dying (this game demands focus), and all the bosses are multistage (including miniboses). The music, although fairly simple, is great and very fitting to the type of action that happens during the game.Overall, I give this game a 8/10*edit: I've finally unlocked the fourth ship."

The bosses and mini bosses steal the show with their colorfully spastic attacks, specially level 5's boss.

On the other hand, fans of bullet hells have little excuse to pass on this gem.Crimzon Clover doesn't have extremely elaborate attack patterns like you would see in a Touhou game, but what it does have is bullets, lots of bullets, so many bullets that if you tallied up all the bullets in Mars Matrix, Jamestown, and Ikaruga combined Crimzon Clover might very well still have them beat - and that's on the standard difficulty. The enemies aren't the only ones with lots of firepower though as players can fairly easily fill up part a gauge to use bombs (though the amount the gauge needs to be filled increases with each bomb usage), wait until the gauge is full to enter the destructive and score-multiplying 'break mode' or fill up two gauges to enter the absurdly powerful 'double break mode'.Crimzon Clover also provides a good chunk of variety for players. There are two difficulties (and possibly even a third, hidden difficulty of some sort) as well as four distinctive modes of play, three different ships, local and online leaderboards, and the option for local co-op. Crimzon Clover also graciously provides the option of unlimited continues for less-skilled fans of the genre (I lost track around the 30 continue mark on my playthrough) and comes with a customary 'true' endboss for anyone capable of performing a 1 Credit Clear. In terms of stages, Crimzon Clover is a bit on the low side at 5, but these are five fairly lengthy stages, non-boss enemies very much pose a threat and do not simply exist for the sake of points, and many stages even have a full-on midboss.Lastly, Crimzon Clover is simply beautiful to look at. There is an astonishing sense of speed to the game as panoramas rush past the player and nearly every enemy has multiple moving parts and intricate animations. Add to this a fast-paced soundtrack and plenty of explosions and Crimzon Clover is nearly worth buying for the aesthetics alone, to say nothing of the fact that it is almost certainly one of the best bullet hells out there and possibly even a strong contender for outright being *the* best in the genre."

They are games that I absolutely adore, where the focus is that primal arcade style of gameplay where the goal is to get good at it and nothing else. And I absolutely suck at them.So, i'm not an expert on shmups, if that's what you are searching here. However, my review is intended for the people who don't usually play this kind of game and are somehow interested.Not only is this a shmup, but it's a bullet hell shmup. Those words might send you imediate images of screens filled with colorful bullets that seem completely undodgeable, and you wouldn't be wrong thinking that.It's a very fast paced and frenetic game where your eyes are completely glued to the screen in awe of the spectacle happening in front of you, making impossible dodges and destroying all kinds of machinery shooting different patterns of bullets at you, complemented by a gorgeous pixel art and a bombastic soundtrack.The great thing about the game is how it eases you into it, with a Novice mode, which really isnt as easy as the name might make it sound. The bullets are less intense, but you wont make it to the end without wasting a few continues on your first tries.There is also a great mechanic where you get to use a bullet erasing bomb that is available when you fill a meter, saving your♥♥♥♥♥alot of times.Since you dont have to waste quarters to get continues, you have to set your own goals for yourself, otherwise you can just keep on dying and moving forward with unlimited continues.Luckily the game teases you with secret content if you manage to beat the last boss with just one continue. Even in Novice mode this proved to be a challenging task. But the thrill and rush I got when I reached that last boss on my first continue, beat him and faced the true final boss really was something amazing.A myriad of bullets flashing and homing on me, as I held on for dear life with one life left. Beating that boss on my first try totally made the game worth it for me.After that, you have the Arcade mode and the even harder Unlimited mode , which I have no chance of beating on one continue an im totally fine with that, and other modes that slightly change the way you play the game.People like to be elitists about Dark Souls being a game for ""real gamers"" and ""not for casuals"", but this game makes Dark Souls look like a Kirby game. Only a handful of players will master this game.Buy it for a well spent weekend, and if you enjoy it as much as I do, you might find yourself spending time trying to beat Arcade mode in one continue, even if deep down you know your hands and brain have no chance of dodging every goddamn bullet the game is throwing at you.10/10 would scream at my screen again"

It follows standard bullethell ideas, three ships, a stage where you go forward, shoot things, your overpowered, and everything explodes. What it does differently is that EVERYTHING IS BIG AND LOUD AND IN YOUR FACE! You can fire, shoot homing rockets, and do something called Boost Mode where you get even more overpowered and the screen becomes a deathtrap to increase your points. In the first stage alone there are almost 700 things to make boomies out of, and it has your fair share of difficulties. Well... 4 of them. You got Boost Mode which means infinite Boost Mode (Very Easy mode), Standard (Easy), Unlimited ♥♥♥♥♥♥on a♥♥♥♥♥♥Extremely Hard), and Time (egh?).Pros - Over the top madness mixed with standard bullethell ideas makes for a tasty treat of death and destruction. Very well made means good FPS, score is very large treating you with a nice 10 Billion points for no lifes lost so scores are more diverse, good fun all around.Cons - Since everything is dying horribly it's hard to see your ship very well. Most of the time you caught up in killing everything that you commit suicide out of pure fun and it gets really annoying mixed with the very very tight controls. Recommend using something that will help movement, it's very wild and fast and sometimes unpredictable. Lack of settings mean smaller screens will be shot down, lack of settings to control to mass destruction of death from keeping you from suiciding, and last but not least only 4 modes and it wouldn't be so bad if the difficulty wasn't so wonky.It has a lot of downfalls but the pros keep it standing firmly.

This game does a great job of testing one's reaction time, dodging abilities, and resistance to siezures.However, there are a few issues that I do have with this game. It can be too difficult and time-consuming at times. With some over-reliance on save scumming that only becomes more of a problem as the levels get longer and more difficult. Even on Novice mode, the game can be incredibly frustrating if you're trying as hard as is possible to avoid getting killed, having to restart levels over and over. But then again, I'm new to this genre; the best advice I can give if you're like me is:- Stick to the Novice difficulty mode and ignore the Original difficulty.- Play it purely for catharsis and don't even bother trying to get a high score. It soon becomes extremely difficult to reach the end of a level (let alone the whole game) without losing at least one life, or having to hit Continue (thus resetting your score to zero) at least once.The other problem I have is that the second ship that you acquire in the game is basically useless due to it's extremely variable bullet spread, making it more of a liability to use than all the others. Also, the fourth ship feels a little overpowered.Regardless of its difficulty however, the rules do remain fair and consistent. I'm still having a blast with Crimzon Clover, and I'm sure hardcore Bullet Hell and Shoot-'Em Up fans wil get a kick out of it. Good level design, fair and challenging (but occasionally frustrating) gameplay, cool Boss fights, an elegant art style, a funky soundtrack, and a lot of spectacle give this game a very 'arcade' feel."

It is very up front and honest about its influences but manages to take the tropes of a given genre and make it into something fresh and new, which may be the wankiest thing ever said about this game.Long story short, it's an excellent shooter. Various elements recall the best games from Cave, Raizing, and even Triangle Service without feeling derivative of any of them. Except Cave. The DoDonPachi vibe is strong with this one but the play system is different enough that it's more like a knowing nod to one of the greats than a pure ripoff.Graphically the game is a bit hit and miss. Some sprites and backgrounds seem a tad too scaled up and as a result are more pixelated than you'd expect. The background variety is quite good though. Weapon and bullet graphics are excellent. Colorful enough that you never feel cheated, unlike every single game ever made by Raizing/8ing.If you like shooters, you need this game.

The game has been designed extremly well and it is actually fun and I mean super fun to play. It feels like you are in control of everything which is happening around you and if you get destroyed, it's your own fault. I'm not even big fan of huge explosions, but in this game it's how you register succesfully destroyed enemy and it just feels so DAMN good. Dodge n' destroy, baby.Couple major reasons which made me really curious about this game, was because the game was made by one person, if you don't count composer and it became so famous at Japan, that they even made own version to arcades.Most people who speak ill of these indie games with retro stylish graphics, don't understand the real reason why they're suddenly so popular among indie developers, just because they're so obsessed by the graphics.

I thought it was hard then, but this right here is something else completely. I didn't know you can make something more challenging than it was before, and even though I'm consistently getting my sphincter torn apart 10 minutes into arcade BOOST mode and 3 stages into UNLIMITED mode, the bigger numbers, the extra breakable parts, more manic patterns, and autistic routing has definitely made it more enjoyable and satisfying compared to the first time I went through it. Crimzon Heart's second form also feels like an actual TLB now instead of some sad attempt at bullet spam. Being given a taste of my own lock-on attack was a damn nice touch, really added to its ridiculous killing intent in its final desperate attempt at survival. Its patterns, combined with both original and arranged music, gives me goosebumps everytime. Out of all the TLBs I've fought, this one really makes it feel like you're both trying to kill each other, especially so during its final attack in which the bullets get faster and more dense the longer you let it live.If I could refund it and purchase this game along with all its DLC at full price, I definitely would.

There is quite a bit of room for individual game play improvement with the multiple modes catering to one's skill levels. The Crimzon Clover Dev team continually listens to feedback from the players and bring quick updates to hone the game to perfection. With the new resolution feature in the latest update, I will now be able to play this on my ""Tated"" (vertical monitor orientation) Candy Cab arcade machine.  Indeed, as other reviewers have mentioned, this indie game was given a true arcade release in Japan via the Taito NESiCA LIVE arcade System.I stated ""Crimzon Clover Dev team"" but this true indie STG  is created by one individual from Japan whose background is that of a literal arcade Shoot em up scoring world champion who initially made this for the Doujin (PC home brew) scene. It was obviously good enough for Taito to bring it on board with revamped graphics and game play tweaked for the arcade.This is a master product.The price point for this arcade quality STG gem is a jaw dropping value for the level of content within.Playing through the game , I get the feeling that it's a homage to certain prior shoot em up titles regarding stage set design.  I am loosely reminded of Dragon Blaze in the third level with the giant red flowers. CAVE influence with other subtle nods to other shoot em up titles/companies weaved throughout the game levels  adds to the richness without becoming a clone.A sort of labor of love encompassing aspects of the STG or Shoot em up Canon.Surely, this may seem like a gush review but it's excellent. Add the narration of it's humble upbringings crafted by a master player which hits a Cinderella status with arcade and now world wide Steam release and the certificate of excellence is etched in gold by it's very history and path."

It's hard to tell it's a doujin game as opposed to a commercial one The general gameplay may remind you of a mix of things (Dondonpachi, Raystorm), but the main thing that makes this stand out? The break mode system, which not only allows the bulk of the scoring but also provinging a boost to your firepower. Double Break mode is something that has to be seen to understand what a boost to score and firepower that is.This is a port of the Arcade version which was previously japanese only, and with it come some changes, mainly the limiter shop being removed but in return you get 3 ships to start (and one to unlock, though easier than the original), all levels accessible in training and free play in most modes (gotta 1cc if you want to see the True Final boss). The general changes are double edged, making the game easier in some ways and harder compared to the original game (stage 3 in particular). But for less confident players, there's Novice versions of both original and boost mode (I'll get on to this later)There's three modes to the game:Original: The game's normal mode, where you can see the full scoring system in effect.Unlimited: This is basically to CC what Ultra is to Cave games and Lunatic is to Touhou games: The game unleashing bullet hell to its fullest extent.Simple (original game only): A toned down game in both difficulty and mechanics which used your break/bomb bar to determine rank/points/attack power.Boost (World Ignition only): It's Simple Mode's rank dynamics taken up to 11 as when your Break/Bomb bar fills, you will enter break mode that goes on until you lose a life or you bomb and the longer you're in it, the more the game's difficulty ramps up during it.Time attack: in the spirit of the old Hudson star soldier caravan games, this has you with a limited time (and unlimited lives) to score as much as possible.And each mode has a small tutorial bit before you start that explains things pretty well.The sound track is very good with separate stage musics for normal and unlimited (by default but you can change them around in the options) with its bosses each getting their own theme. Not sure if it'd justify spending extra for the soundtrack, though it slightly makes up for the removal of the sound test that was in the original.And the plot? There is none beyond ""Blow them up""Update:resolution/screen issues fixed.Highly recommended for any shump fan."

Mastering in what parts to use this and when simply dodging bullets is the basis of this game. But it goes even further mechanically as it allows you to fill the bar faster by getting a higher multiplier with the lock-on laser and also has a slower filling secondary break bar which fills your break bar when you enter break mode which allow you to enter break mode while being in break mode into a double break mode that is one of the most insane things I ever saw in a shmup... But however leaves your break bar completely dry.Those mechanics completely change how the game feels, while is still a bullet hell, it also remembers shmups of memorization and optimization like r-type or ikaruga as you have to menage your break bar and know where to use it.Now add the fact that it looks great, has a awesome soundtrack, a good novice mode, great bosses way above your usual bullet hell boss(well maybe not the first one) and a scoring system that is actually sane. Then you end with one of the best smups ever done and definitely the best shmup on steam.If you like bullets hells then you need to have this, if you like shmups but was never keen on bullet hells you might find one you enjoy here and if you ever had a passing interest in shmups but never knew where to start this is it."

Crimzon Clover is one of those games, but contrary to popular belief, bullet hell games are not impossible; very difficult yes, but not impossible. In fact, Crimzon Clover is one of the more forgiving games in the genre in most modes, and it's a great game to get into the genre with as I'll later explain:The original Crimzon Clover was an indie game released by CLOVER-TAC, a player with a few world record bullet hell game scores: this original release was a Japan only, physical disc only release (which is now out of print). Despite the fact this was an indie release, the original game had pretty impressive production values, comparable to bullet hell games released by major developers like CAVE[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAVE_(company)]Due to this success, the game was picked up for distribution in Japanese arcades by Taito through their line of Nesica digital download capable arcade machines. For this arcade release the game recieved a new shiny coat of paint, a new game mode (replacing an old mode in the original), and a few gameplay touch ups. This Steam release is a port of the arcade version.Now onto the actual game: You can select from two overall difficulty settings: Arcade and Novice. These names explain themselves, as Arcade difficulty is the same as the arcade machine's difficulty setting (tough but fair), while novice mode tones down the difficulty a bit to allow new comers to try out this genre of game without too much frustration. Once you select a difficulty, you get to pick from three different gameplay modes: Original, which is basically the default style of gameplay, Boost mode, where the game difficulty dynamically increases based on how long you stay in break mode (explained later), and Unlimited mode, which usually looks like that video I linked above. Gameplay is standard, fly, shoot and dodge, with bullets only killing you if they hit the small golden orb in your ship's center, but there are three mechanics that are a bit different from most bullet hell games: in most bullet hell games you get a few smart bombs every life that you can trigger instantly to destroy all bullets on the screen. In crimzon clover however you get an energy meter that fills up as you score points; once you reach a certain point on the meter (the point goes further up the meter with each bomb you use in a life), you can trigger a bomb. However, if you let the meter fill all the way up, you can enter Break mode, where your ship gets a big power increase and your main point multiplier is pumped up until the timer runs out (except in Boost mode where you have to manually end break mode with a bomb). Furthermore, if you can fill up the meter a second time before break mode ends, you can enter double break mode, where your ship gets even more powerful and your multiplier jumps even higher. The third mechanic that's a bit different is the lock on system. Besides your standard forward shot, you can hold the lock on button to create a transparent barrier around you: any enemy that enters this barrier gets locked onto (you can lock onto the same enemy multiple times as well), and as soon as you release the lock on button, you release quick homing lasers or missiles at whatever you targeted; furthermore the more enemies you destroy in a single lock on burst, the higher your secondary score multiplier (which vanishes after a short time) becomes.. With these mechanics in place, Crimzon Clover is much more forgiving than most bullet hell games, but that doesn't mean it's not a challenge to beat without continues: you will be beaten down over and over until you memorize bullet patterns and refine your dodging skills (beating a bullet hell game by using continues means nothing by the way!). However, if you do manage to conquer this game, you'll feel an incredible sense of accomplishment and pride that you could never get from the majority of mainstream AAA titles that hold your hand every step of the way. Despite the game's short length (5-7 stages, I can't remember the exact number), this game holds tremendous amounts of replay value for those who are willing to take it seriously: the inital challenge to beat original mode without continues could take a player any amount of hours from 10 to 100, and afterwards there's always the allure of a new high score, not to mention the other two modes.Bottom Line: if you like retro games like those for the NES, incredibly tough modern games like Dark Souls or I wanna be the guy, or if you just want a change from the other games on the market, give this game a shot: it's very rare for bullet hell games to be released outside of Japan, and this happens to be one of the best in recent memory.EDIT: I neglected to mention two other features: There is also a time attack mode where you're thrown into a unique stage with unlimited lives for three minutes to try and get a high score. Speaking of high scores, there are online leaderboards, and you have the ability to save replays of your playthroughs."

I actually read a few reviews before purchasing this game for myself and saw quite a few saying that Crimzon Clover is similar to the DoDonpachi games from Cave, and while I have never played Dodonpachi I have played some of the Cave shmups and have always found them quite fun and I honestly believe the people that compare this game with Cave developed games were spot on. It's a really fast-paced and visually stunning game with really awesome music which are really three things that every good shmup need at the very least, I also appreciate the fact that the controls themselves are very responsive and things such as enemy bullets standing out amongst all the crazy action (a feature I also noticed in Danmaku Unlimited 2, which I also recommend) make the game very fun to play rather than being just a generic shmup that often end up more difficult just because they're not very well defined.Also, I want to point out above all else that the Boost Mode is pretty amazing and makes this game at least twice as fun as it started at. I'm sure other games have similar mechanics, but it's the first time (at least in recent memory) I've seen a mode as interesting as Boost. Not only does it make the game 100% more explosive and hectic, it also gives you an additional challenge in trying to make sure you don't lose your Boost and go back to (temporarily) being a peashooter. Also, with the addition of the Type-Z (which requires progessive unlocking, which I honestly haven't completed yet but am working on), the game actually has additional replayability, which is a nice plus for a shmup.10/10 would danmaku again."

76561198040600970,Recommended,285440,26097511,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Vamphaery,"A review for those who are - like myself - new to true Bullet Hell gamesI've played my fair share of super hard games like most gamers who grew up in the 80s. But with that said, while I'm a veteran of the Gradius, Darius, and R-Type series, and I grew up with all the old staples like Xevious and 1942, I've never played what I would term a ""true"" bullet hell before. The closest I ever got was some of the old Raiden games in arcades back in the day.But by the time daijun games really started to take off in the West, I like many gamers had moved on from 2D and arcade to more immersive 3D fare. It's only been as I've aged that I'vebegun to desperately pine for the old ways. And as such, I've found myself this month on a  massive shmup kick.So if you're like I was, you might wonder what exactly this game is all about. What makes this game different than other shmups you may have played? What exactly is a bullet hell gameanyway? Are they just insanely hard? Do you need the reflexes of a Jedi Knight ninja on speed to stand any chance at all? What's it all about?The absolute basicsBullet hell games are essentially vertical or horizontal (vertical here) scrolling shmups with one defining characteristic that earns them the name: absolutely harrowing difficulty. You will have to be at your personal peak of hand eye coordination to play this sort of game as you meticulously maneuver through razor thin spaces amongst projectiles and lasers which at times fill the screen dizzyingly. This is not a game for the faint of heart. It's brutally difficult, and it's meant to be.These games also often lack weapon upgrades or other customization options, as is the casehere. Instead it's all about pure twitch gameplay and success against overwhelming odds through sheer skill. It really is a refreshingly ""pure"" form of gaming that goes back to the roots of the industry.You have two attacks in the game - your frontal laser, which by default fires forward in a wide spread, and a lock on/homing attack which you can hold until locked on to the maximum possible number of targets, or release sooner for quicker strikes. The longer you hold it, the more powerful the attack will be, and the higher the temporary score multiplier you'll receive for your laser shots for a while. While locked on, you move more slowly, and your frontal lasers condense into a tighter band of energy covering less of the screen. Maneuvering between projectiles while changing speeds and attacks in this way, and knowing which to use when, makes up the entirety of the challenge.As you defeat enemies, you earn stars (called stardust in-game,) and these contribute to yourscore, and your break rate. Your break rate is the speed at which your break meter fills. Oncefull, you may enter break mode, which intensifies and speeds up your attacks. If you double your break meter, once in break mode you may press the button a second time to enter double break, for even more damage.By deftly using this to rack up stardust and points when your multiplier is high, and not allowing your break rate to fall too low (it will drop to half of what it was during break mode roughly once you return to normal,) you can try to rack up your score by continually cutting through the most dense waves of enemies while in break or double break. If your break meter fills beyond a red demarcation line, but is not filled, you can also press the break button to clear the screen of most enemies and projectiles with a ""bomb"" attack. It's usually a panic button in practice when things get overwhelming, especially against bosses.You have three ships to choose from at the outset. One is slow but has a broad laser attack. The other is middle of the road in speed, and has a variable laser width. And the third is the fastest, but has the narrowest laser width. I personally find Type-III to be the most effective ship... other than the unlockable Type-Z.The game is only 5 stages long... but I haven't beaten it yet on Novice after 20 hours. :) It's glorious.Yes the game is hard... really hard. But you can still enjoy it.The beautiful thing about bullet hells is that they harken back to an era where gaming was still distilled to its barest fundamentals: pew pew. Shoot the things that move, don't get hit. You get hit, you die. It's a simple premise, but if you're never played a game like this before, it can be profoundly overwhelming prospect even for an extremely experienced gamer. But one of the equally great things about the arcade lineage of these titles is that they're all about scoring. As such, when you run out of lives, if you choose to continue your score is completely reset... but continue you can! This means if you're a complete beginner, you can still experiment with the game and try to get to grips with it by dying an unlimited number of times and still seeing all that it has to offer from a sheer content standpoint.Of course, in my opinion you'd be robbing yourself of the beauty of this sort of game. As I said, I've never played this sort of game before. The closest I ever got to something like this was the Raiden series in arcades. And it's in arcades that the ""kind of gamer"" I really am was forged. I was never a score chaser. I was always someone who loved to play the games, but was primarily in it to challenge myself... not other players. Some games (like Hang On) I was actually pretty decent at. But many I would be happy just to beat at all. I was always the kid who stood around and WATCHED the other more competitive players strut their stuff.It's taken until this era of Twitch for people to appreciate spectating games again but back in the day it was almost just as fun to watch someone trying to beat the local high score for hours, as it was to play yourself. Crimzon Clover is a fantastic game for that sort of experience. You can play Novice difficulty if you aren't great at bullet hell style games, and still get an INCREDIBLY stiff challenge. You can also play co-op with another player (local - no online... if only!) if you like, or just sit back and watch them play. It really does take me back to those childhood days in the arcade, just doing my best to get a little further...one more stage... one more boss... one more wave... one more high score.And it should be noted that I absolutely SUCK at this kind of game. But it's still an absolutely invigorating blast to play on Novice. Just hard enough to be brutal, without feeling like there's no hope! Trial and error; Improve. And if you're more skilled, then hop into Arcade Mode. Or if you think you're an absolute master of the genre? Take a crack at Unlimited Mode. There are also time attack modes, and Boost, which massively increases your score.Personally, I refuse to use the continues (but did use Type-Z ship ) Set your own goals for yourself! It's a great first timer's bullet hell, but fantastic for vets too.Old arcade look and feelYou know that hyper-grainy, yet imminently smoothly animated, high contrast, high color look arcade games used to have? This game, unlike some bullet hells, EXPLODES to life with that precise aesthetic. Even the narrow in-game window contributes to a sense of playing on a cabinet (and there's TATE, rotation, stretching, etc. if you want to.) Just gorgeous.Some issues do exist on the technical front. See this topic for details:http://steamcommunity.com/app/285440/discussions/0/348292787753336077/So who's it for?If you love straightforward, PURE gameplay driven shmups, and are in the mood for a BRUTALLY HARD game, but one of the best of its kind, give this game a try.Who should pass on it?Anyone looking for a long shooter with many more levels, & upgrades or customization. This game is repetitive challenge, not duration. A true arcade game."

I'd feel bad giving this game a negative review, but honestly I'm not hugely impressed either.The screen consists of 45% gold stars, 45% shiny numbers, and maybe 10% of bullets. For a bullet hell it's way too fast and chaotic, and for a shmup it's just incomprehensible. Sure, collecting gold stars and seeing huge numeric scores makes you think you're achieving something, but it's just an illusion. It's not to say the game is easy or poorly designed, but outside of it being flashy it's not really anything special. It's easy to get into, but difficult to master, yet falls on the casual side of things, especially if you consider the unlimited continues. Other than that the graphics are nice, the music is catchy, and three selectable fighters offer three different playstyles.Regardless, after beating the game a few times I've just had enough, and don't really feel encouraged to play again, despite there being several gameplay modes. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather play a shmup with tighter controls and more comprehensible visuals. So again, it's not that the game is bad, but for me it's just... meh..."

So when I got this on sale, boy was it worth buying. It was a great introduction to Bullet Hell SHMUPs for me and made me want more to try. The fast Action and Screen-to-screen bullets EVERYWHERE to avoid but I have managed to learn how to manuever out of the way. I haven't tried the harder modes in the game but I'm eager to do so (While slightly afraid that I'll meet my demise many many times hahaha.) The Soundtrack is also excellent to listento and fits the mood of facing your enemies and the bosses. I would love a sequel of this game or a similar one to it from this developer. 9.0 out of 10.0. GET THIS GAME."

You get 4 kinds of ships, one is unlockable, all ships only differ in shot width and movement speed. Basically this is some nice old fashioned arcade action. You fill your gauge up and get breaker and double breaker modes, doubling then trippling your fire power.When you activate that breaker mode, you unload on your enemies, they start exploding, the screen starts shaking, god damn it's a good feeling. You also have this other weapon, basically a missle system. You hold the button down, enemies around you get marked, then when you release the button, missiles get fired at them; while you hold this button down, you move a bit slower.Why do I not recomend this game though? Because of 2 flaws:1.) Your ship moves way too freaken fast, every ship has two speeds, fast as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and too fast. As you need to dodge a lot of bullets in this game, many of which slow moving, that means you need to move through some pretty tight spaces. Try doing that at top speed, you can't be precise enough to survive. The slowest speed your ship goes, is just too fast.2.) The slow down button is also an attack button. So when you hold down the missle button, you move slow, but when you release it to fire the missiles, you suddenly go super sonic speed. And since your holding then releasing the button often, you basically shift from moving ultra fast, to just fast. Try dodge bullets while doing this! In the later levels, there are some things that you need to kill as fast as possible, while dodging bullets. So that means holding and releasing the missle button, which makes to shift speeds. It is agonizing.Aside from that the game is just very generic, theres nothing really new in terms of weapons or level design. Despite that, it could still be fun if not for the above problems.I must say I do enjoy the game up to the end of level 2, but level 3 and beyond it becomes purely anoying."

Even if you're not into SHMUPS, it's well worth picking up.The original OST is amazing and matches the gameplay perfectly.You have access to a crazy amount of firepower - which gets even more ridiculous when you activate limit break.. and then double-limit break after that.  It's kind of like going Super Saiyan level 4.There's so much stuff on-screen at once.  Dozens of enemies, lasers filling the screen, explosions of score bonuses/bling .  The bullet patterns from enemies are just beautiful.  But at the same time it's not frustrating unlike other SHMUPS, since you have a lot of tools and firepower to make use of.   There's a built in system where doing more damage and chaining builds up your limit break meter, which can be used for bombs, temporary invincibility or Saiyan mode - it's dynamic and doesn't rely on drops from enemies. You can also get lives more frequently than other SHMUPs.9.5/10 Everything about the game is close to perfection."

The graphics are cute (many of the tanks look like firework tanks for example) and colorful and the enemies and levels are just about as creative as such arcade style games ever get. This game has several modes which vary in difficulty and 3 ship types to choose from giving it (for an arcade style shooter) excellent replayability. The game strikes a perfect balance, rarely ceasing to be a challenge but, thanks to the unlimited continues it gives you, never becoming frustrating.You can also save replays of your play-throughs to watch later.

It doesn't feel like it is an impossible task to most people like a lot of other secret bosses in bullet hell shooters do, but it does definitely take some skill and its not something a new player to the genre will achieve easily.

That, and Steam would replace the word with heart symbols.But why is this game, as you put it, ""FRICKIN' AMAZING""? Well, my friend, as per most modern day shmups go, this game is ridiculously fast paced, and on top of that, a vast amount of challenge and reward (in the form of big scores and shiny stars). Also, bullets and laser beams will be filling your screen around a good 90%-95% of the time in a playthrough.The game comes with four modes: Boost, Original, Unlimited, and Time Attack.Boost is a mode that adapts to your skill and playing style (but mostly the former), in a mode where you have unlimited Break Mode (there will be more on that later) once you get it activated. Truly a fun mode for those who are into earning big points, big stars, and firing gigantic, powerful lasers at a barrage of enemies.Original, as you may expect, is a mode that emulates the original Arcade release of the game on your computer within the comfort of your home (or in my case, all over the place, given the fact that I play on a laptop).Unlimited is essentially Original mode but with the difficulty pushed to the absolute limits. For those who can 1CC Mushihimesama Futari or reach the second run of DoDonPachi with ease, this is for you.Time Attack is a mode that asks you this question (not in the game, but in the case of me trying to explain this mode): ""How many enemies and how many points can you score in the time given?"" You have unlimited lives, but, as expected, you don't have unlimited time. If you ask me, it's one of my personal favorite modes in the game.All of the modes are fast paced and fun to play around with. I suggest tinkering around with each one and see if you can find your favorite.In addition to the four modes, there just so happen to be four ships to play as: Type-I, Type-II, Type-III, and Type-Z; the last one being an unlockable through playing the game and collecting medals associated with completing certain tasks in each mode; such as completing the first level without dying with each ship.One mechanic that definitely had me grinning was Break Mode; a mode where you can wreak havoc on many ships with a temporary damage upgrade to your ship by filling up the meter (that also acts as your bomb once it passes a red line) in its entirety. There is also a narrow bar under the bigger bar that you'll be focusing on, and this can play a major role in storing up a Double Break Mode opportunity. Double Break Mode is essentially Break Mode, but twice as powerful as regular Break Mode and the Break Mode timer is twice as long; and from there, the points start piling up at a rapid pace.If anything, all I can say is: BUY THIS GAME. And at the time of this writing (during the Steam Summer Sale), it's only $2.49; so there's no reason not to get it.Happy shooting down ships!...And insects....And tanks.YAY."

I haven't played very far, but a couple of bosses in Novice Mode, and got past the first boss in arcade mode. It's really relieving playing something like this from time to time.The game hasn't got any power-ups like other shoot'em ups (might change, I haven't got far), but instead has a fixed setup for each space-ship. You have main cannons, targeted weapons (hold down button 2 to target more and more targets) and bombs. You can also get into overdrive or ""break mode"" where filling the entire screen with your bullets.In novice mode, it's tricky, but not impossible to dodge bullets. And I beat the first level without dying on first try. But Arcade mode is a different story. I guess you have to learn the patterns and when to bomb to get out of deadlocks. Because I died a lot without any way to get out of it.Music, graphics and gameplay really reminds me of a real arcade shoot-em up. Would recommend this especially if you get it at a discount.

I love tons of bullets on screen, and I love the feel of weaving through them all, just in general. Solid music, seemed to have good tempo...But I just finally got my chance to poke through this game (no cc clearing, mind) and... This game is so good. I was giggling with glee as I played this through. The lock on mechanic gives you the normal focus slowdown along with a bigger arc of fire. Breaking feels so good, like shoving your ship into overdrive- until you mess up and while your screaming ""POWAAAAH!!!!"" your break shield drops, you get hit, and it gets cut off as quickly as you start it (nevermind the DOUBLE BREAK). Maybe it's just me, but this game requires some serious aggression to survive with a no CC (more then i may do.). Who knows if ill ever no CC this one.The different modes of the game change the script. Original is good enough, but adding Time Attack, Boost Mode (managing it), and then the BRUTAL Unlimited mode... combine it with the overall feel of flight (and speed) and some of the neat pass through effects (moving through some of the clouds in one of the levels.), and this has been an utter JOY to play.TLDR: Rended to shreds by the bullet fire, and enjoyed it to crazy degrees.

If you like fun, go buy this game RIGHT NOW.If the dazzling array of colors didn't already overload your senses, bear in mind that the scoring system in this game is ridiculously deep. I'm still finding places to optimize my scoring, and most of my scoring routes are based off of the routes that the top Japanese players have come up with (which explains my stage 1 score). Plus, it's so much fun to go into BREAK MODE and DOUBLE BREAK MODE for maximum destructive power. I've been playing this game since its original release at one of the Comikets back in the day (when it was called Crimzon Clover), and I still think it's so much fun. Yotsubane knows how to make games enjoyable.If you are looking for a deep, rewarding game that is tons of fun, pick this game up. Trust me, you'll get addicted to seeing your score explode from millions to billions to TRILLIONS OF POINTS in a matter of minutes while you tear through hordes of enemies and show the bosses what's up.Note: Please don't get discouraged if you can't pass the first level on novice boost or something like that in a few tries. This genre of games takes a LONG time to get really good at. (I still can't clear Arcade Original and I've put 100 hours into that mode alone, though I can consistently make it to stage 4/5 now.) The top rankers on Steam have been playing shooting games for years before they picked this game up.  That alone doesn't make this a bad game; its quite the opposite.

Almost all of the enemies and attacks are well choreographed with the appropriate lead in making the whole game feel ""fair"" and drastically reducing the number of insta-gibs on bullet spawn on the first playthrough.There's no real story or plot to speak of here and while the sound track does a good job setting the pace and mood of the game, it doesn't particularly stand out compared to other titles in the genre.  The artwork is great and there's plenty of juice to go around, but it may seem busy at times or come across a bit dull to those who are tired of sci-fi/spaceships.  Your profile won't get wrecked by achievements, the vast majority of which can be earned with persistence rather than skill.

For the keen eye Cave's two color shot and speeds with score system and hyper mode (aka Break Mode) , some layer locking and secondary shot slowdown, AND even Cho Ren Sha's ""trinity"" Power-up all says you're in for a good time. Seriously the amount of cues to the now staple systems for vertical games is very refreshing and respectful, one could keep this title as a reference for those who are just getting into or interested in the genre.Another note is that the whole package feels right, especially for the balanced use of freeware and in-house assets. The shot, ship, and swarm speeds are all there and on point. The different mode further tailor the experience to your battle mood. Simply solid delivery across the arcade board.About the only thing I'm holdong out for, if not hoping for is the incoming titles to have a ""sweet definiton"" - that one token mechanic that you notice that says iconic. Double Break mode is a close second, still leaves me wanting more.C. Clover as a whole has near iconic quality, yet for it to make its own would really shine.

Charge it twice and you'll get Double Break mode, an even more powerful version of break.Adopt various playstyles after shooting down enemy bosses, by looting the different power-ups released by them. Lock-on and unleash various types of damage upon the targeted enemy. The bosses are, in order of appearance:Titanix- A ground based mobile fortress defending the Armoured City,Hecatoncheir- A six-armed robot defending the canyon that leads to the secret cavern entrance to the base.Maelstrom- An extermination type base defense cannon protected by flower petal shaped armour, defending the exit of the cave the player entered from stage 2.Diabolos- A flying, modular mobile weapon  with a a fleet of small carriers, protecting the base from the sky.Gorgoneion- A massive computer like device constantly absorbing data of unknown content and building new weapons to protect itself.Crimson Heart- The true final boss, unlocked after clearing through Gorgoneion without using continues. Little is known about it, except that it resembles the default sprite of Type Z, adding to the mystery of why it would appear after Gorgoneion appears and the player has apparently stopped a kind of apocalyptic event, as hinted at in the text that which appears before Gorgoneion.Collect star points to unlock extra credits and the Type Z shot. Use three shot types. Type I, which is available from the start, and has a slow speed, but higher damage, Type II, which has a ""rolling"" style of shot and higher speed, and Type Z (has a sprite identical to the Crimson Heart boss), which has a very wide and very high damaging shot. Hold lock-on while selecting it and the sprite will change to a re-coloured Type A, causing further mystery by sharing design with the Crimson Heart.Play three separate game modes. The first is original mode, which uses the standard gameplay mechanics, with no modifications to the basic break, bomb, and life system. The second is simple mode, which works with a rank system. Break cannot be activated, but is instead triggered by filling the gauge all the way up. Fill the break gauge to also increase bullet speed in three intervals (0%-49%, 50%-99%, and 100%) and game difficulty as power increases. Shoot enemies at point blank in full break to cause massive star points to appear. Finally, unlimited mode, which is identical to original except performing a shoot down with fully charged lock on will release a shower of star points and greatly increase the difficulty.These key features truly make Crimzon Clover outstanding. Its name is a reference to a species of clover native to Europe. An indie bullet hell game developed by Yotsubane.

The game's highly-varied difficulty is a product of precise positioning and mechanical knowledge in equal measure; each mode offers its own twist on the formula.The presentational complexity of some core mechanics is rendered moot by intuitive design and a stage replay feature of fighting game-level customization. Learning the game is a joy and a thrill, and a nearly universal control scheme helps speed things along, though usage of a joystick is highly recommended for later bosses, which should hardly deter long-time genre admirers.That aside, it would be remiss to neglect the catchy tunes and splendid bullet patterns on display here. There is not a trace of laziness in the boss and enemy design, and this extends to the retro art-style proudly wearing the arcade banner in a sizzling provocation to more modern visual cues.The usage of color and contrast is subtle yet pronounced, and there is never a moment where projectiles will be positioned unclearly or blindingly - perhaps mundane, yet crucial, as the varying environments are highlighted well thanks to good placement choices. As far as game design goes, the pace never falters, and neither does the challenge.While never being awe-inspiring as such, anyone fancying electronic melodies will not be disappointed by the melodies showcased.All in all, Crimzon Clover: World Ignition is an unfortunately titled yet stylistically endowed shmup, a rare breed in a very niche, even endangered, genre. Even if you are not normally a fan of such products, I would recommend picking it up to test your skills and have a good time doing so.Rating: B+A good way to spend some time with no major faults to speak of and good, endearing production."

The graphics and music convey absolute intensity- it really nails the ideal genre aesthetic. CC also gave me a ridiculous gaming high (while beating the extra boss with no lives left)- I felt my body and visual field pulsing through the game / music and time distorted. Any game that can get me there is +++++CC is worth it at full price, and if it's on sale... you know what to do"

,Recommended,285440,22570763,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,Selene,"One of the best shmups on Steam. Crimzon Clover offers a fairly CAVE-like experience, but stands alone enough for those that want something a little bit different from a real CAVE game. The break mechanic is interesting and will give you plenty of game time figuring out just the right time to use it. There are plenty of different modes on offer, including Boost mode (Variable Difficulty), the original Arcade mode, the obligatory super hard Unlimited mode, and a seperate Time Attack mode for you scorechasers out there. If you've never played a bullet hell game and want to see if the genre is for you, Crimzon Clover is a great starting point.The DLC is largely skippable, but I found the Superplay DLC to be quite useful in helping improving my scores. It is a very niche product, however. The real value comes from the included commentary from the players, rather than the replays themselves."

Badump tsh.Very much a modern arcade shmup. It'll eat your quarters until you earn the skill required to 1cc.Edit: ONE Downside is the high ranking player replays locked behind a DLC paywall. Not necessary for me, but videos of high level play ought to be easy enough to come by that it's odd to see it as DLC."

But through shooting you are given choice to either temporarily power up your ship, or to destroy all the projectiles on screen. And this works very well. Music can be great, has a low-fi feel to it. Graphicly it's not that impressive, but game's still looking good and overall art does the job. The expirience of playing this is very trance-like, very meditative. No reason to not check this game out."

The music is awesome and I can't help but laugh at how absurd the bullet storms coming at you are. The hit box is tiny so you can get out of some TIGHT spots if you really conentrate. I have no idea how a human can beat this game without spamming continues though. You have to be on another level at these games I think to really defeat this beast.
