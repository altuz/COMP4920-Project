If you're still having some old hardware piece with Win XP onboard, game's a good one, and almost unique, by the game setting. But... now it's obsolete.2016 review: Real-time strategy title with the rare setting of the Grand War. RTS where you need to collect resources (like wood, oil etc.), build towns and watchtowers around them, scout the map, and only after that spawn a massive attack on the enemy base. Just like it was in the RTS by the time of ""Warcraft 2"" and ""Dune: the battle for Arrakis"". In the setting of 1st World War, with  planes, warships and so on...But it was released about 15 years ago. Which means the game is dated quite badly, like the most of the RTS of that age. Many of modern PC users will not be able to start the game properly. That you can easily see from all the lot of negative reviews on the ""Entante"" just here on the store page.So, why, of all things, I'm still recommending the game? You see, there are maybe less than five strategical games for that time of history. And all of them but stunningly weak ""Battle of Empires"", are quite old. Well, don't get me started on the ""Battle of Empires"", just check the reviews on it for yourself!The mark is 6/10. Could have been higher, would the game was ready to play out of the box, but now, alas, you really need to start from tuning part...And that will bring you nowhere with the modern PC with Win 10 installed and updated. Alas."

Widescreen support doesn't exist, but that's really not that much of a surprise. Multiplayer seems to be down, it was powered by GameSpy if I recall correctly, so it's not a surprise, I guess.For those who have issues - install directx version suggested in forums, use compability mode and don't forget it's a game from era that is kinda hard to play on modern PCs without tweaking, as developer can't really give you a DOS BOX and just emulate old hardware.Gameplay wise it's a great strategy surviving the trial of time well, especially when there are not that many WW1 strategies out here at all.

,Not Recommended,285480,17662249,"Posted: 22 August, 2015",all,Foxysen,"The Entente is a old-styled RTS based on rarely-used WW1 setting. It was released in 2003-2004 and was made by same people who made Cossacks, on same engine as well, unless I am mistaken. And now it was rereleased on Steam.You will notice that while in Steam it's called Entente Gold, in the game itself it shows ""v2.0"" and intro was edited to say ""Entente II"". It's not clear what was changed. I remember somebody on Steam noticing it and saying that some sprites were changed. Like they were working to remake it, but then gave up.And sadly, it wasn't changed enough to be made compitable with newest Windows. While it may work fine on Windows XP, anything newer will have bucket and half of troubles, bugs and glitches. Then again, you aren't likely to progress past ""frozen mouse"" anyway. So you will have to look around Steam forums and guides a lot to fix it all. To try to fix it all. Having ended up using Voodoo emulating software of sorts, I still would have low FPS in this game. Well, it was fine, but only when nothing was selected. And you have to select buildings to order 50 more soldiers, you know. And some people seemed to fail to make it run properly even after trying all solutions. So, be careful. This is the main reason not to recommend the game.Oh, yes, no Widescreen. You can set it, but it will just will crash the game.No idea how mutliplayer is in this game. Actually, when I clicked on multiplayer option, it was showing nothing aside from mirror-effect. You know, when screen places frame on top of each other when there is no background. Leaving only trail of mouse. It could be because I didn't fix it fully. Or it could be because v2.0 changed things or possibly deleted everything related to multiplayer, including menues.I didn't play much of game because of it lagging on my laptop after fixes. Just few random map battles. It's quite a standard old-school RTS. Even WW1 setting doesn't bring much to it, no trenches to be found there. Having few recources types may be scary, but you just put needed buildings on top of nearby recource pools and then send remaining workers to work near windmill. And well, being 2D engine in beggining of 2000s, it means that it sacrificed 3D looks for sake of having tons of units at same time. And it's spammy, alright.One of the more interesting things in it is how your main force, soldiers, are mass produced. In masses. Quickly and cheaply, filling your screen up. But they die like a fly when met with any defencive. While power and recources and time needed to produce better units grow geometrically, so to say. You can make basic soldier every few seconds. Or take half-minute to produce machine gunner. Or few minutes to produce artilerry cannon. Which hits good but misses 90% of time, so it's better used on center of a town. And has firing range bigger than vision range. Doesn't stop unit AI from shooting. Or you can take 20 minutes to create a tank. And the most powerful units are naval ones, taking no less than half-hour or more to complete. Hm, perhaps it's realistical, seeing how history makes a big deal when a ship is lost. It does make water maps take forever when you need a water transport.But then again, looking at players on YouTube and looking at AI, mass-produced soldiers are still the thing to do. Sure, a soldiers die like a fly when met with guard house filled with machine gunner. What it means is that you have to create 10 times more soldiers and zerg rush it down, watching them grenade everything. It's also faster than producing heavier units.And seeing how multiplayer does not exist here, AI isn't all that great either. No, it's hard. Until you figure out the game. It's just that his main tactic is massing soldiers are and sending waves after waves at you. It could use more variety, really.Well, it's quite a curious old-school RTS. Or mass producment of basic units while wasting 30 minutes to build something bigger. I didn't spend enough time to say for sure if it's bad or good one. But seeing how it may or may not run even after fixes, you should avoid it."

Others have issues like the game not even running, and while I normally take those kinds of complaints with a grain of salt, reading through the forum shows this game is rarely a simple install and play with everything working as expected.If you're the patient type who doesn't mind doing some work arounds to get things operating as intended, and you like an Age of Empires type game, then give it a shot.

I played this a lot a few years back, and the entire Great War setting is something i feel needs more games. Not to the extent of World War 2, mind you. So graphicly, its old. From the same vein as  Cossacks and American Conquest (Both games sit in my game pile, proudly i might add) There is problems with it running on modern machines. I am currently running it on Vista, aside from a few annoyances the game runs fine. Even though the game is said to work on XP (and older) and 7. If you like games such as Cossacks (Cossacks two lovers, sorry its more like Cossack one) or American Conquest. Put some money down and play one of the finest World War 1 strategy games."

I loved this Entente when I was younger and loved playing it, one of the few World War 1 RTS games out there. The problem I have is this game uses FPS to judge game speed. If you want to run slowly you're going to have 12-18 frames per second. Not to mention the GUI. When up on your screen it halves the already poor frame rate.  It goes up to 35 frames if you turn the speed all the way up but then if you select a unit the menu appears and halves your framerate again.The colours are disorientating and can making you feel sick after a good hour or so. The resolution is screwy at best. They are weird to begin with, I'm not sure but I think they're for 4:3 monitors. I'm going to say don't get it if you've just stumbled upon it and thought it seemed interesting.If they just made a HD version that got rid of the resolution and framerate problems I would reccommend this game like crazy."

The interface is fairly simple as are the graphics, but the visuals maintain the game's historic accuracy (the differences between national uniform). It can't be compared to the ""Blitzkrieg"" series for graphics, and it's somewhat behind the ""Battle of Empires"" mod for ""Company of Heroes"", but for the price there's quite literally hours (if not weeks or even months in the campaigns) of game play with thankfully little frustration for the junior leader or even the veteran RTS player. A well-trained AI is built into the game to manage your civil or military war effort for you so you need do very little, unless you really want a challenge. Then you should fully expect General War in all his aspects! Finally and thankfully the game doesn't just park itself in trench warfare-you should expect what really happened in 1914; the dawn of twentieth-century warfare with all the associated horrors. Good luck, everyone."
