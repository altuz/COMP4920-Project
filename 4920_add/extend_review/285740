76561198042261571,Recommended,285740,15632571,"Posted: 30 April, 2015",all,Jamie,"This game is like eating three pints of ice cream while watching your favorite movie. You have this sinking feeling that something or someone may judge you, but you know what? It tastes good and it just FEELS SO RIGHT.This is a very well thought out dating sim game and I'm happy to still be waist deep within it. Your task is to help your boss, Kitty Powers, make perfect matches. Send your clients off on their dream dates and make sure they don't blow it.Simple enough, right? Not quite. There are types of people to mix and match together while hoping that date goes perfectly. Will it take one perfect date or do you want to steam it out with three dates? Guide your clients by playing mini games to make sure they succeed in winning the affections of their date.If you succeed, you get promotions and you get paid. Getting paid means better restaurants to take dates to, better ways to fancy up your clients (because they REALLY need your help), and other little perks like kicking out the more troublesome clients.The tutorial makes things look incredibly easy, but once that's done, you are almost completely on your own and left figuring out things for yourself. You'll have to understand clients interests and how your little black book works. You'll either figure this out through dumb luck or failing. Either way, there's no harm in making a few mistakes at first. No one's perfect starting out. Even I have a completely ruined relationship from a client that I thought were totally into each other. Oh well, win some and lose some.I love that you get updates from satisfied customers and you get perks from their continuing relationships. I thought that this was a great touch and another incentive to get things right the first time. Another thing that I loved? Making my own profile to send out myself to be a ""mystery shopper"" for my own dating life. Can't wait to see the results to have a good laugh over that.The graphics are bright and inviting, reminding me of traditional time management games. And those games? Those games remind me of addiction. They remind me of ""just one more level"". That's what I noticed immediately. I wanted one more date conquered just because I needed the ego boost. Just to say I was Kitty's best employee (I have no friends playing this so this is my wild imagination), I needed to do more work for more upgrades. Just ONE MORE client! It's very friendly and I'm almost happy that Kitty isn't cartoony because that would take away from the humor that is our wonderful and loving boss. She is quite sassy and pixels just wouldn't suit her, after all.I especially appreciated that there was a bit more inclusion in this game. It's not just limited to man-seeking-woman or woman-seeking-man, the devs did realize there's more than man and woman relationships so I must say I appreciated that option. Thank you. It means a lot that you did that.There is a bit of stereotyping...but more so on the personality types of ""sporty"", ""nerds"", ""hippies"", etc. If that offends you then I have no idea what to say. If you have trouble with characters who are supposed to be ""punk alternative"" speaking with what seems like (forgive if I read it in the wrong accent!) a Cockney/London accent then steer clear. Seriously. British Punks from London stereotypes. I can't imagine anyone hating that but hey, they're there amongst a few other cliches. I thought they were all incredibly adorable characters I really, desperately wanted to see happy. They're very ""human"" with wants and needs and the need to be validated.Even for cartoon people without souls, yes. I'm entirely serious.The more things you buy for your matchmaking business, the harder things get. If you buy better restaurants, you get paid more, but the games get harder and sometimes slightly lewd. Yes there is a game to hold in your fart. The fact I can write a review complimenting a game for recognizing that yes, you have to hold in your gas during a date and it is indeed a game of chance is astounding. I never thought I'd have to compliment a fart mini game.Buy a salon for your business and you can alter your appearance for a better potential mate for your client. Wouldn't that one guy or gal be great IF ONLY your client dyed their hair lilac? Now you can...if you do it quickly. Does that guy/gal prefer a more chic style? Quickly change clothes after you buy an add-on for your salon. They say you shouldn't change for anyone but hey, let's make an exception, right?It's an easily accessible game that truly anyone can play. While I'd keep this for the crowd that can understand dating, I'd honestly say this is really a decent game for anyone to play. It's cute. It's bubbly. You can play against your friends and compare scores. You can even send your friends personas on dates if they're playing. You get bonus points for making matches with real life people and you'll tell who they are by the little globe by their profile as you match them up to people.I can't find a single thing bad about this game, really. It's a little tycoon/sim on dating and it really illustrates the whole luck/chance and repetition that is dating. And I'm not bored! There's always some new curve ball coming at me!Plus Kitty Powers is the best boss I have ever had. If I could just do this in real life with Kitty as my real boss, this would be great."

Plus, it's fun telling your client what to do on their date, such as LIE!!! :PYou get feedback from your clients after their dates.

Not only were they stubborn and had to go through three dates before they were finally happy with someone, but I then proceeded to play through three more people before I got a call asking where I was.Not only that, but it's really fun to see if you have updates from the couples you've paired up. I always get happy to see the letters informing me if they're still together or not, and a little sad if they're not. And I can see myself playing this game for a long time to come because I not only love working on the challenge that is pairing people up, but love the updates.I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you haven't."

You create a character, that is supposed to be ""You"". You choose your looks, your personality traits, your birthday which is also your star sign (Gemini, Aquarius, etc.) Your first date you set up you cannot mess up, as it's the tutorial that's running you through how to play.You choose your venue that you want to act as a matchmaker for. Each venue has different people's personalities. You do kinda feel like a third wheel on the dates, since you're just silently watching them. The goal is to pick up on verbal cues by the dates and give them the best experience. Make the right comments, order the right food based on the hints they give, etc. You can date other peoples character profiles as well.You get coins that are used as a currency to buy upgrades and other things to help you. The better you do, the more coins you are tipped at the end, the higher your reputation goes up, and the more you matchmaking you can do.All in all, it's a pretty interesting game and if you like the idea of setting people up on the perfect date, then it's worth a try.Humorous, non serious review:I am Lord Tippington, a balding, introverted, antisocial, nerd. I have hundreds of hours logged in ""The Sims"", have had many lovers, and as such I feel I am the most qualified to take the esteemed role as ""Matchmaker"".My first day begins now.I have chosen a comic book shop as my first matchmaking venue, I will help fellow nerds such as myself find love.My first individual is none other than m'lady ""Ambrosia Bunfoot"". I tip my Fedora at her. ""M'lady!"" I inquire, ""What doth bring  such an esteemed m'lady such as yourself to my humble abode?""She does not answer, save for the phrase ""DUNGEON MASTER.""Ah! But the esteemed m'lady is a dungeon master! How could I not have guessed by her beautiful bowl-cut-mullet which appears to be stained by the grease of hot pockets of the distant past?I brush my trenchcoat back and fall to one knee, and grip noble Ambrosia's hand with my cheeto stained fingers, ""M'lady, I, Lord Tippington, am an expert matchmaker and can find you the most noble of men!  Pray, tell me, what interested such a fine m'lady such as yourself?"" It is not long before she robotically belts out the words:""FPS GAMES.""""WIZARDY.""""ELVES.""""M'lady!

I begin tipping my fedora furiously in anticipation.M'lady is getting along really well with Sir Goldthwaite!They're... quite happy together. Happy. Together. My sausage-fingers clench into a fist and shake with jealousy.As I watch in the shadows I notice they order Cheese Cauliflower and a Cheese Board to feast upon. I would've chosen something more bacon oriented, but alas.The date winds down. They have agree'd to get more serious, settle down with a glass of fine champagne in a romantic hot tub, and partake in the age old tradition of making autistic kissing sounds at eachother. I watch from a distance, and stare at the happy couple I have created with ever-growing jealousy and tip my fedora repeatedly with rage.My next dear romantic is a M'lady by the name of Rita. Rita... is b-beautiful. I find myself at a loss for words upon her entry.

It looks awful.Being the fragile little butterfly Rita is, I inform her to lie to this insufferable fool of a ""sir"" that his hair looks good. Alas, she is timid and her speechcraft is lax.

The gameplay is casual gaming at its best, with a bunch of minigames, some simple, others a bit more complicated but all of them fun (except for one, the pachinko game, which is basically a lottery). Playing a date or two is a good filler between longer games, but it's also fun to sink a whole evening into the virtual dating agency.It's a very charming game, fronted by the lovely Kitty Powers herself and full of nice jokes that are so bad that they flip over and become good.What I like the most, though, and what sets it apart from other dating sims I've played, is the way the developers seem to have thought about what dating is and what makes for a good relationship. The dates are all about paying attention to the prospective partner and trying to find common ground. Not only do you get points for pairing off your customers, but you will also get letters with updates on how the relationship worked out in the long run. This means that even though you can speed through a date, hide your weaknesses and pull a few ""white lies"", you will need to be honest and find really good matches to get those A+ results (necessary for getting the baby achievement).All this adds up to a fun, charming and well-designed game which I recommend with all of my heart!"

The evening started horribly, Liberty having selected all-American fine dining at its best with real authentic truck-stop flavours. Except Greg, her date, wants some fancy red meat dish with milk and the only thing on the menu is corndogs and french fries. Liberty suffered through Greg's talks of UFO's and internet meme's, eventually realizing through dull conversation that he shared none of her interests such as celebrity gossip or clowns. At the end of the date, Liberty thought she'd give it one more shot by asking Greg out for a second date. Greg is fairly unimpressed at this point and wants Liberty to beg for a second date.

It's super silly, quirky and loads of fun.You guide your client through their date and tell them what to do, what not to do, and there are some mini games that arise to add an element of panic and surprise. For instance, whether you can stifle a fart or or lie convincingly to your game. You can even spruce them up before their date to make them more appealing to whoever you paired them up with. It's campy galore and who wouldn't want to run a dating agency with an amazing drag queen diva?It is definitely geared toward a British audience. As an American with limited British language knowledge, I sometimes have to pause the game to look up what they are saying in the Brittania Urban Dictionary but that just adds to the fun! Also, while we are on the topic of linguinstics, some of the meals in the resterants I've never even heard of! But a quick search on the internet proves that they are in fact real and some look super tasty.Anyway, this game is playable forever and now I can watch other people fall in love or get dumped so I don't have to."

It's entertaining fun that has made me laugh out loud so many times, and I can't remember the last time a game did that. The titular (oo-er) Kitty Powers is probably the greatest part of its appeal, with her strong personality and hilarious quips. The characters are so funny and cute, the mini-games are incredibly fun, and overall the whole thing is just so amusing. It's fun to play, and that is the most important thing in a game.It's also a well-made game and works solidly. It has all the options (and more, really) that would be expected from a modern game relating to display, audio, and so forth. The whole package (oh MY) truly is an appealing one, making the experience a pleasure. Play for a few minutes and take a break from the hustle and bustle of the day, or play for a few hours and go on a matchmaking marathon!I find it especially laudable that both Kitty and the developers have stood behind the game and continue to promote it, to encourage videos, and have even made appearances for the game. They have continued to update the game, and overall they have been exactly the kind of developer everyone loves. It's clear a huge amount of love and care went into this game, and I'm glad to see more people discovering and enjoying it.Even if you aren't sure if this might be your kind of game, I still suggest giving it a try. It's a lot more fun than most games in this genre can manage. It's funny, cute, sweet, and really enchanting. It pulls you in and has so many things to unlock and discover, there is so much play value to it. At its regular price it's a steal for all it has to offer, but at a sale price, I have to say you should get it immediately.Great game, great fun, and far more entertaining than plenty of the games I've played with a higher profile. Kitty Powers will put a smile on your face and maybe inspire you to do some matchmaking of your own! Or maybe just to play one more date on the game...just one more!"

This game is completely unique to anything I've ever played before, and it combines so many elements!  Let's start with clientele!  First you choose a location (disco, gym, comic book store, ect.) for Kitty to set up fliers to attract customers.  The locations you pick determine the type of clients that arrive; for example, choosing the comic book store will bring in the ""Geeky"" types.  Each client is different, varying in looks, personality, and interests.  Because of the uniqueness of each character, it can be hard finding the right match for your client, but that's what makes it so much fun!  Will your client swing a home-run of strike out on their date(s)?The actual dates are the most intricate part of the entire game.   Literally everything has a part in determining the success of the date, from choosing a restaurant to holding in your farts!  There are fun mini-games to be played that vary with each establishment you go to.  Leveling up unlocks new restaurants for clients to visit and different features in the salon to beautify your client before the big date!There is quite a lot of memorization involved in the game, so it can get tough once you reach the higher scoring dates, but I don't believe it distracts from the overall entertainment of the game.My favorite thing about the game is the mailbox feature.  After successfully setting up your client with a hot date, you will receive mail from he or she updating you on how things are progressing in their new relationship.  Sometimes things go sour and the couple breaks up, but sometimes they'll end up with children and even name one of the babies after you!  It all comes down to how well you do when playing matchmaker."

Dating sims such as this are a serious guilty pleasure of mine, so this game is right up my ally.  This one is a little different, however, because rather than going on dates yourself, you pair up other lonely hearts and send them on dates in an attempt to help them find their soulmate.  It's set up in a game show-type fashion, where you watch your client and their date through secret cameras and tell them what to say to their date in an attempt to impress them.  If you can't impress them, however, you will lose reputation points and undoubtedly hold your head in shame.  One negative thing that I must bring attention to is that this game gets stupid hard later on.  It may just be the fact that my skillz just aren't mad enough, but I'm a little too dense to figure out the date's type based on their interests, which is something you must know for maxium chances of success.  It would be nice if you could see their type along with the rest of their info.  Another thing that I'm not so keen on is the randomness of the mini games which can get pretty frustrating.  Sure, you can cheat, but only if you have enough coins.  But I suppose the random aspect is all part of the fun, kinda like Mario Party.  Overall, this is a fun, simple game that I must admit is pretty addicting, even if it is a little difficult.  It doesn't take itself seriously at all, which I something I value in life as well as games, so if you think this is the sort of game you would be interested in, I'd definitely give it a shot."

You get more choices with career promotions from Kitty Powers.  Kitty Powers is cooky fun - Prunk like her style!  Game start with a few restaurants to take date on, then you can buy more restaurants which open more fun mini games.If you believe (Prunk does not) that a person need change to make other person happy, you can buy salon things to change client's hair color, face accessories and so on.

As the levels progress theres more and more to remember about your potential dates, as well as a little luck, just like actual dating!The host character is also just hillarious.  Quite the Dame Edna type.  I'm not sure if that was the intent of the game, but it worked wonderfully.  She's a fun mentor as you progress through the game and is never lacking a funny quip or two.All in all, I found the game challenging for a dating sim, refreshing in the fact its not another anime dating sim, and all in all just a lot of fun.

This is Kitty Powers's Matchmaking and believe me, it's harder than you think.The one thing that it has in common with other dating/matchmaking games is the ... well, dating and matchmaking. But how you go about it and that fact that you will have all possible couple combinations (which is amazlingly refreshing for once) is different ... and can be quite difficult.There is some guess work and some unexplained features that can make this a little more difficult - for example who is what 'type'. No, not sexuality wise but life style wise. How do you best figure that out. Then you start having to guess some more and make conclusions until you finally realize that someone who loves Halloween might just like someone who enjoys costume parties.It's not black and white - it is not match the same with the same but it is a but find the middle ground.The rest of the set up dates are won or lost with a serious of mini-games and a good memory or the ability to right things down fast. Some are a lot of fun, some not so much  - and some are simply depending on luck.Depending on your matchmaking skills, memory and luck, the couple will hit it off or not.Coins, XP and reputation are awareded. XP unlocks additional features via level - Coins are required to buy the features, cheat or get hints - and Reputation ... well I only know that the tip you receive for a sucessful case increases with reputation ... but that's all I know.For now, the game does get slightly repetitive but I am hoping to unlock some additional features to spice things up with time. Kitty Power's comments, the ... unusual ways of talking, crazy hobbies and the likes are currently still making up for it.One thing that I am really missing is the means to reset the account.

The Kitty Powers character - while I don't personally like her - is very reminiscent of the Lily Savage style character, a fun but fabulous drag queen who rocks it.The gameplay itself has you setting up clients with potential dates and trying to make the right matches for them based on personality type and more. It gets pretty nuanced which is pretty cool.But that's not all, you're also a fly on the wall in each date, the client has an earpiece through which you tell them what to say. You have to work out what the date wants to eat from clues like ""I want something cold with no meat. And no wheat."" You play a slot machine for conversation topics. You'll have to choose whether to lie or tell the truth on some of your answers, whether you think the date will be pleased or not. If you lie, you spin the 'Wheel of Misfortune' to see if you got away with it or not, with the chance of winning bonus coins. The coins you use in the shop to unlock add-ons to the salon where you can do your client up before their date, unlock more pages of potential dates, and unlock more retaurants. Each restaurant unlock adds in a new ""thing"" in to a date. For example, one restaurant unlock throws in the chance for your client's ex to randomly show up and you have to decide whether to be honest about who it was or lie. The date will either care greatly, or not. If you lie, you get the Wheel of Misfortune and if they don't believe you, as before, it's a strike. You get 3 strikes in a date. If you get 3, they walk out. Oh and if your client gets dumped they get a broken heart. If they are dumped 3 times, they storm out and you lose a bunch of reputation.TL;DR - It's a very pink, camp game with a really fun centre and I'm bloody addicted. But prepare for a British culture slap in the face.. I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to ""go for a cheeky Nandos for a bit of bants."""

From the screenshots, one might assume it's another iOS port onto the PC, but this game actually goes way beyond what we've come to expect from iOS games.  Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is about your own custom character's adventures being Kitty Powers' matchmaker and pairing up individuals you think might make nice couples.  Sometimes things go exactly how you think it will, and sometimes it takes a bit of prodding to get them to love eachother.  Sometimes you will taste the taste of total failure, sometimes total success.  Dates can go either way in this game with the dates getting progressively harder as the player unlocks more things, such as resturants, salon stylists, and more.  I highly reccommend this game to someone who is looking to fill the void that games like Cook, Serve, Delicious! left after completion."
,Recommended,285740,15820618,"Posted: 13 May, 2015",all,FluffySama,"I have fallen in love and it's all thanks to Kitty Powers!More seriously, this game is incredibly fun and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a casual game that'll steal hours, and hearts, from them.Story:You're a matchmaker. Make some matches. Try to make REALLY GOOD matches too so that you can make some extra money and make better matches.Gameplay:Simple but effective, each ""round"" you play is a date for one of your clients. At any date any given ""event"" might happen, triggering a mini-game; the amount of mini-games it draws from depends on your progression and how many different restaurants you get. The games are fun (if occasionally frustrating!) and don't really get old. Examples: card matching, higher or lower, plinko, spot the difference, etc.It's not surprising to me that this is also a mobile game; however it doesn't necessarily feel like a mobile game ported to the PC, if that makes sense, and I would definitely rather play it on a PC than my phone or a tablet. I do wish there were some integration of the keyboard for mini-games though.Overall my biggest worry about gameplay is always whether or not it detracts from or serves the story. As it's not a story-heavy game, and as the gameplay is quick and casual, I'd say it hits the mark perfectly. Low investment in skill or cognition for an inversely high amount of pleasure.Art and Writing:The art is campy, randomly generated, and absolutely perfect for what the game is. My one complaint here is that ALL of the characters are super thin and cisgender/gender normative? But diversity in appearance, race, and sexuality make for a fun enough romp that I forget that while playing. Kitty Powers herself is absolutely adorable while jumping off the screen, and while I think she's a tongue-in-cheek joke herself (she is a drag queen), the game has so far managed that without dipping into transmisogyny (I'm only level 9 though). The characters are incredibly repetitive, but the combinations of what they say change each time and the new combinations are almost always very funny.Sound and Music:The voice-actor for Kitty Powers is awesome. The character really comes alive even though she completely lacks animation. The rest of the sound? Eh. The music is loud, even when put down all the way to 1 and mostly it just annoys me. That's not terribly surprising, though; I rarely prefer to play games with their music (I like to turn on netflix or similar while playing). Sound effects and character ""chatter"" (they're not really speaking English) are very nicely done, though."

Instead of going on dates yourself, you guide your clients through their date with the girl/guy you think is right for them. You can also choose which restaurant they go to. The restaurants have 3 levels; easy, medium, and hard. You can also change the way your client looks before your date.If you succeed, they get together. Afterwards, depending on how you acted on the date, they'll break up. They can also get married and have kids if you did well on the date.If you fail (AKA get dumped), you have to try again with another person. If you fail 3 times in a row, they'll leave the agency, and your reputation will drop.Sometimes, you'll get stuck in the middle, and have to go on three dates before you succeed (or fail)."

You get to create your own character, personality and looks. And surprisingly, it's pretty realistic.You are a matchmaker at an Kitty Powers' agency, hoping to find love to all. You seat your first client, and Kitty shows you the right match. You can't lose the first date, for Kitty shows you all the right answers. But from then on, you're on your own. As you buy new restaurants, level up, gain reputation and new types, you also gain new challenges to face on your dates. Your client's ex can pop out of nowhere, you can have massive bowel problems in the middle of dinner, or you could fail to remember a story and disappoint your client's date. Remember exactly what your client's date looks like, 'cause they might just change their look and you're left to tell them what they changed!All I can say is.. good luck, and try not to get walked out on."

Everyone just loves Kitty Powers, who won't? She is the QUEEN!2. Each and every one of the clients who step into the agency is just a unique human being as any real human being are. It is just like a real-life online match-making service and that is the main key why this game is so much fun! You won't and will probably never meet the same client, EVER!3. Surprises and surprises! Honestly, the best part of the game, at least to my opinion, is the moment you receive letters from the pairings whom you succeeded in pairing. The letters are fairly mysterious and I LOVE it. Whether the pairings go happily ever after or the relationship didn't work out is 50/50 which makes me absolutely amused."

It's fun, but then it sort of becomes pointless after you matchmade Kitty, which does take a while to get there, but it just just sort of starts you over from the beginning, just with all of your restaurants and salons and such.

I know!Kitty Powers' Match Maker is a game where you work at this match making agency that allows you to force your client to date a random stranger, and you get to decide whether you want to help them fall in love or completely screw them over. Take your client and their date to the restaurant of your choosing as you do things like:-Deciding what to force the couple to eat-Engage in conversations that will reveal how much of a hypocrite your client will have to be to impress their date-Give your client's date gifts that you'll regret giving them-Play mini games to help your client do things like holding in their farts, remember what the waiter looks like, and even give the chef complements that will insult themAll in all, Kitty Puppeteer's Marionette Manipulation is a fun dating simulator that I highly recommend."
