76561198010860571,Not Recommended,285800,15878557,"Posted: 17 May, 2015",all,dog not understand art,"Ah, Braveland. It's hard to know what to say about it. It is not a bad game. I'm tempted to call it good. But I'm not going to do that, and I wouldn't recommend it to people.At $4.99, Braveland seems reasonably priced. On sale, it might even sound like a steal. But you're going to get a few hours out of it, and there's nothing remarkable about those few hours.There's nothing really awful about Braveland. The graphics are slightly unnervingly Fisher Price, but they're effective and the backgrounds look nice. There are only a few songs, and they sound competent and appropriate. The interface is fine. The mechanics are... well, balanced and kind of standard for this kind of game.So what's the problem?There's not much depth to the battles, and there's not much to it besides battles. You pick up a modest variety of classes, and can bring up to five with you: archers, healers, knights, scouts, etc. Their roles are fairly obvious and they do them well enough. But you can really use whatever combination you want, and the gameplay won't change much at all.The story is... well, the dialog is spelled and formatted correctly and does tell a pretty straightforward story about soldiers, bandits, villagers and the like. No one really says anything very interesting, but the conversations are short and inoffensive. The most personality you get out of the game is that bandits are dime-a-dozen jerks, and your peasant friend is a bit of a coward. There's a hero, who doesn't actually fight, and annoys me a little to look at him strutting around the world map as though he's helping. Technically he provides stat bonuses to the rest of the team by leveling up, but he mostly just speaks for the team and collects power-ups.There's no real replay value to the campaign, but there's a Survival mode where you can play battle to battle, losing characters and buying new ones, and see how far you get. I played around with it a little, and it might add a bit of life to the game if you wind up loving it. So, there's a bit of hope for getting more play out of the game at least.I have played a lot of Flash games in my days, on sites like Newgrounds - RPGs, tower defense, strategy games, action, etc.. Braveland feels very much like one of those games. The look, the feel, the length, the design choices and the options the player is given. Indeed, I feel like I've played Bravelands many times already. Except usually, when I play this kind of game, it's free. Often, it's also got something more novel or fun about it.Normally, it's probably not good to get lost in the weeds talking about free vs. paid gaming in a review like this. I guess all I'm saying is, Bravelands is a dime a dozen kind of game that you see all over the internet, and even if it's got a bit of polish and isn't awful, it's hard for me to justify anyone spending their money on it. For a few dollars more, there are lots of really unique, memorable games on Steam.If you just want to blow through some clean and simple RPG battles for a few hours, you probably won't hate this game. If it looks like it might be really awesome, it's not. It's just not. Look at the other reviews. A lot of the positive reviews say that it's short, it's easy, there's not a lot to it, it would be good for kids, etc.. Hardly ringing endorsements. If this game were getting 1 to 10 ratings instead of Yes or No, I don't imagine they'd be all that high. Nobody really loves this game. Everyone just agrees it's okay. If you want an okay game, buy Bravelands."

Playing on normal, if you walk into something too hard and lose your entire army, you get to keep the army anyway and the poor men collect some gold for you to reinforce so you can try again.It's entertaining enough for €4, but not much more. I'd say buy it if you're bored, like this type of games and want something new. Not a must have in the game collection by any means."
,Recommended,285800,15170725,"Posted: 2 April, 2015",all,Nemesis,"Cool little turn-based strategy. Something like a mix of Heroes and a fairy tale.I enjoyed playing it, but unfortunately there are some minor problems.First of all, the game has absolutely no replay value. 5 hours is enough to beat the game on hard level of difficulty.After that you don't really need nor want to play it again.Secondly, there are limited amount of fights, so leveling system is really poorly made. Same with gold, you just can't farm and earn as much coins as you would like. For example, there is achievement to buy all skills for your units. I noticed that achievement just before the last fight with 500 gold on me. Last upgrade costs something like 1500 gold. So i had to sell one of my equipment to achieve it. Pretty stupid, isn't it?Another problem is with AI. Computer doesn't really know what strategy means. For example it does not protect ranged units and is trying to kill my healer first, even if it would last for ever.And well, there are not many units available unfortunately. Also absence of Dragons makes me sad :(Anyway, it is a cheerfull game which will give you fun. The price is not so high also, but i would suggest waiting for a promotion or get it in bundle."
,Not Recommended,285800,31679812,Posted: 11 May,all,Azghouls,"Hear ye, hear ye. Your land is in turmoil. Bandits rampaged your town and currently going on a raiding frenzy. You, a rag tag farmer decided to rise up to do away those bandits. So, your quest begins by searching the lands (in linear fashion), recruit your army and fight your adversaries in hexagonal combat battlefields all displayed in hand drawn yet beautiful art. So, what are you waiting for? Oh, this sounds familiar, way too familiar to your liking? You guessed right. Braveland, even though it looks gorgeous, doesn’t bring anything new to the turned based hexagonal combat system. Heck, even the plot is ho-hum to the max as the entire game is simply fighting one mob to the next until the game ends.It may sound I’m a little too harsh with this and yes, I am. There’s nothing really going for in this game other than the artwork. The game is a mobile phone port and that, in itself, is not too bad considering I have played ported mobile games that actually fared well (e.g. Galaxy on Fire 2 Full HD). What made it sub-standard is there’s very little that caught my attention wanting to see what’s next in store. It’s all a matter of fighting one battle to the next until the game ends. At least add an interesting plotline however that was not the case too. So, all you have left is the visuals and sounds. The visuals I have to admit are pretty to look at – all sugary with a cherry on top that doesn’t overstay its usefulness and the musical scores are brilliantly composed and well suited for this style of game.How the game plays out, you have a world map to explore aiming to recruit your armies to finish off those malicious bandits that destroyed your town. You cannot get lost in the world as the available path is drawn out for you so it’s a matter of following the leader (so to speak). During your adventures, you’ll get the opportunity to hire men-at-arms and even ‘stray’ off the beaten track to gain further enhancements for your army. But of course, everything will result in combat, not matter what. The only exception is when you locate a store to buy equipment and / or more cannon fodder. But to get to those places is guarded by mobs so you can say every damn movement equals to combat.How the combat plays out is displayed in a battlefield of sorts. Drawn in hexagonal shapes so your movement is governed by six directions. Your army stands on the left and right, the enemies. Both armies can be a mixture of critters, archers, warriors, golems and so on. However, the important factor is the number of solders stacked in that group. Basically, the higher the number, the deadlier they become. In a nutshell, it plays upon strength in numbers.Also, each combatant is governed by statistics to measure their qualities so this is where the minimal RPG elements comes in. The statistics ranges from armour to damage output to speed and so on. Granted the game does extremely well with its tooltips as you can view their stats anytime without too many clicks - simple yet effective. Also, each troop have a special ability to spice things up yet they require a cool down once activated. I actually smiled at one of the enemy’s special ability where the archer’s special ability is they occasionally miss. I wish there’s more silliness like this however it wasn’t the case.Another skill that’s capable to turn the tides of battle is the rage meter. What this does that every time your character gets hit, builds up rage. And once you accumulate a certain number of rage points can launch a rage spell like fire arrow or boost armour (to name a few). Take note that rage skills can only be found and not earned however they are worthwhile investments as it does not take up a movement point and heck, it’s a bonus as it’s governed by the number of hits your group takes.As far as tactics is concerned, the battlefield does have some ‘roadblocks’ that can assist you ‘bottlenecking’ the enemy (and vice versa). However, that tactic for me had marginal success as there’s normally a mob group that moves around this roadblock and attack your weak armoured soldiers, namely the archers / healers. There’s nothing wrong with that and I applaud this tactic. However, because I played the game on hard difficulty, I cannot say whether these happens at the lower difficulty levels.So, what I normally do before combat starts is to see if I can create a roadblock. After that, I analyse which enemy’s secondary skill will cause me grief and then once spotted, gang bang this group with all my troops. Next to see which group has a high soldier count as the game does plays upon strength in numbers. Dwindle their numbers down by using your archers / healers. Then mop up the rest. This thought pattern has won me a lot of battles and granted, there are some battles that comes down to just two, my warriors vs enemy archers, for instance. That was pretty cool as it went down to the wire.There were times that the landscape displayed groups of tough enemies as my next encounter that I need to defeat them however just couldn’t. Caused me a little concern as it could spell game over just because I couldn’t defeat any of them. Yeah, I can knock down the difficulty level however in doing so ruin a certain achievement. However, luck played its role and looking in hindsight, was also pretty cool. So, the troop balancing is pretty spot on in most parts – well I guess for my playing style at least. My style mainly consists of having heavily armoured soldiers and a good set of archers in the back as I found that the healers are a joke. Weak armoured, weak attacking spells and only have two healing spells per battle is a waste of troop space for me.To complete the game can take approximately five hours or so. For me on hard, it took me about six hours to complete. Also, because there’s no grinding to level up and earning extra gold, every combat counts. Because of this makes you think twice spending gold as there’s no way you will be swimming in it. That’s another bonus to this game however take note I’m basing this on hard so it could be different playing on the lower difficulty level.To those achievement hunters, there are twenty-one to accumulate and I managed to snag sixteen during my first run. Looking back on them now, you can snag all of them in a single playthrough as well. Also, because the game is linear, there’s no real reason to play it again. That’s fine in my eyes if the main campaign had a decent length and interesting (and not just having one hundred go fetch quests). I guess gameplay length is the bane of most mobile gaming in general so it would be nicer if the PC port has extra missions. But that requires more effort on the developer’s behalf and we all don’t want that to happen aye. In additional to this, there are five steam cards to collect and even though the cards are pictures from the game, they all quite nice to use as background wallpapers. Heck I using one right now.So, with all this negativity and a handful of positives as explained above, it would be hard pressed to recommend this game to anyone other than those who likes a quick bash waiting for the train to arrive (so to speak) or even want a taste for this style of ‘war gaming’ experience. Even the price tag of approximately USD $5 may be tempting (subject to exchange rates if you are not in the US) however I still believe there are better games out there even if your goal is to kill a bit of time.5 / 10"

The battles in that game are more satisfying and the story is more interesting.)It's an okay game. The reason I don't recommend it is because it's too short and too simplistic. It's a turn based tatical/strategy game that needs little to no tactics or strategy. If you have a strong team, you will win without problem. If you don't, good luck. It's too simplistic to apply any tactic or strategy.It's a casual game with an appealing art style that you might want to play when you are tired and not in a mood to play something that needs too much attention or energy."

The first thing I thought of when I played: This would make a nice introductory game for those wanting to get the feel of those TBS games like Age of Wonders, HoM, Kingss Bounty etc.. It is simple, yet keeps you going. The story is just for show, as there is no development. Controls, like the game play, are very linear. Music, although repetitive, is not annoying. Adds just the right amount of ambiance.   But sometimes simplicity is the key to a great game. And for $4 - it's a good addition to any startegy lovers library."

I'd say that's a plus for the pricetag.The game's battle system isn't very deep and it's clearly designed for casual players. Despite this, it manages to throw heavy (yet short-term) consequences for playing badly on hard mode. The game has a small element of resource management wherein the more efficient you play, the more money you get to keep. If for example you play terribly on hard mode, you'll end up earning less gold (you'll have to pay more to replenish your party). The battles are finite so you can see how this can affect you. Luckily there's a way to earn gold in case you mess up. Be warned though that the other method is pretty boring.I went in expecting a casual experience and that's exactly what I got. The only thing I can really complain about is that window mode was not part of the option menu.4/5. Not bad!"

Stripped of all city management, you basically just have the turn-based combat. Braveland takes this and adds a big, friendly smile on every creature.It presents you a cute, classic storyline: a happy farmer boy loses his family and farm to bandits and sets out on a bold journey for revenge, but it turns out there is something more sinister going on and the happy guy wants to deal with it. He travels around and beats up the bad guys who take the hits with permanent crooked smiles on their faces. At first the dialogue attemps some meme-based humour (arrow in the knee anyone?), but they are quickly discarded for cheerful, repetitive greetings and taunts.Travelling happens on a board with enemies, stores and events in each tile. It's linear, though you can (and should) check every branching road for bonus items, gold and experience points. Gold gets you more troops and items, experience gives small bonuses to creature stats and increases the cap on troops.While I only played the hard mode, combats are easy for a player familiar with turn-based strategy games. Combat AI does not offer surprises in neither good nor bad ways, so it's okay. There are only 7 different types of troops to buy and around the same number of different enemies with upgraded versions of the usual ones coming later into the game. Basically all of them also smile all the time.Why, I even lost one battle! Being vastly out-numbered, my troops collected their pocket money and gave it to me to hire more troops for another try. Happyland would have been a more appropriate name for the game.In conclusion, Braveland would probably be a nice introduction to turn-based strategy games for children or people not acquainted with the genre.

Fairly basic tactics and quite repetetive but it's fairly brief and it warranted getting to the end. There's a little scope for varying your army build, you basically get 15 points with each unit type being worth from 1 to 5, and there being 7 units to choose from once you've unlocked them all. Over the course of the game as you level up you can purchase extra forces, and basic items that improve your skills. Again this is very simplified and you may as well just buy the most expensive (i.e. best) stuff. I found the heaviest tank unit to be woefully underpowered compared to the crossbow unit, especially with the power up triple shot action that the crossbow guys have, and the tank is also very slow, and can be tricky to position to get the best from his power up skill of attacking all surrounding hexes.I'm pointing out what could be considered flaws here but I did enjoy playing it, and it was never intended to be a heavy thinking game anyway. The quick battles are neat and the constant stream of new stuff being just a few minutes away keeps you interested.

If you are looking for a solid challenge, you're simply not going to find it here.Edit: Since my last review, I decided to play it all the way through in all the different modes.  Hard mode wasn't much different than normal, but did offer a little more boosted enemy AI.  Failure still pays out.  Survivor mode was actually a fair challenge.  Unit death is real, and you have to buy units between battles.  This gets tricky, as they only offer specific units for sale between each battle.  This makes healers imperative, but also puts a huge target on their head.  The longer you last, the bigger bonus they will give you next time around.  Survivor mode also cuts out all role play, which speeds up the game drastically.  Even with survivor mode, the game simply isn't as tough as the Heroes of Might & Magic series, which I would recommend to those who found this game too easy."

The music is perfect but there is only 1 or 2 of them in loop. I played hard mode whole time at the begining it was really hard losing half my money to repair my armies but when you do upgrade your armies the game get easier and easier.The graphics are 2D but with cool colors.

The special skill each unit have should be used as quick as possible whenever the cooldown is finished, I see very little purpose holding onto them whenever they are back up.pretty simple game, so far I haven't encounter much difficulty. Hopefully it picks up...you do have to spend your gold wisely since there are no farm spots for gold. You get gold by defeating your enemy in fights and if you lose units during the fight some gold is automatically deducted to recover those units. So less casualty = more gold at the end of the battle.GOLD is the only resource that you can spend, so you either expand your unit's life by filling up whatever your capacity for each unit is or go for hero items that gives global benefits, you as the captain can only equip 4 items that have global benefits.The combat get's repetitive quickly...And you as the captain don't actually get to fight, you serve as a passive unit that gains experience so you can upgrade stats that affect your squad.TL;DR - TBH 5 dollars is a bit expensive for the amount of depth it provides..."

I just skip those lol. (2/10)Gameplay: Unlike the aspect of the story, the gameplay itself is enjoyable for a turn-based strategy game.  (8/10)1- Character Elements -@You can view each character's information which include: health, damage, defence , range of movement and number of turns. There is also a description of character abilities and what it's capable of (stunning/magic damage/healing etc)@Level System: You level up by getting exp (obviously) by defeating and winning enemies.@Main Character: You buy more units or upgrades with the coins you get, you can't upgrade your units and however, you cannot fight with your main character (you only fight with your 'squad' aka your units)2- Combat-The combat is fun and easy. You get tips in the start of the game to understand the basics, and then you will just get used to the combat and know what to do.There are some points however, where you will have to move forward and fight weaker enemies instead of trying to beat an overwhelming enemy squad because your squad is not strong enough (which makes the game challenging.)Gameplay Styles: (5/10)3 Difficulties (Set to Easy/Normal/Hard)Easy is too easy , Normal is challenging enough and Hard oh well, it's for those of you who want to hit your head in the computer in order to win each match even if you have for example 5 units and your enemies have 500.Enjoyment: the game is fun for a regular and basic turn based game, I recommend it (it's not have so manyhours of gameplay either so it's just for fun for your free time) - (4/5)Repeatable: Didn't finish the game yet, but it's one of those turn-based games which the difficulty is the only thing that will change your gameplay. (1.5/5)Frustration: Except for extremely unexpected challenging enemies (bosses with 300 health and 2 units of it) the game is fluent and you will feel like a god playing with your super talented squad. - (2/5)Boredom: You will play this game for few hours without breaks.

It's probably a good game for the casual mobile phone market, but this isn't going to test your tactical expertise, and it isn't going to win any prizes for the storyline.Braveland is essentially a story one man's 'roaring rampage of revenge' against the EVULZ empire that came and sacked his little village. And he does it by telling other people to fight for him! Clever clogs! So you pick up some villagers, some trackers and other generic units and just go from place to place fighting battles, where you smack the enemy and they smack you until one of you runs out of numbers to smack with.It is that simple. Even on hard, there is little challenge provided, seldom any mechanics to speak of, and most dialogue go the way of ""ooh look at that simpleton with an army behind him, let us strip him naked and sell his stuff for money"" followed up with ""No way guys, let's kill them all!"" and you slaughter them.

Survivor mode provides a more challenging battle environment than the campaign mode.

Yes, it is a watered-down version of 'Heroes of Might and Magic,"". . . but I really like Heroes of Might and Magic.  Certainly the mechanics are familiar to anyone who has played HoMM or Kings Bounty: you fight turn-based battles while continuously leveling up your General and moving your troops around.  It is faithful to HoMM-1 in that you have 4 stats on your General and those 4 stats also beef up your troops.  It is more like the original Kings Bounty (the one from around 1990, not the current series) in that you just move around one single General, stopping at taverns to replenish your troops.  You don't have to worry about conquering gold mines or garrisoning castles.  Think of this as a single scenario map, and decide for yourself it you want to try it.  It has a free Demo if you're not sure.  Personally I had a blast playing it, and I got many hours of playtime out of it.  And I still haven't tried it at the Hard difficulty.One note for those of you who hate bugs and crashes: this game ran perfectly on my very old system.  No crashes, no bugs, no problems at all.The only negative is the lack of replayability; once you've played through on each difficutly level, that's pretty much it.  But then again, if you're on Steam, you have at least a dozen games in your account that you've played once and forgotten about it and a half-dozen you haven't got to yet, so be honest with yourself if this is really a negative for you."

For the price, length, and style, it really is a fun little game.  I'm playing on a Mac, so there are a few glitches I encountered (don't know if this is true for other OSes), none of which were deal-breakers and a few other minor irritations:1) For some reason, out of the blue usually, you can't do anything-- move, click on anything, close the game. . .  Like the forums say, an easy fix is switching the game to beta.  Worked like a charm after that.2) Despite doing some things in-game (like the rain of fire, 100 troops), the achievements didn't unlock.3) The game ends rather abrubtly.  I suppose if I'd paid attention, I would have realized I was at the end.  I think part of that is because there really isn't a huge emphasis on the game's story or story development.4) I'm not sure if it was just me, but the battle for the sword in the stone seemed far more difficult than any other battle in the game.But, like I mentioned before, these really are just minor issues.

This is my first one!Braveland is a cartoony little game where you (mostly) travel a linear path of battles with the option to make a few adjustments and changes to your playthrough depending on choices you make for your ""squad"" and ""items"".  You have a few basic stats, (Attack, Physical Defense, Magic Defense, maybe one more?) and there are a half dozen different types of little ""squad"" members you have  that act as units for your battles which take place on a hex-grid in a turn based format.Braveland is an adorable little game, best suited for a quick few hours waiting at an airport or to let your son/daughter enjoy.  I would argue it's a good introduction to gaming for children, because it lacks the depth or complexity that can make most games like this frustrating.  Some see this as a reason not to recommend the game, and it could be, but it's also sometimes relaxing to do something completely mindless.I wouldn't recommend buying the game at full price, you should be able to catch it on sale for $1-$2, or in some kind of indie bundle.Have fun!"

I find that I just can't take them seriously. And Braveland falls comfortably into that category. - But that's okay. At $1.99 USD, I don't have to take it seriously. I was looking for something casual and cheap and it was both. It took me 3 hours to beat it on ""easy.""   It is vagely reminicent of Heroes of Might and Magic and of the King's Bounty series in that the Hero doesn't actually take part in the battles and the troops move around on hexes.  If you have played either (or probably even if you haven't) you will catch on quickly.The only things I didn't like were - 1- the Troop restriction that esentially forced you to keep peasants (called ""Farmers"") in your army throughout the game. But that turned out okay too. They aren't as worthless as in most games. And 2- the almost complete lack of re-playability. (Maybe in a couple years. I might try it again.)At this price, it was definately worth it. I'll watch for the others to go on sale too. (But I won't pay full price.)"
76561198030367984,Recommended,285800,12962515,"Posted: 15 November, 2014",all,ExaltedDuck,"Braveland is a simple, lightweight turn based strategy in the vein of Shining Force and Final Fantasy Tactics.  You play the role of the Commander of a small and motley crew of fighters seeking vengeance against an evil army that sacked your village.The player starts with a pitchfork-weilding peasant and an archer, and eventuall unlocks 3 more melee fighters, one more archer, and a healer.  The healer is also able to cast magic bolts at enemies at any range.  The player's character doesn't appear in the battle directly but is able to cast attack and status effect spells during battle.  The tactics are generally pretty simple.  The largest force a player may bring into combat is 5 members but because there is cap on the sum of ranks of player units, the later, there is a choice as to whether to bring a lot of fast/low armor units or a smaller number of slow/heavily armored units.  Despite its apparent simplicity, there is just enough depth to keep the game interesting through its campaign.  The campaign isn't terribly long, with a full playthrough on Normal difficulty taking about 4 hours.  Muc longer than this, and there would need to be more depth to keep the game interesting.The graphics are pleasant, with a hand-drawn motif thant is a bit more sophisticated than the retro-throwback style so many games employ these days.  The colors are bright, animations are smooth, and it is generally fairly clear what to expect from new units -- both friend and foe -- when you first enounter them.  The music is well produced and fits the game's art style to a T, with a somewhat medieval/fantasy feel and a nice mellow overworld theme and battle music that conveys tension but keeps with the smooth and relaxing feel of the rest of the game.Bottom Line:  That ""smooth and relaxing"" feel is this game's draw.  It is not a super deep prove-your-mettle-as-a-general battle/war sim.  It's deep enough to be a little engaging but not so involved as to be distressing.  It is a diversion for a few minutes or hours getting away from the hectic and stressful beat of real life or a soothing distraction to pass the time on a bus or in a waiting room where your undivided focus for several hours simply isn't available."

Damn, see my hours on record? It's the time it took me to finish the whole thing without skipping any dialogue or side-battles, and I also played several times on the other ""arcade battle"" game mode,  which doesn't have much to offer either.The game also prompts you to buy the sequel, which I guess will be another 3-4 hour campaign. Meh.All in all: I've played online flash games that are deeper than this. The gameplay itself is okay, but the game is really not worth it. You can say its low prize compensates for the lack of features, but you can also get a Heroes of Might and Magic OR King's Bounty game for similar prizes, especially during sales, and they're 20 times more replayable and deep than this.Skip this game, it has absolutely nothing to offer."

Time passed, I discovered theKing's Bounty remakes by 1C(which is like a casualised HoMM) and loved those too -Armored Princessis my #1 singleplayer-only game in terms of hours spent at the time of writing. Time passed once again and the cycle continues. I discovered Braveland, which I consider a casualised King's Bounty. I want to believe this is the bottom and there is nowhere else to go, especially not downward.The world is explored along predetermined paths. There is no castle management. Hero stats and upgrades are next to meaningless. The writing is very generic. The combats (on a hexagonal grid) feel satisfying but lack depth. The look of the  interface makes me think it was designed for mobile devices first and ported to PC later.It might sound like there are many issues but those are relative, and visible mainly when compared to more complex representatives of the genre. Perceived alone, Braveland is decent and brought me quite a bit of fun. It's relaxing and I still enjoyed seeing the story to its conclusion, collecting gold for troops, figuring out efficient combat orders. The graphics are okay and the music fits the atmosphere. I also appreciated that it's possible to get all of the achievements in one playthrough, even when playing on Hard (which is barely hard). If you end up with a ""fun but shallow"" opinion of Braveland, check out the games I mentioned in the first paragraph."

Basically, it is a short, kind, may be somewhat naive, fairy tale with not over-complicated tactical battles.It took me just three evenings to complete the game, and it doesn't make much sense to replay it as I played on the hard difficulty, and although there is a survival mode as well, the core game is just a one-time trip, during which one sees pretty much everything of it. Even though the game can't be technically called absolutely linear, there is not much real freedom of exploration or choice.I really liked the cute and positive art style (think HoMM1/2), although I would say that the interface is somewhat coarse and make one think about casual/mobile games. Oh, wait... it is a casual mobile game, after all.The story (which is presented via short dialogues) is simple and not particularly deep, but exactly suits the general style of the game.The global map reminds me of Puzzle Quest, where you travel between fixed points, to fight a fight or/and get the next piece of story, which is a fine format for me.The tactical battles can be obviously described like HoMM-lite, and it is clear, that the encounters were designed so that they don't last more than few minutes. Some might like it, yet some might find them lacking complexity and depth. But again, the game does not pretend to be hardcore strategic. Having said that, certain design choices are still rather strange, +1% troop defense for a hero attribute point, seriously?(you hardly have 10 by the end of the game, so, basically, neither your hero's 'build', nor equipment really matters).So, to sum up, Braveland offers an enjoyable relaxed experience for some 6 hours, maybe little more. It is a little game, but it is nice and fun."

Very nice to play in short bursts.My gripes with Braveland is because it's too short. I suppose I was expecting some 20 hour game, more side-missions, or anything to prolong my play time, other than the Survival mode. Also, I'm not usually very good at strategy games, but I was able to beat Braveland on Hard my first time around, just to give a general idea how easy this game can be.My verdict: Check it out if you got some spare change and want a very casual strategy game to play.
