76561198126815235,Recommended,285820,16671283,"Posted: 24 June, 2015",all,Pickle Spic FaggotThank you,"This game started as a friend coming over to my house on release day and literally forcing me to purchase it, to that night spending 8 hours taking turns with the controller beating each others times. After rainbowing all of the original levels I fell away from it for a few months. Then with the introduction of the new levels and multiplayer I have not been able to stop playing this game! I'm now in the top ten and have a WR on a level and have no intentions of stopping as there is so much I can do and play.The multiplayer is perfectly done, you can chat, throw in a taunt and see what others are doing. If you were good enough then you can gloat from the podium. I haven't even mentioned the level editor that allows you to make your own levels that are downright devious or just flat out fun!The level designs are fun, yet challenging. The earlier levels are easy to play hard to master, and the later levels are just plain challenging. It is vibrant with lots of colors great animations and environments, and tons of amazing eastereggs. The developers of this game obviously made it as a passion project. It is a hotwheels meets speedrunners and is just incredible. BUY THIS GAME! It is the next huge indie game IMO and these devs deserve every penny!"
,Recommended,285820,18340846,"Posted: 5 October, 2015",all,|lDgAl|badBlackShark,"This is honestly one of the most amazing games I have ever played.GAMEPLAY:It's a perfect example of how the principle ""easy to learn, hard to master"" should be implemented into a game. It only has a very limited amount of controls, only run, jump, reset (to start or checkpoint) and, in some levels, hook. That means you don't have to remember much. Finishing the track at all isn't hard at all (excluding the very last set of levels). But getting a time good enough to beat the gold medal (for beginners) or the rainbow medal (for more advanced players) gets very hard very soon. And even IF you manage to beat all normal tracks with the rainbow medal, defeat all your opponents in challenges and collect all the coins of the bonus levels in time, that doesn't mean that the game doesn't offer anything anymore. There is still an online multiplayer to play with friends or meet new ones. You can build your own tracks or play some of other members of the community. You can try to further improve your time on tracks to reduce your combined time of all tracks to get a better rank on the global leaderboard, or to get a top 10 time on a track, or maybe even a world record. Once you master all the little mechanics that might be hard to pull off, but save you alot of momentum and time when done correctly, you can spend countless hours grinding levels to get a better time. And when you think you got everything done, then someone finds a new mechanic, a new route or a skip, and it starts all over again.COMMUNITY:The members of the community are all awesome people. Never have I found people that are more friendly than the Action Henk community in any game. Once you reach a certain level of play, and you get in touch with some of the higher ranked members, you get tips and tricks on how to get better times pretty much daily.On top of that, the developers are extremly supportive in every possible way and really try to give everyone the best possible experience. I've never seen devs so nice anywhere (thanks for the awesome time at Gamescom while I'm at it <3)!WHAT IS BAD?Sadly, multiplayer is pretty empty most of the time, but that's not the game's fault. Also, if you are not into grinding, doing stuff over and over again until it's perfect than the game doesn't offer much to you after a while.SHOULD I BUY IT?If you are impatient, get upset easily and can't stand doing stuff over and over again, then it's questionable. Getting the rainbow medal everywhere is certainly not easy and will take quite a long time, so if you only want to go for completion, this game offers you probably between 30 and 60 hours of gameplay, depending on how good you are. If you like getting stuff as perfect as possible and if you are a competitive person, then this game offers you at least 200 hours of gameplay, but probably more, as more routes and strats are getting found weekly. For the little price of this game you get more gameplay than in alot of AAA titles that cost 4 times as much, so I would definatly say: Buy it!"

,Recommended,285820,28507340,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,MaranTheLemon,"At first, Action Henk looks like a small, simple game, the type that you would play maybe once or twice a week if you got bored. But there's just something about it which just makes you want to play it more and more. This is a very addictive platform speedrunner that encourages you to get the best times possible, matching you up against bronze, silver, gold and even rainbow AI 'ghosts', to play against. You can learn from the ghosts and get better at the game, you can race your friends live on online multiplayer or try to beat their best time. Local multiplayer is also an excellent feature as you can simply gather some friends around (when you have nothing else to do!) and see who is the fastest of them all. This game is very fun to play when you get into it, and there is a huge online Henk community building up. There's a steam group, a discord server and aspeedrun.comsite that I would strongly recommend if you have gotten all the rainbow medals and are looking for something else to do. Basically, this game is amazing and I love it. What would I say about Action Henk in general? Well... let's just say, I used to play other games."

,Recommended,285820,15857695,"Posted: 16 May, 2015",all,Magical Purple Man,"This game is basically Sonic 1 meets something akin to Trackmania.It's a race to get the fastest time in the levels to gain medals and progress. The game doesn't have the most mechanics, mostly consisting of the track its self, sliding and occasionally a hook shot, It starts off relatively simple and it gets much, MUCH harder as you go through the game, all while listening to a fantastic heart pumping soundtrack.There are 10 zones in the game with 9 different themes, starting off with the easy going early worlds, and ending with face paced levels that will test you, and you will fail, many times.As you go you will unlock more characters to play as (6 in total), you unlock them by doing their challenge at the end of each world, the later ones are instead different costumes for the characters which you can unlock and use yourself. Getting all golds in a world will also grant access to a bonus level of which you must pass by finding the most efficient way of going around the track while collecting gold medals to unlock more skins for each character. Some skins are also unlocked through achievements.Despite all that there are some flaws.-No re-bindable controls (at time of writing)-Tricks that are nearly necessary in the later worlds are often taught though random loading screen tips (using the ghosts as a example can be hard to follow let alone watch without these tricks)-The physics can feel a bit floaty at times, especially on the grappling hook-Crashes a fair amount during multiplayer (atleast on my side)Despite all this, the game is fantastic and is great fun to play and is constantly challenging you throughout the many worlds and I'd highly recommend it if you're into this type of game."

It gives it almost a Toy Story feel.

76561198025781134,Recommended,285820,11147241,"Posted: 9 July, 2014",all,Punqtured,"This is one of those games, where there's just not a right time to stop playing. You always need JUST ONE more try - then you miss a jump only by milliseconds, and imediately hit the retry button! I ended up spending well above an hour on one level alone. This would normally drive me mad, but since each level is relatively short/fast, you don't get the same level of agony as the Classic platformers where a restart would easily cost you 10 minutes.The sense of speed is great, the physics and game mechanics is really amazing, and I particularly like the way the sucktion cup Works and feels. After more than 3 hours of playing, I still have levels to complete, and there's even more levels to come soon. So I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes a fast paced game, that also requires learning and skills, and offers a hilarious and surreal twist to childhood memories as you race through the levels. Graphics are well polished, the tech Works flawlessly and the music suits the game really nice, too. Oh, and: I MADE IT TO TOP-10 ON HOOK MAZE! :D"

In the absence of any HYPE, 135 positive Steam reviews and 2 obligatory negative, played for 5 minutes / ""joke"" reviews pretty much sum up how good this game is. There are no half measures, everyone that played it doesn't like it, they LOVE it. The rest are too engaged in the game to write a review.I have a few games in my library which could be compared to it, Speedrunners would be one, Trials Fusion would be the other. Action Henk fills glaring gaps that exist in both these games. As well as having multiplayer it's enjoyable in singleplayer as a leaderboard game. The tracks are fun, the visuals are quirky and for something which looks so simple the game mechanics are completely unique with a devilish skills gap the reason why singleplayer and leaderboarding are so addictive.I can't recommend the game enough."

This fatman moves as well as you would expect from gameplay videos, he handles like a dream.Don't expect many levels or challenges yet, though; the game is in a really early stage and the content is scarce. And though I hope for more interesting elements in the tracks, it seems much is to be done.The two problems I have with this game lay within the setting, which I find a bit confusing (how does a toy get overweight? who is making all these tracks? is the toy alive? maybe it doesn't matter), and the art direction. The character designs so far are terrible. And I wouldn't complain about them if I didn't know better, they could be having so much more fun with toy designs! Action Henk himself is not half bad but Betsy, oh god, she's an abomination from Hell. The environment is ok but, like I said before, I hope they start including better elements related to toys and more interactive tracks.Overall, I'm glad I bought it, it's fun, it's energetic.

Input feels like it's instant and I've never been annoyed at not getting a gold medal because my input hasn't been handled correctly, instead I know it's because I screwed up a certain section of the track.I also have to say the level design so far has been really, really good and they've nailed the whole theme of toys running on a matchbox tracks setup in crazy designs."

No, not really, but still, for the asking price there isn't a lot of content or polish. A few different settings, which are ultimately the same. A new gimmick here and there (for example a swing mechanic that is only ever used in 1 setting, instead of combined in other levels). The rest is all passive...jump and slide, that's pretty much it, and hit objects at exactly the right angle and time for maximum effect. The game lacks a tutorial. New elements (apart from the grapple) are introduced without telling you how to tackle them. For example, did you know that loopings are best done sliding? You will eventually get a pre-game tip that tells you this, which is unacceptable. At least a ""how to play"" section needs to be part of the game. Other than that it's just another run of the mill runner. Joe Danger 2 is better for example if you're looking for that kind of thing. However, this also includes a level editor and online rankings, so at least you can get lots of play time out of it if you're not bored to death. I'm 2 hours in and almost done with the game. I COULD get all the gold medals to unlock more characters and get the best times, but just not what I'm primarily looking for in a game. So, pick this up during a sale for 5 bucks.I forgot to mention that the game can be unfairly hardcore at times....but I guess that's not really a fault, but a feature."

,Recommended,285820,18179530,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,What Am I?!,"Action Henk is a video game where you jump, slide, combine the two then slide and jump to get more speed on your next run. I very much like the concept of this game and it has phenomenal graphics. If you are in a position where 17 dollars is not very much to you (or however much it is in your country), then by all means this is a great buy.However... this review is very borderline positive as I was rethinking my opinions on this game. I love all of its content, but the combination of it in a game like this makes it seem less than it is after you've played it enough. Let me explain.Jumping, Sliding, Hooking, Landing Properly. That's all this game consists of. Because of this, getting a world record time in this game is next to impossible, because all you do is literally practice this combination. In a game like trials, mechanics are its #1 priority before graphics and sound design. In this game, however, its architectural design and all of the major appealing features seem to be the key. In terms of feature diversity, it takes but 10 minutes for you to gain and lose a world record. I would like to emphasize, however that this paragraph is not intended to be directed towards cheating players, as that is an entirely different topic. This game is deceptively difficult.Oh yeah. Multiplayer works, but nobody ever really goes on it... so there's that.But where I stand about its flaws, I think anybody can agree that not only is the sound design near flawless... So is the graphics, mechanics design and momentum rules. That alone merits a +1 from me. It's very easy to tell that years of work went into a game like this and the level editor makes it a lot more enjoyable to a first time player. If you are the type of person who is just looking through steam to see which games are worth buying, please don't let my negative views on some of the content discourage you from buying it. If you aren't competing for world records or looking for some interesting game content to impress you, it's worth every penny.Would I recommend it to my friends? Not at its current state. The ending of the game is not beginner friendly and it gets needlessly complicated near the last levels. If the authors of this game could pad the game a lot more between these levels, I would consider recommending it. The game makes an absurd difficulty spike at the end. If you don't have the patience for it, the spike is worse than trials'.Just thought I would voice my opinion about it. Thanks for reading!"

It's a fun game either playing by yourself or with friends. Simple concept but with some intricate control timings that will allow you to eke out a better time.Single player: Each level has 3 preset time medals to shoot for (bronze, silver, gold). The quicker the time, the better the medal. This will allow you to know how you are doing and where you're supposed to be. Also your time is record via record boards against all other players to also let you know how you stack up.Multiplayer: You're given a set amount of time to complete the course as quickly as possible. Whoever finished the course as quickly as possible wins.

Basically, this is a speedrunner's dream/nightmare come to life. You play as Henk, an old action figure who retired and got a bit of a pudge. The story is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ named Kentony stole a trophy of yours, and you gotta get it back. Yeah, not much story, but this game doesn't need it when you GOTTA GO FAST!!! Yes, I used a dumb meme, but that's the point of the game: GOTTA GO FAST!As a young man who absolutely loathed time trials as a child (looking at you Crash Bandicoot: Warped), the fact that I'm racing against the clock to get medals doesn't discourage me in this game. If anything, the time trials actually encourage me to get better at the game. Yeah, you can say that about most games with a time trial mode, but the fast-paced nature of this game makes it fun to practice. And if you do rage-quit and hit Alt-F4 because you're too mad to do it normally, the game actually rewards you with both an achievement and an unlockable skin for one of the characters you can play as. Honestly, that was a nice, clever little thing RageSquid did there, and I approve of it.In all honesty, there aren't many games like this that come in mind other than Speedrunners, and this is basically that game, except you play as a pudgy action figure instead of a YouTuber of your choice. But still, this is a fun game, and if you got a spare 15 bucks on hand, go get this game. It's fast, fun, and damn fun to play. Take it from a guy who doesn't really love time trial games; this game is good. And you get to go FAST!!! BY BUTTSLIDING!!!!"

There's a lot of effort put into the level-design which is very apparent throughout all the levels.I would recommend this game and give it a solid 7/10"

Man, am I glad he did, because this game is a lot of fun, especially with friends.  The game is simple and easy to learn, but highly nuanced at the same time; you can get into it very easily, but it provides a good challenge if you wish to master it.  The controls are straightforward and responsive, which is exactly what you would want in a game like this.  As for the game itself, it's a side-scrolling platformer-footracing game.  Very fast-paced and twitchy, but it's got a certain ""groove"" and ""flow"" about it.  In my opinion, this is best played with a controller from the sofa.  It also supports local multiplayer, so it makes a great party game.  If you were ever a fan of the old Sonic games from back in the '90s, then do yourself a favor and get this game!"

It's a fast paced platformer with obstacles that requires quick thinking and resilience on the players part. The graphics are good and it performs great even when the frame rate gets a bit high. The gameplay ranges from fairly easy to very demanding, but it never gets difficult to the point where it becomes overwhelming. I usually use this game as a means to pass time, but frequently find myself playing for a lot longer. I would highly recommend Action Henk to anyone who likes these types of games. It's highly entertaining with fun characters, an engergizing soundtrack, and engaging gameplay.Also, I recommend playing with a controller."
