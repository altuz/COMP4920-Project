You can possess one ship at a time and change ships with a button press.Each ship has a limited amount of weapons and damage it can take before being destroyed. If the ship you're possessing gets destroyed, you have to start the area over again.The game progressively gets harder and has ways to prevent you from possessing ships. Sometimes you have to possess other objects like rocks, but you have to be careful not to go offscreen or you'll have to restart the section.You have each ship's basic weapon and the button to switch to another ship.I don't think its worth $10, but I gladly paid $1 for it during the summer sale. I have 1.5 hours into the game.If its on a sale, consider getting it if you want a unique and challenging shooter."

It will frustrate you to no end with the learning curve with each level and wave, but that's where the fun of the game is. Its not so difficult that new players will struggle, but its definitely difficult enough to challenge most players.The main mechanic, jumping from ship to ship, is awesome. I did not expect it to work as well as it does in this game. I highly recommend it for its excellent use of this simple element."

The mechanics are unlike any I'd ever seen, it actually has a running (and apparently mutable) story, and it doesn't rely on being a bullet hell to be challenging.The sound is great when it comes to having an old-school sound without sounding too... beepy-boopy.The music adds quite well to the atmosphere to boot!"
,Not Recommended,285840,11123721,"Posted: 7 July, 2014",all,Link Satonaka,"I can't really recommend the game as is, but I'm under the impression that the problem I'm having will be corrected in the future. Time of writing is July 7th 2014, if there have been any patches since then, this review might not be accurate.So this game is not bad, let's be clear: I simply am not recommending it as a bullet hell/retro shooter enthusiast for the current price. The system seems unpolished: The bounding box, timing, and rules for what bullets collide with what object just don't have the professional intuitive shine that say, Deathsmiles has. I know I'm comparing a company team to an indie developer, but that doesn't make the problems any less noticeable. Other problems: enemy ships can do things you cannot when you possess them (most egregiously: turning around and shooting the other way), and the teleporting beam trajectory could be better (as is it's rather awkward; also it has a charge up time which has absolutely no user feedback).But this game has a story focus! Pretty rare for this type of game. If the gameplay is just average, how is the story? I'd like to know, too. Thoughout the game you get snippets of story, and it creates a very interesting experience... but I personally think the novelty of the gameplay has an expiration far shorter than the time it would require to go through the game twice (to collect all the snippets of story). However, I never actually finished this game, so I don't know how the story concludes. The difficulty for the entire game is, despite the problems named above, quite easy. Dying is infrequent for those experienced with this genre, and there are no difficulty settings to adjust. The boss fights, once you figure out how to win, are also not hard at all. Then you get to the end of the second to last wave and find that it is near impossible. Brick wall. Not many players will proceed past this point.I might have kept trying if I could actually get to that segment again quickly. But since it's at the end of the wave, you need to replay the entire wave first. Takes about 5 minutes, and it's patronizingly easy the entire time. Imagine taking a math test and every time you made a mistake on a really hard problem, before trying again you are forced to first to solve 50 basic addition problems (2+3=?). I've poured quite a bit of time in this last wave alone, and I can no longer justify repeating the patronizingly-easy-5-minutes-snooze-fest even one more time just to retry a 10 second difficult segment.Despite my rant, I'd say those who love this genre should pick it up next sale. But even if I didn't have any trouble completing it, I still feel that this game is a one-and-done deal; you'll play it, you might enjoy it, but once you uninstall it you probably won't be revisiting it.edit- a word"
76561197999444902,Recommended,285840,33132050,Posted: 2 July,all,CrimsonKingXXX,"I bought this game in Summer Sale 2017 and here is my review:Im going to start with the biggest drawback:Hardware / TechIm trying to run this game in 2560*1440 and its not supporting that resolution. There are a ton of reports about it but as far as im concerned the DEVs didnt state its not working nor did they provide a fix or workaround. So, i can assure the best you can do is 1920*1080.With that resolution, the same does have some minor slowdowns (on my machine) in certain areas.Im using a Xbox 1 wireless controler with stock MS wifi connector and its working alright.All in all, i give this game a 06/10 when it comes to the tech because basicly i feel like selling a game that is 2 years old ? but doesnt support high end resolution is a major letdown.In addition, i encountered a fatal bug. When i tried to control an enemy ship, my vessel went out of bounds (= the game was stuck in a loop and i was sliding along the ground, without and screen transisitions happening, ever).I feel like this really sucks and i hope i dont lose another 30 minutes again.Saving:The game is divided into 8 big levels which are split into like 5 segments each, with a boss at the end. You cant save, but when you finish a level (LEVEL), you can start at that point in the future. There are checkpoints at the start of each SEGMENT. This is fine with me.Graphics:The game uses a very retro pixel art. While being kinda minimalistic, its a very great art style and fits the game good. Animations are decent. Also there is paralax scrolling when it comes to background and stuff (which are also pixel art and awesome). Personally, i like the visuals A LOT and im happy we dont have some crappy 2d renders but instead minimalistic, yet beautiful pixel art.08/10Gameplay:The game is a shoot em up along the lines of Gradius and R-Type. There is no shop-system like in Raptor or Tyrian.The game also plays left/right and not bottom/up.it has a very nice spin though in that instead of having different weaposn available, you are free to take control of any enemy ship you can see, permanently. So, instead of having one ship with 20 different guns, you basicly have 20 ships with one gun each, though they arent freely available (obviously they need to be on screen to take control of them). I find this really cool and it also offers a ton of strategic options because these ships move and attack differently. In addition, they have different Health.You will be constantly change ships, because each ship only has a limited amount of Ammo. It feels good in that regard.08/10Music:Like most Indis with retro (pixel) graphics, it also uses retro 16 bit (?) music. I think the mudis fits the game greatly.08/10Story:Without spoilering, this game has a decent story. Depending on which ship control when finishing a level, you will get different ""part"" of the full story being told (3 factions, 3 stories which make sense when interwined).Personally, i feel like the story could be expanded upon. Getting 2 or 3 sentences for each level feels like its being cut short.7/10Overall concensus:All things considered i give this game a 7.2/10 and this is mostly because the whole resolution thingy is a major issue for me. I wish it would be fixed. Also, i think this game and the whole (mind control) thingy has a TON of potential. I kinda wish the Devs would expand the game either via an addon or a second part.Without the tech hickups (and assuming there are no more out-of-bounds-bugs) i can fully suggest this game to anyone that likes shoot em ups and (easy) bullet hell games.Its CURRENTLY down 80 % and i think its even a really solid buy for the full price.IF the resolution-switching of windows doesnt bother you OR you run 1920 ether way."

Each wave is a new challenge to surmount, and in later levels strategies can be formed to defeat each wave.+ For a shoot'em-up style game, the story is exceptional. The story-telling in the game is both clever and well-written.+ You can shoot the credits+ The Aratus, the opposing force to the humans, are more interesting aliens than those in other games+ Bosses were creative. They weren't just bullet sponges, and the mind-control mechanic is realy put to the test in these fights. There were all rewarding to defeat+ For once, points were something I acutally cared about. I felt amazing to see those numbers go up.Cons:- The difficulty spike of the last level was unwarranted; the levels leading up to it should've matched this difficulty slope- There was inexplicable fps drops at seemingly random* moments, despite my computer being more than capable of running the game* ""Random"" meaing completely unpredictable. Happened about 3 times in 10 hours of play (No general interval of time between them)Final thoughts:A must-buy if on sale. Even if it isn't, I'd say its worth the $10 anyway. Gameplay is innovative in the best kind of way. It honestly just makes sense, rather than being some weird gimmick. Art syle is fantastic, even with its low resolution.

I remember thinking it looked interesting, a nice game to play when Im bored or just want to turn my brain off and focus on the pretty wetty patterns that the enemy bullets made. Poor little me did not do nearly enough research. The game is broken into 8 levels, I have only beaten 5 but I feel like I have gotten far enough to write this review. This game is filled with terrible, terrible flaws and great high points. Unfortunately I feel the negatives outweigh the positives. But I will try my hardest to stay positive for this review.1. Neutral, The Major Mechanic is the ability to switch between ships at the press of a button and a steady aim. This makes this game quite unique and stand out and is great fun. ""Oh no I'm out of ammo and have no health! Never fear now I control an even better ship with more helth more ammo and blah blah blah"" You basically capture the enemy and take its abilities... Except thats not exactly what happens. Some enemies have different powers or health when you switch to them as opposed to when you play as them which sometimes really really sucks. And is incredibly stupid in some boss fights.2.  Negative, The length of the levels and more than two handfuls of waves are just tooo long. Its incredibly annoying dying right at the end of a  wave and having to travel back 2 minutes.3. Posit-treul, Dying is handled pretty well. If you die you start back at the beginning of the wave. If you game over tho same thing happens. Which kinda makes lives kinda pointless.4. Positive, The game looks very nice. Everything feels detailed and beautiful. That is all I have to say. Seriously. If you want proof just look up some screenshots.5. Positive-Super Negative, There are two kinds of bosses in the game: formations and bosses.(wow that was a weird sentence) The formations are a collection of ships all trying to murder you all at once, generally varying in different types, generally this fights are a mad dash to grab the ship you wan without being killed, then trying to take out as many as you can before your ship is spent, then trying to get a new ship before they kill you. These fights are super fun. On the other side of the coin you have general bosses. These. Guys. Suck. SO! MUCH! Lemme just say I threw myself at the level six boss for an hour and ragequited after making 0 progress. The other ones didn't fare much better.Final Thoughts: the main part of the game is super fun and exactly what I hoped and expected. Unfortunatley the INFURIATING bosses and the occasionally really long waves. Kinda ruined it for me (One waaaaaaay mre than the other) If I were to make any changes to the game It would be to cut boss fights all together. And tweak the length of a couple waves.If you see this game on sale I would recommend it. But as of Its normal price I don't recomend it."

Controls for some ships, particularly the multi-directional ones, are really ugly to work with.  This becomes the primary challenge later in the game, especially when fighting the Oroborous boss.  Segments where you have to swap with debris to get through a debris field are generally dull, and quickly become frustrating when said debris veers offscreen unexpectedly.  This is further compounded by the fact that your swap-shot disappears at the edge of the screen, so it is possible to be lining up for a shot and find that your shot disappears upon firing.  This is also aggravating when you are expecting it to come back, but it gets too close to the edge of the screen and vanishes.So good idea, but I can't really recommend it to anyone.  Needs way more polish."

This game takes the cake..A week or two ago, I tried Syder Arcade out, based on many positive reviews.  I wasn't really happy with the game at all.  Kind of sad. So, I picked up Enemy Mind and was instantly impressed by the entire package.  Sounds, music, and graphics are spot on.  A lot of attention to detail was given to this game.You have a lot of freedom here to change up the gameplay.  Seemlessly jumping from ship to ship feels fluid and brings a unique perspective on how to get the most points per wave.  I can see myself playing this over and over to get up there on the leaderboards. :)I haven't tried the local co-op yet, but it'd be nice to see an online co-op mode added later down the line.I'd say pick this up, even at full price.

76561198198830105,Not Recommended,285840,34043488,Posted: 5 August,all,PhoenixSpectre,"I wanted to like this game. The idea of being able to take over any ship in the game and use it? Awesome idea! It's just the every other aspect of the game is mediocre at best.The waves are fine, not unfair, but not very much thought went into them. Just clusters of enemies put together because, well, it's a wave of enemies. The controls are *terrible*, at least for mouse and keyboard, and it limits what buttons you can bind to in such a way that there's no reason to even try, because the convenient buttons aren't allowed. And nowhere was I informed it was meant to be played with a controller until I loaded up the game, which was irritating sinceI don't own a controller and wouldn't have purchased the game had I known.To add insult to injury, every time you run out of lives you have to restart the entire game. Each death puts you at the start of the wave, but every game over restarts the entire game. That sounds fine, and it's not the worst thing, but it means that after a couple game overs it's not even worth slogging through the same mediocre waves over and over to get back to new content.The story is vaguely interesting, but not enough to keep me willing to slog through the levels over and over after a game over to try to get new story. It's 2 sentences of story per wave beaten, which doesn't motivate me to go through the same levels to get the next tiny clip."

The challenge is spot-on and the levels and ships all look and control fantastically for a two-button shooter.There's coop if you're into that but the single-player game is highly replayable. No achievements which puts you in complete control of what and how much you want to play whenever you want to. There are also fun yet useless side games (one immitates flappy bird with a spaceship and another has you going through an entire chapter as a floating meteor in space) as well as a boss rush mode. Oh and the graphics are sharp, detailed and the soundtrack is pitch perfect.The only nag I have with the game is that although it has great variety in enemies, there isn't much in the bosses. The later ones are just stronger versions of the original with a new move.The shooting is frantic and enjoyable and the story is vague enough to justify the happenings, although you're better off ignoring it altogether. Enemy Mind constantly puts you in a strategically action focused situation and all of it is exhillirating for such a small game.  It will put a grin of satisfaction on your face the moment you start playing.Buy this!"

In most arcade style space shoot-'em ups, you'll pilot your ship through a level, all the while collecting powerups or weapons that may make your craft stronger. In Enemy Mind, your ship has the ability to take over and ""transfer consciousnesses"" into any other enemy ship. Each craft also has a limited ammo supply, so you'll usually want to expend your entire ammo clip before transferring over to another ship. This creates a gameplay style where the optimal strategy is also the most fun one: blow all your ammo trying to kill everything on the screen, transfer to another ship, rinse and repeatThe playstyles and designs of the enemy ships are varied and interesting enough to make it exciting each time you encounter a new type of enemy craft. It makes the player want to take it over immediately and experiment around with how much armor the craft has and how its weapon systems work. Some craft are agile with fast firing, low damage weapons. Some craft are slower with huge area of effect damage style explosions. Some craft are themselves weapons and are designed to be torpedoed into other craft to drill through their hulls. There's also an accompanying story that is played after each stage in the single player campaign, but I almost entirely ignored it. It was doled out in little text lines one at a time and it seemed mostly forgettable and inconsequential.SummaryEnemy Mind isn't a revolutionary arcade style shooter, but it's a lot of fun. If you like games like Galaga, you'll have a good time with Enemy Mind. Navigating the bullet hell that the enemies throw at you while throwing back a bullet storm of your own while simultaneously possessing and experimenting with new craft and different playstyles felt really good. The boss battles are challenging and unique. There's also a couch co-op multiplayer mode, but I unfortunately haven't gotten a chance to check it out yet. This seems like the kind of game that would be fun to screw around in for a little while with another friend. I wouldn't go out of your way to buy it immediately, but it's worth a look if you find it discounted on a Steam sale or something like thatFor more game reviews, check outhttp://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/"

There is too few types of enemies, there could be a shop of some kind and currency that you can buy upgrades with, some kind of superpowers that you can choose after defeating any boss. Anything.

I play a lot of shmups so it's getting more and more difficult to find one that really feels different, but this one with its awesome mind-taking-overing power really surprised and impressed me.I thought it might be just a kinda gimmicky addition to a standard sidescolling shooter, but I was wrong.You have the ability to take over the minds of enemy pilots, and that's your only ability. Once you do that you can fly their ship and use its weapon til ammo runs out (tightly limiting ammo forces you to always be on the lookout for a new ship, you can't find a favourite and just blast everything), or you get blown up.If you jump out of your pilot's mind just before your death blow, you can get in a new mind and keep going if you've aimed/timed the jump properly. It's safer to get a new mind before that point though. Each ship has a different amount of armour, with the lightest crafts taking two hits to be destroyed, so you always have a low armour warning before you explode.Each ship has its own unique weapon or playstyle or both, and trying them all was a lot of fun. Also the game is really built around the concept, so some levels and boss fights are really unique to this game and its mechanics. I was very happy with this. Happy is good.I just finished the main story mode, and soon will have another go to re-read all the story bits now that I understand what's going on. The story is told in snippets of memories from the pilots you inhabit, and you piece things together as you go. I like that approach, and I think the story is actually pretty cool, but it may take some players more than once to get it.There's also an extras menu that unlocks (I think? That or it's empty at first) after some progression, and as you get further through the game more things are added to it. There's alternate modes, a couple of mini-games, and more. I don't want to spoil the surprise, so I'll just say that one unlock is pretty much the most realistic simulation I've ever played.So there you go, my first review. I hope it's helpful to somebody."

Well, the ships typically have incredibly low health, forcing you to jump from ship to ship without having time to shoot.

Game is actually only 2 hours long.2 (out of 8!!!) bosses are simply rehashed and powered up versions of bosses from before. How lazy you can get?Difculty spikes a lot. 99% of game is too easy, but a couple of moments are just annoyingly hard.Also, plot is poorly delivered. Never ending stream of meaningless words, pretentious but superficial and meaningless.Overall, unless you are buying it in a bundle, there is a lot of much cheaper and better games out there. Buyers remorse."

Mainly thanks to its main gimmick.PROS-You can play with a friend in co-op on the couch-Yes, you can literally steal any ship and use it, even bosses! That's petty awesome!-Pixel-art sprites, backgrounds and projectiles are all great-Sound and music are okay, but nothing to write home about-Has a clever way of telling the story from the side of the humans, or aliens, depending on the type of ship you finish a level as. This adds some replayability.-Is pretty challenging but fairCONS-Has a pretty limited repertoire of ships to steal-You'll only be facing two factions for most of the game - humans and aliens-Ships are both fragile and with limited ammo, so you won't be able to hang on to a certain favorite ship-Once the gimmick has become stale, it really is just a bland shooter-Story is pretty much irrelevant. You'll read it and go ""who cares""?All in all, a very solid shoot 'em up with a unique mechanic you won't find anywhere else.Highly recommend, especially if you've got a friend that can join you in co-op."

Big and small, each one with its own weapon, each different and fun to fly.  Ammo of each ship is very limited, though, and there are no power-ups and no customization: the rest of the game is actually pretty basic. Definetely fun, though, and hotseat co-op is included!

Thank god for Enemy Mind.Harkening back to classic titles such as Gradius, this space adventure game puts you in the cockpit of your very own star-ship. When your ship gradually starts losing ammunition, and it's hull is compromised, instead of just simply dying you're able to take control of another ship before it's too late. A small energy beam puts you in control of your target, and you can quickly turn the tide by using the more powerful ships against their allies.Now, I don't know about all of you, but I played the crap out of Gradius when I was a kid. The gameplay is much the same as other games of the genre, with ships shooting at eachother in gradually more difficult side-scrolling waves. There's bosses, upgrades, and the aforementioned co-op play which allows you and a friend to hunt in space together.Should you get it? Sure you should! But not for ten bucks, that's just ridiculous. Wait for the next sale to come around, and then scoop it up."

Your ship has a very limited amount of ammunition, but luckily you have the power to teleport and take over enemy ships and turn their weapons against them. Choosing the right moment to switch is as important as having good reflexes and a keen eye. The multiplayer version is also amazing and with up to four players jumping ships things can quickly descend into hilarious chaos if you aren't communicating. Cool music, nice art and the aforementioned twist keep me coming back to it.I still love this game by the way.

I'm not a big fan of the running out of ammo part, and the difficulty curve might be a bit high, but I like the story and the sense of humor.

And yes, it is difficult as well.I have not beaten the game yet. I got it on a sale or almost nothing. And it is a really good game. While playing, the mechanic of hijacking ships is very nice. why hijack? because ships have limited ammunition. limited durability. you get hit, the ship takes damage. some can take more, some only take one hit. Some ships have a lot of ammuniation, some very little. Thy have different flight characteristics too. There is even some kind of story, and you can get different views between the waves, depending on what ship you have hijacked. Only downside: It is somewhat hard and you need to have quite some patience until you beat a level. It is not made to be beaten on first try.Would definitly buy the game again."

Still, ShMUps rule and if you like 'em like I do, somewhere just south of Doujin bullet-hell with a great dose of old skool retro fun, this ShMUp's for you!The ability to jump from ship to ship near-instantly and the limited ammo make this one TRULY a novel and exciting game that forces you to think differently. Do you fire like mad and jump ships more often, or take skilled shots and prolong your time in a single ship? Never fear, if you have a favorite ship, you'll see that type plenty it seems and you can just jump from that ship type to another when your ammo gets low.A real treat and I doubt ANY fan of this type of game would not enjoy it.

The controls are very simple, but the depth of the game comes with the many types of ships you can turn into. Any ships you see, including bosses, along with some space debris, are all for the taking. The only thing about this game that may be a turnoff is its difficulty. THIS GAME IS VERY VERY HARD. You will die A LOT, and when you lose all your lives, you have to restart the entire chapter over again. The difficulty comes from the fact that each ship you possess can only take a few hits before it's destroyed, and only has a small amount of ammo, to encourage you to change ships. Most ships only have 2 hits, and with the large number of projectiles and objects being thrown at you after the first couple of levels, it makes it very easy to die. I myself have never made it past Level 4. Overall, it's a really fun game, but you need to go into it with the fact that this game cannot be beaten without a lot of concentration, quick reflexes, and a ton of patience and determination."

You are a psychic entity capable of jumping from ship to ship, so you can take over any ship, even bosses, and play with their cool speed and weapon abilities.  The kicker?  You're in the middle of an alien war, so you can swap between human and a truly monstrous alien race for a lot of varied ship types.  It's cool and the story is actually deeper and more engaging than you might think, with two reachable endings and one nearly impossible one.  Only gotten the easy ones.  It's a surprisingly deep story that balances humanity's past sin vs the love of the individual and the human drive to survive.  And you learning to choose a side between the two.This game has a great story and a truly unique concept that will keep you coming back.  I love it, give it a look."
