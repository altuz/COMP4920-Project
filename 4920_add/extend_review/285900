Make Online and you will literally make like a million dollars, this game is near perfect even at this early of a stage, it lacks online though, add online, please? I will give you more money, take my life savings, even my soul just add online.Edit: :D so glad my review is helpful!. Also to people who want online but can't wait, I use Chrome remote desktop to share with my friends, they play with the keyboard and I use a controller, there's a little lag but it works!All jokes aside. Really guys, Adding online would be SUPER beneficial to your support, sales, and popularity as a game company, because people don't really go over to eachother's houses as much in the current internet generation, online is most of what we do, it's easier, and even more fun! So hopefully my review is seen by a dev, and online can finally be added. :)Edit2: THEY ADDED AN ONLINE BETA!!!! SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS <3"
,Recommended,285900,22762345,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,GrimRT,"My friends and I absolutely love this game to death. There are plenty of pros and cons thoughPROS:-fun game- you are able to play with multiple people on 1 computer- 8 players- fun and unpredictable gameplay- an entertaining gamemode (NPC vs Players) for when you don't have Internet- The costumes are amazingCONS:- considering that I managed to get Skyrim and all 3 DLCs for $16, it sucks that this game is $20- You can ONLY play with people that are with you IRL (I know they're working on online mode though)- Since its new, it has bugs (for example on the map with the giant fan, if every player is on 1 side of the map there is a chance that the camera will show plain black from outside of the map)SUGGESTIONS- Once you got your big stuff like online mode sorted out, lower the price to around $5-$10. It's a fun game but, if you wanna get multiplayer up and running, people aren't gonna wanna pay $80 so then 4 friends can play and having only one for $20 is kinda useless unless they're with you.- add costumes to the game that cost around 10c each and can be bought on the Steam Market and also the Main Menu. Over time this will contribute to the money that you earn and won't be too much for people to pay whilst simultaneously not being as much work as some of the other options.- Give us an ability to make profiles so then we don't have to wait for up to 8 players to choose their outfit and it will also give us the ability to have a name next to our score.- If you are doing the 10c outfit idea, set up the workshop so people can make outfits that you could look over and put into the game- you guys probably won't do it but, maybe you could do a main story kind of thing, release a mission a month or something like that so there's a little more to do when you're either alone or want to play something new.Great game, great concept, great funRight Now: 7/10Once multiplayer is up and running (assuming the HUD isn't crazy): 9/10If you add the costume idea: 10/10 (I just love the outfits)HUD Suggestions:- Keep it simple, Just have 6 buttons at the beginning- Online- Offline Versus- Offline vs NPC- Profiles- Options- Exit- Then for the Online, have password protected servers with the hosts name and server name- For the options make the Up arrow on the Num Pad registered as a different one as the Actual arrows so then there's more keys to choose from when 2 people are forced to share 1 keyboard.PS: The only reason I have so many suggestions is because I love this game and really wanna help to make it better (even if my impact is literally nothing)"
,Not Recommended,285900,32390597,Posted: 13 June,all,Thick Dick,"Its a fun multiplayer game, but it gets more buggy and worse for each update that comes maybe every 6 months or so? Its not at all worth the asking price, and it seems like a long-term cash grab by the developers. I want this game to be good, or at least better and done, but using 3 years in early access with a ridicoulus asking price for what little this game has to offer make me bitter and angry, because the game itself is REALLY fun (at least with the older, less buggy builds) but the whole goddamn thing seems to me like the laziest attempt at making money, because its not big, it doesnt have particularly good graphics, and doesnt have a lot of content, so leave it unless its on sale for 5$, because I have been waiting for this game to get better, but it gets more expensive, more buggy and more frustrating."
,Not Recommended,285900,24982916,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,farcryjohn,"Since last year, me and my room mates have enjoyed drinking and playing this game together. The last update however, made the game significantly less fun. It was so bad, that we actually put the game down after only fifteen minutes. This is the shortest that we have ever played the game. All in all, the latest update is a very large step backward.The first of my three biggest complains, is that that knockouts are totally broken. You can't knock people out anymore. If you hear the *crack* sound when you knock someone out, they're back up within a second. This takes all the fun out of watching helplessly as someone clumsily tries to throw you over a railing. It's almost impossible to even throw someone out now in the wrestling ring arena now. The only way we were able to get someone out, was when the game glitched, and the person trying to pick up someone knocked out flew into the air.The second, is that the climbing mechanics are practically nonexistant. A large portion of the game's appeal to me and my room mates, was trying to grab onto someone climbing a wall, and pulling them off. The new climbing is awful. We used to be able to scale the wall in the train arena to avoid being hit by the train, but you can't even get that high anymore. Even worse, if you try to continue to climb after running out of ""climbing stamina"", you slide back down the wall. On a similar note, it appears that the grip strength has been reduced as well. This has also been very frustrating.The third issue, is that the lives no longer appear on screen anymore. It turns out that if you hit the back button, you can see them, but that's extremely inconvenient.As much as it pains me, I can't recommend this game until the developers have either fixed these issues, or rolled back to the previous version. This really is a great game, and the developers have been on top of updating it and adding new levels. I would still reccomend this game, but I hope that this negative vote is enough to get the attention of the developers."

I have played this countless hours leading up to this Early Access release and I am thorougly excited about the new features and goofiness that awaits.There is something incredibly appealing about watching plasticine-looking somewhat drunk people punch each other in the face and throw each other into dangerous situations.If you're having some friends over for a gathering, grab some controllers and play this gem. I have not heard this much screaming since the original Smash Brothers.We will continue to make this our end of week game in our studio, good job Boneloaf. All the best. Looking forward to every moment that Gang Beasts has to offer.*EDIT To clarify my 'countless hours' into the game. There has been an earlier copy available for months that I have been playing obsessively with work mates and friends. The Steam copy has lots of new features and tweaks that make it far superior to the old 0.0.1 - 0.0.3 version that were previously available."

We would be screaming at 2am and everything. Im talking about 20-30 nerds all lining up to play this game, this is only played at our parties when everyone is over.But since this new update came out, we all slowly started hating the game. It drastically changed how the game is played. Now everyone can't stand it due to the fact that they made it literally impossible to knock out each other, games now last 10 mins sometimes just trying to hit each other and the fact that the recovery time is 2 seconds or less. You can't even scale walls now, the climbing has been made ""stupider"" and the movements are just limited. Before we were able to knock each other out and be able to toss and earn that knock out, and even climb on maps like elevators/girders and have epic wall battles. We actually get tired playing the ♥♥♥♥ing game now and have to take ""hand stretch breaks"" after mashing the buttons so much because no one stays knocked out or you can't even knock them out. I have no clue wtf the devs were thinking.They need to create some type of menu that allows people to adjust if how hard the players can hit or some type of knock out timer and climbing factor. The fact that everything is just ""up in the air"" frustrates us especially with how bad the most recent update has been. Everyone can now just grab and sucide, no one is scared to get knocked out because its really hard to knock out people now, so just grab and jump off.The fact that its also been 2 years and limited maps or not allowing users to create new maps is a bit frustrating as well. I've rather them forget the online crap and just focus on creating more maps/content for what it was really intended and even working on making 8 players easy and not making everyone jump through loops to get that to work. This game is expensive as hell too for $20, and how limited it is?This is my first review and I never want to do them but this update has literally drove me to write one. I seriously hope they make a menu for more customization in how the knockout/climbing/grappling system works or at least let some of us revert back to the old versions because none of us can stand this new version. No offense but to anyone who thinks this is good currently hasn't been playing since the beginning thats for sure or just one of those ""i saw it on twitch and it look fun, i play it for 1 hr and give it a thumbs up"" reviewers.If they keep this new style of hard to knock out and weak climbing - I wouldn't recommend unless you like ruining your hands and controller mashing for hours.If they actually change it back or give users option to revert/modify the knockout/climbing/grappling and start adding more♥♥♥♥♥♥I'll recommend it but other then that I feel like the devs are just lazy and don't pay attention. Its been 2 years, not including its prealpha stages (google it, its been on PC for longer than 2 years...) At least let users crreate♥♥♥♥♥♥or something if you are gonna give up devs!PSWe don't want LEGACY, we want the 0.3.x series, that was the best one. Legacy is too old and the joke is..we went back to it and it has a better LAYOUT then currently and even looks better...wtf is that about loll...."

It is hands down the funnest experience with friends i have ever had while gaming.If you want some of the best local multiplayer druken brawling jello fighting gaming experience look no further, buy now.(This game does not have online or lan multiplayer, only local, so dont get upset for buying it and not having it)There isn't much to say about this game other than it is amazing, just watch a youtube play of it and you will instantly know if it is for you or not.Not since super smash bros for the 64 have I stayed up so late into the night guffawing with friends. So it's simple, dont expect online, look up a youtube video, and decide if you like the idea. If you find your self laughing during any of it, you will find it hysterical among friends. Anybody I have shown this game to loves it. Even the people who profess hatred to any type of time consumption used by video games are dying of laughter when I get them to play this.So thats that, on it's own merit as a standalone game right now it is amazing.But... if you want to be a part of the development process called early access avoid entirely.These developer have a nasty habit of not comunicating anything. And they only do so when they feel the torches and pitchforks rustling. I know according to early access policy devs can no longer make promises about content or delivery, but even before that policy change these devs followed through with nothing. Here is a list of promised or assurances since december that have fallen through.""we expect the release to be this year but wanted to make a post to give information on the development road map for next year and information on our plans for sharing more frequent information about the development of the game following the Unity 5 release.""- Dec, 6th 2014That was last year, 4 months ago, never released.""We have also taken on additional freelance support to help with some development and non-development tasks (support, press, events, merchandising, legal etc.) to minimise interruptions and give the time to fully engage with Early Access."" - Dec, 6th 2014I haven't seen a dev on the forums since october (correct me if you personally have) This is the biggest lie since there has been absolute zero communication with the community since then. Last I personally heard from a dev was 6 month ago when I submitted a bug about the mouse cursor during gameplay.(and remember col. popcorn is not a dev even though he sounds affirmative like one)""There will be limited new content in the 0.1.6 release (similar to previous releases) but his will be followed by more significant content updates starting from January next year, we have setup a development log at beefcity.info to share frequent update information and other general development content (pre-viz images, play testing footage, technology tests etc.), the key content from theses posts will also be shared in weekly posts on Steam.""- Dec, 6th 2014Didn't happen, that website is the same as it was when created 4 months ago, and no weekly updates on steam even once since then.""We will continue to work on the Unity 5 port over the Christmas holiday to try to get it released as soon as we can.""- Dec, 24th 2014This sounds extremly similar to the update the just fell through for March 31st""but we are now in a position to announce 31st March as the release date for the public build of the Unity 5 version of Gang Beasts (for reference the build number will be 0.2.0)."" - Mar, 20th 2015They skipped over update 1.6, it never happened. And as of April 1st still no updates as was promised.""We will make additional posts with more specific information about the new game modes, stages, character moves, and other improvements coming in the 0.2.0 build before the March 31st release date."" - Mar, 20th 2015They never released any new infomation leading up to the update that still has yet to be released on the 1st of April.Now again, I love this game and would recommend it whole heartedly with a thumbs up if it wasnt for the point that it was in early access. And because it is in Early Access I have to look at it that way. Don't say my review wasnt helpful just because you love this game and I gave it a thumbs down, because I love it too. If the devs were to release it now for 20 bucks as a finished product I would still love it, pay full price, and be perfectly content with what was supplied. It would  be fully recommended by me and recieve a thumbs up.But it's not fully released, and it is Early Access, so I will review it with that in mind, And as far as Early Access goes this game is broken, at least as far as how Early Access is supposed to work. The devs do not communicate, they break promises, and we are left in the dark. Over a 7 month period we have recieved a couple of costumes and 2 levels. and that was all within the first 4 months. Having bought this game on its release date in August I had hoped to be a part of the communication between the devs and the community. But that has ceased to exist.It's not to say the devs are not working hard porting over Unity 5, because i know it has been done. But that  was only after searching and scrounging for information from vauge places all over the web. But with early access, the devs have put up an iron curtain, nothing gets in, and nothing gets out. And after 7 months of dealing with it, it gets real old.And bringing this all back to today, the latest release was supposed to be on March 31st. But that came and went  and the only update about it on twitter has been that they wouldnt be able to reach that release window as promised, but that they would keep working on building the release. I know the update will eventually come out, but it sure feels like I'm in an manipulative relationship, being told one thing but constantly being delivered another."

The number of lives remaining is no longer shown on screen, and each round takes much too long due to the 'knock out' changes.I will change my vote to 'recommended' again if the mechanics are fixed or adjusted for the better."

Cheers me up a little, but why can't they keep it in the stable as well? (it's only in unstable) I don't intend on ever playing online, anyway. Also, I checked it out. How could they make the hud WORSE? The text looks horrible, the menu is crappy, and where's the fun tools in-game where you can throw in bots and spheres? I couldn't test out the concussion, because i don't have another controller (i wouldn't dare touch the confusing keyboard controls) and you can't throw in bots now. So, in a valiant attempt to bring people like me back, they just made me want to refund more, but I can't, because I bought this two years ago. At least the lag in map's gone. I didn't touch the online.Keep it coming, Double Fine & Boneloaf.After this update, I just can't recommend this game anymore. The new update shortened the time that the player is knocked out for from a couple seconds to literally a split-second. How can you beat them if they're always jumping straight back up after you knock them down again? It's like they had a spring attached to their backs. The only legit way to knock them out of the stage now is by accidentlly having the jigglebones glitch so you FALCON PUNCH them out of the stage. Why bother hoping for a bug to happen?Me and my friends loved playing this game. But now we hate it.

Was such a hilrious game I bought it while on deployment. Me and my buddies played this everyday after work and we almost died of laughter everytime. We got back from delpoyment and decided to have it up at a party and it was utter garbage the current updates make it impossible to kill one another because the knock out times are incredibly short. While they updates for the maps and playable characters are cool you took away the meet and patatos of watching your buddies scream for mercy as you throw their unconsious buddy into the incenerator. It says the more you get knocked out the longer your unconsious times become but this was hardly noticeable. Fix this and it will be back to being a good game again. This is probably the first and last review i'll ever write on steam thats how much I liked this game.
,Not Recommended,285900,29112607,Posted: 8 January,all,"Folio, Prof. Dr. Net Neutrality","This game is as good as it promises; silly physics, wacky wobbly wrestler chickens and cool levels with loads of physical and other hazards are always inbound when playing gang beasts with a bunch of friends.However, since this game has been released, the devs have been in full retard mode. They patch out everything slightly complicated or not console-friendly. That includes the glitches and bugs that made this game even worth playing.The only good thing they ever patched (and they've been patching for years now) out of the game was the roundhousekick-bug.Here's a list of things that actually used to be in the game, but where patched out for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason:-you used to be able to choose player size from 4 different sizes, including absolute hulk and mini midget, now you are always the same normal size-there once was character customization with tons of different cosmetics to choose from, now you can choose from the wide variety of about 10 prefabs, and those don't even include half of the former cosmetics in their models-you used to be able to climb to almost everywhere with enough skill, making great use of the extremely detailed and wide maps, nowadays most spaces are blocked with walls your hands can't catch on, and you have a set timer for climbing after which you're just going to fall down-the maps in the game haven't increased in number at all over the years, even better; they removed more and more features from the maps so that now there's about 5 maps that are just a different collision mesh. For example there was a map with a huge fire pit in the middle, it had a conductor belt plunging boxes into that pit endlessly, and there where destroyable vents hanging from the ceiling that you could even climb through! Additionally there was a store-ish backroom with windows and a glass door. But with the latest patch they removed almost all of that and now it's literally just a huge firepit with two conductor belts (yes, they made the store windows and door unbreakable, and yes, you can't open the door anymore)-they once introduced a wave Co-op mode where you endlessly fight growing waves of grey men, you could play with 1-3 friends or alone, they even had a creative and well thought exclusive level fort that mode. With the latest patches that mode has been reduced to fighting 4 waves in the regular pvp meat grinder level. And to think that these 4 waves might be an improvement because they're well thought through or that they may have added the grey hulks which were introduced in the last update is wrong and foolish. Instead the first wave contains one grey man and the three waves after that each contain one more grey man than the last, and after that it's just ""victory!"" on the screen and your characters stop moving-for one small patch there was a debug mode which could spawn the grey men, and you could even choose if they were AI or player-controlled, if you figured it out right you would even be able to spawn in the spoken about hulk-sized greys (!!!), it was the most fun updated in forever. But because the creators of this game want to seem like a clean and user-friendly game (which it was, and now isn't thanks to the devs (gj guise)) they instantly removed it with the next full patch.In conclusion:This game is insanely fun, but the dev's make it worse and worse and I guess they'll someday just replace it with an ad or some♥♥♥♥♥♥Don't buy it, well maybe on a hardcore sale or something. It doesn't give what it once gave, and every update you will read will just leave you confused, powerless and angry."

Has a lot of the type of fun not dissimilar to Super Smash Brothers or button mashy fighting games. After a thirty minute test run, it can be observed the game runs quite well even when eight players are on screen, and even at the lowest setting the game still looks very asthetically pleasing. Coming from someone who played the free pre-alpha for at least 30 hours with different groups of friends and had an absolute blast doing it, i can say i'm very excited for upcoming updates and encourage you to buy a few gamepads and round up some friends to try it; it's really the best party game i've ever played.Pros:- Pretty cheap, indie price. (20 dollars, 15 dollars)- Lots of update potential from new developer. (It's also being produced by Double Fine.)- Functional and smooth running.- A good amount of levels ranging from wrestling rings and highways, to ferris wheels and meat grinders.- People in fox suits beating the tar out of people in chicken suits on top of moving trucks.Cons:- When running a lot of physics calculations (especially at 8 players), the FPS can chug a bit.- Climbing at it's current state is difficult to pull off.- No way to rebind controls.- The very fun sandbox level has been removed, but hopefully not for long.- Above all, the game is in EARLY ACCESS, which means it is going to have features added constantly. While the game isn't bare bones, it lacks a single player mode and a few other features. Support the developers if you can. :)In closing, Gang Beasts is a game i've had a lot of fun with, and patiently await more updates while i dangle my friends over pits of fire."

The objective is simple: kill your opponents. There are plenty of hazards which aid you in your quest. There are meat grinders, there are falls from sky scrapers, there are subway trains. Beat up your opponents and throw them to their doom! This is all carried out in a wonderfully goofy world populated with strangely dressed jello people who make silly noises and giggle at the misfortune of their opponents. It's incredible.Control SchemeI play with an Xbox 360 Controller. The default button scheme includes the left stick for movement, A/B/X/Y/LB/RB for control of various body parts. All buttons seem to have two functions: one action for a tap, and another for a hold. In the default scheme, LB and RB control the left and right arms respectively. Tapping punches, holding attempts to grasp whatever is at the end of the player's reach. This is helpful for grabbing and holding opponents. Couple this with Y which elevates the arms, and you can grab and lift an opponent over your head. Additionally, you can kick, headbutt, jump, sit, lay forward, lay backward, and many other combinations like jump kicking or climbing.A Note to Prospective PlayersWhile I wholly endorse this game and have had loads of fun playing with my friends, I recognize that not everyone has the option to regularly get together with a group of players in one place and play games. If you are the kind of person who can not easily and frequently get together with a few friends to play, I would caution that you wait until online multiplayer is completely finished. Multiplayer Beta is currently active! Find out how to joinhere. If you are in a position to be able to regularly get together with some friends and you want to laugh until you puke, check out this game."

,Recommended,285900,23415159,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,Aaron Ventus (Wolfie),"So, after buying this game for some time, can give a good review about this game. I will go with pros, cons and my conclusion of this game.Pros:The game is really fun to play. You get to beat anyone out! Like who doesn't want to beat someone out senseless, and then toss them out of the arena? its Fun and also amusing.The game allows you to use all of your limbs in the game. You get to jump and then kick someone, you can dive onto people, and to kick and punch people, and not to forget, you can headbutt people!The game has its charm of being cute and being a Bad***. There will be times that I can knock someone out and have them flying off the stage with just the kick. I just lose it when I see that happen.The game plays very smooth. out of all the games I have, this plays the smoothest. I have no frame rate issues with it, and I just love it because of it. (most likely it is still the beta and there is little to no texture in the game. Still not complaining.)Low for some cons.Lack of multiplayer. Now, I heard that multiplayer will be in a thing in the future, but with the lack of it as of now, it is a bit boring to just do the campain.The game is still buggy. Yes, the game is still in beta, but there is plenty of bugs in the game. not denying that it is fun nevertheless, the bugs are quite out there. (Example, At times, I will have my game shut off by itself after the match is done.)The game has a lot of work left to be done with it. It is still an unfinish project, but at the end of the day, it is a good game as it is right now.There are some unbalanced in the game when using certain button combos. Holding onto someone and then continuously headbutt them is kinda cheap to me. and flying kicking someone knocks them out with little to no effort.My final conclusion: This game is something that I know for sure that I can play for a long time. Even after of how long this game has been in beta, the improvements are showing little by little, and Meatloaf is making good strives to make this game the best. Balancing can be used here and there, and the bugs needs to be fixed as soon they are discovered."

( and the list goes on and on and on)So, if the devs are reading this, please reroll your latest patches and add up on that.The ""unstable"" versions are actually running with less bugs that the current version, where your character automatically grabs the ground and surrounding objects, making the game lkiterally unplayable.i would love to upvote this game again, just like i did before,but not at the previous state.I told a lot of people to get this game, now i have to hope that few actually did.Boneloaf, pls fix."

Nevertheless it is already a great game!Essentially, it is a chaotic and awesomely funny beat 'em up game. It has good controller support for I think up to four players, but I had the opportunity to play with only one other player yet. For beginners, you can take control by just pressing random buttons at a high rate, which results in accidental roundhouse kicks and arbitrary mayhem - it seems to be intended to do so in this game. Some more controlled movements like grabbing, lifting and throwing someone (over the edge) also work for me now. Overall, the game appears to be balanced through the physics involved.This leads me to the highlight I want to share in this review. I don't remember any other game constantly rendering ragdoll physics. It is usual to have ragdoll physics during uncontrolled drops or while being ""unconscious"". In Gang Beasts you always control your plastic and somewhat clumsy body. It makes the characters look ridiculous and fits well into the theme of the game. The developers did a good job to still give you the feeling of having the control. I wonder if once the game will qualify to have official championships.While it is possible to play one of the two game modes 'survival' (co-op) as a single player, the game is clearly intended to be played with friends. Perhaps further modes will be implemented in the future - I would appreciate that.A few drawbacks are there at present:- Probably because of the physics the game does not run so smoothly on my machine. You will need a bold processor to be able to enjoy smooth punches to the chin.- The standard controller binding has a quick exit key, which is accidently pressed every five minutes in game due to beginners randomly pressing buttons. A confimation dialog would help here.- There are some blind areas where the camera is not able to follow you. Perhaps this is an intended wickedness - very well.As a conclusion I fully recommend the game if you have people to play with. The price tag gives rise to some expectations for the final game."

With the right group of friends this physics-based jelly people wrestling is a blast.  Check out some videos of it on youtube.  If you laugh your head off and are desperate to play it with friends then get it.  The fighting is brilliant, and experimenting with all the different combinations of wobbly break dance fighting will earn some big laughs, and plenty of happy shouting when you throw your mate into the grinder and watch him (or her) attempt a fruitless escape.Its a bit content-light right now, but there is plenty of fun to be had, and there is loads of stuff on the way.On to the negative.  Its not a game with a great deal of replay value unless you can organise three player matches.Single player gets boring quickly after you've seen all there is to see.  You will get a lot of laughs, and certain levels will have earned a soft spot in your heart, but right now there isn't much to do past the first 45 minutes of play.Presumably, this replay factor will improve once story mode and more game modes are implemented, but right now its not a game solo fighters will want to spend $20 on.However if you have a couple of mates keen to play this with you then get on board.  At 40% off its a blast and well worth the money.  It even has the potential to replace Smash Bros as your go to fighting game with friends."

Hell. Yes.Welcome to Gang Beasts.This game is truely remarkable. The art style, the gameplay, the simple yet satisfying fighting mechanics, the ever growing set of maps. And for $20? I got it on sale for $15 after I had played the alpha and beta extensively, and I get more enjoyment out of this game when playing with friends than several other $60 games I've played. I've played this game for hours on end with friends at LAN events and at houses. It really just works.The maps are varied and interesting with plenty of map hazards (Grinders of Doom) , and the developers are adding new maps all the time. You can wrassle your comrades on top of fast moving vans on a highway, in an active subway system, in a warehouse filled with dangerous vents, in a factory with grinders everywhere in the floor, in an incinerating trash disposal plant, even on a moving ferris wheel (complete with catchy fairgrounds music).Despite the fact that it's in Early Access, It's relatively bug free compared to many other titles in the same state of development. The combat is slick and simple. You'd be surprised the maneuvers  you can pull off with just two separate punch buttons, jump, grab and a victory pose button. No online multiplayer yet. (Soon?)However the game, like many others, has its flaws. Before this gets too long, let's do some Pros and Cons :ProsGreat concept and gameplayArt style and performance/optimization are greatFantastic party game and local multiplayerGreat maps, soundtrackGood value for $20 price tagSimple and intuitive controlsConsMinor BugsRelatively small game, needs some more content (I know it's Early Access, but some weapons or something wouldn't hurt)No AI/SingleplayerNo online multiplayerDespite these flaws (that can and probably will be fixed/changed by full release), the game is incredibly fun to play and should be an instabuy for anyone looking for a fun little game for one to eight players.

In this most recent update, the developers have taken out 4 maps, and a gamemode... everytime this game updates, it just seems to get worse. the menu has degraded severely, It keeps getting more and more retro, and now it is just a disgusting pile of blue garbage.

I told all my friends about it, and today we all got together to play it. We all plugged in our controllers, went to matchmaking AND!!!!!!!! only 4 of us could play.... They removed controller support for more than 4 players. the other 2 controllers (6 people total were trying to play) were completely not working on gang beasts, we couldnt bind keys with them, couldnt do anything. Im sad to say that with the horrible control scheme and now the lack of controler support for more than 4 even though 8 is promised, i cannot reccomend the game at its current state.

The game is 100% physics based so you must learn to use your characters weight and movement along with not getting knocked out from the hail of fists coming from other players. What makes Gang Beast unique is that there is no set way or rules to play the game, everyone has there own methods and styles they apply to the game in their own way. Some people treat is more like a game of fist a cuffs and just swing for days or others go for a more direct approach trying to toss others out of the map quickly. This is what makes the game so fun, watching you and your friends flail around the map trying to finish one another off but struggling to do simplest tasks because your chubby gummy bear type character handles like he's drunk but that's OK because its extremely hilarious/fun and you enjoin every second of it.If Gang Beasts had online Multiplayer It would be an almost perfect game but sadly you are limited to the amount of friends you can get together.

I don't mind the lack of online play, I purchased the game knowing about that, with plans to play with friends locally, WHICH IS A TON OF FUN, for the most part. The biggest issue for me is how long it takes to transition after a round is over, the fade-out is super long. The music sucks (hey devs, buy my music, cheap!) but that's OK cuz you can just turn it off easily and put on your own tunes. They made it so you can turn down the annoying creepy voices too, so high points for sound options. The game REALLY needs to be opened up to the Workshop for users to develop their own vocal profiles, colors, and uniforms for the Beasts, either that or the devs need to flesh out a LOT more material for a $20 price tag. Don't get me wrong, overall this physics-based party game is full of great ideas and natural, intuitive, fun mechanics, it just needs a lot more polish for the money. On a side note, a good deal of the motions the Beasts end up making often look like common BJJ moves and positions. #HelioLives 5.5/10, could be 9/10"

Quite a fun game, but I have found the odd bug. One (That seems like one.) is playing with a keyboard. You can't grab with both hands and lift, only with a controller. Overall, this quite the fun game, and it isn't even finished. I'm pretty hyped for new updates, because of course there will be for at least awhile, it's early access, which might make some people not want to buy it.

The game has also got a really cool sountrack and good graphics (well, untextured models, but the effects like shadows and lights are incredibly good; and said untextured models are really nice actually...).It's REALLY funny to play with friends, even when alone it's not that bad since you can have fun with props and the A.I. enemies (you can spawn A.I.s and props in the stage anywhere and anytime using the number keys on the keyboard) but they are pretty dumb at this stage of developement so playing with friends is funnier and more convenient; the Race and Smash game modes are also a good addition to the game when you don't feel ""punchy""...I really suggest you to buy the game if you have some friends (and controllers), it's gonna give you many hours of silly fun!

A year and a half ago my friends and I would laugh our asses off  at the fun little game. Tragically the developers took it upon themselves to take 2 steps back for every one step forword. The physics felt meaty and heavy without hindering the gameplay. You used to have to aim and use momentum of your char to get the best punches. You could pick someone up without flying around. Like you could pick someone up and run with them, that is no more. The physics allowed the person being lifted to slightly manipulate where the person holding runs allowing for a good defense. Now the physics are downright broken and not fun. Punches feel like they control themselves. Picking someone up means your going to get knocked out by the stupid rocking back and fourth. There are moments you and the person your carrying wont touch the ground for seconds at a time cause your flying around the screen for 0 reason beside that your lifting another char. When you pick someone up it generally ends with the game tossing you into somones fist or a wall or hell even air will knock you out for no reason.Wave mode downright doesnt work. The AI only attacks player one, and refused to actually play beyond running to pre set areas and tossing punches at you like mad.Couldn't care less about online, only cause the game doesn't work enough to be fun without latency.Also graphics have been destroyed, game looks like crap compared do how it did but once again couldn't really care less.I would be fine with the sacrafice if it helped the physics... It doesntIf they realeast the game they had 2 years ago id say its a great game. Right now it just gets worse, and worse To the point where what was once my favorite couch mp game has now become a broke game that I cant even convince my friends to play.Worst of all, and I think this is the biggest problem. The developers have no idea where they want to land and how they want it to play. they seem to be tweeking rather then developing. If things keep getting worse tragiclly I think this game will be at its worst once its realesed. Every update its a bit less playable or fun."

We then searched in the server browser for servers that had low ping, and we attempted to join. The game seems to be 50/50 when loading as to whether or not you will crash or not. Even on a server where we all had around 50ms ping we could not even move as there was so much lag it was unplayable.Final Verdict: Do not buy this game unless you plan to wait for it to be finished, as they warned with the early access there are so many bugs."

76561198082496000,Not Recommended,285900,33275932,Posted: 5 July,all,Swift,"I'd like to start off saying, I love the hell out of gang beasts and have put some hours into it with my friends.Just not THIS gang beasts.When I first played this game it was back in 2015 or so, the game was in Alpha (0.1.5), and it was a blast. Eight player, silly physics, a couple bugs that only enhanced the gameplay. The only problem was you needed a beefy computer to run certain maps like buoy, and that on the rare occasion a round would end prematurely when one but not all players died, but it didn't matter.I'm thankful as hell that I got a new computer around that time and was moving files around, because I discovered that the alpha version of gang beasts could be run on its own outside of steam without being updated, so I can still play the 0.1.5 alpha with my friends when we get together.Now you might be wondering, what could you do back in the alpha that you can't do now?To start, even though the characters felt more jiggly and silly, you also felt a lot more strength in your actions. With one hand you could hold on to just about anything, like holding on to the side of a truck, or holding the side of a ferris wheel and holding seven people below you over the water no problem. With this, you could climb in all sorts of places too with a bit of practice. Up, down and along walls, under platforms like on Gondola, up ropes and wherever you could get a hold of an object.Getting more to the jiggly and silly part of the characters, there was the ragdoll button or lay down button. Whatever it was supposed to be, it was hilarious. Holding it and moving around like a snake on the ground while your friends try to pick you off the floor before resorting to crawling like a snake as well, was fun. Being able to fall forward and do continuous front flips was hilarious, and managing to pull off a front flip between the two trucks on the trucks stage was so satsifying. Raising people hasn't changed too much I don't think, but it will always be great when you get a tower of people haphazardly perched over a cliff, or when you hold a pylon and lift it just right to super jump on the train stage.And those bugs I mentioned? It was one bug in particular really, was on the Gondola stage. If you broke off a part of the support cables into a little section and grabbed a hold of it, you could hold A to keep going up and fly around like you're on a broomstick (Which me and my friends dubbed the ""Hogwarts"" glitch). The most we managed to get flying on the same broom at once was three people on a large cable, and it ended with someone holding Y and the three of us rocketing to the ground screaming.The game now, although the physics of props and overall appearance are improved greatly, the gameplay itself feels worse. Basically, before you controlled characters that felt like they had a lot of muscle but no bones. Now it feels like you're controlling a wet pancake that can barely stand on its feet.I could go on about how fun this game was, but I feel like I've made my point. And you have to understand that I have more than 11 hours playing this game, because I've been playing the Alpha version that isn't linked to steam anymore.If you can get your hands on the old version, which is eight player, I say again, EIGHT PLAYER, get it.And to the developers if you happen to read this, your game is fun now too, but it's just not the same. I trust that in time you'll bring this game back to what it used to be, or at least make it better than the Alpha ever could have been, but for now I can't recommend this game.And for the love of god, bring back eight player multiplayer."

We played a little bit with the new physics before and it's just not that fun anymore. You get back up so early after getting knocked out. My friends and I used to almost choke from laughing.

Just be aware, some loading screens for multiplayer can take a while to load!I thought this would give Super Smash a good run for it's money as a PC version. Upon playing the game more, it's hard to say if I could even put it in that category. Gang Beasts is largely a physics based game with some interesting soft body physics. There are no real weapons but it seems like wrestling turned into a cartoon. At first glance, this game can get pretty intense but releasing it without multiplayer is sort of a risky gamble (check the discussions how many times multiplayer was asked about).This game is fun and has some seriously differentgameplay. The pretense behind the game as seen in the videos look awesome. I would consider the game to be a ""bash 'em-up"" sort that relies on luck a bit as well as your skill. As of now there are a few basic movements : punches, kicks, jump and crouch.  Each bumper (assuming you're using an xbox controller for pc - so ""RB"" and ""LB"") controls each individual arm. You can one-punch or two-punch opponents as you please. Holding the bumpers will make the player hold out their arms engaging them into a ""grab"" position. In this position, players may either grab onto a wall and begin climbing or grab onto another player. Grabbing onto an enemy and pressing ""Y"" will lift the enemy into the air. Careful though, the opponent can grab onto you too and attempt to lift you at the same time. When both players are engaged in grabs it can be difficult to maneuver the opponent where you want. This is where kicks, jump and even crouching come in to change the angles and give your advantage back. To climb a wall, the player has to play a little bit with the jump button and the grab buttons. Holding ""A"" will have your player sort of scoot up and prepare to launch themselves in the air to grab at a higher altitude. Being able to climb anything in the environment is a pretty cool feature to say the least. It does take some skill to get to where you want to be!The way to win the game is to eliminate the other opponents VIA throwing them off the map. The players can be thrown but a conscious player is difficult to pin. Throwing enough punches can knock a player out which makes it easier to get them over. Then, once the player is down and out, this opens an opportunity to throw the player over the edge. Button mashing ""A"" will wake your player up and may even give you a window to grab onto something and recover. Be careful though as you can knock yourself out! If by chance you hit your players head on something (either jumping or falling from a great distance), your player will become unconscious! The game itself now can be played with one keyboard or if your lucky, you'll have multiple controllers on hand to play with. Is it as fun as everyone writing in capitol letters says it is? Not to the extreme point of their bold letters. Up to 8 players can play at the same time and the more players you have, the more intense and enjoyable the game becomes. This is where multiplayer is crucial in this setting. It's nice to have local play but it's sort of difficult to fill 7 slots at all times you want to play.Thegraphicssuit the environment and tone the devs were trying to accomplish. The simplicity but attention to color and detail is what gives this game it's own character. The soft body physics, the light colors and the insane level designs is what adds an extra interest. The levels themselves are extremely fun to play in and diverse. The devs have taken to the forums and have asked players where they would like to fight their friends (a big + )! Some locations include levels that have grinding wheels in them, fighting on a billboard, on top crates suspended in mid air by a crane, in the artic, on moving trucks, a gyro level where fans can push or pull you and a classic ring. Thesoundshave improved since it's inception and there is even music added to some of the levels and the main menu. Players can hear other players laugh, get hit, get knocked out and even make noise when they're moving about or making a move. Both these realms have still ways to go but are definitely on the right track.Overall, the game is good, the concept is good and it seems like it can be extremely fun. It's fun for what is it now but isn't certainly worth the price unless you care about this game and hope the devs do. There is huge potential here. If the cards are played nicely I can see Fuzion Frenzy meeting Super Smashing Brothers. Hopefully some sort of mini-games get added be it objective focused or some sort of brawl. They have added a waves like game-mode just recently though! I'm hoping for more maps, detail, game modes, and especially party modes. I wouldn't mind seeing random objects added that players could pick up and possibly use. There is the ability to press (0-9) the numbers on the keyboard to spawn random objects with the click of the mouse. That's something!EARLY ACCESS RATING : 7.65/10 **as of Dec 2016GameplayBStory / CampaignN/AVisuals / User InterfaceBSounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityB-OverallB-edit 1 : xbox 360 controller works.edit 2 : logitech computer controller (wired) works for this game incase you don't have an xbox controller.edit 3 : PS3 controllers work as well (with certain programs/software).Video :Gang Beasts Highlight Review"

,Recommended,285900,22770053,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,Rick Grimes,"So I bought this game a while back and I've been playing it almost whenever a mate comes around from wherever the Hell they live and take a break from whatever the Hell they're doing. It's just occured to me that the only time I happen to actually care about what my mates are doing is when either it concerns me or it concerns something that may also happen to concern me. If I was any more uninvolved in what my friends were doing I'd be completely irrelevent to their daily lives. Like a small peice of chewing gum on a pavement somewhere. It also just occured to me that I'm an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so none of that matters so me anyway.Gang Beasts! Another excitingly simple game that was generated on IndieDB, which seems to be one of the hottest places to get indie games from. I suppose that Steam just starts selling whatever stiffens their willies, as a lot of the stuff from IndieDB seems to end up on Steam. Anyway, Gang Beasts is a arcadey, 3D fighting game in which players control questionably stable jelly babies as they brawl and fight for no apparent reason. It's like the whole premise of the game is a plot hole and the developer excuses this plot hole by saying ""because"" and then stops halfway as a hair gets caught up in the gears of his brain. But enough offensive jokes.One reason I probably enjoy Gang Beasts more than my other arcadey Steam games is that it's entertaining. Not just the sort of entertaining where writers stick Seth MacFarlane in a booth, get him drunk, then write down whatever offensive dialogue dribbles out of his♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm talking about that wonderful kind of entertainment that sort of comes naturally and sort of makes you queestion whether it was intentional or not. Like when a Micheal Bay movie actually does something good.The charming simplicity and art style of the game make it somewhat hilarious to watch the wobbling mutants flop about, throwing punches and making hysterical floppy laughing noises with their nonexistant mouths. That, of course, makes me further appreciate that the game is a multiplayer game! Yes, you can enjoy the wibbly wobbly laughing noises, not just alone, but with friends! Which also makes it ten times more fun as playing alone is sort of boring, unless of couse you've discovered how to use Dev mode, which, on this particular game, is about as much use as a knitted condom.I wouldn't say the game is perfect. The lack of online multiplayer makes multiplayer in general extremely hard. ""Yes, you and your mates can play this game together, but they have to drive down to wherever the ♥♥♥♥ you happen to live in order to do so"" Unless you live near your best mate, live near your Siblings r at least have a sex slave locked away in your basement, multiplayer can only be accomplished when the second, thid and fourth player are in the same room as you, playing on the same PC.Also, this game is buggy. Not just the sort of buggy where there's that one part of that one map where you can walk through a wall, but the sort of buggy where you look down to see that your leg is halfway up your♥♥♥♥♥♥buggy. The character models seem to have a feud underway with the laws of physics, as characters tend to just randomly dart in one direction, as if someone's just landed a roundhouse kick on their left testicle. Also, for some reason, the game doesn't seem to have a damage system at all, since you can be absolutely drilling at someone's head only for them to land a single headbutt and send you flying onto your backside.However, despite the game having more bugs than a Dog with worms, the charming way in which the game is styled makes me unable to refuse its' shiny, colourful, seizure-inducing fun that I get from playing it. If I was going to say anything about this game, I'd say it's probably better to approach it as someone who's played many Indie games before. It's seemingly the embodyment of what we expect from Indie games. It's simple, it's funny, it's cute and it has about as much potential as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with worms. It may be shiny and it may LOOK good, but once you're inside it you can practically sense the bugs. And, yes, I was going for offensive that time."

I'm sure it's still fun to beat up your friends as they die in hilariously dangerous ways, but until waves is back in I will keep a negative review about it. they also need to improve online matchmaking so you can host private servers and play with your friends without having to ride over to their house just to play a couple rounds with them."

The latest patch has totally changed the pacing of the game. The score screens between each round really drag the game out. Something changed with the fighting mechanics that makes it less hilarious and fun. The music almost seems too serious/actiony for what I viewed as a fun/funny game. It appears the devs had a different vision for the game than what I had when I bought it.

It used to have incredibly overexgarrated lighting effects which made it unique and great to look at it. Not anymore.There's plenty more to complains about, the big other being they reworked the previously fun levels to be drab and boring.  The menus also fail to work properly with a controller anymore (can't change resolution without keyboard/mouse).Finally, a message to the devs - PLEASE ROLLBACK THIS GAME TO THE STATE IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO.  Amazing game, my profile says 21 hours for some reason - I've definitely spent hundreds.  But won't be playing it unless I can find some older version of the game elsewhere."

I WANT TO SAVE YOU MONEY!!As much as I love the game, and don't regret all the hours I put into it, I just can't recommend it... Heres why:The Developers do not care or listen to the community, this is obvious considering the reviews, they mainly... and rarely, update the game just to try and hold on to the dying community.They flip and flop between different styles of gameplay, usually changed by Changing the pace of gameplay, changing parts of maps that shouldnt've been changed, different rules that werent needed to be changed. Etc.And Overall the development process, Most of the game changing updates were changed just for fun it seems like, everything was changed on the spot and were completely rushed into patches, with no explanation or fair reason to change said mechanics. Such as the combat pacing severely watered down and weak, unnecessarily long get-up times when knocked out, and the unneeded map changes no one asked for. Also can we NOT FORGET that no matter what server you join, there are insane amounts of input lag and ping issues, even when joining a server close to your location.And PLEASE, Do not let the trailer fool you, the gameplay in the trailer is so misleading and is COMPLETELY different from the game when you play it.As this review is written I suggest not wasting any money on the game, even on sale, until they revert all the poor changes made to the game, I will change the review when that happens. But as it stands it seems like they gave up on the game and they simply do not care if it gets poorly reviewed by the community."

Not to mention adding like 2 seconds to the already 2 second input delay. You used to just go crazy when fighting your friends. Now in order to punch correctly you have to space out your attacks which makes punching just feel like you are lightly tapping them. Removed custom servers so now you HAVE to play with 8 players, for me and my friends that is 5 random people. Basically turned fun goofy party game with friends into lame not fun matchmaking game.

So essentially unplayable in my case (unlike the previous free versions which are great).Also, after playing for a few minutes the actual game seems like a step back. Jumping and punching is so very unfluid and slow. Unlike the flips and overhead punches I was used to delivering I realized I was restricted to unresponsive arms moving in the direction of another character with no satisfying result.When they fix the controls I'm sure it will be great, but because I was expecting a £12 game to be improved from the free version and was surprised to find it in it's current state in my opinion this game gets a full 0/10 compared to the free, better build.Full recommendation of the free version, no recommendation of this unimpressive costume simulator rubbish."

Watching Naked people is better than it has ever been!But this game again needs some improvement. The game lacks a great singleplayer, you can pick a map and spawn in a ton of CPUs and fight, but what I would love to see is a couple featured map and a Team deathmatch, where you pick the amount of CPUs you want to fight with you (They will be the same color as your character) and then pick the amount of enemies. Then add maps for this specific game-type, so longer maps that have proper details and fetures to feel like a proper tdm. Also, a multiplayer would be fantastic (Pretty sure this will be added in the future) being able to go online searching for opponents and picking a specific game-type to play, then battling to the death with friends    would be great and more fun then ever, makiing this game a even more popular and fun game then right now!

,Recommended,285900,18342485,"Posted: 5 October, 2015",all,mrcraggle,"I originally discovered this game through Giant Bomb, the same way I'm sure thousands of others did too. This was back in early 2014 and back then the game had a few sandbox levels, a small single player level with bots and the typical stages we all know such as ring and trucks. Then things went very quiet for a long time after the release of 0.0.3 in April 2014 until the game was reworked and released on Steam in Early Access. As it turned out, the release turned out to be quite disappointing for a long of people as it was missing a lot of content the game previously had such as the sandbox levels which to this day have yet to make a return.It's difficult to review Gang Beasts for what it currently is and what it can and should be. There have been a ton of delays and the devs have been radio silent at times which hasn't helped matters either. What I can say is that the actual part of playing Gang Beasts is incredible. It's some of the most fun you can have. Should it have online multiplayer? Probably but only to satisfy those that keep complaining about it. Local multiplayer games have been seeing a resurgence as of late and Gang Beasts is a shining example among them. Sitting around and playing on a large TV with a group of friends and trash talking each other in a way that often reminds me of playing Smash Bros. Melee on the GameCube. By just playing the game online misses out a core piece of why the game is so fun. Being in a room of others really adds to the enjoyment. If the game does get online multiplayer, that's totally awesome too and would benefit 99% of how people play games nowadays but do yourself a favour and at least try to play it with others in person, it's a blast.If you're on the fence or simply know you can't play locally, this is one you're either going to continue to wait on or avoid. The game has bots but no real single player to speak either but the devs do intend to add a old-school style beat em up into the game at some point."

I have played it with a friend and we got in a server after 5/10 min we both crash just for no reason. I do not even recommend playing this with more than 6 people because you can not even find a server orCREATEone (They should really let us create private servers/servers)- Bugs: Your body parts fly sometimes around when you're throw against a train for example but also for some no appear reason.

It also contains plenty of levels to play with destructable areas to make it a but more fun and also has different outfits for characters which can be fun to use for instance the cape adds another way a player can get you. Detail has been placed into the game which is good.ConsThe unstable version of the game is more stable than the main game itself..........The game also does not include anyway to edit controls and does not show what controls do what which really is not helpful. Also noticed players seem to have a lot of connection issues and trying to set up your on dedicated server is also a pain to do. Inside the game their is countless bugs(Some make it more interesting)such as glitching models, players being hit so hard the model breaks sometimes even getting them stuck into places where they cant lose. The content in general of the game lacks they are currently focusing in areas which they dont need too.The games kinda like marmite you either love it or hate it."

One level (the one with the 2 elevators) even dips to single frames sometimes. I played this a year ago or so locally on a friend's much lesser computer and it used to work just fine. I cannot imagine what could have happened to make the game perform so horribly right now.It also feels like the physics are a lot worse than they used to be. They used to feel fluid and a lot of fun, but now it feels laggy and weird. They also changed a few of the levels to be different, namely the elevator level seems to kill you after enough time now, and the Sausage Factory level has one less floor than it used to have. (Actually, the old version of the Sausage level is in the picture here on Steam! That is basically false advertising by that point, since the level does *not* look like that anymore. And that version was so much better than the new one.)Maybe there are other changes too, but I was so disappointed in what this game turned into since I last played it that I stopped after 45 minutes and asked for a refund.I'll check this game out again in a year or two and see if they have managed to make it good again. What a shame. This used to be such a fun game with so much promise. They actually made it worse over all this time."

Well we learned the fastest way to get ran over by a train after  knocking yourself from falling 12 feet up a nearby pole... Oops lol XDMy favorite map is Trucks, which is one of the smallest maps in Gang Beasts, but it offers a interesting survival point, where you riding on top of two panel trucks and dodging incoming highway sighs.The best part about this game is it's wacky physics and endless gameplay possibilities. You can break the cables on a elevator or scaffolding and watch your friends fall to the ground. you can rock the blimp back and forth and see how long it takes to make friends fall off. And my always favorite thing to do, is jumping inside my friend's cart on Wheel stage and throw them out of it, like a game of ""King of the hill"".This game gets 10/10 stars overall"

Even though there are still a few glitches in this spectacular game, the glitches just make this game even MORE hilariouis! There's a glitch were sometimes, your avatar might get stuck in a spot or corner right when they died, and their body might stretch frantically across the screen everywhere, creating a funny effect! My only problem with this game is that the community servers are not working properly, so you you can only play this game  with a friend in L.A.N. I know this game is still in Early access, I don't blame it, since It did say say a few stuff wouldn't work properly in the title screen. It's alright. I love this game because you can create your own custom character and just fight with (almost) anyone! The taunt and pucnhing and kicking animations are cool, too.  Also, not only does this game provide a HUGE variety of fighting arenas and maps, the maps themselves are just incredible, and they are really fun because they're so hard to fight on! But I think I would only reccomend this game to people who have at least one experience playing fighting games, such as Street Fighter, Tekken, or Super Smash Bros. The whole reason I joined Steam was to download this game and play it!

The sight of your friend holding a heap of meat above his head and charging towards you, or dragging that friend by the back of the head to an insanely perilous drop off of a power plant chimney, or both of you being thrown, unconscious, into a meat grinder can create laughs for both those involved and those watching.

,Not Recommended,285900,28957938,Posted: 2 January,all,El_Buhdai,"Ok first let me tell you that this is one of the most fun(ny) and unique multiplayer games I've played in a long time. There are a lot of crazy and random things that can happen in this game and they can create some really tense and epic moments. Here is the problem I have with this game though:It's broken. Let me tell you that I've invested in many Early Access, Alpha, and Beta titles on Steam and abroad. I can handle constant crashes, gamebreaking glitches, and just about anything you can throw at me as long as I can at least PLAY your game. However, this game is brokenbeyond the level which is acceptable even for an Alpha game, so buggy that I don't think it should be for sale yet.Well, mostly multiplayer. Of course you have your standard Alpha game issues across the board. Your crashes, infinite loading screens, physics glitches (which are actually more funny than anything, even if they cause you to lose a match), and the works. Here was the final nail in the coffin that caused me to leave this game a negative review.A friend and I, excited to play this extremely funny fighting game, hopped into a ""party"" together. I searched for a match. Most servers were either full or had 7 of 8 slots filled.{- Problem #1: Not enough servers for players in the US.}By chance, within a few minutes, a server in our area (I live in Georgia, she lives in Texas) with 6/8 players opened up. I quickly jumped on the opportunity to snatch it up for my friend and I. I got in! I search among the heads in the game and press the button that shows the name tags and she's nowhere to be found. ""Did you get in?"" I asked her. She said no. I quit and return to the lobby.{- Problem #2: Buggy party and matchmaking systems}I try several more times and one of 4 things happenedevery time:1. ""Could not connect to server"", despite the fact that there were already people on it.2. One of our games crashes3. We get to the loading screen, but it's one of those infinite loading screens (I had a few of these before I tried to play with her so I knew how to identify them).4. The server somehow filled up while we were connecting.{Problem #3: No private matches, or starting your own server lobbies through peer-to-peer that other people can join later.} <-- You can host your own server, but I was sure my wifi was not strong enough to host for this game, especially not the week I wrote this.5. It was a bugged server for players in the US that offered no information about itself in the server browser. These are typically incredibly laggy and have bots on them for some reason.. I think. Note: I was making sure to disable unofficial servers each time I searched.{- Problem #4: See #1 PLUS, Not enough WORKING servers for players in the US}We spent the better part of an hour trying to find a game, and it never happened. If you have a brother or sister, or some friends and people with Xbox Controllers to screw around with in person, you can play it. However, as of now, you can forget about playing with your Steam friends. Even if you're just looking at it to mostly play Local multiplayer, don't buy the game. Not yet. The developers seem to be pretty active, updating the game regularly and quickly when severe issues make themselves present. Get it when it's stable enough to play, or at release. Let us early adopters handle this bad boy for now and take all the anger and frustration for you.EDIT: I tried this again later with a friend I met in the game who added me randomly but the whole time, my hopes were low. That time, we got into a server but of course it was laggy and the action would freeze and resume every second like clockwork. We left that server because the experience was terrible, and were never able to find another server since. What's ironic is that maybe 10 - 15 minutes after the guy added me, my game crashed. My first thought was ""Welp, that guy was cool, too bad I'll never be able to play with him again!"", then I chuckled to myself the way a hyper-masculine dad would who's tried for all his son's life to get his son into sports, only for the son to tell him he's gay and wants to sing for a living.To the developers, if you're reading this: Please, PLEASE prioritize fixing the almost unplayable online multiplayer over all other things for the time being. We can't playtest the game if we can'tplaythe game.Don't make the same mistake I did by seeing these issues all over the reviews section and believing they won't happen to you. They will. Just wait until the multiplayer reaches an acceptable level of stability. When that happens, I will absolutely change my review, because if it weren't for those issues, I would completely recommend this game."

We can play over at his place any time, and it's still great fun. Me, him, and some friends of ours have been following GB since fairly early stages, and while we really fell in love with this game in one of it's beta stages, we still think the overall end result is headed in the same direction as it was before, but has implemented a lot of features we don't necessarily agree with. So far, we don't really like the fight mechanic changes, like at all, but we've gotten used to them. The run feature is decent, but the way they changed how you fight, and the mechanics, it's really not as user friendly as it once was. You could hop in cold waters and play this no problem before, now it's a bit more of a pain, but still managable. And now, people get knocked out a lot easier. We like the costumes option, that's one new feature we all genuinely love and enjoy. The new maps are nice, but we would like the option to play the originalandnew versions of the older maps that have been around since beta. The online community seemsfairlydead; I'm sure most people got GB for couch co-op anyway, but it would be nice to find more players online. The game seems much more stable now, but still needs some improvement as a whole.  Overall, if you've got friends to play with, and your pc can handle GB, it's well worth the purchase.TL;DR>had a history with GB>finally purchased the real version and ditched the betas/alphas>my pc can't handle GB, but I gameshare with my bro, that's why I have low playtime in GB>notice a lot of change from betas/alphas to it's current state>they've changed some gameplay mechanics that were probably better left untouched>they've also added new maps/features>added custom costumes>added a gametype or two>also changed some old maps up a bit>with new gameplay mechanic changes it's a bit harder to play>you also get knocked out a LOT easier>great for couch co-op>great for online multiplayer, however online community is largely nonexistent>single player features are rather drab>but as long as you've got friends and your pc can handle GB, it's a worthy investment.>the game is early access, so there may be a price hike (like with Ark for example,) so you may want to purchase before it is out of E/A stagesPros:-fun-visually decent (getting better but still average)-plays well-multiplayer (that's where the real fun is)-couch co-op/online multiplayer-countless laughs will be generated from GB (at least when you play with friends)-high replayability (again, multiplayer)-custom outfits-early access, which means there's only more to come to the GB universeCons:-not many players online-they've changed some core mechanics that aren't necessarily changed for the better-fairly demandingSO MAKE SURE YOUR PC CAN HANDLE B4 PURCHASING-early access.. While good, it's also somewhat bad. The game still needs some improvement.-no achievements-no trading cards"

It wasn't until December that they added new features like online multiplayer and customization. I feel like it has the potential to be so much more, especially after playing Human Fall Flat (another similar game but with puzzle solving teamwork) It makes me wish it had obstacle courses and stages that required teamwork and goals to achieve to give it some variation. Also it gets updated extremely slow so just keep that in mind, they showed a teaser of a new Soccer game mode at E3 2016 that still isn't in yet.Aside from that it was definetly worth it!

Controls are strange to change since you cant bind to the mouse but the default controls use the mouse.To move wasd, to grab hold LMB and RMB, to punch click LMB or RMB, when grabbing to lift hold shift, to crawl hold ctrl, tap control to headbutt, to see player names its q, to jump its space, its supposed to be e to kick but instead its m, to switch spectators its < and > next to m, to wake up spam space(i think spamming all buttons makes it faster idk), to knock people out faster and harder i think its more efficient punching and headbutting at the same time and it aims at the direction your character moves not where your mouse cursor is, if you hold down m it does a similar crawl like ctrl, some combos are jumping and ctrl(to headbutt), and jumping and m(to dive kick), climbing is weird yet makes sense similar to mount your friends, you grab on to your surface(hold down LMB and RMB) while holding space then let go of one hand(either or) and wait till your body lifts up a little then hold down LMB or RMB(the hand you let go) and grab on higher up then let go of the lower hand and(still holding space) lift the lower hand higher up the wall and grab then repeat, im not sure yet how to go sideways while climbing but i know you can swing yourself(btw you will let go after a while when you lose grip), to run hold down space, and momentum makes a difference in damage and distance you throw(headshots do the most damage), to lift your arms in the air(taunt) hold shift without grabbing anybody, idk how to make sounds yet but i think it happens automatically depending on your situtation. Hope this helps, thanks for reading."
,Recommended,285900,35205339,Posted: 25 September,all,Bung Fu Master,"Gang Beasts is a bit love/hate for me. I really enjoy playing it with friends and it has had me in tears laughing at some of the onscreen antics. The physics are a lot more clever than they look - it seems that every time I play it my character pulls off a dodgy move I've never seen before and it's hilarious.With recent updates, they have focussed on tweaking the physics to be a bit more consistent and less down to pot luck, which is much appreciated. Also, adding 'throwing' when you drop a person was a genius move! The game is as pretty as it needs to be and actually the new 'on demand' server setup seems to be working a lot better than the old system - I can actually find a game now.Now the bad... This is a game that gets a lot of the very difficult things so right and some of the simplest things completely wrong. The game is now on its 3rd iteration of menus and they are still barely usable. How on earth is it SO DIFFICULT to make a coherent menu system for a game? C'mon guys, it's been like this for over a year. The game is still riddled with bugs at certain points that will make the servers start the next level while still showing the scores while you play behind them, then suddenly decide it's going to skip this level and move everyone to another. This type of thing should be really simple to fix compared to some of the other things (e.g. perfectly synchronised ragdoll physics over the network) that it does so well. With a bit of a polish (and no, I don't mean slightly tweaking the menus that are there, I mean COMPLETELY BINNING THEM AND STARTING AGAIN), this game would feel far more complete. Another thing is that the available levels in online keeps changing - some of my favourite levels (Subway) seem to have gone missing. Whilst 'new' (read: singleplayer) levels have appeared in multiplayer, some of the classics have disappeared for no apparent reason - they seemed to be working?! Maybe now would be a great time to add some new levels too?I'm recommending this game because of all the amazing laughs I've had playing it. Everyone here should try and look past the ABYSMAL menus / polish and enjoy the ragdoll fighting at its finest!"

,Not Recommended,285900,35245835,Posted: 27 September,all,Captain Winston,"The 6.0 build has made some things much better, but broke the most basic part of the game, the combat. It used to be that you would engage in a fight with someone and actually maneuver and aim various moves and positions. Once knocked out it was fairly simple to get back up at first giving you plenty of time to keep a fight going, and as the fight progresses it became harder and harder to wake up as fast. Now once you're out, you're just ♥♥♥♥ing out until at least 8-10 seconds later. This gives anyone still conscious an insane amount of time to do whatever they want, which is usually a mad rush to get a ringout. There aren't really fights anymore in this game. It's whoever gets the first no aim punch who will typically win now. Not only that but the game seems to punish more mobile players now. My favorite way to fight before this patch was to swing my body around off of other players and the environment to build momentum and clobber people from above. Any time I try this now I either get knocked out instantly by a random punch, or just fall unconcious for no reason as I build speed.These two changes have absolutely crippled my enjoymend of the game and I will not be streaming it anymore until my method of play becomes viable again."

You'll work out how to perform a dropkick without doing a backflip and falling on your head, knocking yourself out in the process.You'll learn how to grab people you actually aim at, rather than latching onto a piece of wall and spending 10 seconds trying to pull away from the wall you're holding onto.You'll learn how to climb up from a ledge. You'll scale walls and manage to perform comebacks from situations you initially thought to be a certain losing condition.You MIGHT even learn how to throw a diving headbutt without missing and flinging yourself off the arena.You'll still feel as though the game is borderling impossible to control, but the fact of the matter is, at that point it'll beabsolutely hilariousto try and get your character to do what you want, and watch others try and do the same.To go a little more in-depth, this is how Gang Beasts' control scheme breaks down.You got two buttons for punching, one for the left hand, one for the right. If you hold one button, you grab onto an enemy, or a piece of environment.You got a jump button. Holding it down will make your character run.You got a duck button. Holding it down will make your character fall over forwards, tapping it will cause your character to smack his head violently towards the nearest enemy.You have a kick button. Tapping it will make your characters adorable little feet nudge towards the nearest enemy, holding it will cause your character to fall over backwards.And you have a button to lift your arms over your head in triumph.There are no predetermined animations for most of those actions; punches are really just ""tell your character to flap their arm towards the nearest enemy"". If you hit the headbutt-on (pardon the pun) your character might, for example, perform it backwards if the nearest enemy is behind you. So, physics does play a large part in how the game is played and how it's fights play out.Punches, kicks and headbutts can, if they hit the right spot, knock an enemy out, leaving them ragdolled and vulnerable to be thrown out of the ring for a few seconds.It sounds simple at first and you'll think ""Why would I want to lay back down? Sounds useless."", until you realise you might want to jump before pressing the kick-button, which causes your character to lean back mid-air - essentially performing a drop kick. Raising your arms sounds useless for a second until you realise you can grab enemies, and the only winning condition is to throw someone out of the ring - then you put 2 and 2 together and realize you can lift enemies over your head.When it hits the point of you having a grasp of the controls, you'll learn how to apply them properly, and then the game's ridiculous combat will begin to really shine. Multiplayer is a bit rough, but extremely fun. The game cycles through a variety of arenas, each adding their own little flavor to the already chaotic combat, such as fighting on top of moving trucks, on slippery pieces of ice that shift if more weight is on one side, swaying containers over the oceans with cables you can tear through to cause the containers to plummet down, or a blimp, whichs round shape proves to be the greatest risk of the map; there's also a good ol' wrestling ring where the deathmatch-style melee combat can commence without having to worry about any environmental hazards. Just plain old brawling.Combat tends to be incredibly hectic, fast-paced, and it rarely outstays it's welcome. The exception being situations where everyone dies, and the last two players duke it out in a lengthy duel, but I rarely had a match that lasted longer than 5 minutes at a time.Each round in multiplayer gets you paired up with a certain amount of players, 5 - 8 tends to be my experience. It goes on until a single player has won 4 matches. Then there's a bit of confetti, and a new round starts; But honestly, I couldn't care less about who wins.This game is all about having fun. It's a hilariously dumb premise, it looks amusingly stupid, and the combat is so incredibly uncontrolled and hectic that it can only be described as ""chaotically brilliant"".The screenshots displayed on steam are outdated; the graphics and physics system have been reworked and the balancing has been adjusted a lot. The game is far from perfect, of course. It is pretty rough around the edges, and if you want competitive brawling and tactical fights, this game might be the one for you - but if you want that, you might want to look at games whose cast doesn't consist of playdoh-y men making ""Huhuhu~""-noises as they beat each other up and fling themselves off of gondolas when missing a dropkick. On a sidenote: It has a character creation, and you can put clothes on your lumpy clayman.I also have no idea why it's called Gang Beasts, but if you play with your friends, you COULD for example wear similar outfits and PRETEND to be a gang.I recommend the classic ""leather jacket and aviator sunglasses""-look, personally."

,Recommended,285900,14614014,"Posted: 23 February, 2015",all,Grizzly,"Right off the bat, I'll say that this game isn't worth it if you can't play with a friend. There is still about 4 hours fun in singleplayer, just spawning in enemy AI and attacking it, and the combat is extremely satisfying, but you'll end up getting bored quickly if you plan on playing by yourself.That being said, with friends, this is THE party game. Not only is it fun, but thrilling, unpredictable fun. Unpredictable in the sense that this game will constantly take you by surprise, whether that surprise comes in the form of your unconscious friend regaining consciousness and suddenly uppercutting you into a pit of fire, or with you accidentally sparta-kicking your friend through a pane of glass on an elevator, there's a lot of sudden surprises.In Gang Beasts, you're in complete control. Every move your character makes is a result of your actions, and combat isn't just built on static animations. You get real satisfaction knowing that you finally uppercutted someone off the side of a moving truck without the aid of a quicktime event or a static animation to do it for you.Not only does this game have brilliant combat, but also brilliant parkour. Dare I say it, but Gang Beasts almost rivals Grow Home for parkour. Between climbing to safety on a dangling window cleaning platform while your persistent friend tries to break the only cable still holding said platform, to swinging through an elevator window and doing a falied backflip before concussing yourself on the floor, it is very responsive and leaves you drastically clutching your controller.The downsides, of course, are the lack of online multiplayer and mod support. Not even full blown mod support, but just the ability to make your own levels. Online multiplayer speaks for itself. With that, you could discredit my entire spiel about the singleplayer part of this game.So, if you enjoy fighting games and party games, GET THIS. Of course, there is a bit of a technical side involved with hooking up controllers and such, but once you sort it out, you've got a flawless party game that'll keep you satisfied for hours on end."

It is so random, I usually try to use the region filter and if servers are coming up it usually works but half the time they do not come up and no matter how long I wait and how much I fiddle with the region filter it doesnt detect any servers. Sometimes messing around with the region filter will find servers but that hardly ever happens and is really frustrating when you want to play with a freind and there are no servers. Honestly this is just another game releasing too early in this case releasing its online too early. I really want it to be good and fixed in the future because the game is generally a lot of fun to play with freinds. Seeing as the online just came out im sure the developers will patch up their menu to make it a lot less buggy. The only other problem I have with the game is that when I bind my controller to the game, jumping seems to come quite late which as you can imagine is quite annoying.

It used to be that you could punch someone enough to stun them for a bit, which gave you a chance to pick them up and throw them.  That didn't seem to happen anymore - our most defensive player would just run away, never really getting into trouble.  The game doesn't seem to rotate through maps anymore - which is what I thought the ""random"" option was for.  You can still fall to the ground, but you can't move anymore when you do it, which was one of the very weird and endearing features.I really liked this game at indiecade, and I'm disappointed that I haven't ever gotten that version of the game."

However, the incompetence of the devs has ruined what this game tries to accomplish. Gang Beasts is an excellent example of my issues with Steam's Early Access program.Boneloaf seems to work at their own (slow) pace. Take a look at the release date of this game. Very few meaningful game features have been added since release. There is a character customization system (which removes some of the more interesting and fun character models). There is an online multiplayer system (which seems to be incredibly broken at the time of this writing). Most maps have been nerfed (looking at you, buoy).I'd love to enjoy this game more if Boneloaf would just implement finished maps and features. An early warning sign of this game's tumultuous development would have been the announcement of a PS4 version back in 2014...which still has yet to be released. I'd advise everyone reading this review to wait until this game has exited Early Access and taken on a more competent development track."

I don't completely hate this game. I love the art style, the game looks amazing lets just get that out of the way. And the game functions just fine for me but, in most other aspects the game is just disappointing.The gameplay itself just doens't work for me. The controls are decent but nothing has any weight to it. I get that that is the point but to quote the immortal yatzhee ""THEN WHY AREN'T I LAUGHING?"" I admit that it's funny for a little while but it just lost me along the way.Also a major focus of the game is the multiplayer. I'm not really much of a multiplayer guy, but I do indulge in the pleasures of multiplayer now and again. But the problem is that this game is made for local multiplayer, and if you're like me then you just don't have the ability to get a bunch a friends over to play. So naturally there's online multiplayer right? Right?Wrong.The online multiplayer is still a work in progress and barely anyone has access to it. Adding the multiplayer would make this game INFINITELY more replayable, but so far there's just no incentive for people like me to play.Also the player vs. npc mode has a single map to play on and it is easily the most boring map in the game.I don't like this game and don't recommend this game in its current state but you should DEFINITELY keep an eye on it because it has so much potential and can only get better from here. I'll definitely buy the game again when online modes are added but until then, keep the 20 dollars and use it to buy other complete games like Shovel Knight, or Dust: An Elysian Tail which are complete and well worth your money."

Gently stir this mixture into dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten flour; don't worry about a few lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk.Step 2Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When butter foam subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or skillet, making pancakes of any size you like. Adjust heat as necessary; usually, first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches. Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, after 2 to 4 minutes.Step 3Cook until second side is lightly browned.

There are no advanced modes (tournament, etc.) and the UI of the game is very lacking. There currently is not even a visible ""lives"" counter, so while in the match it's very hard to see who is winning.  Also there a couple of baffling design decisions like the ""Start""-button on a controller ending the current game session and sending you back to main menu.The core game itself seems fairly finished though, I didn't encounter any major bugs or stability issues.The strangest thing however is that the game had nearly the same feature set when I saw it the first time roughly 1.5 years ago on a stream. So I wonder what the full release will look like when it comes out within the next half year.I still DO recommend the game at this point if you regularly have other people to play with.If not, wait for the full release."

The costumes and maps are awesome, although there needs to be ALL of the maps available. I hope you have a copy of the original physics coding cause my advice is to go back to the original physics, and keep costumes and the current layout. Basically, don't change anything except the physics. Also it is WAY to easy to get knocked out. Even landing on my feet I knocked MYSELF out.

Its also the same♥♥♥♥♥♥for walking and climbing (which by the way climbing was also thoroughly ♥♥♥♥ed)The combat is so ♥♥♥♥ing trash now that I refuse to play the game. You can knock a guy over like 7 times and he'll get up after like 3 seconds. Its so dumb and ridiculous that this tiny feature just makes the game unplayable since its just a bunch of random punching until randomly one of you decides not to wake up.Also just a tiny problem, what the ♥♥♥♥ is that point screen? ♥♥♥♥ing balloons? I don't even get it. its like random♥♥♥♥♥inflatable balloons of the characters faces for some reason and one of them gets a lil gold star (also a balloon) if they won. Its so ugly and just would have been better if they just kept it like they last had it.TLDR; Don't buy the game.

,Recommended,285900,33778916,Posted: 24 July,all,The Entire Population of Israel,"PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This game is fun, unique, and all around a wonderful piece of art.The problem is, the game is still in Early Access. Really early access.The game is buggy, glitchy, and with almost every update, it gets worse.The online can be confusing, and sometimes the game just doesn't work. The gameis so jam packed with bull crap glitches, it is often unplayable. Personally, Ioften find the bugs mostly humerous where it glitches someone across space-timeand sends them back, or you feel bs'd by it killing you. If you get angry or yourfriends do, maybe wait a year or just wait until it's released. This can really makeor break the game for a person, and the price is really high. If you plan on gettingit, i'd reccomend waiting for it to be on sale. It's always on sale when the sales aregoing on, and there is nothing more saddening than seeing a game you wanted and waitedto get on sale, only to find out it didn't participate. But anyway, Like I said, glitchygame, early access, doesn't work sometimes, real pain. This The only reason I am writinga positive review is just how fun he game really is. It is so much fun to just see these colorfullittle mumbling clay figures duke it out with silly sounds and stupid gameplay, and even more sowhen you have a buddy. The local multiplayer is really good, online is getting there. For privateservers you need hamachi, and download a tool in the Steam Library folder. (Don't worry, it's free.)TL;DR The game is really good but crazy buggy and often doesn't work. Online can be a pain but local is good. Not veryfun without friends. Prolly best to wait until released if that bugs you. (get it? :P)"

But I cannot recomnmend it - the game I bought is obviously not the one from the trailers.- no online multiplayer - unless someone is sitting next hacking on the same keyboard you are single player  only- yes, ""local-coop only"" was writen on the shop-page. But where is the point in having up to eight players fighting? 8 ppl on my keyboard? Even if each had a XBOX-Controller and I somehow had wired them all to my PC....- AI levels are missing - so no point in playing single player anymore unless you like puching motionless enemies- no controls menu (going through all the keys on your keyboard in order to find out the controls feels like C64)- bad lags in some levels (grinding and fire is not possible to play) - even on the lowest qualitySo maybe this is ""early alpha"" stage and maybe when they add online MP option it starts making senseBut right now one feels cheated buying it as the game has nothing to do with what is shown in the trailers.This is sad!

I invited some friends over we played it all night long. It was fun(ny) as hell and I was telling my Friends that the game is still in development so we started to eagerly speculate about all the features that moght be added to the game soon (maybe even the planned ""co-op campaign"" mode)!Just recently, we were sitting on the couch again and we tried out Gang Beasts (again) - but the disappointment was huge. Framerate drops, many more glitches, worse controls(?), not a single new feature. Yes, we were playing the beta branch, which was probably our mistake, but still: Not a single new feature.Yes, they added an online mode, but I am obviously one of the very few players that thinks that not every f****** game needs an online mode. Gang Beast's short description in Steam is still ""Gang Beasts is a silly local multiplayer party game..."" - and that's what the game was designed for in the first place! ""Party game"" means that you can play it with some friends in the same room, while drinking a beer or two (or eight), yell and laugh at each other. I don't understand why people need to play it online with people they don't see or even know. It takes away 90% of the fun. I love online games in general, but I just think that some games (including this one) are meant to be played on a single screen with your friends beside you.Another thing most people don't consider/know is that a network implementation often requires streamlining core features, especially physics related ones (in order to keep the network traffic -> latency low). In a physics based game, this might be very hard to pull off or require core mechanics to be simplified.The outcome of the decision to implement online multiplayer is that we now have a core game that is more buggy than a year ago with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, broken online multiplayer mode. If players wouldn't have begged for online multiplayer, we maybe would have had a solid core game with more maps, modes, features, and maybe even the planned co-op campaign mode by now!With the pace and direction the development process is heading, I've lost my faith in Gang Beasts. I also don't recommend the game at its current state and price."

I think it is entirely worth the price of the game for some laughs and funny  seemingly-drunken fighting.The one thing that I do wonder is why the Dev's don't seem to be taking more advantage of what they have here? I feel as though they should be consistently adding maps (contact me if you have a shortage of map ideas Devs) and attempting to get this game out on consoles ASAP because it would thrive there. You have the game , the phyics are hilarious an work very well in my opinion, so just start adding content (maps, clothing , game modes, etc?) to keep it feeling fresh. It really is limitless with how this game is.To any developers of this game, please, make use of what you have here. Start adding some goofy capture the flag mode or a new map every so often. This game shoul be on fire right now but I see a plethora of negative reviews and the only reasoning I can find is perhaps the lack of content because the game itself is great for laughs."

They are pretty much funny and make you fall on the ground, laughing, without even stopping. I never did experience a bug, but, I know I will die laughing when I do see a bug.This Review Is Short, but, here's some bonus content to let you know more about the game.You can play the game offline, or with friends, or with other people. Or you can play with your friend in your house. You can grab, punch, do cool moves, climb, and everything. you can even spawn stuff when you play offline (Maybe this was removed, I dont know). I honestly die everytime, but, you'll get used to it."

Now you forced to tell some friends to BUY it or get it on a bunch of other home computors and laptops.I know I only have like ten minutes in to the game but thats because I had no one to play it with.

The idea of some crazed drunken blobs trying to kick each other out of a ring, is kinda fun. I love local multi-player games like this.Alas so much seems broken, like some occasional crashes, the fact that pausing the game quits it, which can be turned off from the menu (something not right here), which occaisonally (the menu) doesn't work using a control pad. The wave mode sometimes refuses to spawn enemies and there are the odd pauses during gameplay that are unexplained, also the fact you can get lost behind scenary never to be seen. The controls are limited and it is mostly about spamming the buttons to knock someone out, and then lob them out of the arena. And let's be honest here, the controls are unweildy to say the least. Admittedly you do get better through-trial and error and by doing a bit of research, but dear lord is it unpredictable to say the least.I realise it's early acess and I wish I could bring myself to dedicate more time to it, but whenever me and friends come back to give this game a go there are silly issues that stop us enjoying it, and it never seems to be evolving after all this time. This game has one trick up it's sleeve and that trick is getting old already.To summarise: A fun idea that is great for a while but flawed in its execution. I hope it grows into something more substantial and gets the polish it deserves. I live in hope."

The original game was amazing, and it was a blast to play (thats where most of my hours with my friends were clocked). But now, they have changed too much. The climbing used to be one of the best parts about this game, but since its release, it has fallen down hill. I remeber climbing away from my friends so they would have to get me, and it would lead into a wacky climbing/fighting challenge. Also, the maps now aren't as good as they used to be, and some maps didn't even look close to some of the cool concept drawings they had. I miss the old Gang Beasts, I miss the laughs, and the silly physics, and the hilarious climbing. Please Double Fine, bring back what made this game good, I want to play with my friends more, but they agree too that this game has gone down hill. I will change this when the game returns to its roots, but developers don't usually listen to their fans, so this review probably wont change. And it's a sad reality to think about. Most developers need to listen to the community they have created, and create a game that the devs and the fans can both look up to and appreciate. Sadly, I rarely see game devs doing this. This little review might not have much of an impact, but there is always a chance that someone that reads this can actually do something about this problem."

Although that isn't the whole premise of the game, it does invole that. It is a hilariously great game and will give you such a great time. The sad thing about it is that it is only LOCAL multiplayer. No online or computer players (although the developers are working on that) In the meantime, while you wait for that online multiplayer, you could always buy this and get some friends so you can;Punch eachother, kick eachother, grab eachother, throw eachother, drop eachother, KO eachother, hug eachother, ride a ferris wheel with eachother, throw your friends into a meat grinder, throw your friends into an ocean, throw your friends into a train, get stuck in an elevator, die in an elevator, fall off a building, throw someone off a building, punch the ground, jump in fire, break a shelf, ride a conveyer belt, climb a wall, go on a boardwalk, mess with gravity, get sucked into a fan, grab onto a moving fan, float above a fan, get stuck on a glacier, break a glacier, get stuck on the piece of a glacier floating away from the bigger glacier on which your friends are on, die trying to swim back to your friends, and much, much , much, more."

It might be great one day.Long version...This game is frustrating because it could so easily be better if the devs put more work into it; and because with a few patches, it could become something great.While you can lift things, there doesn't seem the be a button to throw what you've picked up. Neither are there any loose objects that you can pick up to use as weapons, which seems like a missed oppurtunity. Punching seems to occasionally be able to knock people out (though is usually completely ineffective), but they only stay KO'd for a second or two.All of these thing I discovered through experimentation while trying the game with a few friends, as neither the controls nor the mechanics are explained in the slightest. In the end, we were only able to extract about 45 minutes of fun from it, at which point I promptly requested a refund. The game badly needs a tutorial and possibly a Smash Bros style HUD."

Now the characters wake so fast you have no chance of throwing them into/off of something to their doom. Also the headbutt move doesn't even work anymore! And it was fun to be able to climb up the walls like spider man. (also the character select screen looks pretty bad) I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm being harsh but my brother and I played this game for 7 strait HOURS. Don't get me wrong it's still a amazing game it just isn't as fun.

Divide the spices evenly between 2 mixing bowls. Add the flour to 1 of the bowls, mix well, and set aside.Rub the Human drumsticks with the reserved spice mix. Poke all of the pieces with a fork a few times to let the flavors seep down into the meat. Set aside.Pour the buttermilk over the Human, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Cook's Note: You can also let the Human marinate longer, even overnight.Add the flour mixture to a large re-sealable plastic bag. Remove the humanpieces from the buttermilk and in batches, drop them into the bag, shaking them to make sure they become heavily coated.In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 360 degrees F. (If you don't have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.)Drop the coated human drumsticks into the hot oil. Turn the pieces as they brown and do not let them touch each other while frying. Work in batches, if necessary check the underside of a piece by lifting it with tongs. It should be a deep golden brown. Cook the human until the pieces are crispy and brown, about 15 minutes, turning occasionally.To test for doneness: Cut into the thickest part of a drumstick. The juices should run clear and the meat should be opaque throughout. If necessary, pop the  human into a preheated 325 degree F oven, until they are fully cooked.Transfer the fried  human to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain the excess oil.Transfer the drumsticks onto a serving platter, or put into a bucket. Serve the human hot, room temperature, or cold."

After having an hour of fun we decided to pack up and leave, we said our byes and I was on my way to the bus stop, bus goes by, i've missed it, great.With 10-15 minutes to kill until the next one i decided to go and get a quick snack from the local shop, after coming out and going back to the bus stop, a bus goes by completely full, 15 minutes later, another goes by full. At this point im starting to realise i might be late to get to work. Another bus goes by. Full.I ring my brother in the hopes that he can pick me up, but he was going to gig very soon, i didn't want him to be late for that either, but still, my amazing brother races to me and picks me up and brings me home. Rushing food down my throat and having the fastest shower and getting ready as quick as I could I run up to work (i live like 20 minutes away), my work friend who I was on with that night looked rather confused as to why I seemed a bit tired.All in all, nearly missed work, nearly caused my brother to miss a gig, nearly choked on a half cooked steak and burnt a few calories running to work ALL because of this game.10/10 would do it all again."

,Recommended,285900,23678311,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,[LM]Deadshot,"Overall, this was a brash purchase on my end due to a lack of consideration on behalf of the element of multiplayer: local or online Beta.  This game is very fun, and has potential, but isn't the best consideration for someone expecting good fun by yourself.  The bots aren't that intuitive, and never target each other, leaving the player (me) hoping they decide to go ahead and throw me over when my character is ""knocked out"", as they normaly just derp dee derp around and senslessly drag me across the stage rather than send me to my well-deserved doom.  I'M RECOMMENDING THIS ON THE SOLE PURPOSE THAT IT CAN BE VERY FUN WITH FRIENDS AND OTHER PEOPLE, but the single player element and the AI needs some serious love.  It would be neat if such features as ""tag teaming"" with bots were an option, or even if they focused on each other every now and then.  A huge AI vs Player vs AI brawl would be beautiful, and may very well be added sooner or later.  As of right now, it's just PvE without another person.  Bottom line: I do NOT think this game is worth the 20 dollars I payed.  That isn't to say the game itself isn't a gem in its own right.  A much more appropriate price at its current state should be around $5 to maybe $12 at the most.  That aside, the game has potential but needs some lovin'.  Keep your expectations low, and your hopes for a better future for this game high. I look forward to my $20 paying off."

,Recommended,285900,14738830,"Posted: 4 March, 2015",all,SpacemanJupiter,"Absolutely love this game! Let me get some things out of the way here. This is very early work. There is no online MP, but I'm hoping they are able to add this in the future. There is local MP up to 8 players but I don't have any friends close by to play with. I have been spawning AI players using '9' and '0'. Unfortunately that is hit and miss, as they often spawn in precarious locations such as halfway into a wall, where they will get stuck. This needs addressed. Those 9 and 0 options don't always work either. My frame rate takes a hit when 8 players are running around. Not sure if that is the AI or the physics, maybe both.I just can't stop laughing when I play this game. Aside from the unfinished aspects, once I get some action going it is a trip. I love the physics based play because you don't really know what's going to happen, and animations are somewhat random as well, which makes it even better and more goofy. The physics gameplay is definitely what makes this special. There is a LOT of potential here if the dev continues work on this. The graphics are simplistic but beautiful. Great lighting and shadows, super funny character designs and animations, and it actually feels like you're brawling like a mofo when you are controlling these characters. I absolutely recommend this and hope that people make the purchase to support the dev so they are able to continue work on it. I felt like $20 was a bit too much at first, but after watching the Giant Bomb youtube video and seeing how much fun they were having, and playing it, I definitely feel it's worth it because of what is here already and what the great potential is for refinement.In my opinion the game should stay pretty simple, but there are things that need work. Some things that would make it complete for me would be online MP, smoother frame rate with several AI, better spawn locations for spawning NPC's, a few more arenas, some more physics based objects for destruction if at all possible without killing frame rates, and maybe a few different game modes. How fun would a couple of king of the hill style arenas be? I run a GTX780 and an old AMD 1100t cpu. People with a better, newer cpu may not have the frame rate issues I have with 4-8 NPC's.I can't speak for everyone, but personally this is by far one of the purely funnest (and funniest) games I've ever played. Goes to show that complexity doesn't always make a more enjoyable game. I'm actually inspired now to do something like this myself after aquiring some more knowledge about modeling, animation and programming."

But one buggy stage isn't enough to make this a game bad. The controls, even with a gamepad (which is the best way to play) feel like a mix of Surgeon Simulator and a generic fighting game. The art style, while a fighting game, isn't all about violence, it feels more like watching plasticine figures beat each other up, and ragdolling when dead. The stages are well made, meaning that someone being overly confident might end up killing themselves rather than killing their oponents. Then there are the costumes, which not only make each player more distinctive, but also can lead to one coming up with their own one liners to boot as well!While I do feel that it is a shame this game may never reach Xbox Live or PSN, let alone the Nintendo eShop, this game brings back the feeling that PC gaming could become a legitamate local multiplayer platform, with perhaps a glimse of what could happen if a PC went to the living room, serving as a centre for TV, film, music and video games."

Gameplay is overall fun, and can hold quite a few people in a single game. However, controllers are necessities if you want to play with more than 2 people. There can be a few bugs every once in a while, but thats to be expected from an early access game, and they aren't game breaking.8/10, great gameplay but you need controllers to enjoy it."

Skins and Player customization are a nice feature, but lack the charm some of the original characters had. What I'm getting around to saying is, this game has changed a great deal since the early stages. I'm not sure I agree with some of the changes that have been made Graphically, and Mechanically during development. The old climbing and Gripping had to be the most fun feature in the game, as you could climb up on top of buildings, and into places you never would be able to experience otherwise. Limited jumping may seem fine to a new player, but now that it has been removed, it feels a bit lackluster. I know it sounds like I'm blowing it out of proportion, but I really do feel that the original variants of the maps were much more interesting than the new ones, as simple as the old ones were.After all that I've said, can I recommend this game? Yes, well... Sort of.For 20$, the time that I've had with friends on the couch is one of the funniest, most enjoyable experiences in gaming that I've ever had the pleasure to recieve. The glitches are almost never game breaking, but add to the hilarity of the experience. There was a glitch on one of the old maps that allowed you to break off a piece of Gondola cable and fly around on it like a broomstick from Harry Potter. I really do hope that the devs take the time to understand what the community for this game is asking for, and push their game in the right direction.If you have a bunch of friends, and a steam link or have your computer next to a couch, get this game, the local multiplayer is a blast."

We get in the game, make our characters custom, and go on. First thing we notice is about a 1.5second delay on EVERY action. For games like this, it makes the game almost unplayable. We googled the issue, found out that EVERYONE complained about this, and the only response was ""Your internet sux lol"". My latency runs from 40ms-60ms MAX, its not latency, and theres no fix for it.Pro--Game is really fun (Nothing like picking up 3 people at once and throwing them off an elevator)Cons--Delay in commands.Online matching is flawed (took 20 minutes to get me and my 2 friends in the same game)"

,Recommended,285900,14315999,"Posted: 3 February, 2015",all,Armored Fetis,"Gang Beasts recently received a massive overhaul that fixes various issues. There used to be a fairly common glitch where one player's controller would simply stop working, which was rather annoying, but that glitch has been fixed. Climbing has been removed. While it was fun to climb around all over the maps, it could get quite annoying when someone would climb to an area that would cause matches to last WAY too long. Before, there was a button to collapse, with no way of determining which way you would collapse (useful for picking up unconscious players), but now there is a forward collapse button and backward collapse button. It appears that the game only supports up to 4 players now, however, I have not tested that. Headbutting has been added. Now, not only will you be flailing your arms and legs at people, you can now smash people violently with your face. There is a collision issue where, sometimes, when you step on an unconscious player, both players might get sent flying. There is also a character selection screen where you can pick your costume and color, rather than picking in a seperate menu and not knowing which player each person was going to be. New maps have been added, although it seems some maps, such as the ferris wheel map, have been removed."

Sadly it has been dormant for a while but thanks to ""Gang Beasts"", "" Nidhogg"", ""Broforce"" and others it is back with a vengeance.  This game may be the most fun I have ever had.  Sure, the concept is simple.  But combine the quirky art style, wonky physics, and hilarious sound effects you have yourself something to keep you and your buddies entertained for a long while. :)EDIT:  It is with great sorrow I have to join others in saying this is not worth a purchase at the moment.  I adore this game, however each update has gotten worse and worse.  In the latest one they literally removed the in game scoreboard, nerfed headbutts, nerfed kicking, and even nerfed climbing.  I have absolutely no clue what the devs are thinking.  I actually had the old version on my laptop still and I transferred it over to a non steam game on my desktop which my roomies and I play frequently.  Version 3.0 is the best version, everything after is garbage.  Actually everything shown on the store page has changed so it is essentialy false advertising currently.  Devs, what on earth are you guys doing?!??!"

Looks like a fun game and can't wait to try it myself just wish the control layout was accesible at anytime in an options menu and that maybe they where a little less complicated.

This game is like a 3D  punch out (LOL punch out) umm more like a 3D mortal combat...I Think I can get a little more specific. Umm i guess it a hybrid of those two games. First, the graffics look great even though i run it fast they still look good. Another thing i love is the customization you could look like a worker or a man dressed up with a burger on his head (XD). Another thing i love is the maps my favorite is probaly is..hmm...uhhhhhhh..all of the because they all seem so GREAT that they're all so unique one is shooting pultry paste at you (Poultry paste: weird meat slime) and another has you over a giant fan. I could go on forever about this game i highly recomend it and btw i barely do reviews and their always short. but if you love fighting games or just really any game it is worth the $20.00 price tag.P.S. if you want to play with someone just add me ;)"

Its visually appealing and preforms quite well on most systems.I have many hours on this game (about 20+) not tracked offline. Brought it to gatherings where all could watch/play and be entertained.I was able to introduce this to non-gamers and regardless whether they won or loss they loved watching slapstick funny fights. Controls are relatively simple figuring out how to pick up and throw a player can get technical. Online was recently added in an update so don't worry if you can't immediately find others to play with. A XB 360 wireless controller adapter & XB one adapter can be combined for local 8 player.

I don't think this game will be actively updated, nor does it seem like the dev team cares too much. And so it will most likely remain in it's current state for a while, and if this recent 'update' is any indicator, the updates seem to remove more than it adds.

With what you pay you don't expect a perfect game, but it shouldn't feal like a free game that has terrible internet connection. It's better to play Jesus Christ RPG Trilogy for free rather than this, at least it has good content. This game has clunky mechanics and it is mostly based on luck. The game dosn't make much sense as to how some random player has a better chance of holding on than the other and makes it seem unfair. This game is basically a button mash and hope for the best or try play strategically with your moves and get punched in the face until your character has no chance of getting back up. This game seems like it was made by a child, for children. I recommend you buy one of the classic games like Skyrim or Metro Redux (Personal favourite examples) Yes this game costs more than the origional Elder Scrolls Skyrim yet Skyrim has millions of more content and is still fun after so many years.Don't make the same mistake I did, it is fun for the first hour but then it just gets anoying. I would give this game a 2/10 for effort. I don't know the size of the dev team but if they think it's a good idea to have the game sell at a tenner rather than making it around 1.99/2 pounds like Who's Your Daddy did or other games.

However due to very little variaty this game does not offer extended hours of gameplay. It's just the kind of game you could play with some friends every once in a while to have fun and a good laugh.The servers are absolute garbage at the moment, most of the time you'll have to attempt around five times before you can finally join a server. Imagine trying to join the same server with a couple of friends, it will be terror.This game is worth less than five euro.

Good luck with that. Purchased 3 copies so my teenagers and I could play with one another on our individual computers. No can do. Turns out that the only way would be hooking up multiple game controllers to one computer and sharing the single screen. Not cool. So, we created a 3-person party and attempted to play an online game. Right. Very, very few servers available, most are full, and the others only have one, or at the most 2 slots open, and even as a single player I could not get logged on to any of them (we play many local and online multi-player games with no problems). Constantly being disconnected before anything even happened. Not impressed. Requested refunds for all three copies."

,Recommended,285900,32102204,Posted: 1 June,all,El Cereal Box,"Very fun game, honestly.This game is a fun party game, it includes a mode that little PC games, or video games in general, contain nowadays, local multiplayer. Recently they've also added online multiplayer, and it's definitely fun to mess around with friends, either betraying (they'll do this to you) or saving them (they'll just betray you right after). It's definitely one of the most hilarious games I've played, the ragdolls are funny, and when you fail a jump and fall to your death, or be thrown to your death, as I said earlier, being betrayed, you'll just laugh, you won't even be angry. Also, customizable characters, a small, but definitely nice touch, it makes everyone unique.There's no game without it's faults, though, is there?The bugs with multiplayer are so frequent, it's not even justifiable. Sometimes buggy physics cause lag, sometimes it just stops working mid-game. Most of the time you can't even cycle through all the maps without having to disconnect. Recently I have experienced less of these problems though, so maybe most of the problems were fixed, but it's still common to have a major bug here and there.The game is good, it really is. But with the $20 price tag, and all the bugs stated earlier, is it worth it? Yes, I believe it is. If they patched the bugs, and added maybe a bit more customization options, I would give this a 9/10, currently, it sits at a 8/10 though.Final verdict: 8/10, atleast until fixed."

76561198027058385,Not Recommended,285900,33588852,Posted: 16 July,all,EntropyNT,"Yes, I understand this is early release and beta, but this game has had massive glitches and errors for the 2 years it's been in early release. To name a few, physics glitches, game crashes, sound cutting in and out, constantly kicked from servers, game freezes requiring force quitting, and the list goes on. Again, beta, but it's been this way for 2 F*&KING years. Anytime I play this game I spend about 1/3 to 1/2 of my time trying to connect to servers, resarting the game, and force quitting.The worst part is I freaking love this game. I've never had so much fun with my friends with a couch multiplayer, I've never laughed so hard. This game is an amazing concept and when it works (haha) it's fantastic. I want to love and recommend this, but I can't due the insane amount of technical issues that currently plague this game. Also, due to the amount of time this has been in development for a relatively simple game, I have very low confidence this will ever be completed, or if it is, it's likely to still have tons of bugs. I really think if the developers just hired a bunch of experienced programmers they could finished this in a few months and it'd be one of the best indie couch/online multiplayer games ever made. Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen.Also, $20 for this game? Really? You can pick a few skins, there are like 10 small maps, there's no campaign or story or decent single player. If this game didn't have so many bugs I'd say $15 tops, but realistically this game should be $10 or less. If you're going to buy it, wait for a sale, but my recommendation is not to buy this until they work through most of the bugs, if ever."

When tehy finally got the game we played for a bit and loved it, but when we just wanted to be me and him in a local server we could not be in a local server alone it said "" not enough people in matchmaker lobby.""  Which discouraged me I thought we could go into a map and play alone against AI, but sadly that piece of content was removed.  Another problem that I had was some of the costumes, don't get me wrong I love the costumes now, but I would like to see the old ones come back as well.  All in all the game is still sort of good if you are just looking to some goofy moments whilst fighting against other people.  But if you and your friends want to fight against AI then this game would not be for you.  At least yet maybe they will update it to have AI again."

However, the version that I played at PAX seemed a bit different than this one. Also, I bought it under the assumption that it had supported online multiplayer. - My mistake for not reading the details. This was the only thing that was a bummer for me since there is only one friend who lives near me that likes to game and this game is the most fun with a large group. I recommend this game because I experienced it at its best - playing with a crowd of cheering people. Without other players, this isn't a game and it has no playability. This is the reason for why I'm giving the low rating. The game is fantastic but only works when there are other players. The focus for developing this game should then be to make sure that everyone (with tons of friends and without) can experience this game at it's best. Gang Beasts team, please add online multiplayer support or at least make some AIs that I can fight against.Cheers."

For starters theres no tutorial in alpha, so u have to know the buttons from the original gang beast. Theres no story mode in alpha and with that being said, theres also no AI for you to randomly fight bots, so literally its just you and motionless people if you dont play with local people. Thats just before you play btw, now game wise: if you're on a certain part of a edge, you cant get back up, you're done. Fighting stamina needs to be longer or knockout need to be shorter cuz if you punch a certain way the person will knockout your guy but your stamina will still say you're concious still however the person can just free punch you till u are out conscious and even then he can punch u all day just to troll and you cant move. I think there doesnt need to be a knockout stamina unless its a game mode, you should just keep fighting till the person kicks you off completely by fighting hard for it, cause it be more fun to fight and throw out a concious person then one knocked out concious. I liked the potential of this game but i have no idea why they would release it in alpha, however when they fix all the major stuff, i will suggest this game to all."

You also cannot climb very high anymore which used to be loads of fun. The biggest problem I have with the game now is probably the fact that characters are only knocked out for about half a second. It used to be nerve racking when, before the update, your character would be out cold for 3 or 4 seconds and you'd be mashing buttons to revive yourself while opponent would pick you up and attempt to throw you off the map.It's still a fun game, but I feel like I don't enjoy a single thing about what has changed since the update.

- prophet still, if bird or devil! -Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-On this home by Horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!""Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.""Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""""Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,"" I shrieked, upstarting-""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!""Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sittingOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floorShall be lifted- nevermore!"

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."

I'm running an i7-4790K with a GTX 970 4GB as well as 8GB's of RAM...Should be more than enough to run it, right?...Wrong. It does not run properly.

,Not Recommended,285900,30533623,Posted: 15 March,all,Communist Walrus,I will change my review if this game gets gud but to be honesy it sucks. #1: Once you get the game you cannot play multiplayer until you set the game to unstable. The unstable version is easy to hack because if you've ever played someone named IGGGAMES then you'll want to kys. #2 It seems that Gang Beasts is not a main priority for Double Fine. #3 $20 for this piece of crap with about 2 is not worth it.

Now to justify this statement let me tell you my experience. Let's start from the begining. I watched a couple of youtubers play this and i thought it looked cool, so I saved up my money and got the game, that was a bad decision. As soon as I booted up the game and staarted to play I realize that I didn't know how to play (Where the ♥♥♥♥ was the tutorial????). So I tried to look for the controls in the settings (at least that was there) and the whole thing was just... off. I felt the controls didn't make sense what so ever. so I tried to do singleplayer to learn the controls by my self (since the settings didn't ♥♥♥♥ing help). Well tring to learn by my self didn't work so I tried to change the controls and I would just like to say to the developers, 'Get your ♥♥♥♥ing act together.' Instead of pressing each button one by one of what you want make it a list that you can change individualy and still ♥♥♥♥in' see what you have set for other controls. After that I decided to be nice and givit a second (technichaly third) chance, and try to see if I could do online multiplayer ( just like the youtubers). HAH HAH... no no ♥♥♥♥ing online multiplayer (How the ♥♥♥♥ did the Youtubers get it then).Conclusion: this game is a waste of money and time. point in case DON't GET THIS GAME!!!!! (I warned you!!!)"

So i changed punch to Y + U and lift to I, but then i couldnt have two buttons pressed at a time some reason. For example i held someone with both hands then pressed lift and nothing happened, i also couldnt move while holding him, then i hold him with one hand and i lift and it works.

A game is not going to be finished when it's still in it's baby shoes.But is that SERIOUSLY the only excuse for not even having a single player mode? Is that really the reason why it is nigh impossible to play it on a European keyboard without reformatting it? Is that truly the reason why keyboard controls are wonky as hell? Why the heck am I not able to rebind the keys? That is one of the simplest things to program... EVER.I mean, this game is being sold, for Pete's sake! At least a TINY amount of leniency would be nice!Don't get me wrong, I'm sure this game is a lot of fun with a bunch of friends with controllers and whatnot. But how come Broforce, for instance was able to have not only several single player but also several multiplayer modes in its Early Alpha stages? It was perfectly playable with either controllers or a keyboard too!Graphically, the game is fine. Very nice, smooth colours that suit the simplistic aesthetic, cute character models, extremely sweet lighting. An absolute beaut to look at. Nice ideas for stages, good physics, decent music, not a bad concept either.But the controls are so broken and the modes are so troglodytic, that I can't like it just yet.I really want to recommend this game, I really do.But when it is this underdeveloped and this overpriced, I simply cannot.I shall write a new review once these flaws have been fixed."

But there is promise of more game play options in the future.

The maps so far are all pretty fun and allow for an unlimited amount of ridiculous situations.I definitely recommend this game if you have 4 controllers and 3 friends willing to play (I guarentee they will love it once they get the controls down, which are by no means difficult). It is unlimited FUN! You will find yourself laughing at some of the most ridiculous♥♥♥♥♥♥I say I recommend it but the game definitely needs some work. BUT, it does have SO MUCH potential. There could be a huge community for this game if you allow players to edit levels/costumes and stuff. I see this game being one of the most fun local multiplayer games on Steam, although there aren't many. Please continue to update this game! With the price tag for early access I guarentee the developers now have some space and freedom to make some tweaks and updates. Put time into developing this game and it will be LOVED. but, I already love it!A couple things I am hoping for in the future:1. Level editor/Steam Workshop/More levels2. Online multiplayer so that eight players is an actual option when playing (I don't know how to connect more than 4 xbox controllers to my wireles receiver)3. More than one game mode. The only mode is Survival, where you play with a set number of lives and don't respawn after you are killed in a round. A simple respawn game mode would be great. Team deathmatch? Capture the Flag? There are so many possible game types that could be added.4. More settings variability. There really isn't much you can change, yet.5. More customization. Pick your own color, more outfits, etc.6. Useable items. Bats, swords, thrown items, chairs, etc. Just random blunt objects would be hilarious.7. An option for more gore. Bloody faces/body parts, cuts, bruises. Overall more detail on players.8. Scoreboard (besides the number of lives left in a game) The scoreboard could include KOs, kills, matches won, self destructs, damage dealt etc. I would love to see a data list of all the things that players did in the game.9. Some kind of replay option?10. Option to replay the same level instead of going straight the the menu. Maybe just a better level picker after a match or something. Voting for maps?GANG BEASTS FOR THE WIN."

However, the changes from the free early versions to this one weren't entirely for the better. For one, remapping controls is gone, and the Tutorial, Sandbox, and Street levels are gone. If you look past it, though, the improvements and additions are exactly what I was hoping for. The new and remade maps are nice, and the improved graphics and lighting compliment them well. The costumes match the stupid nature, and the eight characters, while unnecessarily plentiful, are an improvement. In the end, I would buy this if you could spare the money and time.

,Recommended,285900,14582234,"Posted: 21 February, 2015",all,TacticalTruth,"Gang Beasts: Adorable BrutalityIf you’ve never heard of Gang Beasts, this is the best way I can describe it:“It’s like a drunken physics-based version of Super Smash Brothers.”Gang Beasts is a game that, without fail, makes everyone who plays it scream with both delight and burning rage. The premise: you and your friends are dumped into an arena. The goal: beat the ever-loving snot out of everyone who is not you; and mercilessly throw them to their death.Sounds horrific. But the game is so cute and silly that instead, it just ends up being hilarious.The standard body you play as already looks like a stuffed animal of some kind. But on top of that you can wear animal suits that elevate the game to a whole new level of adorable. However, there are plenty of other outfits to choose from–if you’re feeling dapper, a top hat and tie. Perhaps a sombrero is more your style?(The sombrero has saved my life many times. Just sayin’.)There isn’t a whole lot to Gang Beasts mechanically. If you’re using a gamepad, you tap on the left and right bumpers to punch. Hold them to grab onto whatever you’re touching: whether that is the floor, a wall, a ferris wheel cart, your friends unconscious face, or even your own sombrero.The punching and grabbing mechanics are used exquisitely. The main way to defeat your opponents is to beat them unconscious, grab them, and throw them out of the arena. You can also press Y (on an Xbox 360 controller) to raise your arms, allowing you to perform a myriad of tasks such as: joyously gloating over your conquered friends, lifting their limp bodies over the railing, or impromptu dance offs!Currently Gang Beasts is a local co-op game in which up to eight people can brutalize each other in 10 unique stages. Every stage in the game features some kind of theme, like a massive wind turbine which affects the gravity in the room, window washing gondolas you can push your friends off of (or even break the support wires, if you’re devious), or the back of shipping tucks on the highway.It should be said that Gang Beasts is an early access title, which means that the game is not a finished product. However,Gang Beasts is great despite it’s unfinished state. There is plenty of content in Gang Beasts, and the developers keep adding more. Despite being ‘unfinished’ it feels complete. My only complaint with the game is its price. Currently it is listed on steam for $20 dollars. By itself, I don’t think that Gang Beasts is worth $20…However, if you have three or more friends, the game becomes exponentially more attractive. I was able to get four friends to pitch in, lowering the total price to $4 a piece. Definitely a great deal.Unfortunately if you don’t have a group of friends who meet up regularly enough to justify the purchase, you’re kinda out of luck. The game has no AI bots (yet) and cannot be played in a meaningful way alone. You have to have at least one other person.This game is wonderful, dumb, and stupid in the best possible ways. Listening to your friends’ frantic screams as you beat them unconscious and throw them into a meat grinder is always hilarious.That’s probably the worst thing I have ever written…Despite its price, Gang Beasts has universally been a great time, no matter who I play it with. Screaming and yelling mixed with giggling and heartfelt laughter is a constant companion. I hope you can also experience the massive swings of joy and rage that are intrinsically a part of this game. It truly is worth it.Like this review? Check outhttp://100hoursave.wordpress.com/"

I love having friends over for some smash bros or zombies.I have observed us while playing Gang Beasts. This game produced the most laughs. It is just ridiculously glorious.Some suggestion for future improvements I would really like to see in the future:-Add NPCs to versus mode. With configurable levels of difficulty. It could become so much fun. Imagine being two players against 6 npcs with 10 lives each. Would be even more glorious.-Add an option for continuous spawning: Instead of waiting for a last man standing each round, spawn the player as soon as he dies, like in smash bros. More fluid gameplay. A switch between the two would be nice. I would still switch between the two now and then.-Add an option to the waves prototype to make it endless(like COD Zombies, try and survive as long as possible). Wave 10 is actually pretty easy to reach once you are experienced. I would've enjoyed trying up to wave 16 or even more lol.-Add more maps to the waves prototype.I see this game as the next smash bros. It's really good. The above are just suggestions.

But thankfully, it's only on certain maps, as I said before. The controls are (kind of) hard to get used to, but I found out pretty fast how they work. (Or at least some of them.) The ones I know so far are: Left Click=Punch/Grab Right Click=Punch/Grab Shift=Raise arms(Can be used to lift someone after grabbing their body) And... well that's all I've figured out as I've just purchased this today. However, what I would like to see is online matches that you could join. To play this, you should at least have a few friends come over and play. Or, if you don't have friends (like me :( ), you can play one player. And when you start a one-player match you might think: ""Why am I the only one here?"" or something like that. Well, if you want to spawn some AI, just press 9 and 0 together. You can also spawn in other objects by using other number keys. I've only encountered one minor glitch, is in the level: ""Vents"" I jumped over top of the giant fan and it was going the other direction so it sucked me in instead of blowing me upwards. Then, as I fell down the hole with the giant fan, my character wouldn't die so I had to close the game. It wasn't much of a problem to me, but it might be a bigger problem if you're in the middle of a game with friends. And again, I would love to see online matches. :D"

But as of now I cant give this title due justice. In my opinion, its not an enjoyable experience. This game makes you feel like your high, pounding the jump key to move. I guess I will start with a pro and con list.Pros-Sit around the couch with up to 7 of your friends-Funky menu music-They are planning to add a singleplayer, eventually!Cons-No tutorial-No basic button or key control instructions (Just a simple, how do you jump, how do you move, why is my player moving backwards)-The physics are so horrible in this build.-I kinda feel like there should be some map descriptions, but that may be my own preference. I would just like to know what Im playing, instead of relying so heavily on Youtube.-Feels so wonky and out of place. Feels like they have a LOT to finish. (If it does, Great! If it doesnt too bad)I feel the main problem is that unless you are really, really good at this game. And play the game like you are a drunk reindeer you will fail miserably every time. You cant even really punch, you just have to move around aimlessly and hug(or hump) the other blob and jump attack him to throw him off. This is a big reason why knowing the right controls would help. Not a lot, but some. This game makes you hate blobs of fat and maybe thats a good thing. But now you really hate them as your body is seen streaking across the screen.Gang Beasts, I love you. But you deserve no more than a 2/10 in my book"

It was hilarious, we played both against eachother and in the waves gamemode, and eagerly awaited online multiplayer to make it into the main build so we could take the matches online.Since then a new patch was released (0.5.0?). Annoying extra screens and more loading times were added. The waves mode at least is no longer playable due to be constantly knocked out by the AI and spending most of your time doing literally nothing, and when you do manage to knock one of them out lifting them in the air no longer works properly, resulting in them flailing around wildly. The fighting mechanics have gone from laugh-out-loud, over-the-top fun to frustrating, with some of the best and funniest moves seemingly removed from the game and the camera angle changed for the worse for no apparent reason. I'll admit I have not yet tried online or local multiplayer, but have no desire to at this point.Fix it or revert it and I'll recommend it, until then I just can't, no matter how much I DID love playing the game...0.5.2: Being constantly knocked unconcious in the Waves gamemode seems to be fixed, camera angles still worse than before and the fighing mechanics still haven't been reverted, game still feels more clunky, definitely less fun than when I started.0.5.3: Could not get online to work in any way shape or form, beginning to give up.0.5.4: As with 0.5.3 could not get the online to work at all."

But if you have some controllers you can hook up, a few friends looking to have a blast, and some spare dollars, I will not hesitate to recommend this to you.Also wanted to mention that yes, it's an Early Access title so take that as you will. Updates come out usually monthly. They're currently in the process of upgrading the entire game to Unity 5 (from the previous version). What this means is that there's a stable version of it running with Unity, and an unstable beta version that you can opt into that's running Unity 5. The Unity 5 version has improved graphics, lighting, physics, etc. but still a little buggy. It has less stages and costumes, but additional game modes.Again, it's a blast if you're looking for a multiplayer game with some friends. Personally one of my favorite games for couch gaming."

You can do it with a keyboard, and typical WASDESpaceSHFTCTRL (if that makes sense), but only for one person. Since it is a local party game, this is no fun, and even if it was, for some reason the AI currently is not in the game. But it is an amazing game; give the devs some time, and you can stick a bunch of keyboards into your laptop for a road trip. And if you already have wired controllers, PS4 wireless controllers, and/or Micro-hard-to-use's wireless controller reciever (or a homemade one), you can play it pretty well. And even if you don't, soon you can use whatever control scheme you want."

Things are definitely not complete, but the game is still pretty good for being so early in development. I have played a fair amount of this game with my friend who comes over frequently. That is the only time I have played it though, because so far there is only local co-op. Even though I haven't played a whole lot of this game, just about every moment was filled with laughter and fun. The goal is to knock your opponent down by punching/kicking them over and over again. Sounds like fun already, right? It is. Then you throw them into a deathtrap of sorts. On Grind, there are rotating grinders in the ground and on the walls, on Subway, there is a train that comes around and turns you into finely ground man-paste, and some places you just chuck them into the endless abyss where they fall endlessly.There are outfits and hats to dress your character in, all varying in color based on what color you are. Adds a fun element of me crouching on to the ground in my dino costume and dragging my face across the dirt singing ""Walk the Dinosaur"". Quite entertaining until I got my head stomped on. The predicaments you get into like hanging from the Ferris Wheel cars on Wheel with your friend hanging on or floating in the air in the map Vent, only to be dropped into the cavity under the fan because it stopped blowing, are very entertaining. If you like fighting games, and you have friends (Up to eight players at once) I'd give Gang Beasts a try, especially considering that the game is still very early in development and it can only get better."

For the first few minutes I was randomly stabbing at buttoms to see what they did before discovering that TAB opened the control/info screen. Little things like having a tutorial and having more easily accessible controls/options would make the game much more accessible.Apart from those little gripes though, Gang Beasts is solid fun - the mechanics are great and with good friends (and a few beers!) it quickly descends into addictive and engrossing fun."

Or you can plug them in one ata time when the game is running. The only issue I've seen is that my brother usesone of the miniature xbox 360 usb controllers, and sometimes that one will screw up the playerorder, sometimes controlling two players with one controller.We've been able to play with a mix of controllers when my friends get together:2 PS4 controllers, 1 XBONE controller, 2 usb 360 controllers and a third party usb controller.EDIT:After playing this for a while, we made up a new mode on our own. If you hold both shoulder buttons, you can grab onto players or objects. However, you can even grab the walls! When grabbing the wall, hold Y, then alternate between letting go and grabbing again with each shoulder button. Your character will slowly climb up the wall. This works on all of the levels including other objects such as the ferris wheel cars, the sides of the trucks and the sides of the hanging containers. Simply hang on and watch your friends flounder as they die trying to get to you!Also, if you want a target on your back, pick the ""puddin"" costume in the options menu."

,Not Recommended,285900,13760222,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,iBenParry,"This is an early access review. As the game changes, updates, so will my opinions and views of this game.I have followed Gang Beasts for a while now. I've played all their public releases, watching the devs update their game and now, I've purchased the game on Steam. Now as the game currently stands (1/1/15), I cannot recommend it, which hurts to say because Gang Bests is a fantastic game to play, but from their public releases to their Steam Early Access, it feels like they've gone a bit backwards.Firstly, I'm extremely happy they added in AI into the game. Yes, it's quite simplistic and needs work, but for now it will do. But one of the main problems I have with this game isn't to do with the AI, it's to do with the controls. As an example, in their public releases, you were able to remap the controls, but that's been removed. Not sure if this affects anyone else, but my Xbox 360 controller is not supported. It's a legit controller, bought it from the right people, but it's not working, which is again, another step back since it worked in the public releases. They've removed a few levels from the game and I don't understand why. They had a tutorial level, a little play area to mess around with the physics, etc, but it's been taken out. Finally, the fighting just feels clunky compared to the public releases. It feels slow and the punches don't flow together.Should you buy Gang Beasts? Yes you should, but you shouldn't buy it now. The game still needs a lot of work and keep in mind it's only local multiplayer, and they won't be adding online support for a long time. Either wait for the game to go on sale, or wait for it to improve."

I've never yelled so loudly (in anger OR joy) at a game so much.Gang Beasts is still in early Alpha, and despite this, comes with a TON of physics-based levels, with some (like ""Trucks"") standing way above the rest. I'd say watch a few videos online to see if it's your cup of tea, but honestly, you don't really ""experience"" Gang Beasts until you invite a few friends over and get a match going.

You have a choice of a dozen character models, and they just implemented character customization, allowing you to make some memorable fighting champions. They have some pretty memorable levels, with some being very tangible and destructive environments, this with the wacky character physics makes some pretty outright funny moments.Cons:-Climbing, the player should be able to climb the surfaces they so chose. You having a grip timer, and making it harder to grab hold of the environment makes adrenaline filled moments of you trying to escape from a friend or climbing back up after being tossed over a hassle and destroys the momentum of the game.-Knockouts, the knockouts have been significantly nerfed. Instead of taking a dirt nap after getting sucker punched by an opponent. Now you wake up in a matter of seconds, making it incredibly difficult to toss an opponent over the edge. (And there's no sound dictating whether or not you get knocked out due to the recent update.)-The silly rag doll sucker punches have been removed. I've found when those moments happen, it was the best part of the game do to how spontaneous it was and downright hilarious. This game is not to be taken seriously, so please stop making it out to be a serious beat-em-up.Pros:-Hilarious and memorable fun especially gathered with a group of friends.-The fighting is spot on sometimes, I sometimes amaze myself on how I pull off moves (And I've played this game since day 1)-The colorful, cheery, and upbeat atmosphere.However, I will not be recommending this game due to the cons I have pointed out.

There is a separate button for left and right punch, holding either of these will grab and hold on. Which BTW can be to objects, rails, ledges, walls, clothing or accessories on players (ties etc.), even tails if anybody has one. There is a jump, dive, kick, and lift button. Lifting will raise or attempt to elevate whatever is being held. You Lift players to throw over a cliff or drop them into a grinder. Dangle your buddy off the edge with one hand and repeatedly punch his face with the other. Even then they still may pull you over the rail so hang on! YOu can even use the lift mechanic to climb. Jumping and kicking simultaneously results in a dropkick. Jump and dive is a head-butt. Really cool stuff and supposedly more to come.There is no online play. Hmm. I know it sucks. Like really bad. Like if there was this one tiny thing it would be a gold mine. But, if you are in the position to gather with a bunch of friends and throw it on a big screen, the result is catastrophically hilarious. Right when you drop your best friend in a grinder. Right when you sigh a breathe of relief, that's when your friend grabs your foot at the last second and pulls you in screaming and cursing.Not saying it comes without problems, the game modes other than the standard gang fights are very incomplete, and mostly novelty until further notice. In any case, this game deserves some attention. I love playing it every time I do. Very little makes me laugh this hard. But I don't play it alone, nor would I recommend anyone do either."

One thing is when I change it to one player and start a level it will either go back to main menu or say player one wins then go to the main menu and even when it does work and I have more than one life and I die it still says player one wins then goes to main menu. Some things you should add are in options or costumes menu we should be able to set the AI costume and color but still have a random costume and color option, also add like a team gamemode so there will be two teams and they have a team color and whoever is on your team you can't cause damage to them. Also some Ideas I have for updates are you can add a story gamemode were you go through all the levels and there's AI and there is a story that goes with it. Then another Idea for some AI you can add would be a normal guy but he helped you fight hostile AI or a animal type that grabs you with their mouth or hits you with their tail. You allready have lots of joystic support but I dont know if you could but i always have to vibrate my remotes with a DS3 tool, maybe you can add a remote vibrate button in the options or something.

I had a specific way of setting my controls, but in this version, (the full version) I cannot change my controlls, This leaves me with uncomfortable controls. If you could change your controls in the demo, why can't you change your controls in this game? I Just bought it today and I'm VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!! Also, I'd like to point out that you can't change the game mode for some reason. PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Having loved and cherished the demo with my sister, I eventually purchased the full game, and it doesn't work. I have never heard of a game getting 'undeveloped' as time goes on, but the team on Gang Beasts seem to have nailed it. Whilst you used to be able to play two player, with a controller and a keyboard, you now can't.The options menu is a pile of slush to be kept in a far away closet and never seen since it simply offers 'health bar?', 'grab bar' and 'resolution'. That said, it could improve. It is in alpha, and I really do hope it does, but in the current form, do not buy this game."

Not only is the sheer havoc and chaos of beating our friends and family to death, only to throw them into/off some of the following: cliffs, fans, edges, cars, trains, spikes, grinders, icy water, and more, but i also love the creativty that the game gives you, i often climb the gondolas with my brother, searching the in and outs of that map, along with many other maps. The climbing, if you know how to do it, is much like grow home, but it not as simple, because the devs did not specifically put it into the game. And for all those people who say it is only fun with a fried, they are not entirely right, because there is a way, by pressing the zero key and nine key to insert in boss people and reqular npc's to fight (but it is better with freinds of course). I recommend this game and i invite you to do whatever creative or fun thing that you have thought of."

Some situations are super funny and can be a real laugh with friends.The only problem: you need friends with you to play this game. The only option is to play local multiplayer, and for that you need at least one gamepad-like controller for someone else to play.Once this is developed into a full game with comprehensive AI and story mode, it will be the best game ever."

Over the years we've managed to play a variety of different games together. But none has made us laugh quite as much as this one.This game is now our new favourite to play together. The controles are bizarre and hillarious, resulting in the random flailing of limbs and unsettling sexual gestures. The physics are fantastic, the game is smooth and easy to watch. We love the character customization, our favourite being the chicken outfit. Nothing is more deeply satisfying and altogether hysterical than slapping and headbutting someone to unconsciousness dressed as a chicken. We were also pleasantly surprised that there are so many different stages to choose from. From small stationary platforms to large interactive spaces, each more chaotic than the last. In short, WE LOVE THIS GAME. In fact we're meeting up on the weekend to play it again!Also, you can actually play this game by yourself! Fighting waves of bad guys you have to see how long you can last. It does help if you have friends, but you can tackle this alone.10/10 - I love my friends, but I love slapping the sh*t out of them more."

The other half of the time you play, its spent being frustraited on why certain controls and settings are not working when you set them. Gang beasts requires to much for all the settings like bloom and the likes. Don't get the game if you have a low powered computer. Till they fix the 10000000 bugs in the game, it'll be worth the price they're asking."

A few of my favorite maps are ring, trucks, vents, and wheel.  I have a few suggestions for maps if the devs happen to read this review( by the way boneloaf #1). 1""sky"". in this map you and your friends fight in a plane that is falling though the sky, the windows are open and if you get too close it will suck you out into the sky. 2 ""park"" this map is basically a big trampoline that happens to be SUPER springy. Those are my map ideas, I hope the devs see the review. Again, AMAZING GAME!!! 11/10"

Some of the levels that are playable are just plain annoying.  Take the level with the boxing ring.  The aim is to throw the others over the top rope.  Great idea but it is just awkward, unresponsive to control.  Charactors just seem to stick to each other.  Very little skill and lots of spam the button.  Sometimes levels can last forever.  There is no countdown clock to end the level and in the end we just ended up killing ourselves so we could move on to the next stage.  The idea of the game is great but the game itself lacks gameplay and what should be a lot of laughs turns to frustration and annoyance."

As a party game, I think it's great but the novelty does wear out. It's a goofy brawler with weird physics that will put you on the edge of your seat, screaming and punching your friend in your face (both in game and IRL). There is a lack of diversity in gameplay though. Pretty much only one gamemode with a limited maps. The real fun is when you have a full party, 8 people. If you play this alone AND find fun in it, then...hey, god bless you man. So in summary, great party game, but don't expect to play it for months at a time.Recommended: Party GameRating: would pay $10.99"

Gang Beasts is a physics-based nonsensical party game that doesn't take itself seriously. You can pick this up and play with a bunch of friends without ramming any complicated control schemes down their throat. The game does have some minor bugs with its menu screens, but it's nothing a patch or two can't fix. After being with the game since the 0.0.2 alpha, I've seen huge improvements and I'm always looking forward to the next update.Cons:I would not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have any local friends to play with. As of this review (ver. 0.3.0) there is only one short ""waves"" gamemode for people who want to play solo and no online multiplayer. New features may add more to this, but for now you'll have to go out and be social to achieve the full hilarity this game offers."

Luckily, most of the things I have talked about in the past, have either been fixed or removed. I am now using a controller so keep that in mind as you read this.This game has become so much better over what seemed forever. I have still only played it singleplayer, but it is really funny to see all the enemys chase after you. I have been having lots of fun, and it seems the devs actually listened to my review, although many people have probably taken the extra step to go to the forums or something, so probably not just my review. The game is doing great so far, but I have a few recommendations.Firstly, I just want to say, you should definitly go ahead with the online multiplayer, I think it would be a great addition.Secondly, add steam workshop support, whether it be maps, costumes, whatever. I really want this to happen because of the funny parkour mps that could be made. You can actually climb pretty well in the game, although you can't get very high. But you can swing around if you are holding on to a bar of some sort.And finally, add more maps to survival mode.

The design and the art are so simple but are made creative through your actions and characters outfit. The maps are especially fun to play on because you can manipulate the environment to your advantage by breaking suspensions while you hold on as your friends fall to their demise,  or it can **** you over by hitting you with a moving sign, off the edge.However, although the gameplay and mechanics of Gang Beasts are fun, there are requirements needed to give you the best experience of the game. Some levels get really choppy without a fast computer even when you set the fastest settings on the game. Also, you really need three or four friends or family members to have a wholesome experience even if you're online or not, which brings up the Beta. Gang Beasts is an Early Access game which means it's not finished. It doesn't have all its maps, costumes, or speed yet and often the online game will kick you out because you didn't load fast enough or an error occurred.But, although those can be problems if you have a fast computer/laptop, and friends online, then you will often have a fun experience with this game with everybody. But this is just my opinion, you should still be open to others thoughts. After all, that's what these reviews are about.:D"

Every time I launch this game menus are changed, character creation is changed, graphics are changed. All this worked perfectly last year when I bought the game and in general this is cosmetic.I see that physics were fixed a bit, so now the game seems fun again, but yet that was working perfectly one year ago for christs sake.All this game needed at some point was some finished end-to-end experience. Some coop mode with campaign would be great. Playing with others againt AI has great potential, but at the moment all we have is this waves mode, which has two maps and no purpose at all.Guys look at Overcooked for example - its another game based on great idea, but its great, polished, end-to-end experience. It has a great campaign mode and generally everything is in place.Gang Beasts is good looking game based on great idea, but the development team needs to focus on finishing the game instead of tweaking minor stuff all the time, changing things that are already good and introducing new bugs. This game mechanics has a huge potential, but the gaming experience is so raw at the moment, there could be so many creative things done in the terms of game modes, campaign, maps etc, and still all there is is punching each other on same dozen of maps, only half of which are actually good.I wont say anything specific about online mode, as I am only interested in playing this locally. For me the game works best when playing drunk with friends, not with random people online (but I can imagine this is fun too). But my point is that there are already countless of great online games, but great local multiplayer games are still hard to find."

Hell yeahThat said, there's tons of bugs in this game.It feels unoptimized which is especially strange since it isn't graphically demanding.Sound will cut out every now and then, multiplayer is a pain, you'll clip through walls and floors occasionally and the controls are atrociously laggy. There isn't even a tutorial or practice mode for you to get used to them and the UI looks like a flash game from NewGrounds. Stages the devs put in the trailer for the game are nowhere to be seen, such as the sausage factory.However, this game is a goddamn riot to play. The first 2 hours I played it I couldn't stop laughing and its even better with friends when you're all trying to throw each other off platforms and knocking each other out.With friends this game is great and its better if you're not expecting anything competitive; just go in looking for a good time. The bugs in this game are very distracting though and its a bit surprising that this very unpolished game has been in development since 2014.Get it on sale, its not worth the $20 in the state its in and with rumors of a release date coming at the end of the year, I'm not sure how much the lazy devs will get done in a few months."

There are a few bugs but it doesn't effect (or affect?) the game much.One mode sees you and up to 3 friends battling it out on a variety of maps. From knocking your friends off of moving trucks, to shoving them into a furnace or even grinder. What's great is the controlls which allow you to controll your arms separately. So I can hold LB (on an Xbox controller) to grab my opponent with the characters left hand, and then repeatedly press RB to start smashing him with the right. If I grab with both hands by holding both RB & LB I can drag opponents around of even press Y and lift them up. X and B allow for head butts and kicks which when mixxed with the jump can make for some hilarious moves. If you can get in a good hit, you can knock your opponent unconcious for a second, which gives you time to throw him off an edge/into a crushing device. Continue getting more good hits and he will be unconcious for longer - but usually matches are ended by lucky hits or good timing pushing someone into a fan/onto the subway track.Another mode sees you and up to 3 friends CO OP together to take on waves on bot enemies on top a building.Looking forward to future updates like online multiplayer and more maps!PROS:- Great fun with friends (playing locally)- The controlls make for a new way to play fighting games- Good mix of some fun and hilarious mapsCONS- No online multiplayer- Some minor bugs"

HOWEVER being an early access game ill cut it sone slack but it does have somethings it could improve:1)online multiplayer (note at the time of this review they are currently working on it)2)more maps(already has a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of maps but they haven't added any new ones in a long time now)3)more character models(in one of the updates they removed a lot of character models that really made the game bring out some funny dialouge in people so i hope they bring them back D: like the sombrero and the headless, so far this is my most wanted feature)But besides that the game is still one of my alltime favourites (plz bring back the skins.   ( ;-;)."

It took me a bit to get used to, but when I did, I can confidently say I do prefer it. A bit disappointed in the lack of the tutorial (you could've shown me how to climb in this), sandbox, and a co-op test level (what's the harm in keeping at least the sandbox?). But the fixes made to Subway and Wheel almost make up for it. The new level is also a nice bonus. Definitely a work in progress, but a humble step into Early Access. I was more than happy to hand over $15 if it means Boneloaf can put out an amazing brawler that already shows some excellent potential."

I love the unique fight style this game has and it will make you laugh instantly.  I cannot wait until this game is finished, and I hope they make an entire series dedicated to this because I would buy every single game that would come out. Specifically, I am excited for the customization of the characters. The characters you can pick are already so fun and weird and it makes this game more unique than a lot of the other online ""fight style"" games. Additions I would suggest could be hilarious voice-overs that you can pick from and customize as well, so when you hit or get hit you could customize what sounds you'd want for each character. Another addition could be more hilarious weapons that maybe fall from the sky in little ""care packages"", similar to Smash Brothers, when you get combos on other players.The end result of the finished product will be worth every penny and possibly more. A game like this, if coming out on Xbox One, would easily be $50 and people would still buy it. Read through the light blue ""early access game"" description section of this game, and it explains why they are charging full price for this game even in early access. I think it's pretty great that the game developers want the user's feedback  to enhance or add to their content because it can only mean the best game possible."

It's that simple you can drop in and out.Interface and player options: The interface is arcadish and you have the basic options games include such as volume, graphics, etc. You can also customize your character to your liking with hats, clothing, etc.Bugs: There is some bugs such as rubber banding when your character is hit buy a train.

What I did not realize was how much of a roaring success this game was at exactly that. Gangbeasts is as much a fighting game as saturday morning cartoons is a serious drama, I literally describe this game as ""a drunken fight between multicolored idiots"". Gangbeasts is the game you put on to make everybody in the room die of laughter from how stupid everything going on is. There are plenty of costumes to choose between, the controls are simple enough that after 2 games most people can pick up how to play, the silliness of the matches and the physics make it so that nobody can ever leave a match legitimately upset, and the replay value is HUGE (matches usually last a grand total of 3-4 minutes).My only legit complaints so far is the limit of game modes, the menu options are a little bizarre to understand, and if you're not using a legitimate console controller you have to remap the buttons everytime you turn back on the game.

If only you could have more than 2 players without controllers, if only there was some form of single player, if only there was just MORE in general. Now I understand this game is in early development and there is lots to be done with it, I know for a fact that this game could have a 10/10 in the future if some kinks are worked out. But as it is right now, my score is 5/10."

Currently it is my favourite game on steam. This game has so much to offer, it is great becuase it has ridiculous fighting mechanics cool and funny chracters and costumes, and so many funny and dangerous levels to choose from. In GangBeasts anything can happen! I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun time with freinds!"

All ages and genders love beating the crap out of each other with the intuitive physics based fighting systems. Never known anyone to not like this. Great for parties. Mixes well with alcohol.Only con is that you need CONTROLLERS. Keyboard won't work but for maybe two people if you both bind your controls to totally different keys (IE, you can't use wasd on more then one keyboard and you can screw with the other plays with keyboards using their key binds)"

This game is well worth the money spent and even though my PC is relatively underpowered (When compared to other nerds on here) it still runs considerably well.Controls are a little tricky to figure out, as there is no option to view the single player controls (As far as I'm aware) but it doesn't take too long to figure out the majority of the controls.If I could add things to the game, it would definitely be to make the controls more easily viewed.Something huge this game reall needs to push it's rating even higher and I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants this, but give the other characters AI. I know the point of this game is to be local co-op but unless you constantly have someone to play with, the replay value isn't very high as those of us who can't get a house full of people to play together find themselves constantly throwing a ragdoll-statue out of the ring. This makes the game's novelty wear off very quickly.+Funny+Great Physics+Runs relatively well on less-powerful PC's+Nice graphics+Local Co-op makes good for parties.-Virtually no singleplayer-No online multiplayer-Controls aren't obviously mappedA lighthearted fighting game that is well worth the money if you have someone willing to play with you constantly, however, if you don't have anyone to play with, I'd stay away until they add AI as you will quickly get bored of fighting no one.If you have someone to play local co-op with, I'd reccomend this game.If you are looking for a game to play by yourself, I'd skip this one, at least until the opponents do something other than just stare blankly into the distance as you wonder ""Is this all there is?"""

This game revolves around the hazerdous, hilariously and brilliant maps that the players sloppily fight in.

We can play it for hours, making jokes about the characters, the gameplay or the environment. It is a multiplayer game that is very social, since the gameplay is very simple and does not steal your focus from your friends. Sometimes I feel more like I am hanging out with people than playing a game playing this because you have to make the fun yourself.The game is not so big, and got no story, so it may be easy to get tired of it after a while, but it depends a lot on the people playing.

Stick it on your wish list, and if one day the developers decide to fix SERIOUS bugs after they screwed up on a couple massive updates, go ahead and get it.

The maps are really cool and I'm waiting for more maps in the Survival.So far you have two different modes. Survival, composed of waves of npcs and the other one when you combat against somone else. You can play in Survival with another person and together win against the ever growing waves.I can't wait when it's completely developed and we can play without disconnecting all the time, when you can get achieves, you can get/buy more costumes, etc, etc.There aren't a lot of servers so far and it's almost impossible to play with other people in different computers via internet so that's a con but the game is still getting developed so I say you should buy it now, when it's still cheap considering the price it might get."
