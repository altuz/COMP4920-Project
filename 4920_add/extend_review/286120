Combat plays automatically while you do the strats (position your party, equip items, use items and skills), and thats the extent of your control aside for a few more minor things. At first that doesn't sound so bad, you might need to do certain things a certain way due to abilities your enemies might have. But this game has dumbed down everything that could potentially be challenging outside of direct combat:- Each character has a single skill. one. ONE!!!!!!! (I found that each actually has a team buff/debuff, but all of them weren't thought out very well, 2 classes even had the exact same one as well, which is a little bit silly).- Your characters are selected for you. WHY? Whats worse you need to pay in-game currency for the ability to select your characters? I don't understand what purpose it serves. You could say that it is to ease the player into the game, but that is BS since the game throws a full party of 3 people and those people are randomly selected out of the ones you can use, that doesn't sound like easing in.- Items stats are boring as f**k. Its a very simple add to damage, and any class can equip any weapon and shield and have it deal more damage than a weapon they would typically hold (I had a mage holding a sword that added 5 to damage. better than his staff).- A inventory system that I wish never exsisted. When your party picks up an item (which isn't notified very well to the player) it is added to the rather small inventory space, items are queued from the top and once you fill your inventory and find another item, the oldest item in your inventory is removed. What if I wanted to keep a potion? How can I stratergise if you don't give me the means to do so? You can't even remove an item from your inventory to bump a potion back to the top in order to keep. Why can't I do that? Seriously? It just seems a little bit stupid that I have to get rid of a useful potion for a god-awful weapon.Due to the lack of control the player has and the lack of information about how some of the game's simple game mechanics work during the tutorial, all combined with the simplicity of class and equipment stats and abilities... *sigh*I can't really say much about this game in its favour other than the visuals are pretty solid and the music isn't too bad, but the game keeps looping the same tracks over and over, so theres that.This game is bad, really bad. It's a bore to play and recommend none of you pick this up."

Not that there's too much wrong with that, I just thought I'd throw it out thereOverall, this game is worth your time if the idea of it interests you. It's fast paced, semi-randomized, and quite a bit of fun. I would recommend that you look up some gameplay on it to see if you are really interested in this sort of game. Right now it's on sale until April 25th, so I highly recommend buying it sooner rather than later.First Impressions Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18M0QqIRI5w"

So you can manipulate combat and EXP gains by pulling the ol' switcheroo._ Activate character specials: Very often you'll want to click that ASAP, so not much of a choice._ Use potions/equip new loot: Again, little actual freedom here. Pick the bigger number and heal when health is low._ Pick your Level Up bonus once in a while.Compare/contrast with what the RNG determines:_ The loot you get: Get nothing but 10 +1 swords in a row, fail dungeon. Retry with the same party and stats (and basically the same strategy, since there's little leeway for that), get proper weapons, shields and potions and breeze through the level._ The random events you get: You could get a real good weapon drop from the gnome! Or have to choose between losing 1/3 of your party or all your inventory. Five times in a row._ The stat increases you can pick, out of 3, at level-up time. Need more health, or a stronger special? Why not have more charisma instead, or maybe some magic attack for that knight guy!So what you do, what you actually have influence on, matters way too little compared to sheer luck (not the stat, you, the player's luck -- well, maybe if you're into that Quantified Self thing you think of it as a stat) (which is pretty grating, FYI, you NERD).UI's a bit clumsy too (for instance: only the highest charisma in the party matters, so you have to memorize who that is or pause when you have the option of a charisma increase), and it feels somewhat grind-heavy / free-to-play-ish (you can get pets/merchants to mitigate the RNG, but 1. it's not nearly enough and 2. they cost a looot, and heeey is that a second type of currency?).Anyway, skip."

Thing I'd take issue is, theres nothing Ive seen so far for this game to have the tag of ""RPG"".Theres no story to speak of (that Ive found yet anyway, granted I've only done 3 missions). Basically, theres a map with different missions you can choose. Choosing a mission gives you a brief description of it. Such as ""Protect the princess"" or what have you. Then it goes right to the battle.It looks like your typical JRPG, with your PCs on one side, enemies on the other. Each PC can only attack the enemy in front of it, except for certain items or abilities allow you to attack others. Each PC has a special ability that it can use based on the type of class it is. Attacks are in real time and keep going whether you want them to or not, as soon as a time bar is filled, the attack is made). Items are randomly dropped into a 4 slot thing at the left, when a new one drops you lose the one in the 4th slot. They are anything from weapons and armor, to scrolls that raise your level (NOT as big of a deal as in a real RPG) and potions with various effects.So enemies come in waves, with up to 3 on screen at different time. The final wave is a boss and there is a couple points in each mission where either you get to choose something good (healing, a good random item) or bad (cant gain exp, slowed down ect)Its an ok tablet-style casual game, but besides the fact that the classes are traditional D&D classes and you gain EXP which makes your characters better, theres *nothing* about this game that could be considered an RPG.I'd call it casual, maybe strategy. Based on the fact that the fun lies in switching your characters places to take hits and knowing when to use your special skill and who to put items on. But definitely not an RPG at all.RPG =/= fantasy setting."

The mechanics are fun, but it’s a tiresome game if you have little to no patience. You have three heroes chosen at random and can switch their places. They take whacks at enemies and you chose when you activate their special powers. It sounds fun on paper, but this game is difficult. It takes a bit to get around the difficulty and strategy of this game. If you have patience and enjoy strategy games, then go for it, but if you lack patience then skip it. No dialogue, no storyline, just tosses you in to figure it out. Cute artwork, but as far as I can tell, no options to turn down the sound? Bummer. Have fun! 5/10"

It may be an awesome game, but be aware there is a large commitment for entry. I personally did not feel as though the random elements were implemented correctly.Unlike skill-based combat roguelikes, such as Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy, this game is more of a strategy-focused combat roguelike. In skill-based combat, an entire run of bad luck feels as though it is partially the player's fault, for not being good enough. However, in strategy-focused combat, an entire run of bad luck feels out of the player's control. Even if a player does everything right, the bad luck can force a failure. (For the record, I do not count quick movement of the mouse to manage party members to be skill, as the core of this game is to use the correct strategies to approach situations.)As such, I feel as though this game could use a little normalizing of the RNG. Also, it feels very unforgiving of mistakes, which considering it is a roguelike, are not always apparent until after they are made. But I digress, I am bad at the game, so all of these complaints could be unfair or unjust."

It's not so much a matter of getting better at the game, as it is getting lucky with random events.For example, each time one of your characters levels up, it randomly selects three (out of about ten) skills you can choose from to increase. For each character there are about 2 skills that are vitally important and another 3 that are useful. So you HAVE to get lucky in the skill selections to succeed. You also need to get lucky in item drops.Even once you know what you are doing, you have at best about a 5% chance of beating a level. If this were closer to 25% it would be tolerable, but as it is it's just terrible.A Small Revision:After I found out that you can farm the blue crystals by replaying the first dungeon over and over, the game does become fun. Still there's definately a failure of design if it only becomes fun after you unlock everything.Except for the last dungeon, which starts your non-leveled heros up against three final bosses, I guess as a joke?"

Once you get familiar with the QuestRun, you can't stop playing - unless the art style bothers you. It's really important to check all the stats of your characters and when you're in the fight, alter their positions. Luck is also a very important factor which leads to the victory. If you'll get a nice, powerful item early in the game, most likely you'll win the level. Alter the position of your chars, use special powers often and watch your luck. QuestRun is a nice, casual game which helps me to relax. Congratulations to the creators for making such a nice little gem!"

Be careful what you unlock, because once you unlock an item or character or helper, it gets added to the rotation, which increases the randomness of any particular mage-fighter-helper combinations.The enemies level up faster than your characters. Your charcter gains don't carry over from level to level.2 characters - the priest and bard - are too weak to make it past the first fight 50%. Even if you devote all your resources to keeping them alive and leveled-up, they won't level up as fast as the enemies. And the vampire loses 2 hp/sec. He won't last past the third round. (There are about 50 rounds per level.)The only way to regain characters is to get potions, but getting positions is unlikely, and even then only brings them up to 25% health or so. There's no point in wasting a potion on a weaker character, and no point contnuing once a party is at less than full strength. On top of losing characters during battles, there are between-round ""fortunes/misfortunes. You could get an inventory full of potions, or you could lose one of your characters between rounds.This game really sets the gamer up to fail.I've played this"

Obviously you can't expect it to be some huge in-depth title but the side missions take some real thought to beat and learning a few stratagies for beating the dungeons adds to it.Yes, the game has simple combat, but you will be required to interact constantly in order to win(unless you use the cookie cutter builds/stratagies).As you level through combat you get to pick from random stats to raise each time, some luck comes to play in this, and with it you can aim for different outcomes....better items, defense, pure offense...etc"

I thought I was buying a casual game, but that's not what I got.Quest Run is a cute game that doesn't try to be anything grand, and it succeeds at what it does.  You have several different classes of adventurers with limited equipment slots and skills, some ability to maneuver them, and a couple of random events - and that's about it.  The art style is pleasing, and it's easy to pick up in a short time.However, the game is punishing.  I was shocked when, in the middle of a tutorial, my entire party was slaughtered.  That was a taste of things to come: I soon found that trying to go beyond the two tutorial dungeons meant losing every single time - hardly a lot of fun, or what I expected.  You did gain some gold from each attempt, fail or succeed, but that's it - nothing else stayed with you.  There was no sense of levelling up your characters or equipment - in fact, you were assigned different characters in each dungeon, meaning that you didn't really get to know their strengths and weaknesses without replaying the raid.  A lot.And you have to replay a lot: there are some upgrades you can buy, like pets with abilities or additional classes, but they cost thousands of gold pieces - and you get around 150 for finishing a quest.  If you need an upgrade to seize victory, then you're going to have to replay the same raid dozens of times to save up enough - and then hope that it was worth it, since the descriptions are vague at best.I get the impression that QuestRun is a lot like FTL or Rogue Legacy, both roguelike games in which there is a steep learning curve, and you're not expected to survive to the end of the game until you've put dozens of hours into it.  There certainly is a skill to playing QuestRun, as you come to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each class and try out different strategies.  I just with the game held your hand a little more, or that you had the chance to play through a quest or two that wasn't a tutorial without having your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by the game.  Otherwise, you end up feeling like the developer is laughing at your feeble efforts, and that's hard to enjoy.In the end, QuestRun is a good game, but not a game I can enjoy.  I wanted something that would be fun from the beginning, and instead I got a game that requires a lot of time and effort.  A lot of people will enjoy that, but I have other games I play when I want that.  I don't feel ripped off, but I wish I'd read the forums before buying."

Each hero has a different effect, special attack and stats. Some are tanky, some are powerful and all of them has an advantage and a disadvantage. Heroes are only able to attack their enemy if they are standing infront of them. Killing an enemy will grant them 1 xp ball. Having 3 of them will make them level up. The special bar will be slightly filled by each hit on an enemy and you are able to activate it once it is full. Sadly the game is really unbalanced as it is totally luck dependant and on top of that totally automated. The only thing what you have to do is rotate heroes position, use the special bar and equip them with better items. The battles are ""Speed"" turn based, so the higher the speed faster you are able to attack again. There are random events that can TOTALLY ruin your run. Like for in example, You are able to choose between ""party member is instant death, or all items has been stolen"". The negative events are showing up more often than positive ones. Monsters are getting powerful quickly.Unbalanced.Not enjoyable.No progression feelings at all.Ingame tutorial.Grindfest and luck based.Randomized hero re-roll.Poor stats upgrade per level.

The upgrades to your characters are temporary, giving you very little option to customise your characters to make them stronger.  Basically your ability to win relies on RNG, which is just time consuming and makes for very boring, repetitive gameplay until you actually find yourself winning."

Very quickly bored.Very little action or actual choice involved, as you can begin a dungeon and leave the computer to go do whatever it is you do with food in a kitchen- mostly thanks to the lack of strategy, events, or just about anything interesting. At all.The animation of the figures appears to keep changing, and I was at first fooled into thinking that the game was running at about 5FPS, when Fraps said 60. I don't even know how they pulled that off.The music is boring and repetative, and I kind of want to strangle whoever made that design choice.Actually, it reminds me of the first Final Fantasy game released in the US; you know, the rubbish one where you basically pressed A throughout the entire thing and read a magazine off to the side.This is exactly the same as that, except with even less required effort on the part of the player.Shameful.On the positive side, you can... Play it? I don't actually....Oh, yes; trading cards!Wait, I don't care about those... never mind.Cheers!-Camolot"

My friends will say a game is terrible and i'll defend it,  because I have bad taste.With that said, this is a terrible game. I hate to be one of those ""omg a mobile app game!!!"" because I don't care. That's a dumb complaint and those are dumb threads, so stop posting them, but this is a game where if you made that thread, i'd agree with you.It doesn't translate well on a computer at all because gameplay consists of switching spots occassionally with your three characters and waiting for them to ever so slowly kill the thing in their way (It's so bad that even the 3x Speed battles take minutes), only to do the same thing again.And again.And again.If you got this game in a bundle, just idle for the cards and delete this game from your harddrive and never look back.I play these types of games when I am trying to fall asleep since I have sleep issues, but this game is boring it's bad boring.. or maybe badoring. I may call Merriam-Webster to see if I can get that word into the next dictionary.Anyway. Please don't buy this game. Donate the money to charity instead. Donate it to a Multiple Sclerosis charity... any charity. Just don't buy this game. Even if the Steam sale is 90% off. That money is better going to charity."

The play style is interesting. First off when you die you lose and start over again, the second thing that makes this game enjoyable is you can swap characters to different positions at will. So if you have a healer and a tank, and your healer is taking too much dammage you can swap places with the tank. Another interesting feature is items, you have 4 slots on the left side of the screen that can hold an item, every round you pass you gain an item. The items quality is based off of a certain stat, which is unique because you can literally upgrade your fighters during battle. There are other aspects to the game that make it unique, I have to admit like others I was dissapointed when my fighters auto attacked, but after playing for a bit I understand why the game was created this way. It can be fast paced and requres your attention at every turn, constant micro management is a must and being forced to tell one of your fighters to attack would be detramental."

,Recommended,286120,12154488,"Posted: 19 September, 2014",all,Onions,"Its kinda like a roguelike.  You roll a random party of 3 seperate classes through different dungeons and challenges--What few there are will take a few tries to beat since the game doesn't go easy on you.  The game is simple in that you reposition lanes, activate character spells, switch stances (which can buff the unit or even team at a personal stat cost) and use items as you knock out wave after wave of baddies. Characters level up in these runs and you up their stats and try to finish the dungeon.Is it a good game?  Sure.  Its not a $9 game though. Catch it on sale for $3 or less and it'll be a nice casual time waster."

I managed to beat it, and for me I do not beat many games.It is relatively short in comparison to others, there is some replayability if you did not manage to beat a challenge or two but did beat the campaign. If you are not good at management then this may pose a challenge as it is turn/time based, your team will automatically attack - they have abilities you can activate and equipment to switch around, they level up (you do not keep the level moving on to the next challenge, but it is all part of it because you can level up different characters accordingly and try different combinations of levels if you did not succeed)It brought me hours of enjoyment."
