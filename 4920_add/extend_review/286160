,Recommended,286160,32524346,Posted: 17 June,all,Steel,"(Edit 2: For the people who don't find my review helpful: That's okay. We all have opinions.)(Edit: Thank you guys for the support on my review, since I wasn't expecting it to get this much attention. That means a lot to me.)Want a good laugh while playing ""Cards Against Humanity""? You want to play ""Monopoly"" with strangers online? Ever wanted to flip the table when you lose a game? This is the game for you!Tabletop Simulator is an amazing simulator that does it's job right. It's not like ""Goat Simulator"" that you are paying money for a joke that gets old after 5 minutes, it's actually a true simulator.There is so much stuff to do in this game, because thanks to Workshop, you can play any Board/Card game there is. You want to make your own game? You can do that, and share it to Workshop for others to play. There is endless amount of games, gameplay, and fun here it's worth the money it's asking. Nothing much to say here.My experience with the community so far has been quite positive. There were some people who call me a ""f**"" just because I told them in the next round they can play. But other than that, if I didn't know how to play the game a server is doing, the host teaches me. The community tries to make the game fun, and I like that. No kids screaming into their microphones just because they lost a round, and throwing a fit. For a game this popular, this is the best community I've experienced so far for a multiplayer title.Not saying there isn't trolls, but if there is one in your game, and they mess up everything, you can ban them from your server and Undo the actions the troll did. The makers made the game more Troll-free than any other multiplayer titles with the smart choice of the Undo option.Speaking about options, there is a lot of options for hosts to run their servers. You can turn off flipping table, object spawning, and much more. So if you don't want your server to get out of hand, you can turn some options off, and let the games begin!The controls are a bit awkward at times, but with a little bit of practice, they aren't all that difficult, and easy to learn. If you use a XBOX controller, it's a bit more challenging, but it's still easy to control. I use my Steam Controller for this game, and they did a good job on mapping the controls.I know there is a lot more, but it's quite hard to get everything into words since there is so much to see and do. You have to experience the game yourself to see what I mean.TL;DR: Tabletop Simulator is a simulator done right. For 20 dollars, you get to play any Board/Card game with an amazing community. This is the most fun multiplayer experience I've ever been in.Highly Recommended!"

So we tried everything from reinstalling the game and the drivers to changing the launch options but none of that worked. But support did not give up. They tried to help me for about 3 months before I got the great Idea to start up the game in VR mode. I managed to change back the resolution to normal (without VR gear) and now everything works again!If it were not for the support of Berserk Games I would have given up hope long ago.

,Recommended,286160,17633396,"Posted: 20 August, 2015",all,Monukai,"This is easily the most recommendable game in my library at the moment. Obviously if you aren't interested in tabletop games or are of the ""I rather play with real life friend's"" crowd it may not be for you, but otherwise there is no reason not to be eyeballing this game.As a simulator it's quite robust. I've found a few small issues here and there but these are minor and don't really make themselves felt until you've played for a considerable amount of time (50+ hours). So far though there hasn't been a game I've tried to play in Tabletop Simulator that I was unable to play due to limitations of the simulator, and although there are a few games I can think of that would be harder to play in this simulator, the vast majority of games play just fine.That being said, the workshop content of this game is what makes it so recommendable. The basic package comes with classic games like Chess and Checkers, but if you delve into the workshop you'll find tons of great games available at the click of a button. Some copyrighted favorites are regularly taken down due to DMCA strikes, but plenty are not (and plenty of Kickstarter backed games allow their games to be uploaded). Take a gander over to the workshop page for this game and search/browse before buying it, I'm sure you'll find more than a few games you like there.Lastly, this game is great with friends, whether they are friends you know in real life or oversea buddies. Grab a mic and a few friends and start working through that workshop content, if you're able to do this I guarantee you'll be happy with your purchase. If that's not possible, I've made my way into a few public games and have had a pretty okay experience there. Many pubs tend to have mics and usually one person is willing to explain to everyone the rules of the current game. I've had my occasional issue with the griefer who comes in and messes with everything but for the most part it's been pretty good. Plenty of tabletop games have solitaire modes as well, so even if playing with friends isn't an option all the time, you can always try your hand with solo play.I started playing Tabletop Simulator and I almost never played tabletop games, now a half year later since buying it I have 250 non-idle hours into this game and I've tried close to 50 different games out and have had a blast playing them all. It's even helped me find a few games that I'd definitely like to buy in person for when I do get the chance to play with real life friends. Get this game. It's worth it."

,Recommended,286160,12431816,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,Rex Draco,"As is, it is well worth the asking price if you have friends willing to join with you. If you are someone that loves the generic chess, checkers, backgammon, chinese checkers, etc. or if you absolutely love card games such as poker, solitare, or even go fish, this title delivers impressively. It is NOT a single player game, but you could (as mentioned) play solitare with the cards given to you.The game doesn't hold your hand. It gives you some luxory controls, but it otherwise wont tell you what you can and cannot do. As the video preview shows off, this garuntees chaos if you allow it to happen. This is more of a good thing (I think) than a bad thing, but it does cause somewhat frustrating experiences in the online play. Because it doesn't hold your hand, people might unintentially break the rules in various games or make some up of their own. This is a good thing for people in various cultures with different rules, not to mention those that want to play house rules (such as not having to jump in checkers, something you technically don't have to do if you are okay removing the piece, but programs force you to typically anyways). This is bad because complete anarchy is expected, it really is a simulator and, like real life, some disagreements are expected. Overall, I'd say it's a good thing despite the consequences; I believe you could say it's a double edge sword.In my opinion, this game's strongest advantage over anything else on Steam that demands much more money for such less content, such as any mediocre chess game on Steam, is the freedom this game gives you. Not just the ability to do virtually anything within reason like the first paragraph poked at a bit, but the ability to create custom games and downloading other's custom games. This, of course, inevitably means about 90% of the time COPYRIGHTED content. This is a huge blow over the board game and card game industry and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it.Just like the whole ""people don't want to buy music on the internet"" and then the same morons began wondering why music piracy began to rise, you can expect this tabletop simulator to have a significant role for a similar outcome in regards to board games and card games. We asked for a good *insert trading card game* simulator and we got ignored, maybe humored with half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥games instead, but now we have an alternative. Some copyright claims have been made, particularly Munchkin, this was to be expected but some are yet the wiser and either ignore this game or don't even realize it exists like (it seems) a good part of the gaming community... particularly the people willing to pay $50 for a chess simulator.Regardless, I wont ramble on about that nonsense that doesn't matter to us, the consumers (at least not until our ""freedoms"" start get taken away by lawyers that are smarter, yat greedier, than their own good). No, I will discuss further how custom work *kinda* works, as someone who puts in a heavy load of *cough*copyrighted material*cough*. It is very easy! For cards, you just make a huge picture and put all the cards on it, up to 69 specifically at the moment, and the game cuts it up into pieces. The downside? The quality will be♥♥♥♥♥♥unless it is a very big picture. To make matters worse, the game currently requires you to upload said giant image to a random website for everyone to download it from. This is bad, because there isn't exactly a variety of file hosts to use that would allow such a huge file. I currently use dropbox, but it gave me problems recently that I will forgive because I have nobody else to go through, but I will never forget. With that said, it would be nice if Tabletop Simulator uses an alernative last resort file sharing method, have it between the players.Why wouldn't the game do this from the start? Well, there is the possibility of saving file types with specific names and the game will, for now on, load that specific file instead of the original. If you had it so the game will send the files the players have, this could result in exploits that involve offensive or otherwise illegal materials most of us don't want to see. So, I agree not to have this as a primary form of getting files, but it would be nice to be able to download from the host or whoever upload the item and maybe keep track of the steam id that gave that specific file to you, that way reporting is an option. Hopefully the TTS devs will consider this as a solution to the problem, assuming this problem was the reason they avoided the option of peer to peer file transfer.The game offers so much, but like any early access games, bugs are expected. They fixed quite a few recently, but some still exist. Despite all of them, the game is well worth it. However, I cannot stress it enough that you plan to do this with friends, for randoms only play a handful of games.tl;dr:Pros:Freedom. For something that is just on a single table, it feels as big as a sanbox (I'm exaggerating, but for what's worth, you have building blocks, something you'd see sometimes in a real life sandbox)Variety. You get a lot for what you paid for. Try to look up chess games on Steam.Customization. You can make your own games or copy and paste something else... probably copyrighted most likely. Because of this, you can play virtually anything you dreamed of having in your childhood for the price that is TTS.Online. You can play board games with loved ones from far away, or with near by friends that don't want to spend hundreds on trading cards or RPG materials.There is some anti griefing options in place, but maybe we could use more.Cons:There isn't a whole lot of people in the community, a lot of them are griefers.Players currently cannot just pull card decks out of workshop items without loading it, something that is addressed for other items.Lack of file transfering between players with custom items. Of course, this is probably to prevent porn to be traded around rather than monopoly board images by ""mistake,"" but this is something the devs should look into.Overall, this game is splended. We have building blocks, but could someone for the love of god add in some plastic army men?This isn't the kinda game you wait for a sale for, this is the kinda game you buy with only one regret: not buying it sooner.9/10 seems fair, but it will be different for everyone. I ♥♥♥♥ing love Monopoly, Yugioh, Coupe, Tsuro, Chess, Poker, etc. so I make the most of this game. For those that are not so into all of that, maybe you wont make the most of it like I do. Regardless, buy it. Seriously... buy it.Edit:Players, including non hosts, can now upload their trading card decks. Initially, only hosts were able to lost from saved chest items but that is no longer the case. Because of this update, I removed this from the cons list.It has come to my attention that someone made software on the forums that indeeds allows hosts to send card deck files to others from their own computer. Clearly the game is capable, but I do not personally know the details behind this. I just wish to point it out that it's possible, but I still will leave it under cons due to it being unoffical software and the game doesn't seem to even hint the possibility as well, again, I don't know the details in how it works.It is worth noting that there is now a tutorial added to the game. It, however, does not teach you absolutely everything players may want to know in the game. Things I recall not being taught includes locking and unlocking items, the L key, changing object sizes with the -/+ keys, or how to navigate the menus which might be a confusing part of the game to newer players. I mention this in regards to my initial comment that this game doesn't hold your hand. Still doesn't, but better.Hosts can now customize server settings fluently, so removed from cons."

Through the power of Steam Workshop as well as a lot of well-done built-in assets, you can essentially make any tabletop experience you so desire. Want to make your own card game? Go for it! Want to create your own intricate RPG of some description? You can do that with animated monster figurines! The possibilities are literally infinite.The hosting capabilities of TTS are also really well done. You can kick and/or ban people from your server easily, and you can restrict certain things from being possible within your server. Anyone you've banned is sent to a personal blacklist for any servers you host in the future. If you host anything related to the Steam Workshop, anyone who joins will automatically download the necessary files without having to be subscribed to that particular mod at all. It's one of the most robust systems I've seen.Even the game's DLC, thankfully, follows that last rule. Originally, Tabletop Simulator had a weird hybrid system of everyone owning DLC or just the host or whatever. It was convoluted, and it's been changed to a much simpler system that works like the Steam Workshop. Only the host needs to own the DLC. It makes everything so easy!The only gripe I have is that mod files do take a long time to load, but obviously this depends on the size of the mod and where the images are being hosted. It's really apparent on larger mods, though. But every release has seen improvements to the game's performance, and mod loading has gotten smoother and smoother, so this isn't as much of an issue as when I first wrote this review.Prior to originally writing this, for the record, I had spent two hours in a heated Uno game with 7 random people I had never met before, and all of us were having immense fun. Never in my entire life had I thought that would be possible.If you like playing tabletop games of any kind, you owe it to yourself to purchase this and get your friends in as well.

,Recommended,286160,14652690,"Posted: 25 February, 2015",all,Armani,"This is one of the absolute best purchases I've ever made on Steam - its basically an infinite collection of board games. See a game you haven't played in forever? Play it. Want to know if that boardgame you want to buy is any good? Try it. Have an urge to have a lazy conversation with your gf/wife but want to do something while you talk? Load up a random game and try it out. Feeling down? Join a server and proceed to have shenangins with people.The only criticism I have for this game isn't even because of the game itself (the developers are fantastic and are (as I type this) updating the features of the simulator. Its the community. Some people enter lobbies and ruin games. Not with all that much frequency, mind you, but enough so that most people now lock their servers. A handful of open (and legitimate) servers are still around, but its like 5% - 10% of the servers listed. So if your planning on playing without a real life friend or two..... I'd still say get the game (seriously its fantastic), but don't expect to play anything but popular card games.UPDATE AS OF 6/24/16 --Game is in excellent shape, workshop is alive and kicking, and the content in the game is very nicely set. Honestly, its a complete masterpiece as a game.On a different note, I'd like to take a minute to talk about the community. Tabletop has probably one of the best communities for what it is: the game attracts essentially only people who enjoy board games. So your playing a game about playing any board game you desire, with a bunch of people who love board games. Its great, like 80% of the time. 20% of the time you'll be stuck waiting (for people to join games), or playing games your not super into, or getting trolls (who are easy to ban). The server issue still exists, about 80% to 90% of servers are locked and at any give time your looking at 15 to around 30ish open lobbies.I personally think those are decently acceptable statistics. And tabletop is a great place to make friends - I've added at least 30 people in the last 3 months alone from this game. These are people I spent a MINIMUM of 2 hours laughing, chatting and playing with over a game of Risk, Battlestar, Monopoly, or any of over 200 games I've personally subscribed to. The game is honestly a great way to get out there and hang out with people you'd otherwise never meet.TL;DR -A Steam Must-buy, especially if you have real life friends who also have the game. 10/10 Monopoly Boards."

It seems the https client is only able to download assets from https servers running SSLv3.SSLv3 has been deprecated since the October 14, 2014, so the Linux version of this game has been broken for over two years at this point. Many of the most popular game assets are stored on https-only web servers which makes it impossible to play many of the games available in the online multiplayer lobby without manually downloading the assets outside of TTS.So far the devs seem to be blaming upstream game engine issueswhich isn't really acceptable for something as simple as scripting https requests."
,Recommended,286160,19578761,"Posted: 8 December, 2015",all,Lina Maidevoir,"EDIT: I still recommend this game, but nice players are far and few between.  I'm mute IRL and I can't speak because of that, so it's pretty saddening to have people use voice chat to confused others about what actions I did and then laughing when you ask them to stop. :/  Pretty much every game with an element of deception (which is nearly every tabletop game ever) is unplayable for me because of this.  The only upside is nearly no game has rules for if someone wants to quit playing in the middle of the game, so when people do that to me, I just leave and ♥♥♥♥ it up for everyone.So, I think the only way to describe this game is to explain what happened in my first three hours.Bought the game, started it up, played through the tutorial.  I then went to tools and started playing with that, to learn how the tools work.  One is literally a shared web browser.  If you don't realize how powerful that is, then you've got problems.After learning a bit of the tools and such, I then went through the browser to find a server to watch.  I found two people playing risk, so I started watching them.  Turns out, their risk board was bugging out, so they changed the game to catan.Only problem is, one of them didn't know how to play catan.We taught them how to play through the entire game, and we had zero issues with fustration or anything of the sort.Confusion over whose turn it was on the other hand.. Yeah.  That's when the host spawned in a miniature and said ""Pass this when your turn is over.""In real life, Catan is the kind of game where turns could never end.  You can sit there for hours braindead trying to figure out all the possibilities, at least, wheny ou're new to the game.We started doing our turns in sequence much faster, and we were collecting resources.  I was about to trade in 4 of a kind for one resource, as you do when you play with people who don't understand the concept of economics at all.  People I know in real life.That's when they traded resources.  1 to 1.I have never traded resources 1 to 1 in a game of catan.  The people I play with IRL always give you an option.  Either you let them win, or you play a painfully hellish game in hopes of getting the resource you need.And so, we continued to trade resources 1 to 1 back and forth and build.For the first time, I actually played a game of catan in which the building phase wasn't dragged out over the course of the entire game.We kept the table clean through the item bags and the entire game went easily.Finally, someone reached 10 points, which signals the end of the game in Catan.  The person who won was the one who didn't know how to play at the start.And during all of this, the giant button that says ""FLIP TABLE"" taunted us all.  And none of us clicked it, despite the fustrations a game of catan can cause.100/100, would play with anonymous people who are nicer than my RL friends again."

But Tabletop Simulator does more than that which makes it more appealing.You could play chess with a friend for example. You move a piece, he moves, you take is knight, he takes your queen, then you throw a rook at his king. Literally. And your friend, so enfused with rage of you being a cheating conniving jerk, flips the table in anger, scattering the pieces to oblivion. Then you try a new game. Ludo perhaps. Adding the necessary parts; marbles, dice, mahjong tiles, RPG Dragon...This is one of those games which may look serious, but seen from a different perspective and you have something that can be a great laugh for everyone. All the more, you can make your own games and put them directly into TS for everyone to try out. Which, to paraphrase NerdCubed, makes it an ideal platform for board game makers to test out their new games before they make physical copies. There is a lot that can be done, it's quite astonishing.There is online multiplayer so you can play with friends across the web. Wouldn't mind seeing local hot-seat multiplayer in a future update, if it hasn't already been included.If you haven't bought this game, I highly recommend you do.

That is, you can play tabletop games with it in the manner you would a physical tabletop game on a physical table.Currently TTS has all of the features needed to play nearly any type of tabletop game: board, war, card, rpg and so on. New features are added almost weekly. The developers (Berserk Games) are doing a great job adding substantial features, while also paying attention to the player's suggestions. If there's an issue with an update, you can typically expect a hotfix released within a very short time to fix it. They are easily one of the most on-task developers I've seen on an early access title.The controls can be slightly unwieldy until you get a handle on them. Once you play with it for a bit, it'll become easy and a lot of fun. Rolling dice and manipulating pieces is a much more tactile and enjoyable experience then other digital tabletop applications.Don't expect there to be AI or automation, TTS is meant to simulate the actual tabletop experience. Meaning you will need other players to play with. There is an online lobby to find other players, you can also direct connect to a friend or use the offline hotseat mode if you want to play a game with a local friend.Overall, I would highly recommend TTS to fans of tabletop games. It's great, and will only get better. Casual tabletop gamers should also enjoy TTS, as there are a lot of game mods that cater to them as well."
,Recommended,286160,13245683,"Posted: 5 December, 2014",all,Tyrnom,"When I initially bought this about a year ago, I felt ripped off. I had paid $15 and the game didn't even work. It would constantly CTD with out of memory errors when I've got 12 gigs of RAM and 1 gig of VRAM; which is not the best, but entirely functional. So I gave it a few months for them to update and iron out the issues, and by that time it worked. It was well worth the purchase.This is a game where you can play pretty much any tabletop game in existence. It comes with a few such as chess, checkers, chinese checkers, poker (in the style of Texas holdem), backgammon, and several others. If you want to play another type of game using the components, you can do that. There's no rules here; it's just the players and the components. If someone is losing at chess, they can chuck a piece at their opponent in frustration, perhaps knocking over the king and a couple pawns. If you want to reach over and steal some cards from your opponent's hand, you can; though you'll probably upset them in the process, and they're more than likely to take them back from you. If you don't know how to play chess, bugger all; move with the pieces however you want, throw the pieces, do whatever. This isn't to imply that the community is a bunch of savages that don't care one mote about the rules; quite the antithesis.I've found that most people whom sit down to play a game like chess, poker, or any other game tend to play by the rules of the game they're playing. Sometimes you have someone who doesn't know the rules and they have to be explained, which is fine; but every once in a rare while you have the person who gives no damns whatsoever, comes in, and starts throwing things everywhere and attempting to flip the table, ruining the game for everyone else. Luckily the admin can kick and ban troublesome players, so this is seldom a problem in public games, and much less so if you're just playing with friends.This game is extremly flexible in what it can do. One of the things I like to play most with my friends on this is a card game called gin rummy. There's not any predefined mode for gin rummy here. Instead, I have to go to a 'chest', which is a tab where the admin can spawn in pretty much anything they want, including custom components. From here I can spawn in a standard deck of 52 playing cards, explain the game to my friends if necessary, and go. That's all there is to it.If you're decent at creating your own images or modelling, the game allows you to load in custom cards and pieces and ergo make up your own game with your own rules. If you're not, then this game has a wonderful Steam community workshop feature wherein you can browse other user created games. Pretty much every board game you can imagine can be found here, and this allows for a lot of freedom in what players can actually play. Most video-games are simple; they have a set paradigm that the player cannot change, or can barely change using mods. For example, a video-game that's designed to be just an Uno game or a game designed to be just a chess game are nothing less, nothing more - they offer the experience they want the player to have and that's it. Tabletop Simulator to an extent has these limitations, of course; it's not an ""everything"" simulator, it's a tabletop simulator - but that range is extremely broad, and within that context you can do whatever you want, either using its predefined pieces, creating your own, or finding some really epic games in the community workshop (Eels and Escalators, anyone?). It's not a game that says ""Do this or else."", or a game makes you lose half an hour of progress because you completed an objective incorrectly; heck, it's not even a gamewithobjectives. It's just a game that gives you a whole plethora of pieces and says ""Have fun."", and for that it's one of my all-time favourites."

This is fantastic for anyone, like me, who has no local friends, but still has the urge to play things like Monopoly or Connect 4.Keeping in mind that almost anything that is a licensed game is not in the main title. You can still find basic card decks, D&D style figures and almost any kind of dice you could ask for, among many other things. The amount of detail given to the controls and options is astounding as well. Basic physics on items, but it certainly does the job!However, the meat comes with the workshop. What the developers cannot do legally, the community can do, and for free! This is certainly the greatest part of Tabletop. Not only the licensed games that are available, but people being given the ability to be creative and make their own games or rules, if they so choose!Quite honestly worth the price if you and/or some friends are really interested in playing board/card/D&D-style games, but distance or ability to get together in one spot proves to be an issue."

,Recommended,286160,10266154,"Posted: 28 May, 2014",all,Markimus,"After following this up from Greenlight, this game is truly incredible. The amount of fun you can have with people from around the world is immense. The Steam Workshop really adds a level of creativity to the game.People can make their own games from Uno to Monopoly. They can create their own special versions of games, like a unique Nintendo Monopoly, or a Minecraft Monopoly. I am currently the owner of three Workshop Items. The possibilities are really endless.People can import these games and host a Multiplayer server for up to eight people from around the world. Of course if you live further away you're going to have more server lag unless the host has amazing internet. Currently LAN support is not available, but that's not a feature I usually use in games anyway. You can set passwords for your game room for a private match. You can disable table flip, hands for non-card games. There used to be a problem where people would join a game, table flip and leave, but now the game has a delay before a person can do that even if table flip is on. There are really a lot of options.Rules are enforced by the host, simply meaning if they don't play properly then why would they allow them in the room? The host can kick/ban a player, or mute a player if they're squeaking or something through their microphone.The people on this game are mostly friendly. To filter out annoying people though you can put ""(mic)"" or ""(mic needed)"" in the title, then you can ask them if they can talk when they join the game. People are usually nicer when they have to speak to others with their voice rather than text speak. Seat requesting has been suggested before but has not been added yet.The single player version of this can be played on your own or with others if you share a mouse. This isn't really something I'm too interested in either. This mode is usually the place where people make custom games designed for multiplayer, or simply to get used to controls and mess around. Of course there are single player games you can play, if that's what you're in to, like Solitaire.The physics in this game is really fun to play with to. There is a gravity multiplier which changes the gravity effect of objects in-game. People have made tabletop tennis with a coin. Throwing things around, watching things fly off as you flip the table.  Rolling a dice around a game board. Everything is really well done.I get the most fun though out of talking to people through microphone. Talking through chat just doesn't cut it for me, especially in a silent game as it currently has no game music. I enjoy arguing with people over competetive games such as Story War and Once Upon A Time. I recommend you get a microphone before getting this game in order to have a better game experience, unless you just want to play quiet games.Performance wise the game is excellent, and should run on low-end computers as well as high-end. All the game really has to load is a single table and the amount of things on the table. Performance will likely droop if you're hosting though, but for me this doesn't really show any considerable FPS change. The game looks good on Medium to Ultra, but starts to look bad if you go any lower. (Not that you should need to.)Unfortunately there are tabletop games which are just not possible to recreate at the moment such as Mouse Trap or Dingbats, but hopefully due to the fast updates this game has these games should be possible to recreate in a few weeks/months or so.The developers are amazing and listen to the community. My best advice would be to ask/suggest things on the Berserk Games forum as that's where they mostly hang out. They push out a new update every week or so with new and fun features for the community to try out and squashed bugs. It's great fun being a part of the Early Access community and helping to shape the game into a game everyone would want to be a part of.If you're interested, you should watch some videos and see what all the fuss is about.Anyway, I highly recommend this unique game for anyone who likes playing tabletop games in real life (which is pretty much everyone). This has great replayability.10/10 - Fun!"

But this is enough to open up unlimited possibilities for boardgame geeks, don't let the screenshots from the store fool you! This sim can handle way more than Chess, Checkers and other common stuff you'll find online en masse.That said, the workshop support is the heart of this application, because it allows modders to recreate every boardgame, cardgame, tabletop or physically existing game. Lots of historical stuff you'll never get your hands on (except you're willing to pay high collector's prices) like games from Avalon Hill or those nasty american nuclear-themed games from the atomic age.Here's a random selection of well-done workshop items you should try out:- Advanced Civilization- Bohnanza (popular german cardgame)- Carcasonne- Settlers of Catan (including Star Trek mod)- Risk (LotR-mod / Star Wars-mod and more)- Exploding Kittens- Zombie Dice- Starship Troopers (based on the novel, not on the movie)- Alien- Fallout-Monopoly- Escape from Colditz- X-Wing Miniature Game- Warhammer- HotelThere are no limits: Scan your favorite game's cards, reference sheets and rules, import 3D-Models and preserve this stuff for all times.

Not only did the TS version cut down on setup/dismantle time, it happened to be a functional and more convenient way to play the game, even with people over distances. One of the most magical parts about board gaming is that you are face-to-face with the other players and get to interact with them in person while you're playing the game. Unfortunately, given our busy schedules and the distances between us, we are not always able to meet in person and lay out our games on common table. TS gives people a chance to play board games virtually, conveniently, and practically, wherever they may be, and cuts down on the prep time which makes these games more accessible to us board game enthusiasts. In addition, TS also has just about every single board game out there available for download on the workshop or as top-quality DLC from the steam store. Without further ado, here's to many more hours of tabletop gaming to look forward to! And to be clear, I fully recommend this game if you're into board games!!!"

I've modded workshop items, joined communities, even been inspired to go to physical locations to play board games and to buy physical ones.... It's been a lot of fun. This thing definitely needs a tablet version, a console version, and maybe even a mobile version."

Why wouldn't you want to indoctrinate all your online friends into the elite ranks of hobby gamers. Why wouldn't you want to play any game in your physical library (via workshop mods) with literally seconds of load time and setup (with scripted setup mods).This game is an easy buy even at full price. I have played a few games of Dead of winter with a close friend who playing tabletop with is impractical due to distance. Solo Eldritch horror with no setup breakdown thanks to scripts has made the game playable for me on weeknights when I don't have the time to whip out the full set and set it all up. Save function is a lifesaver as well.The controls are a little fiddly but managable. The backgrounds... the setting you are playing in is notably ridiculous: alleys, meadows, stupid places that games would never be played in.Just having a workshop full of any hobby game you can dream of is worth 10x the sticker price for this game. You can playtest anything before buying it. Disclaimer: not anything, most things. Descent second edition seems to be a hard one to find a good workshop upload. Miniature games are harder to scan I am sure.I really enjoy just opening up games and messing around with the components. I definitely prefer learning games with a physical copy. I find it incredibly fiddly to learn games on here. The tablet for rules could use some improvement. I can't get PDFs from google to open properly. Having like a television sized object that has it's own PDF viewer or chrome built in would be insanely useful. Rules appear so small, and it kind of sucks. Being able to upload PDFs into the notes could solve this problem too. I hate opening a game and seeing a bunch of links for rules and youtube vids.The DLC is pretty worthless. There are 2 games on there I am slightly interested in and I have the same issue learning those as any other game on TTS. I need a physical copy of sycthe and Zombicide if I am going to play and teach on TTS.Overall this game, with it's flaws and room for growth is an obvious buy if you are a table top gamer. Don't be stupid. Just buy it. This game is perfect for hobby gamers, even if you don't really play videogames. If you are a hobby gamer and only have 1 game in your steam library this should be it. Buy it. Play it. Now."

It doesn't require a lot of computer power to run and, with some coaching, may even be easy enough for your grandparents to use. Mine got the hang of chess anyway.

The sole purpose as to why I got this was for the Tabletop Roleplaying aspect of it. I am a Game Master and have found many ways to use this before or during my game sessions. I am the founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League, a Group that is made up of people, players of tabletop/pen and paper games, and I definitely recommend this to all fo them. Anyway, lets continue on to the pros and cons listsNOTE-This review is based solely on the RPG/Game Master features and uses for Tabletop Simulator.Pros-Unlimited Features, you can do literally do whatever you want to with this thing. If Tabletop Simulator doesn't have an asset that you need like a castle piece or knight model, you can just make one! It literally has unlimited potential for all of your Game Master needs.Consistent Updates, the developers are still expanding the base resources, specifically the RPG assets. This is great news for those interested in these assets, us Game Masters that is.Multiplayer, you can literally play your favorite tabletop game with your friends using this game, either through the internet or using hotseat gameplay. For the internet part, connecting is very easy and allows the Game Master to set the rules.Many others, but lets continue to cons...Cons-Complicated Controls, the controls are not to simple for beginners, remembering which button does what is hard early on. Once you have played with the controls for a while you will get a feel for them. The tutorial tells you how to use the controls, but thats about it.Inefficient Menus, finding the piece you are looking for takes to long, not because they are hard to find, but because you have to search through the menu, then sub menus, then more sub menus. It just takes to long, but I can live with it for now, although it would be nice to eventually change the menu set up. I guess you will never be able to reproduce a real tabletop session 100% in a virtual game.Conclusion-Overall, this is perhaps at the moment the best and most realistic means in recreating the actual feel of tabletop gaming, not just roleplaying games, but any game. I believe that this could eventually become the standard for PC tabletop roleplaying, and look forward to seeing what the developers do with this. This is a must have for any Game Master, or anyone who just really likes playing tabletop games!May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League"

I also like the feature where I can import my own playing cards or pieces or boards. Though I did try to make a disk type ""card"", I used a .png with a transparent background and when I imported the file, the transparency was filled with black making it a square card. I'm still trying to figure out the card importing thing, since when I imported a card type, it became very pixelated and illegible... But I've seen games on the Steam Workshop where the cards are very clean... SO - one of these days I'll get that result.

I was initially hesitant to buy it for the $20 price tag and wanted to wait for it to come up for sale before getting it, but my group and I really wanted to get started on a Pathfinder campaign and I'm incredibly impatient. This has been worth every cent so far, There are an amazing number of really well done models on the workshop and building maps is much easier than I thought it would be. It's still time consuming, but once you get the hang of what to do and how to move and arrange pieces, it's really intuitive and works out really well.My campaign is going great. The players love it, and TTS really makes it feel like we're all around a table in a room together instead of miles apart. We've tried out lots of other tabletop programs to try and get the group going, but none of them felt as real as this one has and it's added a different element to tabletop gaming that other programs have fallen short of for me and my group. The controls make DMing so simple, and honestly the only thing I can think to improve right now would be the ability to draw more defined fog of war instead of just the squares. Workshop support is A+ and I have had zero problems retrieving items I've subscribed to.Overall, I cannot recommend this high enough to other pen and paper RPG groups. Having the 3d maps and being able to decorate the world with flavor items has been a real treat. I can honestly spend hours upon hours in game doing nothing but building."

I know not if this is an issue that can be fixed, though the preservation of decks when undoing actions would be really nice to see.In regards for suggesting features, I would like to see the implementation of books (perhaps imported from documents on your hard drive?), though one might question the feasibility of such an implementation because at the end of the day, Tabletop Simulator is really just a physics sandbox with a few features to help simulate card, tabletop, and/or board games and I understand if the pages of said books would prove far too taxing on the game's physics engine.Other than that one gripe and suggestion I have, I have yet to notice any jarring issues besides the one above so yes, I can safely recommend this game as it does what it does really frickin' well."

It can also be played hot seat as many folks turn by turn in the same house.

,Recommended,286160,13435626,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,Danny,"Tabletop Simulator is essentially a game that involves... well.. tables. All you're really given is a table and a sandbox environment to play around with. For some games, this works wonderfully. For others, maybe not so much. With an astounding catalogue of games available in the Steam Workshop, it's very hard to pass up this game.Something I have to note is that this game is really only fun with friends. I don't think the single player portion of this game is even remotely fun or entertaining. Its only purpose in reality is probably for creating mods to put in the workshop. So if you don't have any friends to play this game with, you might have a hard time finding this enjoying. There are servers that you could just join in theory, but in my experience people tend to kick you out as soon as possible because you're interrupting their friends-only game.The controls of this game are fairly simple and quick to learn. They offer you a tutorial that allows you learn the controls in about 5 minutes so you can play right away. Right clicking on items brings up options such as dealing cards to all players, changing the tinting of the textures, and other miscellaneous options. From some of my friend's experience, the controls for the controllers leave something to be desired so I can't say I recommend it or not since I've never tried it. I have only heard bad things about it though.On the online side of things, the game provides many host options to allow the game to be in the forefront of attention. Some of the options that they allow you to turn on and off include:- Table flipping- Scaling of pieces- Locking of pieces- The notepad- Painting- Placing hidden areasAnd many more. So if you want to get down to the nitty gritty, this game allows you to set options that allow the main focus to be the game rather than messing around flipping the table and drawing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥all over the table. You are also allowed to set a password if you don't want non-friends to join.Installing mods is overall an easy process and with a huge selection I find it hard to really say anything bad about this game. There are multiple guides on the steam community page that teaches you how to make mods, but even that process is incredibly simple. It just requires some URLs and that's it.Overall I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing tabletop games with their friends."

During the 2017 Steam Summer Sale I went ahead and bought a 4 pack for 30 dollars, and it was well worth it. The next day on of the best moments of this game happened, and it made me instantly fall in love. Me and someone I just met off of some of my other friends wanted to play, and I did too, and I thought Monopoly, and he said yeah. After that, we played for 4 hours straight, laughing, having a good time, getting to know each other, and by the end of those 4 hours I felt like iv'e known him for the longest time, it was a great bonding expereince, and it was thanks to Tabletop Simulator. There will also be nights where there will be 4 or 5 of us wanting to play a card game and a have a good time. Many times yelling at each other playing Uno, or laughing playing Apples and Apples. Stragitizing playing Skip Bo, or spending hours trying to find waldo in 4 boards, theres been many of times in this game where it was fun, and it felt really real, even though we were just on a computer screen, this is why I love this game. But one thing about this game finally made me love it so much, and its the simplest thing, but it's so amazing. Puzzles. After I go to work and come back at almost 10:00 at night, I boot up my Indie Alternative playlist, find my favorite picture of nature, and spend 2 hours putting together the 140 peice puzzle, the whole world around me just stops, except for my playlist, and the puzzle, and it's the best thing ever, nothing has ever felt so relaxing before, and it's so great, this is why I love Tabletop Simulator. It can be a bonding expereince, a social get together, or on the of the most realaxing moemnts of your day, and this is why it's one of the most amazing games out there.Final ThoughtsThis game is amazing, it's everything I wanted out of 30$, the graphics are great, the audio is great, the immersion is there, it's a great game, and it's worth it if you:Enjoy doing things such as puzzles.Want to have a virtual cardgame session with your friends at 1:00 in the morning.Want to yell at each other over eels and escolatorsWant to draw D***KS all over the Candyland people and laugh for minutes.Want to enjoy your friends company in one of the most timeless methods.With these thoughts, I think that Tabletop Simulator grabs a 9.5/10. I love it, but it's not 10/10 because its notperfect.Thank you for reading."

From what I've seen on the Forums, the Devs are going to update content (a tape measure is one of the ones they've talked about...for miniature gaming), so this is going to add even more variation to the creation and game play.  I love the physics involved in the game, things like picking up and moving the pieces, shuffling cards, rolling dice, and even flipping the table (yes...that flipping the table).The Bad:  It's Early Access...it's effectively a beta...so right now, you pretty much have the basic stuff in the game.  There is a thread on the Forums regarding the use of copyrighted material...this can hamper some of the more popular ""games"" being reproduced.The Ugly:  The ""game room"" is...well...empty...there's the table...but no walls, no floor...just the table (this is something that is added later).That's really it...I enjoy the games so far, I hope that more is added in and that copyright holders allow for their products to be added to the Steam Workshop (when that's added)."

,Recommended,286160,17355373,"Posted: 2 August, 2015",all,Spooky Veggie,"First off, let me start by saying I've been playing Table Top Simulator with it was in Early Access. Now that Table Top Simulator is out of E.A. I felt like I could write my review of the game. Table Top Simulator is a great sandbox! The community and mods are fantastic! I mainly use Table Top Simulator for my D&D group, during our sessions. All I need is Table Top Simulator, my laptop, and a TV. Using all the wonderful mods in Steam Workshop, I can create great 3-D dungeons, towns, and etc for my players. Uploading mods to the Steam Workshop is with ease, in my D&D group we have a player whose been working on models for our D&D games and exciting to see what she develops. Using Table Top Simulator is a great visual for encounters and dungeons, among a long list of other things.  We've even used Table Top Simulator for playing our D&D sessions even over the internet, all in the comfort of our own homes. It ran really smooth and there was little to no issues we encountered. The Dev's also release updates quite often and it's exciting what new content they add.I don't only use it for D&D, though that's what I mainly use it for. Users have been able to upload, in the Steam Workshop, actual board games. Such games as Star Wars: X-WING, Beytral At The House On The Hill, Settlers Of Catan, and etc. It makes playing games with friends easy and still as fun as if you all got together. I would be lying though, if I said it didn't take away the feeling of actually interacting with your friends and seeing their emotions. Although Table Top Simulator has made playing games with friends over the internet easy and fun, it still cannot replace the moments of sitting at your dinning table and playing all together. Given that, I would still recommend Table Top Simulator, 10/10."

After all, you couldn't give it all the flexibility of a real table.Suffice it to say, I was amazed when I first tried this game. It is simple and intuitive and offers almost unlimited flexibility. The Workshop content is a HUGE plus. I was amazed when I found Dice Masters had already been made by someone else so now I can play it with friends and family across the world. I was also quite surprised (in a good way) to find a game I had previewed at PAX and had been wanting to play again for a while now.

Monopoly, Cards Against Humanity, Risk, UNO, Scrabble, Candy Land, Sorry!, the list goes on.There are even different themes for games. Nintendo Monopoly, Sonic Monopoly, Mass Effect Go Fish (I'm serious).Being an Early Access game, things are being changed all the time and there's bound to be issues, but even in its current state, it's certainly worth a buy.Is there anything I wish could be changed? Well, yeah, a couple.1. Custom model imports for game pieces.Earlier I mentioned Monopoly. Well, there's no house models, so you have to do like Chess pieces or something in their place. There's also no cats, shoes, cars, or anything. Just standard game pieces. I think adding custom models would make things very neat.2. Adjust the gravity a little for certain objects.I notice when I turn the gravity up, the game pieces move like I want, but then the dice is a little heavy. Maybe there can be sliders for dice, coins, game pieces, and whatever else.3. Tags or Descriptions for game rooms.Yeah, there's the name section, but people put their username or something silly there. Nobody puts what game it is. How about an extra section that lists the game from Workshop currently in use.Like: (Room name) (Host name) (Workshop item name)And if they're using a custom game, just let the user type in the game and that'll show.But even without these, this is simply pure raw fun.

I, however, am not one of those people, and think this simulator is absolutely great if you have friends to play it with.In TS you are given the freedom to play however you want to play. There are no rules in TS. You could even make your own game and it would not matter, because in TS there are no rules at all. Seven card stud? No problem. Your own twist on Monopoly? Go ahead.If you do not have anyone to play this game with, at the moment, I cannot reccomend it. You can join servers put up with the server browser, but these games are usually unorganized, and they do not have voice chat. If you want to get your money's worth for this game, get four of your friends together and have an awesome game of Cards Against Humanity or Poker.The Steam Workshop really adds a whole lot to this game. It insures that there will never be a lack of content, (as long as the community stays active.)At the end of the day, some will find it hard to justify spending money on something they could do to less of an extent (yet an awesome one at that) for free.

With some playful props thrown in and everyone chatting, It definately feels as close to sitting around a table as it can get without engaging webcams.There'sd no AI so rules are not artifically enforced, if a player wants to cheat by moving out of turn or swapping the places of a Knight and a Rook - just like in real life - there's nothing stopping them but honest.  However, there are physics mechanics in play to keep objects from slopping around the board.  Pieces can be hard- and soft-locked in place so accidental nudging doesn't ruin a carefully laid board and pieces can optionally snap to a grid.  -  Just enough framework to allow things to work well and avoid chaos without being restrictive and 'too much like a videogame'.I highly recommend TTS to anyone who enjoys any manner of tabletop games.

The tech support from the devs is timely and on point, the game interface works (though because of what it does it is a bit clunky, even with scripting), and the community is generally friendly. Yes, it's mostly secret hitler if you look for games, but there's usually at least something else going, or playing with friends works most of the time (there are a few bugs probably courtesy of the overburdened interface).Still reecommended, this is the only software on steam I have purchased at full price, and have no regrets about that (though the sales are plentiful, I was just between them when I got it)."

The developers are also very active and keep on adding features and fixing bugs. However I would point out some negatives:-The game has a form of DRM, even though the kickstarter campaign promised it to be DRM-free. Personally I would like to have a tool like this available forever to play with my friends, instead of depending on developer-run servers.-Since it is in constant evolution, updates to the game sometimes break or remove previous features that worked OK. The developers have stated that they do not plan to support older versions, and in fact do not offer them for download.-The game is advertised as cross-platform, but mac and linux versions have lower priority for bug fixing, from what I've seen.Even with these negatives, there are no alternatives to this game with the same functionality, so get it if you need it.I didn't mention VR because I don't own the hardware, but that is another point in favor of this game for some of you."

For those that hate the idea of getting your friends together in person (or just hate people in general), the company this game keeps is relatively small but kind. Occasionally you'll get the tard who excessively flips tables or moves♥♥♥♥♥♥around, but there are mods in place that frequently saves progress and kick features. There's even a main chat at the starting screen to encourage people to play together. In my first 90 minutes of gameplay, I think it's safe to say that I prefer the company of these strangers. The tablet and mp3 functions also allow for you to listen to stock music that you've heard a million times on top of full google access to a small screen that everyone sees in game. Tie that to the games soothing backgrounds, and you've got one of the most relaxing environments to simulate boardgames in. There's nothing like it.In short, the game's got two things going for it - a tremendous community of nice people and limitless game diversity. While you don't need it, you should get the DLCs that appeal to you only to show appreciation for the devs. I'd consider this a must-buy."

The Lua update has only made this even more apt. If there's a game you've ever played (or wanted to play), it's in here. The #1 board game product for people with a severe lack of IRL friends, or non-standard work schedules. The board game world is so much larger than Monopoly and Risk, and that's not even mentioning the rabbit hole that is Tabletop RPG's. A great way to make (and occasionally break) friendships. All the fun of table flipping with none of the mess. Digital setup and aids for games that are normally clunky irl and easy saves/loading for games you'd normally devote an entire day to, but can now play in 2 hour slices. No cats jumping on the table. Realistic dice that are fun to roll. Rapid prototyping for any board game you might have in your head. Cheap and easily accessible digital versions of a variety of party games, both official versions and unofficial. Runs smoothly on a potato, but can take advantage of powerful systems too (did I mention VR?). Play games with irl mates that have moved away, no longer does physical separation mean board game night (or RPG night) is over. And more.Buy it."

Board games are just easier to play in real life. The slow fiddly click-dragging of pieces (not to mention the occasional accidental/trolling table flip) make this a frustrating environment for casual board gaming with friends."
76561198029300088,Recommended,286160,30780702,Posted: 27 March,all,yenkin2001,"First and foremost this is a simulator of a table top, there is no AI, can you play solo yes and many of the board games allow for solo play especially co-op games.  In most cases you need to know the rules, the games often don't have rules with them. Most cases just go download a PDF of the rules, they are out there  on the internet somewhere, and in some cases the mod developers will put the link in the game.If you are expecting the game to do the work for you, not going to happen, you are in control, if you are lucky someone has scripted a few things but for the most part it is like walking up to the table, setting up the game to some degree and playing.  I love the coop games, and have played a couple that I own using this simulator and I am quite pleased with the way it works.  They are great for practice runs of games as you try to learn the rules.  So far I have tried Pandemic: Cthulhu version, Arkahm Horror the Card Game, One Deck Dungeon, and just set up Arkham Horror the Core game.IF you like the games, then you are encourage to go out and buy a physical copy of the game, in some cases not as easy as it sounds.  Final Fantasy, has a lot of games that are waiting to be shipped, reprinted and sadly in some cases are no longer in print.  But Board Game Geek market can be your friend.I do admit that I find the interface clunky at times, as you have to often bring up cards to see them (Easy using Alt).  But heck with my eye sight I have to bring cards up to read them anyway, so as stated you get a table top feel for the games.  Like in real life, things fall over,  you can even flip the who board if you want.  Thankfully it has a recall last using a back arrow, then it just sets up from the last position of the game.9/10 I think on this one.  Play Games here, buy games and support your local game store.  The interface also has built in hosting and I believe chat too.  So you can host a game with your friends."

The only limit is your imagination.There is an absolute minimum amount of hand holding.  If you play Battleship, you will have to vocally call out the attack, and respond with hit or miss.  You have to drag the little piece to the board to fill out the grid yourself.  If you play poker, you actually have to deal the cards and count the chips.  In Jumanji, you're responsible for releasing your own wild animals (0/10).  That's really my only gripe, some workshop maps offer some scripting, but I'd like to see a bit more hand holding (like an auto dealer for hold'em, a chip counter for gambling, persistent servers, some self moving pieces).You can cheat, you can flip the table, you can rage flick your buddies piece, and you can even play board games.

If you have a friend to play with then you have even greater of a reason to play this game! Man even I'll play this game with you if I'm not bust. Only thing that could make this game better is if they could get Fantasy Flight Games to sign an agreement to make expansion packs with their games. I heard they're working on Hasbro right now though. So one company at a time, eh? But back to this review. While I could ramble on forever, I'll try to close this up soon. So, yes get this game if you like board games at all because it captures the feeling. And if you're crafty enough you could play DnD in it now. It comes with some super detailed animated figures for RPG games! So if you and your friends bring thei rown character sheets and dungeon guide, I'm sure you could find a way to make it work!

It is a program that allows you to play pretty much any ""analogue"" game that you can think of, on the computer. While it will never replace the tactile feel that you get from holding actual game pieces or cards, nor the joy of sitting at a table with a bunch of other people who enjoy the game you are playing, it has so many benefits that any fan of any table top game needs to own this.First, you can theoretically play literally any tabletop game that exists in real life, on TTS. The mod community has shown a lot of hard work and creativity when it comes to available games on this. Aside from the standard games like Chess that already come with this game, you can play popular board games like the very popular, but much maligned Monopoly, to board game fan classic Battlestar Galactica. Even miniature games like Warhammer and Guild Ball are available to play. Want to play a LCG like Netrunner or Doomtown, but don’t want to shell out the hundreds of dollar’s worth of card expansions? It’s here too. If you have an idea for your own game, you can make it here too.The best part however, is it allows you to play these games at any time, even if your friends live far away, or if none of them are available. There is a community out there who wants to play these games. If you like table top games at all, and wish you could play them more often: get this game.9/10 “Excellent”"

It comes highly reccomended, but you must realize thtat right now it is still in Early Access and the game has many flaws.  Some of which right now include occasional hard lag spikes, limited boards, and RPG options. However, it has come very apparent that Berserk games is very hell bent on making this work, so I would not be scared of this turning into a no full release early access game like many in this genre.Tabletop Simulator is wonderful in so many ways.  If your like me, Board Games are super fun but harder to get people to come around a table just to play them.  Tabletop Simulator is full of people from all sorts of places ready to play a simple universal game like checkers and chess.  What I love the most is the RPG options, although limited, are still in the game.  I always wanted to DnD, so this makes it easier to get into it without having to buy a bunch of peices. They do plan on expanding these options as well as many more.Finally, the biggest apeal to Tabletop Simulator is the costumization features.  People are playing ONLINE games of Uno, Monoply, and the very popular Cards Against Humanity in mere seconds.  I have also found people making their own boards or making their own games with the features in the game and playing their own wacky crap online.Overall, Tabletop Simulator comes highly reccomended to anyone.

If many of your friends live quite a distance from you this is a very easy way to stay in touch and have fun at the same time!- Many people in the community make their own games, many tools are supported to be able to do this and almost nothing limits the creatiability.- The community is usually very friendly. Yes theres always that one guy who likes to come around all the time but it is mostly fine. People are almost always ok with teaching you new games and are ok with being patient as you learn the controls.Cons- The controls can be difficult to learn as a newer player, ive played for almost 1,400 hours at this point and i still do not know some of them to be honest.- Again as i said before i think there should be a better way to support the actual creators. There is some DLC that you can purchase for some games namely Cosmic Encounter which as far as i know does go back a little to the company.Overall i would reccomend this product though it can be a little annoying to newer players to get used to."

76561197990067766,Recommended,286160,30327196,Posted: 4 March,all,ajnaguy,"My review will concentrate on 3 areas:1) The simulator itself, and provided (free) and pay content - In a word, delightful. An easy interface, and the ability to connect and play with friends the world over is really cool. Great visuals, and of course the sandbox nature encourages a lot of DIY. For $20, it's hard to beat the value of this app, especially if you are a fan of games that require thought, strategy, and a human opponent to make them their most satisfying and entertaining.2) Out-of-print, rare, old games - The potential for bringing back many out-of-print, never-to-be reprinted games (old SPI, Avalon Hill, etc.) is pretty great, especially with the prices some people are asking for copies on eBay. I understand that someone, somewhere has the ""rights"" to these titles, but as long as they are not using them. I fully intend to try to digitize at least one of my favorites, or at least assist others in creating more content, particularly in the area of wargames.  VASSAL is also great for many of these, but take a hybrid card/counter/hex map/character sheet/encounter book game like the great WW2 infantry solitaire title, Ambush! - the VASSAL interface just isn't made for it. But I think TTS might just fit the bill.3) Existing, in print, readily available modern games. As many reviewers have stated, it's an uneasy feeling. As a musician, I've seen the changes in the recording industry over the past two decades, and how difficult i(nearly impossible) it is to make a living as a recording artist these days. For the consumer, it's the problem of too many great games, too little time and money. My hope is that publishers are looking at what's going on here and hoping that the chance to experience their products on TTS will drive physical sales, and I will admit - I've bought a ton of X-Wing stuff, although that was largely driven by the fact of playing on VASSAL (where you need the pilot cards, secondary weapon/mod cards, damage decks, etc.) in order to play. But as I learn to play on VASSAL and on TTS, it does increase my desire to play face-to-face with friends and family, and that has also contributed to my acquiring physical expansions. I also know that at the moment, I am concentrating much of my TTS time on X-Wing, even though I have subscribed to MANY other games.In closing, you should come play. It's a lot of fun!"

No problem: just jump on Tabletop Simulator, and play together on a virtual board with pieces, cards, and dice to move around. Not only are there several games that come standard with your purchase, but the community on Steam Workshop have crafted just about every game you can think of: I've even found a mod of Heroscape!It should be noted (upon reading some negative reviews) that this is a merely a physics-based sandbox: it will not carry out game-related actions for you, nor will you be able to play against AI opponents. Any physical action you would have to make in a real board game, you would have to make here. However, this actually works to the game's advantage: without the need to program game rules (though there are some mods that can perform various scripts), modding becomes much easier, and the number of games available becomes virtually limitless."

Right now the mechanics are very solid, my only gripe being the difficulty to sometimes select one out of a pile instead of picking up the entire pile. It is sometimes very difficult to get a bunch of friends to come all the way over to your house to play tabletop, but this game eliminates the problem. If you don't have friends interested in playing I would probably advise against buying it, it is a game that can sometimes work playing with strangers, but has a high grief potential and also minimises the fun if you aren't playing with people you know."

People have already dozens of custom games for TTS, and a lot of them that I've seen are really well made.

Much like taking a real game out of a box and putting it on the table, therules and play are totally up to you.The host has some control, but it's mostly in making sure the game gets set up.With built-in voice chat, this game is quite helpful for remote game nights with family members who are away and unable to play locally.

And that is saying something considering I barely play board games, but used this as a tool to learn a new one with friends across the country.Current VR support is mostly unusable, because the screens on the Vive are so resolution, it's near impossible to play any games you don't know by heart and it's very annoying to zoom in and out to read text. There should be ways to pin cameras around the board so you can reference rule books or played card areas quickly.For years, physical card games and video games have been seperated. Video game clones for card games almost always suck or are incredibly limited. Not so anymore. This lets you take having to store a ton of boxes and being present with multiple other people and makes everything super accessible!I love seeing brand new board games like Scythe embrace the concept of Table Simulator by offering their game for $8 here or something like $50 for the paper board game version."

I thought it was just another addition to the growing trend of ""simulator"" games (Goat simulator, grass simulator, I am Bread) that was more about the ridiculousness of concept than any actual gameplay mechanics.I was wrong.This is actually an incredibly well thought-out and functional game which is basically exactly what it claims to do: simulates a tabletop. Basically it's just a small sandbox that you can manipulate with your mouse and a variety of tools they provide you (flicking, creating lines, drawing on the table, and hidden areas being just a few) that let you pretend to the best of your ability that you're sitting around a table with your friends all playing a game of cards.With each update this game has added even more functionality and accessability, and I can honestly say that this is one of the few games I have bought in the last year or so that actually exceeded my expectations. It takes some getting used-to, but once you've got a grip on the controls then everything should come together naturally.I've personally used this to play checkers, poker, Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, Dominion, and Magic: The Gathering. My friends and I even recently started up a group to play Pathfinder, and are having a blast so far.Frankly, if you're a huge tabletop gamer but don't have the time to meet your friends regularly or are living far apart from your regular gaming pals (as is the situation with me) then this game will be perfect for you."

But then I'd just be sitting there alone, possibly for hours, waiting and hoping someone jumps in to play with me. There should be a central lobby for people to meet and say, ""I'd like to play Game X, does anyone else?"" Instead of hoping to find something in the server list, and possibly not finding anything.I still reccommed this game however.  Because when you DO find a game to play, it's a fun experience, and Voice chat helps a lot."

If this already exists within the game, please excuse me, but maybe the ability for player-made spreadsheets within the game's base UI.

,Recommended,286160,14940322,"Posted: 17 March, 2015",all,Keep,"First off, let me preface this by saying that this game has no AI.  There is no scripting that is done.  It's a simple sandbox that you can play tabletop games in.  Unlike some I knew that buying this.  Not sure how you could be misled, they state it pretty clear in the videos and online.Since that's over with now, let’s get to it.  As a sandbox, it's great!  The physics are there and adjustable (drop height, size of items and controls).Custom content, well there is a lot of it on the workshop.  Some legit, some not so legit.  Some publishers have been going around and serving pesky take down notices to some of the games that are out there.  But creating custom content is pretty easy, if you're adding cards.  I have been using this to playtest card games, so most of what I do is card based.  Making custom models and meeples or tokens is very difficult if you don't already have experience at 3d model and UVunrapping (not even sure if that's the correct word).  I tried for a day to make a custom hexagon card or tile for a game.  I finally had to end up just making it a square card and ignore the edges.They include a program now that will help with importing custom cards.  Also something to note is that all custom content has to be web accessible.  As in you must have the files uploaded to a web host or an image hosting service in order to load the custom content.  You can't just have the custom files on your hard drive.  It needs to be on the web so the other players can download the custom content.  Doesn't have to be on the marketplace, just on a webhost somewhere accessible.End of the day, if you love tabletop games or want to prototype a card game I would pick this one up.  Haven't used it for a RPG yet, but looking forward to doing it soon."

The worst bug you can expect is random crashes, but those are few and far between (in some cases it is the mod's fault and not the game's, such as having very large file sizes that wrecks your computer).All that being said, I highly recommend this game and would like to commend the developers for delivering a great product.

More of a ""toolbox"" or ""front end"" than a game itself it makes playing boardgames remotely, or even locally if you have enough computers, a breeze once you learn the few required hotkeys and turn on ""Semi-lock"" in the options (and make sure you always play with semi-lock on so you aren't scattering pieces everywhere).This weekend I played several games of Eldritch Horror (one of my favorites but just so time consuming on setup and take down) and Combat Commander: Europe with friends and the games went smoothly.  The only recurring issue we had was that if a player was on the wireless extension it would occasionally drop and you would have to wait for them to reconnect and reload the files.Other problems I seem to be seeing as well is that even though I tell the game to ""cache"" the mods it seems to pull down the assets from the web every time it loads making it take up to 2-3 minutes for LARGE games (read War of the Ring, or EH) to load in.  Aside from that though it functions exactly as advertised, I only wish there was a few more tutorials on creating new content as I have several games in my 300+ physical collection I would love to implement as I generally don't get them to the table that much due to setup time."

Now I live on the other side of the world in a country where almost no one speaks English. For a guy who loves tabletop games such as D&D, Settlers of Catan, and Magic: the Gathering (not a tabletop game, but stay with me on this), this game was a huge deal for me, because I can now play games with my friends. We currently have a weekly Cards Against Humanity game together, with awesome expansions including Game of Thrones and Sonic the Hedgehog (absolutely HILARIOUS).Pros:+ Very flexible UI and game physics. This was done on purpose so that you could basically upload any game onto the Steam Workshop and then play it.+ Several games are available before you even go to the Steam Workshop. From a handful of card games, to a couple of their own board games, to chess, to even a basic kit for RPG's, this game has all the resources you'll need to play any game you can think of.+ The devs work very hard at making sure you can post whatever content you want, copyrighted or otherwise. They believe in allowing players to have the freedom to play a game. There's a very big Warhammer and Star Wars: X-Wing community on Tabletop Sim (and you can imagine why. I'm not paying that much money for one army in a game I might play 3 times in my life). Whatever you upload to or download from the Steam Workshop should be considered lawyer-proof.+ The Steam Workshop allows you to have virtually unlimited access to any game or mod you want. There are so many resources for things to add to RPG's, board games, card game expansions--anything you can think of!Cons:- There are some bugs here and there regarding the game physics. There are constant updates, however, so this is a minor concern.- The user interface takes a little time to get used to. There are several videos online to help you out in this regard.- Handling objects in the game can be awkward at times, and objects don't always snap into place like you want. Setting up a game of Setters of Catan literally makes me want to perform Harikari. Thanks, Satan!- If you press me, I guess I would say that card games such as Magic: the Gathering can become tedious, especially if you didn't realize that you can set the snap rotation to 90 degrees until someone pointed it out in a video. Tapping cards is a real ♥♥♥♥♥ without proper snap rotation. But this con is me scraping the bottom of the barrel.In sum, the game itself is a really great resource for people who a.) don't have the physical resources to play a game such as miniatures, boards, or card sets; or b.) want to play with people who live far from home. For me, both apply, and that's why I'm giving this a huge thumbs up. This is an incredible resource, guys. If you're a tabletop gamer like I am, this is a must-have. It is worth the 20 bucks several times over.Total rating: 11/10"

Almost every feature you need is there. Need to deal a whole deck of cards to 5 people? Just right click and it will deal them equally to all players. That's just one example.4.)

Another possibility would be to have people gather round the monitor and play a game together in the same room when they don't own a copy of a game. I bet it would work wonderfully with the steam console hooked up to a TV.Going onto the steam workshop allows you to look for games that you can load into tabletop simulator. If you can't find what you're looking for, maybe you can find someone who uploads games. Or maybe you have a way to create the game and upload it to the workshop.It also has many old favorites like checkers, chess, connect 4, battleship, clue, monopoly, various card games, etc."

And even then, you can, as a host, easily make them ineffectual.B: Since the alpha and beta, steam workshop and custom games have been added, making the selection of games nigh-infinite.That said, my group of friends and I have played only a few games on here, but we LOVE it already. This should not be seen as a physics thing, or even a tabletop GAME simulator. It's a TABLETOP Simulator. The games have limited effects and rules glued to them by inept programmers. Instead, the modders give you the board, some basic figures and let YOU, the USER play the game.Which makes this absolutely brilliant.No more weird Monopoly rules, we play by house rules here damnit.A good example of this is the (now defunct, sadly, due to copyright issues) Munchkin game. A game where it's specifically allowed to cheat and play weird-as-hell cards that only have effects in context with others, programming this would be an absolute nightmare. No, this game gives you full and absolute control instead and you as the player have the power to play the game as you'd like, just like you would on a real table in real life.I don't know how the modding is, so I can't comment on how easy it is to make games. But judging by the amazing games already out there, it seems to be going rather well. This one purchase enabled me and my friends to have hours and hours and hours and, in the future, months of fun with tabletop RPGs, boardgames, pen and paper, dungeons and dragons and and and and.10/10 perfect."

It's a fantastically made game that not only comes with most common games, such as solitare, checkers, etc. but includes things such as tablets and calculators that can be used for games. Further, workshop support allows you to not only find other games, such as UNO, but to make your own game entirely, complete with custom textures, boards, backgrounds, etc.Now, what is probably the best part about TTS compared to other, actual simulators, is that the mechanics are well made. It's easy to use, and has intutive controls that can be brought up at the touch of a button for reference.If I have to pick one thing as a gripe, I'd say that the server browser does not show ping. It shows region, but not ping until you are in the game.In conclusion, this is a must have. Not just for board game enthusiasts, but for whole families, for when they cannot play a board or card game together, such as when in college, or someone's in the hospital, since it works on most modern laptops that have at least 4 GB RAM."

It does exactly what it says on the tin: provides a passable virtual tabletop for implementing board games.  There are myriad implemtations in the Workshop, and the game appears to be relatively straightforward to build your own in, which is great.While the interface is mostly intuitive, there is certainly some cantankerousness - even jankiness - in the physics, but absent being able to drag several meatbags around an actual table, this combined with your VoIP application of choice makes for a perfectly acceptable analog.More options for (as an example) zooming in and out while you are moving an object would be welcome.(I did not try the in-game VoIP, which is present)."

It was interesting but not really fun.Anyways, then for about a half of an hour I joined a server where nothing was planned. Just a bad idea really, I'd say don't do it.At this point, I was almost convienced that I wasn't going to like this, but then I saw a server in the chatroom that said they were looking for people for Munchkin. I joined the game, and after a few issues we were started. Our first game was good, but a little boring, kind of a warm up.Our 2nd game though, that was intersesting. We had the dungon of manditory murder up for a while, and the shadow nose came up, who has a 0 chance of running away from and makes you loose 3 levels. The player had help and they both were able to beat it. Then I threw in the gummy golem which is only efected by level. they were now at 7 to 15 with no chance for more help and no chance of escape.10/10 would stay at 1st level for most of the game again to screw people over.Anyways, my point is, this is kinda more fun to actually play the game with odd controls then to mess around with (so far. I only have 7 hours in this game. And juggling dice with R is fun.)"

I was extremely disappointed.   Now a few months later they have updated the game and the workshop is loaded with content.  It's almost what I want it to be.  And close enough to be useful most of the time.I have purchased a few DLC's and they seem to be quality with things organized fairly well for quick start.   Many very good imports on the Workshop that are either well setup or at least have the components that a little time and effort can get things to a place where you can save it and quickly start the game when you are ready.   Some of my favorite board games take a lot of time to setup and play and with this I can not only play with friends around the world but I can have the games setup before we play (saving lots of time) save the games when we are ready to take a break (giving the ability to play the longer games) and don't have to worry about losing pieces, bumping the board, and other crazy things.That said the system is based on a very elaborate physics engine and at times I wish you could just turn it off.  You pick up a card with pieces on it and they move a little (I can deal with that) then you try and put the card down and the pieces on it go flying (not so easy to deal with).  It can take a lot of time and effort to set up some games so pieces don't fly when they shouldn't.  If they can fix that issue this will be even better and easier to use.  But it's still very good and if you want a way to play board games online this is a very good way to do it.NOTE:  I have not see anyone use the lua scripting to automate the board games.  There are no rules checking scripts I have seen and the games you play here are not like playing a digital version of a board game.  This is a tabletop VR simulator.  You pick up the pieces and put them where you want just like in real life.  It's up to you and the people who are playing with you to stop cheating or breaking rules."

The controls for handling objects is pretty fluid, although not always intuitive. For instance, when wanting to move an object, it is not always clear where it will land. For the most part, it's where your cursor is. Depending on your camera angle, however, it can be different which sometimes make certain actions like moving a counter or something across a smaller game board. That is about the only downside that I have seen so far anyway, everything else is very well made! I would enjoy a dark UI option for those late-night game sessions but other than that this a solid game for ""enjoying"" a game a monopoly with your ""friends!""Also: Don't even sweat the DLC for this game, there are hundreds if not thousands of other games available on the steam workshop for free, and actually some of the ones that are DLC are there too.

I would have to say, for being a board game maniac myself, it's an amazing sandbox game, clearly one of my favorite sandbox games ever. It's slightly a bit hard to learn, but after, you can do anything, and I mean anything with Tabletop Simulator.You can create any board game you can think of, with pieces, boards, playing cards, dice, and even animated RPG figurines. But it gets better, you can import customized textures and even models to create board games even further. This game has WAAY too much customizable content, and that's what makes it one of the greatest Sandbox games there are. Definitely worth that $20, or less if it's on sale.Other things include online multiplayer with your peeps, so you can all mess around with game pieces, play the game right, or go nuts. As well as trading cards, achievements, VR support with HTC Vive, and not to mention the workshop. Oh yes. This review was pretty rushed, but I was just so excited about this game.

,Recommended,286160,13622234,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,Polysorbate,"Tabletop Simulator isn't really a game so much as it's... a tabletop simulator.  It has built-in systems for things like automatically stacking, flipping, and hiding cards, and requires players to manually move pieces/tokens/cards/etc rather than relying on a computer to do it ""properly"" as you'd expect in a purpose-built ""Risk"" game or ""Monopoly"" game for example.In this sense it's very much like playing around an physical table with other people; you must actually pay attention to what's going on and understand the rules rather than passively watch the game play itself.  This is both a good thing and a bad thing: on one hand, it makes the game feel much closer to actually playing a board game and it allows you to play by ""house rules"" rather than strictly by the official rulebook.  On the other hand, it necessitates a very complex control scheme which can be a bit overwhelming at first because there are so many different actions that might be needed:- Lift up one card- Lift up a stack of cards- Take one card out of your stock and flip it over- Place a token at a specific location on the board and rotate it properly- Fan out all your cards, flip them over as a group, and allow another player to take one- Move pieces around the board without them bumping into each other- Pick up, shake, and toss (multiple) dice with enough control to prevent them from bumping into anything- Precisely select one thing from among many that are close to each other or on top of each other- Take tokens off a card, flip the card over, and place them back on the card- Place cards in a grid without them getting jumbled together and rotated the wrong direction depending on who's placing the card- Move, rotate, and zoom your view of the game board for a better perspective (like how you might stand up or lean forward to look from another angle in real life)These are just a handful of the interactions that need to be intuitive and seamless, but all the developers have at their disposal is a mouse (2 axes of precise motion, 1 wheel, several buttons) and a keyboard (tons of buttons but they're all on/off, not ideally suited to precise movement).  Actions that would be very simple in real life can require memorization of a different keyboard and/or mouse combinations.  Some things even need to be controlled with buttons and sliders on the screen.  I'm very experienced with games that require a lot of different controls but even I took about 20 minutes or so to fully acclimate to Tabletop Simulator's control scheme.However, all of that said, once you understand the basics of how to control the game it's easy to switch from one game to another since they all use the same control scheme.  Also, many ""simple"" games like Chess or Hearts only require you to memorize a small subset of the full control scheme, so you can get used to things gradually.  Unfortunately I still think the controls will be a barrier to entry for many casual gamers to get into Tabletop Simulator, which is unfortunate since they're probably a big audience for playing tabletop games.Aside from the complex controls, another problem is that some game modules take rather long to load despite having (at times) poor texture quality, which can make small text very difficult to read.With all the negatives out of the way, I still think that Tabletop Simulator is a great idea and it has the potential to become a great product once it's finished.  It needs polish, and it needs more ""standard"" gameplay mechanics to be built-in, such as the ability to snap together hexagonal pieces to form a larger board for example.  Since it's still in development I think it's safe to say the developers are working on these sorts of issues and I eagerly anticipate seeing the finished product.If there was one single thing I'd ask the developers to work on with a high priority, it would be making it possible for cards to be divided into sections by designers, with each section able to be assigned a different texture so that design elements which are common to every card can be reused rather than each card needing to be separately loaded as its own entity.  Along with this they need to make it possible for text to be added to cards via an overlay rather than needing to be baked into the texture.  This would make it possible for text to be sharp and legible without the need for excessively high resolution textures.  This would greatly reduce the amount of texture data that needs to be loaded and greatly reduce system requirements at the same time - it shouldn't take my Haswell i7-based PC over a minute to load a board game.  If these features are already implemented, I haven't seen any Workshop games make use of them for some reason."

I usually play games that I actually own because I know the rules well enough.

A simulation of all kinds of table tops.I love board games and tabletop wargaming but sadly, the people I normally play with live all over the country and we only get to play games once or twice a year.But now, Tabletop Simulator lets us get together online, put on our headsets and boardgame or wargame to our hearts content.The program itself has some basic games and some more complex paid for ones, but it’s the modding community where the game really shines. Modders have faithfully digitally recreated hundreds of classic board games and wargames and has also allowed creative people to make their own games for people to play.The game can never replace the atmosphere of playing at a real table with your friends around you, hanging out, eating snacks and socialising. But it does have a couple of advantages. Thanks to it being in a digital world and the best modders using scripting, setup takes mere moments and if it’s getting late, simply save and load up later! No need to pack everything into its box (the point at which most people suddenly leave the room in real life).Something that does worry me is copyright. I’m not sure how it all works but I do worry that companies may take down some of the recreated games. This hasn’t happened however, despite the game being around for some time now.A lot of the games require a rulebook which is not provided (meaning one of you needs to actually own a real copy) but many games come complete with Pdf. style rules in the game. I’m slightly torn on this as I feel that having to buy one of the many games that companies have created in the real world is the right thing to do, as the creators put in a lot of creative effort to make them for us, but like every person I love a good freebie!Legalities of copyright aside Tabletop Simulator is a great program with many great games available.If you love playing board games then Tabletop is a must!"

You'll never guess what seemed to be causing the issue: Skype. Of all things, Skype on the other persons computer was causing issues with TTS. When they disabled it, the game worked proper (for the most part). I say for the most part because it wasn't complete smooth sailing but I can't blame the game for that :pI'm sorry for keeping this review poor because of something so unrelated to the game itself. I would urge you to put this new finding in any issues threads you have so people who face the same issues can try the same solution.Problem: games don't load/work when joining in multiplayer.Cause: Skype is onSolution: shut down Skype and use Steam, in-game or other voice communication solutions. For Skype, swap to web skype in browser in case you don't want to miss messages.I absolutely love this game and I'm REALLY glad it's working now.Again, appologies for not recommending it earlier for unfair reasons. I didn't know.Now then, off to recommend it to more people so we can play an 8 player round of Eldritch Horror :p============================Previous review:I've read great reviews for this game and the first few times I've played by myself things went pretty great. The application loaded proper and the content also loaded and worked proper. No complaints whatsoever, would recommend.And so I did, to several friends so we could play games together. I don't see much of a point in playing this on my own. They got their copies and the first round of a game I really like went perfect. Then the issues started and they've not gone away since:+ Content doesn't fully load in one go, even for the host+ Game freezes for other players+ Super high lag making the game unplayableStrange thing is is that the application seems to run proper for single player on all of their devices. It's multiplayer that so badly dies on them.Hence, I cannot recommend this game until the multiplayer issues have been fixed. If you find my review to not be fair or downvote the game due to easily solved issues, please let me know! I want to play and like this game. First round was great! I want to solve the issues and give this game a 10/10 but if I cannot play with others I cannot recommend this game."

An it is easy to play with other people on Steam with the general chat always willingly able ot lend a hand to those in need or even have this set up with a group of friends to play in person.All in all, I do recommend buying this for fans of Tabletop based games as some might not be financially capable of having these types of games for a hobby due to how expensive the sets cost *cough* *cough* Games Workshop, Kingdom Death: Monster Scalpers.So it's definitely worth the buy sale or no sale, highly recommend."

When college came around, however, we could no longer get together and play since I moved out of state. I didn't realize how much I missed board games until I picked up TTS during its last sale. I was originally skeptical about the game's ability to provide intuitive controls for manipulating various game pieces, but boy was I wrong. While TTS is primarily a physics sandbox and doesn't necessarily enforce game rules (it's up to the players to play a fair game), it does incorperate a whole lot of tools, resources, and code to allow games to be played just as they would in real life if not better. The ability to stack and shuffle card decks, hide your hand, flip individual pieces, etc. means that tasks that might ordinarily require a lot of fiddling and potentially make a mess become nothing more than a few simple hotkey-presses. I've yet to play any long-winded games like Eclipse (Maybe once finals are over XD), My experience with TTS thus far has shown that it is very easy to use and incredibly fun. I'd definitely recommend it to my old friends so we can play games together again.Pros:- Board games- Online multiplayer, for when you have no friends ;_;- Steam Workshop support- Can join any game and mods will auto-download and cache- Cosmic Encounter DLC (I have the physical game. It's fantastic)- Easily create quality custom contentCons:- Voice chat could use expansion (e.g. Indicator above player profile pic when chatting rather than in sidebar)- Playing in a virtual environment (esp. with strangers) can feel less socially satisfying- Morally questionable in regards to playing published games for free off the WorkshopFinally, it's important to note that the game is still being updated and improved, and the devs still have a lot to put into the game before they're finished. The list of future improvements and Kickstarter goals can be found on their site if you're still skeptical about the future of the game's development."

,Recommended,286160,27925542,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,Icebreed,"This part of the review addresses the original, mouse-and-keyboard method of play. I have also played it in VR; check further down for my thoughts on that experience.If you're a fan of board games, buying Tabletop Simulator is a something like buying 100 games for the price of one, plus your very own board game making kit. The engine's controls are, for the most part, smooth and easy to grasp. There are a lot of little tricks you learn how to do, as you play games with people, too. There are a multitude of games available both as paid DLC (which a host can play with friends without them needing to buy the DLC as well) and workshop mods, including some very popular mainstream board games. Many -- especially the DLCs -- are made with a surprising amount of polish and detail.Making a game yourself couldn't be easier. You can either use the many built-in tokens and boards, or take it a step further and supply pictures for your own board and cardboard cutout tokens, OR take it another step further and supply your own models and textures. You can even script things, now, to make them automated and/or interactive.Tabletop Simulator does have bugs, as any game is bound to when it is meant to be such an open-ended platform. They are minor enough that they can be easily overlooked. This game is the answer to the board game lover who doesn't have any local friends to play with. It's easily the best $20 I've ever spent.*** VR ***Note: As of this post, the VR experience is still in fairly early development. I feel this signficantly impacts how this part of the review came out.With regards to the VR experience, TTS is still an amazing piece of software. All of the original features are there, but the implementation is much more awkward than keyboard+mouse. Some of it may still need smoothing out from the devs. It is more noticeably buggy than the original, sometimes in ways that are pretty annoying. For instance, the game has the function to search through a card deck, but when you try to do this in VR, any cards you grab move in the opposite direction that you drag them, and if you try to drop them outside of the deck to move them elsewhere, it simply ignores you.Controller interactivity needs quite a bit of work, too. Currently, both controllers have the exact same functions for the trackpad, which is a waste when there are so many unassigned common functions of the engine that you have to go through menus to get to. It also enforces handedness; if you try to pick something up in the wrong hand, it puts it in the right hand instead, which can be strange. It makes you use that controller for everything, which makes me question if it's even worth it to use two controllers in the game. Throw and shuffle/randomize gesture physics are also needing work. Particularly stressful and complex mods are all but unplayable unless you have a beast of a machine; when the FPS dips, so does your head and controller tracking, which makes it all but impossible to point at and move things.All of those inconveniences and annoyances aside, you can still very easily play most TTS games from inside VR. Just be prepared to use your menu button for a lot of things. Locking and unlocking pieces seems impossible in VR, which can be crippling if you don't have another player to lock/unlock things for you. TTS VR is not the worst VR experience that I've seen, but if the experience is improved upon in the future, it could be one of the best."

,Recommended,286160,13190773,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,Kenny,"This is a fantastic game that you can virtually play any card game or board game with your friends. It is very well developed and it is quite stable despite being in deveopment stage.Now if you are wondering how it works, thats how it works for card games:You basically pick a colour on the table. You get cards. Cards can be dealed by someone or they can also be auto-dealed. There is an area in the table that belongs to you. When you put the cards there or around there, it is not visible to others but to you only. also no body can see a card if it is flip down. You can freely flip cards. put the cards in the middle etc. So it is quite simple to play.Here is a list of what you can do with the game:-Play the games that comes with the original game:-all card games that require a regular deck as you can get as many decks as you want,-many board games including chess, backgammon, checkers, chinese checkers...-all dice games, including FRP die-Play many FRP games, with additional help from DLCs you can even create character sheets easily or create your own maps and corridors...-FRP characters and creastures have nice animation and they can also move attack or die...-Play virtually any card, board, die, FRP game, thanks to the DLCs. (I have personally found a rare and wonderful game called Skipbo)-Customise the game table, background, etc.-Its also possible to play some games as hotseat but this needs improvements.Negative sides:-Customization of the game table and background are somewhat limited for basic users.-There is no AI, or computer players as it is against the nature of this simulation. So you cannot play a game that is normally multiplayer (like many card games) by yourself. Nevertheless, you can still play solitare games and any other games that you would play by yourself (perhaps chess, though I find it a little sad to play it alone)- In the multiplayer game rooms, if you host the game and if you have not made sure that  you locked some features and limited power with yourself and right people then some guys may come and flip your table, mess with your cards or mess with your game. Some strangers in multiplayer rooms act like a three years old babies. Nevertheless it is also possible to find some serious gamers as well.-Hotseat feature is not fully implemented. It is just a possibility I see."

There are functional ways to join other games, and the UI for it is smooth, and you don't need to do any port forwarding or anything of that sort, which is nice. And I was actually able to play a nice game of poker with a few strangers for like 40 minutes, and it wasn't an issue. That being said, however. It was significantly more fun when I was able to play Pokemon Master Trainer with a buddy (which was a Pokemon-themed board game that came out when I was like, ten years old, and admittedly the nostalgia probably added to the fun). In any event, if you have friends who also buy the game, you can play a darn near infinite amount of games on it. The workshop has a plethora of games already added, and you can create your own importing the graphics and setting things up.  Very much worth the money, and I like what they're trying to do. 10/10"

Very convienient way to play the games with friends that we never have the opportunity for. I mean when you and all you friends have life responsiblities just like everyone else to get to, it's not often you can get everyone into the same room to just sit down and play poker or a big board game. But suddenly you give everyone the ability to do all of these things freely from the comfort of their own house, either at the computer, or maybe sitting on the couch, controller in hand... suddenly things you couldn't quite gather the troops for are totally doable again. It's a nice feeling.As far as a game, I'd classify this much like Gmod; it's just a sandbox for the modding community to freely create models, games, and associated assets for. It's a generic physics engine with loose guidelines that you stick things into. And on those terms it's a great experience. The stock pieces and sound effects are nice, pretty, and satisfying to click, roll, flip, and toss. The tools you have to work with are generic enough to be multipurpose, but designed effectively enough to be practical.For $10 (the sale price at the time of writing) this is a very solid product that I'd recommend. At MSRP of $15, I'd still recommend it, even. With the promise of more features to come (devs if you're reading this I'm greatly anticipating some stock options and tools for CHARACTER SHEETS THAT WILL BE NICE) I'd say it's a steal even at full price, and at this point of 9 to 10 dollars we're seeing during sale, I've been handing it out like candy to my friend.Also the fact that they remembered to add an ""undo"" button to make use/abuse of the Table Flip button totally okay for most games is just the best.I strongly recommend!"

You pretty much have to play in moderation, as concepts and games will eventually get lackluster and boring in most peoples eyes. Play it every once in a while when you're bored for an hour or two and you'll get over your moneys worth.If you want to completely neglect the game you're playing you can summon in an Ipad, it's an Ipad but has the running speed of a 2014 computer and doesn't act wierd with certain♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's basically Google Chrome!Although multiplayer is consistent with children picking up the chess pieces, cards, etc and throwing them across the room, because they think they're funny! Although it does feel good and satisfying when you're not being a babysitting headache waiting to happen! It's usually one of the two extremes, nice people or kids who like ruining games.You can also import images into the game and use them as backgrounds or prints on the table you're using! You can also do a huge jigsaw puzzle I couldn't get to work.Although if you download a ""table"", ""background"" or ""piece/figure"" off the workshop, it's always going to be a map, meaning you can't combine cool tables with cool backgrounds, plus, they're not really backgrounds or tables, just normal maps with♥♥♥♥♥♥added on top of it, meaning that you are going to experience a huge ass♥♥♥♥ of lag. With props you can't load them with specific tables because they're always on the default ones, because you can't load custom workshop props into the game!Overall theres a lot you can do in the game, but it's very flawed in certain departments I'd reccomend it greatly, I beleive it is worth the price. I'd rate it a solid 8.5/10"

,Recommended,286160,26793318,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,fheer,"Tabletop Simulator is the debut title by developer Berserk Games, a small indie company composed of two developers previously known for their “Mana Warfare” mod for Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. After being greenlit on Steam and raising over $37,000 on Kickstarter, Tabletop Simulator appeared on Steam Early Access on April 18. The game finally released on June 5, 2015, but still receives frequent updates and DLC releases.The concept of Tabletop Simulator is simple – the game gives you a virtual tabletop and figures and allows you to manipulate them, giving you the ability to play all sorts of board games. The base game comes with classics such as chess and checkers, but the real meat of the game comes from the massive amount of user-generated content, such as board and card games, on the Steam Workshop. From Cards Against Humanity to Tabletop Mini-Golf, you will rarely find a game that the hardworking Tabletop Simulator community hasn’t ported to the game. The game features a very prominent multiplayer feature with up to eight players, including public and private servers. Although the community is very welcoming and you will rarely encounter trouble on a public server, the best way to play Tabletop Simulator is with a group of good friends.While the graphics of Tabletop Simulator are certainly nothing special, the game definitely looks realistic. All of the official models and textures are very high quality, and a surprising amount the Steam Workshop assets feature high quality models and textures as well. The game is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux with impressive optimization for each platform. Although performance is normally outstanding, with very consistent frame rates even on low-end hardware, the game sometimes lags or crashes when too many objects are on screen at the same time, which can be a hassle if it happens during a multiplayer session. The game may also be memory-heavy when playing games with large amounts of pieces, which can lead to the aforementioned performance issues.The gameplay in Tabletop Simulator is all based on the game’s impressive physics engine. Pieces collide and interact beautifully, with a variety of customizable physical properties such as gravity, weight, and material type. Players can utilize the game’s expansive toolset in order to hide cards in their hand, create secret areas that other players can’t see into, lock game pieces in place, resize cards or game pieces, and a large amount more. It certainly seems like the developers took every possibility into account when creating Tabletop Simulator – the game even has notecards that you can write on and a working tablet with access to the internet.As stated previously, the Steam Workshop features thousands of community-created games, which means you can play almost every board game you can think of. However, since all Steam Workshop content is created by the community, many of the games do include works that have been copyrighted. While most real-life board game companies don’t seem to care, there are some legal issues with certain Workshop board games, which may prevent you from playing the games you want.Anyone who is a fan of board games in real life should definitely give Tabletop Simulator a try. I especially like that it grants the ability to play board games, which normally require all players to be at the same location, over long distances. This makes it incredibly easy to organize board game nights with friends all over the world.At the end of the day, Tabletop Simulator grants a very expansive sandbox full of board games to the player. Steam Workshop support makes the fun never end by allowing players to access an arsenal of thousands of popular community-created board games. The graphics are great, but the physics engine can easily become overloaded wish can lead to frame drops. Regardless of any occasional performance errors, Tabletop Simulator is a great game that achieves what it set out to do. Berserk Games definitely hit the mark with Tabletop Simulator. 9/10"

In college, I learned to love board games and tabletop for the social interaction they bring. At the end of my education, I found myself craving a good board game way, way more than a multiplayer video game.You cannot imagine the depths I went to try and simulate the experience on a computer. I went to college out of state and made a lot of friends there, so at college I was missing my family, and at home I miss my friends. It's a Catch-22.I'd seen Tabletop Simulator before. I always thought it was excruciatingly limited to paid DLC modules. I never bothered to get it.Until one of my gaming buddies gave it to me as a gift.I found myself browsing the Steam Workshop soon after, thinking to myself, ""wow, look at all these games for free...this cannot possibly be how this game works.""I downloaded a Workshop copy of Arkham Horror.""...holy crap, it is.""""WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS?!""My cousin owned this game almost since it first came out. And he never once explained how it worked.Hence the assault charges.None of the above is true except for this: Tabletop Simulator is amazing. Tabletop gaming is making a resurgence and this is the surfboard that will ride the wave all the way to paradise.In less than a week of owning it I've downloaded around 25 board games I already own/have been meaning to play/never knew existed and have been rabidly playing all the games my fiance and I adore despite her being halfway across the nation. It is nothing short of a revolutionary piece of software that had my dad, who is NOT a gamer at all, in paroxysms of awe and wonder as he watched me explain its implications.If you have ever left a place that felt like home with friends that felt like family, get this game. It is extremely easy to use, provides endless possibilities, and is, in no uncertain terms, a piece of art I wish I'd had gracing my library for the last 5 years of my life.10/10, will be flipping tables for many, MANY hours to come."

Using their abillities to levitate these objects they began to almost seem joyful at first, but then it began to quickly change. One of the gods began to levitate a card, and just then one of the gods became infuriated, as one of the phallic objects flew for miles!

Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

The steam workshop support is also fantastic. This game has led to a group of my online friends holding weekly board game nights for around a year and a half now, something which I couldn't've imagined being feasible 5 years ago. Physical games are still nice when everyone's in the same city, but this serves as an excellent standin otherwise."

That's just the best way to play and really what it was meant for.-Controls:  They are very easy to learn and there really isn't anything out there that should scare anyone from playing this game.  I mean unless you are computer illiterate you will be fine.  I recommend doing their Two Minute tutorial it helps greatly.-Performance:  Well it can run off an Eggo so you shouldn't have any issues.  Yes you can import your own custom backgrounds / environments as well!-Content:  I was not sure on what there really was for content.  Let me try to summarize this lol...  you can play so many classic games such as Monopoly (countless special editions as well), Candy Land, Connect 4, Checkers, Chess, Uno, Shoots and Ladders, Life, Cards Against Humanity, D and D, Pokemon, Yugio, Sorry, ..there's just so many SO MANY games..    STEAM WORKSHOP if you don't know how to use it ...well it's simple so go check it out.-PREMIUM GAMES: They are a bit ""expensive"" but realistically NOT.   Most games in stores are $30+ and only ONE PERSON needs to buy the game for you to play it with friends.YES ONLY ONE PERSON HAS TO BUY THE GAME TO PLAY IT WITH FRIENDS.   That said only that person can see the rulebook as well so they will have to read or explain the rules to everyone.Countless fun and you can do local co-op wtih ease as well.  Now their name won't be in the game but you can just take turns on your PC.   Example... I'll play online with a few friends and if my Girlfriend wants to play.  She'll sit by me and play from my PC as well.I bought my copy when it was on sale.  I recieved 4 copies for $30...  That said even at $20.00 it is still a good deal for the moments you'll have with friends!   This is done much better than I originally thought!"

And it makes it easy to gather a bunch of people from anywhere in the world for a nice game of Cluedo. I'm very much in favour of this. I just wish there was more variety on the Steam workshop, because I can think of countless board games this could handle, but the fixation seems to be on those card games kids like these days. Alas! Alack! Alotta fun though, nontheless!It's cheap, cheerful, and it'll entertain you for a long time if you've a mind open enough for board games. Just grab it all ready!

As an advocate for The Sea, I would like to see more games involving The Sea, and for the developers of this, nigh blasphemous, virtual experience, to be sacrificed to the great God, Neptune.Only then will I stop writing unfunny paragraphs on an internet-based digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer, and social networking platform developed by Valve Corporation.I hate Scrabble, its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, random letters, ♥♥♥♥ it.10/10, worth paying £10 to constantly flip a virtual table, christ."

The controls are built for the mouse/keyboard, but the virtual hand is finicky and has a tendency to knock stuff about, making more complex games (like the tabletop RPG) more difficult to play as a result. However, with the workshop, it is easy to find dozens of different games to play, ranging from new, old, classic and infamous games. It takes little time to set up and is a lot of fun with friends, but poor controls make it a bit of a challenge to play some games. I'd reccomend it, but just take your time and remember, there's an undo button in case Jerry throws (his pawn/your pawn/the entire table) away."

If you don't like board games, well this could probably help you get into them! Card games are also included in this as well. It's not a joke simulator either.

You can create your own custom games as well and with workshop support the possibilities are endless. There's even online multiplayer, so you can play with their friends. As far as how resource intensive it is on the computer, I have a bit of a bad computer, but I can run this game very smoothly on ultra (Windows 7 32 bit, Nvidia GEforce 550, 4GB ram, 3.1 GHz processor, and not to mention a very slow read and write speed for the hard drive) and I have been able to spam objects onto the table quite a bit before lagging, though I have to run it on very high in order to play cards against humanity from the workshop. The game still looks great on the lower graphics settings as well. Since it's still early access, I imagine the optimization will only get better as well as all the features.There's also a short tutorial and you can hit the ? key on your keyboard to bring up controls.

To make it easier to move things around, a grid can also be set to any size to which peices will automatically snap. The notepad system can easily be used as a scoring system which everybody can see beside their screen.

And if you're gonna lose? Flip the table, now there is no proof you would have lost. Totally fun"

Many existing games are available on the Steam Workshop (although copyright claims often remove more well-known titles), but you can also import your own graphics, so if you want to play Obscure Game: The Rare Expansion, you can scan the bits in and play it in Tabletop Simulator with very little effort.The multiplayer works well, and has lots of neat features to help out with things like fog of war, picking up multiple objects, drawing diagrams, and writing notes.This game does not include pre-made rules for chess, or anything else of the sort. It's a game that simulates a tabletop, and the game bits you choose to put on that tabletop, with physics and some 'convenience' features. If you want a game that will handle rules automatically, you're missing the point and should look elsewhere.Incredibly well-supported by the developers, Tabletop Simulator seems to get an update every couple of weeks with great new features. It's very encouraging to see such active development."

If you love the idea of being able to play board games with friends that live nowhere near you then this game is most likely in your shopping cart."
,Recommended,286160,16314627,"Posted: 11 June, 2015",all,Junpei,"Tabletop Simulator is definitely worth the $20 just for Steam Workshop mods. This $20 purchase literally gives you access to tons of board/card games that would normally cost $50 a piece (which you should still buy if you love). On top of tons of licensed board games, you also have a few cool skin swaps (CS:GOopoly, Metal Gear Clue). The way you can actually put your own backgrounds/table images really enhances the mood per game you play. Even without Steam Workshop, you still get chess, checkers, plenty of tabletop assets for role-playing, and more!The main downside to Tabletop Simulator is its interface. Interacting with objects can often lead to frustrating situations. The in-game physics engine doesn't help either. Instead of a game of chess, sometimes it becomes a game of knocking pieces off a table only to realize you forgot to set the object interactions off. Stacking objects also seems to work when it wants to, and more often than not cards will go flying across the table as you attempt to stack them back into a deck. All of these problems increase tenfold when you are playing a game just find and someone enters the game who just wants to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with playing pieces and flip tables (these options can be set to off, thankfully, but it's still tedious). Far too many troll players enter games just to screw around instead of actually play.+ Great Workshop content!+ Surprisingly good value.+ Backgrounds look great, and the option to add custom ones is amazing!+ Tons of assets already come with the game, making setup extremely easy.+ Excellent graphics for the type of program this is.+ Customized table surfaces help when playing/teaching games.+ Creating/joining a server is as easy as can be.+ Plenty of server options to keep trolls from destroying a game (though they still can do some damage unless you lock out EVERYTHING)- Troll players who enter games just to screw around with pieces (not exactly the game game's fault, but it is part of the experience)- Physics system gets in the way of a ton of games, meaning actually playing them is a chore.- Clunky interface/controls that seems as if they could have been implemented better.Conclusion:Tabletop SImulator isn't to be missed. If you can get past a few of its frustrating bits, it's honestly one of the best ways to spend time with friends or complete strangers. Nothing like sitting down at a table and playing a good game of Risk, Monopoly, Formula D, or plenty of other games! If you're even the least bit interested in a board game, look and see if it's on the workshop and try it here before buying (but buy it if you enjoy it, board game devs go through a lot these days). All around one of the best purchases available on steam."

It is recommended to have a bunch of friends because it will make this game the best co-op experience.Anyway let's get down to the game. Rather than a game itself, think of it as a gateway to thousand of games. Spanning from simple board games like monopoly or poker to more complex ones like D&D and Warhammer. What makes this game more lively is the control you have over the table. You can move and interact with every piece of the game you have chosen and not only that but it gives you the freedom to do whatever you want with that. More like real life rather than a hold-your-hand experience.Be creative if you want: do you want to create a board game but you couldn't just find the objects for that? Don't worry. The game will give you more than enough things to make your ideas into a reality. -Beware, creative mind is a must for this-.Workshop: That is where you will find most of the games you want to play, be it old time classics or modern games.

,Recommended,286160,23822794,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,wolfie,"Tabletop Simulator is a game where you are on a tabletop, most people use it to play board games, this function is great as you can pick up your enemies pieces and throw  them out of the universe. You can also be a complete troll and throw the table to disrupt the whole game and make the host rewind. This is great and all but clearly the best feature is the virtual tablet. There is a tablet in the game which is fully functional and works great for porn, now you can share all of your porn tastes with your friends! The tablet can be quite buggy but if you stick to pictures then you basically have a multiplayer porn streaming game. Due to this I give the game 9/10, if the dev releases an update which fixes the tablet for compatibility with more sites then I will be able to bump my score up to 10."

I've been looking for ages for a game - ANY game that I could play through VR with my poor, Vive-less friends. This game delivered the heck out of that. The cross-platform possibilty is fantastic because it allows me to feel like I'm actually sitting at the table while playing with buddies.I think one of the things that I appreciate most is how this game was originally a non-VR game that has been out for a while. This allowed for the Steam workshop to grow huge and give the game ample amount of content compared to most games on the Vive right now.If you have a Vive, don't be afraid to buy this. The game feels like it was made with Vive in mind (aside from the terribly low res-backgrounds). There is immense satisfation to playing this game, and it's totally worth the cash.One thing I would want to see changed is some kind of alternate model for people who don't have a Vive. They can see me and my hands, but for them, all I see is an icon, and it shatters my immersion in the game. If the game could tell when a Vive player is in a server, and gave all non-vive users some kind of model to make their avatars look like other people with Vives, that would make the experience a lot more immersive and amazing."

In my experience I personally haven't seen anything quite like this game online. They give you a good selection of games, and they have some neat items like a functional iPad and MP4 player. Also the ability to make your own board games are a neat feature. The two main downsides are the community and the DLC. The DLC is a little bit too overpriced, and the addition of Steam Workshop support more or less makes these DLCs worthless, given there's so much extra things you can get off the Workshop. The community so far is horrid, with a few exceptions. Most of the time it's either games with a ban happy admin or people who are just screwing around. So if you have some friends to play the game with, then certainly get it. If not, then maybe just wait to get it on a sale."

Yes, there is DLC, but there is also Steam Workshop support, which is better than DLC (when it comes to this game). You can make games, you can play those games, you can script those games... etc. Not to mention what other people ALREADY made on the workshop. If a board game exists, it's on the workshop. Tabletop Simulator is just $20 for every board game in the world. ""But I can play all these games online for free!"" ... no you can't. Don't talk to me about that BS. Listen, this is actually MORE than just board games. It's a real table that simulates physics and you can make your own models or use other models. I'm barely scratching the surface. I made some good friends on this game. Definitely reccomended if you love board games or having a guy's night out without getting out of your chair."

There is a TON of worksshop games to look at using with this. Use it with a mic and play with you friends and it is just like sitting around a table throwing dice or playing cards. I'd like to see it grow more though. For instance the ability to edit documents in the game so you can play pen and paper RPGs is lacking. If they add that, D&D and other similiar RPGs will bring it more use.Also the game uses cloud/online ssources to create/share content which I worry about someone taking down a game and all of sudden I lose a great game. Wish it was more download style so I never lose it, but I'm sure there is reasons it is designed that way so its not a complaint.

However, once I got into it I quickly learned that you really aren't purchasing a game. You really are purchasing many, many, many table top games in one. The standard game comes with the standard tabletop games. Checkers, Chess, Poker, Solatair, ect...However, with steamworkshop included you can get games like Muchinkin, Bang!, Risk, and many more. Overall it is a well put together simulator. I wish more of my fiends played it. However, I have made friends already though the sim.Not to mention if you get put out with a game...Just flip the table and say F... It!!!"

For the $20 they ask... no, not really. If it goes on sale or if a few friends pitch in for the 4 pack then yes. Its a fun game and you get plenty of play out of it but just like all board games, this becomes kinda boring and if you are anything like me (Fairly low attention span) then you wont get much play unless playing with people you know.Hope this helped. Happy Gaming"

There is no more hurrying up to finish a game, just save it and play it later rather than leaving it out in your house with the risk of getting your board game damaged or pieces lost.The simulator has been getting better overtime, allowing for more complicated tabletop games to be played. Also more and more games are getting scripted, having things which originally had to be manually done, are now becoming automated. Tabletop simulator also has voice chat and is a great game to have a beer and relax. Now if that doesn’t interest you, know that you’re also able to create your own tabletop game.

However it appears that there is no AI at all in the games, so that even though it is advertised as having single player mode this is apparently limited to ""solitaire"" style games. The description does not make this clear. The only reason I have a few hours of play time is that I went through the tutorial and then spent some considerable time attempting to find a single player game which worked. For example, it has a chess game, I figured out how to move a piece, and then waited to see if the opponent responded. When nothing happened I looked at the help and menus to try to figure out how to get the imagined opponent to respond, obviously unsuccessfully. I repeated this with some of other built in games, e.g backgammon. I then entered the online chat where I confirmed that there is indeed no AI built in to the game. This could be made clearer in the game's description to avoid such confusion in the future."

One for myself and my core group of friends. We play DC Deck Builder games, Fluxx, Cards against Humanity and so forth the game list because of the community is vast and unending. Are only real gripe is what's up with the table sizes. Seriously needs another size up size wise. Might be in the game and I just don't know how to fix it yet that being said.The big thing here is we play a lot of tabletop games when we see each other as a group but since we all live in different places now. That and some of the games, heck most of the games you can play here are super freaking expensive. When you break down how much some of these games cost in real life and compare them to this. This game ends up actually saving you money in the long run. I really can’t recommend it enough. Only other gripe is the four pack can’t be bought as a gift thus I had to pay more to buy the extra copies I bought during the Winter sale for four other people (You can buy it one time, get three gift copies but once you own the game you can’t do it again), found that to be slightly odd.Otherwise couldn’t be happier about it.10/10Highly recommended, even at full price!"

The game comes with a variety of classic board games- Chess, checkers, backgammon, etc.- as well as a Jigsaw feature, a few card-based games [including a completely manual version of Solitaire] and a suite of pieces for D&D-style tabletop games. On top of that you have 8 officially-supported boardgames available as DLC, and a Workshop where the community have added and continue to add pretty much every tabletop game, boardgame, card game and dice game that has ever been created.So when you buy a copy of Tabletop Simulator, you are essentially getting free access to every and any game that doesn't need a computer... on you computer. Ever wanted to play a friendly, immersive game of Chess with one of your internet friends overseas without having to get out your chair? Ever wanted to lose ALL your internet friends by kicking their asses at Monopoly? Ever wanted to fip a table after an argument over the rules to UNO without the worries of cleaning up afterwards? Have you ever wanted to play Texas Hold'em, but felt that real poker sets had a distict lack of anime fanservice? Or maybe you just want to make new friends who are into Secret Hitler as much as you are? If you said yes to any of that, the this game is for you!Although I will say this- if you want this game, definitely wait for the sales. I mean you COULD pay £15 to get a copy for yourself and then pester your friends to buy the game, or you can wait for the sales and buy a 4-pack for £22.50 [ish] and just give your friends the other 3 copies. I'd also recommend looking over the Workshop before buying this game, just to double check they have the games you and/or your friends want to play. There's a 95% chance [give or take] that it's there, but y'know... piece of mind and stuff...Why are you still reading this? Go get this game already! Even when it's not on sale, £15 for every boardgame ever is a pretty sweet deal- considering most of them in real life cost £20 on average."

,Recommended,286160,35140172,Posted: 22 September,all,CorkyMacaroon,"Katanas deserve much better than that. Much, much better than that. I should know what I'm talking about. I myself commissioned a genuine katana in Japan for 2,400,000 Yen (that's about $20,000) and have been practicing with it for almost 2 years now. I can even cut slabs of solid steel with my katana.Japanese smiths spend years working on a single katana and fold it up to a million times to produce the finest blades known to mankind.Katanas are thrice as sharp as European swords and thrice as hard for that matter too. Anything a longsword can cut through, a katana can cut through better. I'm pretty sure a katana could easily bisect a knight wearing full plate with a simple vertical slash.Ever wonder why medieval Europe never bothered conquering Japan? That's right, they were too scared to fight the disciplined Samurai and their katanas of destruction. Even in World War II, American soldiers targeted the men with the katanas first because their killing power was feared and respected.So what am I saying? Katanas are simply the best sword that the world has ever seen. This is a fact and you can't deny it."

I have tried it for the PC, Oculus Rift, with a mouse and keyboard, gamepad, and touch controllers.The main feature I looked forward to was in needing less room compared to an actual board game to play and quicker setup and put away times;being able to save a long-play board game for later is also a good idea.The game is really supposed to shine with virtual reality. It is an extremely user-unfriendly program. In virtual reality the touch controller interaction with the game pieces is clunky and there is really no way to learn without the tutorial, which is not designed well and will stall because you can't figure out what it is getting at and there is no way of just skipping past it (worse when you have figured it out, but can't convince the tutorial of that).One of the more difficult things in the program is turning over a card from the top deck and I never have figured out how to turn a page on a rule-book, which was a great idea since virtual reality makes it difficult to use a non-virtual rule book.In virtual reality the program requires a free room to walk around in; a large room. If I had that much room to begin with, I wouldn't need this program. Steam programs in general don't work well with Oculus and this is another example. When loading a new game you will find yourself in the middle of the game board. Go the the reset room view option and it will still have you hovering over the board game and no way to turn the board or table to reach those far-away items. With a large room free of anything and probably at least 3 if not 4 sensors to allow that large of space, then this program might be usable if not practical.Unless this program is updated and redesigned (it does not look like it was professionally made) I would not buy it. And even then, it probably is only usable with the HTC."

Play any boardgame imaginable, you're not just confined to the 15 game modes the devs give you. With mods you can literally play any boardgame. The mods are pretty small in download size too, 5kb for a monopoly mod I found. This game is soon to have steam workshop too, so everything you could ever want to play will be in one central hub.This is of course a multiplayer game. You can seemlessly drop in and out of any of the listed servers, provided they arent locked with a password. If the host has a game loaded such as monopoly people can still join and play without having to download the mod. Hosting your own server is also very easy, theres no extra download for it, and you dont have to port forward or use hamachi. When hosting, you will run into people who will flip the table. Fortunately there is a back button to undo any mess a person may have made, and a kick/ban button to prevent any further mishap.If you want to be able to play any board/card/tabletop rpg game with anyone at any time, then Tabletop Simulator is definately for you."

76561197995868600,Not Recommended,286160,24732065,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,WA-Numenor,"Simple TL:DR VersionThink of Tabletop Simulator as a blank 8x11 piece of paper. You can do a infinite amount of things with it. Make a paper airplane (times all the possibilities of different paper airplanes). You can write or draw an infinite variation of things, etc... But at the end of the day would you pay $5 or $10 for a piece of paper (that ordinarily cost $0.02), when you wanted to buy a book with pre-written content, or a painting, etc... (for that same price)?Table top simulator essentially out of the box is nothing more than a item importer with drag and drop functionality. Just like a piece of paper, its is amazingly simple, but yet has the potential to do so many things. It is a framework for other games, but by itself it really doesn't do anything. So if your intent is to buy tabletop simulator and play functional scripted table top games, you're going to be severely disappointed. It has the potential of doing it, but it doesn't mean it does it by itself, nor does it mean its even an elegant means of doing it.Essentially the main thing you're paying for when you buy Tabletop Simulator is dedicated server, and software that has clumsy drag and dropping physics, and the ability to import custom models. That is really all you get from Tabletop Simulator out of the box.There are mods for Tabletop Simulator that allow you to import ""games"" into Tabletop Simulator. But what that really means 99% of the time is just custom models, such as the pieces, board, or cards. It doesn't actually add any functionality or mechanics to them.____________________I don't really know what to say about this game... because it fails horribly from a functionality stand point... but at the same time it lives up to its name...You see the game is called Tabletop Simulator... it allows you to simulate your favorite tabletop games... such as having the board, cards, pieces, etc... Which you can freely drag around, flip over, and rescale. But that is really all this game basically does... allows you to drag and drop custom models around. So it means that yeah you can play a lot of board / tabletop games (like chess or checkers) that you like in real life in which all you really do is drag and drop stuff.Here is where is where I find this game severely lacking... things like lets say trying to play poker. The game has a premade setup for poker... but the premade setup for poker doesn't do anything other than give you a deck of cards, and a couple of poker chips. None of the poker game mechanics are scripted into the game itself. Meaning the game doesn't detect how much you bet, or how many players you have, it doesn't have automated dealing, it doesn't do any of the actual poker mechanic stuff like detect what pairs you have or how strong your hand is.Same with chess. For instance if you load up the pre-made chess setup in the game... none of the rules of chess are programed into the game. It just loads up a chess board for you, and places all the pieces in the correct starting position. Meaning if you pick up your knight, you can drag and drop it anywhere you want without it following the rules of chess which dictates it should move in an L shape.So yes overall this game allows you to simulate tabletop games by letting you have certain cards, boards, pieces, but due to its limited functionality out of the box, it is very poor at actually simulating the game you are trying to play due to the lack of out of the box pre-scripted scenarios and interact able interfaces and just general overall functionality.Essentially this game is better described better as a drag and drop simulator where you can load custom models into and do some minor scripting rather than a functional automated digital tabletop game simulator.At the same time the game does have scripting support for modders... which means someone could potentially script the rules for all the endless potential games that Tabletop Simulator could support. But realistically very few people have the know how to actually make use of the scripting function, even fewer people have the will to do so, and even fewer have actually done so.So I can't recommend Tabletop Simulator because the game in reality it is just a clumsy drag and drop simulator. It doesn't have any out of the box game support that effectively allows the user to simulate or play actual tabletop games with other players... things like possibly gui textbox interfaces to make things like character sheets easily. Or anything to help the average user set to set up game rules, or preset of rules for things like chess, poker, black jack, monopoly, etc... without having advanced knowledge on how to script things.If the game was $5 then I would recommend it if you okay with a software where you mainly just clumsily just dragging and drop things. Though in my opinion it is definitely not worth the full $20 price tag, nor is it really worth the $10 (50% off pricetag) I paid when I bought on sale. Especially since I can probably find a flash games online for free that has better functionality for a lot of the basic tabletop games. Or just play online with other people for free through Microsoft Windows preinstalled Checkers, Chess, or play Facebook Poker, or Solitare.If the developers could add in for instance pre-scripted templates for things like character sheets for DnD (of at least easy to use text boxes like you can find in MS Word or Powerpoint), or pre-scripted behavior for things like chess pieces that you can assign to custom models, and flesh out their preset ""game"" (blackjack, poker, chess, etc) modes with actual scripted functionality, then I would recommend this game. Until then I really can't really recommend this game since it does a really poor job of simulating particular tabletop games. Tabletop Simulator can do a little bit of everything, but at the same time its sub par to every other specialized tabletop game program in terms of actual functionality and game play experience. Which just makes me wonder why I would recommend Tabletop Simulator over some other game or app that specializes in the tabletop game the other person is looking for."

With an amazing use of virtual physics to animate all imported counters. Unfortunately it is goes too far down the this path and this actually prevents good gameplay. It is a pain to program anything beyond basic counters and that limits the games that can be simulated. It also adds a ton of lag making movements difficult.There is already a very good and free boardgame simulator. With many more supported games. Vassal may be getting old now but it still much easier to set up and use. Despite having no modern graphics Vassal is still the better choice for boardgames. Whilst those looking for a RPG simulator will also find something better. FG is still the best and still mostly free to play with so many ultimate licence holders. There is Roll 20 as well which is growing. Both of these don't have the fancy 3d graphics but you can play games. Tabletop Simulator looks fancy but it just does not have many of the features required to play online games.The only hope for Tabletop Simulator is in the VR market place as a novility item. Worth looking at but only when the price is heavily discounted.

I bought this to play a couple board games and a handful of card games (to avoid the rediculous cost of them) but the entire lack of scripting in 99% of the games as well as multiple versions of the same games through Workshop, many being sub-par, along with them being this overly time consuming and a pain to set up even if you know ALL the rules of the game you want to play.

All the fun of sitting around a table with your friends, now supporting friends who you are thousands of miles away from. Awesome.But:- The UI is clunky. Most importantly to me, this is the ""panning and zooming"" aspect of camera controls. If you have an angle from which you can see absolutely everything, it's fine. But usually you need to constantly zoom into different parts of the board to see what's going on properly. You can ""save"" camera angles, which makes this less of an issue for certain games, but most games you just cannot pick a couple of angles which will be relevant all the time.- It crashes constantly. As in, just closes, straight back to desktop, without an error message (and without any error log that I can find). I have been told that in other people's experience, crashes are most commonly related to ""out of memory"" errors. I expect that can't be the issue here unless TTS is keeping things in memory that it really shouldn't.- There is no way to ""pre-load"" assets. Card faces are loaded as needed, which brings the entire game to a grinding ""did my PC just lock up completely?"" halt while it does such intensive tasks as ""downloading a file"" (Is it single-threaded, perhaps?)- I would not base my review on this alone, because I'm honestly not sure, but: 90% of the Steam Workshop content appears to be no-way-in-hell-was-this-authorised board game rips"

,Not Recommended,286160,18297944,"Posted: 2 October, 2015",all,elaxter,"AT A GLANCEI can't recommend this sim for anyone unless you fit the niche required to enjoy it.WHAT IS IT?Table Top Simulator is exactly what it sounds like: a simulator of the table. The basic purchase consists of basic game tools such as a 52-deck of cards, chess board and pieces, and majong pieces.This sounds cool in theory, but once you start playing you find that it's more a gimmick than a simulator.WHY?This game is a hassle to use. Loading it up and going through the tutorial gives hopes that the experience will be grand. ""Such possibilities,"" one might think, ""I can play an unlimited amount of table top games with this!"" This is where the game falls short.First, the controls. You control the world with a combination of the mouse and keyboard. You can grab objects and move them around with realtime physics. This sounds awesome, but in practice this is a hassle to move objects around. Because the engine is physics based, all objects need to have physical representation. You can't virtually roll dice without a die being present on the board. To roll said die you have to pick it up, shake it, and drop it, (or right click and click ""roll"") which is a hassle. Playing cards is extremely difficult due to the nature of the physics and stacking, and requires fine control if you want things to go as smooth as possible. Playing a game like Rummy, where all the cards in the discard pile must be seen, takes skill to even begin to play your cards. There are many other issues that exsist, but I must move on.Second, the content. The game starts you with almost nothing in the way of games. No one wants to play blackjack or chess because you can play those games far easier and for free in other places; therefore, you have to either make your own, unique game, or know of a ""non-classic"" table game. (Monopoly, Risk, Cards Against Humanity, Dungeons and Dragons) This requires one of two things: 1) The materials located on the workshop or available as DLC or 2) the ability to model/texture/code objects into the game. The latter is surprisingly easy to impliment if you have the ability to do any of the aforementioned tasks, but seeing as an in-house modeling system is nonexistant in the simulator, you have to rely on out-of-house modeling programs. This is the fence that one is on with this simulator. Either the materials needed to play a game exist as DLC or are found on the workshop, or you have to make them yourself. This is tedious, as you require skill in art to reap the real benefits of this simulator. And since no simplified modeling system exists, it shuts off those without artistic ability from having the real content. You are stuck with other people's items, and if the items for your prefered table game do not exist for download or DLC, you're out of luck.Third, the multiplayer experience is non-existant. This is understandable for this type of simulator, but this simulators ""PUG"" experience is just not there. You have to have a combination of friendship and luck in order to get any enjoyment out of this sim, due to the nature of it. Singleplayer does not exist. Similar to other sandbox games such as Garry's Mod, you have to make your own fun. Only after having a second person (or more!) to play with does this game shine. But forget dropping into a room randomly. The players in there are nonresponsive or unfriendly and either don't know the rules of a game or know the rules too well. Many a times have I tried to host a card game server only to be met with people who had no idea what they were getting into. Many ""I don't know any card games"" and vows of silence.Finally, free alternatives exist. Roll20, a free table top RPG simulator, is free and far more flexible than Table Top Sim. Not only does it stay in 2-Dimentions, (which makes adding content easier) it also features voice and video chat, multiple pages for maps and encounters, virtual dice that don't need to be on the table to use, drag-and-drop support for images so adding maps and tokens is a breeze, a collection of pre-made sprites for use when you have nothing to use, soundcloud support so you can play songs for everyone to hear. All for free, plus an optional membership that can include coding support and vision cones for players. It's far better than Table Top Simulator.FINAL WORDTable Top Simulator is a gimmick, nothing more or less."

Unless you bought it to play Solitaire for hours on end by yourself in which case you're golden.Update: My review stands, although the multiplayer now works mostly (mostly) it's a bodged-fix rather than a solution. The App is about to be released properly and taken out of Alpha yet on Mac pretty much every mod on the workshop that I've tried crashes it due to memory issues and un-optimised code. (Quad core iMac 16GB should be plenty). I've put many hours into trying to like this, but it's just buggy, lazy, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and sloppy."

Games were created in the simulator such as solitaire, chess, checkers, etc. You can play the created games but with many limitations. Here is a list of pros and cons as to why I do not recommend it.1. Simulating Board Gamesa. One is able to create board games and play them. An example is the game of LIFE is available in the subscription      section.b. The rules of the games are not there. An example is the game of LIFE, Monopoly, Chess etc. can be played anyway you want. This is a double edge sword because people can play out of turn, flip the table, screw with pieces, and mess things up really easily. Some people would disagree because the host can lock specific pieces of the board down which brings me to the next part of the issue, controls.2. Controlsa. The controls of this game are way too complex for a person who is not adept at computers or does not have strong hand eye coordination.  In simple terms if you expect to just use your mouse to control the entire game, forget it. You have to use a multitude of keyboard inputs, mouse, moving the camera etc.b. The host of the game may be able to lock pieces down, but the tasks of hosting them game become way too complex to really get into the game and enjoy it for what it is.3. Multiplayer/Sociala. This is one of the few simulators that allow multiplayer interactions through LAN or Internet. If you have friends/family you want to play with it might work. The catch is if your friends or family has patience and is very adept at complex controls.b. Online community is a mixed bag of serious people, trolls, and griefers.4. Graphicsa. The graphics is very nice.Overall, the idea is great but the execution is clunky and poor. The main downside is the controls because if you want to play with a friend who is not so adept at computers, it will not happen. Playing Candyland with a kid who is not adept with hand eye coordination or knows complex contorls, he/she will just get frustrated. The simulator has great potential only if the controls were well defined and simplified for all crowds."

Unfortunately, it is not supported. I have been in support with BerserkGames for several weeks and I am not sure that they are working to fix it. They give suggestions like ""Verify the game integrity"" or try port forwarding, both of which do nothing to resolve the issue. Other players have experienced the same issues as can be seen in the Steam Discussions for this game and in the Berserk Forums. Bottom line, do not expect support from these people. They don't seem to care.On to the game, the game itself is alright if not a little incomplete and old feeling. The community is really wild. Sometimes you will find decent people to play with, but random encounters will place you with trolls most of the time. I have also ecountered rage players who get all bent out of shape just because you are trying to read the rules before the game starts, and players who decide to play the game for you, moving your pieces, taking your cards, and rolling the die on your turn. So while I would just say buy this game to play with your friends, I can't since the game is broken for LAN.So here's my advice: don't buy this game. It's broken. Early access is no excuse for a non-working product. What little of it that works is ruined by a terrible community. Avoid buying this game and instead opt for a game that has multiplayer built in and working smoothly, or just buy board games/card games in real life and play those. Avoid Tabletop Simulator."

Sure, the idea of playing board games worth £100s was too tantalizing to pass up. But what they don't tell you is that the usability is so horrid it makes the experience of playing a board game three times as hard as it normally is - the exact opposite of what you'd expect from a computer game.If you're thinking of buying this game, it is probably worth checking out a youtube video or two to see how it all works. Consider that in your typical board game you will need to read the rules, set up the components, deal cards, chuck dice, etc. When playing a well-designed board game app, however, all this fiddleness is removed - you might simply click on a button to simulate a die roll or click on a deck to receive your card. It usually cuts the play time down to less than half. Pretty neat, right?But TTS does the exact opposite of the above. No game is already set out neatly for you. There are no rules to let you know how to play a particular game you've never tried before. Each card has to picked up by 'hand' (dragging the mouse), and each die the same. While some veterans users may argue that it allows you to do so much more, such as gripping or dealing multiple items at once, the point here is that it's awkward and clunky to deal cards or chuck dice this way, whereas if you were sat at a table you'd just grab the stuff with an effortless motion. Anyway, this is just my 2 cents to make buyers more wary of what they're actually getting before they purchase.TL; DR = It's MUCH easier to play an actual board game than it will ever be to use this."

And no, I'm not referring to the fact that it was laggy as hell- that's probably because my computer is a potato. My big objection is the basic user interface. I only tried for about an hour before I gave up, and that was an attempt at a Pathfinder game, so my experience is obviosly limited, but the whole UI just seemed awful. For example, the character sheets. In order to enter your class, you don't simply click on a dropdown box and choose the class, nor do you click on a space and type the class name. You first have to actually zoom in and maneuver the screen until you can look at the ""character sheet"" on the screen, and scroll around until  you find the ""Class Level"" line. Then you click edit above that. Then, a little coin appears on the screen, and you right click on the coin. Then you find the space that says ""Class level"" and type in your class name and level- ""Alchemist 1,"" for example- and then you have to click edit again to close that. Then you move on to ""Race,"" and all the other options... There was, so far as I could determine, no way to get a simple, virtual character sheet such as I can get for free on half a dozen websites. It seems like it's so dedicated to creating an illusion that you're actually at a table (an illusion which it fails miserably to create, I might add), that it fails to provide a more user friendly interface, or even the *option* for a user friendly interface.The one positive aspect I did see- the recruiting community was *very* active. If you can stand to deal with this program (and it very well may be better, in games other than Pathfinder), then you're sure to find a game to join."

,Not Recommended,286160,32078690,Posted: 30 May,all,Dr. Inconspicuous,"tl;dr - simulation, does not feel like real thing.I think it is a nice game that does make a valiant effort to simulate board games to the best of it's ability. However, I think that tabletop simulator is definitely still not perfect, as I would rather play with a real chess set or a real checker set than the ones in Tabletop simulator. I also never have approved of paid DLC on a paid game. I always think to myself, ""why not just ask for more up front with the dlc included?"" If you are already going to spend money on a game, why spend more for one more board game? 20 dollars for a game, then at least 5 dollars for another game when the workshop is already filled with games anyway (which I also want to talk about). At least it is not nearly as bad as some games, with one-time use items for real money on an already paid game (luckely not Tabletop Simulator). You are probably getting tired of reading this paragraph and disoriented so I will start a new one.With no offense to creators, I do think that there may be many violations in this game. Again, with no offence, a downloadable monopoly game for free (not including 20 dollars upfront to a different company) takes money away from hasbro, the legal owner of the trademark. Again, with no offence or disrespect. This a review, darnit.And that's about all my complaints. So, all in all, 4/10."

It has vr compatibility which is a great feature that I sadly don't have the privilege to use.  I have invested about 9 hours in this game where 2 hours was spent trouble shooting my connection problems, at the end I figured that the only solution is to spam the connect button and pray you don't time out or the host decides to reset anything.Despite the connection issues I encountered I also ran into a problem where it would not allow me to host my own server but after spamming the button a few times it eventually allowed me to create a lobby.Where this game shines is in multiplayer, Tabletop simulator gives players a diverse arsenal of tools and ways to interact with objects on the board, this allows for some unforgettable moments and great laughs.Luckily if you don't have friends and you are willing to endure some spam you can browser servers and see what games are being played, how many players are currently playing in that lobby and whether or not the room is password protected, but the server browser is also not perfect because every time I use the filter option it seems to have no effect on the results given to me.so to summarizePros- Allows for very interactive gameplay- Great with friends- Huge selection of board games on the workshop- Host tools to change permission are plentiful and useful but not to a point where it becomes annoyingCons- Server browser filter seems to work some times- Players often crash when the game is reset- Controls are hard to get use too*Note : I have had more connection problems than I would find acceptable endure, I am not listing this because of my internet but it is something to take into consideration"

This is basically a board game framework. Most of the games you get are just the pieces, like in real life, you still need to learn rules and setup and play game. This is not like getting Ticket to Ride on steam where it handles the entire gameplay for you, you just are making decisions on what to do. That being said, if you do the tutorial, there's tons of fun to be had! There's some decent paid DLC, and tons of great workshop content. My choices for good DLC would be Scythe, Vitaculture, Zombicide, and Cosmic Encounter. For workshop, sky is the limit! I've seen Risk Legacy, Battlestar Galactica, Pandemic and Pandemic Legacy, Settlers of Catan, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Dominion, Dead of Winter, Agricola, Caverna, Carcassonne, Mansions of Madness (haven't tried this but it would probably work great with the helper app), tons of D&D type games, and fan projects like Fallout Risk, etc. I especially like the ones that have scripts in them to help play, for instance the Forbidden Island with scripts to properly do the flood deck when you draw and shuffle. System requirements are very low, and probably would work on most low end laptops with intel integrated chips too. Voice chat is highly recommended, or even skype if you know the person. If you don't know if this is for you, check out the videos or youtube. For me, it's tons of fun and yesterday I got to play a round of Pandemic Legacy with a good friend who lives on the other side of the country that I don't get to see often enough."

,Recommended,286160,15681454,"Posted: 4 May, 2015",all,Casia Games,"OverviewComing back to this after it's full release after coming out of early access I will say that I see this in a completely new light. Tabletop Simulator, unlike other ""Simulator"" titles, is actually a simulator, you get a table and an infinite number of pieces, or at least as many as your computer can handle. The workshop support is fantastic and the amount of games on the workshop alone is enough to justify the price.For PlayersTabletop simulator really is what is says on the tin, it comes with plenty of board games and the option to create your own monstrosity out of the library of both provided pieces and workshop pieces. You do have to have an appreciation for tabletop games but for the base price what you get is more than enough. The DLC games are very high quality and all assets are provided by the game developers themselves if you find one you enjoy don't be afraid to drop a few dollars on it.For Game DevelopersHonestly, for those thinking about board game development or tabletop development this is one of the best tools I could recommend, for the cost of the software you have a way to infinitely create and iterate anything you desire. It's beyond simple to prototype anything you can think of, rpg, board game, card game, etc. Beyond the cost of the software there's no further cost in printing up boards, decks, or buying pieces to prototype your vision with. The support for 3d models, textures, normal maps etc. allows you to set your creations apart from the rest if you're so inclined. If you have a concept in mind Tabletop Simulator can be used to create it within a few hours. The creation tools in my mind come highly recommended.ConclusionI find this title to be good in two aspects, the game play and the game creation. I find more enjoyment with the game creation aspect, spending hours upon hours just creating whatever your heart desires is amazing to me. I would absolutely recommend this if you enjoy tabletop games or are planning on making a tabletop game. It isn't perfect though, the controls can be a little arcane while using keyboard and mouse and sometimes the Vive controls are a little more intuitive, but that's my only problem really, and it just takes some getting used to.Overall: 8.5/10"

76561198045444719,Recommended,286160,30329883,Posted: 4 March,all,ZedDreppelin,"A nice idea, but like all platforms intended to bring people together to play games, it only works in theory but in reality this is best used by players who already know each and have spent time together playing other games. In other words, if you're expecting to just sit in and join any game, you are sadly mistaken.  Nearly every server for games like Cards Against Humanity, Uno, Clue, Funemployed, Superfight, etc. were private.  No outsiders welcome.  Tabletop Simulator is, in a way, an exclusive club with many rooms and you are prohibited from entering any one of them.  However, when hosting a game, there is nothing in the rules stating you MUST allow anyone to participate in your game.  It does serve a purpose of providing a safe haven for you and your friends to gather and have some fun; but, as I've mentioned before, you will encounter closed private games most of the time.  Yes, you can play single-player, and yes, you can host your own games, but if you don't want to take on the responsibility of being a monitor, what choice do you have?  None, really.  So, if you are part of a group, or have friends who would like to play games together, this is for you.  If not, then I'm afraid your SOL."

,Recommended,286160,32100036,Posted: 31 May,all,Apexecutioner,"I absolutely LOVE this game! Tabletop Simulator has great rendering, fantastic physics, and I found the controls to be pretty intuitive. The ""bread and butter"" of Tabletop Simulator, of course, is a combination of the Steam Workshop, and the ability to make your own games. With the Steam Workshop, people can easily make mods for all kinds of games - Monopoly, Splendor, D&D, Magic, Pokemon, Munchkin, Catan, and Dominion to name just a few. With just a few clicks, you can load up a game of Monopoly in a number of seconds and play in a virtual environment.I also adore the ability to design your own games. Once you get the hang of things, importing your own cards is easy and fun to do. I find Tabletop Simulator to be a perfect resource for playtesting my tabletop games without having to spend money on Game Crafter on physical cards and pieces. So if you're a game designer like me, this game can actually save you lots of money in playtesting! Yes, it's not the same as holding physical cards and playing with actual pieces, but it's a potential money-saver, so it's a give-and-take.I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys playing tabletop games, anything from Cards Against Humanity to Agricola and everything in between.

Basically an emulator for all things board game.My friends and I entertained ourselves for a good amount of time on pathfinder and dawn of war campaigns, which could never have been done in person because we were all the way across the country.Also very forgiving of bad internet connections, if one of your friends lags so hopelessly that you can't even connect on any other franchise. This game will still penalize you for having such connections, but the worst of it is occasionally lagging out and having a difficult time loading in the game pieces.A warning though is how different models don't behave well on certain computers for some reason. They will either spawn as little specks or won't load in at all. Redownloading or reinstalling the game helps rectify this problem, but that's why I said it needs work.It's a good buy if you're a dedicated gamer, but don't rely on the multiplayer fanbase.

Even if that's not your thing you can play pretty much any board game you can think of from chess to eels and escalators. If you want to play board games online there is nothing that compares to this game.

Now you remember that all your friends live half way across the country. That used to be a problem, but now you bought the table top simulater 4-pack and you shared it with said friends."
,Recommended,286160,34920700,Posted: 13 September,all,Danarchy,"The value that this game provides is incredible. The ability to play any tabletop game is really insane. If you do not have any friends to play this game with, I would not reccomend it since most games are multiplayer. This can be worked around however if you do not mind playing some board games with random people on the internet."

Unlike other games which only offer one thing, this one offers what is essentially an infinite sandbox mode with the ability to create and/or play any game to your heart's desire.Despite this, there are two things holding it back and making it not worth buying. The community is in a weird state in which few people are actively on (I only really saw about 15 games going on at once) and the ones on being quite toxic (they will literally ban you from their games if you don't cater to their specific ""needs""). With this, you'll often be struggling to actively play games despite tts' main ""niche"" being that.Ultimately, it's really hard to find a reason to get this game unless you have a specific group of buddies to play it with. Until the community changes and is willing to be less obnoxious, the playerbase is just going to continue to die off."

Whats better, its online so that ypu can play with friends. Makes games like D&D, Risk, and other board games so much easier to do. The only thing I'd complain about is very minor. The controlling of cards and items is not easy but the devs worked hard to make it as workable as possible. I highly recommend if you plan to play long crazy games with people who dont live near you or live busy lives."

,Recommended,286160,35493163,Posted: 5 October,all,Dumbdave7,"Theres very little to say about this game. It's designed as a simulator for games played at a traditional tabletop. It's well done with controls that are a little difficult but not overly complicated. While i reccomend this game you will need a few things to make it truely worth it:1) you need to have other friends that own this game. While community servers can be fun in thier own right, if you want to truely enjoy the game. You'll need a bunch of your friends to play with you.2) you'll need to use the community workshop. While you have a small selection of games in the default package, the majority of what makes this game shine are the community submissions. If you know a board game, it's likely someone has made a mod for it. If you've seen it on Geek and Sundry's Tabletop, Its probably got a mod for it or will have one soon.3) you'll want to turn off the music when you start the game. I mean seriously, that music is worse than an elevator. Turn that stuff off.finally looking at some of the other reviews i've noticed some people are having connection problems and lag making the game unplayable. While i've not experience this issue be sure to test the connection within the first few hours to ensure you can get a steam refund if you do experience this problem."
