,Recommended,286240,13288379,"Posted: 8 December, 2014",all,"Ryan ""50"" Quid","------------------------------FIRST IMPRESSION------------------------------This game caught my eye and I decided to buy it on the first day despite no reviews being available. I will say that my first impression ispositive. I did not notice any obvious bugs or flaws. The gameplay struck me as repetitive, but not boring. It has the potential to be addictive. The game proved to be a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend a night. It does not seem overpriced, but remember to be wary ofanyearly-access title.------------------------------CORE GAMEPLAY------------------------------The core gameplay focuses on learning how to properly manage a team of dogs, and how to maximize race efficiency. Races use simple click and timing mechanics to manage factors such as sled position, hunger, jumping, and untangling. Proper racing is rewarded with speed and happy dogs. Awesome moments are rewarded with fame that can lead to sponsorship upgrades.Learning about each individual dog is important to team management. Each dog has a unique personality that will affect their natural sled position, likes, dislikes, happiness, and rapport with teammates. Dogs will have their own favorite things, skills, and faults. They will also have different levels of athleticism that will affect their fatigue and hunger.All of the information about races and dogs will serve one purpose: managing the team. The overall goal is to earn money from victories and move on to more advanced leagues. The time outside of races is used to rest dogs to lower fatigue, fill the journal, change leagues, and hire new dogs. Raleigh will offer a piece of advice (chosen by you) at the end of each race. This information will be used to fill the journal and provide gameplay tips. The first couple of leagues seem easy once the core gameplay is understood, but that seems subject to change based on in-game progress and future updates.------------------------------FINAL DECISION------------------------------I’m sure there’s plenty more to the game that I have not discovered yet, but these are my first impressions. I have no reason to dislike this game, and I would recommend it to anyone who finds the above information to be to their liking."

So my races sometimes turn into a biscuit machine gun simulator! All the biscuits in the air all the time! Damn good thing my sponsor is a biscuit bag company.10/10 would make it rain biscuits again.For those wondering, this game is 1 part management sim, 1 part click-timing puzzles (during races), and 1 part building inexplicable bonds with pixel dogs. It has a little story to it also which is a bonus.Fun game, although a little repetitive at times. With how communicative the devs were throughout early access I'm certain we'll see good support."

,Recommended,286240,25699403,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Sylas,"Sled DoggosDog Sled Saga is a great game that although may be a tad unengaging at times, keeps you on your feet during some tricky stages later on in the game.Story:You are a rookie dog sled racer learning the basics, building your team, figuring out the individually special traits of your dogs, and once you hit the snow, the race is on. You develop a rival who you come to race time and time again througout the game, and the races do get close at the end. There is a tale told to you about how the dog sled racing scene came to be, but I'm convinced that it's not 100% accurate.There's not much to the story other than the fact that you are trying to enter higher leagues and become famous while beating your rival.Races:You pick your lineup, which dogs go where (Wheel, Middle, Lead). Your dogs will have different capabilities on what breed they are and how you train them. Throughout the course, your dogs get exhausted, keep feeding them by lobbing food into the air at the perfect angle for them to snatch and gobble up. Don't worry if you run out, there are reload bags all along the tracks. There are some obstacles like trees that will block your throws and rocks that will require you and your dogs to leap over. Each race has different statistics such as: different team sizes, differing track lengths, amount of food reloads, amount of obstacles, and ground snow, wind, and weather quality. At the end of the races, the participating dogs may receive some popularity, experience, and stamina depending on how the race went, but for sure they will receive a certain amount of fatigue from the race.Feed your dogs to keep their energy up while avoiding obstacles, don't throw food at them when they don't want it or you'll bop 'em on their heads.Resting:When you and your dogs aren't racing, you can let them rest, you can train them, and you can pet them! This is where you can let your dogs recover from fatigue, or where you can train them and boost their levels. Later in the game you have options to hire employees; caretakers or trainers who provide additional slots and capability of training some dogs while allowing others to rest during the regimen process that moves you a day closer to the next race.Hire new dogs, say goodbye to old ones, do some training, pay your dues, get sponsorships, it's all part of your day to day life as dog sled racer.Visuals:The pixel art convinced me to buy this game, the husky on the cover to be specific. The pixel dogs are adorable and the frame-by-frame animations are so smooth.There's so much detail put into the art and it all comes together and is executed perfectly.TL;DR:A fun game that is a great buy, it may fall short to some in racing engagement and story, but it's addictive and outstanding in visuals and experience (roughly 5 hours gameplay time to reach the final league). I would recommend buying on a bigger sale (-30%+) even though I bought it at -10%. Absolutely worth it if you love dogs."

Only recommend it to those who love dogs and micromanagement.Pretty much the whole game is a simple dog sled minigame with managing dogs, staff, and eventually breeding in between.

Reading some other reviews, I'm lead to believe that it was originally intended to be an iPad game, which makes sense. Single button controls, cute and well made but simplistic graphics, and extremely limited gameplay. The races might have different snow conditions or numbers of obstacles, and the dogs different skins and traits, but the actual gameplay never changes and is ridiculously simplistic. The fact that this game costs (at the time of writing) nearly $9 is a bit preposterous. While I would happily pay $2 or $3 for this game, I would not recommend purchasing it at its current price.If you really want to look at the cute dogs, wait for the price to drop.

If you are a mom and you like dogs, or if you just like dogs, this game is for you.The racing gameplay requires attention but not overly much skill or precision. Once you get the hang of it, you will finish every race in 1st place if you are a PC gamer of any experience. As implied by my reference to iPads, it's easy to tell that this game is designed for mobile, as every action is either left clicking, left dragging, or holding left click and releasing. No right clicking, no keyboard needed.Much of the enjoyment comes from strictly-unnecessary ""cute"" features such as petting the dogs, silly hero-shot close-up portraits of the dogs when they level up, cute sound effects, and the dog happiness system. If you have ever wanted to upgrade a dog's happiness from ""good"" to ""great"" by petting it, this is your chance. The automatic name generator won me over immediately when it named one of my first dogs ""Trashboat.""The dogs each have their own personalities and quirks, but whereas a normal game might revolve around discarding characters with bad traits and hiring new ones with good traits to maximize team effectiveness, here they serve as just more fun flavor, as they aren't make-or-break in any given race.tl;dr: Dog Petting Simulator 2016, 11/10 would pet again"

I haven't even spent that much time playing this game, but the music is amazing and more some reason it just keeps popping into my head throughout the day, even if I haven't played the game in a few days.As for the actual gameplay itself, it has a good mix of player skill (such as aiming certain actions properly) and character skill (selecting dogs properly and enhancing their abilities). It is a little shallow when it comes to customizing your dogs, there isn't much you can to improve the race itself beyond making them tire less often and run a little faster.Overall I'm enjoying myself.

76561198176189179,Recommended,286240,23674089,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,lunarwolf4,"This is probably one of the most addictive games I have played recently. I first tried it at my friend's house and immediately had to buy it. I have been playing it like a maniac since then.So far I have enjoyed the game immensely, though that does not mean that I haven't noticed certain pros and cons to it.Thankfully the pros outweigh the cons. The game is a pixel game which in my case is awesome because I love pixel games. The dogs and everything is pretty detailed and with pretty darn good animations. The colors and nice and soft and don't hurt the eyes even though the majority of the game consists of various shades of white and gray (the environment).The game's racing mechanic is simple enough yet it offers a challenge, especially later in the game when you reach higher leagues. For examples, I am currently part of league 6 which involves having up to 5 dogs on your team and I have to admit I am struggling a bit more often to reach the 1st place. It takes a bit of practice and choosing the right dogs for the race becomes a lot more important. Still, it is very fun and enjoyable.Managing your team is probably my favorite part of the game. Considering all the expanses you have it is really important to keep only those dogs who work for you. However, you usually have to spend some time working with any dog to see if it's really a good match for your team. There are quite a few things to considering when creating a team for a particular race. I also love that you can now specifically train or rest your dogs and manage who will train, and who will be idle for a while. Having staff to help you with that is of great help, especially if you have a lot of dogs to work with.Unfortunately there are a few things that do bother me, though I am pretty sure they will be improved later.First of all, yes, I understand that higher leagues are meant to offer a much greater challenge when racing, but sometimes the obstacles you have to face are a bit too much. Sometimes it is a bit too difficult to get to a race that your dogs are ready for and that will give you enough money to pay your bills.Although the game has quite a few of them, I would love to see more dog breeds, but the ones who are actually suitable for dog sledding. Though I am sure that will come with time.Also, I wish there were more things to do in the game. At the moment you pretty much just race and spam the rest/train + proceed buttons. I wish we could interact with our dogs more by feeding, playing or petting, maybe make it optional to boost their happiness, or skills or something. Maybe add some real errands where you have to transport things, or help people in need, like a simple quest system that can help you financially or in some other way like free special training or something. Crafting would be a nice addition, maybe make your own food or equipment or something like that. They do plan to add breeding later to the game which will be awesome.All in all, this is a great little game to play at almost any time and I cannot recommend it enough! :D Regardless of whether you are a dog lover or not, it is a good game to play. The only real issue is that once you start playing it is definitely difficult to stop. On more than one occasion I would start playing and after a couple of minutes realize that in fact almost 2h had passed. It's an awesome game with an awesome concept that has potential to become even greater. It's just needs support! :)"

Feels like a mobile game ported to PC.Present glitches in final build allow duplication of dogs.Achievements are broken and have to be done twice to be earned.And really, just look up at the video of the gameplay up on the top of the page.No, seriously, look up at it for a sec, then ask yourself something--Looks cute, right? Looks like fun?But doesn't it look like something better suited for a phone game?For half the price?"

I have found that the game progresses nicely. You pretty much set the pace of the game. It's entirely up to you whether or not you should enter the next league. I love how the stats of the dog affect the outcome of the race, like where the dog is best positioned for example. The actual races are fun too! It's all about timing dog treats while looking out for any knots in the ropes or obstacles in your path. The graphics are cute and the music is kinda fun! And the price is nice too!

Cabin in the woods. Snowy outside. Taking care of the dogs. Really nice.Although I like playing the game, I got a feeling the game isn't quite finished. Although the gameplay during the race is really nice and smooth, I think the storyline is somewhat thin. You get updates about some old sledrider when you're back in the cabin which isn't really connected to anything in the game (at least till league 5). And then there is the fast sled rider with the turbo-husky's, which the main character keeps complaining about. The thing is when you doing alright, the fast sled rider never wins and you still are annoyed about him which seems a bit strange. At last there is some balance missing in the upgrade system. For example the most expensive trainers seem not really necessary, because the dogs are easily maintained in top condition with just the main character (at least till league 5).Did I enjoy the 2 hours I played? Yes.Will I play it again tomorrow? Yes.Am I looking forward to it? Yes."

Despite the fact that in Dog Sled Saga you don't have tons of infrastructure you can build and improve, as a game itself it is pretty entertaining. The goal itself is fairly straight forward: You are to build a winning dog racing team, make your way through the leagues, beat your rival, The Jerk, and learn a bit about a background story. It's a lot about micro-managing the dogs and your employees, with some dexterity needed for higher leagues. Despite the simple premise, it's tons of fun for the casual management nerd and doglover - for a small adventure inbetween or to fill some dull evenings, this small management gem is definitely worth a look."

The dogs have so much personality in their faces (as well as their stats).  The game is fun to play, and while I would like to have more breeds to select from, and a deeper management of their stats, it is still a great game to spend a few hours on.  Cheering on your favorites, cursing when their faults kick in at the wrong time, and laughing because your favorite dog's favorite thing is.... snow.  Fun, adorable, easy to play.  Just don't expect a deep story or complex career mode.... not yet anyway.... they are still working on it, and I look forward to see what they add.... but the bottom line is this:Even in the state the game is in NOW, it is a FUN and UNIQUE game experience.

If you like/dislike this review, please leave a comment so we can all gain something from this moment.This review is spoiler free as it gets. And I was playing this game only on PC.Dog Sled Saga is multiplatform singleplayer simulator involving racing and team management. Suitable for every age. Recommended only for those who can read English as some game mechanics and story are understandable only by reading.Gameplay:Once you've set up your team the general idea is to win as many races as possible and improve your team along the way either by improving your dogs; using money on several improvements or signing better sponsor as time goes by. Everything leads to more complicated races in higher tier leagues. If we consider day count as a goal of the game, to be the best as soon as possible, then these choices very much matter, but if you just want to have some casual fun, your team will improve over time and the order of things is not an issue.Controller of choice is my beloved PC Mouse and on few occassions even Keyboard. Everything else I found to be a hindrance to the gameplay.UI can become a bit confusing at times due to design being done for smart phone devices. I have encountered one bug in main menu few times but nothing game breaking.Graphics & Sound:Game is very easy to run on pretty much any computer, the choice was once again well crafted pixel graphics and very basic sounds. Even with very little resolution on character models, I found them adorable and very well crafted though they don't make for the best Steam page background.Sounds can be helpful in this game as they give you clues on what happenings during the race once you learn to recognize them. Some sounds were pretty hilarious especially when something fails, it bounces back with humor.I preffered playing with loud sounds and music off.Learning Curve:I have to say that first few races proved to be the toughest, the game does explaining it's mechanics very well but over time the game gets much easier than it was in the beginning and increasing in difficulty once again when you start reaching the end of the game.Uniqueness:There has to be only few games of it's kind. This game did an honest job with art style making it stand out among other games using pixel graphics. There's also an option to field a few unusual dog races for dog sledding.Story is very subtle addition to the game and doesn't affect the way you play the game.Final verdict:Very enjoyable casual game that you can turn on anytime do a few rounds and then return to it later. Altough the general loop may seem a bit repetitive, I felt this game to be rewarding and cheerful. Ultimately I was not able to put in as high amount of hours as I think I could and I'd blame the repetitivness and rich game library but on other scores the game is very solid with future improvement being teased.+ Graphics+ Simple mechanics+ Cute and cheerful+ Low HW requirements+ Price- Repetitive- UIIn it's price category I'd say this game can dominate many comers and if you feel like Dog Sledding may be your thing, give this one a try or gift it to a friend. Make your musher dream come true.I, based on my experience, recommend this game."

I really thought for a moment that my dogs were going to die if I clicked the wrong thing. Lol. Luckily that wasn't the case and what this game has going for it instead is a basic structure that pulls you in and has you constantly trying to better yourself. You might even wind up yelling at your dogs. I spent twenty minutes wanting to bury my Schnauzer in the dirt because the idiot kept getting fatiqued far too quickly, my other dogs didn't like him, and he made me lose out on TWO consecutive races even though he was REALLY good as the wheel dog!!!I highly recommend this game for any dog and snow lover. It's charming, fun, and with it's own challenges that are well worth the effort in my opinion. I even stuck the movie Snow Dogs to play on the side while I tried to build a reputable team.

So I got it and started up a save file. The dogs I chose were Neko the samoyed (Now Stacy,) Balto the saint benard, and Keiko the malamute. And these were all randomized names! I seen other reviews that were wondering why they put toy breeds in, but I don't know why either. Since it is a steam review and they're expecting me to list pros and cons, I'll just put them here.Pros:-DOGS!-Good game to waste the time.-I like the pixel art style. The visuals appeal to me.-You can have puppies! They're cuter than heck, and the name for the program is ""Build a Puppy.""-The name of the mountain though. Mountain Saint Something. I can imagne the developers saying: ""We need to name a mountain! Quick, Bob! What should it be called??"" *Bob is working on saint benards* ""SAINT SOMETHING!""-I like the story behind it.Cons:-League six.-It gets a little boring and repetative after an hour or so.-There are no yorkshire terriers! Games are never complete without yorkies!(regret the last thing I said and only think about those two as my only cons)I really enjoyed the 38 hours of gameplay into it!

There is no volume control on the music or sound effects - so you can either have them turned ON (and very loud), or OFF. There is no explanation as to what some of the more obscure options are (""Catch Cursor""? ""Sharp scale""?). These should be explained simply so players know whether to turn them off or on.Also, the other thing that really bothers me about this game are the dog breeds that you can choose from. Husky and Malamute are fine, but Labradors? St. Bernards? Schnauzers? Worst of all, Shih-Poos? Seriously? These breeds are NOT sled dogs by any stretch of the imagination, and they kind of break my immersion in enjoying the game when I see them on the ""Hire Dog"" list.The game presents itself as otherwise somewhat ""realistic"" otherwise - I can't hire unicorns for my team, and I can't put rockets on my sled for speed boosts, plus there are weather and track conditions that affect my run - so having completely unrealistic dog breeds on my sled team really ruins it for me. I wish there was an option to only hire sled-appropriate breeds (and there are plenty actual dog breeds to choose from that are acceptable as sled dogs).So this game needs a few serious tweaks - some improvements to the Options menu, some more dog breeds to choose from (and the removal of the ridiculous breeds or the option to filter them out in the Hire Dog menu), and possibly some other things to do besides run races. Some simple minigames to play with your dogs inbetween races would be fantastic.Otherwise, the game is enjoyable, and cute - a good way to spend some time, but it becomes repetitive quickly when all you can do is run races."

It's got that ""one more turn"" feel to it for me but I do hope they continue to support the game in the near future with updates or a dlc. It's a pretty straight forward game with some trial and error. There are plenty of videos online that explain the mechanics and features for you to check out.I think what would give this title a little more staying power is if they developed the leagues piece a little more. I'd like to be able to track the history of my team performance vs. other sledding teams. Another great addition would be if the dogs aged and you had to retire them. You could keep them around for breeding until they die of natural causes, sell them for profit, or give them away to a loving family...all of these choices could give your dogs in the kennel certain perks or affect morale in some way.I could even see multiplayer being pretty fun with this game. But that would probably take more dev team members to be able to do.At any rate, it's been a fun little game that is easy to play in short bursts. Definitely worth seven bucks in my opinion."

,Recommended,286240,14967096,"Posted: 19 March, 2015",all,Bayhound,"Good mechanics, catchy music, and an art style that's easy on the eyes make this quite the addicting little game! Even though it seems simple at first, there are lots of different things that factor into races that make each one a challenge - especially when adding new dogs to your team or placing up in a higher league. There's more strategy involved than I first realized as well! As fun as this game is, though, I found it fairly easy, and after roughly 5 hours of gameplay I've managed to go as far as I possibly can with my current team. Despite that, this game is definitely worth the price, and I have high hopes that more things will be implimented before it leaves early access.Pros:+ You have to interact/race with each individual dog to learn and unlock their quirks; the perfect dog just insn't handed to you (although more traits are visible when buying dogs in higher leagues)+ The dogs have personalities and can have rapport with teammates!+ Races truly seem randomized, don't think I've encountered the same course twice+ Weather and snow conditions affect the race!+ Refreshing breeds available. Never thought I'd see a Shih-poo or Schnauzer in a dog sled race!+ Lots of different fault, skills, and other quirks each dog can have+ Neat color choices for harnesses/names/accents for each dogCons:- Not very many breeds to choose from. Yes, there are 10 ""different"" dogs altogether, but three of those are just different colors of husky, not individual breeds. Greenland Dogs, American Eskimos, Alaskan Huskies, Pointers, Chows, Mutts even - there are plenty more breeds that are apt for racing that I'd love to see included!- You can't return/resell dogs once they're acquired. I feel like this would be a very good thing to add to the game, especially once you get to the higher leagues and find you have 12 dogs or so, five of which you don't race anymore because they have undesirable faults that keep you from winning a race. I hate seeing dogs ""rot"" away in the cabin with no use.- Only one save file. I know I personally would explore the game much more if I had three or so files to have different teams in!- No real plot/objectives. Race. Add dogs to your team to qualify for higher leagues. Then what? What happens after league seven? What else is there to do at Firebowl Kennels (not sure if correct name)? Winning race after race and sitting on over 200k with no end goal in mind gets boring after a while."

Now I can give my final review and thoughts, both the good and the bad. Overall, I find that this game is extremely charming with adorable pixel graphics, but it also shares a few problems like everything else.I LOVE this game to death, it was really fun to play from start to finish. There's so many dogs to choose from, with lots of sled and leash colors to choose from. The new breeding mechanic also doubles the fun, making me some adorable puppers! Racing is fun, and I enjoy figuring out the ups and downs of my dogs. It's nice to know that each dog is unique in personality and has different skills for your team. Many dog lovers will find this fun and adorable.Sometimes I do have to put Dog Sled Saga on the shelf, I often get bored when playing for too long as the gameplay can feel pretty repetitive. I also feel the full release has a serious lack of dog breeds to choose from, which is fine since 'most' of them are made for this kind of job, but a lot of them aren't. With so many breeds in the world I understand that they had to stop somewhere, and there is already a nice roster, but there's quite a few popular breeds that weren't included. I do hope eventually there might be some DLC, or just updates continuing to add more.Dog Sled Saga is a fun and short game to play, it's great for a quick sitdown as it isn't as demanding or as time consuming as other games. Its arcade-like style allows it to stand on its own feet as a fun and addictive game.(for those who TL;DR)Pros:- Adorable Art Style- Fun and Simple Gameplay.- Can Play on Almost Any Computer.- Cute Music.- Dog Personality Traits and Features.Cons:- Lack of Dog Breeds.- Gets Repetitive.- No Pugs.The low price is definitely worth the game, I enjoy it a lot!"
