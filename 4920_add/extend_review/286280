,Recommended,286280,14754013,"Posted: 5 March, 2015",all,Spbaron,"In a world of WWII or modern tank sims, this highly realistic title covers two vintage tanks that have never really been simulated in detail previously. So far, the realism and AI seem pretty top notch. In addition, exterior graphics such as tank models are very nicely modeled. Finally, the fact that this game features somewhat functional 3d tank interiors automatically puts this title above any other modern tank sims, that is of course because we haven't seen any interior tank models since Operation Flashpoint! (correct me if I'm wrong) Drawbacks? The interface navigation is a bit confusing and takes some getting used to. In addition, graphically the 3d interior models and land environment seem a bit dated to today's standards. Evidently, this game is not categorized as early access, but probably SHOULD be as it doesn't really feel like a finished product. Otherwise, if you like obscure vintage tanks in long forgotten conflict zones, (which I totally do!) this sim's for you!"

I suggest it for people that want a hardcore game and that do not shy away from spending some hours into getting used to the game and its interface. I do not recommend it for people that just want to drive around blowing stuff up, because the realistic engagement ranges and punishing difficulty make this kind of playstyle very hard to achieve.Pro:-Detailed simulation of vehicular warfare-Detailed and realistic maps, vehicles, driving and damage physics-Lots of control over your AI squad or own tanks crew in either direct commander mode or through the map interface-Dynamic campaign, giving plenty of replayability-Customizable difficulty and realism levels-Detailed Encyclopedia of the game content and its propertiesMids:-Decent messagebox tutorial that can be turned on or off with an interface button-Graphics are aged, but still detailled. Texture quality has suffered somewhat though-Slow paced gameplay is rewarded, because your tank is quite fragile when hit with anti tank weaponry-After Action Reports give a detailed view what hit a tank, from where and what damage has been done, allowing for improving ones playstyle in the futureCons:-Very hard to learn controls, due to somewhat unintuitive keyboard shortcuts/layout-Interface is a bit cluttered to allow every action to be done with the mouse-Hard to learn game, steep learning curve and very punishing in case of strategic or tactical failure-Texture quality is considered low now and makes some assets unpleasant to look at-Eyestrain might be caused by using the rangefinder that overlays two images to the player. You have to find the non-blurry version of the object you want to shoot at to dial in the correct range (gunning/rangefinding can be done by the AI though)Some more detailed comments:Steel Armor: Blaze of War is a game that has been out for quite some time. It was released late 2011 and unfortunately had a rough launch with lots of dispute between the developer and publisher. Now that these things have been moved to the past, the developer has aquired the rights back to his own game and implemented all the fixes that they have been released so far inofficially as the official new version of the game in hope to be able to support and release more content, now that they own their IP."
,Recommended,286280,15056741,"Posted: 26 March, 2015",all,M0rdresh,"This is an excellent tank simulation game, easily among the best available. It is not to be mistaken with any tank action game of any sort, so don't expect arcade gameplay. This game is about learning how to operate (either as commander, driver, gunner or loader) an American M60A1 and  a Russian T-62 main battle tank, both cold war era machinery. The developers practically crawled into both of these I've been told, this in order to create the cockpit and internal layout as accurate as possible, this is the real deal.The cockpit or inside experience of these tanks are no small part in this game. Every little detail is present and the crew is fully represented and accurately animated. When firing a short you can witness the loader to pickup another around of ammunition and load it up the cannon. You can easily switch roles are you see fit, playing the gunner for example and receiving orders from the A.I. commander on your targets, distance and whatnot. Very impressive.As an interesting addition the developers decided to also implement an operational part to the game, elements they carried over from their excellent Graviteam Operation Star strategy game. Here you can command platoons of tanks, infantry and motorized vehicles. So while operating your tank commanding your, excellent graphically represented, crew to battle victory, you can also issue orders and command an entire tank platoon. This by way of communicating orders and/or tactical map of the entire battlefield.The Ukrainian developers have pored a lot of love into this one and it does show. Like I said earlier, this is really for the simulation loving crowd, not the 'World of Tank' player seeking instant action. This game requires thought, learning and researching, but offers a virtual dive into how it must have felt to operate these metal beasts..."

The physics, for a tank simulator, are quite nice. They may be even more realistic than my knowledge. This game is a great simulator, especially for those who enjoy a slow paced fighting game. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes simulators. It's just that good.P.S; the graphics for the environment are spectacular. The dust, bushes, shrubs, rivers, and desert all add to the spice. And the best part is: if you run over a bush, it'll fall.10/10, best game."
,Recommended,286280,18041318,"Posted: 15 September, 2015",all,Randall,"A lot of crap gets given to Steel Armor - Blaze of War because there are only two operational tank models to use.  That is a bit of a misconception.  Yes there are only the T-62 and M60A1 to be driven and operated... BUT in most battles you are a part of a tank squad, platoon, company or all three, therefore you are able to interchange between multiple numbers of M60A1s and T-62s.  You are also able to give orders to Infantry, APCs, other tank variations like the T-55, Chieftain, and Olifant, Aircraft and other units via the Tactical Map.  If you've played Graviteam Tactics, it's basically the exact same thing, so really this game could be seen as an add-on to Graviteam Tactics, or Graviteam Tactics could be seen as an add-on to Steel Armor... I'm not really sure which came first.  But yes, you can only control the T-62 and the M60A1 but that is no where near the only unit in the game.The settings are a bit odd... Afghanastan 1979-1989.  Iran 1980-1988.  Angola 1975-2002.  Most of those areas are not your typical, main stream maps, but once you get into one of the tanks you won't really care.You could also say that it's not as fun as a World War 2 tank sim would be, and as I would mostly agree with you, the tanks involved in this game are not so advanced as to take away what made WWII an interesting and challenging fight.  There are no radar guided missiles, lazer beams, etc.  It's still hardcore and fairly straightforward basic combat reminiscent of the battles of WWII."

The graphics are a bit dated and so is the audio but other then that its pretty good for being what it is. From what i have seen so far the unit/squad control is some what similar to the Arma series bit way more in depth and allows you to operate tank platoons with Infantry support, you can operate all stations of the tank (not sure about the loader) . my only issue is that the game has quite a bit of a learning curve, I'm unfamiliar with the series but considering this game was put onto steam i figured why not, i like tanks and it has tanks. Also the UI is kinda annoying, its better then the DCS ground units but its still i had to look up the controls to hop into a tank. The ballistics in the game seen pretty realistic, you could compare it to Warthunder Ground Forces but having as much detail inside the tank as the outside, i am not sure if the armor of the tanks are similar to WT as in modules instead of numbers like WOT. So far as where the game stands i give it a 8/10. Main reason is that it seems like they have bumped up the price tag, someone told me you could have got this game for about $5 before it went to steam, i did look around and could not confirm that so do not let that stop you from trying it out."
,Recommended,286280,16982501,"Posted: 10 July, 2015",all,Car Bomb,"I've been playing a (I have to admit) cracked version and waiting for this game to come to Steam for years, and I bought the game the moment I saw it on Steam. I think it deserves every single cent, and is probably the most detailed post WWII tank simulator that everyone can reach and afford (who manages to get their hands on a copy of Steel Beasts anyway.)The attention to detail in this game is great, both in the tactics phase and in the real battle phase. Supply, fuel, ammo and fatigue levels, weapon and armor characteristics are simulated quite nicely in the tactics phase. But even if you don't care for commanding platoons and you're just playing the game to simply hang out in a tank, the fact that this game has 3d interiors is enough of a reason to buy it for armor enthusiasts.Attention to detail results in a quite unforgiving game especially in terms of vision and damage; more often than not, battles consist of scanning for enemies than actually shooting at them. This may feel underwhelming for Rambo wannabes seeking to crash tanks into helos and stuff. When things get hot, though, the sound of rounds ricocheting off your armor alone is enough to force you into a fetal position, covering your ears.The 3 campaigns that are in game do a good job of representing the common types of warfare: Inf vs Armor, Armor vs Armor, Combined Arms vs Combined Arms. Note that the attention to detail is true for the campaigns, too. They aren't story driven, so they aren't necessarily supposed to be won if you follow a path or something. Sometimes you seal your fate in the 3rd turn with a less-than-optimal move, and you don't realize it until the 6th turn when the enemy crushes you utterly.That might be just me, but the graphics look better than it did on the non-Steam version. Yes, it shows age, but it is still on par with ArmA 2 which should be more than enough if it is a simulation you're looking for.It should be noted that the game does leave some things to be desired.First of all, the game doesn't make a serious attempt to, I don't know, be learned? And I'm not talking about the difficulty or complexity level here. The tutorials (which AFAIK simply didn't exist as separate levels in the non-Steam version), while nice additions, are far from adequately polished. Failure to read one sentence of essential info when it appears on screen can force you to restart the whole tutorial level, as the game offers you no easy way of going back to previous messages.Optimization seems to be a slight issue. I have no problem getting a constant 55-60 FPS like 90% of the time. But especially when moving in a column with other tanks, the dust kicked up by their treads cause the FPS to dip all the way down to 20-25. This is not a game-breaking performance failure though; you simply can't see and shoot through that dust and smoke anyway, so the lowered FPS doesn't impair your aiming, it just slightly annoys you for a few seconds until the dust settles.The menus kind of feel more clunky than the actual gameplay, and you would have thought that driving a 40-ton tank would feel clunky. Sometimes pressing the buttons doesn't really do anything; you have to go for that sweet spot that's like, not in the middle of the button and also not on the edge of it or something. You will figure it out.Also, currently it seems like you can't assign more than one button for an action. And I haven't yet managed to get this game to change the control scheme or detect my gamepad, but that might just be the inability on my part. (I appreciate all suggestions)Long story short, SABOW is an essential part of any simulation collection. As in any military sim, it is an acquired taste. Learn to enjoy its strong points and ignore its weak ones, and you have a game you will keep coming back for more. Also, just look at that abbreviation.SABOW!

And by far this is the most complex tank sim like with DCS.  Don’t let that put you off.  It’s beautiful once you get to know her and take her out time to time.  It’s not as bad as DCS but the detail is there.  You will want to keep your tanks alive but that will not happen.  You will die due to the enemy tanks better armor at times.  You will suffer losses.  This is war and this is a tank simulator.I don’t write reviews but for this one I will.  I would say this is what everyone wants when they play a table top strat game when you want to fight the individual battles in detail.  Graphics are great if you have a good computer which I do.

,Recommended,286280,21587026,"Posted: 2 March, 2016",all,Junta,"A well-detailed tank simulation of Cold War era's M60A1 and T62 tanks with almost non-existent tutorial and a steep learning curve that is well worth it.Since it is based on Graviteam Tactics engine apart from directly controlling tanks you are also able to give orders to other troops under your command (or give the control away to AI if you want to concentrate on a pure tanking).Tank cockpits are nicely detailed, crew members are animated - however the actual interactivity is at the minimum, mostly done via shortcuts and interface buttons. Nonetheless cockpits provide some good immersion.Campaigns in the game are about capturing victory points on a large map, where combat encounters are being generated on the fly depending on the situation. Both you and the enemy have limited pool of units and reinforcements, attrition, fuel and ammo running out play a large role in the ultimate outcome. Altogether this means that no playthrough is ever the same. Plus as a nice touch every destroyed vehicle and killed infantry stays on the map permanently, across every encounter in that area.There is also a Quick Battle generator, where it is fast and easy to set up whatever combat encounter you want, with any mix of forces, on any map area, controlled by you or an AI ally.In Cold War era depicted in the game tank crews are not as blind as they were during WW2, while still not having all the tools that make tanks such an effective weapon platforms they are today. Night vision devices are passive, low res, and have to be supported by IR spotlights, otherwise there's little you can see at night. Coincidence rangefinders require constant manual control and thus the shot requires a lot more time to be perfectly lined up. Gun stabilization is only in its infancy so a lot more skill is required from gunners to land a hit. As a result all of this provides for some tight combat, not present in other, more modern tank simulations.The game has some downsides of course. Interface is quite bad and does not feature even half the commands that keyboard shortcuts let you access. Tutorials do not exist, apart from pop ups describing what a given button does. There are still minor bugs and pathfinding in cluttered areas is wonky.Despite all of these issues - it is one of the best tank sims out there."

You play the role of a battallion commander using a tank as a command vehicle.  As a result, there is no floating camera to move around the battlefield and you only directly participate in a battle if you can actually enter a tank in that battle.During battle, you can take the position of any member of a tank crew while communicating with the rest of the crew as each member performs his functions.  You will have to command your troops from the commander's station of your tank, with not much more than your map, binoculars, tank optics and radio.Each battle happens organically throughout each historically accurate campaign and can involve anywhere from a couple of sqauds to hundreds of units.  Combined arms plays an important role.  There are heavy and light armored vehicles, air units, anti-armor and anti-air units, heavy and light machine guns, artillery, mortars and various kinds of infantry.If you enjoy GTOS, this game uses many of the same mechanics.  It's a great buy for GTOS fans because it brings you to the first-person level for battles, creating new challenges and a different kind of immersion.Like other Graviteam titles, this game is dificult to learn but rewarding.

If you like simulation BUY THIS, if you like tanks BUY THIS simulator now!HIGHLY RECOMMEDED!__________________________I wholeheartedly recommend this simulator. The immersion factor is 10/10, from the rain, to the vegetation, to the light and people around you. To how they act and how the war is waged in this simulator.Very few games or simulators can make me feel like I'm there, this did. The African vegetation is spot on, and the lighting coupled with the trees and grass immerses you to no end. It makes you feel like you are a tiny battalion of tanks lost in nowhere, and the sight of a village is both a great thing and bad, as it may mean more fighting. May mean fighting? Yes, because the missions are dynamic, based on a dynamic campaign. So no mission is alike, and giving you a replayability like no other!The dynamic campaign is really deep and interesting, and you can also choose to ignore it if you so like. The controls are intuitive and it has a nice UI in case you feel lost with buttons.Everything is nicely explained, and including the training missions. Which is what I suggest you do before you venture any deeper. Even the campaign has tooltips and explaining what you can do.I would also like to make a special mention to the incredible engine they have here. The mud, terrain deformation, and even small rivers and banks. For example, if a tank crosses a small creek, and with it lowering the terrain further, which will cause the tank behind you to be unable to cross. This is because the small crossing ended up damaged by your tanks track.Amazing details like that make one hell of a difference in anything!I also would like to mention how interesting it is the repairing mechanic, watching your crew repair your tank, to the ballistics simulation and how even small details are modelled. Like when it rains, your tank gets shiny and wet.The developers are very friendly, and they answer all questions, especially on their own forums. They are still updating this gem, and there is a patch almost every month.This simulator is simply amazing.

There are two playable tanks in the game, the T-62 and the M60A1, both have fully 3D modeled  interiors and most if not all systems in the tanks are operational.There are three campaigns in the base game, each with two sub-campaigns for each faction as well as a fourth campaign avaliable as a DLC. The included factions that you can play as are Angola, Iran, Iraq and the USSR, I think you can also play as a Cuban tank crew. The large & numerous maps are incredibly fun to play on, and they all offer a unique experience and require different tactics for the different types of terrain.The phsyics of the game are also incredibly realistic, firing your gun over long distances will cause bullet drop which you need to account if you are to hit your desired target.Some people have complained about the lack of tanks, while I would have liked to see some legends such as the T-72, T-55, Chieften etc. I beleive that the quality of the playable tanks in the game easily makes up for the quantity of them.The BadWhile this game is incredibly fun and realistic, it does have some minor problems, but these are certainly not game breaking,- Occasional but minor audio glitches- Driver AI is sometimes quite frustrating (Probably just my poor commanding skills to be honest)- Mission editor had a lot of potential, fully customisable scenarios and a 3D editor would be great.SummarySteel Armor: Blaze of War is incredibly fun and realistic tank simulator with a good variety of maps and vehicles, all in all I would highly recommend this game."

No, you are a tankman in a tank that feels heavy, where you have to calculate a distance to your target, avoid water and hope you get other tank before it gets you.The game is so complex and if you ever wanted to be a tankman, this is the closest you can get, besides Steep Beast Pro which costs a lot.You wanna be a tankman, I mean a real tankman, this is the closest you can get on Steam.Because it's a slower paced one, every kill will feel really rewarding. It does not have Multiplayer, only SinglePlayer in form of Historical battles and mission editor where you can make battles by yourself.You only have control of two tanks, T-62 and M60, too bad devs didn't included more tenks to operate, it would be great if they had made a DLC with T-72.When comes to most accurate and realistic tank simulators, you have:1st place: Steel Beasts Pro2nd place: This game3rd place: T-72 Iron Warriors aka T-72 Balkans on Fire4th place: T-34 vs TigerHighly recomended."

Non penetration shots can also cause significant damages to your vehicles. In some scenarios, my tanks got knocked out just because of non penetration rounds.

So you don't get many of the fancy features you see in the modern tanks of Steel Beasts, but I would argue this makes for more engaging gameplay.-Limited mission editor. You can only save one custom mission at a time, and you can't download additional missions online. The game comes with ~10 premade missions, but they play more like advanced tutorials. However I think the numerous dynamic campaigns more than makes up for this.-Instant action is really just a premade mission.

Really, the only choice for that is Steel Beasts Pro, which carries a hefty price tag and has very little in the way of singleplayer content.In walks Steel Armor: Blaze of War. SABOW is an armor sim (you aren't required to memorize startup sequences, but everything relevant to combat is simulated as accurately as it needs to be) set primarily during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Iraq is equipped with the Soviet T-62, Iran has the US-produced M60A1. There are other scenarios in different periods, but they always use one of those two tanks as their player-controlled units. The game is really broken into two components: A turn based strategy segment, where the player moves around groups of men and vehicles around a large battlespace, and then a real time segment which plays out the engagements set up on the turn based map. The player is responsible, in this real time segment, for controlling units under their command to fight whatever enemy they've encountered, all while usually also commanding their own tank and tank platoon.In the real time segment, the player can choose to occupy any position within their tank and assume the responsibilities of that crew position. Usually, though, you'll be playing as the tank commander, giving orders to your driver to move to different positions, searching for targets and then ranging them for your gunner to engage (there are no laser rangefinders in SABOW- the M60A1 has a optical coincidence rangefinder where a lens on either side of the tanks turret is focused on the target, determining its range, the T-62 has a simple stadiameter), then searching for more targets. SABOW gets across very well how difficult armored combat is without high magnification independently-traversable optics, thermal imaging systems, and precision fire control and stabilization hardware. Often times, in a tank versus tank engagement, whoever sees the other first is the one who wins, and the greatest danger to your tank are anti-tank infantry hiding in bushes with RPGs, or recoilless rifle emplacements which are only visible from range when they fire. Likewise, SABOW does a good job of conveying how horrifying it is to be in a tank under fire, hearing rounds thud off your armor plate while you desperately search for their source. Even being on the winning side is pretty horrific, watching the tank you just perforated with a sabot round creep forward for a few meters as gouts of flame pour out of its hatches, the crew climbing out while burning alive, put down by a merciful salvo from your tank's coaxial MG.SABOW has a lot of content, if you're into this sort of thing. Dynamic campaigns, an easy to use mission generator, as well as fixed single mission scenarios. You can even try your hand at night fighting in a tank, using your horrible gen 1 night vision to try and spot targets that are within arms length of you. If you're at all a fan of semi-modern armored warfare, especially if you enjoy either of the two player tanks modeled (keep in mind the M60A1 is a base model A1- no AOS, No TIS, maybe a RISE kit but that's mostly non-combat stuff), SABOW is worth the asking price. Please buy this game to convince the devs to make more like it."

There's a reason why most people stop playing after 18hrs of gametime invested. The strategy part is completely uncalled for and is an unnecessary burden. The maps are bland, literally just a few deserts and a jungle savannah. The UI is clunky ( I cant even configure my control scheme thanks to this) and the translations are less than stellar.On the upside, the devs put excellent effort into modeling the tanks, you can look around the inside and interact with buttons, switches, dials, etc. The tank gameplay is a challenging and a blast at the same time.Final recommendation:Unless you really like the idea of RTS and tank sim in forgotten conflicts, the $30 asking price is too much for this rough game.My recommendation to the devs:- Add in a basic LAN MP capabilty to have players coming back and build a good community- Either abandon or make optional the RTS element, nobody asked for it- Get YouTubers like BaronVonGamez, PhlyDaily or Frankie to make a video or two on this game (preferably after adding MP)"

There are only 2 tutorials in which a novice to the game doesn't find himself under fire from very live enemies within minutes of starting the mission. The controls are very badly explained, and very few of them are covered before the battle begins, at which point it's frankly hopeless to expect a novice like myself to be paying attention to the few and far between text tips if I want to survive for even a minute or two. Add to this the fact that many of the keys the player is instructed to press are simply the wrong ones, and you're left with a bloody mess of an experience I'm afraid.Though ~3 times as expensive, I wish I'd gotten Steel Beasts instead. At least that game has an understandable, useful UI and is easier to get a grasp of.Edit: Having delved deeper into this product, I can safely say that it is simply a pathetic excuse for an arcade game, let alone a simulator. For everything that generates a positive experience, there will be a dozen equally large factors that results in nothing else than an unrealistic, buggy, badly designed awful gameplay experience. The devs have demonstrated lacking a fundamental understanding of how SABOT ammunition works, of how to produce an acceptable AI pathfinding, a realistic campaign, crew/unit management, etc. Add to this your average Eastern block ""nationalistic"" take on Soviet tanks, and the recipe is complete. T-55s on the lowest skill setting will literally speaking return fire, hit and destroy M60s at the highest skill setting with the first round.If you consider buying this, then keep this in mind: This game is from a developer that doesn't think that you should be able to expect MP in the 21st century simulator. Yes, MP as in multiplayer. Let that stand as an indication to how fundamentally twisted this mess is.If you're looking for an armour sim, then this is not for you.

Seeing snide comments from the Dev's to people asking questions doesn't help sell me on it either. I really tried hard to like it. Whill the game does have high reviews and what appears to be a loyal core following there are just to many little things for this game to work for me. Sorry for the lack of specifics, but it's one of those things where you don't care for something but you just can't seem to put it to words, so it is with me and this game. For me $30 not well spent..."

Do I recommend this game at this price? No. Still this is best game available on this subject. Hopefully patched fix some issues, mainly improving AI and minimizing micromanagement that way.ORIGINAL OPINIONI seriously regret buying this game at this price (~30 euros). People tell how good tank simulation this is, well that may be the case when you get to the tank driving phase.Tried the battle editor so I could practice with the russian tank, after a looong while staring at map with useless symbols and useless ""help"" I really start feel that this game should be more about tanks and less about micromanaging ""allies"".I'l get to actual tank simulator at some point but so far this game has been a major disappointment."

I've tried this for nearly 4 hours - maybe it is a good game but it's just unplayable on 3 screens.  You don't even see the whole menu as it doesn't display properly - so maybe I'm missing all sortes of other info?  Game also crashes a hugh amount - I have never been able to return to main menu - it just crashed every time.  I love tank games but just don't like this experience but I feel as though I'm missing out big time.
,Not Recommended,286280,28549266,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,~CaNdLeBoX~,This game is a joke. Five minutes into game...Abandon Tank over & over again!. Only a handfull of missions to play and they all suck. Tank wont even fire half the time. The tutorial is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's funny. The tutorial messages pop up on screen while playing and half of them make no sence what so ever. Go ahead and buy it and you will see. Bet you get a refund.
