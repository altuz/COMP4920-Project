,Recommended,286320,16542393,"Posted: 19 June, 2015",all,Wild Irish Rose 🌹🏰🌙,"I am giving this game a ""big thumbs up"" because it is SOO much more than that...it was an experience.  First off, being of where it was made from then I do have to admit I came into it biased already determined to like it. (My grandfather hails from Sweden.  And parts of the game even contained folklore from a song sung to me as a child.)  However I still gave it a fair and open mind to let myself decide truthfully how I felt about it.  The graphics, for being simple as far as without a large color spectrum that is, were ABSOLUTELY amazing and fantastic!!  The understated colors did not distract in the least in my opinion from game play or the story...they placed them strategically and where they would matter most I felt.   The story line was very developed and complex. (When you get to the end then you will understand, and hopefully agree, why I say this.)  I was in complete surprise at the ending and also quite moved and left with a feeling of ""WOW!""...speechless, as it were.  There are so many great things I could say about this game.  I very much liked the feature that when you need to combine items or give them to an NPC then you cannot make a mistake as the game will not let you pursue the wrong scenario.  The most of the puzzles were challenging, but not too much.  You do have an option to have either the voice or to have captions.  However certain small parts did require you to have just voice.  (I am guessing these were the areas that only the Swedish language was available and the Steam profile for the game does state this so it was not a surprise in the least for me.)  There were even a couple of more challenging achievements.  Also, in addition, the price is very reasonable and I would have even paid twice as much...it is that good.  So in closure, I highly reccomend this game to any one looking for unique game play, an original story (it is based on Swedish folklore), point and clicks, or even a calm and quicker game to experience."

76561198006541362,Not Recommended,286320,20074641,"Posted: 29 December, 2015",all,stranger1982,"Oknytt's tale starts with an unnamed, insignificant creature slowly emerging in a dark world: having no idea of its role in the big scheme of things the creature embarks on a journey to find its purpose.Oknytt has alot going for it thanks to its charming art, creatures and lore coming from Swedish mythology and a pretty interesting story but it sadly becomes somewhat of a niche game due to its often cryptic, illogical puzzles that can easily stop your progress.PROS:-good art style creates an appropriately dark world populated by mysterious creatures-nice soundtrack-the narrator does a good job both in telling the tale and voicing its various creatures-interesting storyCONS:-puzzles go from unoriginal to downright obscure-rune system is nice but too random in its actual operation-a bit too reliant on pixel hunting-lacking in animations-FMVs look pixelatedhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=587153099Oknytt is decent and it has alot of charm in its art style and story but I sadly found it extremely lacking in its actual puzzles, hence the thumbs down despite the fact that this is not a bad game at all.Puzzles suffer from a ""try every object on everything"" syndrome as I feel their directions are a tad too vague or they're based on abstruse item combinations. Said items are also often a bit too well hidden in the environment, something made worse by the mostly black and white graphics, or can be gathered through interacting with every single object in a scene, something that can get dull quickly. Last but not least some puzzles or items require you to use the four elemental runes at your disposal: sadly this also soon becomes a dull affair as you're basically forced to try each rune in every scene hoping for something to happen.All things considered I feel the obtuse and somewhat badly designed puzzles are a bit too much for an adventure game to earn a recommendation as I think only seasoned fans of the genre will find the weird logic behind them easy enough to progress at a steady pace. Still, if you feel you can easily tackle hard puzzles or use a guide then you'll be able to properly enjoy its art and story, making it a decent purchase."
76561198141404871,Recommended,286320,19118251,"Posted: 16 November, 2015",all,joan4003,"Storyline: On the darkest of nights when creatures and spirits rarely seen by man abound, a lost(?) traveler/wanderer is invited to join a campfire and listen to a tale.  The tale told by the invisible narrator is about a small insignificant nameless creature born out of darkness on the darkest of nights much like that night.  This epic journey of self-awareness and discovery turns into a magic strewn and danger filled quest which takes place in a single night full of magic and spirits taken from Swedish forklore.Gameplay: This point and click game is divided into five distinct chapters, two of which are subdivided.  Each chapter is its own unique adventure quest with a build and use inventory,  Inventory items carry over from chapter to chapter, and all items are eventually used and have a purpose, generally logical.  (I note this only because some items found in chapter one are not used until chapter five.)  Look around carefully in each scene for other areas (found at the edges of the screen) and for items and locations to examine.  Nothing is hidden but lack of careful examination makes it easy to miss things.The ""examine"" button is LEFT-CLICK.  (Please read the tutorial for mouse functions.  The way the game plays is a bit different functionally but easy once the player gets used to it.)  On the examination triangle is LORE (a scroll), SPEECH (conversation bubble), and TAKE (a hand).  I suggest clicking on all three.  LORE for the folk history of the spirit or place encountered and eventually for achievement completion.  SPEECH for the story narration, told as only an excellent verbal storyteller can tell it.   TAKE to gather the item.   Some inventory items are added automatically while others are not.  Some inventory items can be combined together to create something new while others are given to the spirits and creatures encountered.The game is mostly mono-chrome in color, with dark blues, deep violets and shiny white to off-set this dark night shrouded world.There are four elemental magics: earth, water, fire, and wind that the insignificant creatures has control over.  These magics are essential to game play, and certain tasks can not be completed without using the correct magic(s).  I suggest using all the magics on every scene just to see what happens because generally something happens when each elemental magic is used the first time.  (Nice detail to the game play.)Each chapter (or sub-chapter in two cases) has its own set of tasks to complete and puzzles to solve.  The puzzles have no directions, and the clues to solving them must be sought out and inferred from environmental references or conservational text.  Most are head scratching brain twisters and CANNOT be skipped. (There is at least one excellent guide on Steam if the player gets stuck.)There is no going back to previous areas once the game progresses, and there is little backtracking per se in each chapter.  Chapters three and five have sub-chapters.  Chapters one and five(part one) are set up in a circular fashion. Chapters two, three (part two) and four are back and forth travel along the central path which has branch paths off of it where tasks needed to be accomplished are.  Most tasks are logical and the player uses more or less what they think they need.  (Do not forget to combine inventory items.)In the final analysis this is a story-rich narrated tale, and the game play takes a back seat to the tale being told."

UI is from somewhere the 90s but augmented with a nice original ""rune powers"" UI that affect the environment somehow. Basic clicking UI is tediously slow and constantly blocks input while waiting the action to complete.The idea of narrating the story maybe sounded nice at the development table but no: narrator got so irritating after nth time of ""small creature this small creature that"" that I almost uninstalled the game. This could have been fixed by substituting ""small creature"" with simple ""it"". Well whatever I wouldn't still wanted to listen the narrator. Sound design is good and bad at the same time. Usually there's nice ambient around but once I had to turn off all the sounds in ch4 while doing the turning stone puzzle because there was this constantly crying bird/animal at the background. This combined to infinitely slow UI and even more slowly animations with three tries at a row would've been an impossible task.There's a game helper telling what could be the objective right now but it was still difficult to figure out what to do sometimes. Well maybe not difficult, just tedious. You can't inspect inventory items to get more insight of them. Also if you make unsuccesful item-combination you always have to listen narrator say ""that didn't happen"".The praise:-nice atmosphere and original grapics-rune UI-loreThe nag:-narrating and sound design-too few clues in the environment-blocking and slow UI"

Oknytt offers classic gameplay, great art and simple but interesting story and, in my opinion, it is enough for point and click quest.First of all, I want to mention art style. Game is beautiful, each screen and each character is carefully drawn. Oknytt looks dark, places and characters we encounter are quite unfriendly and sometimes even sinister, but the game itself is not scary. It is a kind of a mini-tour through scandinavian folklore, a short meeting with mysterious creatures that inhabit it. I really liked the bestiary, it was interesting and informative for me.Plot is very simple and does not include unexpected twists. On the other hand, I must admit that I did not understand the ending. Why game ended this way? Perhaps I am not enough familiar with the scandinavian myths, so I can not see something important? Well, I do not know.Puzzles are decent. Most of time, game is just about gathering and using weird stuff and junk here and there, but there is some actual puzzles. They are not too hard and can be easily solved, but these puzzles fit well in game, they seemed quite interesting for me, so I enjoyed them. I wish there was more puzzles and less ""stuff-gathering""... well, alright, it is better than nothing and, of course, it is only my small insignificant opinion.Well, and about narration... please, do not get me wrong, narrator did very good job, but... this voice, ""no, this is not how it happened"", now this words are stuck in my brain like nails! ""Small insignificant creature"", you say... well, nevermind.So. I think, I can recommend Oknytt if you like point and click quests. It is not perfect, while art style is excellent, gameplay is only decent... but, in my opinion, for a short walk through fairy-tale it is more than enough."
,Recommended,286320,33103106,Posted: 1 July,all,GrizzGarner,"While this game may have a few sligh flaws (which may just be preference anyhow) I would say that it was fairly well designed, and captivating until the end.The art style is very unique and well drawn, though I did find myself yearning for a bit more color and variation somehow... The game is trying to invoke a rustic, old and somewhat dreary look, and it succeeds in doing this...however, a little more color might have been a nice addition.I found the lore and mythos of the world in Oknytt to be especially interesting, and the voice actor (whom I believe portrays all the voices in the game) does a very good job of emoting and providing enough soul to each character... I do have a minor gripe with the main character's voice, who is obnoxiously meek and apologetic, on the verge of sounding kind of saccharine...I understand this is to help portray the character as being a small, weak creature, but still...something about the main character's voice kind of bothered me.Most of the puzzles and problem solving is fun, save for a few puzzles which seemed a little too abstract to really feel like ""problem solving"". Aside from these few subjective gripes, I would definitely say that this is a game worth checking out if you're into point and click adventures and have an interest in Norse lore and other cultures.It's not a perfect game, but it's certainly a good game, and I feel like I got my moneys worth.I would play it again, and if you've got a few dollars to spend and want to try a relaxing (albiet, kinda gloomy) game with an interesting world and cast, I would suggest that you give Okyntt a go.Graphics - 7/10Sound - 8/10Controls - 10/10Gameplay - 7/10Story - 10/10Total - 7/10."

Thanks to solid gameplay, an intriguing world, and interesting characters, the game is not only competent but also unique.The Good:- Atmospheric dark visuals.- Good ambient soundtrack.- Interesting characters based on Swedish folklore.- Well-paced story with a conclusive ending.- Good voice acting for the narrator.The Bad:- Designed for low resolution (1024x768) and 4:3 aspect ratio.- Animation is lacking in both quality and quantity, making the environments look rather static.- Only one voice actor for all characters, which makes some of them sound just a bit silly.

,Recommended,286320,32946016,Posted: 28 June,all,Criwall,"This is a very nice little point and click adventure. Got ot on a whim because it's based on nordic folklore and was dirt cheep (seriously 0.49€ right now is a steal, It is quite possibly the best game you can get for < 0.5€ right now). And I'm really happy I did, the mood, aesthetics and music comes together to a really nice experience. The puzzles are for the most part pretty straight forward (with a few excptions) and the creatures you speak to usually tell you what they want or you will find contextal clues that will help you understand what you need to do, even if you don't know how to do it. It's not that long, took me around 7 hours to finish and was never really stuck for long periods of time, but well worth the time.+*A few really good puzzles that are not basic ""use object X on Y"".* The atmosphere is fantastic* The artwork is great, clearly inspired by John Bauer (swedish painter and illustrator)* The music is stellar* The use of the 4 runes to have various effects on each area was a pretty novel idea.-*I do think the narrator, while overall great, got a little anoying with some of the voices he makes and the pronounciation of the various creature names is pretty bad. This is probably the only game ever that I kind of wanted a Swedish voice as a option.* The usual point and click problems by mashing together random objects to make a new one is pressent in a few puzzles.Conclusion.If you find it as cheep as it is right now, go for it even if you don't think you like point and click adventures that much. The mood and setting for the game might win you over. But even at the regular price it's still a solid recomendation."

On the journey, encounter and learn about other mythological creatures of Sweden, and explore the darkness as it comes to life in ways rarely seen. All of this, ultimately, is a campfire story, but a beautiful one at that.The puzzles in this game, while not always intuitive, have a certain logic to them that makes sense. With the elemental runes of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire affecting every scene differently, some really interesting puzzles and solutions develop, along with some cute visuals and the more traditional inventory interaction system. And, if you really like storytelling, every interactable piece has an option to hear more narration, as well as the character's speech or just interacting with it.I spent many hours contemplating what I experienced after finishing this game. It has a touching story and an art style I don't see often in games that I found quite pleasing, and the narrator does a great job at setting the tone.If you like point and click puzzle adventures and campfire stories about mythology, then definitely pick this game up.

No fault of the developers, merely my fault for not doing my research.This game is a point-and-click adventure set in a Norse / Swedish folklore-based setting.  As far as mechanics go there are no failstates, and a small level of pixelhunting.  Some of the puzzles felt a little difficult in riddle and could not be easily brute forced, leading to some frustration.  The game's interface worked well enough, and I didnt encounter any bugs, and ran without much problem on my rig (2.8ghz *6 / HD6850 / 8gb).The game's setting is fairly well done, with all environments being presented in a way that nicely emphasizes the night-themed setting.  There is voice acting, but only by a narrator who reads all script and dialogue himself.  This unfortunately means that if you don't like his voice you're kinda stuck for the whole game, and I didn't find myself liking his voice for the main character creature that much.  Because the story is read as a script, you also have to deal with a lot of '...the (NAME) said' and 'the (NAME) (VERB)ed' being read to you, as these actions aren't depicted on screeen due to the drawn-image style of the game.  This kind of draws the scenes out a lot since I read much faster than the narrator speaks, so I often ended up listening to a line or two of character dialogue read before skipping the rest for the next dialogue box.The story is sort of adventurous and ultimately not very weighty or cohesive but that also sort of fits into the lore of the game.  A lot of the characters aren't really drawn in an aesthetic I like but that comes with the setting too I suppose.Overall neither banal nor a masterpiece, about 5 hour length and I didn't feel like my time went to wasted.  If you like point and clicks and interesting settings its certainly worth a go."

,Recommended,286320,29658637,Posted: 2 February,all,KurganNazzir,"*Art-Really well done and sets the atmosphere of the game so well. The little cutscenes looked pretty low-res to me, which was disappointing considering everything else looked so good, but the overall artwork looks great to me and the cutscenes aren't a huge part of the gameplay. When you launch the game, it lets you choose 16-bit or 32-bit graphics; I was using 32-bit. If the game is too dark for you, there is a gamma option in the settings menu once you're in-game.*Music-Overall, the music is very pleasant to listen to and I did not find it overwhelming nor too repetitive. There was one background sound that played in a couple of locations that got really annoying to me and detracted a little bit from the gameplay but not enough to make me dislike the game. At some point, I had turned the ambient sounds down a little bit but I don't recall if that helped with the annoying sound any; probably needed to turn it down more but it was my first play-through and I wanted to experience everything, which includes the background noises that add to the atmosphere (rain, thunder, crickets, etc.), so I didn't want it too low. You can adjust the volume of the music, the voice over, and the ambient sounds in the settings menu.*VO-For the most part, I enjoyed listening to Brian Hall narrate; his voice just lends itself to storytelling and that is what this game is, someone telling a story. There were a few times that his voice got annoying as he was doing specific characters, but overall he did quite well (even if he didn't properly pronounce the Swedish words, according to others).*Story-I found the story to be interesting, although I'm confused as to what the creature, the main character, was exactly. Then again, I don't know if the creature was meant to be anything specific or not. Some of the creatures were already familiar to me, although I don't think I had heard their Swedish names before so I got to learn while playing. The ending was a surprise to me, I don't know why because I know it was hinted at, but I was not expecting that to happen to the little creature. There is a lorebook that fills itself in as you meet the other creatures and as you come across certain objects; you can get to the lorebook via the game menu [ESC] and, once there, you can read about the creatures/objects and you can also listen to Brain Hall read the descriptions.*Gameplay-Overall, I found the game to be fun. I got frustrated a few times trying to figure out what items I needed to combine or what I needed to give to who, but that could have been due to me being tired so I wasn't thinking as clearly rather than having to do with the game itself. I came across an old review on a website where the writer said the game doesn't give you any hints, but it does; almost everything is a hint so you just have to pay attention and think. After completing the parts I struggled with, most of them were ""duh, I should have known that"" moments; although a few weren't as obvious (make sure you play with the runes at the bottom of the screen, after interacting with all of the objects in the scene). Dealing with the Hag is probably the more obscure puzzle of the whole game, at least I think it was for me. The game has several save slots, and no auto-save so make sure you save every so often by opening the menu and clicking save.In conclusion: I thought the game was really well done, I had fun playing it, and I have absolutely no regrets buying it. I'm not the greatest at putting my thoughts into words so I hope this review wasn't too horrible to read."

Along the way you'll run into a wingless alva and you make the promise to help her find her wings. The game plays out like a simple point and click adventure set through five chapters. In each chapter you are given a set list of objectives to complete in order to continue on to the next. With its beautiful animations and wonderful characters the world changes depending on what task you complete, for example in one chapter areas became closed off as i was being surrounded by toadstools. Also on the bottom are four runes which control the four basic elements, these can sometimes provide simple animation fun or be very critical in moving on to the next chapter. The story is well written and although the ending is a little sad at the ame time its a happy ending. Overall Oknytt is definetly one of the best point and click adventure I've played so far.

,Recommended,286320,9813185,"Posted: 13 April, 2014",all,MashPotato,"Oknytt is a lovely point-and-click adventure game in which you play a small creature trying to fine help for his friend, a wingless alva (a fairly-like being). Along the way, the two of you encounter many creatures from Swedish folklore, ranging from the dark and dangerous to the gentle and friendly.I love fairytales and folklore, and I have to say this game really nailed the feeling of being told a story. Much credit for this goes to the writing and the voicework done by the narrator, but is also due to smaller details in the game design.  For example, instead of the standard adventure response ""that won't work"" when you try something, the narrator says ""no, that's not what happened.""  It's a story, and if you try something that makes sense and it doesn't work, it's not that you're wrong, it's simply not what happened.  On the other hand, the game does use fairy tale logic in its puzzle design. To explain: while the puzzles themselves make sense, the reason *why* you're doing them are not always clear.  Like a hero in a fairy tale, just help out the creatures and rest assured that you will be helped out in turn, or at least advance the story.Gameplay is adventure-standard, with cursors to examine, interact, and speak.  Interestingly, if the object cannot be spoken to, the player character instead makes a comment about the object from its point of view, while the examine acts more as an objective description. In addition to the standard controls are runes at the bottom of the screen, which cause the environment to change in some way.  Note that the character does not change the environment with the runes, but rather you're changing the setting around the character.  Both of these design choices add to the feeling of storytelling.Some miscellany: The art is a little sketchy in places, but it does capture the feeling of old paintings one might find in a book. It's a bit on the dark side, but play in a darkish room (which is fitting anyway) and you'll be alright.  The narrator was great, and changed his voice for the different characters (as all good storytellers should!). The player walks incredibly slowly, but make use of double-clicking to travel between areas and this becomes only a minor quibble.  The game took me about 6 hours to complete, so it's not very long, but not short either.Parents: the game is appropriate for older children (minimal violence, no bad language), but just be aware that some of the creatures from folklore sometimes have darkish characteristics (eg. leading travellers astray, etc.) and some have visual designs that may be frightening to some children.If you've read this far, you should know by now whether this game is for you.  I hope it is!"

Sometimes, it deposits little droplets of genuinely eerie instances that the game presents as pedestrian, but will creep you the hell out. Always set against an oppressive backdrop of sheer gloom, distorted faces with blank white pupils will appear at holes in the wall before chatting to you cheerfully. Farm a few items from a nearby scarecrow and its solitary eye will light up and watch you intensely as you harvest straw from the gaping wound you created in its head...  Okyntt’s not tainted by cliché jump scares, by pop-culture nuances or by a development team trying too hard; it’s a casual application of the darker side of Swedish folklore simply allowed to exits on its own merits. I’m just not convinced it’s really a very good adventure game.There are moments in Okyntt that make sense - or, at least, that special kind of sense inventory puzzles start to make after a while. A grumpy household deity lives beneath the creaky floorboards of a farmhouse, ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how someone stole his hat and how he’s hungry. So you make him something to eat and you plop something on his head. The guardian of the farmyard complains how the disrepair of his tools is setting him back – so you find some way to improve his tools. The means are purposefully blurred, but when you have a clear objective in sight, you know you’re working towards something specific. Too many times in Okyntt, you’re going through the motions in the hope that things will start making sense by the end.Full Review //http://www.honestgamers.com/12254/pc/okyntt/review.html"

I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys these games on a more casual level. Best of all, there's no way to fail, so no matter how frustrated you get, you know that you'll never have to reload or start over.The haunting melodies and art really pack quite a punch, the story is simple but captivating and a bit sad, the elder little creatures who populate the world all have their own selfish personalities, and the unique mechanic of being able to manipulate the elements in each room. Amazingly, everyone is voice acted by one dude, yet they're all easy to tell apart, and everything is narrated. The many item puzzles are certainly challenging, but contained in small areas, so thankfully no sprawling worlds to backtrack through; the few logic puzzles are fairly simple.That said, some problems are pretty glaring. The dull color scheme and busy backgrounds really leads to difficulty finding usable objects, so most screens become a game of mouse hunting, while many puzzles (especially early on) make very little logical sense, and can often only be solved by trial and error. Later in the game, they start to make more sense, and the journal gives more hints, too. I only touched a walkthrough once or twice in the second half.The voice actor was wonderful for the various characters, but so dull and overly slow for narration. I honestly would have enjoyed the voice acting more if the narration parts of conversations had been skipped, or better yet animated. Lastly, the creature is just so plodding! It's frustrating walking from place to place trying hunches when he barely moves in the first place.I'd gladly play again for the atmosphere.

,Recommended,286320,10314485,"Posted: 1 June, 2014",all,Altered_Confusion,"I recently decided to look through Steam and try to find a game that I knew nothing about and I found this game, Oknytt. First off I have no idea how to even pronounce the name of the game, but it looked interesting. You are going to play the part of a small creature who rises basically out of a grave and does not know who they are or where they are supposed to go. You will have to journey through 5 chapters of story to come to the end, but on the way you will meet all kinds of beings, some so arrogant that you can't stand it, others trying to be so helpful but at a loss on how they can help.Graphically this game felt dreary, but that's what it was supposed to feel like. I don't want to say it had a grainy film feel to it, but it was pretty close to it. The majority of the characters that you are going to be dealing with in the game look like they came from deep within the earth, and a bit out of nightmares. Actually they have a dark Jim Henson feel to them. Your character looks like a a furry, fat mouse, with not tail, with an anteater's nose.The music in the game definitely fit right with the look of the game, there was something old about it, not that it felt dated, but it felt like you were going back into an age long forgotten in mythology. The voice acting was interesting as this entire game is told as if it was a story around a campfire. So all the voices were done by one person, but you could see that they were struggling with the amount of different voices they had to do and sometimes the unvoiced pieces had different tones and voices to it.The controls are really straight forward you are going to use the mouse for this game, but I want to tell you one thing, which it took me a bit to remember every time that I fired up the game. Any object that you want to interact with you have to hold down the left mouse button and select an action from the wheel. There are no default actions for interactive objects. All you will do is walk over to them. You'll also find that the right mouse button will open up your inventory, but try not to click on an item and then right click again. It will close the inventory, but it will also get rid of the item that you had selected. You will have to mouse out of the inventory box and wait half a second, the box will disappear on its own.So lets get right down to it, this is basically an interactive story about a creature trying to find its place in the world. The unique thing about this experience is that almost where ever you go you will need to remember to check the area out with the different elemental stones that you have at your disposal. Don't worry you're not going to run out of charges, but don't expect something different if you try to do fire over and over again. As I stated before you are going to go through 5 chapters in this game, and you're going to have a story that sometimes might confuse, and at other times you can kind of guess where it is going. If there is a very important task you have to undertake it will be written to the scroll in the upper left hand side of the screen. It's not much but at least if gives you an idea of what is needed to get through the area. Now one thing you need to know about this game is that its not a violent game, so if you're looking for blood and guts, this is not the game for you, but you'll probably guess that within a couple minutes of playing the game simply because of the pace, and the speed in which the character moves across the screen, in one word pedestrian.There are many parts of the game where you're going to be doing a far amount of going back and forth through a specific chapter, but rest assure that most items that you will pick up will be used in that chapter. Now of course there are a couple of exceptions, though you won't know what they are until you advance the story and they are still in your inventory. There will be times where you will have to combine items to make the item you ultimately need to complete a task. Sometimes the things that go together don't make immediate sense but once you put everything together you'll see that it makes perfect sense. The last thing I have to tell you is that there are times where you need to walk to a specific area on the screen to trigger an event, if you are truly stuck in a chapter start walking all over each section and see if it doesn't trigger a change, or if a cut-scene doesn't start.Alright so it comes down to this, would I recommend this game. Well to answer that question I would say that if you're looking for an interesting, very laid-back paced game that is a point and click adventure in which you are really just going through the steps of a story, though there is a couple of things you can change the order of, then this is the game for you. If you are looking for something fast paced, this is DEFINITELY not the game for you, you'll be pulling your hair out probably 2 minutes into the game. So in the end, I have to say as frustrating as it was sometimes thinking outside the box for items to combine or to find something to advance the story, I liked the game so I've got to give it an 8.2 out of 10."

Most can be solved with mild brute force. But there are also some of these ""move all plates to the correct position"" puzzles which are a bit annoying: you only get vague hints about the solutions and there is no easy way to try out your ideas since it always comes with some kind of sliding puzzle mechanism. Especially the last puzzle came as an uncanny combination of vagueness, obscure symbols and sliding puzzle mechanism. Well, that's what walkthroughs are there for. ;)- While the narrator did a great job overall, some of the voices he imitates make you cringe.As a hint: if you want to interact with an object you have to keep the left mouse button pressed down. For some reason I had difficulties to figure that out."

The plot isn't anything remarkable, but it's an enjoyable romp through a marvelously stylized realization of Swedish folklore. Straightforward puzzles with an interesting elements mechanic and impressive visuals/music keep the momentum going throughout.Some of the VA drags a little in spots, particularly in the final chapter, and not every puzzle is laid out in a satisfying way, but these are nitpicks in the grand scheme.Runs about 5-8 hours, so good for an evening play with a friend or your kids. Pick it up full price if you're a fan of story-games. If it's on-sale at all, absolutely worth picking up for anyone."
