It's virtually an underwater version of minecraft, with rebuilding your sub as endgame. No sandbox mode, just 3 slightly different versions of a survival mode. I rarely see anyone with more than 10 hours of gameplay because really there's only about 5 in this before you have nothing left to do, with no real wish for a replay.Personally, I suggest Subnautica for those interested in this, as it has regular updates and dev's that care."

Fantabulous,"I really want to recommend this game.It has a really cool premise and it is pretty well realised.The problem is that it is short as all hell. Unlike other ""Minecraft-like"" games out there this really does have a hard end point to it. Your objective is to collect all the pieces of your sub so that you can get back to the surface(which doesn't make sense but whatever VIDEO GAMES!) and once you have them all that is pretty much it.You do unlock a sandbox mode but in playing the main game you will see everything the game has to offer. With the lack of mods and the Developer stating that they will not be adding any more content it is kinda hard to recommend.It also has one of the worse save functions around. To save you have to quit out of your game completely. That would only be mildly annoying if the game didn't have a nasty habit of crashing to desktop. I stopped playing the game for a week after the game crashed as soon as I found the final piece of the sub. Losing me near to an hour of gameplay.So in summation+Cool Premise+Nice Graphics+Nice Atmosphere-Very Short-No future support-terrible save function-Crashes alot"

The object is to survive below water and reconstruct your submarine to get yourself back to the surface.This game does offer a sandbox version to it, which has its limit of replayability.  You can play this game in 3 modes, adventurer, which is how everyone starts off (allows death and respawning). Survival mode where you have just one life and submarine pieces are harder to locate and sandbox mode which in some part requires you have played a few games in the first 2 modes to be able to play sandbox mode.The game offers a grand total 8 predators that you can fight and kill in the game and 3 of the 8 are sharks, so really 6 different predators if you count sharks as one type.  AGAIN, this is an abandoned early access game thus why variety in predators is lacking.  Also, you have a grand total of 3 tools, also because it was abandoned.  This game has only 5 ores you can mine (not including crystals) to use in crafting...again lack of depth due to abandonment by developers.I have put many hours of game time into this game, most of which was done in early access hoping this game would get better and have more depth added to it, but like many other I was sorely misled that this game would become as great as its developers claimed it would be.This game is absolutely fun to play, but can be played and won within 2-3 hours of game time. I still play this game often to see if I can beat it faster than the time before.  However, this makes the current asking price of $15 USD a ridiculous amount to ask for 2-3 hours of game play.  I DO RECOMMEND this game, as it IS GREAT to play!!!  But do not buy this game unless it is on sale at 33% off OR MORE.I struggled long and hard whether this game would get a thumbs up or thumbs down and I have to give it thumbs down as it is an abandoned game by its developers and it is criminally over priced for what it offers.  I do recommend buying it ONLY if it is on sale."

The gameplay was simple, move the dolphin from the beginning of the stage to the end of the stage, avoiding or destroying obstacles in your path. But, it wasn't the gameplay that intrigued me the most about the game, it was the ambience - the sheer joy of being able to immerse myself within the superior graphics (of the time) and excellently composed music to create what felt to me the ideal oceanic environment. I still have the soundtrack on MP3, for when I wish to isolate myself within once again.When I purchased this game, I had high hopes that it would create a new dream of ambience, despite all of the negative reviews that I had perused, the simple gameplay mechanic really wasn't what I desired the most - in fact, it falls extremely short in depth of every other sandbox game that I have ever played. Yet, I was extremely disappointed after playing this game to realize that all of the potential for beauty that was promised was nothing more than an illusion designed simply to entice dreamers like us to waste our money on a poorly crafted attempt to make quick cash.The music was engaging, until it became repetitive. The graphics were good, until I realized there was no way to interact. The extremely limited availability and flexibility of creation components destroys the ""sandbox"" quality of the game. The overly simplified equipment upgrade mechanics destroy the gameplay. The collision detection is broken. The interlude and story sequences are poorly written. There is absolutely nothing about this game that I can honestly compliment other than the fact that it had wonderful potential if the developers had not given up on it so early, but even then I just can't bring myself to admire those who choose to be lazy. I will *not* be purchasing another game from this developer ever again.I do not recommend purchasing this game based purely on disappointment that I have suffered, the empty promises, and poor overall quality of something that should have been a wonderous achievement."

After a bit though, I had finished and waited for the next update. Only, there was no next update. I had heard there might be more added, but since the devs now claim this is the full game, I feel ripped off. It looked like more was going to be added on with more depths that we can go to, but that never happened. Quite frankly, this is not what invested 15 bucks in and this 'finished game' is definitely not finished. Yes it's a fun game, but when you're expecting more and more updates to come out, to find out that they no longer update it, that's a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥off. There are a lot better games to invest 15 bucks in, Terraria is cheaper and has a way larger amount of content. So rather than give these devs who just dropped the game and said 'it's finished', go give your money to devs who actually still do update their games with new content, even after it's supposedly finished.It's really sad.

I've bought it in a moment of passion, I liked it visual style and its basic gameplay features.

But things turned out, the game was soon ""released"" with the same 2 hours-long (not a joke) playthough and the game is NOT offering anything else apart from the very basic stuff you can find in almost every ""survival"" game. Moreover, the devs now at forums are claiming that the game was NEVER on Early Access and these 2 hours was an intended and finished state for this price.

It is also essentially a tech demo.I cannot recommend it, mostly because there isn't much to it. There's no story to follow, the environment doesn't invite exploration, and the combat is unchallenging (although I appreciate the fact that it can be avoided almost completely). None of these is obligatory - if the game had just one strong feature, it would be enough. Sadly, it has none. The game's mood lasted for about ten minutes.There is no interesting activity involved in finding resources, mining, or crafting - these systems exist in the game in a bare bones, token form. Base construction is essentially pointless: you may need to expand a bit in order to make room for crops, but that's it. You don't get to build anything pretty or impressive. Exploration is minimal: there are three ""depth levels"", each with its own look, but there's no constant re-discovery, like in games that actually manage to generate interesting landscapes. Everything looks the same here, and there's no storytelling through decorations. Pacing is non-existent, save for increased danger during the night. The winning strategy is to hide in the base until sunrise, which means you spend a few minutes doing nothing (you cannot ""go to sleep"" and jump forward).Unless you're specifically interested in performing a series of simplistic tasks in an underwater setting without thinking about it too much, this game has nothing to offer."

Here are my thoughts.Since FarSky is tagged as ""survival"", ""adventure"", ""indie"", ""sandbox"", and ""crafting"", I'm obligated to compare and contrast it with Minecraft, which I also have played extensively. This game is not Minecraft. Its crafting system is much simpler. It has a goal, whereas Minecraft does not. It has an end; you can ""win"". The randomly generated world, while being large and immersive, is finite. The movement mechanics are much different as you're under water. The terrain cannot be deconstructed, but minerals can be mined from it.The graphics are relatively simple, yet work quite well. All the plants and animals under the sea have convincing movements. The enviroment itself is very well done, between the day/night cycles, and the way it fades into a blue haze at a distance.The game mechanics were fun. I could get around without any trouble. The combat system is not overly complex. It can be difficult, especially at night in the first days of the Survival mode, but becomes effortless later on.The premise is that your submarine broke into 9 pieces during a dive, and you are marooned on the bottom of the ocean floor. You must survive, equip yourself, and find the 9 pieces of your submarine. Once you do, it will assemble, and you can ascend to the surface, thereby winning the game. The game itself is relatively short. I have been everywhere, done everything, and beat it 3 times, for a total of 25 hours."

As you can see I didn't spend much time on it, I found it decent at best.From what I remembered the game wasn't bad... But wasn't great? I didn't bother posting an 'actual' review for many reasons; the developers abandoned the game, updating has halted for quite some years now, but the game's not really that old, just old enough to find it suprising that people are searching for actual reviews. You'd think that Subnautica's shadow completely engulfed Farsky as a whole. I definitely agree on the whole different experiences argument, but if you look passed that, Subnautica and Farsky are quite similar. All I was trying to say was if you're looking for an underwater adventure sandbox-esque game I'd suggest buying Subnautica, as it's much more polished and updated regularly. So I guess as a whole Farsky can be fun, it's short, there are much better alternatives, but if Subnautica's premise doesn't rub you the right way, Farsky would be the next best thing.)so there you have it, an actual review based solely on vague memories of when i played farsky for a whopping hour, i still don't recommend it unless you really dont like subnautica kthx"

This game had a great premise and all the foundation of something that could be really good. Visually, it's not the most impressive thing in the world, but it did have its own flair that could stand on its own. The gameplay elements that are there are pretty engaging too. But that's about where the good ends.I'm not one of those people who needs a game to have a billion hours worth of content. I much prefer a tight game that tells its story and moves on. Unfortunately, there is a limit to that. This game has, at best, a couple hours of playtime- anything more than that is just people desperately hoping to find something extra where nothing exists. While the $9.99 price point is commensurate with, say, a movie of the same run-time, it still feels like being overcharged for something incomplete.The story was not memorable (I literally have no idea what it was anymore- something about crashing and having to find parts again). The gameplay was enjoyable for a while, but certainly not enough to sustain a sandbox mode. I didn't feel like the experience added anything to my life. There was no emotional impact, no real story, and no meaningful journey to speak of, which is an absolute requirement if you're going to make a game that's this short.

There are a lot of pretty lights and the creature designs get very creative.The story is that you crash a submarine and it breaks to pieces and you have to put it back together. That is all there is to it. I may have missed something, but it did not explain who I am, or who the person is guiding me through this survival disaster. There is no putting the submarine together, it just happens. There are bases scattered in various areas with little explanation and it actually defeats the purpose of building your own base, which is a big part of sandbox games. The point of building the sub is not so you can continue whatever mission you had to complete, which would have made the game very interesting, but so you can float to the surface and be rescued. (none of this is a spoiler because the whole story is literally handed to you in the first 5 mins of the game). If you just build a water scooter, you can swim up to the surface but it blocks you with an invisible wall at 30m which just killed the immersion, and explains why building the sub to complete your mission is a much more intersting story prospect.Depth of gameplayThere jus isnt much to it. I will compare it to minecraft for this one. In minecraft, you make your own story because there is none. You mine resources for armor and weapons because they always break. You build multiple homes in different locations because it is beneficial. This game has none of that. You make an armor piece and you respwn with it when you die. When you die, you don't reload. You just magically reapear in your first base. All your droped loot is marked on the map and stored for easy access when you go back to it. It is really hard to get into this game because it honestly felt like the game was rushing me to beat it.This game actually had a very good sound track. It was very ambient and soothing. The suspenseful sound track that plays when you attack a certain preditor is okay, but the ambient music more than makes up for it. My only complaint is that it didn't play enough in game. And the game only took about 2 hours to beat and I was taking my time with it, so if it played the same ambient track on a loop, I would not have gotten tired.This game is not hard at all. I feel like survivor mode (unlocked by beating normal mode) would be kind of hard because there are more preditors, the sub parts arent marked on the map, and you only get one life. I'd try it but honestly, I'd either die and move on, or reach a point and get bored from always having to roam the ocean floor in a grid trying to find these parts, which even though they are engulfed in giant obvious glowing lights, only become visible when you get close.Overall I can't recommend it for the above reasons as well as two other reasons. One is that it is not worth $14.99 USD and the other is that the dev gave up on it already. Even though people still buy this game, the developer got lazy and the odds of another update, more content, or even just paid DLC are probably zero.

Maybe add a difficulty setting other than spawn control in only the sandbox mode?-I never used late game equiptment at all, it's not even needed to dive to the deepest part of the ocean and win the game.-Once you get to the deeper parts of the ocean, the noise starts getting all buggy and you can't hear enemies anymore as well as other sounds that should be there.-There is virtually no late game. The bottom of the ocean is actually easier to survive in than the shallow area you start in. the late game boss enemies don't even attack until provoked.-While there are some cool things you can do with building, a small two room base will do you just as good as a massive fancy base.**and finally my biggest problem with this game**-During adventure mode you earn money to use in the sand box mode for free play. Okay, awesome. However you can only use this money ONCE, for ONE sand box game! After completing the adventure mode and Survival mode with gathering as much money as possible I started a sand box game with everything I wanted :) And then I tried starting another sandbox game, with no money to actually start with anything... So to play sand box and actually have enough money to start with the fun items you have to spend hours in the regular game -_- each time...So....There are a lot of things I find annoying with the game play. But you know what? I still enjoyed my time playing this game. It just doesn't feel finished. It feels like this game is still in production."

,Not Recommended,286340,23353223,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,TheGreenJacket,"First off, let me begin by saying that I have a deep seated fear of the ocean. Even games like this terrify me. I also love being scared. Not that this is a horror game, mind you. This game terrified me, in a good way. I enjoyed playing it at first. However, as I began to get used to the game and discovered my objective, I began to become less and less satisfied. Overall, it has the feel of a game that is unfinished.The premise of the game is this: You are a deep sea diver who's submarine has crashed in the middle of the ocean. Your objective is to find all nine pieces of your submarine and return to the surface. Pretty interesting, at least to me. It took me two days to complete the game. Even with the randomly generated map, I am confident that it would take me only two hours at the most to finish the game again, now that I am aware of what I am doing. Some might pose the question, ""Well why don't you take time to enjoy the building and gathering of resources."" The game offers no point in doing so. You can build various items, from diving gear to tables and stools. However, this is extremely limited. There are literally two decorative furniture items for indoors. There isn't much else. There's no point in using the chair and stool for asthetic when you can't even create other things. You can make a lamp and a door. Add some glass walls, etc. But that is it. It really lessens the use of the resources. You don't need a bigger house, because there is nothing to put in it. The most I began using the resources for in the end were for ammunition. *SPOILER* I didn't even build the supercharged drill or whatever the name of the device was. There was no point. I cannot stress enough how little there was to do. And collecting the submarine pieces may seem like a bit of a challenge, but the map literally tells you where they all are.When the download began, it only took about three minutes, so I didn't expect much in terms of graphics. But when I entered the game I was surprised. It was beautiful. It was so calm and serene to watch the manta rays swimming above me, to hear the whales echoing in the distance, and terrifying to watch the tail of a shark jet out into the fog. There was a handful of different creatures for me to meet, and feast upon, and it all moved so beautifully. The simplicity of the graphics simply seemed to credit the beauty. That's why I am so disappointed in everything else. I really wish they had worked a little harder on this. From what I recall there was quite a bit of hype when this game first appeared, but it seems the creator just shelled this out in all the excitement. Overall, I wouldn't reccomend it for the price it is at. It'd probably be a good game for children to play as, for them, it would be a bit more complicated and hard.Otherwise, don't get it.Fun 3/5, Originality 2/5, Graphics 4/5, Maturity 3/5, Worth the price? 2/5 (I give a two instead of a one due to the quick download and interesting graphics)"

After the 2 hour mark I was bored due to the fact there is absolutely nothing else to do, so I started shooting krakens until I died. I would recommend this game if you want 2 hours of fun, beyond that... I would save your money and look towards a game where the developers actively update/patch and deploy new content.Maybe this game is at it's ""full version"", but it felt like a cheap grab at money for another game."

In two to three hours you'll see everything there is to see and by the end you can reallly feel the point at which the Dev must have thrown their hands in the air and walked away.  There is no real reason to build another base.  There's barely even any reason to expand the base.  I invested some time into expanding to include a storage room and extended hallways between two of my initial harvesting spots, only to realize some time later that the second-tier resources and gear would have only taken minutes to find past getting the first round of equipment, the third just barely past that.  You'll be tasked with finding the 9 pieces of your broken submarine if you play adventure or survivor mode, and that is where you'll spend three hours scavenging to get yourself to the surface.  In sandbox mode you'll still build and see everything in those few hours, but with the goal removed and the option to buy starting items with mysterious boxes of gold coins that show up in Adventure and Survival.There's a lot of potential here, and it reminds me of Minecraft in alpha, but that's not a compliment for a finished game.  It isn't especiallly pretty, and the uninspired, low-res graphics don't get anywhere close to earning the title of stylized.  It's just... bland.  The graphics are bland, the gameplay is bland, the crafting is bland.  There's so little meat to this game and whats available is barely palatable.

It's lovely, the gameplay is fairly smooth, and the ever-present battle against the air tank adds a little suspense, particularly before any upgrades are peformed.However, the game plays like a beta - there is very little content or diversity. I love a good survival/hoarding game, and this should fit the bill perfectly; however, the extremely limited crafting and resources are disappointing.When I purchased this, I thought it was a beta, and I continued to think that until I sat down to write this review and saw the others. It's very sad the devs are done with the game, as it could have a lot more added to it.Things I like:* Novel concept and storyline (thought it's far too short)* Beautiful, rich, underwater environment* Automated defenses, like drones and turrets* Extra cargo space with drones* Exploration which requires upgrades to complete (though it can all be seen and done within a couple of hours)* Increased danger from predators at night* Upgradable equipment* Automated resource extraction* Decent hunger/food system* Blood mechanics (blood in the water from injuries or hunting attracts predators)* Music and sound effects* Decent world topographical map showing major points of interest/resources* Decent agricultural system (but it would benefit from more options)Things I dislike:* Terrible gravity system - I understand we can't just have the ability to limitlessly ascend, but the current system is infuriatingly limited.* Limited crafting - number of possible objects/upgrades is very small.* Limited construction - More base options would be nice.* Storage chests are far too small and non-stackable.* No way to recover items after death - at least none I've found.* No way to sleep through the night to fast-forward* No way to split stacks in inventory at all - at least none I've found.* Some items are ridiculously expensive to craft/consume for the reward.* No ability to save the game without quitting.What I would like to see:* More diverse predators* More storyline* More biomes to explore* More craftable items* More and better base construction* More discoverable points of interest - different wrecks, caves, et cetera* More resource types* Less expensive cooking - each item of cooked food takes 1 coal, which can be difficult to findI got this on sale for less than $5, and it was definitely worth that amount. I might even say it's worth the $14.99 if you're the sort of person who doesn't want a seriously challenging game, and are more in the mood to mindlessly (in a pleasant way) gather resources and live out your life on the ocean floor.Still, it could be so much more.

The plot is similar, but execution is a little worse.  If you're into the game for the plot, there isn't much of one, and the singleplayer ""Adventure"" mode is a little short at about 1-2 hours, depending on resource and objective spawns.  The construction and survival elements are actually pretty decent, though, and finding/repairing broken bases and drones was a fun little side-attraction.  I can imagine the game actually becomming a decent time-waster in survival mode, as building expansive bases and automating mining and food production would be good for at least 4-5 hours.The obvious elephant in the room is SubNautica, though.  As it was released at a later date, and has more money behind it, SubNautica has assimilated a lot of the best parts of FarSky, notably in fishing for food, combating hostile wildlife, and salvaging broken technology, but it also expands on these concepts far further, and has a more engaging story and gameplay, not to mention improved visuals and frequent updates.  If you can, I'd reccomend purchasing both games on sale.  FarSky goes on for about 5 dollars somewhat frequently, and I got it for 3 during the winter sale, and SubNautica can be had for 10-15 dollars if you're patient.  If you don't have the funds to get both games, I'd reccomend SubNautica, but if you don't have a great pc(SubNautica chugs pretty hard on decent machines), or are looking for a fun few hours of entertainment, you could do far worse than picking up FarSky on sale!"

Wait until it receives a massive sale, because while the game is enjoyable it is short, linear (despite random levels and sandbox). You harvest a resource to go a little deeper, find some items, and repeat.The visuals are nice and the idea of exploring a randomly generated world seems good at first, but like everything else in the game it is simplified to the extreme. There are three tiers of depth, not a varied seascape, so you are prompted to upgrade to a certain depth, find resources for the next depth, and repeat. Dangerous depths could have been a fantastic mechanic but you essentially start at the top of an underwater mountain and work your way down, and there is no variation from this from new game to new game."

The tech trees look like they were set up so that the player could build a vast number of buildings and weapons. I thought I accidentally bought an early release title, but it appears that the devs just gave up and released the game the way it is.It's a shame really, I think the idea of a minecraftish game in an underwater setting sounded pretty cool. I would like to have seen meaner and tougher enemies as when you dive deeper into the depths of the ocean rather that the slow moving jellyfinsh and friendly squid that only attack when you mess with them. I would have liked to build an underwater base with power generators and defense systems, oxygen tanks starcraft style tech tree stuff.

In FarSky, I had no clue what to do and kept dying alot. But in a good way.FarSky is a fairly simplistic underwater survival game, in which you are tasked with collecting 9 submarine parts to return to the surface. Easy, right? Wrong.You are dropped in an underwater base with nothing but a diving suit and a drill, and you must get to these nine parts by your own means. Collect resources, make better equipment, and delve deeper into the depths of the ocean. FarSky is a really atmosperic game, and with it's easy game mechanics I can easily see myself diving (see wot I did der) into the game's sandbox mode, and just having a good ol' explore of the ocean floor.However, the ocean is no calming retreat. FarSky offers a ""hunt or be hunted"" type deal, in which you need to hunt for your own food, or get eaten by it. It is quite a challenging experience, but after each death I somehow want to go back and fight off the creature and get my dropped supplies.However, when I found out that this was not an early access game, I was a little dissapointed. The game doesn't offer many game mechanics (for exapmle there are very few things you can craft), much like a game in the beta phase would play like. It's vast ocean playground is it's saving grace, because it's lack of content really does let it down.+ The game is quite easy to get into after the first half hour or so+ The ocean is an atomospheric, and scary, place. FarSky shows that perfectly+ Offers a good central goal from the get-go. You don't feel as if you are wandering aimlessly- I would expect this amount of content from an Early Access game, not a full release.- Combat is very shaky. I often died (maybe b/c I suck)- Expanding the base is tricky and not very well done (again, maybe b/c I suck)8/10"

Not much of an issue if you're good at timing your knife swings or spear gun shots, but is still a flawed system for a game.- The uncontrollable Droid AI can get you into trouble if they shoot and miss a smaller predator such as a frilled shark, but hit a kraken...- Certain upgrades/objects are useless like the Overpowered Drill, and the harpoon turret which can actually get predators to attack you even if you just swim by due to hostile creatures' AI.

I bought it on sale for $3, and had played it to comepletion in about 4 hours (give or take an hour I spent just exploring for no reason).As much as I hate to echo everyone else's review, there simply is not enough content to make it worth the original price. It's fun to get to a new level (of which there are currently 3) and explore the flora and fauna, and it's fun to find abandoned bases which you can repurpose for yourself, but that's where the fun ends. The building/crafting is extremely lackluster, the fights are hard to survive, especially when you take into account certain predators which have insane health, and blistering speed. More often than not, your screen will flash red, and you'll spin around to see what attacked you, but more than likely the enemy passed right through you and is now coming at you from the opposite side.The story is pretty weak and straightforward, which really isn't a big deal to me, especially in a crafting game. Your submarine has broken into 9 pieces, which have been scattered across the ocean floor. Find them.The text is pretty iffy in terms of translation. It's usually okay, but there are certain phrases where you know what is being said, but the word they used just doesn't fit right.Glitches. Let's talk about glitches. There are A LOT of them. Plant carrot seeds and get carrots, right? No, silly. Plant carrot seeds and get infinite carrot seeds which in turn can be planted to grow more carrot seeds. Remove window to get window?

The only thing you can build and customize right now is your base, and even so, there isn't much point in doing so, except to allow for more room for chests. The game also tells you what materials you need to craft items, so it's not much of a mystery, and you don't need a wiki to figure it out.Third, gathering materials is very easy. You are given an item that will collect whatever you place it on, for as long as you want it to.

I've finished the game and Steam says I've played for less than an hour. A considerable chunk of that was wrestling with the unintuitive interface and restarting. The survival mechanics are rendered irrelevant by how abundant food is.

It just doesn't have enough length of play, and it's not early-access where you can expect to get more content later.  The developers have decided that this short game is the finished product.You can finish through in about 8 hours of play (or less, depending on skill, but it definitely won't take more than that.  I finished in 4.5 hours first time but that was with constant nonstop play.  If I'd put it down and come back later I suspect it would have taken longer overall as I'd not have kept the player skills as fresh in my head.)It also has a sandboxy survival mode which I haven't tried yet, but the main adventure game is a bit short.Don't get me wrong.  The shortness of play is the only thing about it that's not so great.  Other than the duration, everything else about it is wonderful.  It's defnitely very pretty.  Visually it's great to look at, especially in the late game as you go deeper and see lots of bioluminescent life forms.  It's a bit like minecraft but without the ability to alter the terrain - you just gather things and build stuff to add on top of the terrain, trying to make the necessary equipment to survive the adventure.  (For example you'll have to go down deep to finish, but your starting scuba suit can't go deep enough to get to the lower layers, so you'll have to construct a better scuba suit to be able to finish, as well as making better weaponry to survive the monstrous stuff down deep.)"

The gold for the sandbox version is a good idea, however it should be permanent total, that is increased by collecting more in the story and survival modes. Having to go back into the game and replay to play another sandbox game is just enforcing replayability to get the best out of the game.What I personally would like to see, would be the following:1. Caves that can be explored with air pockets that only give so much air before they disappear.2. A shark frenzy, as in late game gameplay, I found that I spent a fair bit of time hunting sharks for food as opposed to being fearful.3. A possible crafting set up so we can use the materials that we harvest or a crafting guide written somewhere, like what does fertilizer do in game and how do I use it?4. The idea of multiplayer mode would be good, 2-4 player co-op would be good, any more than that and resources might become a little thin.With these things in mind, I would be reluctant to suggest this game to people on the basis that there doesn't really feel very much value for money. Comparing the game to others in the same genre of sandbox/resource gathering/base-building/survival - The other games have a LOT more content and replayability for the same price. If the suggestions that I myself have made and the other players that have written the details in the review section are considered and possibly implemented, then I would definately suggest this game.

Sadly however, the world of the game may be colorful yet it just doesn't beg for me to go and explore the vast ocean and aquantic lives thriving behind it. Which actually, are not even there to the best extent. There also just isn't much to the game and nothing to do to keep me entertained or coming back to it for more. I got this on a major sale, but at the price point of $15 I don't see a reason to spend that much money on a game that just in the end leaves you feeling incomplete. After a couple hours, a couple minutes even. You become bored with nothing left to do and no reason to return to it.Collecting materials in the game are like collecting coins that really go towards nothing and serve no major purpose whats so ever. It's just there for you to grab. No story behind this game. No challenge whats  so ever. While it may be a fun time burner there are many more games in my library for me to turn to while i'm craving a survival sandbox adventure, this game just falls short of giving me that complete feeling and there's just to many competitors in this category for this game to hold a strong back bone.On the plus side, I have had no problems with the gameplay. Runs smoothly and works fine with no bugs or malfunctions. So if it's on sale, I recommend picking it up and giving it a try. Otherwise.

The game itself and its mechanics are pretty fun in the vein of ""minecraft"" you get iron gear to mine copper at the next level then use copper to mine deeper and so forth, but after copper there’s only one more level and then its endgame. I would love to see bigger enemies and the greater depths actually used, dived down past 350 hoping to see a megalodon or something, but nada. Would also love for it to be darker, much much darker at lower depths and at night making use of the lights you can build and making the night and lower depths much more horrifying and dangerous.

In Sandbox mode, specifically, there is a chance that you will find yourself on the only peak at a depth that you can handle, and thus not be able to go deeper to get the resources to build a better suit. There is also a lack of diversity in both the wildlife and the surrounding environment (yeah, it's under the ocean, but it's insanely diverse down there!).On the bright side (I love this game, remember?) building is fun! So is hunting. The underlying systems (hunting or growing food to satiate your hunger, building better suits to go deeper, mining for resources to add to your base or build the items you need) is wonderful and addictive. The music is lovely and, despite the flaws, the environment is both colorful and reactive to your presence.All in all, I would give this an 8 out of 10; a good game, particularly for early access.

So today I played it and I have to say the positives FarOutweigh the negatives.I've only played two hours so far, about an hour and a half in the regular mode and half an hour in sandbox and it has really been an interesting game. The crafting chain is fairly simple and expanding your base is as well. Extractors are extremely useful in speeding up production if it's one of the first things you make.Ladders and cliffs are my main negative notes, getting into base can be tedious and mean death depending if it's nighttime (as I found out when a shark attacked me with very little health b/c of hunger) and I very nearly ragequitted at having to swim back up cliffs. (Having gotten stuck for 10 minutes, and then running out of oxygen)Overall, negative points aside, it is a very interesting game, that I could potentially spend at least a dozen more hours playing. And I definitely recommend it. Definitely money well spent."

Most sandbox games go on forever with no real point to them but there is an ""ultimate goal"" in FarSky: To rebuild your broken submarine and get back to the surface. It's funny to say but that part of the game  reminds me of ToeJam & Earl for the Sega Genesis.There's peaceful music and visuals. Most creatures are passive unless blood is spilled nearby or it's night. Build up your own base or do like I did and take up residence in an abandoned base. After they're repaired and drained of water, they usually become more space than I personally need.The downside is that the game is considered ""finished"" by its developer and if you experience any bugs, you're out of luck on that front. I've run into issues with collision that have made me a bit more careful in how I approach ladders/hillsides but some real tweaks there would have been nice. More than once my swimming drone has gone through the base's walls, leaving trails of bubbles in a room/corridor. It's also a bit irritating that using the underwater scooter doesn't make you fast enough to outrun the deadly night predators that will be gnawing at your flesh if you stay out too late.With so many materials to harvest and such interesting areas to explore, I am a little disappointed that more work won't go into it. There's only basic furniture in the way of workbenches, tables and chairs to decorate your living space. I've found sunken ships half-buried in the sand but there's no way to enter them and they seem to serve no other purpose than decoration/a map marker for treasure chests. The story is also basic and doesn't really give you any true reason of why you went down there in the first place.I do love that you can use extractors to do the mining work for you while you keep exploring, and that they're retrievable so you don't have to keep making them over and over again. Hunger is a persistent mechanic but fortunately you can grow veggies in self-tending gardens--just remember to cook them for the maximum effect. You also get a lot of options for defending yourself: Weapons, drones and harpoon cannons (they're like automated turrets).I got my copy during the 2015 Steam Summer Sale and I recommend waiting for a sale to pick this up. It is fun but since the developer has admitted to having no more interest in its upkeep, a sale is the best way to feel like you got your money's worth out of a potentially short game."

Eğer bilgisayarınızda ekran kartınız veya Java güncel değilse oyun çöker hatta daha baştan açılmaz. (64bit Windows için ayrıca 64bit Java indirmeniz bile gerekebilir) Gerekli linkleri, oyunun topluluk konu başlıkları içerisinde  Yapımcının açtığı sabit bir konuda detaylı bir biçimde bulabilrisiniz.Oyunun kendisine gelecek olursak en kabacasından su altnda basit bir Minecraft olarak düşünebilirsiniz. Daha derinlerde daha değerli madenler vardır, ve o derinliklere inebilmek için dalış kostümünüzü geliştirmeniz gerekir. (Kask, zırh ve dalış tüpü, basit olduğunu söylemiştim) Bu oyunu indirirken aşırı detaylı öyle aman aman birşey beklemeyin, normal ''Aaa bu ne, aaa şu ne.'' diye diye oynasanız bile max 4-5 saate hikaye modunu bitirebileceğiniz bir oyundur, yine de her ne kadar basit olsada, tam bir göz zevkidir, rengarenk minaraller, bitkiler ve mercanlar, sayıları ve çeşitleri az dır, ama birleşince 4 saat oynayıp silebileceğiniz bir oyun için oldukça güzel bir atmosfer oluştururlar. Oyun dediğim gibi su altında geçtiği için Ay'ın yüzeyindeki gibi devasa zıplamalar ile haraket ederek yol alırsınız bu oyunda, ama dikkat edin oksijen tüpü sınırlıdır ve üssünüze dönmeniz gerekir. (Başlangıçta sizlere aktif ve minik bir üs(base) verilir, ancak harita üzerinde onarabileceğiniz çok daha büyükleride vardır, ayrıca kendi üssünüzü inşa edip büyütebilirsiniz.) Sandbox modu da vardır ve adından da anlaşılacağı gibi gez dolaş tarzındadır. Hikaye kısmına gelecek olursak, denizaltınız parçalanır, ve deniz tabanına düşersiniz, göreviniz haritada dağılmış olan 9 denizaltı parçasını toplayıp yeniden yüzeye çıkabilmektir.Not: Arkaplan müzikleri oldukça hoş."

I can only fill my dream base with so many workbenches, i've realized. I completely understand that the game is about surviving and the goal is to escape, but what about after you finally get to? What do you do after you go beyond surviving and start LIVING underwater?

(6) submarine should be harder to craft (personal list of items needed: Harpoon cannon(4), glass(20), gold(30), Manganese(50), iron(100), Iron Oxygen Tank(4) ). (7) More detail on the surface(maybe even a little island or two?) (8) New weapons such as (Underwater pistols, Torpedo cannon, underwater mines, and an underwater rifle just to spice things up. (9) Whale Meat Cooked should give 80% hunger instead of 50% since sharks are much easier to kill and whales are way bigger too. (10) Maybe a bit more fps in the game? It's really laggy because of all the particles so i get 20fps. A little less lag would be awesome! That's my list for the ideas i had for the game. Please Start developing the game even more.

As a diver whos submarine just crashed and its components scattered around a procedurally generated underwater landscape you are to recover the lost components and rebuild said submarine.Before you do, however, you need to find shelter in abandoned seabed stations (and build more, modify, repair or destroy them, they are concidered yours), grow or hunt (or be hunted) for food and mine for minerals. One should also keep an eye on the depth and air meter, as the diving equipment worn is limiting max depth, breathing time, and armor.The sealife is interactive in that it tries to swim away if its frightened by you, ignores you if it doesn't concider you a threat or hunts for you if it does or you are leaking bodily fluids that simply attract predators.One of the even more interesting points is that you will find underwater stations that have been damaged. When you are close enough the engine kicks in and starts flooding these stations. Repairing them will reverse the damage but will cost you some iron. As of yet I have not actually seen a base being damaged, but I suspect that the squids or sharks will pound a station if a hunted player enters them for shelter.As this game is still in active development I have high hopes. The game seems done as is, and is well worth the full price."

But we fixed it. The game is amazing! With things to craft, weapons to fight with, depths to explore, resources to find and drill, and lots of fauna to fight! I know this is one of the few reviews that say this, but FarSky is brutally hard. Once a predator starts to attack you, there's no escape. This only way to evade them is to make them run into something, or go into your base until they go away. The only other thing that I don't like is that unlike Subnautica, you can't freely swim. You have to jump instead of swim. And for some reason there too much gravity underwater. But otherwise, it's a great game! It is short, I beat it in 2 hours.

The game looks fantastic, it plays great, and there is a lot to do. I love the survival parts as building my base. I have always loved the open ocean and the marine life that lives in it, so I hope more will be added in the future. I hope in the future you can explore deeper and deeper into the ocean, and get a lot more ores and items that isnt in the current game.You can do a lot with this game, even though it feels completed already. I want in future updates to have more base mechanics, such as better flooding and doors to stop flooding. I want to see flooding to be more dynamic, and I want to see a  emergency device will replace the flooded base with air, aswell as a device that will convert water to oxygen, and having to fill your oxygen tank with oxygen, to make it more realistic.While I did not encountered that much glitches in the game, I encountered one that stopped me from moving while Im in the Submarine. On Adventure Mode, after completing the game, I went to my base and got out of the Submarine. As I tried to ride it again, it wont move. Thankfully, you dont really need the Submarine anyways, as you still need oxygen to live, although the sub is very usefull.I hope there will be more updates to this game, just like Minecraft is getting updates. A lot of people compare this game to Minecraft in a way, and I think it is true. But FarSky ISNT a Minecraft clone, its a game that took a lot of inspirations from Minecraft and made it its own.

The player then finds a base of operations within the first 3 minutes. At the base the player can craft better diving gear, cook food and build pieces to expand the base. Most of the stuff a player can craft is not very usefull and more for building a personalized base. There are a few items that is neccasary for getting all the pieces. This includes diving helms, bandanges etc. The game is short and my first playthough took me 4 hours and 5 mintes (According to the in game counter). About two hours of that time was spent getting resources and building the base I wanted. After that I focused on getting all the subarine part. The game isn`t difficult and I only died once. The graphics aren`t great, but for me that is just part of the charm.I`d say it worth getting at 50% discount and more.P.S.A lot of people are complaining that the developer moved on and wont update the game anymore (since he sees it as complete). While it is true that there are some missed opertunities, but I didn`t experience any glitches or crashes so I don`t have a problem with the no update situation.

I have been playing crafting/survival games for awhile now am  hooked on the genre. I tend to play horror games a lot also so when they are combined (like in 7 days to die) there is a good formula for a game. But as far as horror games go no amount of zombies or mutilated aliens or jump scares or screaming bloody murder is truly scary. The reason being is that games and movies have been all over those settings for a long time, and they have become a big repetitive. Zombies, aliens, obscene amounts of gore, thats old material.Now, what isn't old material:deep, dark oceans, drowning, massive sea monsters, and whatever that feeling is that everyone had when they were a kid and they swam in the deep end of the swimming pool, afraid somehow there was a massive shark or octopus underneath you.FarSky takes advantage of these fears, and combined with it's unique setting makes for a perfect formula of a game that fulfills the void left by the fact that there has not been any kind of game like it. Deep ocean has got to be the best grounds for a survival game there is. I just finished the game and have got to say it was fun, really fun, especially when I was running (swimming) for my life trying to get into my base before a shark ripped my arm off. And the bone chilling feeling of fragile safety being inside of my base looking out the windows at the dark, scary ocean and seeing hordes of dangerous fish really made me feel immersed in the game. Knowing that a piece of glass was all that protected you from an infinite expanse of your worst childhood nightmares was nice feature, and  Jumping off an undersea cliff really gave me a feeling of adventure. Also it got me immediately thinking about all the horrible sea monsters that could be below me, which got me thinking I need to get back to my base and go back to that feeling of safety that felt so good. I give this game a well deserved 10/10."

The randomly generated map is littered with all kinds of treasures and resources to find, from ship wrecks to veins of gold sticking out of the rock, all of which show up clearly on the minimap.Crafting, in my honest opinion, is a little too simple. Within 10 minutes I had all the crafting stations set up in my tiny starter base, and had already started equipping the next tier of diving gear that allowed me to reach the darker depths of the sea. But thankfully, exploration is limited by the amount of air left for you to breath. While this can be upgraded along with how far below the ocean you can travel and the amount of damage you can resist, the time limit means you need to be careful you don't wander too far from your base. Thankfully additional bases can be build, if you can find the appropriate materials.So far I've only had two issues. The first being that I can't figure out why I can't use bandages. I'd select them in my inventory, click use and nothing will happen. Both inside and outside of my base. The second issue, though I doubt this will be a common problem, was that a shark somehow managed to attack me inside my base while I was doing some quick crafting. Other than that the game runs smoothly on the highest settings without any graphical lag or screen tearing.My only criticism is that there appears to be a lack of things to craft. Outside of weapons, diving gear and additional building parts, the only craftable furniture are tables and stools. I would love to fill my base with more than just crafting stations, storage chests and plant pots."

Problem is this seems to have fallen into abandonment and in the forsaken land of quick money grabs. The system is solid everything is smooth. Sadly once you understand how to play you can get to the end of this system in under 45 minutes, yes, in hardcore survival mode.Depth meter would make you believe you can go a lot deeper but this is limited to 3 explorable layers, arguably I would have liked to see at least 10 explorable layers to consider this a complete experience. As it is right now it is sadly anti-climatic.Yes I understand this is a single dev working on it and no it doesn't mean I should proportionally lower my expectations. Everything was put in place for me to thouroughly enjoy the first 3 layers, adding a bit more depth would have been a small extra step to take and would have meant couple more layers, couple more material dependencies before going down, more crafting, stronger enemies. Hell i wouldn't even mind having the same enemy in different colors and stronger in a WoW type of fashion, I just wanted a bit more. Its an engageing experience and you want to keep playing, but you cant because there is so little content to sink your teeth in.It was fun but did not provide enough.Change my mind, provide follow up and add depth to your game, reasons for me to want to keep playing.When you make a game and dont provide me with a way to keep playing it, to me it falls short of expectations.You needed to make a small extra step forward but you did not, I question why, is it because you're overwhelmed, or lazy, or is this a cash grab ? Why would you be content eating peanuts when you could have gone the extra step that would make you able to afford a peanut plantation ?I'm sorry FarSky Interactive, I really really enjoyed the game it was very engaging experience. I want to keep playing but theres no way for me to. I wanted to give a really positive review but in retrospect, theres no way for me to do that either.I'm sitting here hoping that someday i can come back to it and resume my exploration of the depth with some more engageing content but I feel like all i can expect is some more disappointment.tl:dr : Great system, total immersion.

I made it threw both game modes without a single death, resources are so plentiful that you will never want for anything, and in most cases I beat the game without using the top tier equipment.One concept that I liked was in order to mine one of the more rare resources you had to kill the giant squids that were protecting it. This was itroduced half way threw the game and is a fun miniboss battle. What was dissapointing wasthat the squids are the hardest enemies, and there is no actuall ""boss"" in the game. Being able to kill the stongest enemies with early game equipment is not caracteristic of the Survival game genre.For something that is supposed to be a Survival/Adventure game it feels like an early access game instead of a final product.

But that's pretty much every sandbox game that bothers with a story at all, so not a big deal.The actual area of gameplay, while randomly generated for replayability, is fairly small as such games go, but I like to think of it like the Fallout 4 map: It's smaller, but more densly packed with obstacles, resources to stop for or make trips way out for and of course, various dangers.Not the least of which involves the survival aspects of the game. Making sure you can actually reach and effectively operate in the area you're trying to get to can sometimes require considerable preparation, creating a nice sense of satisfaction as you become able to access new areas etc. and provides a good risk curve that makes you feel trepidation about such undertakings, offering the thrill of exploration and conquest of such dangers.On balance, it's a surprisingly fun and refreshing experience which runs on pretty low-end systems and is, in my opinion, totally worth the money I paid for it. Something I can tinker around in to relax and enjoy without being too invested in any individual playthrough, yet still immersed in the gameplay the whole time I'm playing it.That may or may not make sense to you, but it is nevertheless the kind of feeling the game engenders in me. It is kind of like a thinking player's version of a casual game. The hardcore survival sandox player's version of tasty snack foods. Ultimately unfullfilling, but oh so enjoyable as a palette-cleanser between courses of heartier faire."

If you want, you canread the review in English in our group forum--------------------------------[CAT]Dins del seu gènere, aquest és un joc curt i senzill, però prou ben fet i amb el potencial per evolucionar cap a un joc molt més complet, interessant i sofisticat.La llàstima és que el seu creador ja fa temps que ha passat a centrar-se en un altre joc, però és comprensible. Fins on jo sé, Farsky era un dels seus primers jocs i era un projecte en solitari. Per tant, entenc que no volgués allargar el cicle de vida del seu desenvolupament, per poder dedicar-se a d'altres nous projectes.El joc el pots completar fàcilment en menys de 20 hores i malgrat que es basa en un sistema procedimental de generació de mapes i que incorpora un mode de joc en forma de ""pati de jocs"" (sandbox), no té gaire valor de rejugabilitat.D'altra banda, les mecàniques de joc dedicades a la construcció d'una base d'operacions són, segurament, el que podria decebre més als jugadors experimentats en aquesta tipologia de joc i la majoria d'ells consideraria que al joc li falta contingut.Més enllà de totes les seves carències, però, insisteixo en que és un bon joc i ben fet. Pot satisfer força, per exemple, a algú que no tingui experiència i vulgui iniciar-se en jocs de supervivència centrats en l'exploració i la construcció de base  d'operacions.La fortalesa de Farsky es troba en el seu caràcter inmersiu, atmosfèric. Junt amb un ritme de joc que depèn totalment del jugador. Els efectes visuals destinats al fet d'intentar recrear que ens trobem en el fons del mar, junt amb els efectes de so i la banda sonora, tot plegat (com una suma inseparable) senzillament em va enamorar.Al seu torn, el conjunt de mecàniques que acompanya aquesta atmosfera (si bé incorpora una mica d'acció) permet mantenir un ritme de joc força moderat i fa que resulti fins i tot relaxant. De fet, és totalment a les mans de cada jugador accelerar el ritme per guanyar la partida o entrenir-se i gaudir contemplant el bonic fons marí (per exemple, al final d'una dia dur de feina)."

First, there is no deformable terrain.  Mining involves pointing at a hill with a bunch of flecks of metal in it, and holding down the mining button forever until you've got all the materials you could want.  Next, base expanding is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and I ended up locking myself out of my base and just making it worse with every attempt to fix it.  I spent over a half hour googling and trying to figure out how to build my base the right way but it wasn't worth it.  Finally, the lack of crafting options makes the game feel very shallow -- you can build maybe a dozen things, and in the case of scuba-suit upgrades you can skip many of the tiers of gear if you point your drill at the right metal-flaked mound for a few minutes.This game is basically a first person aquarium simulator with a couple extra toys to give you the illusion of depth.  I'm also under the impression devs will no longer be updating this game, due to some forum conversations.  It's not the worst game, but it feels unfinished and kludgy.  There's a serious lack of fun, and I cannot recommend spending more than $5."
,Not Recommended,286340,19533236,"Posted: 6 December, 2015",all,Elthar,"I honestly wanted to recommend this game - because there are aspects that I liked - but I cannot.First and foremost my save game became corrupted after 3 hours of playing, and that did it. There's lost of other bugs in this game, like sharks spawning out of nowhere next to you and killing you in one bite, bugs in crafting and so on. Feels like an Early Access pushed out because the developer got bored or something.Secondly, the whole concept if this game is ridiculous and perverted. I wanted to say that the author has no understanding of even the simplest concept of school-level physics, but it is much more worse - they do not even understand how water and swimming works, least of all, how swimming under the water might be working.The whole game is based on the premise that the protagonist's submarine is broken (in pieces, no less) and so they are stuck underwater, because they cannot JUMP high enough to reach the surface! So we have to craft a base to survive underwater and actually go DEEPER to gather pieces of the broken up submarine, so it can bring us back up and above. Because, I repeat, when you are deep underwater, you can only walk and jump and hold that electrical thing that moves you fast. But it can't move you to the surface either. Not to mention that we're walking and jumping at depths that would be completely rid of color and light, and not survivable by a human on it's own, but that just some geek details, right?Maybe I am so picky about this because I have over 40 dives logged, but with all the bugs this is beyond ridiculous."

It makes exploring in sandbox mode so much more difficult, needing to remember which way you too to get to some new resources..Few times I have died this way completely unessacary, and could easily be prevented by a compass, and/or have your base stay on your radar/map as you leave further from it.I have actual scuba training, you should have a compass, it's implimented on hookups to your tank for crying out loud with your regulator, and octopus. Also Why can you only jump like 4 or 5 times underwater? You have a BC (Boyancy control Device) Which can add or remove air from your suit which will raise or lower you by itself, let alone your legs.. Jumping up onto ledges as you rise from a fardepth...what?It's also missing alot of equipment and other things that could of easily been added to it.. Sure you got a knife, and a speargun, and spears, by why can't you use a spear as a long range melee weapon when only 1 left, or create a longer one just for it? You can only build a table, and a stool for furnature for luxury wise, and other than your workshops, theirs not much else to do besides quickly upgrading your gear.Sure it has fun exploration, and it's cool to see the wild-life in action, but their isn't really much to do when you get down to it. It has abit of replay value because of the generation and the sealife cause you won't always see a blue-whale pass you by or dolphins, even anglerfish. But that can only last so long, when they missed out on the building entirely. Not much terrain reform either even from mining, the chances of getting the ore just goes down, and is replaced by rock.The worst thing of it all though is when you die, because theirs no HUD display of your corpse,  let alone your base, it's pretty much lost, and you will never find your stuff again, and if you're like me all your non important stuff that you have plenty of is stashed away while you have all the rare materials on you. As your entire inventory, and belt is wiped out, left only with the 3 basic equipment items you have on. Many times have I just started a new game because of this.If you want a slow-paced game focusing mainly on exploration with abit of free-building then sure this game is for you, but if you're thinking it's going to be more in line with how much other games out there like this have to offer, minecraft, the forest, 7 days to die etc, have more, and the last two are still in development. It is relaxing though, and is fun, but it kind of wears itself out quick at this rate unless they randomly come out with a patch.So yes I recommend this game, but be aware that theirs not as much as it seems. Though note I have only played the sandbox mode so far where you should have more things to do/explore."

You need to learn how to survive in the depths of the Ocean. Use the environment to gather resources, build a base to refill your oxygen and manage all your items, craft equipment and weapons to explore and protect yourself in the Ocean depths, create an in-base farm or go fish hunting to feed yourself,... Your ultimate goal is to find all the pieces of your submarine, fix it and reach the surface. You can also choose to play in Sandbox mode to enjoy the game freely with a wider map!

In my recent story playthrough, I died only one time. I would absolutely prefer permadeath as an added push, but I feel like it might push away too many new players, who don't like the difficulty.Anyway, this game has a decent balance of crafting, base building, survival, and enough of a push in the ""story"" mode to keep you going. The added perk of earning ""coins"" for sandbox mode is also pretty damn awesome. It gives you incentive to play more and more.I may not have a lot of hours logged yet, but I only got the game this week, and I know the hours in game will increase.This is 10$ you won't regret spending."

From the expansive map to the little groups of fish, this game has the right to call itself a sandbox game. While your underwater base may have bounderies to how big you can make it, you can make a new one anyway and the new one as big as the other. This game sparked my intrest and now i have a total play time of 204 hours! This game is truly amazing and i do suggest you check it out. And trust me, im not being paid to write this review, cause if i was, well, this would be a lot longer than this. And if you are a little worried that the game may suck, plenty of people on youtube have played the game, like Lordminion. Also when your at the sandbox screen where you can input settings for your ocean i would say, type in wwssadad. 40000 free gold coins. Its really useful at times. Oh and you can put it in multiple times. So yeah. Thats my review i guess. 10 out of 10 IGN."

It is not a super-serious game, but it gives you the under-water aquatic life style feel you want.The music for the game is lovely, I'd buy the soundtrack if I had money to spare for it.The idea of the campaign is to find 9 pieces of your missing submarine, while expanding your aquatic underwater base to survive and gather equipment.Hunt fish for food, but be wary as sharks and other predators will smell the blood and attack you.There are 3 levels of depth in the game, which you can easily clear if you mine the ores and create the necessary equipment.  Which becomes very redundant in the sandbox mode which at most can entertain you for a good 16 hours.I do reccomend this game as I bought it on sale for $4.99, but I would not reccomend paying the full price of the game as others have mentioned it is not worth the $15 full price."

The graphics are a bit old school but what it lacks in visual, it makes up for in enjoyment.Basically, you are stuck on the bottom of the ocean and are trying to find pieces of your ship.. meanwhile you try to survive the ocean's depths are predators. The base is a bit cut and dry, but it still fun to play around with. Food can be difficult to come by until you get some little farms up and running. Once you put some time into it, you can really get into a nice groove and work your way to the outskirts of the map. When the main objective is complete and you know longer have a set goal it can get a bit dull, but its still fun to play around on the ocean floor!As you can see, I spent quite a bit of time on this game and I'm sure I'll pick it up again in the future.

Don't get me wrong it looks very good and the concept of working underwater is an interesting one. I'm missing a real challange however. I took 2 hours to get through the adventure mode and I was actually already bored halfway in. There's only so many things to make and building bases isn't as intuitive as I'd like it to be. Fighting in the game was also slightly frustrating.What I need to make this game better: challanges, goals, achievements... (build a 5 story base, gather x resources, operate y equipment, harvest plant z, ...), multiplayer would also be a very good addition to this type of game.I can't recommend at this time sadly because I can sum up the entire game in 3 concepts: resource gathering, shooting insane fast predator fish, walk around looking for 9 pieces of submarine..."

It was short but also still kept me wanting to play more because of the big wide ocean I could go out and explore with all the sea life with it. With killer sharks always trying to kill me or for looking for better materials to upgrade some of the equipment and to be able to get better equipment for example the sub or speargun. The building on farsky is far from the best because of the lack of types of buildings and the very few intearer items to decorate your place with but to be honest the drive that kept me playing was the idea that there was more to unlock but after everything is unlocked then that's really it to the whole game. So overall I do think this game is worth it if you are only looking for a few hours of fun because it is fun but just for a few hours untill there is no more to do. I do not believe that this is worth the full £7 because of the lack on content which is in the game but is worth the buy if it comes on sale. Hope this helped.

Its just lacking in actual story/gameplay if you're looking for something more in depth.This game has cool crafting and survival aspects and its underwater so thats pretty fun.It's not a bad game, just a little lacking in content"
,Recommended,286340,25657651,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,Poltera,"So, I give this game a pretty decently high score.  And it's for a lot of factors. Let's say a 4 out of 5 stars.Low cost, - IT's 10$ bucks.  I don't normally expect a big complex game for 10 dollars.  And this meets the basic criteria for that much money.  About 20+ hours of fun/relax time.Mood setter type: Relax, problem solving, time killer.  If this is what you're looking for, Great.  I can give some suggestions of ther games to try if you're looking for something more complex.  Like, SubNautica, another underwater, builder/survivor.  A LOT MORE complex though.Graphics. :  Pleasant.   It's not TOO taxing on the system, and it's challenging enough to be fun.Just remember, you get what you pay for.  Don't expect a large game, and you'll enjoy the crap out of it.  It even has a challenge mode ever after you finish the main story line.  You can buy stuff for the sand box mode using the chest of coins you find at the bottom of the ocean.Content: I only saw three level/biomes (that I remember)(which don't have to be the same thing, but are in this case.) However, there was a large variety in mobs/food. You can garden, hunt, craft, build, mine, etc. The game balance is fantastic, imo.  Challenging yet attainable without pulling your hair out.  I Legitamately had a GREAT time playing this game.  Usually when I'm stressed out and just need a freaking break.  So I docked it one star for variety of biomes, but give it 4 stars for the delicate balance between challenge and enjoyment.  BRAVO! No really, that's hard to do guys.  <3 Well done.Frankly, I'd be interested in buying DLC extra content for it, but I don't think it recieves any support anymore, I'm not sure.Anyways, It's not amazing omgballz, and it's not a pathetic pos either.  Keep your expectations in check, and you'll throughgly enjoy this game. I know I did. <3"

There is not, nor will there ever be though (still, wishful thinking.)  The game is extremely short.  You see that 1.8 hrs on record?  That's 2 times playing the game, with 1 of them being a successful completion of the game. ...beating the game in less than 2 hrs?  No, this is not worth the price of $9.99 for that reason alone.I will say the game, if it was to be developed further, would have great potential and I would choose it over Subnautica...if it were to be worked on more. More content, flush out the bugs that are present, and improve the graphics some (which is, or should be, a games last part of the project.)The developer went and worked on a new project, which has a decent amount of poor reviews, to include a good number of the negative reviewers stating the same thing about that game, as I did about this game, with the needs more development, but has great potential.  Since the release of that game, the developer has been unheard from, with no new projects or talks about further developing these short ""test"" projects (my words.)In conclusion: I give this a not recommended, and I dont like giving these."

Initially I was really drawn to the game and wanted to p[lay it, then, I started to figure out how to findo resource, even though there are many things that could better be explained. The the rogue element kicked in, which initiall was ok...but then it starte dto get frustrating, mainly bcause a better explanation of what you needed to harvest to make things could have helped me plan what I needed to gather first. Then the aggrevation of all creatures attackiong you for no damn reason, even Jelly fish, which eben though they hurt, do NOT aggressively attack you in real life!There is a LOT of find an harvest items to build stuff to harverst better items them going on...and in the middle of that, you have to crafter better weaponry to kill fish for food, which attracts predators(Sharks, Barracuda, etc.)  It can get pretty damn aggrevating sometimes...THEN.... when you die, if you die AGAIN, which will happen, while enroute to getting your stuff you dropped when you died...THEN...you lose all the stuff you were after. So, hopefully you have enough iron to build a dripp or have excavators out in an iron deposit so you can harvest some to build another drill, knofe, etc... or you are screwed and starting over.There are many addicting things to thi game. Even though the graphics are more on the simple side, there are so many wonders to behold.At the same time, there is a SH!7 load of frustrating things going on  that don't necessarily need to be happening. Creature are not going to attack you as freuently as they do in this game.At the end of the day, it still gets you with, ok...just one more game and I am quitting for the day...and hours later you are still playing. Whether to catch back up or see what is next...you just keep getting drawn back in.I just had a bad run and am frustrated and, as much as I want to slam the game and say..NO, don't buy it. That would not be fair, because I am already thinking about what I will do when I play again.The game is not complicated, there is a good risk reward and the randomness that happens in real life that we all hate. Suck it up cupcake, it is what it is.You will need to balance mining/exploring/hunting to succeed, and, it will be worth it. The worlds are randomly generated so every time you start a new game, it will be different form the last.I do recommend the game. Enjoy the sights and sounds, there are many!

,Recommended,286340,17590199,"Posted: 17 August, 2015",all,Mesigno,"Far Sky is a wonderful little game in which you play as a stranded Diver who must retrieve all the parts of his submarine in order to get back to the surface and be rescued. Gameplay is largely split between a scavenger hunt-esq element in which you try to locate the pieces of your Sub and crafting elements that enable you to improve your scuba gear, weaponry and base. The controls are quite pleasent and very rarely feel slack. graphically it's no triple A title...but it's of reasonable quality and very rarely distracts from the overall gameplay. While I can reccommend picking it up at a sale price I honestly couldnt reccommend this title at full price. the main reasoning is that there really isnt that much to do in game...realistically as long as you dont bother the other fish and dont go to mad jumping around you can collect all the pieces of your submarine having never really engaged with any enemys.Alsowhile it is a lot of fun to custom build a seabase (Reinacting Sealab 2021 will always be a well appreciated thing in my book) theres only so many times you can build and re-build your base before it starts wearing a bit. The game is entirely Sandbox esq...but with it being under the ocean short of looking for the odd treasure chest theres surprisingly little down there...Another let down would be the fact that the only other mode in the game is effectively an ""Advanced"" mode where you play the game as normal only now it doesnt direct you to where the submarine parts are...which will probably double your playtime but adds little to the overall game itself...At sale price this game is a totally fun way to kill an hour or 4...and in that capacity I can really reccomend this game, it's a lot of fun!. But if it's being charged at the current full retail, the lack of alternative modes, interesting finds/easter eggs, and just general lack of anything other than the main ""Find the sub"" quest I cant honestly reccommend this at full price. if it's in the sale give it a try and release your inner captain murphy :)"

I find that disappointing because I think this game really could have gone somewhere had they stuck with it.While it is essentially a Minecraft style survival game, I feel it did have it's own unique perspective and if anything, I think it's cheap enough to spend the few dollars on it and try it out.

The game isn't in early access so the developers have no obligation to update it, but it has some serious potential and I love the direction it has come.

It can be glitchy and it'll seem like the sharks are shooting up out of the ground at you sometimes, but I personally enjoyed my time playing.

Adventure took me around 2 1/2 hours only because I was scared to go into the deep for a while and I never went night mining. After beating adventure mode you unlock survivor which is basically a harder version of adventure but still fun. While the game doesn't have the best of graphics, they are still pretty and if you just stand around and watch the wildlife swim around you (given that they are not predators trying to kill you) it is beautiful. It isn't that hard unless you decide to take on a whole group of sharks, and it can give you a solid 5-7 hours of fun. There is some aftergame stuff but not much. I would give it a solid 8/10 but only because they need to update it more, also something to make night pass faster plz, I hate staying in my base all night. Oh and there is a sandbox mode which basically allows you to do anything you want.

The atmosphere, sounds, graphics and gameplay are all great and I can see the Dev has put a lot of effort into producing what is here; however that unfrotunately is the problem - for the price of this game there just isn't enough content, which really is a shame considering how good this game could be with more development!I played adventure mode for 4 hours before I completed my submarine and was able to surface (effectively the end of the game). This was while taking my time to fully enjoy the game (I could have easily reached this point within 2 hours) - I'd fixed 3 other bases i found, build my own base, setup a harpoon array protecting my base, setup a miniture farm (growing potatoes, beans & carrots) built all in game objects and taken on the krackens while stealing their crystals (although I'm still not sure if they have a use...).  I'd say I really enjoyed the first 2 hours, but after that I was really just looking for more to do, and unfortunately there just wasn't anything else.  By the end this really made the game feel like a shallow experience (excuse the pun), where so much more could have been achieved with more content and structure.  I've started survivor mode but it does seem like more of the same, just you only have 1 life, and I'm not big on the permadeath thing, so while this miht be a big draw for some it doesn't add extra life to the game for me.If this was half the price, in Early Access or if the dev adds additional content I'd give this a thumbs up for sure, but for a finished product on Steam for £10, I just really can't recommend it as it is currently.  Not when there are some fantastic games on steam for a third of the price.I really hope the dev takes this constructively and adds more content, as I'd love to play more (and I will deffinitely keep an eye ourr for more oth their games)! Here are some suggestions I'd have for if the dev ever wanted to add more content or create DLC for this game;- add more environments (caves, shipwrecks, abyss etc)- add some side missions (maybe related to why he's down there in the first place?)- maybe create some exploratory missions (i.e. you have to find the bases down there to get something hidden in each)- make fixing the sub harder (currently you just find 9 pieces and it appears.  Maybe you could have to fix or power the sub too)- add areas of individuality to make it worth exploring (maybe things like coral gardens or the formentioned environments)- more things to do with you living space (if the game was longer I could see myself wanting to make this more like a temporary home)- more gradients for suite depth. Currently i just built one suit and could go straight to 350m.- more things to build/craft and more ores to find."

I has great potential, but it never quite became the awesome game it should have been.Crafting...The crafting is pretty week. You access the crafting table and choose the item you want, if you have the correct ingrediants in your inventory, the item is instantly made.None of the items are complicated at all. Use 20 copper ore, 2 gold, and POOF, you have an underwater scooter. There is no refining of minerals, there is no crafting of smaller components to later build a more complicated item.Also if you want to build something , but don't have the ingrediants it will show you tiny little icons of what you need, but it doesn't say what those icons are. For example I needed to make a bandage to stop my bleeding, and it needed seaweed, but the icon didn't look like seaweed and I could find anything that I was harvesting that had an icon that looked like the one shown.One last thing about the crafting. The ore to mine is everywhere. You are litterly surrounded by it. There is more ore around you then just regular stone.Graphics...The game looks very beautiful lots of underwater eye candy, The best part of the game is the look and feel of your surroundings.Sound...Sound isn't too bad, but when night comes you get some fairly bad music start to play. seems like they were trying to copy minecraft here, but where mine craft music is peaceful sounding, this music doesn't give me that feeling.The combat is also pretty week. The fish AI is basically always the same from every fish...charge at you at high speed straight on.This game could have been so much better, but it feels like a game that is still in Alpha, but it is a finished game."

The scenery is pleasant from my short time playing. I would spend more time with it, but the game spans my dual monitor setup in both full screen and windowed mode making all the center game action fall on the gap between my two monitors. There seems to be no adjustment for window size and I've been unable to find any tips or tricks in the forum to overcome this shortcoming. There seems to be very little activity in the forums from the dev and forum chatter is that the dev is done with this game and is/has moved on to something else. I do feel cheated, as I could not play the game in a suitable way and there may never be fixes.Maybe this game and other projects like it should have a Steam category like: Temporal, Short run, Test bed, etc. Something identifying such projects as something with short lived dev updates and support. The price for such games should have a cap as well. I realize original titles like Farsky take much effort to bring to market, but if it's meant to be a short lived project, then don't soak players, because we will be less likely to buy games from that dev again.

These are:1)Underwater gameplay2)Craftable drills that mine resources for you.3)Swimming Mule-gundrones.Other differances are alternative versions of minecraft gameplay(Drill=Pickaxe Harpoon=Bow etc)The crafting system has much less to offer then minecraft. In fact There are less then 40 recepies(Minecraft has almost 100 or maybe more).The bigest problem though is the exploration, The player is always limited to maximum presure of used diving suit, What realy hurts is that  one ore that is required to make better helmets for presure resistance almost always spawns in tons just a few hundred meters below the starting depth tolerance. This forced me to restart a game more times then i can count.Another isuee is  the day and night mecanic. In minecraft it was a chalange becouse monsters could find you. Under the sea  though  predators(Sharks are the only mob that atacks on sight) find you in about 30 seconds after nightfall,The only thing to do is to jump yourself al the way back to your base,(No running mecanic is present and walking is limited becouse of the legendary invisible walls). And it seems inside it even a nuke couldent hit.NPC's just circle it blainlesly. It looks nice, but after 10 minutes of night with a moran shark doing 360's around your house you just get sick of it. The only thing capable of killing during the night is death from starvation."

FarSky is light on story as well as content.The game will take most people two hours tops to finish. It is an underwater exploration game where you must find 9 pieces of your broken submarine to escape. Most of your time will be spent scaging for supplies, which are mostly easy to find and unlimited (minus a few rare items, like gold) once found. The game isn't very diffucult, though predators (sharks, etc) will kill you on sight, rarely is there a chance to escape, and at night time they are everywhere, leaving you standing in base for minutes at a time doing nothing.The atmosphere is fantastic though, you really feel like you are explording the unknown of the ocean and fearful of what you might encounter next, and also the pure lonelyness of being at the bottom of the ocean.Once the main mode is finished, you unlike a harder variation of it, that gives you one life. I only used 4 lives during my playthrough.There is a sandbox mode where you can use coins found in the normal mode to buy objects and use them as you see fit, but the building options and crafting is pretty limited, so I don't see it having very long legs. The only things you can craft are pieces of equipment, food, weapons, and bases / furniture, something uneeded in the core game.For $15 the asking price is a bit much. This game would be easily recommendable at $5, but in the current form and price I can't recommend anyone buy it, unless they just can't help but want to get mauled by sharks underwater.I can say I did have fun with the game while it lasted, it is an enjoyable experience, it just ends too soon and doesn't feel like a fully realized concept, just the tip, if you will.If you'd like to see what the game is like here is a fully playthrough of the original mode by yours truely.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzOSSXPoCAs"
,Recommended,286340,29788639,Posted: 8 February,all,Darkshanubi,"Almost bought Subnautica because they were both on special and then I came across this...Honestly hands-down one of the most impressive and innovative sandbox games I have come across in quite some time and has one of the most amazing functions for me. And it isn't even mentioned in the description. What is this function you ask?Well simply put it's the Game+ function they we've all come to know and love from Japanese RPG's, and so many games don't even consider including any more. By collecting 'buried teasure' although not always that will hidden. Will net you gold that you can use to buy extra starting gear in a Survival Playthrough. This to me is amazing, basically the key factor of this mode is the rogue-like feel of fearing for your characters life (because if you die... game over), combined with being able to customize your play experience in the form of the items you choose to take with you from your submarine.So prioritizing better starting gathering gear, oxygen tank, etc. means you need to strategize your play though. EPICNESS!It gives the more experienced and shall we say those who have played a game for a while and collect lots of gold a decent advantage over a new player. Would absolutely love to see this game turn into some sort of MMO. Where the current adventure mode becomes a sort of noob tutorial. So once you get your submarine the main game starts. So many ways you could go with this, who are you the character. A marine biologist, soldier stranded away from the scientist you were protecting on their mission. Quests, Guilds (or Environmental organization). So much potential here guys, just please don't make the mistake that NoMan'sSky made and over promise before you are able to deliver. I see incredible future for this game, such breathe-taking scenery and the ambience and sound effects and music - give that bladdy sound team of yours a Bell's from me they deserve it. And that sound scaping combined with the amazing visuals, you guys have a lot of potential for possible VR support later on. I have no idea how long you guys spent on this game, but I thank you for your effort. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and easily something I can see myself spending a few more hours in this marvelous world you created."

It offers a challanging experience but it is rewarding. Finding chests of gold increases your money for starting with extra objects in Sandbox mode, which is helpful because in Sandbox mode you start with much less than in Adventure.

The depths seem to be divided in three sections. highest has sharks, barracudas (if i spelled that correctly.)  generic fish life, and iron.  Mid depth has copper, more fish types, frill sharks, and angler fishes. bottom level has giant octopi,You have to play the story to unlock survival, i believe. But the story is short. collect 9 submarine peices and resurface.  to get the sub peices you have to make a suit able to handle the next level of depth.mechanics in the game. you have a limited air supply which you have to return to base to refill. there are a few vegetables you can farm in your base as well as hunting fish. (blood will spill and attract predators. from what i recal and you can get a bleeding status in this game.) you have 5 jumps to so you feel good about climbing back up the cliff face.My issue with the game.. I haven't played the survival so i don't know if there is more to it or not... in story from what i saw, even after getting the sub you could only dive 350 meters down. when you depth gauge would list hundreds more.. and you can stare off into the abyss... so further exploration is just sitting there teasing you. not letting you have it... you get used to the predators FAST. They also kinda loose their threat when you get a spear gun.. which is the only real weapon you can use against them.. the knife is more for hunting and the predators... well arn't easy to just hunt.  I guess where I'm going with this is.. I got used to it to fast. As while it has a lot to offer. it doesn't stay new as long as i wish it would.I love the idea of a game like this.. I just wish there was more to it than there is.. that's not nessicarilly a bad thing.. it left me wanting more.. and i can only hope there will be more added. But for now.. is it worth the 15$.. the fact that i realized 3 hours had passed only after they had passed.  is a good notion to it being worth it.. but how long before it becomes repetative to me is what makes me wonder if the 15$ is worth it."

It isn't anything revolutionary but it's NICE. If you're looking for a way to kill time, Farsky is a quite the pretty thing to help you with that.The graphics ARE beautiful and unique and the sceneries throughout the game really catch your eye.The story in the other hand isn't such a charmer, pretty much the basic stuff, BUT it fulfills it's duty. The plot works with the gameplay, so no big complaints made here.The exploration too starts to repeat itself after a while, but the game is fairly short, so this won't be a big problem either if you beat the game as I did: Basically by running it through.The only big minus that I have for the game, is for the beginning of it. You'll really grow to enjoy this game, but at first it is very hard to get hang of ANYTHING since there is absolutely NO TUTORIAL in the game.Yeah, one might say discovering things in games like this is point of this genre, but I think that it's a pity that there is absolutely no guidelines at all for those who have never played games like these.

My only quarrel is that it didn't really have much to offer after you'd maxed your gear, crafted all the shiny stuff, and completed the adventure mode, which can be done quite easily in about 4-5 hours. Overall if you're looking for something that's short and sweet, fairly immersive and not overly fast paced than this game is going to be the way to go.

Adventure is the game as meant to be played, you are stranded on the bottom of the ocean and need to find the parts of your sub to get to the surface again. When adventure mode us complete you unlock survivor, it is the same basic premise of finding your sub, but opponants are more common, you only have one life (no respawns), and most importantly the sub parts have no locators, so you need to manually find them, which can be quite hard.

Not being able to see in deeper water was nerve-wracking and exciting. My only issue is that I get nauseated by heights and falling in he ocean gave me stomach flips just like watching falling off cliffs, flying, or coaster POV.The game got easier once I found some manganese, but getting to it was a trick I tell you.

So far i think ive got what i paid for and more. This game is an excellent survival game. When you first start you get this feeling of how small you are in the huge ocean. The enviorment is beautiful, and exploring it is fun. I died alot at first, but after a while i got the hang of what was going on. I was able to tell the diffrent sounds of enemies. At first i always would run from enemies and almost always die. Once i got the knife, i learned how to fight them, and it became easier as i did it. I learned at night to stay near the base, but not stay inside to long because i would need to look for food. Ive always been afraid to go underwater in games, because of sharks and other things, so this game kept me on the edge. Ive very much enjoyed it and hope anyone who purchases it does also."

A plus side of this game is the ability to run on even the most basic hardware. While subnautica was unplayable on my laptop even with all of the graphics settings turned down, this game had no problems running and the enire game is around 200mb.

'Farsky' was basically the underwater survival game BEFORE underwater survival games; honestly if it would have continued in development it would have totally eclipsed 'Subnautica'. 'Farsky' was off to such a great start, an expansive world, a solid survival game with no visible or glaring glitches; in fact if someone were to go back to it right now it may actually provide a decent finished product. Not only did it seem to be rather unfinished, it also reeked of outdated graphics and dialogue; the comms system between the player and the woman gave me an oddly nostalgic feel however nostalgic a quite unpleasant, unnecessarily old feeling. The game also allowed for the player to complete the game in under 15 minutes (as I did about a year ago now), which just exposes the fact the game requires more content; it provides no challenge."

Beautiful scenery and well-chosen music give this game a perfect atmosphere, especially when using headphones. In fact, sound plays a huge role in this game, as learning what noises each critter makes can save your life. Rushing water can tell you when a hunter is charging at you, the chirping of dolphins can reassure you when your nervous, and a whale's song still draws me to the windows of my base no matter how many times I've heard it.However, audio can only take a game so far without good visuals, and FarSky has some of the best visuals I've seen. Screenshot opportunities abound, and within 10 minutes of gameplay I was able to snap one of a whale swimming above some giant seaweed while a school of manta rays attempted to get out of the way.Then, night begins to fall. Hunters begin to awake, and the peacful ocean floor becomes their hunting ground. As the ocean becomes dark, you have the choice to either face the oceans predators, or stay in your base until dawn. That's a lot of how this game works; it's a risk versus reward system. You can either stay where it's safe, or gain resources to advance.Of course, with this being an underwater game, you will find various things to help you throughout your world. Mineral deposits, wrecked ships, treasure chests, and much more rarely, entire underwater bases. The bases are yet another example of risk versus reward. Since most bases you'll find (besides your starting base) are flooded, you'll be faced with a choice to either use some materials to fix up the base and claim it as your own, or just salvage what you can and move on.When you start, you are given only the most basic of supplies, and you have to swim a bit before you even get to your base. Once you do, the biggest concern in this game is hunger. Hunger is more likely to kill new players than anything else, as you need to play a while before you have a stable food source. You can either take the time to grow your own food, or risk attracting predators by killing fish.While this game has many strengths, it also has a few weaknesses, as follows:While the ocean graphics are stellar, the man made graphics could use some work.The inventory needs to be easier to use, and the chests need to hold more.The music needs to fade from one song to the next, instead of the sudden stops it currently has.Every resource needs a purpose, like crude equipment made using rocks and seaweed.The weapons need ways to upgrade them using better materials.More items and such in generalOne last thing: There are some people who say this game needs a higher difficulty.The way to do this would not be to challenge the player's skill, but to challenge their mind. A harder version of this game should employ strategy rather than merely how powerful your equipment is or how well you can aim.Overall, this game is a gem that merely needs to be polished a bit more. Come for the gameplay, stay for the beauty."

I think this game was fun and if you try to beat both survival modes you can easily get 6-8 hours of game play out of it making it worth the price.  However, there are some serious issues for some people trying to get the game to launch.  I posted my solution below just in case others have problems because it took me a while to find and was very frustrating.  My total playtime is about 6 hours but I had to run it outside of steam so it only says 7 minutes.Hey everyone. I delved through most of the posts here and there was a fix that worked for me but it wasn't clear. This is what I recommend.Check all drivers and make sure that you have the correct version of Java installed. This should always be done so I posted it, but then what worked for me was the following.On a Windows 8 systems go to your Steam Library. Right click FarSky and choose Properties. Go to Local Files and select Browse Local Files. Inside this folder find the application executable farskyExec. Right click farskyExec, hover over Run with Graphics Processor and then select High-performance processor.Doing this step made the game launch and I played with no issues. I tried to change the settings under my graphics card control panel to always launch with this setting but it didn't take, so I would recommend that if this works just to launch it this way each time. The only problem is you don't get the time recording or steam overlay when you play.The game is fun but short and worth playing if you bought it. If you did both survival modes could probably easily squeeze about 6-8 hours out of this game making it worth the money imo."

I bought it figuring as an older person, it would take me awhile to figure it out.  5 hours for them is a nice week for me =P.But no.  Once you figure out the limited amount of crafting in this game, and are seriously collecting sub pieces.. 5 hours is probably a stretch for the amount of time it would actually take you.  I managed 16hrs by restarting a few times (glitch in one case and accidentally deleted my ladder in the other... don't do it!), buidling a big base, replacing items I lost due to a kracken, and fixing some random things found on the map before I got down to the actual goal. An amusing way to spend an afternoon, but that's it.Still, it is worth the money I personally paid for it, and I'm sure I'll play a bit longer before it gathers dust in my library, so I will recommend.

,Recommended,286340,19666144,"Posted: 12 December, 2015",all,Muut,"TLDR; get it while it's on sale - it's kind of fun, but also kind of short.In the standard 'adventurer' mode you need to rebuild a broken submarine from scattered parts which are shown on your map, and then take it to the surface to end the game. It's therefore a matter of progressing through three tiers of diving gear tech until you can physically get deep enough to pick up the more far-flung pieces. There's ore-drilling, base-building, and hunting/farming along the way, but I finished at a casual and meandering pace in about 4-5 hours.Having completed standard mode the survival mode unlocks, in which the objective is the same but the sub pieces aren't shown on radar. You also only get one life, and since you aren't any faster than the dangerous fish there is definitely some challenge involved. This does give a bit of scope for a replay, but I didn't go for it because by the time I'd finished standard mode there didn't seem to be much more to see.Sandbox mode also exists; I didn't try it out for the same reason, but I'm going to guess that it's similar to adventurer mode minus the get-to-the-surface objective.What's there is good - it's fun to play, all the mechanics work well, and I didn't run into any bugs, but it does seem like a case of missed potential. There's deeper ocean that you can't progress to because the technology runs out, not a whole load of stuff to craft once you've hit the third tier, some craftables that you don't really need (for example an enhanced drill that becomes available around the same time that you've already mined everything you need), and nothing much to do once you've bolted the sub together aside from wandering the map and building similar bases elsewhere.It's well worth the current 75%-off sale price for an evening's entertainment, but there are probably better options otherwise.Lost potential / 10"

Grim,"Thought I'd just give a review of my first aquatic survival ;PSince I have never done review I will just do a pros and cons list :P* Warning * Wordy content, I am not good at expressing things in short simple sentences...* Warning * Spoiler alert :PSkip to the bottom for an all-around impression.Let us start with cons, just to get them out of the way.No voicing.Well, for the price I don't rly expect it, but for the few lines that get spoken in the game, a little voice acting would be nice and help with the atmospheric feel of the game.Content...It feels like the project is just not finished, it has too little content, and progressions through the game is fast.CraftingThe crafting isn't complicated and doesn't feel that rewarding, plus isn't that much to craft either.No material upgrades, and two resources that I still cannot figure a use for is stone and sand.ResourcesWell, it is easy to get everything you need, even when you are playing in survival. Moreover, the only thing that makes it a little tougher is the rare resources which you need to search a little for, but still after 2-3 nodes, you've got enough for completing the game and getting the tools/gear you wanted it for.DronesWell, as they were epic friends to have in game, and was very useful at times, they did do a few things to help the game kill me... when you are in a dangerous spot, and like me play sandbox with max mob spawn, they can decide to aggro a mob. The problem is that you have no way to turn off the drones (as far as I know), and no way of upgrading the drones to use more powerful harpoons.BasesWell the biggest let down was that through my first play through (and all games after that) I have still not experienced that my base hull loses integrity... No sprung leaks yet, should probably be happy for this, but I was looking forward to the challenge...However, you do find random spawned bases in the world, and they have already lost hull integrity.Can't think of anything more so that's it for the cons ;3Pros!DialogueAll the dialogue is short and to the point, no needless long explanations or exaggerated stuff.Content.You have variation! Moreover, pretty good variations. Not just a change of textures like some games do, but actual new fish models (e.g. several different sharks, hammer sharks, great white sharks, normal sharks? (Size wise), several different smaller fishes etc.)The worldIt is rich in life, both with fishes and sea forests, the scenery changes according to location/level/depth. Therefore, you actually feel that you are getting deeper.Reefs and the sea floor channels just helps this world feel real.The horror of going too deep!Holy S**T the jump scare I got when I went too far down on my first game, didn't check my max depth level and went too far down, the sound and animation... the fact that your field of view gets obstructed at a certain point just makes it worse... cheers devs. for that, love it!GraphicsThis is an important point for the price range of this game, and probably why I feel the content is a little lacking.The graphics are good, and honestly, unless you are a nit-picky brat you are not going to complain, the photos tell the story, and it looks great in game! The character models/ fish models are good and do not have blocky or strange triangular shapes.AudioThe sound is nice and the ambient sounds make you feel like you are in the sea. The nice thing for us who do not like jump scares that much, is the warning sound the big fish/predators make when they come close to you, and how it changes when they attack.You also have some nice ambient music running in the background, and it fits the mood of the game :)DronesYour most helpful tool throughout the game are the drones, and you cannot build them! However, they are easy to acquire once found and not costly in any way. Second of all is that they act like a backpack, a little extra inventory is always needed when out raiding old treasure chests ;DBasesThe hands down coolest thing in the game are the random bases (not pretties mind you, which is the sub-aquatic world). When you find one it will in ways ""activate"" as it's lost hull integrity it's your job fixing it up (if you feel like it), and you can at first actually see the water level rising inside the structure! Was actually running around frantic the first time I found one trying to fix it up before the water level rose all the way xDAll in all impressionIt is a good game and well worth the price, I will probably jump in every now and then and just mess around a little, however, after completing the game I will not be spending much time in this game. I would say this game is made for children rather than adults, I say this with regards to the learning curve and difficulty of understanding crafting and survival basics of the game. However, it is cheap and leaves a lasting expression on you, so check it out if you like aquatic games!Thx, for reading and I hope this helps you decide to buy the game!"
,Recommended,286340,15991729,"Posted: 24 May, 2015",all,Nwerp,"A sandbox survival game with a simplistic crafting system taken place beneath the depths. The players assumes control of a aquanaut whose submarine has crashed and must find and reconstruct it. You must scavenge for food and goods, all the while monitoring your oxygen levels. A desolate, abandoned underwater base initially is the safe zone for the player; the player can revitalize his depleted oxygen levels, can craft items or cultivate potatoes (potatoes... so many... potatoes...), and can take shelter from dangerous aquatic predators (night is when they're most active). The world is filled with life and you truly never feel alone because of the sheer amount of fish and vegetation surrounding you while you explore. What hinders the game unfortunately is the brief story, however it reciprocates with a sandbox and survival mode.My convoluted review can be summarized to this: I had a great experience with FarSky and will recommend to those who can appreciate a new twist on the survival genre."

I did not do story mode yet, just sandbox, so this is all about sandbox mode.You start out with just your extraction tool and your base that you immediately have to decide where to place on the ocean floor because your oxygen is running out. Since the world is procedurally generated you might get lucky and find a whole bunch of gold and coal deposits close by, or you may have to really search for a decent place to create your base that will not have you getting lost constantly, racing back home all the time to eat and refill your 02.An annoying thing common with this game and others like it within the survival genre is the fact that you have to constantly keep eating millions of calories like you are a sumo wrestler with a tape worm.

You must all be super high and have the munchies because every single survival game focuses so heavily on eating everything in sight.

I bought this game a while ago when it was just 3$. It looked pretty interesting. Like minecraft, but underwater. You know? Pretty good pull. Pictures are nice. Downloaded the game. Played for about an hour and finished the game. Even killed the Kraken too. I pulled out Sandbox mode and figured I'd play that for a while. But at that time, I've already seen everything and everything was just boring and old. There was nothing new.Pros:Underwater minecraft. Honestly. That's a given.Simplicity is great. Mine resources, refill your air tank, don't die by predators, die by predators, rinse and repeat.Fun for about an hour.Damn good idea.So many ♥♥♥♥ing predators, really suspenseful.Cons:Easy as♥♥♥♥♥♥Hardly any resource variety.Boring after about an hour of gameplay/beating the game once.No variety in crafting items.Two weapons. Knife, Harpoon Gun. I need more than that♥♥♥♥♥♥In Sandbox mode there are no randomly generated bases. Absolutely none. And if there are, I never found any after about 2 hours of searching.No ♥♥♥♥ing variety.Did I mention there is no variety?Can't forget the lack of variety.Not worth 15$ dollars.Not really even worth 3$.No way of finding out if there's something attacking you besides a rush of water.This game should be a Beta. Honestly it shouldn't be a full release game. I don't understand why the devs think they did a good job on it when honestly they made me waste about 2 hours of my life. Sure, it was interesting and new for an hour but after that it was a waste. The variety is comparable to nothing. I tried comparing it to something. I was here for a minute trying to figure out what I can compare it to and I found nothing. It's variety is horrid and it doesn't even deserve to be sold for 15$ a copy. It should be withdrawn or continued to be updated by the devs. How hard is it to develop more items to use? Obviously not worth it to the devs since they think that its a 15$ game. Maybe if the damn devs decide to add items I will change it to recommended. As for right now. Don't waste your money. Buy something like Terraria. It's game is about 20x better than this one."

,Recommended,286340,15498164,"Posted: 22 April, 2015",all,WonderWhy,"TL;DR: Could be better but is a good game to have some fun for a few hours if you buy it on sale.First of all, sorry for my grammar (not my language) plus I'm giving a positive review only for those who buy the game with discount/on sale. Like, reaaally on sale. I don't think the game is worth the full price.8 hours in the game and I played both sandbox and finished the adventure mode.Negatives:1) BASICS: I had trouble figuring out how some things in the game worked, since they don't give any tips when you start the game. You have to figure out by yourself. I went to the controls menu and googled some things. For that I suggest you start playing in sandbox mode so you can try everything, kill and be killed, and know how it all works. Could be improved.2) NIGHT TIME: You can't reeeally tell when the night has come to an end. I mean, you know when it's night because sharks will be all around you poking your flesh but to know when it's day I have to go out see if there are any sharks coming my way. The light changes slightly but is not that visible. Could be improved.3) DEATH: When you die your things go to a chest in the local of death (cool!) but, if go get it and get killed again in the way the previous chest is gone. You lose all things. Not cool!! Could be improved.4) SLEEPING: There's no way to sleep even though Natan says something about it. And it would be cool to sleep through th night instead of starring a wall for 5 minutes.POSITIVES:The idea behind the game is good, and if you like sandboxes, or something related to minecraft you'll like this. The passive and agressive mobs are cool. Besides that, this is a game to pass time and have some hours of fun."

I'm a sucker for underwater environments, and this one is a rather pretty, stylized one. Resource-gathering is also relatively easy compared to other survival games; resources are quite easy to spot, and you can put Extractors on resource deposits to mine while you explore.This may mean, however, that the game is a bit too easy for Survival fans. The story mode is short, crafting is rather simplistic and there are far too few recipes. The sandbox suffers because of the lack of crafting; sure, you can make a huge underwater base, but you'll quickly run out of stuff to put in the rooms, for decoration or otherwise. Even the nastier creatures near the end of the game become pushovers once you've gotten some end-game items, which, again, aren't particularly hard to get thanks to Extractors.I hope the game's sparseness means that there will be content updates and such. Otherwise, the price tag is a little harder to justify. Still, I recommend it if only for the atmosphere, and I hope the devs expand this lovely game!"

You must hunt and gather food and resources to survive. You can grow vegetables in your underwater base and craft better equipment for exploring the ocean floor.

Which mostly consists of ""How to get food here"" and ""How much time left before my air runs out and I drown.""

Though, it does let you make something neat and elaborate if you come from a Minecraft creation-loving background. Sadly, it lacks a lot of reason to, as the most space-requiring thing is a few farms.Overal: 8/10 - Could use some new content, solid short game unless you get into exploring new areas/base making.Best Part: Exploring and figuring out the tricks of the game, like finding ship wrecks.Worst Part: Beating it in four hours, weird logic on some fish making them circle you after charging in a tiny spiral until they hit instead of swimming away for another attack."

Looks gorgeous, plays nice and easy and performs smooth but has a very limited gameplay scope. Consider it an anti-stress game to grab ONLY during a sale.There are gameplay elements, of course, and there is also a goal to be achieved here (in case you are playing the Story Mode), which is to gather the materials required to construct a submarine, with the (ironic) purpose of taking you back to the surface.So, this is where you may be put off a bit, as this is what you WILL do (I can almost guarantee):-Gather Iron to Construct all the different crafting tables.-Hunt for some shipwrecks to get some crafting materials and also, to find some seeds and vases to grow your own potatoes and carrots.-Find some gold ore to be able to craft better helmets that allow you to go deeper in the water, so you can find some more crafting materials that combined with gold will allow you to craft better helmets that allow you to go deeper in the water, so you can find some more crafting materials that combined with gold will allow you to craft better helmets that allow you to go deeper in the water, so you can find some more crafting materials that combined with gold will allow you to craft better helmets that allow you to go deeper in the water... you get it-Find a knife so you can kill as much fish as you want without being worried with ammunition as you were until now with your harpoon, and also, so you can cut down algae and some ""power algae"" that provides you with a nice power orb (required for your submarine).-When you finally get your best helmet (and matching oxygen tank that will allow you to stay more time in the water), you can now access the depth at which the rare material spawns (and also where the most beautiful parts of the game).-Get the material, escape the furious Kraken(s) that where supposedly guarding it and craft the submarine to get back to the surface and win the game.All I described above WILL be the thing that you will do in Story mode, for almost exactly an hour. There is a sandbox mode, which is basically the same but does not end the game when you get to the surface.That is where the survival ends and the ""interactive experience"" starts as you may explore the seemingly infinite randomly-generated underwater surface.Still interested?As much as I like the game, I cannot recommend you to buy it in full price, but at the time I write this, there is a very tempting 80% discount, making it 3€.

Aside from the lack of content a great game with nice visuals and predators that will cause you to, on occasion, lose your cool as you have no idea where the hell that Kraken came from.Overall a 6/10Would be more if there was more to do.Would recommend only if on sale as £10.99 is a extraordinary price for a game witch I felt was worth £5.00 or less."

Music is a bit similar to minecraft as well. and just like minecraft there are more ""monsters"" at night .

I ""won"" the game, said, ""That wasn't bad,"" and uninstalled to pare down some of the ""wall of text"" that was my games list.A couple of months later, frustrated with balance issues in an Early Access sandbox game, I just wanted a sandbox. game. that. worked.  Where the enemies were probably going to murder me, sure, but only if I wasn't smart enough to avoid them.  Where the equipment worked as planned and had clear crafting goals.  And that was only as grindy as I wanted it to be, because I was really, really sick of spending ten hours looking for the most basic components and getting slaughtered by the equivalent of slimes spawning every three seconds.  In short, I wanted something casual where I didn't feel like lighting my computer on fire an hour in.  So I reinstalled it, ""beat"" the game again (I seem to stick with Adventure Mode with this game, not Sandbox), had that brief feeling of accomplishment, and uninstalled again.Yeah, I went through that cycle three more times before I finally just left the game right where it was.  Now whenever I want something short and simple I don't even have to walk away from--at this point I can fix a submarine in 90 minutes--I fire this up, noodle around for a bit and call it good.Cons:It's shortThere's not a whole lot of variation in crafting materials, things to build, or things to killThere's no tutorial (that I can remember--at this point, if they've added it, I'm long past looking for it)Pros:It's shortThere's enough rarity built-in to get you out of your base without being a ten-hour grindA tutorial wasn't really necessaryTL;DR:  Don't go into it expecting a five-course meal, but if all you want is a candy bar, it's pretty satisfying."

The art design, the music, the crafting system all work to create a tranquil gaming experience.  The storyline is basic - survive, repair and return - you decide how/when/where to do that.  There are a variety of aquatic life forms - both flora and fauna - to delight the eye and add to immersion; but insufficient to encourage re-playability without the player's own ingenuity.   The cooking/farming and crafting are entertaining, but expanding those skills falls short of really essential.  That all being said - its a game I return to time and time again, and still thoroughly enjoy!There are mysteries to unravel - decisions to be made, and not just the ones mandated by the story mode.  Nuances of the environment(s) to explore.  The game is more than just ""find the pieces"", but we (the player) have to make it so; being able to mod it would go a LONG way toward extending re-playability. As a single person team, it would also go a long way toward removing the governors from this project allowing this game to truly do the genre justice!   There is SUCH awesome potential laying fallow here for a phenomenal game!Would I recommend it?  Yes, with a disclaimer.  Its beautiful, entertaining, marginally challenging but requires a lot of player innovation to prolong the fun.

Don't expect too much other than a weekend or two of gameplay (Update:If you're looking for an underwater survival game, and this one isn't on sale, PICK UP SUBNAUTICA!!! Subnautica is a solid title, has more to do, and the Devs are still working on it.)The Long Story:When looking for a game, the major points are there. Fun game mechanics, stabilty, nice design, etc. I loved playing this game. However, beware of the following:1) No developer support. I saw comments that the developer isn't going to update this game. There was a roumor that someone else picked up the game and may be looking to either expand it or write a sequel. So far, I think that is only a roumor.2) No modding community support. This probably ties into the first point. You're not going to find anything to update the game with from the user community. There are comments that the game might not even be able to be modified easily.3) Not much by way of a tutorial and tool tips are far and few between. You get some tips in the dialog between Nathan and his buddy above the ocean. You're better off reading stuff online before playing. And some of the online content is just gesswork by other players.4) Limited content. The game has three game modes (Adventure, Survival, and Sandbox), and there isn't much within them. The story is you're playing Nathan. His sub blew up. You have to survive, find the sub pieces, repair the ship, and make it back alive. That's it for story. And in game things to do is likewise very limited. Crafting, Exploration, etc.With this in mind, I still found the game very enjoyable. However, it left me wanting more. My recomendation is to get this on a steam sale, and you should only be left with wanting more."

But, I've been mistaken and I'm glad that I took this small risk of purchasing this game for my collection.FarSky has some block action aspects, like building/expanding your base, but there's much more to it. You've got exploration, nice underwater scenery and a pretty good part of planning ahead your next move.In order to, let's say, win this game in normal mode; you'll have to find 9 parts of your imploded submarine. those are scattered all over the map and some are so deep or in a dangerous location guarded by predators, that you'll need special equipment or other items to aid you in your mission.Everything in this game has been made with fun and gameplay on first place. Nothing is too hard, but all makes you want to try more and better; wondering what's going to be next on your agenda of ultimate survival and future rescue.You'll like this game if you enjoy games like Terraria, StarBound and Xenominer. (Xenominer is not yet on Steam, but can be purchased from it's website for 10 bucks. It has Internet Co-Op)The only thing that I'm missing is...maybe, a Co-Op mode for over the internet. But to be honest, I'm not sure if it would add to the general game experience of FarSky in a positive way."

The soundtrack also fits the game perfectly, being the perfect sound for and underwater game and bringing back memories of that ship wreck level from Super Mario 64.This all being said the game is quite short, you can easily beat it in two hours or so if you try to. Though the games random level generation helps to give it some replay ability and there's a sandbox survival you can always play. But if you're like me you'll spend hours just trying to make the biggest coolest base and kill as many sharks as possible.In the end I would say that you might not love this game but you won’t hate it. While I almost refunded the game myself, once i finished, I decided to give it anthoer go and found myself playing it just to look around at things and just enjoy the game for what it had to offer and what I could do in it.While it's short, it's fun and loveable though it's best to pick up when it's on sale.

It's not exactly ""Minecraft underwater"" by which I mean, rather than a randomly-generated open world with no official story, this game involves a specifically-designed map (it seems) and a concise narrative, within which you have some limited construction capabilities. It's not a long game, but it is fun while it lasts and a unique experience. It would be fun to see it modifed for use with the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, which may already exist, and if it does, I'll check it out sometime, too."

The atmosphere of the game is just great, with the music and all the underwater calm.I really enjoyed gradually mining rarer materials, upgrading my base, getting stronger weapons, being less and less afraid of attacking sharks and krakens, to finally collect the 9 submarine pieces.This game has it all, the calm, the survival instinct, the crafting, the deep explorations, and for me (maybe not for everyone) the fright, because I'm scared of deep waters and having to jump in the deep like that scared me, as well as the sharks and the krakens attacking you!However, I must admit it is a bit short, but I'm not complaining since I got it on sold for less than 5€, but it would have been nice to have more crafting options and maybe more submarine parts to retrieve to make it last longer.Anyway, great game, definitely worth it, but maybe not at full price since it's rather short! But I still give it a thumbs up because it simply amazing!"
