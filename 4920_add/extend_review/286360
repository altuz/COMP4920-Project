76561198065426173,Recommended,286360,10518499,"Posted: 18 June, 2014",all,gavin.doyle,Summary: A lackluster point and click adventure with standard puzzles.  Recommended for fans of the genre only.Pros:Good backround music.Backdrops and cut scenes are well done.Interesting plot.Cons:I found the voice acting poor.Character animation is poor.Would I buy episode 2? Yes but I would hope for an improvement.
76561198141404871,Recommended,286360,19951282,"Posted: 25 December, 2015",all,joan4003,"Based loosely on the novel ""In Nome di Dio"" (In God's Name) by Dave Yallop published originally in 1997.  This is a four game series two of which have been released.  (Shadows of the Vatican Act 1: Greed and Shadows of the Vatican Act 2: Wrath)Storyline: James Murphy left the priesthood in 1996 after the Vatican's investigation into his mentor's death was less then effective and the Vatican proved to be even less interested.  In present day he is a medical doctor in Chicago, IL (USA).  He has returned to Italy at the request of his friend Father Cristoforo who has urgent and vital information for him.  Before Cristoforo can impart this information to James, Cristoforo is nearly killed when he fell (or was pushed) down a flight of stairs.  In Act 1, James is trying to find out what Cristoforo wanted to tell him by following the clues Cristoforo left for him.Gameplay: Classic type point and game with a strong linear storyline.  The space bar brings up small magnifying glasses for search areas or areas of interest.  Since it is based on a book the storyline follows the plot of the book, and dialogue is essential to follow the story.Despite the 3D graphics most of the game has, the cutscenes are drawn comic book panels.  This in no way detracts from the gameplay and a simple picture or two progresses the gameplay quickly and concisely.There is only one actual puzzle, a maze more concisely, in this game.  It is a car chase!Mystery, intrique, greed, deception and quite possibly murder, what more could anyone want from a thriller?"
,Not Recommended,286360,29250940,Posted: 14 January,all,caubert,"I deleted my first review and thought, ok I will give the second part a chance.Still have the same feeling the developer does not know how to make an adventure game. The choice of game engine is terrible, on a good rig it still loads like many seconds, eg try to save the game and go make a coffee. Characte modeling is terrible and feels clunky.Gameplay is simple left/right mouse click, that's ok. But implementing two character model into this game is nonsence, because there is no need for that and could have been done automatically. Oh and yes, there's dissapearing inventory screen bug, that dev says has been resolved - it's not.So we come to the story. Every adventure game must have a good story, other shortcomings don't mean much when you have a good story. This game does not have a great story, it feels rushed and just does not have any vibe. Some religious nonsense - Vatican is funneling money. Yeah right really interesting.Characters are poorly written and I don't even remember protagonist names atm I am writing this.Ok the scenery should be in Rome. There's no feeling, not a slight touch even that the player is in Rome - artists don't have no impression of Rome or have just been rushed by the production again. It's almost like put Super Mario there and BANG where're in Italy : )This game is not worth the money and I don't recommend it."

There is no indication that parts three and four will ever be complete.""Art direction by Lorenzo Ruggiero""  True, but a third tier inker with a bog standard resume seems like stretching the truth a bit too far in order to use the Marvel/DC credit.""...with high resolution graphics and Full HD support"" False.  Low quality models, backgrounds, etc., The HD version will not run on many systems and the developer's (paraphrased) solution is ""Oh well, just run standard. The only difference is full HD backgrounds"" meaning that ""Full HD support"" is an outright lie.""Realistic characters with hours of motion-capture animations"" False.  Awkward student-level character model design and laughable ""motion capture.""""Well integrated puzzles..."" False.""Animated coloured comics..."" False.  Zooming in and out and panning on a still image is hardly animation.All told, you'll have a better time reading the wonderfully florid text of the store page.  The quality of writing here is far better than the in-game text and dialogues.  It was so well written, it convinced me to buy this below average, overly-ambitious game with all the red flags of a terrible adventure experience."

I like the artwork and the setting.Has maybe not aged fantastically well. Good Game all in all, for 6 bucks you get between 2 and 3 hours of old school-y Point and Clicking. Just keep in mind that it is only the first part of a story, but a fine one at that."

,Not Recommended,286360,29418044,Posted: 22 January,all,Mendhak,"Tried twice but really struggled - the voice acting was really bad.  I've played games with bad VA before but the VA here was bad enough to put me off the game - at the very least the protagonist's VA should have been a bit better to balance out the rest of the cast.The point and click puzzles aren't too bad, insofar as it's just a matter of figuring out what to click next.Despite getting it on a sale, still can't recommend it"

The tutorial wasn't the problem the game was really slow, the character, the dialouge and the box that comes up took too long to come up. I really tried, sorry."

,Recommended,286360,24056816,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,Misha,"In the Shadows on the Vatican Act I: Greed you play as an ex-priest that aspires to be/is a doctor. Due to a sinful world you tragically lose your friend and your suspicion leads you to investigate his death which leads to a awesome cliffhanger that will get you excited for part 2.This game is fun to play for as long as it lasts although all the talking can get a bit tedious and I started ""fast"" reading and thus skipping what I felt were useless conversations. There were no bugs while playing and the puzzles are alright although I did experience a little difficulty while finding the banks location.The most enjoyable elements of this game are the soundtracks and the cutscenes. I really enjoyed these, they used a good artstyle and the story was alright but maybe a bit predictable."

The backgrounds are always pretty spot on, and the dialogue flows nicely most of the time. The level of difficulty also worked for me. The model animation is clunky, yeah, but I can't really expect any better from a game that cost me nickels.Obviously, it's only Act I of the entire series, so there's no proper conclusion to the game. It's unclear whether the devs will be able to churn out all the parts, but at least there's Act II available."
,Recommended,286360,25468727,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,Bob,"This is an uninspiring point and click game. For me the story flowed too slowly, you just seemed to be vaguely following clues with not enough exposition. This also made the puzzles disappointing as they just felt you were arbitrarily clicking things without knowing what you were trying to achieve. The 2D artwork is excellent which then contrasts with the poor 3D character models. So will I buy episode 2? Maybe, I’m really not sure, the plot does come together at the end which makes me curious to know what happens next but I’m not convinced based on the rest of this game. In the end I am giving this a thumbs up but only just, it is not a bad game but it sure isn’t a good game."
76561198154757644,Recommended,286360,15879275,"Posted: 17 May, 2015",all,simdel,"Interesting while it lasts...This is a very short prologue of an adventure. The three and a half hours it took me to complete it served to build up a tense atmosphere that began to draw me into the plot. Sadly however, it ended abruptly and very frustratingly, with nothing resolved.I am not sure about these episodic adventures. On the one hand, it is understandable that developers need to release titles in parts as they need the finance to finish off the game, but on the other hand it can be very frustrating for the player that enjoys the full works. I guess this has to do with the generally low price of retail nowadays, compared to, say 15 - 20 years ago when full, long games cost at least 10 times as much. So it's not surprising short episodic chunks are being brought to us.The graphics are good and easily serve the purpose, creating a solid atmosphere. The dialogue and voice work is very well done. The main character is particularly well-voiced. The puzzles are mostly very easy as everything points the player in the right direction. The only time I had any length of difficulty (and it wasn't very long) was in a pixel puzzle where something needed to be picked up to move the story along.I notice that the second episode came out two years after this one. There are supposed to be 4 episodes in all, so it looks like this game won't be concluded for another 4 years, if the developers keep at it. Thus, I'm going to sit it out and wait for the rest to be released before I play anymore."

I was entertained through the whole experience and was quite pleased with a smaller developer achieving the level of production value present in this title. If (and hopefully when) the next act is released I would purchase it without a second thought."

,Not Recommended,286360,24325093,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,*~A~*,"In short this game feels very rough. The animations are clunky and jerky as well as character models are not the best quality. The comic cut scenes, which I looked forward to most, are low res. Imo, the best thing in the game is the character portraits while talking (if you have that option on). The load screens are absolutely awful, long and drawn out. Especially when saving/loading. It feels extremely boring and unclear of what your next task is and it feels slow and almost pointless in how to progress. The game was lacking, the story seemed like it might have potential. Personally I'd rather just watch a walkthrough."

The best part  is the comic style of the cutscenes: the dialogues and acting voices are not quite good, but the plot is interesting and sufficiently developed, also because is based on the book ""In God's Name"" of David Yallop.But, be aware, this is only the first episode and doesn't last very long!So, it is good enough to play but buy it at low price"

Not going thorugh this anymore.Although it has an instersting story, the puzzels themselves are 'unfair' which makes it impossible to solve. Not going to test every item on every spot just to see what works. Still wondering how I was suppose to know that the bookmarks go with the calenders just to get the date of briths.The puzzels are not hard, they are unsolvable."

The voice acting is terrible (Especially the character of Silvia), the puzzle logic is sometimes pretty strange. Maybe I'm just dumb but a few times I found myself having to just randomly try items on various objects to continue. And worst of all the plot is pretty nothing. I get that it's an episode 1, so it's mostly setup. But I would have liked for something to happen."

It's classic adventure game with logical puzzles. The puzzles are not too hard, but just hard enough. The ambient music is awsome,  I love music in the capena church. The actor voices are good enough. The story is great and good implemented with puzzles. You can read some books to know more about the story. The dialogs are good and classic written. I love the inventory. Its easy and functional. If you try to give something to someone and it's not correctly, then it appears red x in inventory, cool staff."
