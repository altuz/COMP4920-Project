,Not Recommended,286380,14757444,"Posted: 6 March, 2015",all,JD,"Strata is aesthetically minimalist but still manages an elegant beauty. Its sound design effectively communicates success and failure in a manner befitting the 'zen puzzler' mould it is trying to fill. Its minimalism extends to interface in a way that promotes the kind of 5 minute drop-in gaming that makes these games so addicting. Still I can't recommend this game because it fails in the one place that really matter, it's a weak puzzle.For the first 10 minutes or so I really enjoyed Strata, a simple but engaging puzzle format that seemed to have a lot of room for variation ahead of it. Then it hit me, there is a simple mechanical stratey to solve literally every puzzle of this format regardless of the size or number of colours. However complicated a solution may be it is always trivial to solve in reverse, this leads to the game quickly evolving into  busywork. Even for this low price with all the pretty packaging a bad puzzle is a bad puzzle and a thorough waste of time.I kept hoping that in the later sets the game would through in some new spin or twist on the mechanics, unless it appears in the final 6x6 it never comes. I feel like there is something hidden within this concept that could be saved, maybe a block type that is set by the bottom ribbon or requires a particular ribbon combination? In its current state the game is nothing but dissapointing.MINOR ISSUES: the game had a few navigation bugs in the level select menu which require a restart to make the game playable again. Some of the ribbon colours seem too close to each other leading to silly mistakes, this wouldn't be a big deal if the perfect system didn't punish undoing."

This is it.Similar in feel to Kami, Picross, Splice, Lyne.Everything from the graphics to the music, to the gameplay is incredibly zen and gives you peace of mind while still managing to engage you. Very easy to get into, even without the excellent yet simple tutorial.What made me first discover Strata and Kami was the wonderfully clean art-style, I was very surprised how well orchestrated the game is with small bits of beautifully crafted sounds. There seems to be no loading times for each puzzle which makes everything feel like it flows together beautifully, adding to the already peaceful setting of the game."

Levels are sorted into 7 sets. Each “set” has its owns sub-categories. (4) One as an appetizer to start slowly and the others going wider and wider from a 2x2 size up to a 6x6 size. A sub-category can have 9 levels up to 36 levels!The game is relaxing: it has no time limit for beating a level and the music is relaxing. The only thing that makes not the game too relaxing is that you can’t undo your last move: you need to restart the whole level. Another relaxing thing is that the game plays a different sound every time you make a move.Now let’s talk about the game’s concept: the aim is to fill the canvas with the right colors in each cell of the table. To do so you have different colored ribbons to use in each row and column. To color a cell you need to overlap two ribbons, the last ribbon colors the cell. The game is pretty easy while playing a 2x2 size but become more tedious (impressive) with a wider size.(#) :Despite the great potential of that game, there is no new concept along the game. So after you’ve mastered dozens of levels from each size, there is not much to play with to be entertained unless doing the achievements perhaps."

Strata was fun for the first ~5 minutes while I still got to know the game mechanics and figured out how it works, but then it fell into a state where the levels got bigger and bigger, but I just kept repeating what I did before, again and again. Strata is very static and does not offer variation whatsoever. It is possible to complete a level in many different ways, but repeating a level over and over again just to find all possible solutions, from which many of those barely even differ doesn't sound very appealing to me.If, on the other hand, your goal is to find a game that simply keeps you busy while progressing through it with time, but doesnt really present any difficulty, you might find Strata interesting, but for me the things that Strata has to offer were not quite enough."

Strata is relaxing. Calm. Fun. It's a very simple game: draw lines on a grid, so every square is covered by the same coloured line. But here's the twist: the colour needs to be the same on the top. What starts off as a simple, easy game becomes a mind-boggling addictive puzzle. I could spend the same amount of time into Counter-Strike as i could with Strata. It's that good. Soon, you'll be matching up lines everywhere!But gameplay isn't the only thing. Strata is beautifully designed, with clean, neat, paper-like formatting that is both relaxing to the eye and wonderfully complex. In addition, the sound is well done. Timing right with the game, it eases you straight into a position of comfortability and easy-mindedness.Beware! This game most certainly isn't Borderlands 2, but it is well worth 3.99 (2.99 on sale), for a relaxing puzzle game that you can play for hours on end. Just remember to take breaks once in a while."

It starts as a pleasant casual game in that you can just walk away from it an any time and it's out of your head in a nanosecond, but while you're playing it.But....A possible criticism is the change in difficulty curve every time your square increases in size. There's a large jump between 3x3 puzzles and 4x4 ones and the further one progresses the less casual it becomes and the more concentration is needed. Strata stops being so casual and becomes fiendish once you're sucked in unless you use the hints I guess. But I'm not a fan of just following instructions."

The music is minimalist but peaceful. You don't have to play from start the finish you can freely choose which chapter you want to play but keep in mind they do become more elaborate and complicated as you go.

For $3.99, this game gives you a crapton to work with.My only complaint is that after playing the 5x5 puzzles for awhile you will start to feel it, and I mean feel some sort of brain exhaustion.

Each little action results in relaxed musical riffs which set a peaceful tone.

And there's really no way to lose or fail, only different levels of winning (i.e. perfect score or using a couple hints/undos), so the game won't frustrate or stress you as some puzzle games might.That being said, the menu can sometimes glitch when you're trying to navigate it, leaving you stuck at a certain puzzle list. It's nothing that can't be solved by ctrl-alt-deleting your way out and relaunching the game, though. It also lacks a volume control beyond ""sound on/off"", which can be solved by adjusting the system volume instead of the game volume.

The catch is that the colour of the square you're covering needs to be the same colour as the ribbon on the topmost layer.  Some way somehow using a premise this simple, Gravek has found a way to take the best features of puzzle games and combine them all into one.Strata is very relaxing:  I'm not sure if it's the music (you hear a piano cord play each time you roll out a ribbion and a gentle tune when you finish a puzzle).Strata is challenging: You'll find yourself thinking 5 moves ahead in multiple directions and, if you're a perfectionist like me, will find yourself restarting to solve the puzzles perfectly.Strata is fun: You can play a few puzzles right quick during a break, or you can go after an entire set of puzzles - depending upon time constaints and enjoy yourself either way.Strata is addictive: You find yourself coming back for more due to the three previously mentioned attributes.So why not pick it up?

There are a LOT of puzzles in this collection so you're definitely getting your money's worth. Some replayability too since you'll want to go back and try to 'perfect' some of the puzzles, i.e. complete a puzzle without using the Undo command at all.Music is ambient with some piano notes that dynamically highlight your moves. Nothing special but sets the mood nicely."

The concept is simple, layer the strips so the colour indicated in the square below is lain on top. The resultant puzzles are deviously difficult at times but the ability to quickly retrace your steps or, even, restart the problem makes sure the challenge never becomes frustrating. The visuals are simple, yet lovely and the sound design is perfectly done."

One must figure out not only which colored ribbons go where, but also in what order. For the price, this is a wonderful game to get if you want to pass the time and/or are into puzzle games. The music in the game is very beautiful and calming, and the shapes and colors really are nice to look at. I have been enjoying it so far, and I think you will too!"

You're the friend people go to when they need knots untangled or Rubix cubes solved;b. you like games like Lynec. you like sophisticated color palettesd. you like simple but soothing music for your background in puzzle gamesore. any/all of the aboveMy only criticism is that sometimes it doesn't seem to register that I'm clicking on a ribbon box - takes several tries to activate it. A blemish on an otherwise well-crafted game; might be a Mac bug, or might be something in my system, though I've yet to have any similar problems in any other game, which is what leads me to believe it's the fault of Strata, not mybabylaptop. That aside, well worth the money and quite enjoyable."

,Not Recommended,286380,22864847,"Posted: 8 May, 2016",all,McGibbslap,"The good:I like the concept of the puzzles.  It's unique, and does take a little time to think through.  Subtly a memory puzzle at times.  Very consistent, which can be tricky to make in a puzzle game.  The presentation is also generally quite pretty, and the music is nice and relaxing, and each move you make sounds rather musical as well so that's nice.The bad:Repetitive. No surprises here whatsoever, and once you come up with a strategy for the early puzzles every other one works exactly the same way.  I like the puzzle idea but now I feel like I've done as many of them as I'd ever want to.  Game awards a crown for a ""perfect"" score, which just means no undos - this could benefit from some kind of extra challenges, I'd say by taking advantage of the multiple solutions each puzzle has in its current form.  Game feels meant for a touchscreen, and I wouldn't want to play it with a mouse.  Also, no indication on a puzzle screen how many more puzzles are left in the set - I've taken to tallying them just so I know how far I have left.The ugly:While I've never had much issue with the gameplay (aside from what I think is fat fingers on my part but I could be wrong), the interface is bugged to hell.  Sometimes I'll exit a puzzle set (seems to happen when I exit one without completing it all the way) and the puzzle set select screens bug out and overlay on top of each other and navigation becomes impossible.  When you complete a level and all the ribbons slide away, the two on the bottom don't quite make it all the way off the top of the screen before blinking out, implying that the game was never really intended for a landscape view (and really, the left and right 1/3 of the screen is almost empty the entire game).  Most damning, the achievements for completing and perfecting an entire puzzle set trigger on completing and perfecting the FIRST puzzle in a set, meaning you can get 14/24 achievements from playing a tiny fraction of the available puzzles.Verdict:I do not recommend spending more than$1.00for this game."

While it is quite challenging in the beginning to get acqainted with the rules and the first couple of puzzles are not necessarilly easy to solve without undoing moves, it was so much fun to wrap your mind around the basic approach to solving all the puzzles perfectly. With this approach solving the 300+ puzzles became sort of meditative ... just my kind of thing, especially with the simplistic yet very ambient sounds.A definite recommendation for all puzzle lovers!"
