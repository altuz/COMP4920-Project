I played it a couple times before ever getting Steam and then, once I became a Steam addict, I bought this game for the cards. And played it again. And now I'm playing it for the fourth time. Yes, it's really that good. If you're a hidden object fan, you should definitely check this out."
,Recommended,286500,11166144,"Posted: 10 July, 2014",all,BridgetFisher,"Whats behind 1000 doors?  Good voiceacting with lots of spooky stories because you play the super spook detective Kate Reed!  The hidden object puzzles are real creative, instead of looking like a flea market threw up they fit the scenery for item hunting.  There is a hint button, and the puzzles arent too difficult, but you cant stuck because if a person wants to just throw their life away they can hit the ""skip"" button bringing shame and dishonor upon their family.    A helpful map indicates areas of interest because with 1000's of doors a map is kinda critical.  ooOOoooo the artwork is so nice in this game, everything looks so spooky and the objects in the Hidden Object Games are very crisp and clear so people shouldnt struggle to much.  This game plays like a book, its a very exciting page turner, where instead of just one story there are several stories to free the ghosts trapped here on earth.  The house can travel through space and time, so who knows where you might end up!There is a bonus game after the main game that lets you solve some additional mysteries.  More than just a mere room its a whole series of events, puzzles, and more hidden object games so this game is a good value at the price.(A concept art gallery would have been nice because the art is very good, seeing how it came to life would be nice.)Rating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99"
,Recommended,286500,12799909,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,Awesome✌Weegee👌,"A great Hidden Object game. Remember those Highlights magazines or I Spy books as a kid? Its kind of like those, but throw in some puzzles too. Its nothing too hard though. So if you are looking for adventure or a challenge I'd say look elsewhere for this is for those who enjoy the journey and story and its not how fast you can get through to the end. What it is, is simple problem solving and a whole lot of finding things that are hidden beyond others.To put it simple it's a Point & Click. You go about the house pointing and clicking, sometimes ""dragging"" (rarely). Most doors and objects of intrest are locked. Sometimes you can go and find the key, other times you play a mini Hidden Object game (which you can hop in & out of fairly easily without losing what you found so far, which is a plus). Upon completing the mini HO game you are always awarded a object that you will need (its worth noting: usually the object awarded in question is one of the objects found in the mini game). Aside from the hidden objects sprawled about the house, there is a great deal of puzzles that must be solved to obtain other items of intrest. Also there is a tie-in with ghosts and such; you help ghosts sovle mysteries based upon themselves. In doing so, you resolve their need to be at peace.Such is how this game is played. I find it soothing. Relaxing. A quaint little title (or not so little, but still) It's not an adventure, its an experience. And I enjoy it.This game gets a ""Yes"" from Awsome Weegee."

I don't know why, but the HOGs seem much more difficult than the ones in other games.  Plus, the ""go fetch"" puzzles needed to progress through the game seem much ""deeper"" than I've run into (some run from almost the beginning areas of the game to near the end).  Also, this is my first HOG without Achievements.  I expected not to like that.  But, it turns out to be more rewarding to just play the game instead of worrying if some stray mouse click or publisher design decision will lock me out of an Achievement until I make a second run through the game.As far as mild negatives:- the ""story"" feels like it's picking up in the middle (perhaps this is a sequel?),- there are two or three instances where an object you've found is not the object you're looking for (i.e., you need a lantern, but the one you've found isn't the right one).- the HOGs all contain objects that are hidden, but they're not color-coded as being hidden (objects that have to be manipulated or are physically hidden are textually red, but those that are in a container that just needs to be looked into are textually black).Other than that, it's pretty much standard HOG fare:  decent graphics, acceptable voice acting, tolerable story.  I got about 7.3 hours of game play out of the main game, and an additional 2.3 hours out of the Bonus Chapter (totaling 9.6 hours).  So, I'd say the list price is pretty close to being worth it.  But, as usual, look for a deal (right now, there's a Sinister Stories Bundle (that includes this game) that costs less than just the list price of this one game).  Recommended."
,Recommended,286500,26124581,"Posted: 19 October, 2016",all,Taylorgg12,This is one of the longer hidden object games that I have played. It's the first game in the series of House of 1000 doors. I really enjoyed the gameplay of this one. The puzzles and story all interconnected in a really nice way. I liked that the items were easier to find but the puzzles were still challenging enough not to be boring. I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy hidden object games or simply like games that have an intriguing story. I know that I for one will be continuing to play the rest of the series as they are released.

""The Palm of Zoroaster"" being the fourth.  If interested the other two can be found on Big Fish Games (yes, shamelss plug there, and hopefully I will not be banned).  This game is layered with an overall mystery storyline running above the ""adventure"" cases.  It is engaging, fun, intuitive, and easy to play. (All Big Fish collector's editions include strategy guides, bonus features, and extra chapters, so well worth the money spent.) One of things I like best about this particular HO game is trying to figure out where all the inventory items go.  Some items get picked and used later in a different unrelated ""adventure"" chapter, while others stay with the player for nearly the entire game and act as red herrings or McGuffins throughout.  Some of the puzzles at the start of the game are unsolvable and can only to be solved as the game progresses or near the end.  It tests the memory and creates ""ah-ha"" moments throughout the game as ""Oh that is where that item goes"" and ""Oh this is what I need to solve that puzzle"".  Of course the end is always satisfying (at least for me).  The ""boss"" (who or whatever it is) is easy to ""defeat"" and the overall storyline mystery is solved conclusively.  Truly enjoyed this game."

,Recommended,286500,12166653,"Posted: 20 September, 2014",all,Mad Scientist,"I did not enjoy this game as much as I've enjoyed other Hidden Objects games.  Partially this was a matter of game mechanics.  (For example, hiding objects inside of objects, or having to repair or transform them for them to 'count' for your search.  Half the time this was figuring out the hotspots within the puzzle screen, and less about actually seeing a hidden pattern inside of a larger picture.)[Update:  I recommend other users play this on 'Casual' difficulty setting, as this will minimize the interface level issues.]However, I really did get into the whole idea of the House of 1000 Doors itself.  That part tying the whole game together across space/time/afterlife was very interesting.There were aspects of the quest/story that just went ... nowhere.  (i.e. What are the Beyond Objects for, and why can't I see my progres, or lack thereof, anywhere within the game interface?)  The original game ramps you up to make an interesting choice, and then suddenly ENDS ... without actually giving you an oppurtunity to choose your final outcome at all!However, I did really enjoy the Collectors Edition content.  (Extra Chapter/Myster to solve, Strategy Guide included with game, and Wallpapers, etc.)I recommend the original game at 3/5 Stars, but I'll give it an extra star with the Strategy Guide, etc. contect included.  It was enjoyable, and I did play it all the way through, but it was not compelling!  I was slightly disappointed, even for a casual/hidden objects genre game.Final Rating:  4/5 Stars  (With Collectors Edition content bonus)Value for price?  I think this is worth the $10, but this is definitely a game I'd recommend if you can catch it during a Steam Sale.Update:  I did NOT consider the value of the Steam Collectible Card drops when I originally reviewed this.  If you merely trade them away for cash in your Steam Wallet, these are worth $1-$3, each [at the time I sold mine].  Expect up to 3 to drop while you play this game.  (Theoretically, this game pays for itself, that way.)"

As an adult, I found no challege, nor was the story interesting enough or necessary for me to really pay any attention to it (I skipped all cut scenes and had no trouble finishing the game).  That said, I'm recommending it because it is what it is--a light, casual, pixel-hunting game. It's an easy way to burn a few hours, and it's the kind of game you can play while watching TV."

It wasn't just the plot, which was interesting, but the mechanics made sense in a way that is beyond most point and click games. There's still a level of contrivance, but there's very little finding the needed items in really nonsensical places. I already played through the second one, too, and hope the rest of the games in this series make it over to Steam eventually."

I love the rich use of colors and charactors. The dark, almost Halloween vibe to it works for me.  Voice overs can bit very cheesy at times (most times). Also, there will be a few glitches. There is ALOT of time wasted having to travel to different parts over and over again to achieve goals. This can be annoying. Over all, if it's on sale and you love HOG's, go for it.

76561198220519669,Recommended,286500,32314166,Posted: 10 June,all,EndarkCuli,"The majority of Hidden Object games are pretty formulaic: make some progress, reach a dead end, find a spot where you look for a variety of items in a cluttered but well-drawn image, use at least one of the items to solve a puzzle, and repeat until you win the game. It's a casual experience that still feels rather rewarding at times, but for those that aren't a fan of the genre, why choose House of 1000 Doors over others? To start with, this game has a variety of environments to keep things interesting instead of just being stuck in a spooky house, thanks to the Doors (though there's not actually 1000 of them in this game). The plot has some supernatural elements, but doesn't feature any imagery that might scare younger players away. And the puzzles, while not all that challenging (especially if you choose to use hints), were still engaging enough to hold my interest.  The default price is a tad high, even for a ""Collector's Edition"", and especially since this game AND two of its sequels can be found in the ""House of Snark 6-in-1 Bundle"" (though there may be some quality issues and glitches with that pack).  But if you want only a single game to see if Hidden Object titles appeal to you, or just a casual experience you can play at a pace of your own choosing, then I think that Family Secrets might appeal to you."

,Recommended,286500,12784206,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,Usagi,"A mysterious house of secrets appears and disappears at random locations with little warning, an author with writer’s block finds herself in its walls searching for clues about her family and a host ofghosts are begging for help. If this sounds interesting to you then it’s time for you to playHouse of a 1,000 Doors: Family Secrets! Step into the shoes of Kate Reed as she visits the house to clear the good name of one of her ancestors, only to be introduced to life-altering supernatural experiences. It’s up to Kate to help the residents of the house and make her way out before she becomes one herself.The story starts you off by saying Kate has to go to the house to clear the name of her ancestor, Margaret Fox; however, most of the game is spent instead helping ghosts and residents of the house. Many of the ghosts you help have met tragic ends and can’t pass on without your aid. Despite having nothing to do with the main reason you went to the house, I found each story very interesting as well as the characters you meet. In fact, the game is full of a large cast of colorful folk except for Kate; despite being the protagonist,Kate is very dry and unrelatable. Another issue I had with the story is that it isn’t really given a proper wrap up until the bonus chapter. The entire main game is spent helping others with little to no mention of Margaret Fox until the epilogue and you don’t get to know more about her until the bonus chapter which is odd for a game about “family secrets.” If you’re playing a version of the game without the bonus chapter the story might even seem incomplete to you. The story of the main game seems more about Kate proving to Gabriel, the mysterious caretaker of the house, that she has what it takes to join the residents and live there permanently.Minor complaints aside, the story is well done and fun. The game is also a very solid hidden object title, offering many scenes as well as some mini games. Most scenes will be played twice, however some get hit three times and a certain one even four or five thanks to the bonus chapter. I personallydislike when a hidden object scene is used more than twice, you get too used to it and where the objects are. Another thing I disliked was the lack of a map; this game was very backtrack heavy and it was time consuming and slightly irritating without a map. Aside from those two points, I highly enjoyed the game. Voice acting wasn’t bad and the music was nice as well though the game could have used a bit more variety in that department.A game so good I played it twice, a good addition to your collection of hidden object games. The length is solid, about four hours with the bonus chapter and it isn’t too difficult. Thepuzzles ranged from easy to moderateusually but there are no achievements so if you’re ever stuck you can always skip. There also semi-hidden items called “beyond objects” to find around the game, you can try to collect them all for fun. The game does have trading cards, however, so if you’re a collector of badges you’re in luck.House of 1,000 Doors: Family Secretsisn’t perfect but it’s an overall good experience that I recommend giving a try.Lunar Productions"

(And of course this also means that a significant portion of the game is nothing but backtracking, especially in the bonus chapter.)As for the story, it can be considered a really high point or a mediocre one. The voice acting (except for the child actor) is good, and the plot is a series of well-written short ghost stories.

,Recommended,286500,14998245,"Posted: 21 March, 2015",all,shiaakuma,"This is a good buy for fans of the combination puzzle/HO genre.  The story is engaging; it's almost styled like an anthology with a number of substories scattered throughout the main story.  As such, the plot doesn't drag on forever since you're moving from one plot to the next as you help each spirit find rest.Puzzles are moderately challenging.  Hidden object scenes are also moderately challenging.  Veterans to this game type will have no issues with the puzzles but they won't blow right through them either.There is a convenient skip function for puzzles that are tedious or if you get stuck.There is also a convenient location jump so you can essentially teleport yourself anywhere that you've already been.  This is where some games get extremely tiresome, with endless back-and-forth travel, but with the jump feature (which has no cooldown and can be used over and over) the game avoids that mindless ""travel for eighteen screens to get an item and then backtrack another twenty screens to use it"" problem that can ruin the experience.I clocked in at around five hours of gameplay including the bonus chapter.  This makes the game one of the longer HO/puzzle games that I've played, especially recently, and makes the ten dollar price tag less painful; however, I tend to feel that the average price of these games is generally too high for the amount of gameplay (even with a longer game), so I personally recommend waiting for a half-off sale or a bundle.  This one is part of a bundle that includes some other quality games and is occasionally marked WAY down; that's a perfect time to stock up!"

It's a perfect mix of casual puzzles, ""find the object"" games and a nice and simple background story. The graphics are simply amazing and the atmosphere is even better. You'll find yourself in this huge ghost house (and if you're wondering, no, it doesen't have 1000 doors. just a dozen) hunting for clues and speaking with your friendly ghost hosts. Everything just flow smooth and simple, in the right place.Let me tell you, it'a a beautifully crafted product that will keep you entertained and relaxed between your super meat boy sessions.thumbs up!!!"

I enjoy walk through puzzle games, and this was entertaining, challenging at times, and fun all the time!I really loved the hint system. You go into a puzzle game swearing you won't need/want hints, but sometimes you're just stuck. The hint system simply points you in the direction of the correct room (then once in the room, to the correct area). I was able to just confirm I was in the right part of the house, and then able to (finally) figure out the answer on my own. A few times I was in the completely wrong part of the house, so it saved me from wasting anymore time without giving away the answer."
76561198271914994,Recommended,286500,24104032,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,ariannadiangelo,"I really recommend this game (along with the rest of the House of 1000 Doors games, which only seem to improve as the series goes on)! Though the voice acting can be a bit wonky/robotic at times, I think the main plot point of this game (there is a house that appears at certain places/times because there are souls who haven't found peace) is intriguing and super interesting. I love the visuals, the music is amazing, and while you're kind of alone with your thoughts most of the time, I think it really adds to how melancholic and sad this game truly is. It has a lot of the basics of a HOG but also pairs it with a fascinating and immersive storyline.I do have two complaints, though:1. Functional fixedness in this game drives me CRAZY. I know how ridiculous this sounds, but sometimes the game requires a very specific object for a task when you already have something in your inventory that could just as easily complete what needs to be done (for example, using a knife vs scissors to cut something). I know it's because the game is super expansive and if you could complete every task using a select few objects, it would be boring, but it still can be irritating at times.2. This seems to be a pattern with most of the games this company puts out, but the ending is extremely rushed. Not only that, but the last door/portal you enter is extremely out of place in comparison to the other storylines. I don't know what it is about this company and their need to insert magic/demons/weird sci-fi elements ONLY at the tail-end of a great story, but that's what happens here, and it's a little sad, because the rest of the storylines are so beautifully thought out. The fourth and final portal is so short in comparison it feels tacked on.That being said, if you purchase the CE, there is a phenomenal additional chapter to play which totally (IMO) makes up for the quickness of the final door. You get to learn more about Kate's family/why and how she's tied to the House (and also how it works), and it's on par with the melancholy of the earlier plotlines.I really enjoyed this game and really recommend it, simply because the storylines are so fascinating (if you ignore when they randomly add magical elements), it has a longer gameplay than most HOG, and the environments are expansive and beautifully rendered."

It wasn't about finding hidden objects, which btw was my favorite part, but it had actual puzzles that all interconnect with the story. Don't worry about it being too casual since you can make it as easy or as hard as you want it to be. In the end it was a nice change of pace where it's all about the clicking and less about watching cutscenes."

It clearly has a lot more love gone into it. The lore is much better (though that's not a high bar to clear) and the puzzles are surprisingly not annoying.Still some bad things about it would be the voice acting and the some of the hidden object challenges. Twice it happened to me to find 2 objects that could be described by the same name, and that's a huge no no in these types of games. I also took a point off for not giving the player a choice on the ending, even though it was building up to be a choice.Other than those, all and all, not bad. I would recommend."

(Except for the bit where there weren't actually a thousand doors.  That would've been pretty awesome, though I guess more like a room escape game than a hidden object one.  Which is a genre-smush I didn't know I wanted until I just wrote that sentance, but wow.  Does it exist?  If it does, someone let me know!)Plots were terrible, but because there was a bunch of sub-plots tying into an overarching big plot, they didn't seem so bad - I mean, some things were are-you-SERIOUS?? level dumb, but that's pretty normal for the genre, so I can't dock it too much for that.  A few things that didn't come up AT ALL in the cutscenes but were actual vital parts of the plot, which you could only find out by reading the diary, though.  Made things kiiiinda confusing at times.  Devs, even if you're not going to invest in quality writing, just... don't do that.  It's a terrible mood.Keyword choices were also pretty good!  There were a few things I was ???? about that I think were just dialect differences, and a few reaaaally obscure terms (one I ended up googling, and the fourth or fifth result was a walkthrough for the game, soooo yeah, obscure), but there weren't any mistranslations or coding errors, which puts it a couple of steps above most games in the genre I've played.  There was one instance of having two things in a HO scene which were classified as $keyword, and only one counted, though.  That was pretty frustrating.Minigames were pretty good; nothing amazing, but nothing bad, just solid little puzzles.  Art was nice, VAing - well, terrible, but again, that's not unusual. A few places where I wasn't sure what to do next, but there was a map with action-avaliable highlighting and warping, so I could usually figure it out before too long.  There were a couple of places where you had to use a specific tool even though you had something else that would actually be better for it, or would work equally as well (pots of water being just as good to put out a fire as a bucket of water, for example), which was annoying but, again, pretty normal (and probably really hard to code differently unless you completely redesgined the entire game, to be fair).Conclusion: solid game of its genre!"
