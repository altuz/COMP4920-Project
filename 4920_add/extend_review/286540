With such excellent visuals no puzzle gaming fan should be dissuaded by this.  There is a guide to help if you get stuck, or just skip the puzzle.  The only puzzle that seemed to be guesswork was the seasons puzzle shown in the screenshot, there is a shoe, and an umbrella, I guess those are only needed during certain seasons?(For summer, the shoe coulda been a flip-flop. While for Fall, the umbrella coulda been anything like a pile of leaves. What is that umbrella even for in the fall?)While solving puzzles be on the look out for little creatures that tell their own bonus story in the snoopedia of the hard life of living in a fantasy paradise.  We need more games on this level of awesome, to appeal to the masses those puzzles need to be toned down to more human levels outside the realm of needing to be an Einstein.  Noone wants to bring shame and dishonor upon their family by resorting to the use of the *gulp* skip button on a clever puzzle.Loses one point because you cant replay the game with the same profile, you have to delete your profile or create a new one to play it again losing your snoopedia progress.

It is one of the most visually stunning hidden object games out there. I was excited everytime I accessed a new area - every scene is beautiful. The characters and creatures look great. Some of the animals are the cutest I've seen. Voice acting is better than average for this genre. The music is lovely AND you have access to all the songs since this is the collector's edition. The puzzles range from very easy to ""ack, this is hurting my brain"" but you can skip any of them, if you so desire. The length of Nearwood, especially with the bonus game, is longer than most hidden object games. And there is a very cool ""boss battle"" that most puzzle games lack. I do have to warn you, the hidden object aspect of the game is limited and when you hit them, you're only searching for specific item parts. However, the game is SO good that the lack of ""normal"" hidden object areas didn't bother me in the least. I really could go on and on about how much I enjoyed playing this. I'll just finish with - I highly recommend it.  :)"

It also indicates something of interest can be done at certain location.  Please note that the map isn't given immediately when the game started. Also, the teleportation amulet automatically recharges itself after being used.Most of the hidden object scenes consists of fragment items, placing items back. Some of them do require little or no interaction.Most of the game's puzzles are rather easy to solve without much difficulty. For most of these puzzles there's a reset button. However, there's definitely a skip button, for all of the puzzles. These two features are only present in ""Casual"" game difficulty mode.There are small creatures collectibles in the game called Snoop-Sees. They're scattered throughout the game.Since this is a collector's edition game, there's a bonus chapter, but it can be unlocked only after the main story of the game's completed.

Recently i haven't really been feeling the long and time consuming games, yet this one is somewhere around the middle. It wasn't too long and it wasn't too short. I managed to get around 4 and a half hours of play time out of it. Including the bonus chapter at the end.The story is decent, i particularly like the fantasy type world you stumble into. It's nothing too enthralling but it's definitely a decent play and helps it stand out slightly from all the other HOGs.I've been playing quite a few recently and this is one of the better ones i think.The item finding itself is a little odd in this one. It's not the usual 'list' kind of thing. It was more so shorter item-finding scenes where you are looking for ten or so outlined shapes rather then a long list of named objects. It's something a little different I guess but i found it quite odd.It also doesn't feel like there is actually many item-finding scenes in this game. In ways i liked it, they focused a tad more on the story and i guess it's always good that the game isn't entirely dependent on that factor of the game. But i personally would have enjoyed it a little more if they were a little more frequent. As i quite like the item-finding side to HOGs.The voicing acting, art and puzzles are all pretty standard as far as HOGs go really. As in, the voice acting is always that tad bit cheesy, the art is always quite nice and the puzzles are always fairly similar.None the less, i enjoyed it. As these kind of games are great for few hour time killers.When it comes to this genre of game, i think all positive reviews tend to be very similar. It's just usually the bad ones that differentiate and usually for good reason.For a HOG to be bad they must bereallybad.*Cough* Amazing Adventures Around The World *Cough*Excuse me.All in all, this is another decent hidden object game for the collection, i'd definitely recommend this one.TL;DR : Another decent HOG, pretty standard but stands out a little from the rest with it's fantasy setting."

Yes there are hidden objects to find but you are finding shapes not really items. And what hidden object puzzles there are, are few and far between. (sorry for the cliche). On the postive side what H.O,s there are, are fair. They use no tricks like turning off the lights or giving you a time clock. And the object are usually well placed and not obscured. I played on HO game where the object was 75% covered by anohter object.However, this is a beautiful game to look at and play.  The music is good. The voice acting is better than normal and they have some nice NON-hidden object puzzles thrown into the game. In particular the last puzzle in the bonus game has, believe it or not, a boss fight. Of the puzzle variety. The main game's story is okay as long as you don't ponder its ramifications.Bottom line, a great game to play between or during your hardcore games."

The excellent voice acting and the highly detailed, absolutely stunning painted graphics all promise to enchant you as soon as you hit the Play button. Sadly this beauty is skin deep.The story is as stock as it gets: you arrive in a clichéd fairy land tortured by a clichéd zero-dimensional evil to find a clichéd relic which can deal with this menace. Same in the bonus chapter with an added cartoonish over-the-top villain monologue.The puzzles and fragmented object scenes offer a great variety both in types and difficulty, but there are a few questionable design choices. For example the fast travel option needs to be recharged, making the map useless; and the final (match-three) puzzle is actually based on sheer luck with the promise of many retries.Still, Nearwood is an astonishingly gorgeous game that is worth to be played just for the looks alone. Just don’t expect much more from it."

It's very polished and nicely done - top of its class, honestly. Really adorable fairy tale creatures top my list of favorites but the art is generally just lovely and the world the devs created is enjoyable. The voice acting is good, the soundtrack is very pleasant, and the story isn't half bad. My only complaint is that some of the puzzles were annoying and tedious but it's easy enough to skip them if you get frustrated.So:Pros:+ Artwork+ Environment+ Voice acting+ SoundtrackCons:- Puzzles aren't great (but the hidden objects and point & click aspects make up for it)- There was often a few seconds of lag when moving from scene to scene, but not enough to be a gamebreaker by any means"

76561198036338106,Recommended,286540,13473183,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,smelliga,"I played through this game twice, once for story and once for completion.It is not actually a HOG in the traditional sense; it is an extremely casual point-and-click adventure that happens to mix in a handful of HOG-like elements.Gameplay consists of:1. Object-based puzzles (find an object, then use it where it's needed).2. Mini-games that utilize rotating discs, matching, pattern recognition, mazes, and other simple challenges.3. FROG puzzles (fractured object I-spy puzzles).4. Recipes (combine several components together to create a new item).5. A global I-spy puzzle that requires you to spot 111 ""Snoop-see"" creatures across both the main game and bonus mission in order to unlock pages of a book.This game did several things right.  The artwork is beautiful (almost Jim Henson-esque), the mini-games are fresh and creative, the adventure puzzles are intuitive, the music and voice-acting are decent, and the FROG puzzles are challenging but not frustrating.It is a good gateway game for those new to the genre.  They do a great job of providing constructive feedback to players, and they include both a hint system and a complete walkthrough (including Snoop-see locations) for anyone who is struggling.  Additionally, on easier difficulties, the game map shows points of interest, and allows you to teleport to any screen.  As an extra little bone to players, the pages unlocked by the Snoop-see hunt provide visual clues to the game's puzzle solutions.I would have liked them to have a stronger story hook, and to use the dialogue more effectively (the start of the game is especially slogged down with cutscenes).  I also would have liked a bit more variety in the object-based puzzles; you can only collect so many keys, handles, triangles, and seals before it starts to feel repetitious.Another thing that bugged me was the need for precision when using objects.  If you don't interact with the right hot spot, the puzzle will not recognize the required solution.One special note: players who are colour-blind will have difficulty with the mini-games, as many of them require colour recognition to solve.  This is a major concern because the mini-games are a rather large component of the gameplay.Overall, I would give this game a 7/10.  It was more child-like than I expected, and there weren't really any true HOG puzzles, but the art was pretty and the mini-games were fun.  It is a decent casual game to waste a few hours with, although I wish I had earned a few steam playing cards or achievements for playing."

Hidden object scenes were both a little too easy and a little too few in number, but they were enjoyable.Voice acting was perfectly fine; nothing stellar but nothing that made me want to gouge my eardrums out either, which is important to me in any game where I have to listen to people talk at all.I clocked in at around three and a half hours of gameplay including the bonus content.  It's about average for this kind of game.  I never feel like a ten dollar price tag is quite fair for that though, though, so I recommend waiting for a sale (as I do for most of these games, honestly).Short version: this is totally worth it if you're a fan of the genre but consider holding out for a half-price sale."

The HOGs had a really nice amount of variety, themed goals, and beautiful art. No cut-and-clip photos here!  The other puzzles ran a nice gamut of difficulties, and this game went for the gusto with having actual 'boss battle' puzzles!If I was to have any complaint, it would be on how they animated faces for this. It worked overall, but there'd be moments when characters would look downright uncanny or unintentionally creepy. I think it would have worked better if instead of mapping a whole face over a 3d model, they had 'layered' the portions of the face to come up with a more woodcut or conventional sort of animation. As it is the faces do distort weirdly a time or two.But that's just one nitpick about an otherwise utterly gorgeous game. This is well worth the cost - happy hunting!"

I wished that some of them got more use, whether appearing later on in the game with another need/puzzle or even just a quick story scene.+/- I found the ending to come at a reasonable point but it could be viewed as abrupt.Gameplay:- I played on expert difficulty as I don't like the flashy help and hints, but that was a big mistake and wholly not recommended for 1st playthroughs as many interactive areas are too hidden and not easily recognizable. So unless you want to waste energy clicking everywhere on the screen then I'd recommend at most the 2nd difficulty. I didn't see an option to change it mid-game so I continued on, so a lot of my time was spent going back and forth trying to find the last item of a set needed to progress and tapping like mad (I only resorted to using the in-game guide once towards the end and I was disgusted at how unobvious the spot was).+/- Some puzzles were a complete pushover while others had more a involved challenge. But as others have said, the rules and need of some of them aren't immediately clear, to which the prospect of figuring out on your own will either excite or frustrate you (you're helper Fey does pop up with a ""?"" button which I assume will explain things but I never bothered with it).+ Items found are only needed in areas 1 - 3 areas away so no crazy backtracking.- I played on a tablet pc, which did work well, but sometimes trying to use an item on the correct area wouldn't register correctly and needed a few extra tries. I'm not sure if the tablet touch had something to do with it or there were very specific spots that needed to be hit but it was annoying.- Other than a couple of mixing puzzles, there's no manipulation of items. I would've liked to have seen some combining and such things.Extras:+ Promo art and soundtrack and others.

Technically, the game is pretty good:  good graphics and excellent voice acting are the big positives.  For minor negatives, there were a couple of puzzles with issues in the main game.  At one point, you have to set a clock.  But, unless I missed something, there's nothing that tells you what to set it to.  Looking at the Guide and some walkthroughs gives an answer.  But, the hints are given for a 12 hour clock and the clock is a 24 hour one.  Yet, the answer works.  Then there's a set of constellations you're supposed to show.  There's no indication anywhere what the constellations are supposed to look like.  So, you're just randomly rotating stars until something takes.The big problem, though,  is the intended audience.  The story is written for children.  Young children.  Most of the puzzles are simple enough for them.  But, there are several puzzles that are hard.  Really hard.  So, if you play the game with your child, it'll be fine most of the time.  But, at other times, it'll be too hard.  If you play it by yourself (as an adult), the silly story will irritate you, the simple puzzles might bore you, and the difficult ones might frustrate you.  So, again, there's an audience mis-match.I got a total of 5.5 hours out of the game (4.2 hours in the main game and another 1.3 hours in the bonus chapter).  So, by my measure, the game is a bit overpriced at it's current list price of about $10."

I wish it could be even longer, because the scenes were beautiful and little puzzles were really nice. I really like beautiful games, but usually I don't concentrate on plots so much, like here.  There was some weard things you have to do in the game, which I didn't understand, but you have to remember it's fantasy game, so... Overall this game is good, it won't take so long to play through."

Otherwise, great HOG."

The story is so uninteresting and boring it's not even worth mentioning. Game actions are meh - too many keys and puzzle pieces to collect, too many ""put magic item in magic slot"" places. And like Brink of Consciousness series, the items are randomly scattered all over the world so you have to constantly run back and forth trying to find a spot to use them, there is hardly any logic in it.Travelling between the screens is pretty slow, I haven't seen such long loading times in any other game in this genre. And for some reason the map travel is limited, after you use it you have to wait for it to recharge or travel manually between the screens. I don't understand how anyone could think this is a good idea.Yet I'm giving it a positive rating. Why? Well, graphics are nice and the fairy tale atmosphere is cute. Hidden-object scenes are different this time, the objects are not specified by names but by outlines, and I liked this change. And the game contains several original and quite challenging minigames, I'm glad they didn't recycle the same minigames over again like some other games do."

I got in the Sinister Stories bundle so I feel compelled to judge it in comparison to the rest of the series, and in that regard, you could do better and worse. It's far from the best in the bundle but isn't bad like Shadows: Price for Our Sins. If you can only buy one game in the bundle, you should probably go for Alex Hunter or Brink of Conciousness, but if this is on sale and you have the both of them and want a game with a few good puzzles, you could do worse."

I found this game on sale for $2.50 so I thought I'd give it a try, since it had beautiful art. It's kind of like a point and click adventure story where you solve a variety of puzzles, put objects together, and help fix things to save this fairy tale style magical realm from an evil darkness that was unleashed when your character's father stopped time by accident when trying to save his wife from a deadly illness and ended up freezing himself and the time lords in the process. The story is a bit of a stretch, but it feels natural within the atmosphere in the game. There are hidden object game parts, but not many, there is a good variety of puzzles most of which are pretty easy and simple. Quite a few of them require trial and error, but really easy to figure out trial and error, if that makes sense. There was only two puzzles that I felt took me a while to figure out, and only one puzzle did I use one of my skips for, but mostly because I was tired and wanted to move on so I could go to bed at the time (lol).There is a timer so if it's taken you a certain amount of time to solve the puzzle it'll allow you to skip it except for the hidden object parts which the timer allows you a hint instead. If you don't want to use a skip but are stuck, on the bottom right hand corner of the screen there's a guide button that provides a walkthrough, so you can see just one step ahead to get your gears moving. But to be honest, 99% of the game is very simple. The sound and art is beautiful and relaxing and getting objectives completed feels satisfying even if it's not that difficult, and the entire mood and atmosphere of the game is what sells it IMO. I love it, it's a good refresher from all those frustrating competitive games. The voice acting isn't very good at all but it's listenable and to be honest I expect these games to have bad voice acting. My only regret is that the voice acting isn't bad enough to be hilarious, but it's not bad enough to really hate it so I guess that's fine too haha. Overall, it took me four and a half hours to complete the main chapter before I got to the bonus chapters. So it's pretty short, but for these games longer would probably mean it outstays its welcome. I'm not sure if it's worth the full price of $15 (if I remember that correctly) but I'm always hesitant to spend money on casual style games because I'm a terrible person. But it was more than worth the $2.50 and I highly enjoyed my playthrough, definitely more solid than many other games of this genre I've played in the past."

Normally I would say if you've played one you've played them all but there are exceptions. I would add this to the exceptions list. The graphics were lovely-a storybook fantasy illustration art style with a touch of steampunk tossed in. The voice acting was well done. The soundtrack was quite nice and is included in the Collector's Edition. The story wasn't mind-blowing but it was interesting enough to keep me amused til the end. Puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, with an interesting variety AND there were actually more puzzles than hidden object screens, which was a plus for me. All in all, a great game for the genre. I enjoyed it. My single complaint would be the lack of Steam cards/achievements, as there were many opportunities for them. 8/10"
