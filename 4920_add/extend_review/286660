It's a simple premise, and Avoid: Sensory Overload really isn't breaking any new ground. But what begins as a rather mediocre addition to the pile of retro-inspired games available on Steam quite rapidly develops into one of the toughest games in your library, and what's more, it's addictive. At advanced levels, the game's pace is breakneck, and the course is littered with pitfalls and obstacles. Leagues harder than comparable titles like Audiosurf, Avoid: Sensory Overload is a no B.S. test of skill and reaction time. Your average gamer probably won't make it through the Medium levels, and most of us probably won't make it through the Hard levels. Even if you're the kind of Ulillillia tier savant it takes to make it through Extreme difficulty, you can pile on a fresh challenge by playing the Endless mode for a randomly-generated infinite run. At the fair price of $5, Avoid: Sensory Overload scratches the itch for a simple game at both extremes: It's fun enough to pick up and play for a quick session, and difficult enough to provide a challenge in the long term."

It is definitely comparable to Super Hexagon(or the Impossible Game, etc) in terms of difficulty once you are finished with easy.  The difficulty curve gets steep and fast.  But at least until you get up to hard and extreme it's not unreasonably hard, just very unforgiving.I also warn against long play sittings: the visuals can induce nausea if you are sensitive to strobe lights and flashing colours.The music is electronic/trance/synth, so if you dislike that music style, I'd avoid this game.  But it is good music, but I will note that in playing the levels, the music gets incredibly repetitive quickly when it's the same 60 seconds of music for 8 levels(or more if you have to go through a level multiple times).I definitely recommend the game if it's on sale(as I purchased it).

Stay in school, kids.Actual Review:The Musiccanwear on you.There are 4 different Tracks to progress down, each with their own visual and musical themes.Each of those Tracks has 4 different Tiers (difficulties), each with 8 Levels;Each subsequent Level in a Tier adds to how far through the musical track you get through -Each Level within the Tiers is different from the last, though they appear to be static (i.e. you can memorize the layout).The different Tiers within the same Track have different Music to accompany them.Tracks:===Electronic: The advertised image is the Electronic track; the cylinder you're shooting through appears to surround a visualizer, reacting to the Music. Avoid sets of Orbs bouncing between two points.===Minimal: The obstacles pulse to the Music. Avoid Rival Ships that fly down the Track with you.===Laserdance: A pulsating corona within the center of the Track responds to the Music. The obstacles are the same color as the collectibles. Therefore, the only thing to ("")avoid("") is Sliding Platforms.===Synthrock: Another pulsating corona (though to a lesser extent). The Tracks are much more, er, angular (diagonally inclined). Avoid Spike Traps.Mind that these summaries are only from the first (and sometimes second) Tiers; I've no doubt that with each subsequent Tier, more obstacles and features will be implemented.You can customize the color scheme of your ship.You can play with keyboard, controller and even the mouse - the only controls are ""Move Left; Move Right.""Keyboard, of course, offers better responsiveness.Mouse seems to allow your ship to move slightly faster, at the loss of some precision.Have yet to try controller.There are different ("")power-ups("") to collect, such as a Shield that allows you to survive one collision, a ""Drop"" that lowers all obstacles in your line of sight, a [unknown] that fills the gaps in your path for a(n extremely) short period of time.

How strange.I was torn between this and Race the Sun.I don't regret my decision.(I got Race the Sun in a Bundle soon after; it is amazing too, in its own right - hardly comparable to Avoid, except in that you're flying down a track.)*EDIT*: Were it not for the (almost) assaulting visuals, I would argue that this game should've been called ""Muscle Memory Trainer."" It claims reflexes are necessary; I claimed ""you can memorize the layout [of the tracks].""False; your first several runs will be to get a feel for the tracks; your golden runs will be to put that muscle memory (which I guess could be called ""reflexes,"" at first) to use.This is not necessarily a criticism, I will keep coming back to the game when I'm pondering what other game to play.Just. Fair warning.Muscle Memory Trainer WHILE Avoid(ing) Sensory Overload.Also: There is an Endless Mode on each of the Tracks with different difficulty levels; Leaderboards.

,Recommended,286660,9857624,"Posted: 17 April, 2014",all,Apokaladle,"Overview: Avoid Sensory Overload is a really fun arcade dodging game, slightly reminiscent of titles like Race the Sun. You're speeding forwards at an ever-increasing rate, and you control your little ship and steer it around to collect score multipliers and powerups while avoiding walls and holes in the track.Accessibility: The easiest mode is very accessible to casual players, while the harder modes require lightning reflexes. There are a lot of flashing lights, so if you're sensitive to that then you might not want to pick it up. The controls are keyboard or gamepad, which is a bit of a shame as I'd love to play this with the mouse. They are rebindable though.Game modes: There are fixed levels, where you replay them to try and get perfect runs, but to me the real appeal of the game is the randomly-generated Endless Mode. Naturally for a game like this, there are leaderboards for all difficulty levels. There are also currently 3 ""themes"" as the devs put it, which play slightly differently and have different aesthetics.Graphics/Sound: The visuals are bright, bold, and striking. It's also got a lovely electronic soundtrack.Price: It's 4.99 right now, and it's got trading cards that are fairly high-valued at the moment if that makes a difference to you.All in all, a really nice little indie game that I think deserves a bit more exposure."

So it makes for a great time-waster with a simple enough gameplay, but even more challenging modes if you're in it to win it.Handling of the ships with a keyboard feels good and it's just as responsive as you'd imagine it, meaning you know when you've pressed the button to late and won't blame the game for lag.If you're prone to get headaches or easily feel nauseous, than it's probably not for you, but if you every wished to have an arcade machine with a simple ""get the ship from a to b without hitting stuff"" game in your own living room, well, that's the game for you.

,Recommended,286660,25849798,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,HudsonWolf,"In theory, Avoid is a pretty straightforward game. In practice,it's a lot of left and rightit's a mad and magnificent dash with a heavy dose of difficulty and a nice dash of variety.The difficulty ramps up nicely - for the first set of levels or so, you have the leisure to worry about collecting every multiplier powerup to finish the level with a perfect score. Gradually, that ideal fades into unfeasibility, and you're left with the simple goal of getting slightly farther on each attempt. It's plenty hard but far from impossible - in 7 hours I was able to complete everything through Hard and one set of Extreme levels (though I decided the rest were probably beyond my skill level). The ability to 'learn' each level over the course of many (many) tries is nice as it makes it rare to feel cheated - and if you'd rather focus on snap reaction than, uh, lethal reconaissance, there's an endless survival mode as well.The levels are divided into four different themes (scroll through those pictures at the top for a sense), each with its own set of level features and powerups. This does a nice job of keeping things fresh - the levels in each theme have a fairly well defined mechanical identity to go along with the visuals, keeping them distinct enough that it doesn't get boring over 128 levels despite the minimal nature of the game.One point worth mentioning is the controls - some other reviews have complained that you should be able to move exactly one square at a time. There's some merit to that - digital movement on an analog grid can feel pretty awkward at times - but this scheme is so much smoother than the alternative (especially on the synthrock levels with diagonal blocks) that it's absolutely the right decision for the game.Avoid takes a simple concept and executes it well - if you're up for some frenzied arcade action, give it a shot."

You move a ""ship"" around the screen, trying to avoid obstacles (usually blocks or pits, a few moving parts).Around you is a neon lighted strobing light tunnel and the course itself is only a few meters visible, building itself as you race along.What makes the game so interesting is the way the music meshes with the gameplay, the way you can, or rather must, lose yourself until there is nothing but the moving ship and the gradually appearing course.You don't have tothinkabout what you do, you just have toDOit. If you start to plan ahead, you'll likely to crash into a block.Minimal as the gameplay is, it has a soothing effect - youhaveto be calm to get good reactions, after all.The controls react instantly, and there is no need to familiarize yourself with the way the game is handled. You might need a few tries to get a feeling for how the ""ship"" reacts, but it doesn't seem to have any personality at all - you push the left key, it goes left. No delay, no sliding. Ideally it'll be as if it reacts to your thoughts.My only regret is that the music restarts when you die in endless mode. Since I die often, it means I don't get to hear the rest of it.I'm not entirely sure how much I think this game is worth. I bought it for 1.25 Euro, and I certainly don't regret spending that money.Would I have paid more? Might be. I don't know how much I'll end up playing it, but even if I didn't play it any more, I'd consider it money well spent.Unfortunately there is no demo version available for the PC, which IMO would be a good idea, since you can only experience the game by playing it - viewing a video dosn't tell you halfway enough."

If I had played this first, I wouldn't have bought it even on sale.I might not have even played enough to write a review, but it only takes a few minutes of playtime to know if I like a game or not, and this game is a definate dislike."

But I did find myself getting an almost high off the colors and movement, so if you're susceptable to such things, don't play for long periods. Otherwise, great game! The colors are the nice, the music is a nice mellow tone that goes well with the in-game environment. It's a bit of an irritant at times, but not so much that I regret buying it."

It's addicting because you think it's going to be easy, but honestly, it can be very tricky. It's amazing I still have any hair left ater wanting to pull it out because of frustration at that stupid hole I just fell into.Good news though. I finally beat my grandaughter's score. She's 11. Dang kids!"

76561198107093049,Recommended,286660,21198898,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,DeadZoneDevil,"Firstly I don't know why the record says 6.5 hours. I've easily hit 20+ since I bought it. I have gotten more than my money's worth for this title.I think how much you're into the 'navigate obstacles at high speeds' genre will largely determine whether you'll find this game worth your time and money. It's far from the best on offer, but it's solid in most respects and can make for many hours of weirld relaxing-yet-hectic fun provided you're willing to look over some issues.Firstly, the difficulty. It's unbalanced, and quite noticably so. These are the 4 difficulty settings, with what they actually feel like:Easy = Very EasyMedium = Very HardHard = ExtremeExtreme = Muscle Memory Master from HellYou will have quite a difficult time navigating the narrow pathways of the harder settings while also managing to avoid projectiles, gather multipliers and avoiding dying. It is a mess, in an overall good way.  It's well conceived, but doesn't have enough middle ground in terms of difficulty for more casual players. It'll either put you to sleep or make you want to punch your monitor. Not much in between.Gameplay is your standard stuff. Avoid walls and holes while grabbing multipliers which increase the rate at which your score counts up per amount of time, along with powerups of various kinds which are level-dependant. nothing new or exciting, but still solid and fun for short spans of time.Controls are solid and seem to fit the level design as they should. At no point have I felt a death was unfair due to shoddy controls. It's tight and handles well, to an extent that all the dying you'll be doing (a lot), madding as it is, is not likely to feel overtly cheap.Aesthetic is kinda basic with no surprises. Strictly 'arcade' with a few different techno Tron-inspired layouts and color schemes, with a lightshow in the background which keeps a beat to the music.  Nothing spectacular, but I can't complain.Music is hit and miss. Each difficulty setting per layout has it's own track, with some having two tracks each which alternate. I found about 65% of the music to range from boring to annoying as hell, while the other 35% was decent and kinda catch and enjoyable. YMMV on this. Rather standard techo/electronica with scarce variety. Not in my opinion noteworthy.Overall I would fully recommend this game when it's on sale to people who already at least somewhat like the genre. They won't be disappointed in having another game for their collection to load up here and there for some casual fun. Nothing new here really, but nothing really bad either. You'll likely come away satisfied for at least a good 6-8 hours spread out over a few weeks."

,Recommended,286660,13795737,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,Novibear,It's a neat game simple controls you avoid stuff and cruise on. The music is okay however on endless mode it loops very well but things just keep getting faster. To be honest there is not much to the game with only 4 tracks with many preset difficulty stages to play and an endless survival mode I recommend it if you are looking for a time waster.

Not much to do after you've played every single level.-Can bore at times. Depends on the mood.-No variation in sound track, you get sick of the songs real fast-The AI voice can be tedious and yet sometimes annoying-The game loses it's feel after a certain amount of time./h1 My personal rating 6.5-7/10 Get it during a sale.As fun as it is it really just feels like an ios game that you could get for free. So I'd just spend a dollar on it and leave it at that."
