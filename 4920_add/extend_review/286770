Recommended if you played and enjoyed any of the following games:-Red Faction-Red Faction II-Half-Life ('98)-Killzone ('04)-Halo CE-GoldenEye (N64)-Early Clancy Games (Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon)-Gen. 6 Bond Games (Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, etc)-Gen. 6 Medal of Honor Games (Frontline, Rising Sun, Allied Assault, European Assault, etc)-Early Call of Duty Games (Finest Hour, Big Red One, United Offensive, etc)-Old DOS ShootersWill probably appeal to my generation (I'm 30) more than today's gamer, because this game embodies the type of shooters that we grew up with and includes none of today's modern conveniences/handicaps: There's no automatic health regeneration, no automatic ammo refill, and , as far as I can tell, no quicksaving. Instead, you'll have to pick up health packs, scavange dropped ammo from enemies, and complete missions to save your game and progress. Some of the missions can be somewhat challenging, and you never know if there'll be a mob of enemies, a tank, or an RPG around the next corner. The story is okay (so far), and it's complete with decent voice acting and fully animated cutscenes in between each misison.Kids, if you want to know the kind of game we frittered away hours with before Modern Warfare, then buy this game! Fellas, if you want a trip down memory lane, then you owe it to yourself to buy this game!"

Good gunplay, the ability to lean while aimed down the sights, good difficulty, cool story about nukes... it all plays like a really intense episode of 24.And the sound design: spectacular. Seriously, if you have a decent setup it will blow you away. Guns and explosions are deafening.The million dollar question though, does it hold up after ten years? I sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥think so! I played a little bit of it and was worried that I might be looking through rose-tinted glasses, but I was proven wrong. This game is solid all the way around.Downsides:-Graphics, but c'mon, cut some slack.-The FMV cutscenes are potato quality, like a Youtube video on a Comcast connection. Still does the job story-wise though.-No real widescreen support out of the box. Check out this page for a fix:http://www.wsgf.org/dr/shadow-ops-red-mercuryIn the end, for such a low price, you can't go wrong. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"
,Recommended,286770,17349095,"Posted: 2 August, 2015",all,lordsebastian101,"Overall a solid FPS game from 2004. Feels like an early COD modern warfare. It has some grand set pieces and stylistic cut scenes with not bad graphics for the time, feels like an action movie. The story is similar to battlefrield 3, you basically have to stop a rogue agent with a nuke (red Mercury). gameplay wise the guns feel heavy and combat is fast paced and fun. this game uses med packs instead of regenerating health. Also there are no checkpoints! each mission is broken down into a few levels, some are short, some aren't and if you die you restart the level. for the dirt cheap price it's worth a playthrough if you're a FPS fan."

While it only got a 6.1 from the professional (payed) reviewers, the user score of this game is a solid 8.0.Even after 10 years the gameplay in this game is pretty good. Obviously the mechanics are bit dated, but even today it is a whole lot of fun playing through the levels and more entertaining and challenging then the big budget CoD's from nowadays.Graphics (after tweaking in Nvidia control panel) can still look pretty decent (for a 2004 game).It's only to bad that it now has been released on Steam without any new changes (effort) to the game. They at least could have made it 16:9 compatible, unfortunately 1280x1024 is still the highest resolution you will get.75/100"

The game is about you, Captain Frank Hayden and your squad of Delta force elites to stop terrorists from getting their hands on WMD's. The graphics aren't the greatest but keep in mind this was for the Xbox one (old one not the new one) and we know what great games came from that console. The Campaing lets you battle the terrorist groups from the dusty streets of the Middle east, to the wet and compact jungles of the Congo. It reminds me of half life a little bit because every part of a level you beat makes you download another part of it. The weapons of the game are very unique because some of the weapons in the game you don't see in many modern shooters today. The beginning level of the campaing reminds me of the ending of COD4 a little bit. Multiplayer is amazing supporting up to 32 players. Overall this is a hidden gem of xbox games. I really hope that a company can make this again but add more campaing levels, update the graphics, and add some physics. 9/10"

,Not Recommended,286770,19361576,"Posted: 29 November, 2015",all,Ice #حرام,"To be honest i cant see why so many people recommend the game, though is supect heavy nostalgia goggles.tl;dr : A decent although in many regards outdated shooter with very poor leveldesignThe good things:Ammo is relatively limited, you get along but together with the limit of 3 bullet salves it discourages wild sustained spray fire.The Gunplay is fine, even though its outdated. i liked the way leaning was combined with Aiming, even though it felt rather clunky. overall the firefights are DecentThe Problems:The Teammates are basically useless, i've caugt my teammate waiting in front of a door while an enemy was shooting him without cover while standing mere 3 meters away. The teammate didnt even react.The obvious, the game is old, and the enemy bahaviour patterns are outdated, enemies just run to their waypoints and fire on you, i've played on ""Ranger"" and enemies tend to have lightning reflexes and Pixel perfect aim combined with X-Ray vision.in open firefights this is less of a problem but becomes very appearent in the ""house combat"" sections. This combined with unfair enemy placement  causes a lot of unpreventable damage.an example: you walk up stairs, a window 2 meters in front of you pops open and a guy starts firing at you, there is no cover or way to move to the side, so you have to take hits before you can kill him. Even though you start forseeing those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemy placements you still take hits due to aforementioned lightning reflexes and aim of the enemies.This poor leveldesign and enemy placement ultimately made me quit this game, since it seems to be designed in a way to be as frustrating as possibleConclusion:if you can get over the leveldesign and AI that seems to be dedicated to be as annoying and frustrating as posssible, you will probably find some enjoyment in this game"

The guns sound and feel very nice (unlike some games were they feel like weak little pea shooters). Story seems like a cheesy action movie, and i love it that way.

,Recommended,286770,23675804,"Posted: 20 June, 2016",all,Kyrii,"Well, ain't this a blast from the past?I remember renting this on the Xbox in 2004 after being bombarded by an avalanche of adds for the game on every gameplay video I watched on gamespot (everyone complains about the media player nowadays but the video player back in the day was like a brief glimpse of hell) and to be honest, the premise was quite enticing. Most FPS's back in the day fell into either the Sci-Fi or WW2 categories and most contemporary shooters were TPS's or tactical shooters like Rainbow Six, SOCOM, Counter-Strike, Delta Force or Ghost Recon. All of them were very realistic in terms of difficulty and pacing and were quite hard to get into because of that, so Shadow Op's was interesting as it took the more arcade-like approach to it's combat.I had a lot of fun with it back in the day so obviously I decided to pick it up many years later only to buy it again once more on Steam.So, obviously, considering I rented the game multiple times and bought it twice, my review is leaning on the biased side, but I digress. It's a nice blast to the past.No one ever saw an FPS like this, especially one that was trying super hard to play out like a big dumb summer thriller. While nowadays everyone is so sick of Contemporary shooters we are now gasping for joy at the prospekt of a WW2 shooter like the good ol' days, Shadow Op's is still quite astounding. The sound and production values were pretty crazy for an Xbox game in 2004. The audio itself was pretty damn impressive, with reverb in gunfire and outdoor environs giving your guns a more distant crackle with every pull of the trigger.Story wise, the plot is pretty forgettable but ironically, is saved by corny cliches that make otherwise crap dialogue unintentionally humorous in hindsight. This, coupled with the ridiculous ragdolls and giggle-inducing death squeals of fallen enemies gives the game an unintentional humorous edge. Which to me isn't a bad thing.Gameplay wise, the shooting mechanics are tight and the controls are responsive. The player is capable of leaning while using ironsights (an unseen concept back then) but I found crouching had to much of a delay in most firefights.Speaking of firefights, the game is chock-full of them. While boasting 25 levels you progress through them fairly quickly even on harder settings. On hard, enemies take more of a beating and can knock your health down if you are not as quick on the draw while on easier settings they go down like chumps and tend to spill ammo like blood. Regardless of the settings, I've noticed that their reflexes are still very high. However, there is no quicksaving or checkpoint saving whatsover. You have to get to the end of the level to continue, but if you die inches from the exit door, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ You have to do the entire level all over again! Offputting, but it's not as crushing as other games, due to the relatively short lengh of most levels and an overabundence of medkits.All in all, I had a lot of fun with this game back in the day and I still do now. It hasn't aged the best, Unreal 2 was showing its age in 2004 and while its used to good effect here, it's not exactly eyecandy, not to mention the Modern-Military edge may detter modern players due to an overstauration in the market, but I can't deny the fun I had playing this. It's big, it's loud, it's dumb and just like the conspiracy theory it is based off of, the story doesn't hold much water, but screw it. Shadow Op's is a nice relic that tried to be different in a market over-staurated with Sci-Fi and WW2 themes. So I guess I can tip my beercap in Shadow Ops' general direction.Give it a go :)"
,Recommended,286770,19532042,"Posted: 6 December, 2015",all,❤ Kaleidescoop,"It's a mish-mash of old and new, an action shooter akin to Modern Warfare far back enough as to have the ability to lean and to have more than 2 weapons but not regenerating health or a grenade indicator.  The game mechanics promote a more tactical approach, as opposed to run-and-gun.  While that's also fairly effective, the best way to proceed through a level without taking is to check around corners, use cover, and use the environment to your advantage.  As there is no checkpoint system and you are forced to restart the entire chapter if killed, this forces you to at least be somewhat mindful of your surroundings.Teammates are fairly competent at taking out enemies, although they do have issues with spotting them occasionally.  Enemy AI can be compared to the Call of Duty series: they spawn in, rush into cover, then periodically pop out and fire a few rounds in your general direction.  Thankfully, each individual enemy is hard enough that you'll only be up against a couple at a time, since a few well placed shots can potentially take a quarter of your health away in the blink of an eye.Guns are fairly responsive and the aiming system makes it easy to scope in around a corner without having to move your hands off of the movement keys and scout out an alleyway.  Unlike the earlier Call of Duty games however, you can also lean upwards above cover or downwards if there are gaps in terrain.  While you can still get shot at when leaning your head out, this gives you a much better chance of assessing the situation without exposing too much of your vital organs.All in all, a fairly decent shooter at its core if one can look past the outdated graphics and lack of proper widescreen support."
,Recommended,286770,19278526,"Posted: 25 November, 2015",all,Arcangel_zero7,"The Short and SweetShadow Ops: Red Mercury didn't make much of a splash when it came out for the original X-Box. I remembered enjoying the demo when it came on an Xbox Magazine Demo Disc long ago, and was quite surprised to see it on Steam. After all these years, it's still got a thing or two going for it. It's the Michael Bay-esque military shooter of the early 2000's you probably haven't played.It doesn't do anything particularly spectacularly, but it does MOST things well enough. If you're looking for a simple fast-paced run-and-gun to feel like a hero and kill a few hours, where your reflexes are tested more than your mind, you could do a whole lot worse. I'd definitely wait for a sale though, as you could do better for the current asking price of $7.00. Overall I had a great time until the later missions of the game, where enemy placement seems rushed and cheap.Detailed Review:I Liked it Because:Your standard sidearm is a massively oversized Desert Eagle...Yes, it's as awesome as it sounds. :)Before the Modern Warfare games standardized the entire genre, Shadow Ops borrowed heavily from games like Halo to make a cinematic console shooter.Heavy attention is paid to making the game feel like a film, and this is apparent right from the start of the first mission, which has your Blackhawk crashing into a desert town, surrounded by foes on all sides. The soundtrack, sounding like it was heavily influenced by Hans Zimmer, accents moments like these perfectly. It really lends a heroic feel to the whole experience when the main theme kicks in at climactic moments.Being an Xbox game originally, I didn't quite know how well it'd port to PC controls. Fortunately, they're just fine. Controls do what they should, there's no forced mouse acceleration, and your character has that lighter, more arcade-like feel, as opposed to the weighty, more massy dynamics of modern shooters.The shooting feels like it should, and the game keeps it simple by assigning your weapons at the start of each mission. Rather than picking up weapons from fallen foes, you simply resupply ammunition for whatever your given loadout happens to be. Some may be put-off by this, but I didn't mind it so much, as the game usually gives you at least one all-around gun that can do everything, in many cases, the standard M4.Speaking of simplicity, as expected, the game is 100% linear. Move from building, to corridor, to courtyard, blast all the enemies you just spawned, until you reach the end of each level. Standard formula. I didn't mind it.Also, being released before theevery-game-hero-is-Wolverinetrend, you actually have health and must pick up medkits to stay alive. Sometimes this works, sometimes it's a chore to backtrack, or annoying to waste an entire medkit by walking too close when you're at 80-something HP. But for those who are tired of panting dramatically to dislodge bullets from your body, you might find this refreshing.Before the innovations of cover-based shooters, this game contained leaning! And it's not half bad! Can be a little troublesome to get used to, but it works well enough to give you an advantage against your hitscanning foes.What Could Be Better:As mentioned above, the game came out for the original Xbox. Not the 360, but its enormous rectangular predecessor with the big green gem. That being said, even for its time, the textures can look ruddy and dated, and the video cutscenes are garbled and budget-looking.The story is standard fare for the time. Bad guy has a nuke, we're chasing the bad guy to stop him from nuking what he wants to nuke. There's betrayal, intrigue, some backstory for motivation, but it's nothing too special, and rather predictable.Grenades (in games) are supposed to be fun. They aren't in Red Mercury. While they still have their uses, they plop like rocks, so don't expect to be tricking them around corners.What Was Awful:Enemy AI. Not expecting anything revolutionary here for the budget, but placing stupid enemies in lame locations is 90% of the challenge here. The game will spawn enemies in the CHEAPEST possible places. It eventually gets predictable and infuriating, where no amount of skill will keep you from taking a few shots from cheaply placed enemies.Expect foes to pop around corners or from behind impenetrable doors, fingers on the trigger, hitscanning the crap out of you. The worst part is, it starts to feel like the game expects you to do the same. It actually becomes a valid strategy to hold down the trigger when rounding corners, in the hopes that you'll only get hit with one or two bullets instead of 20.Monster closets will also spawn enemies via triggers, to the point where it gets cheesy and predictable to get the game to just spawn dudes from behind a dumpster, who are, naturally, already firing at you with excellent accuracy. (Hopefully you're already shooting the empty air where they're GOING to be to stand a chance!)The long-range late-game missionatop the the Eiffel Toweris the pinnacle of this, where tactical ninjas will spawn from areas you already cleared, and snipe at you from ridiculous distances. Again, infuriating and obviously placed to wear the player down without much thought.If you can get it on sale, it's not a bad game. I got it for ~$2.00 if I can recall, and got more than that out of it. :)"

You play as Frank Hayden, a Delta Force Captain and all-round generic bad♥♥♥♥♥who has to stop the bad guys from detonating some super nuke which is 20x as powerful than a normal one or something like that.I'll start with the positive. Yes, there is only one. The guns sound pretty good. The assault rifles feel meaty. It's a shame that every other weapon in the game serves little to no purpose. Shotguns are patheticly weak and everyone drops like a fly. The M249 has way too much recoil and shakes the screen way too much. RPGs, Sniper Rifles and pistols may see limited use but you'll struggle to run out of ammo.For an Unreal 2 engine game this mofo is ugly. It's a console port and it's obivous. From the 'press the action key' promts to the limited controls to the lack of quick saves. Then again, I don't really care for graphics that much, but I felt it was worth mentioning.Some reviews on steam mention this game is hard. B U L L♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I N G S H I T. This game is easy, even on the hardest difficulty. The enemies have no intelligence at all. They'll run into their buddy's grenade, they'll form a line for you to shoot them. Add to the fact they die in 1-3 bullets and this game is a cake walk. Even with cheap enemy placement the enemy is pretty easy to defeat. The game play consists of two things. Shoot bad guys and plant SLAM charges to destroy something to pad out the game. It gets old, fast. Thankfully this game is mercifully short.Pickups are placed terribly. Most health kits are hidden in corners in a cheap attempt to amp up the difficulty. During the only boss fight you need to use an RPG and guess what? They hide the spare ammo a floor below you in a dark shadowed area. Gee, thanks guys...Story is boring. Nukes, Delta Team Six Black Ops stuff, Half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥love intrest, betrayals and terrible dialog. My favourite line went like this:Frank: Okay, I'm gonna save the world and shoot some more Russians/Arabs/Brown people/Aliens/Feminists/Nazis/♥♥♥♥♥♥ for freedom.Love interest: Be carefulCIA Agent: (as serious as possible) ""Just stick to the mission and then you can stick it where you want.""Then again, I got it for a $1 on sale, and for that amount, it's okay I guess.The mid 2000's produced some fantastic shooters, Half Life 2, SWAT 4, FEAR, Far Cry, XIII, Unreal Tournament 2004 etc. Shadow Ops: Mercury Rising does not hold a candle to this game."

An enemy is placed in pretty much every corner, and surviving pretty much requires knowing the enemy locations, this is proven by how easy the runthroughs become after playing that area once or twice. The AI are practically aimbotting, making combat mostly a contest of lean spamming. There is an extremely bad issue in the second mission where the map is covered in fog, but the AI can see a good few feet further than you. You are stuck charging down a bridge because if you stay back they can easily see you despite the fact that it would be impossible. In the same mission I had AI spawn at least once in places that it would be impossible to be. For instance, I cleared a wooden walkway, had 2 squadmates sitting there up top, but eventually had 3 AI randomly show up behind me. There was only one way down, and it was being watched by friendlies, but nope, I ended up having to restart the mission the first time because the enemy can teleport. The second time, of course, I quickly killed them knowing that they would show up.Speaking of friendly AI, I don't get the praise. Sure, they actually help, which is a step up from a lot of games. However, they are invincible other than scripted events and overall do a terrible job fighting the enemy 90% of the time. Also, one time I was advancing towards a friendly (in the first mission), only to move up further to find that an enemy (in clear sight of the friendly) was just sitting there with his back turned to him waiting for me to come around the wall further (despite the fact that he couldn't have realistically known I was coming).Also, though possibly more of a personal preference, you don't get close to enough ammo for the enemies you have to fight. Or, at least if you want limited ammo, make it slightly less of a twich shooter.Overall, if you want an old school game with frustrating AI aimbot play MoH: Allied Assault. At least it is overall pretty polished and has a plethera of cool concepts. In Shadow Ops' defence, maybe it gets better. But, I already have a headache from it and I don't feel like slogging through annoyingly designed missions to find out."

I was looking for the Sprint button when I loaded up the game and 3 different buttons including shift were ""Hit"" with the butt of your weapon.Reminds me of the campaign they tried to throw into Counter Strike Condition Zero. That was awful too. Like Counter strike there is no aim down Sights only scope and hip fire with a crosshair but this isn't a MP game like cs its a single player game.This released in 2004 and looks much worse than CS source features no multiplayer and the gameplay resembles Manhunter more than anything a game I enjoyed and finished but purchased for only 74 cents on sale and it was obviously a low budget indie title. I would reccomend Manhunter over this game for a short single player fps experience but Manhunter has more technical issues. I paid  less for it though than I did for this game and Manhunter at least has Sprint.The one good thing I can say about this game is that it started up and worked immediately without fiddling around and thats uncommon for old games."

Back then, it seemed like the most amazing thing ever. Any game that was gritty and realistic had to be amazing, right?No. Today, this game is absolutely laughable.Your teammates have some of the worst AI that I've ever seen. The most entertaining thing I saw in this game was watching Sgt. Gnucci charge up to an enemy, stop two feet away from him and start meleeing the air above the enemy's head all while being constantly shot. This lasted for about a minute until Gnucci retreated and let me kill the enemy.This isn't to say that the enemy AI is any better; they constantly shift between having superhuman perception and instantly killing you without you ever knowing where they are and being completely blind and letting you kill them without ever reacting to your presence at all.The environments are dull, the music is boring, but the voice acting is okay. That's the only positive thing I can say about this game: it has okay voice acting. That's not enough for an FPS to even be considered passable.One can look at this and say, ""It's an old game. It just hasn't aged well."" That's a valid argument, but I'd like to point out that this game came out the same year as Halo 2, and that game holds up pretty well. It's at the other end of the decade-old FPS spectrum.In summary, I'd rather hang out with Sgt. Johnson and kick some♥♥♥♥♥than watch Sgt. Gnucci get his♥♥♥♥♥kicked."

,Not Recommended,286770,12093557,"Posted: 13 September, 2014",all,kschang77,"Shadow Ops: Red Mercury is one of those shooters that's a lot of modern shooters traced their lineage from, but relied on mechanics that are just too old and unrealistic enemies to provide ""challenge"", resulting in a game that just doesn't accomodate casual players at all.The plot is pretty much cliche: a nuke had fallen into the hands of a terrorist, and you've been sent in to neutralize it. Except obviously, you got ambushed this way and that, enemies everywhere, and the enemy's about to get away... and... jump to couple weeks ago, when the whole mess got started.The missions basically mostly have you running around, alone, though occasionally you'll see your teammates shooting at the rest of the enemies, but mostly it's you, everything from taking out AAA to holding back a wave of enemies with a HMG to go through sniper alley, and so on and so forth. Those who play COD / COD MW will see a lot of similarities between this and their game.The game is a first-person shooter, though it has rudimentary cover shooting where you can lean around certain covers. How you do it through is a bit dodgy as it involves holding space while pressing left or right. There is no auto-heal. You are constantly on the lookout for first-aid kits and ammo. And enemies can pop up anywhere, even from behind you, as you are constantly looking for enemies around a blind corner and such. Fortunately, there is no ""door breach"" scenarios (i.e. Matrix-style shoot enemies in the head sequence)This game is old and the poly count of the models aren't that high, even at max everything settings. But the models aren't *that* bad. Sound is actually quite good, as are the music.The problem is there are just too many ""tired tropes"" in the game. There are so many betrayals, and the bad guy always get away... or does he? And then there's the question just how many bad guys are there that there's not enough good guys to deal with them (well, all except you). And enemies that pop up behind you, around corners, and so on? BORING! Add some cliche like ""bad Russians"", ""one-armed merc"", ""I leave no witnesses"", ""he's getting away!"", ""take out that tank"", etc. and it's getting a bit tiresome.All in all, if you want to play a good shooter, play a modern one."

It's very similar to an earlier Rainbow Six game because if you want to beat it you have to use strategy and cover. It's not a rambo game, and the killing is still satsifying. The sounds of all the weapons and voices are nastalgic for me because I used to play it on the original xbox when it was new. I wish Steam would release other xbox games like this. The one I pine to play most is Dead Man's Hand!--the best shooter ever!"
