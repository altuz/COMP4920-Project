,Not Recommended,286830,11212382,"Posted: 13 July, 2014",all,kschang77,"HTA Arcade is an attempt to dumb down the original Hard Truck Apocalypse (aka Ex Machina) into an arcade shoot-em-up. However, it does not support controller, and the keyboard/ mouse controls are horrible. The game is also extremely unbalanced, and there's NEVER enough heal. The in-game purchases to improve your trucks are EXTREMELY expensive, and lack of savepoints or checkpoints make the entire game extremely frustrating. You're much better off playing the actual HTA, not the arcade game."

Takes about 3 min but you'll get into the game.For the love of god, DO NOT TAB OUT OR IT WILL LOCK YOUR SYSTEM.Pro:Fun driving a APVEasy controls WASDCardsLow system specsCon:♥♥♥♥♥ to get runningVery datedGets boring fastOverall:5/10 +1 cards, +1 APV, -5 ♥♥♥♥♥ to get working = 2/10Would play if it was free and I wanted to shoot stuff with an armoured vehicle that can drown in water in 3 seconds. Fun for 5-10 min, then sucks. At this point it's less of a game and more of a frustration / steam card generator."

Missions are long, repetative and boring. Physics are stupid, graphics are aweful. Tornados in second mission made me delete the game because they make it almost unplayable. Avoid unless on a huge sale and you want cards."

,Not Recommended,286830,9539453,"Posted: 18 March, 2014",all,Nox,"This game is significantly unlike the other two HTA games on steam.  It is much narrower in scope and to me, much less interesting.  I like the other two games enough to tolerate the bugs and mayhem but this one is just not recommendable."

I really do not care for the way this game runs, and I would advice people to hold off until the bugs are worked out.BTW, I could never get HTA Ex Machina to load, and because I haven't played it for a minimum of five minutes, I cannot write a review of trhe game."

But it fails to launch with the error ""App already running"". Am trying to trouble shoot, but the Steam error corrections are not confidence inspiring. When I played the game before, it had troubles with XP as well and would not start. In its current form, I cannot recomment this game."

76561198030629896,Recommended,286830,33190956,Posted: 3 July,all,peteurpola,"Sure the game might crash if you try to change the resolution. Sure the game might crash if you try to alt tab it. Sure the game might crash if you change any of the graphical settings. Sure there might be invisible mines that lead to an instantenous and unavoidable death in level 6. Still I found this game to be quite fun and enjoyable. It has some flaws for sure, but nothing that can't be overlooked and it is cheap as dirt most of the time."
