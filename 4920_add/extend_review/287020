A relic from a bygone era deserving of its' cult statusThe games worst aspect is its combat, no question. The first 2 acts are traditional point and click style with the 3rd heavily incorporating combat additionally. While you CAN kill people in the first 2 acts there aren't many reasons to do so and there are consequences, many of them fail states. So when it came time to unleash I found it a welcome change of pace which added a nice, albeit frustrating at times, survival horror element towards the end. I managed to quite enjoy it despite its shortcomings but I understand why that isn't a popular sentiment. The timing of attacks is mostly luck but choosing the right weapon can make things a lot easier. Also there are opportunities to talk your way around some confrontations.If you are a horror fan (particularly if you have an eye for satire/ social commentary) and are craving an interesting story (even if, like myself, you aren't overly fond of the point and click genre) you owe it to yourself to pick this up at some point and persevere 'til the bitter end/s.If you're the type to take the Metacritic score into account I advise you to take note of the disparity between the critical and user reviews.There's also a GOG version if you'd prefer.. . . and if you'd like to see a review which mostly echoes my feelings toward Harvester then this LGR review is pretty close but it contains some SPOILERS, so fair warning.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtjAsQIPauY"

,Recommended,287020,32782154,Posted: 25 June,all,CorvusCorax,"FMVs, gore & violence, '90sAh, the good old '90s! Full Motion Videos were a new thing: the first time I saw them was when playing Command & Conquer. They gave you a movie-like experience (at the time these videos had an extremely low resolution, though). The way it affected the point-and-click adventure game genre was the inclusion of a lot of cutscenes in between stages and regardless of how serious the characters looked they were ultimately acting in a very cheesy way. It was as if you were taking part in a B movie.""You killed your family?""""What of it?""Harvester is on par with games such as Phantasmagoria 1-2 or Dark Seed 1-2. These were all games that tried to look like an interactive movie experience. And while Dark Seed introduced the unique vision of H.R. Giger into the gaming world Phantasmagoria and Harvester showed you something violent, something brutal that nobody had ever seen before. Your protagonist could die in many ways depending on the trap or enemy it faced. These cutscenes always depicted something horrible, something extremely gory.""You always were a kidder, Steve!""Our protagonist, Steve, wakes up one day only to find himself in the '50s. He does not recognise the town of Harvest; in fact, he has no idea who the people are in his house. As much as they claim to be his parents or younger brother he has no recollection of them. Amnesia or not, Steve has a big day ahead of him: he is soon to marry Stephanie and just as the future in-laws Steve's parents, too, expect him to join the Lodge. The Lodge is where the Order of the Harvest Moon is found and in order to join them Steve must complete the process of initiation. This consists of several tasks that are, unfortunately, violent things. These initially seem to be just pranks but will soon get out of control.""This town won't be the same without DNA's Diner. Or DNA, for that matter!""Once we leave an establishment the game shows us the map of Harvest. We are free to move anywhere we please. As certain activities are completed the game switches the day-night cycle. It's always worth returning to the same spot to speak with the same people. We can find out how they feel about the things happening in town and each day brings us closer to the Lodge and a truly horrifying, long sequence of gore-fest. During my playthrough the Lodge always reminded me of Twin Peaks' Black Lodge as some of the dialogues were similarly cryptic, nonsense mumbo-jumbo.""What're you doing, Steve?""""Playing Harvester.""Beside picking up items, using them, solving puzzles, interacting with people we also fight others ranging from people to the supernatural. A handful of melee weapons as well as guns are available for us to do so - these sequences can easily make us lose the game. Our health indicator should be checked manually by opening up our inventory. Remember: this was the '90s so no checkpoint system existed; a lost battle means game over once and for all. Make sure you save regularly especially in the last half an hour or so.""You've always been a kidder, Steve.""Although it received mixed reviews 20 years ago Harvester managed to become a cult classic. Frankly, I don't know if I should recommend this to kids from the new millennium. This is a must if you were born in the '80s and played many games in the '90s. You can give this one a try if you love point-and-click games and would like to get to know some of the gory ones from the '90s."

Beautiful and gory in all it's campy glory. Reminiscent of Phantasmagoria, in a more...Evil Dead kind of way.Featuring delightfully absurd dialogues that are sometimes unexpectedly insightful, a batshit crazy ending and buckets of black, morbid humor. If you have even the slightest taste for horror you should definitelly check this old gem.I love old games like this one. At the time the different genres of gaming weren't so clear-cut as they are today. Not having the imperative to be separated in perfect little boxes in order to identify a game as ""adventure"", ""action"" etc, resulted in games like Harvester. A game with heavy adventure elements, timed events, combats, different weapons you can actually aim and use, ammo to manage and of course, many deaths.There is a weird exhilarating sense of freedom in that lack of genre labeling in gameplay. You can't follow the patterns modern adventure games use, so even simple things may have an unexpected aspect to them. This kind of freedom in a game's design makes it more interesting -and of course, at times, harder to beat.*Unfortunately Harvester also carries with it the sexist tropes of the era, so if you can't stomach good old sexism, a touch of homophobia, gratuitous sex scenes, ladies in lingerie and violence against women then you should probably choose another game. I was able to enjoy it despite of this, but I can't say that this will be the case for everyone.*But, thankfully,  in case you get stuck, it has one of the most beloved ""features"" of old games: cheat codes.

(I might SPOIL some parts of the game or more so don't read if you hate spoilers)The best way I can describe Harvester in my opinion is the perfect serial killer simulator because of the bizarre atmosphere of the town of Harvest, the unsettling NPCs of this small town like Mr. Pottsham (obsessed with meat) who is a molester & a pervert who likes watching Stephanie 24/7 (I don't blame him Stephanie has nice cur...... errr let's continue) or Steve's ""mother"" who is an extreme BDSM enthusiast (That ♥♥♥♥♥ has all sorts of other issues which I won't mention) & don't forget the stages of a serial killer which you can read herehttp://www.criminalmindsfanwiki.com/page/Psychological+Phasesif you wish.Puzzle wise the game wants you to think illogical & dangerous the entire game so you have all the time in the world to do stupid crap before you get the electric chair by the corrupt police who are extremely delusional, lazy & idiotic towards real crimes like arson or attempted murder, the combat is the biggest flaw the game has because it is cringeworthy & broken the entire game so it is based on luck but I forgive this flaw because Harvester gave amazing writing from Gilbert P.

Not because of the gameplay, but the subject matter. This is an adventure game for the first 2/3rd's of it. The game uses FMV videos so you will see very campy acting from human characters, however I think this fits perfectly with the games unsettling tone. The sound is fine, nothing stands out, but nothing bad does either, it's perfectly fine.The gameplay starts as a point and click game and a good one. You click to navigate and to pick up and use objects. It has nice puzzles and although it can be hard to know where to go next, the town is small enough that it won't be for long. The last 1/3rd of the game is the stumbling block though, as it focuses on action. It's really bad. It felt too random, like I wasn't in control of the outcome. To be fair some of the best puzzles are in the last parts of the game, I just wish it wasn't bogged down by awful combat.The story is the real star here. It was so interesting that I kept going even in the worst parts of the game. Everyone was weird in their own way and I really wanted to know why, as the town gives a weird vibe from the moment you step out of your room. And without spoiling anything the game dives into subject matter that can get...uncomfortable. While the game isn't the goriest ever, it was still hard to get through some of it. But it wasn't for tacky shock value. It's trying to make a point. And that point is probably more relevent now than it was when the game first came out.Overall this game is worth playing for the story. Just know that this game will test your will power because of the content and your patience because of the last 1/3rd of the gameplay8/10"

Now let me start off by saying Harvester is NOT for everyone. Do I  myself love this game? Yes I do but for those easily offended or for those faint of heart I suggest staying away although I highly recommend the game it's audience is not aimed at those people but if you are still curious I would say it's worth looking into for sure just be prepared for what you are getting yourself into.You start off the game with some 90's FMV sequences and the introduction of your main character Steve. Oh what a kidder Steve is along his journey he will uncover who he is and what is the deal with this Stepford Suburbian's town of Harvest. There will be many a zany characters in this such as the soon to be stepdad who loves meat human or otherwise , the gay firemen.....dare I say they are flaming!? , The Wasp Woman and even your own mom be careful on asking her to have sex she just might take you up on that offer......uh.. yeah okay. Anyways the mechanic's are your typical point and click fashion except no real way to get permanently stuck thank goodness but I would recommend saving often. You never know when that Officer who has no legs with PTSD will gun you down and set off the rockets killing you all.You will soon be introudced to all these characters and the more important ones such as Stephanie your soon to be wife who is in the same situation as you are with no recollection of what happened before or what is going on now and the Sergeant at Arms who is associated with this ""lodge"" everyone in town is obsessed with. What is the meaning behind it? Well it's your job to find out the Sergeant will task you with multiple things to do to pass the days and uncover the lodge's mysteries. There are multiple endings and some ""dead end"" endings too so watch out. Overall it's a really fun game with tons of satire , metaphors , violent for the sake of being violent , goofyness cheezy for the sake of being cheezy (and for the plot) so if all of that sounds good and catching STDs from hookers then this game is for you!"

While my friend and I thought it was the bloodiest, most disgusting game ever made, I can look back on it now and laugh; the cartoon-y gore is clearly supposed to be over-the-top and played for laughs (see: the ""spinal cord"" scene on YouTube). Very much in the same vein as Sierra'sPhantasmagoria, but with much lower production values.Harvesteris split into two parts: Discs 1 and 2 are the ""adventure"" segments which involve running around town and collecting clues, not unlike the first Phantasmagoria (which had much better acting, IMHO). The last disc spins the title off into somewhat of an action sequence in which you climb, floor-by-floor, the mysteriousLodgebuilding full of total whackos (whom you are given the choice of helping or killing with a variety of tools, including a nail gun, katana or shotgun).This is just a straight-up emulated port of the MS-DOS version, complete with all the glitches and crashes I experienced fifteen years ago. Do yourself a favor and use the ""enchanced"" DosBOX program [the second option] from the launcher when playing: it speeds up the loading times during the FMV sequences.Pros:Killer music (at least the rock tracks in the Lodge), funny dialogue, interesting ending.Cons:Choppy animation, faulty game engine, horrible combat design -- it's a buggy game."

It's a game that suffered a lot from being in a transitional period for computer hardware and software, and the manufactured controversy angle it went for completely fell flat on its face as Harvester missed its initial release date by two years.Harvester does a lot of things other games get credit for but all the way back in 1996 (technically as early as '94 if you cut the developer some slack). While it's under developed puzzles and ludicrous content (the gay firehouse and ability to kill children strike me as two elements definitely unlikely to fly in modern times) make it hard to recommend for gameplay purposes, and the end 'boss rush'-sequence borders on unfair, this game does three things well: metafictional commentary, ludonarrative harmonium, and actually interesting content (the aforementioned boss rush has one fmv sequence that is genuinely disturbing and I really dug that).This game taunts players and crafts a self aware and self reflexive narrative that is enjoyable for its timeliness. This preceeds many great games that experiment with the meta, such as Metal Gear Solid and Undertale for two easy examples. It's also a lovely time capsule in how to approach these elements and how public thinking on video games was truly absurd at one point.It is also a game that possess very poor gameplay. It wasn't good when it came out and it isn't interesting in retrospect. That said, many of the gameplay choices are fascinating ""in concept"", but more importantly, and especially with the game's central twist in mind, many of the design choices make sense within the context of the game world. This doesn't make it fun to play as the combat is bad and the puzzles are lazy, but in more capable hands some of it's more noble failures could have been executed interestingly.Lastly, this is a game that is full of schlock and absolute trashiness. My brother and I actually played through this whole ordeal together, and for large parts it fails to be horrifying and it fails to be shocking. Even at time of release, much of its most disturbing content was at best in poor taste and at worst completely uninteresting. That said, this gives is a b-movie kind of charm. Scratch that. It gives it a z-movie kind of charm. The terrible fmvs are enjoyable kitschy, but on the rare occasion this games content actually works in its intended fashion (off the top of my head, the peeping tom next door dad is a sequence that is gross but deservedly so, and the trials of the lodge have a few moments of actually dark content) by George it actually works. And you almost want to root for the game for that.Basically, if you have a Sunday to kill, maybe a few beers, this is a game worth playing for that kind of ""are you kidding me, this is so stupid"" kind of entertainment. I'm solidly recommending it because let's plays exist and the game also goes on sale frequently. Plus, you can expedite many of its worst elements via cheat codes."
,Recommended,287020,13010136,"Posted: 19 November, 2014",all,wwwdotshutthehellupdotcom,"Harvester is a great game, but it's not for everybody.It claims to be the ""most violent adventure game of all time,"" but ""most disturbing"" or ""most offensive"" might be more appropriate.  As well as exceedingly violent, the game is also homophobic, misogynistic, and generally rife with unpleasantries; be aware that the game is designed as satirical self-parody, intended for consenting adults only.Concerning gameplay: what begins as an interactive B-movie eventually evolves into something quite different, along the way featuring plenty of tongue-in-cheek commentary on violence and death (within the video game medium and without).  Mature adults will laugh at the game's goofiness and gore, but will also understand the point being made using all the blood and insanity.Save often, use multiple save files, and expect lots of reloading."
,Recommended,287020,24992771,"Posted: 18 August, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Ah, Harvester, it's a classic full motion video (FMV) point-and-click game that has been both praised and scorned over the years. When it originally came out in 1996, many critics said that the game felt dated due to its delayed release, but these days gamers can't seem to get enough of this gore-soaked B-Grade title; save for the prudes who don't enjoy cheesy horror like Evil Dead, Basket Case, or even Silent Night, Deadly Night.During the game, you play as an 18 year old guy named Steve Mason; trust me, you were always such a kidder, Steve. It turns out that he has severe amnesia, to the point that he doesn't even remember that he's engaged and set to be wed to a woman named Stephanie in three weeks time. No one in the town of Harvest believes that he has amnesia, which frustrates him to no end. During the time that you will spend in the small town of Harvest, population 51, you will meed a variety of wildly eccentric and somewhat wacky characters, all who have their own personality quirks; a deputy who is obsessed with jerking off to nudie mags, Stephanie's father who is off his rocker about meat, a crazy school teacher who thinks that the best way to discipline her students is by beating them with a baseball bat, gay firemen... the list just goes on and on.Well, it turns out that Stephanie has just as severe of a case of amnesia that Steve does. The goal of the game comes down to getting in to this mysterious, secret organization known as The Order of the Harvest Moon, whose headquarters are located at the Lodge. Steve needs to join them prior to the Harvest Annual Blood Drive Donation at the end of the week, which is mandatory... and perhaps deadly. The gameplay is separated in to days, and as such you will play through a total of six days (some with night events) and three levels of the Lodge. The entire game, if you're using a guide, will take around 7-8 hours to complete; if you're not using a guide, it could take you upwards to 20 hours to figure out the complex puzzles and how to initiate the game moving from one day to the next.Harvest is a fairly large town for having such a small population, it has 18 locations to explore; although some of them you will only end up visiting once or twice. There are just as many characters to interact and converse with, as well as to potentially murder. That's right, Harvester also features a fighting mechanic; left clicking lets you examine, pick up, and use objects, while right clicking lets you attack. You will find a large amount of weapons to use during the course of your playthrough, all which can be individually equipped via the inventory screen. Not only are you able to kill people, but once you reach the later Lodge levels, there are monsters that you will have to take out as well.Surprisingly, this title has aged incredibly well in both looks and functionality. The abundant FMVs are riddled with gore, cheesy dialogue, and bad acting; even though they're low quality and slightly pixelated, they're still incredibly enjoyable to watch time and time again. It's even worth it to go out of your way to explore all of the different ways that Steve can die, and to interact with all of the characters as many times as possible to view all of the cutscenes. Talking with people in the town of Harvest will show ""key words"" that you can select that act as topics for discussion, though some disappear after speaking about another subject you can type in any keywords that were available; this is one retro game where keeping a pen and paper handy is actually still useful.I could go on singing praises about Harvester all day, but sadly the Steam version has a few kinks that will most likely never be worked out. For some people, the game crashes often; this did not happen to me. For a lot of people, the FMV cutscenes, which are arguably the best part of the game, will refuse to play; this actually did happen to me, and you do miss out not on just a lot of the fun stuff, but a lot of the story as well. There's only one known fix for the latter issue, and that's to lower the frame cycles in DOSBox to 8000. Doing so makes the gameplay infuriatingly choppy and sluggish, fortunately most of the FMVs are located on the sixth day, and only sporadically throughout the rest of the game.Even with the problems that weigh this port down, Harvester is an amazingly fun, low-budget horror title that's seething with blood, gore, intestines, crude phallic jokes, bad acting, cheesy dialogue, and hilarious FMV cutscenes. Some of the more memorable moments for me were when the deputy was caught jerking off, and finding the children eating their mother; not to mention the countless sessions of dialogue that will stick with you, such as the meat obsessed father of the bride. If you're a fan of old B-Grade movies like the ones I listed in the introductory paragraph, or if you played and enjoyed games such as Sanitarium, Phantasmagoria, and I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, then you will absolutely dig Harvester. However, for a dollar more you can purchase it on GOG and avoid any potential issues that the Steam version has.Rating:5.0/5.0- An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

Whether it be Postal, Harvester, Dark Seed 1 and 2, Sanitarium, IHNMAIMS and so on.  The whole game reeks of this seemingly innocent 50's atmosphere, but beneath the surface, theres much more than meets the eye. Basically coming off as an overly edgy Twin Peaks, chock full of gore, some much needed 90's angst, and hilariously outdated social commentary, which is seemingly a total recipe for disaster, ends up being the most enjoyable and entertaining point & click I've ever played. From the get-go, literally the first conversation you get engaged in, just immediately shoves some not-so-subtle social commentary right in your face and forces you to choke it down. You converse with your supposed ""family"", complaining of amnesia, but Steve being the kidder he is, is ignored and pointed in the direction of the lodge. On your way, you meet a quirky and demented cast of characters that (barely) help you along the way. Excuse me for my lack of information, but it's one of those game that you absolutely have to experience for yourself. Reading a synopsis or watching a walkthrough doesn't serve it justice in the slightest. It's a psychotic, disturbing and hilarious mess that everyone must experience."

You wonder around Harvester, trying to remember what's what as you suffer from amnesia all of a sudden. Harvester is from the odd age of PC games, or at least right at the end of it. The game is a point 'n' click, complete with odd plots, pixel hunting, and sometimes hilariously woeful animations, visualisations and 'great' voice acting. The game tries to mix things up near the end, with very mixed results, with some sections coming off as boring or weak compared to the rest of the game.The quirk, is that nothing is ordinary. People are obsessed with anything, be it corpses, meat, wasps, or whatever else. FMV cutscenes tell the story hilariously. As mentioned before, the voice acting and ridiculous writing that would ruin any other game gives Harvester an excellent personality. Be it staring at Spinal Cords and thinking about pie, or be it becoming somewhat genuinely disturbing, Harvester's plot is memorable because of its plot is its greatest quirk.Visually, it’s an FMV game, and you can tell by looking at it that it's an FMV. The characters feature quite a bit of animation considering this. Unfortunately, dialogue is not animated, but it is fully voiced by Harvester's all-star cast, which although all sound really odd, perfectly portray the screwed up world that Steve inhabits. The environments are extremely weird, and the cutscenes featuring full-motion video are extremely strange.The soundtrack is very varied, featuring a variety of different music. Although it sometimes seems unsuitable, once again because of the weirdness this game strives in, I can't tell if this is intentional, or if it’s just really shoddy design.Overall, there isn't much you can say about Harvester. Harvester is just a bloody weird game, and because Harvester is so weird, I have to recommend this to as many people as possible. The game is just weird, and deserves some attention now, being a breath of fresh air in the modern day of serious, competitive gaming. Although the game gets weaker near the end, there is plenty of meat here to keep you entertained, despite its stupidity."

I don't care too much about obsolete graphic, clunky controls, but I care about gameplay in general.This game can be completed without walkthroughs/hints only if you have at least some skill in telepathy, because gameplay here consists only of searching items that you will need in future.

So, what options do we have: 1) We have the man, that commited arsons in the past. Maybe we need to speak to him. No! 2) Maybe we need to lure the Diner owner outside first. No! 3) OK, maybe we try to talk to the man that feels lust for the Diner owner. No! ... khm, what must we do then? We must go to the church and randomly click on the coffin, suddenly there we see a deceased man. But we have been here before and coffin was empty. OK. We must take a photograph of the deceased and exchange it for glue. End of Day 5.And the whole game consists of similar ""puzzles"" - click every screen over and over again until you'll suddenly find something new. I know that developers intentionally made this game nonsensical. But nonsense in plot has nothing to do with the nonsense in gameplay.Let's conclude: this is absurdly illogical game and if you want to look at walkthrough every now and then, than you might try this game. Otherwise - strictly not recommended."

Shock the viewer with hilariously bad graphic violence and dialog. The game is charming, it locks you in as soon as you first step out of your room and greet your brother. All of the characters are uniquely bizarre and do a surprising good job at conveying what the game is trying to do. Even if the graphics and video are granulated, I still see a wide variety of gamers this should appeal to. As I do not want to give too much away, I'll end it with this. It's one of those games with multiple endings, depending on how you play, the game could end within the first five minutes of game-play. It's a title that shrouds the illusion of choice, what you do actually impacts how events take place. I'm sad to say I didn't play this title when it was first released. Although I played this game a many years ago when I was still in my early twenties, I feel as though it was the right time, because a eleven year old me back in 1996 just couldn't appreciate a game like this. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of FMV games, or just a fan of cheesy B Horror movies.  Two thumbs up."

The acting/ voice acting is pretty good for it's time. I see alot of reviews complaining about the acting but honestly... It's from 1996 and I think it's impressive for a game of that year.This version plays in a DOSBox, and for some reason steam overlay won't work with it. So not really a differents in getting the GOG version besides the trading cards and the steam game time counter.Overal the  game has no bugs besides the ocation where the FLV cutscenes freeze for a while before they start or they just skip (if the cutscene is like one second, so nothing valuable lost.)Another slight problem is that somethimes the game could freeze, this happens often while being in dialogue with people after their last sentences. A right mouse click will unfreeze it.The game is also forced 4:3.The gameplay is fluent, altough the game is very hard to figure by yourself out. There are moments when you HAVE to look up a guide. Just because you can get easily stuck. Also if you want to buy the game and want to play for the first time a blindly walktrough then I recommend you to save the game often. If you pick a wrong choice in the storyline then you could be f*cked for the rest of your game, or the storyline might just be stuck forever."

Of course this game is outdated, which explains a bit of this crudeness, but I also noticed from many factors that the Harvester is flawed and unfinished - for example there are entire enviroments and NPCs that have nothing to do with the story and gathered weapons before entering to the lodge have barely any use at all.I don't deny that I would have loved the juicy storyline of Harvester, but in any other aspect it was crude and blunt - it just wasn't fun to play and technically the worst point'click game I've ever played and the 1-button fighting control system didn't appear to the games advandage either. Yeah - the fighting system in point'click game. The feature may sound like a bonus, but when the system is as fun as rubbing backside with a sand paper I really avoided fighting.

It is just a bunch of as much randomness and insanity as possible without any central theme whatsoever. Everything that happens is just a bad excuse of a real story.If it is meant seriously on the other hand, it is just badly realised crap. An ugly looking crap with bad controls and a stupid story telling (If you want to call it like that). The whole stupid violence and crackbrained efforts to create disgust are simply plain dull. It may be controversial, it apparently was when it has been published, but I can’t see anything that really provokes me. It is a childish Fantasising about violence without anything special about it. Any symbolism, metaphorical reference or any other medium of meaning is just soulless and meaningless. And I can’t ignore that, because there is nothing else to focus: No remarkable gameplay, no special look or art style, no fun in playing this imbalanced mess.And that disappoints me very much. From Minute one I saw and I waited, fascinated from the dark (humorous) world full of quirkiness to actually deliver something. But anything that could have created some meaning in this pile of randomness came to nothing. All this references to: Atomic Weapons, religious extremism, bigotry, child abuse and murder, homophobia, the somehow creepy societies in small towns, peversion ... – all this is right there, ready to create meaning or at least a story.

So you can expect an epicly gorey and surreal adventure. You'll want to try and explore every area of the game and you'll be surprised or shocked by some of the stuff you'll see.If you remember the classic point and click adventure games, then you'd already know the fundamentals of playing this game. Click on things, Pick up items, Heavy dialog from various NPCs, Work out cryptic puzzles, Think about using an FAQ. All those natrual moments of point and click adventures will come to you. So if that thrills you, This is a title to pick up. If you need an extra push on the decision... here's the story.The beauty of this game is basically waking up not knowing a single thing. You dont know where you are, who you are, or what you are meant to do. and after briefly talking to various people in the town, You find out you have amnesia. As you discover parts about yourself, you also learn the town you are in is not exactly like other towns. You have your average buildings like Schools, Police station, General store but the largest building in the centre of the town is The Lodge. No one in town knows whats inside but you'll need to gain access to it. If you manage to succeed, You might be lucky to actually understand what the whole story of this game is.As for the violence and gore? Well there's definately a lot of that. There was several settings and scenarios that may upset some people and if I could admit, there was one particular scene I came across which even I was shocked by. The FMV movies have some porno-intro style acting but it gives the game a unique touch.It might feel dated now, but the story and the enviroment you are traveling through. It feels like a surreal bad dream and for some reason, when things are so creepy or unusual we cant help but be curious to get more. So I'd say if you can get this game, Grab it."

So conceptually this game is great. Unfortunately, beyond the writing and directing the game starts to fall apart with lots of bugs and possibly the worst combat system ever devised. Every weapon has a different range and firing speed, but it always winds up being a speed-click contest regardless; you can also aim upward, middle, or downward but this seems to be pointless. It's a shame, because this game was delayed two years for the programming alone, which seems to have done more harm to the project than good.In short, this game didn't get the budget it deserved. The good news is, it's only the second half where the bugs become apparent and only in certain places. The game is still awesome and replayable.

He grabs the magazine, rolls it up and starts hitting him with it.15/10---------------------------------------------------------Anyway, this is an extremely strange retro horror/adventure game with a KILLER( ba dum tsss) sense of humour. You walk around different areas looking like a character from Mortal Kombat and you can access the map at any time to travel to different parts of a small, weird town.This is one of those old games where figuring out what you are supposed to do is next to impossible and a walkthrough(at least, for me anyway) is almost mandatory to beat the game.You play as a young man of nonspecific age who wakes up not knowing what the hell is going on. All around town the people are really creepy and weird. There's a military guy who has no legs or groin who guards a nuclear missle base sitting in town, there's a house with some old wasp lady(who doesn't factor into the game's story at all. you don't even have to go to her house to complete the game), there's a butcher shop with blood everywhere and dead cats all over the place and there's a giant druid-looking building called ""The Lodge"".You find out that you're supposed to try and become a member of The Lodge by the end of the week and to do so you have to complete tasks for the really cool guy who runs it. A guy, who talks with his mind in an awesome voice.I don't think I would have been able to figure out what to do honestly but basically in completing the tasks you will talk to all kinds of people and the story is littered with creativity and incredibly dark campy humor. In this story you will see many cutscenes with the bad actors being hilarious in front of crappily animated early-3D backgrounds and it's a wonderful sight to behold. It seems as if the developers thought of everything as there are so many secrets to be found through dialogues and doing things in certain orders that triggers funny responses and, in some cases, exclusive death cutscenes. Any time you die it will trigger a cutscene of the main hero being brutally murdered in whatever manner you managed to die in the game.I think that if you like the early Peter Jackson films like Bad Taste or Dead Alive(known as Brain Dead in some countries) then you should really consider giving Harvester a play and maybe even look at walkthrough to see what this game has to offer. Once you complete all of the tasks and get into the lodge finally you have to complete the ""trials"" of becoming a lodgemember and it's really cool to see what lies inside. It's a huge building with so much personality and creativity around every corner and once you get through it you have access to an awesome twist that explains what is going on and a choice between two solid endings.-------------------------------------------------After hearing things about this game I always thought that it would be worth a look and boy, was I right. Now this game probably isn't for anyone, as people seem more sensitive these days(no offense) but the non-pc humor happened to be right up my alley.I do feel bad for the original makers of Harvester as, after they had completed the game it took them a year or two to finish the programming and by that time the it was already outdated as technology was rapidly improving around the time this game came to fruition and the game didn't sell very well.Nightdive Studios made the game accessible without using DOS and polished up a bit for easy use and I really love them for redoing a bunch of retro games and selling them on Steam. They did System Shock 1 and 2, Turok, Shadow Man and on top of that they're doing their own modern sequel or remake of System Shock!While I do wish the original creators of Harvester could be getting more money for their game on Steam(I am almost positive they are not but correct me if I am wrong) I am definetely happy to give my money to the great Nightdive Studios."

It certainly features extremely flawed gameplay but it's strength is in exploration, as you never know what kind of demented pit is next, and the bizarre dialogue and characters, which alone make it worthy of a play.The only real problem (outside of the terrible combat system) is a problem with dosbox, where u'll skip cutscenes... there's a fairly easy fix given some file scouring experience. It can be found by Goggles™ or I think it's posted on the forum page here on steam, but basically involves changing a number in the dosbox to reduce the sensitivity of mouse presses; I think this oversensitivity causes the game to think u clicked twice so it skips the cutscene with 1 very fast click. This is almost mandatory to fix as those cheesy, poorly shot things are just great."

The puzzles or just progressing can be either difficult or tedious and you may have too look up a guide just to progress. If you are a 90's kid then the game will be a bit of a nostalgia trip for you considering the game was made in 96.

,Recommended,287020,26461314,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Spaghetti★,"I am deciding to rewrite this review to a full scale review. There will be spoilers ahead so be warnedNow Harvester is an old Dos game from the ""weird"" era of PC gaming where the games weren't limiting themselves from offensive content to reach a mass audience like they are today. Games like Fallout and Phantasmagoria really worked to bring a creepy realism to the game. Harvester clearly does the same and quite well to be honest. The atmosphere is quite creepy and character interaction feels real yet slightly off (as intended,) and the town, which is named Harvest, feels like it's something out of a parody. The game itself goes from weird and zany to downright creepy.Let's get on to the story and there are heavy spoilers within, the story itself is quite well written in the beginning, and the end but the middle feels slow in my opinion. It starts with your character, Steve,  being an amnesiac, people don't believe it because ""You always were a kidder."" You find out you are engaged to a woman named Stephanie. Talking to the townsfolk, you find information about this so called ""Order of the Harvest Moon"" which most people just call the Lodge. They implore you to join as if your life depends on it. You have to join for the story to progress of course, and in order to get into the lodge you must pass these daily tests, starting at harmless pranks like scratching a car to burning down a woman's diner, quite the escalation. You can check on your bride-to-be and tell her what's going on, yet eventually she is murdered with only her spinal cord left behind along with a lodge invitation, You gain entry to the lodge, after giving the Sergant of Arms Stephanie's spinal cord, and the surreal elements of the game start to pick up again. You go through trials, killing monsters, learning about life and death along the way.This game is quite creepy, and is actually quite fun but there are some problems with it. As i mentioned the story loses itself somewhere in the middle, a lot of the well written dialogue and character development can be completely avoided, even parts of the game can be avoided and sometimes I feel like they didn't even really program them into the game. This is a point-and-click, and wonky at that. It could be this version of the game, I've head the GOG version is much better. I would recommend this game if you're looking for something to really give you the willies, but I wouldn't reccomend this game if you don't have patience for outdated gaming styles or outdated story telling."
