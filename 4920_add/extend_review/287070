Dismouted Scouts, wheeled & tracked Recce Vehs / APCs (Sdkfz 234/1 armored car, Sdkfz 251/16 half-track and more) are used  to peel back the fog of war, and find the soft targets that cannot otherwise be seen until they fire upon you.   Light, Medium and Heavy Armour options exist, (M5s, Shermans, Fireflys, PNzr II. III, Panthers, Tigers, Jagdpanthers, Marder, Hummel, British Matilda 1&2, French FT-17 Lt Tk, R35 Med Tk, Char Bis & Somua 35 Heavy Tk, Italian  Autoblinda 41 armoured car, Carro Armato L640, Fiat 3000 and more) to soften up Infantry or take out opposition vehicles.  Then infantry of several types (Scouts / Engineers / Waffen SS / Paratroops / FJ / Commandos / Rangers / Flamethrowers etc) may attack against a wide variety of AT / MG guns and other Inf.  - There are many, many more unit types - however - the widest variety of units may only be accessed by buying several of the DLCs.Some scenarios have onboard indirect fire i.e. Mortars and Assault Guns, some scenarios have offboard Artillary / Naval Guns / or Airstrikes (Stukas, Hurricanes, P47s), there is as well some AA & SPAA.  Most every scenario and campaign in the main game and DLC is played from the Allied side where one can pfight as US/ UK/ and Canadian units - there are as well a few Axis scenarios and a short campaign where one can fight as the Germans against mostly the French and UK.The commercial scenarios are pretty fun and plentiful -  however the DLC price hit for each new campaign is a bit of a downer.  I liked the scenarios / campaigns but there is way too much nickle and diming for my tastes, (the mod scene is however very active with a large # of homebrew single and multi-player scenarios).A fairly gentle learning curve starts things off easy for noobs and although it may be too easy for vets, it soon ramps up so that one has to use realistic tactics to crack differant tactical problems.  Commanders will soon be wondering where to spend or save their scenario options like medic points (reviving injured soliders), leader points (to rally squads with low / broken morale); as well most campaigns let you earn and spend scenario points to buy new units or upgrade your combat team's resources.Gamers raised on fully-3D games may not like the graphics, but for what it is and what it should be compared to I liked it's simple and effective style; the terrain and units were easy to discern and therefore orient yourself on the ground and to the enemy. I do however wish the camera controls were a little better.In the end not quite as detailed tactically as the newer Close Combat games, nor quite as addictive as the old PGen series, but still a good game with plentiful scenarios.  As is the game will keep most grognards entertained and still fun for new players.- Fun:  8/10- Historical Interest: 7.5/10- Ease of learning, continual challenge: 7.5/10- Replay Value: 6/10 (if you don't mind using the editor to make mods then 8/10)- Presentation / GUI: 7.5/10 (I like the comic book intros & transitions...)- Value for your $: 7.5/10 (good game but don't nickle us with each DLC being so short.)== Overall: 80%"

While in actual gaming you find out that BA consists of almost every elements you need in a tactical game.It's good for both new gamers and experienced gamers."

The strategies are important if you wish to do well and keep your units alive, yet, not too large of a learning curve. Graphics are somewhat  ""comic book"" in nature, not in a derogatory way at all, quite like them.Perfect for getting into a scenario quickly, finishing or playing as long as you like, saving, and coming back later.If you are looking for very in depth logistics or cutting edge graphics, this isn't the product for you. For relatively low learning curve, fun graphical content, great sound effects, many types of units and terrain, you can't beat the BA franchise.Would love to see Slitherine produce a campaign version of this product. Perhaps with enough interest we could convince them."

Bought it at xmas for £7 and its gotta be the bargain of the year. if you enjoy ww2 stratergy arcade type games you will want this. Theres plenty of missions plus more from users you can download via the game. If they were only this good in the early noughties life would of been good. Have not come across any issues graphics or sound wise, Playability wise theres three levels, installs and runs great straight out the box. you can zoom in and outta the map for better effects or for those commanders who like to see all.Great fun 4 everyone !"

Don't expect sprawling maps or dazzling graphics, this is a minimalist game, but it's great for a few minutes of fun at the end of a long day when you have neither the time or the brain cells for an evening-long gaming slog. I got mine on sale and think I got a good gaming value for the money. If you're intruiged by WWII armor combat and your gaming time is limited, I would recommend it."

It is one of those games that finally allowed me an access point to all those RTS titles I have in my Steam library. At last a game that teaches you strategy while steadily amping up the difficulty level. The graphics are surprisingly detailed yet fun at the same time. There is a huge variety of missions especially if you get the complete pack. There is enough complexity to also keep more experienced wargamers interested. I was really surprised at how good this game is. My only negative would be the rather steep price especially for the complete game, given the fact that for all intents and purposes it is a souped up Ipad port. However it is done really well and if you are willing to shell out you won't be disappointed and are in for hours of replayable fun!"
76561197962946527,Recommended,287070,25882680,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,SDC Robert Locksley,"This is a simple but challenging World War Two turn-based strategy game that's surprisingly better than Panzer Corps because the enemy doesn't receive unlimited reinforcements, doesn't have twice the numbers you start with, and the probabilities aren't stacked massively against you after the tutorial. There are so many campaigns to choose from, and for British grownups there's a happy reminder of ""Warlord"" comic and the games of toy soldiers we played as children. For ""serious"" wargamers, it's the price of travelling to set up your models, fanny about moving them for six hours then putting them away again and going home afterwards. As someone who's been playing wargames for thirty-five years, I give this little gem nine out of ten. There are one or two things that could be improved (such as speed of movement), but in general I believe that this is great fun for everyone."
76561198008750889,Recommended,287070,28508073,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,ccwylde70,"Two things right off the bat.  1) The game is Awesome !  and 2) The tutorial is Absolutely Horrible.Yes, no typos there, but lemme take a moment to elaborate.  Let's get the tutorial out of the way.Okay, so the tutorial's out of the way.  No, I'm really not kiddin', there's almost zilch, zero nada in the tutorial, and it's set up in a very odd way, with lotsa buttons to attempt to click that do nothing and no helpful guide to any advanced strategies or tactics.  I'm sure there are probably some very helpful guides out there for all those things, but they are definitely NOT in the tutorial.At any rate, I found I could and did learn all I needed to know by going selecting the first campaign at the top and just plunging into the game headfirst.  There was quite a bit of trial-and-error initially, and the game doesn't give you a lot of 'prestige-type-purchasing-power' like you may be used to in games like Panzer General or Panzer Corps.  In fact, once you're in a battle, there's NO accrual of prestige or ability to purchase new units, etc.  You only get options to do that at the start of the missions, but before you throw in the towel on that being a horrible idea, I'll  explain.You'll get a select # of units that are coming on each mission w/o fail and at no cost.  You'll also have a limited amount of purchasing power to add key beneficial units as you see fit, and there are also limitations on just how many of each of those useful units are available as well.  Part of the real challenge in this game is making sacrifices on what you'd RATHER have and what you can AFFORD to have ... these aren't always the same thing.  Example: I'd RATHER have 2 25pdr arty units, and there are 2 available, but I need to have another Sherman Tank instead, or I need another engineering unit and a transport, etc.  You'll quickly start to learn to 'make do' and discover just how much use you can milk out of units you might otherwise completely disregard.It gets better.  The first few missions are pretty easy-breezy.  Then it starts to get tougher.  Then it starts to get A LOT tougher !  At that point, you'll start to think 'there isn't any way I can complete this mission given what I have at my disposal !'  And about the time you think that, reinforcements will start to show up !  I found the pacing of my need for more units vs the actual arrival of new units to be almost hand-to-glove in the first campaign.There are a lot of things to learn, tactically, that will improve your odds of winning.  You'll pick a lot of these up as you play.  Or you can probably track down a guide to learn more about them.  I'm probably running outta room on this review!  Best of luck if you get the game, and Happy Hunting!"

US Rifleman have an advantage over British and German Riflemen thanks to their Garand semi-auto rifles.The Panther tank has excellent front armour, but very poor side armour.The cost is a little extortionate, especially for add-on packs. I'd wait until it's on offer.A lot of fun."

In other words it's easy to learn how to play the game since it only requires the use of the mouse but there are loads of variables in game that make it hard to effective right off the bat (which occurs at realistic difficult, it is definately the difficulty setting you want to stick to)- Replayability in the form of Normandy skirmishes + allied special assaignments + axis special assaignments + if you want to restart every campaign from the beginning upon having completed it.-Sound effects are pretty good in general, love the sound of machine gun fire, rifles shooting, infanrty yelling in their native tounges telling you weather they are suppressed or retreating. They could of done a better job on tank guns however.-Satisfaction is garenteed when you manage to claw victory from the jaws of defeat, or when you destroy superior german armor with weaker allied armor-Tanks have realistic armor values, strongest armor up front, weak on sides, weakest at the rear. You can pivot units on a tile so that they face the enemy with their stongest armor.-Different ""power ups' per level ranging from carpet bombing, to strafing runs, arty strikes, to Medic (being able to heal one dead troop in an infantry squad), to resupply (resupplying AT charges on infantry units that have used them up) etc.-Different maps with different terrain layout in each level-LOS mechanic which is fair, if infantry, Fixed AT are in buildings or bushes they are invisible until they fire repeatedly or are spotted by other infantry. Scouts have longer LOS than other units but aren't that great in combat.-Game braking bugs are non-existant (or rare idk if any one else has run into major problems but my version has run smoothly since I installed it)-scenarios are not too long nor are they too short, about 20-25 mins per scenarios (there is also a save feature if you want to save the current mission you are playing)Cons(some may be pros for certain ppl):-Graphics are hit n miss for some. Meaning some won't mind how it looks while others will find it a bit trash. They're not next gen but they're not that bad.-Power ups mentioned before like Arty strike, strafing runs , bombing runs do not show which tiles they effect. You need to guess where it's gonna hit and place the markers infront of advancing enemies so that they run into the effected area. Some may take serveral turns before they land which is something to consider.-Certain sound assets arent great i.e. tanks fireing, tanks engines, truck engines etc.-Ground forces focus only, you'll never get to fully control Air units or Naval units (you only get to call in air or naval support, you can't control fighter squadrons or ships)-No base building, you only get the units you choose at the start + reinforcements after several turns(in certain scenarios)-In game UI isn't great could definately use more work.-A bit too easy on lower difficulty, and even realistic is a medium challenge at times it does get a lot harder in campaigns like Sea Lion and Market Garden.-The Game is very pricey to get all these expansion campaigns I suggest you wait for a sale since it's with all the campaigns that the game truely shines (it's lack luster in content in vanilla I found)Conclusion: If you enjoy wargames this is deffinately a no brainer,  if you're new to war games Battle Academy is just as accomedating.

It is a mix.  If you find that there are themes in both types that appeal to you, then this game may be quite pleasing.  However, because it is a mixed breed, the game most likely will  not satisfy hard core gamers of either type.2) Type: historical accuracyThis game is a game based on historical events, the second World War.  While nowhere as near as historicaly accurate as a game like Panzer Corps, this game is much better then what you see in most history-based strategy games, especially the ones from this time period.   For example, don't expect to see game play including the Soviet Union nuking Nato powers, Russian soldiers executing Western Allied soldiers (like downed pilots), ect.3) ViabilityThis game has so much content!!! The series also has two games, not one and the first game has more content then most series do.4) FunThis game merges really fun, creative and innovative mechanics while keeping the game historically accurate and realistic.I highly recommend this game to all WWII history fans/gamers, and recommend it to the rest of the gaming community.  This is not the best WWII strategy game out there, not even close, but it's well worth the price tag and will appeal to larger portions of the gaming community."

I am old wargamer and I recommend this to all wargamers. It reminds me old days with Steel Panters II and also Panzer General a bit. There is only one thing I am not sure of. Angle of view for units. Sometimes it happens that I engage tanks from back or side and they are still able to see me and shoot at me. Tanks have poor visibility against infantry and this factor was not really taken into account. However fantastic game....9/10. Will buy also DLC megapack for sure.
