Pure Dopamine! :D*This revitalization of the old classic games like Arkanoid is the very definition of a next-gen game! The best I have ever come across. Amazing job bringing an old game mechanic to a whole new level!* Better go see your doctor before playing it. This game has a strong neuro-active impact on your brain. xD

It was more fun than this."
,Recommended,287120,13404140,"Posted: 16 December, 2014",all,Brezlon,"Ionball 2: Ionstorm - First ImpressionsTo be totally upfront, when the 90's were over I had pretty much stopped playing 2D games. I couldn't really find enjoyment in them anymore. But this game brought me back to what I first loved about them: Simple layout, skill-based focus & a great time sink.What's it like: This game feels like classic Pong-meets-Space-Invaders. You're not so much shooting bullets as 'catching' them via your thrown ball. You need to defend a space tower & destroy some alien vehicles. All the while keeping track of your ionball.Replay: Replay value is good (so far). I've played around 25 different levels of this game and I've found most of them interesting & challenging. When I lose all my lives & it's ""Game Over"" I don't feel utterly beaten & ready to quit. Instead, I feel eager to try again. It encourages me to hone my reflexes and peak my curiosity over what the next level might bring. I feel the end-goal is far less about 'winning' the game, although there is a Leaderboard you can compete in if you want to try.Graphics: Graphics are up to date in this decade, with a 3D-look over a 2D format. There are two viewing/playing options but my fav is Top-Down; in the style of the old arcade shooter/pinball games. I will note that beginner players may easily get confused with all the sparkly bits & lose sight of their fast-moving ball. If you're getting frustrated, turn down the graphics to 'Fastest' & then raise them up later to a fancier setting once you've gotten the hang of the game. Focus first on enjoying & progress, rather than perfection.Controls: From what I've read this game is not compatible with joystick or controller. It is intended to be used with a mouse, and thankfully it works well. You only need to tilt the mouse side to side & left click to fire your first shot at each new level (or use the menu). The great news is it's also a simple one-handed game; so if you've carpal tunnel in one hand you'll still be able to play with the other. Although playing this game with your off-hand will be a good challenge. :)Price: I got it during the holiday sale, so it was under $2 for me. It's easily worth $10, however. If you're not sure that it's even worth $10 then add it to your wishlist & wait for a sale. That said, you may end up feeling like I did though; a bit guilty about getting such a good deal.Saves: This game saves your progress after each completed level, so if you lose all your lives & hit 'Game Over' you can still continue where you left off (although there is a score penalty). You can also opt to start a new game to try to raise your score higher (and reduce your # of deaths.) As said before, the replay value is good.Seizure Warning: I'm sure nearly every fast-paced game on Steam would have this warning but I'll say it anyways. As the levels progress, the game gets far more flashy & intense.If you're prone to intense seizures then LEAVE THIS GAME ALONE - It's not worth the misery. If however, you suffer from very mild seizures and still want to try this game then put all the settings down to minimum, take plenty of breaks & stop if you feel strain or headaches. It's fun to play, but it can get very intense, very quickly.Take care of your health, please.Playstyle Tip: I personally feel this game is meant to be used with peripherial(rod) vision. Focusing straight on the ball (which most people tend to do) may cause you to lose sight of it very quickly as colours & movement clash together. I recommend instead that you relax your eyes & look 'through' the screen about 1 foot behind it - like you would with the old 3D Magic Eye creations. With a bit of practice, this method will give you a wider field of vision & allow you to react faster to changes. It will also reduce the chance of headaches if you're prone to them.Now if you'll excuse me, I shall end this review & go back to playing... :)"

There's too much going on to be honest, not to sound like an old fart.. but it's pretty hard keeping an eye on the ball at all times, because of all the ""effects"" constantly in your face. It's not a bad game, but it's just a bit too much for me personally. Sometimes less is more, like in the original Arkanoid. The ball always being at max speed too doesn't really help with feeling in control, as it just makes it sort of luck based wether or not you can pull through. There's a lot to upgrade and progress in, but to be honest it doesn't help when none of it makes it more controlable in the first place.It's just too fast for my reaction time, and I'm sure there are others who handle it better than me. Can't see myself playing it much."

It was a little annoying at first...Besides, the more you progress, the more weapons and other items you can use (depends on amount of XP). That's really fun, nice for the eye, useful and, moreover, it makes a hard level easy if you play tactical enough.This game comes with a lot of 'eye candy' (and has nice 'ear candy' too), but most annoying was and is the graphical (ball) distraction; it's sometimes too much for the eye...Of course I'd recommend this game, but I won't recommend playing this a couple of hours at once, because it's not a relaxation for your eyes. But I do believe it does learn you to improve your focus and responsiveness :) Good for the brain (CPU), bad for your eyes (GPU)!EDIT: from 7.5 (1st hour) to 8.5/10 (completed)! The more you progress, the more beautiful it all looks and with all those so-called 'Active' and 'Passive' items/weapons, it never bored me :) Variation enough!EDIT_2: the Tower Assault DLC is surprisingly great! It's less difficult due to all the (auto) power-ups, but therefore a feast and just sensational to look at :)"

The sounds and graphics are impressive, but you won't see or hear them because youi'll be concentrating furiously on that green dash that shows you where the ball is -- when it's not hidden behind explosions or other fancy effects.  There's just too much going on to be able to accurately predict where the ball will come out, so whether you hit it or not is a matter of sheer luck. The developers clearly failed to test it on any real people."

Ionball 2 has a campaign mode with upgradable weapons/advantages and the other being a challenge mode, which feels no different but then again I haven't really progress far enough to tell much about it.The only negative thing I can say is the visual might be too much and will probbaly throw you off in the location of the ball but the developers provide you with an option to configure it to your liking. I have no idea what to elaborate on, its a pretty straight foward game. (Nice visual, fun, and simple but yet challenging at times)This would be a great addition to your steam library."

Be warned you can loose track of time in this for sure and the Rock and Dubstep soundtrack is off the chain! This game is different with paddle upgrades and weopons really flips the script for this type of game.WARNING!!! You should know there is a bad bug though! You can still play but you have to be more predictive because off this... If you move your paddle really quick to the far right or left of the screen it will freez about an inch from the edge... this can mean game over in some situations but if your good you can predict where the ball is goin befor it gets there and move your paddle swiftly but not fast and have no problems... but be warned this made it hard for me to play at first, took a lot of practice to stop tryin to fling my paddle from one end of the screen to the other as fast as I could.UPDATE: THEY FIXED THE PADDLE HANGUP GLITCH!!!

(search on google what it is)Interface/Menu/SettingsI personally find the Main menu Music an annnoyance and disturbing.You can slide the music and sound volume with the bar. The % will tell you how high/low it is.You can play this on fullscreen or windows mode.With multiple graphics quality.it has many resolution sizes.There is a leaderboards, but nobody cares i think.There are 2 game modes. ""Endless survival"" and Story mode.About the game.This is a breakout game, you move ur bat and you keep hitting the ball and you have to destroy the enemy ships (instead of blocks). The levels will be harder and harder. But you are able to find some upgrades to your balls or bat. Which will be needed ofcourse. The longer the ball is alive. The higher the bonus but the speed is also increased.There are passives and Activatiable upgrades.You are able to upgrade your balls! HA!!.. and your BAT!! HA!!.. with experience.At the right side you will see ""Codex"". This gives you information about enemies and items.There is a death and a time counter.The ball is highlighted with some Neon Lights.It has Techno/Dance Music.The longer the ball is rolling the bigger your bonus will be. Because the bonus bar is going higher and higher overtime. However the speed of the ball will also be increased overtime.Enemies will drop green chips, which will give you some Experience. So make sure you pick them up with the Bat or you will lose it.If you have run out of lives and you are game over, Your score will be deleted and you get 3 lives again.You get 1 live everytime you beat a level.You get extra bonus score points if you have managed to complete a level without dying.You can choose the level on the current floor, but once beaten you can't redo it.Other things.The game goes quite fast. Im not sure if slower machines would have an advantage coz the game will run slower.I am terrible at this game.The Neon Light from the ball COULD be a distraction or difficult time to follow the ball.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10"

I was on one of my many perusing of sales binges when I came across this game at a steal for about .10-.50c and I would have even paid the full $5 for it if I knew what awesomeness I was purchasing at the time!IONBALL is an amazing brick buster/pong type arcade game that can best be described as DX Ball from the future.... And the future is full of ♥♥♥♥ing wonders, baby.  Now the bricks aren't bricks but robots.  The bat is not just some boring grey line, but a bow-like laser thingy on a mission to infiltrate a space-station.  Don't ask me how the ♥♥♥♥ you infiltrate a space-station by playing space ping-pong with a bunch of droids.  I don't have a friggin' clue...  Not only do the bricks glow with funky colors but they move and shoot things at you to add extra chaos and fun to your gaming experience!  You purchase upgrades for your ""bat,"" instead of all upgrades being drop-downs... so upgrades are permanent as well.  DON'T WORRY, no amount of upgrading will keep this game from being challenging.  All I can say is keep your eyes on the tail of the comet.If you were addicted to DX Ball like a heroin-junky back in the day or even if you were not and are just looking for an awesome arcade experience, this game is for you.

I am not sure what causes it but it still hangs a bit after each level on my high end gaming rig.  Also, lots of unnecessary effects and hardship when switching weapons.  I think that using numbers to choose your weapons would make it a lot easier than having to scroll through and then maybe miss the ball and lose a life while trying to get a weapon selected.

76561198056009372,Not Recommended,287120,20433304,"Posted: 9 January, 2016",all,Arnwyn,"I wanted to like this game, but there were just a few too many problems that makes me just not *quite* able to recommend it. Close... so close.The biggest flaw is (mentioned a few time) - the lack of controller support. This game is really crying out for controller support and Big Screen mode. Other problems include some of the F/X (even when dialed down, the ball trail still makes things a pain to see sometimes), achievements not popping in game (less of a problem, since they all pop at once when you leave the game), lack of explanation of some of the power-ups (Shields? When does my laser come back?), and not-so-good control explanations. There needs to be a mite more power-ups *during* a level, but I can imagine that that might be a design choice (not one I like, but still).Otherwise, there are good ideas here. For example, if you keep the ball in play long enough, there is a blast of energy that wipes out random 'blocks' (enemies) - especially great for when you just can't line up the ball and get that one last lone enemy (absolutely brilliant, and every Arkanoid-type game needs this from now on). The music is good for the type of game, XP-gathering adds an extra dimension, and there's lots of upgrades to buy (keeping one busy gathering XP).A mythical Ionball 3 might be just the ticket to ironing everything out and getting a fantastic block-breaking game."

Paid a couple bucks for it and is well worth it. Kindof reminds me of another game i can not remember the name to, but this one gives you allot more options like add ons, customisable upgrades. Bosses that are actually not easy. right now im stuck actually on quite a large boss with levels of lasers and rockets that bounce off the walls, then the big guy appears after a greuling totrure chamber of weapons shooting at you, there are patterns to most of it, he starts shooting lasers, green and red balls then make sure you have a fully upgraded laser and save a couple of your lives for this guy unless your a master.

76561198077657144,Not Recommended,287120,33201925,Posted: 3 July,all,ShadowRy,"The glow of the ball and the paddle make tracking both difficult, especially during squences when everything is exploding. I frequently lost balls to the narrow gap between my paddle and the wall because said glow made both the ball and the paddle seem bigger. Often times, the movement of the ball (when you can track it) is random and unpredictable unlike other ""Breakout"" type games. Several mechanics are unnessasarily complicated and the two boss levels I got through felt cheap and gimmicky. Having to collect exp that falls from killed bots while also keeping your ball up slows upgrade progress because it's frequently impossible to do both.Might be worth it to some, but I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it. Even after paying only $0.74 I still requested a refund."

The controls are sluggish, sticky, and at most times, unresponsive rendering the game unplayable. This is pretty sad, becasue the whole objective of the game is to move a platform to the left, or to the right. How can you possibly screw that up."

One thing to note is that you play the game as a ""run"" for a leaderboard score while upgrading your stuff. You cannot replay levels at all until you finish and/or reset the tower to start all over, and there is no replay-on-demand of any levels, which I am not a fan of. You can only play levels you have not completed yet in your ""run"".If you are more of a casual breakout fan I wouldnot recommend.As an example of my preference I would prefer a breakout game such as Ricochet: Lost Worlds that I played years ago."
,Not Recommended,287120,29852963,Posted: 11 February,all,Fire'sLight(Dr.CoolCat),"So far my only complaint with the game is, 1. It doesn't really work with a 2/3 monitor setup and 2. You can't precisely move. If you try to slide the paddle a nudge to the left It will remain where it is, so basically if the ball is next to the paddle, you lose a life. I hope that gets fixed I really don't understand why there is a threshold on the movement... without a controller... however everthing else is amazing. I just can't recommend the game untill that gets fixed."
