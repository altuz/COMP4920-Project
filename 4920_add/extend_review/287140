An idea is most certainly present, however it's more of an outline that fails to guide the player through the process of filling it out. In other words - filling it out becomes very boring, very fast. What, at first, seemed like a horrifying and story-rich experience quickly turned into a monotonous chore consisting of ""What the hell do I do now"" and ""WTF"" moments. I don't recommend this at any price, except if it seems interesting to you. But be warned - it's not as interesting as it seems. At all."

Selfie is not very good, but it is also brutal and depressing and uplifting and everything like that. Maybe by pure accident, RSG has managed to make the closest thing to actual art a videogame has ever been. When you fly around in space, you'll find bottles, each containing the deep fears and secrets of other players. People are incredibly, shockingly honest in these things. People with genuine, real problems that they put into a bottle in a budget art game for anyone to see and write back messages of encouragement, telling them it's OK to be afraid or to doubt god or to have been molested as a child. Of course, none of that really has anything to do with with RSG himself, because the things he was responsble for making are, as is traditional, janky as♥♥♥♥♥♥and probably not very good.

Players have the choice of condemning or freeing others, and can leave messages for them in response. If this sounds like an interesting experience for you, then I highly recommend this game.

From the very moment you open the game you are introduced to the plot, in a unique and very fascinating way, as intentionally indirect as it is, it immediately enthralled me and pushed me to keep playing and learn more about what I was seeing, and how it should make me feel.Even right now as I write this, the music that accompanies you in space in Selfie is playing through my headphones, urging me to try and explain the emotions that it brings up in me as I drift through the empty lonliness of space.Something incredible and unique to this game is how personalized it's already becoming, with only having been out two days, I've already read messages from real other people saying things like ' 'Every day i want to die. I can never feel better, i can never end this.'.. even if this is a joke to them, and they wrote it in jest, I still read it as quite a personal expression of how they felt, and couldn't even bring myself to jokingly 'condemn' them for it, leaving myself to have to compose a message back to them.. I've seen many messages like this now, and it's incredible to see the emotions people are willing to share in this void of space...

Not only will you receive hearthwarming responses, wandering through space, barely noticing the small bottles which include big issues puts everything into perspective, you enter some sort of therapy where you start seeing your problems as something smaller, they're insignificant in this huge space.Interesting concept, completely different from anything you'll play.In case you can't get past the first part, which has vague instructions to say the least, you're supposed to focus on 6 different flies with right mouse button, this will turn the TV on, after it does, switch through channels until you get one channel which is different from the others and focus on it, you'll be taken into the space part"

It's quite fascinating really, and I can see it being very empowering to those who need it.---------------v--EDIT--v---------------This is truly an EXCELLENT idea. However,1) it would be sooo much nicer if it was implemented smoother. Guide the player a little more - hint at them to explore the unknown so that they will come across the bottles.2) there would SO many more players, if the above were true, and also if it was easier to get around space, or at least, if things were closer together. It's hard to manouver around, and at times it almost doesn't feel worth it to reach out to that next bottle... though I really, really want to. Make it easier for us to reach the bottles, people need this.3) would it be possible to change the code so that we won't come across the same message multiple times?

Just sayin'To conclude it shorly, Selfie: Sisters of the Amniotic Lens is barely a game. It is potentially a life-changer, which can be far more interesting if you as me.Many here said similar things and I would say it as well, this is more of an experience rather than a video game.These are the exact words from another review here, actually, and as soon as I read that line I figured I have to try this game out, even though it wasn't discounted (and I usually buy discounted games) but for just 5$... I didn't mind giving it a shot. And eventually I believe it was worth it.Not everyone would enjoy this ""game"" obviously.This title is for whoever whishes to have a glimpse into others' souls, and also open a window of their own for others to see. You wouldn't find a ""walkthrough"" for this game, there's not much gameplay here, but whatever gameplay that does exist is actually rather frustrating, so, make sure you reach that part I've just mentioned because that's what makes Selfie so good! Don't get frustrated too soon by the flies-shooting part! (I certainly did)There's some (very) minor gameplay as I said, and a rather abstract back story which I didn't yet complete and didn't find myself too intrigued by. I wouldn't write here exactly what you're supposed to do because every ""official"" review has described exactly every step you need to do.There's not much content and it all gets very repetitive.Yet it feels good, it gives you a chance to open your heart to complete strangers and see what their reactions may be.And you can react to others opening their hearts, with the potential of making someone's day better. You wouldn't know if you did, though. Everything is done anonymously, no one can respond to your reactions. And you cannot respond to the reactions you'd get from others. And that's part of the magic.On the technical side this game is not that good, not that it matters much with so little gameplay. It only makes me fear a little for my privacy, but I hope and believe there's no actual threat in here.In short, if you can stand a rather bizarre experience (Personally I like these things so much!) and have an open mind regarding this one, you can have good time with Selfie. You wouldn't necessarily ""enjoy"" it, so to speak. But it can give you a good feeling at time, and heck, even a bad feeling, which is still impressive when invoked by a video game. If you're lucky it could even give you some interesting insights and become a life-changer for you."

Then, again, I did not know what to do... Looked it up, and back to the game. Not so long after that, again, I had to look up what the heck I'm doing... Suddenly I'm back to where I started... Looked it up, and looks like I have to do the same boring thing 2 more times...I don't see what the point or the goal is... It might be a social experiment, It might be a different kind of social network, it might be whatever each and everyone wants it to be. Whatever it is, not expailing (or being obvious enough) how it works is not my cup of tea. Furthermore doing the same thing over and over is nothing more than boring.I apreciate the experimentation, but not the result."
