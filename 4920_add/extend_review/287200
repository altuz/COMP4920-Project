,Recommended,287200,10101662,"Posted: 13 May, 2014",all,J102y,"The obvious Error on release aside. Wildlife Park 3 is actually a pretty enjoyable Tycoon game. Whilst it's no Zoo Tycoon 2 beater, It definately holds its own in the Zoo Management genre, and is definately better than the recent Zoo Tycoon effort that was released on 360/Xbone which is a pretty poor Zoo Tycoon game considering the title its meant to live up to.Being a fan of this genre though, I thoroughly enjoy this game thus far, whilst I'm not expecting any expansions or miracles etc, I think its a damn good attempt at the Zoo management effort. The variation on the animals is a pretty neat idea, For those that have Played Zoo Tycoon 2, they will know that having 8 Elephants that all look the same can look like a copy/paste effort. I find the overall experience exactly what you'd expect from a game like Wildlife Park 3.If people can overlook the negative reviews about the game considering they all pertain to the error which has since been fixed and won't happen again, It's definately worth grabbing a copy to waste a few hours."
,Not Recommended,287200,32354689,Posted: 11 June,all,Beelzeboss,"I loved Wildlife Park 2. It probably is the next best zoo management game after Zoo Tycoon series. So, despite the negative reviews, I gave this one a shot. I thought that WP2 has negative reviews as well but that is a damn fine game. Maybe it's the same with WP3. Played it for a while, doing some campaigns to get the basics of WP3 and then started playing freemode. Here is my overall impression -Pros+ Runs on Windows 10. At least it worked for me.+ Much better-looking than WP2. The animal textures, terrain, trees etc. everything looks really good.+ You don't just buy workers. You hire them. They all have Stars to indicate their performance. Hence, workers don't require their own building like in WP2. Work area has a larger radius and can be increased where in WP2 workers already has the max radius set which is not that big, you could only decrease it and then increase it again if needed in WP2. This is not the case with this game.+ Everything is sorted in different categories, unlike WP2 where there was no sorting option.+ Realistic AI.Meh+/- UI isn't very good. Things are sorted into different categories, yes. But the texts on tooltip have weird colors. WP2 has a simple UI, but it will take a bit time to get used to this one if you have played WP2. I felt really uncomfortable with the overall UI at first.+/- Saving system is a bit confusing at first. I thought I lost my campaign progress after I started playing freeplay mode.Cons- Performance is REALLY bad. Worse than WP2. Even with a high performance PC the FPS goes down really hard after you start expanding the zoo or during different weather effect animation.. In case of WP2, it's kinda okay because it's very old. But WP3 was released not very long ago compared to WP2. To be honest, WP2 run BETTER than WP3. Funny thing is, devs decided to release a DLC, but ignoring to fix the performance issue which is mentioned several times in the community discussion. Even I have posted about it and got no reply. This is the third game of this franchise, yet the worst compared to the previous games of this series.- Limited animal variety. This might not be a con for you though.- Poor tutorial system. It does not clearly say what you will need to do next. It does explain why you need to do this and that, but fails to show you how.- Every map feels really smalls after you put a few enclosures. You will have trouble regarding space. Visitors want to see more animals, yet there ain't enough space to add more.- Every time I want to see the detailed information of something, another preview window opens and I have to close it every time. This might not be a problem for you, but in WP2 it was really simple to check information so I find this system in WP3 very annoying.- Music is just annoying and repetitive. I had to turn it off.- The whole game just doesn't feel fun. If you have played WP2 and loved that, then you might not like the gameplay on this one, except for few people maybe.I really wanted to love this game but it just fails on so many levels. It has it's charm but very little and it gets boring very fast. If you want to play this series, then just get the previous titles."

The limited animal selection is boring, the campaignes are tedious, and the park leveling system is incredibly stressful.The interface is also incredibly complicated and awkward to use. The music is monotonous and the voice acting incredibly tacky.If you want a time decently fun time waster, I'd say you could go for this game. Definitely only get this game if it's on sale, though. I got it for around $3 and I'm glad I didn't spend any more. It's not worth $10."

DO NOT BOTHER. It's obvious the Devs gave up on this very quickly and didn't bother making any DLC.  Animal choice is quite limited, very very very few mods at all and its just glitch-fest 2016.If you really want to play a zoo game i'd recommend the first WP for its easy but replayable game that has plenty of mods OR the more popular WP2 which in my opinion is the best out of all the WP's but for the love of god don't waste your money on this game because you'll either end up requesting a refund or wishing you had."

I'm only using this as an advanced tamagotchi, i could care less about people coming in to enjoy the park. I enjoy taking care of the animals and watching them have fun and play. Going into it is kinda confusing because the HUD is small and mashed up, But after awhile you get used to it. I havent experienced errors or glitches. 7/10."

It has it's flaws like poor ""decor"" choices, silly animal models, boring people models, and the inablity to move bought buildings/plants/decor after placing them.  I enjoy raising the animals, running a ""zoo"" and zooming in on the animals to take screenshots.  The campaign is challenging at times and will give you rewards for your park.  There's a bunch of maps to make more parks on which is good for replay value.  You can also make multiple accounts ingame to play over and over or just reset the campaign levels.  In all honesty, at $10 for full price it's good, but if you can get it on sale it's even more worth the money!"
,Recommended,287200,10106103,"Posted: 13 May, 2014",all,Zane Thanatos,"Ignoring the error that prevented people from playing at launch, the overall game itself is solid. It is not optimized terribly well (highest graphics settings had my FPS ~5-10 and my GPU was barely being used). How employees function is poorly thought out (they are stuck in one square area around their placement and don't roam the park). But all in all it's a pretty decent tycoon game at this price point."
,Not Recommended,287200,12303146,"Posted: 30 September, 2014",all,JP Biscuit,"After about a couple of hours of gameplay and completing the tutorial and several missions, I want to weigh in on what this game has to offer.Others have covered some of these points already, but I'll summarize the biggest shortcoming as thus:The overall aesthetic design of this game is atrocious.The graphic design seen in the UI, main menu, even to the closing screen, are amateurish at best, I prefer the UI in Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, and that game is over a decade old. If you're prone to frustration, you will most likely give yourself a headache trying to figure out this clunky and dated interface. I still haven't figured out where (Or if) it tells you how much a purchase will cost before buying it.On the bright side, the actual game itself can be beautiful at times. The screenshots are pretty true to the game.However, don't expect it to go much farther than that. The gameplay grows shallow after little play. Once you set up an initial enclosure, it's hard to care much more about it as there's little else to do besides make it prettier or bigger. Training of the animals is gone, there's so few of them that you run out of combinations of species to set up in one enclosure, and the only visitor attractions you can really build are safaris (Jeep and rail) and air tours.Everything else, as far as the small bugs go, pales in comparison to the sheer lack of gameplay that can be found in this.Don't get me wrong, what's actually done in this game is done fairly well, but the game is not worth the 10$ pricetag, not when you can pick up the 1st Zoo Tycoon ultimate edition for the same price at the time of writing.I bought it at 3.40$, and I feel like that was fair, I got what I paid for, but do not purchase this game fullprice, it's simply not worth it, and it pales in comparison to the previous Zoo Tycoons, and even the previous Wildlife Park 2, which is a complete shame, as this market is absolutely starved of games like this. There's only a handful of games which can liken themselves to the same genre, and what is there pales in comparison to what came before it."
,Not Recommended,287200,26023435,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,OctarineDream,"The Good:   Sometime I like making animal pens and just watching them exist because the varying skins at least make them interesting to look at.The Bad:     Pretty much everything else. The controls are bad. The instructions are really really bad. The story is boring and the game mode is literally painful to complete as fuctions are locked outside of your tasks. So if you need to wait until animals are all trained to a certain level or have a number of offspring you are mostly stuck with what you have. No making a cool zoo while you wait. Sandbox mode is less painful but animals, plants and visitors all have very strict requirements and with a very limited number of items to chose from you will soon give up on any attempts at fun or creativity.  You also can't mange many fuctions yourself. Animal needs feeding? You must hire a zoo keeper who will spend the majority of their day standing stock still. Plants need watering? Well you are going to need a groundskeeper full time to do that every so often."

There also seems to be a lmit on visitors allowed in the park at one time, people complaining that they won't enter the park as it's too busy... Also very annoying as the park looks empty. Once you get to end game (all animals) people don't seem interested in coming anymore, which suck on the second to last mission as you need to earn 100000, 3000 on facilities and 3000 on tickets...Despite this it's worth playing but gets boring at the end, maybe more choice of freeplay maps, more animals, decorations and facilities (or just start all-ready on the expansion packs)."

The terrain even affects your animals happiness.Animal management - You dont just place animals and watch them , you actually have to design their pens to keep them happy which is cool.CONSRotating and making items line up to 90 degree angles is a pain. their might be an easy way to do this with a hot key but the tutorial didnt explain how to do it.Selling Animals is kind of a pain when you have a bunch.

,Not Recommended,287200,10412486,"Posted: 9 June, 2014",all,Leaceslife,"I strongly wished to be totally enthralled with this game.  There is a serious deficit of this particular Genre in this style format and they just happen to be the style of games I love best.There were a few good notes.  The graphics were decent even on Medium setting. I liked the use of different emoticons to identify problem animals, guests and plants.  And I liked the way the ride designer would automatically navigate around obstacles making for relatively easy placement of the ride features.However, there are some issues with the level designs.  The boarders of the parks do not always permit you to build to the wall (which is the most affordable method when starting out).  The level challenges started off interesting with a semblance of story but the story fell off quickly and degraded into ""Oh, I need a campaign task here..."" with no consideration of the previous campaign nor returning to the players own park as part of the campaign.   Also The landscaping features are not adequately user friendly and it take allot of patience to get some special need animal enclosures to function correct.  A final criticism is with the ""Workers"".  The place and adjust area works good for the Gardner's and Keepers as it makes logical sense for the style of work they do, however, the Vets and Garbage-men seemed to be wasting allot of logical coverage ability for the style of work they would be performing.  All this combined with the limited items and animals made for some dry and fustrating game play which made the sandbox mode very...Over all it was an okay game...and I will continue to play it...but I wish I had NOT spent more than 5 bucks on it."

(hint hint to the devs, not that they respond)2: the keepers, in zoo tycoon you could assign a keeper to a fenced area , it just needed to be closed, otherwise they did the whole zoo, here you just expand their range, and if your enclosure is to big, or not in the shape of their range, to bad hire another one to cover the hole enclosure. annoying much (hint hint to the devs, not that they respond)3: taking care of plants aaaaarg so annoying, i wish you could turn that off, ok that a plant needs it's right temperature and soil i understand but watering them? really? plant diseases you can turn of no complaints there.the animations and graphics are good,and i have no complaint's about the animals they look good.it could use more animals though, not a disaster that there are not that much animals hence why it is not a reason of my complaintsthe other thing is it is taking them so long to update their game, ok it has dino's now, BUT the game came out in 2014 and it is 2017 now really it took that long to do one thing?*clap, clap* wow, good job devsi know enough games whose devs try hard to make the game fun, to know that this game does not belong on that list, right now it is catching virtual dust in my game collection list.no, not the best, but if you like half baked games go ahead and buy it.i love animal games (i played zoo tycoon so much that i can't even count the hours)i have waited many years to write a review, thinking if i wait i can write a good one, not.that was giving myself false hope.it will change if the game gets updated for the better but for now, DON'T BUY"

I'm not too fond of the food supply system in the previous games, glad they got rid of that. I'd recommend this game if you enjoy similiar titles, but it isn't nearly as engaging as it could be. The lack of freedom and the rigidity of the game's UI really hold it back."

,Recommended,287200,20315550,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,Ossiekins,"I really like this game the best out of the three Wildlife Park games. I like that the staff aren't in towers like in WP2. I find it a lot easier to play than the others. I can't really think of much to complain about it. It'd be nice if the paths could be placed in a more straight line or just not be able to be placed near plants, since that always messes things up for me. I've really enjoyed playing the campaigns though. They're challenging, but not enough so that I just get frustrated and never try again. I always struggled with the ones on Zoo Tycoon, but that may have been due to how old I was at the time.I don't like how the animals get upset by their numbers and that you can't even expand the area to make them happier...or maybe you can and I just don't expand it large enough. Either way, for anyone that likes zoo games and is looking at the Wild Life Park ones, I would reccommend this one over the other two. The first one isn't bad, but I really dislike the second one."

However, I found this one absolutely unplayable. No matter what I did, I could not get this game to do more than chug at 10 fps when I moved the camera. I'm often rather fond of clunky UI, but this one had the distinct air of someone not caring about the actual game. The animals looked nice, I liked where they were going with it, but it's so poorly optimised that even on the lowest of the low settings, my laptop, which can easily run Skyrim, struggles, even with a frame limiter on to try to give it some easier time of it. I hate to give this game a bad review, but if you have Windows 10, good luck, mate, because it wouldn't work for me. The purple glitch at the beginning of the game should have given me a hint of the times to come, when it nearly refused to change resolution into something my computer agreed with, but I tried it, and I wanted to love it... but I just couldn't. I nearly got motion sickness just trying to move the camera."

The animals look so realistic and act just like they would in real life. I fully enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone who loves animals and managing a zoo.It is very similar to Zoo Tycoon 2 but includes many more amazing features, such as: having to care for plants (not just animals), animals arent always up for adoption and sometimes you have to wait, animals have ages, etc.I love this game and strongly recommend it!"

Whilst most may argue that this is a step back from 2, both gameplay and visual wise, I absoulutley love this game. I find myself always coming back to this game. Say what you want about it, but if you are someone who likes the classic zoo tycoon game, I definetley reccomend both this game and it's series."

Just dont, If you have ever played Wildlife Park 1 or 2 or even haven't played them,!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!The controles are SO hard to understand, And hard to see. They are like white with white writing. The graphics are good but.... its just to, idk kidish for me.. Like no depth or something. Plus the fact that you get seriously.... 5 animals. I don't understand how to buy anymore the controls are that bad. I'm sure going through the missions and stuff It will tell you but I mean come one who wants to do missions for the next week to understand what any of the controls mean. If you haven't played any of the wildlife Park 1 or 2 and your looking for something like zoo tycoon or anything go with Wildlife Park 2, you will love it. Its a great game. The graphics might not be the greatest but they are not terrible or hard to see or anything. I highly recomend Wildlife Park 2... Don't buy this garbage."

The game drops frames in a small Zoo and is unbearable in a large one - the UI is clunky and difficult to understand - at first. This game could have been great. The animals look great, and the environments look decent. But it isn't, the game is frustrating because of the many poor design choices that were used.If you want to buy this, don't. It isn't worth the hassle.If you wanted to know my Specs:GPU: GTX 1050TICPU: I3 7100RAM: 8GB DDR4STORAGE: HDD 1TBAs you can see, if have FAR above recommended settings, and the game still runs awfully. Some people even get huge frame drops on machines with a 1080 and an I7, and it is really sad as the game could really have been fun. Hopefully a new game of this style is released in the near future."
