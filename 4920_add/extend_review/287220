But what disappointed me the most out this was that the game seems to be abandoned, with no new updates for nearly five months.In all, this game had potential in it's earlier stages, but nothing was done with it and it ended up bland and no different than any other game. If any new updates come out after this review, I will re-evaluate my review accordingly."

If you enjoy getting creative in order to solve puzzles, or just like fooling around with different contraptions on sandbox then I'd recommend this title, especially at its reasonable price."

This means you will fly through the levels and then try and get challanges complete for the level. Such as get the star or do it in 5 seconds. Building a craft is pretty much all of the game and well done. You are not stopped from none standard part placement which is a key element that I enjoy but got turned away from in robocraft.

There are challenges for you to solve with limited amounts of parts, and there is a sandbox where you have unlimited amounts of everything (some things you have to unlock).

This opportunity would make the sandbox even funnier and give a lot more opportunities for the campaign to achieve victory!But don't get me wrong, I realise how hard this is to program, and it is just a suggestion if the developpers have A LOT of time on their hands!However to conclude on a positive note: should you buy this game? YES YES YES MULTIPLES TIME YES! I am in love! Keep it going!"

For instance, when you save a creation and quit sandbox mode, the structure will be deleted. Also the framerate will prgressively get worse while you play and can only be remedied by exiting to the main menu. Finally, the menu does not show all the possible items you can use, several are hidden from sight by the scroll bar. hopefully these bugs will be fixed, and I know they will. overall though the game surpasses expectations, Good Work!"

Especially compared to other simulators out there. This game does not, and I do not expect it to merit costing any money after it passes it's early access stages. If you're looking for something like this, but has so much more, I simply recommend sticking with a studio that has a better reputation and a better game under it's belt such as Space Engineers."

This is basically Bad Piggies in 3d.Once they iron out assigning keys to parts and fix the physics and part placement so that parts rotate about the same pivot point, this will be fun. At the moment it's a little frustrating.One to keep an eye on though."

At present, there's nothing to justify spending $10 on this game, so don't do that unless you're very dedicated to supporting the developers. The last news update seems to have been in August 2015 as of now (I'm writing this in late November). I got the game on sale for less than $3, and sure, it's worth something around that price. You've almost certainly seen games like this before. It's a 'physics sandbox' in which you craft vehicles, and then pilot them through increasingly complex obstacle courses (there's also a sandbox mode with no goals except those you impose yourself). The graphics are minimalist; I like the style, but the game has not been optimized, and runs quite slowly for its appearance. It's... alright. I'm curious to see where it leads, but there's certainly tons of work left before it's a complete enjoyable game."

Well, story, or rather it doesn't really have one of those. Autocraft is primarily a Sandbox (which is nice!) that has levels where you must get your little generic spaceperson to the goal. You can drive him there, fly via boosters, rockets, props and wings.. whatever floats your spaceboat! It's comparable to.. Beseige in that sense.Sandbox mode has 4 'worlds' but everyone uses the green mountains. Not only are they attractive, but also varied in obstacles, and, if you choose either 'Deep Space' or the mega-course-whatever-it's-called, you're inventory screen will be MESSED UP... So build something nice in the mountains, then load it into Deep Space just for flying around :).I enjoy simple block-buildiers in that I can build a vehicle in a few minutes then tune as I go, rather than spend an hour just to make one thing, so AC has been on my list for a while. It's not that polished-looking one, or the army-knife of block builders, but for $7.00 or so it can be part of the pile... collection :)."

I really can't say I notice much of a difference between this version and the first version I played back in 2015. It's just another case of an Early Access title being abandoned before full release. It's a shame, I saw a lot of potential in this.Now that I have that out of the way, Let's talk about the pros of this game. First of all, the art style. It's one off the best I've seen in a while, it's very unique, and the simplistic textures are compensated by the good models. The levels are fun, the perfect balance of difficulty. The sandbox is fun for the first few minutes, but gets boring eventually when you run out of ideas. There aren't really enough levels to compensate for that time either.To sum it up:Pros:-Good Art style-Challenging levels-Unique but familiar game mechanics-Wide variety of partsCons:-It appears it's completely abandoned-Sandbox gets boring after a while-There aren't too many levels to compensate for the boring sandbox-The levels are a little repetitive-It doesn't bring anything new to the genreIf you want something like this, get Space Engineers or Kerbal Space Program.
