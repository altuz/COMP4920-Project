If you enjoyed playing micromachines 'way back then' you will instantly feel right at home with Toybox Turbos. The main singleplayer mode is pretty fun and gets you accustomed with the gameplay pretty quickly but it does feel like they could have done a bit more with it.The main fun of this game comes from the elimination multiplayer which can be played against the AI, up to 4 friends on the same screen or online. What's better is that you can party up with two or three friends on one screen and play online with other opponents.Matchmaking works pretty well. Haven't really had any connection issues connecting to other players and the game is mostly lag free. The few times the lag was noticeable, it was relatively miniscule and never really affected the races.Overall a surprisingly well put together game that captures the feel and the nostalgia of the old Micromachine games."

I finished it in less than four hours, which is something to be aware of.I also found online to be a little bit buggy and laggy, though this could have been my connection rather than a server side issue. I'd have to play more to find out.I haven't played local multi-player yet but it should be a hoot!If you're not sure, try the demo.  For me it turned this game from a 'wait until it's on sale' to a 'I need this right now!'It may be a short and quite simple game, but it's very, very sweet.I can't wait to get this game on with three other peeps, it'll be an absolute blast!"

I have to say: Forget the successor! This game, Toybox Tubos is better in many ways, e.g. a single player carreer mode, unlocking of new cars and a much better long time motivation. Besides it also allows you to have these magic couch sessions with your friends which can ruin friendships. The successor has no career mode, no car unlocking, no collector motivation... If you are looking for an amazing MM game, this is the way to go. Too bad Codemasters could not live up to the expectations with the next MM release :-(So far Toybox Turbos is a much better game!"

Graphics are spot on, handling is just right, difficulty has challenge without being too hard. Features 4-player local/online multiplayer with plenty of options and tracks. Also top-down retro view for fans of the old Micro Machines games. Would recommend to people who like fun!I've spent the past year looking for modern-day Micro Machines-alikes but nothing comes close to the originals, I found myself replaying those instead. When I saw that CodeMasters were making a new game (albeit with the license), I was incredibly excited but also very weary. Turns out though, that it's a fantastic little game.The difficulty is not overboard like the old ones tended to be but still challenging enough, I often found myself tantilisingly close to a higher place on the online leaderboards too, which added some extra life and replayability to the game.I realised all too late that you were able to change the camera view to a retro-topdown one but I was surprised actually by how much the new camera view suited the game, I'm usually strictly retro-isometric but I'd happily play this game as-is!Altogether, this is a well put together title which has clearly had some love lavished upon it, especially considering the low pricepoint. You aren't paying the triple-A money of the original games but you certainly get the quality. The graphics are just right, the handling is great and there are several noticably nice touches in the track design.I've yet to try out the multiplayer but that is usually where Micro Machines games shone so I have no real worries there."

,Recommended,287260,16369402,"Posted: 13 June, 2015",all,Neith (SectionSkyly),"Toybox Turbos is essentially a rebooted version of the old Micro Machines games in all bar the name. These were fantastic top-down view racing games that used everyday locations to create the race tracks. Toybox Turbos continues that trend and adds vibrant levels with plenty of new obstacles to make things more interesting (or irritating, depending on your preference).The game modes are split into Classic (a simple race to the finish line), Escape (outrun a wall of death for as long as you can), Time Trial (complete a number of laps with no competitors as fast as you can), Overtake (as the name suggests, overtake as many AI cars as you can in the time limit) and Elimination which is typically a boss battle. On these the goal is to either destroy your opponent or get far enough ahead that they fall off the screen. Both players start at 5/10 points and you gain a point for getting ahead/lose a point for falling behind. First to 10 wins. These can be a bit irritating if you use the classic top-down view as you often can't see far enough ahead to dodge obstacles in time. Still, it's a minor flaw.I've not tried the multiplayer yet but the single player is great even on its own. If you're looking for a casual, fun to play racer in the vein of Mario Kart and/or were a fan of the original Micro Machines games then do yourself a favour and pick this up. Great little game.

First of all, the advertising for this game was nonexistence. This is basically Micro Machines (MM), mostly a solid remake of the PSO MM V3 version. The original MM video game series was Codemasters most successful installment during the glorious generation of 16-bit consoles in the 90s. Nowadays they produce professional racing games like Grid, DiRt and Formula One. It seems like someone at Codemasters feared a loss of reputation by releasing a fun racer like this but still smelled the extra cash that is to be found here. The game itself is technically absolutely first class. I discovered no bugs so far, the game flow is steady and controls are fine. But after inspecting the surface you can almost feel that this child has been abandonded half the way. It has that ""get this one done ASAP!"" feeling all around. There are some missing features from the original series: no Time Trials, very short tracks, only one multiplayer mode. Online multiplayer feels almost absent. You may play online: but there no one ever around. But after all these negatives one can say this game revives the old spirit very well. The game is charming you right from the start with its colorful and vivid graphic and the easy listening music. The racing tracks feature some funny themes and once the race starts everything gets instantly hysterical. After all this is a easy-to-pickup-game to race several rounds and put it aside after. Do not expect hours of excitement in single player. It is quite uncompetetive. If you can gather some friends locally this rather will provide its real potential. If you are unsure if you want to buy this, play the provided demo. The business department of Codemasters will see this product as cashcow, for the case they require quick cash. So I bet you will see this game in 2-3 months in sale for a nice discount. Just stay patient ;)"

,Recommended,287260,16385165,"Posted: 14 June, 2015",all,OnceMoreIntoTheBreach,"Toybox Turbos is a fun little arcade racer and spiritual successor to the classic Micro Machines. There's a nice selection of vehicles ranging from cement mixers to moon buggies and around 7 exquisitely designed environments for you to traverse in about 5 or 6 different game modes. That really is the biggest draw for this game, racing around these wonderfully crafted cartoon environments feels fantastic and it's hard not to be distracted at times trying to take in all the details crammed into each course. The vehicles all handle differently and there's definitely a degree of strategy in selecting the right vehicle for each race but experienced players shouldn't have too much difficulty achieving gold medals in every event. Overall I played for about 5 hours and managed to 100% the game so if single player length is an important factor to you be aware of the relatively short playtime. Big WARNING though, multiplayer is a shell of the single player with just a single game mode available, Elimination, with up to 4 players. This didn't bother me as I mainly bought the game for the single player experience but for those hoping this will provide a compelling online experience, look elsewhere.I loved my time with Toybox Turbos and for the sale price I paid for it I would absolutely consider it money well spent. I'll probably dive back in every now and then to improve my times but for most part I've had my fill."

,Recommended,287260,12977192,"Posted: 16 November, 2014",all,BOYD1981,"Toybox Turbos has all the heart of Micro Machines but very little of the soul.The single player mode offers very little challenge and the tracks are far too short, there are irritating filler modes such as Escape where you have to stay ahead of a wall of blue deathy stuff for a certain distance. Countdown in which you start off with little time and have to collect clocks to get more time BUT you must cross the finish line on your last lap with a certain amount of time to get Gold. And then there's Overtake which is the most stupid mode; you have to overtake a certain number of AI vehicles within the lap limit.Boss battles are the only time in the single player game that the classic 'Elimination' mode is utilised in which you either destroy your opponent or gain enough lead on them that they are off the screen.Physics are a little too floaty at times and you'll be frustrated by the amount of time it takes to right your vehicle if you're knocked over and there's no button to quickly reset your car.Track design is a little too simplistic, they're all too short and all of them taking place indoors. Beating the single player mode enables mirror mode in multiplayer but it would have been nice to vary things in single player with mirrored tracks.Vehicle types are really limited (there are no water based vehicles) and the weapons are fairly boring and useless.You do get a feeling that Codemasters made this game with tons of DLC in mind which, if is the case, I think they have perhaps shot themselves in the foot for not offering a more stripped down version of the base game as a free starter pack. But the asking price isn't actually that bad and there is fun to be had.I think multiplayer is where this game will really shine but I don't except the flame to burn that long and wouldn't be surprised to see this game heavily discounted in the coming months.Final verdict? A fun but very short lived spiritual successor to Micro Machines with too little of the actual spirit."

The game provides 35 cars and 18 tracks and there are various game modes but they are for single player only. For some reason multiplayer has Elimination mode for both local and online multiplayer.The game has 7 tiers of cars, the first tiers are a bunch of taxi, london cab and buses while the second tier are a set of off road vehicle which provide SUV, moon buggy and even a monster truck. The cars gets faster every tier, the final tier of cars are race cars which provides a classic F1 car, dragster, sportscar (which looks exactly like a low poly GRID 1 and GRID Autosport drift Mazda RX7) and a hot hatchback.The cars feels very floaty and all of them drive similarly, they are a bunch of Micro Machine scale toy.In the single player mode, there a total of 7 cup and each cup has 5 race. Each cup are restricted to specific tiers of vehicle and specific set of races. There are 6 type of game modes here, Classic Racing, Overtake (like the ones in GRID 2), Escape, Elimination, Time Trial and Countdown.Classic Racing also includes weapons, weapons can be used to overcome your opponent. There are a few weapons in the game such as hammers, EMP, rifle, turbo boost, mine and magnets. Magnets could pull you closer to your opponent cars, hammers lets you wreck your opponent cars and EMP could slow down the cars around you.Overtake mode requires the player to overtake a bunch of cars around the track which acts like traffic. The player wins by overtaking an amount of cars set by the game.Escape mode has a wave of water or force field like thing chasing behind you, the player requires to drive the furthest distance possible before your car being covered the water or force field.Elimination mode is also the boss race in the single player mode, weapons are provided in this game mode as well. This mode plays a bit like NFS Underground 2 outrun mode, the player requires to drive as fast as possible until your opponent car is not seen on the screen and the player loses when the car is not seen in the screen, got destroyed by weapons or flew off the track. A score is given when the player wins and 1 score taken away when you lose, the player win this race by filling up the score bar. If the race takes too long to end with constant plus and minus 1 score from you and the opponent, the game will starts putting mines around the track and losing will no longer deduct a score but every win still adds 1 score.Time Trial mode ask the player to clock the fastest time on the track but the tracks has mines to disrupt your racing line.Countdown mode is similar to Time Trial mode, the tracks has mines placed around it as well. The difference is the player requires to pick up ""clocks"" to add time to their timer, the player lose when the timer ran out of time and wins by reaching the finish line with most time left.The single player AI starts off to be very easy and they dont seem to use the weapons they pick up at all but it gets better and faster as you progress through the cups.One of the problem for the single player is the lack of proper quick race mode, you cant pick a set of cars and track combination you wanted to do a race or any other mode. The special game modes are restricted to the ""Single Player"" section which act as the career but the local multiplayer can be used as a ""quick race"" mode. You could start a local lobby yourself and the game will fill the opponent with AI, you could chose the tier of cars you and tracks you wanted to race but the multiplayer is resticted to Elimination mode only. The hard AI in the game is pretty challenging and could provide a couple more hours of fun.The game provides both online and local multiplayer up to 4 players, the only game mode for multiplayer is Elimination mode. It plays the same way like in the single player mode but instead of having 1v1 you are having a 4 player elimination race.I'll highly recommend this game if it goes on sale for around $10, the game length is really short. It took me 4 hours to finish the game with all stars and all achievement (the achievement are super easy though). For the full price Codemasters is asking for now, it is still pretty good if you are a fan of top down racer, likes the toy cars feel with bright colours and casual racing."

The shallowness of content compared to its predecessors will perhaps turn a lot of nostalgic fans wanting a new and improved MicroMachines game away.As a mobile game, the content ticks all the familiar boxes; races are short, are rated with three stars, collecting coins unlocks vehicles, etc. Its biggest problem, as I have previously mentioned, is that it is nothing spectacular and oftentimes feels as if the developers were playing it just a little too safe - In other words, everything Toybox Turbos does as a racing game of its kind has already been seen before with the previous MicroMachines iterations (and in some cases, was done somewhat better).I would reccomend this game, however, in the hopes that codemasters develops a proper sequel more in the spirit of MicroMachines V3.

On one hand it's easy to pick up and play, on the other... well, no, you can play this entire game on one hand. It's arrow keys + numpad0 (or WASD + space) for driving and using pickups, and apart from aggressive drafting, shortcuts and strategic dropping of mines there's not much else you can do. Perhaps that's why the events took me 103 minutes total to complete, including frequent restarts to get gold medals/beat my one friend on the leaderboard's scores. Most of it felt kind of inane, with the AI rarely giving much of a challenge outside of seemingly random selections of events, where the they-can-push-you-but-not-vice-versa physics got me stuck on obstacles or the random pickup system decided to take me uphill.+ Can play with one hand+ Quick events+ Decent music (though very repetitive)+ Handling is alright- Very short- Inconsistent AI- Pickups turn some events into a slot machine- You unlock boss vehicles that you can't use- Bad car/car collision physics (e.g. picked one of the heaviest vehicles and still couldn't push other cars at all)- Time trials are full of mines for no reason- No rebinding of anythingConsider the price of this, then the price of Motorstorm RC, a game that lasts much longer for less money."

Also the one that tought that filling the track with jumps that send you flying into curves was a good idea should be fired.The cars are nice, but they don't really play much different from each other.

While other games will try to make you feel in charge, Toybox Turbos makes it very clear that the developers are running the show.Other games try to give you an explanation why that camera is at that ungodly angle, or why THAT enemy has to have three times as much health. Not TT. The reason why the camera won't let you look ahead, is because the developers wanted to make it slightly frustrating. Ditto on the strange car physics... and let's not even speak about how the camera is always NOT right behind the car, leaving you slightly disoriented.Accept that this as the real challenge you've been given and TT will be a lot of fun. Or at least as much fun as you can have with 18 tracks. Yes, the game is very short. Four hours and you should have received every car, track and achievement that's available.What makes Toybox Turbos different from the hundreds of mobile games that try to imitate Micro Machines is that it does not ever apologize for its shortcomings. With a camera that limits how far you can see, you'd expect long straight streets with virtually no obstacles. You'd expect environments that never block your view. You'd maybe expect a mini-map. And you'd definitely expect the camera to tightly follow your car at predictable angles.TT will have none of that. Instead you're given confusing environments with sharp turns, narrow straights, hundreds of deathtraps, a lot of stuff that is only designed to get in your way or block your view and a camera that will make every tight turn an exercise in multitasking.And it works. It's a kind of challenge I haven't seen in years and it is oh so refreshing to encounter it once again. True, in the day of Micro Machines, the technology of the day required this kind of limitation, while it's just an artistic choice now, but it still feels good. And in a way, you feel like every match is a personal match against the designers."

No frustrating gamemodes?This is it.Instead of cheating AI, there's slipstreaming, just like GTA Online (driving in the trail of your opponent makes you go faster). Unlike GTA Online, once everyone is bunched up together, the race gets more fun, not less, so it's not an issue here but rather a very big plus. The powerups are all balanced and the receiver even has a chance to negate some of them (i.e. being set on fire actually speeds you up, so you can use it to gain a massive lead, however you also get very slippery controls and if you touch an obstacle, you die, so only do if you're not on fire). This is a game of skill, not luck, so no matter what powerup you get, you're not any worse off than the other guy.The cars are divided into groups depending on their speed, so you can't under any circumstance race against a superior car. At the same time, various cars in a group are all different in their handling and you're guaranteed to find your favorites. They went complete nuts with their designs so racing bulldozers, tanks or moon buggies is a normal occurence (they're all reasonably fast despite not looking the part).I've only played through the campaign alone, and I had a blast, in fact I find myself playing Elimination just for fun even now. I can only imagine how fun multiplayer would be, but alas, I've yet to catch an online game that doesn't lag so much it's unplayable, and my dear roommate thinks inviting him to play is an assault on his loyalty to Need for Speed.

Single player isn't terrible at all, and there are multiple different modes to make the game not monotonous. The game also does not overstay its welcome, with 100% completion taking me about ten hours, and that's with me being awful at racing games.I'm not actually sure if it's because I'm just bad at racing games either, but the game does provide some actual challenge with its various modes. The time trials are absolutely brutal, and I finished all of them within a second of the required time to get a perfect rating, so even to people who play the genre all the time, this might be interesting as a grab for them.There are so many little tiny details that were put into this game that I love. The cars have little screws on the bottom. There are a few cars that come with working sirens, and all of them have working horns which you can spam, if nothing else. The levels themselves are absolutely adorable, all clearly designed with the idea of your cars actually being toys in mind.This is really just a cute, very fun game that I would recommend to everyone who wants a new little racing game to try out, especially if you have some friends who would want to give it a go with you."

A tiny car. You race other tiny cars around tiny tracks made of household objects like dishes in the kitchen sink and books with witty titles. You collect tiny parcels that give you silly powerups such as an EMP device and, of course, the timeless mounted instakill mallet.And it's a racing game, so the objective is to get to the finish line first after 3 laps, right? Well, no. Not necessarily. The single-player campaign has various game modes: There's the (relatively) dullgo-round-3-times-win-congrats mode, the rather tenseOMG-flee-from-scary-blue-space-stuffmode, the satisfyingmake-traffic-explode-by-overtakingmode, and others.And then there'sTHEmode. The way it's meant to be played: The mode where the objective is to get your opponent off the screen by any devious means necessary - by strategically nudging them off the bridge of rulers, by tactically falling back before opening fire with a tiny tommy gun, or just by being boring and going fast.And on top of the solid mechanics, there are loads of lovely little details:Plenty of maps with creative designs and hidden shortcuts.The little joy of unlocking the collectable cars by taking them out of their packages.Local and online multiplayer.The 'classic' camera mode.A host of vehicles - hovercraft, bulldozers, black cabs, tanks - each with customisable colour schemes and their own horn effect.

,Not Recommended,287260,12989906,"Posted: 17 November, 2014",all,Det. Dicksmack²,"Toybox Turbos is a very easy game. Now, easy doesn't necessarily mean bad but I just can't see myself recommending this game to anyone except die hard fans of the Micro Machines V games. And even then... I was a huge fan of V3 when I was a kid. And this game does make you relive the nostalgia you had during those times but the game fails to really expand on anything or make itself stand out.The biggest disappointment by far is the tracks. Not only is there not many of them, but they're insanely short. A single track could take just 20 seconds to complete each lap for a grand total of minute long races. I can't recall if Micro Machines had longer tracks but, in this game, the tracks are just way too short. The visuals are nice but you'll get tired of seeing the same scenery over and over again especially when the design of them aren't exciting or challenging. Every track feels roughly the same and doesn't keep the races fresh. Shortcuts are rather weak and don't have any sort of creativity put behind them except for maybe one or two. Most of them just involve creating a small micro shortcut that let's you skip a hairpin turn.There's not much to really complain about the driving other than the really dumbed down physics. Colliding with other drivers doesn't cause much penalty to you or them so trying to play dirty doesn't work. That's left up to the weapons and they're honestly really boring when you stip them down to their basic principle. There's a hammer which destroys anything in front of you in one hit, a machine gun with autoaim that can kill you and mess up your handling, an emp ball that is supposed to short out the controls but is so minimal it's useless, a magnet that let's you instantly snap to any other driver, and rocket boosters. That's really it.The game's music is okay I guess. It's nothing too exciting there's really only about 3-5 music tracks to go around so get used to that. The music varies depending on the mode you're playing and... well there's only 5. You have your standard races (which only go to a max of 4 for some reason), time trials, race against the clock, overtaking and escape. Escape is by far the best mode but eventually you get to a point where the blue aura of death goes much faster than you and kills you automatically making fighting for the leaderboard rather impossible.Apart from that the game is just too easy. It has a spike in difficulty once you reach the 4th or 5th cup but for the first few cups you'll be whizzing right through every challenge with ease. Despite the spike in difficulty I still managed to beat the game and unlock every car within 3 hours.The multiplayer is decent enough. I've yet to play classic mode but they made the smart choice of taking the Elimination mode from the boss-battles and made it between 4 players which is nice. Players fight for points as one person either A. Has to leave the pack behind in the dust or B. Be the last one still alive. But it's hard to recommend because no one seems to own this game and the only one online battle I was able to find was on launch day.Overall Toybox Turbos does a fair job of being reminiscent of the old Micro Machines games but fails to capture the same charm and fun those games had. It just doesn't do anything new or exciting to make itself stand apart. Again, if you're a true Micro Machines V fan then I suggest checking out the demo, but even then I'd be wary of making a purchase.Toybox Turbos gets a 6/10."

And frankly, it really does nothing special that trys to make it different from those games. Maybe the Hot Wheels games were Micro Machines clones (I wouldn't be suprised), but that doesn't change the fact that this game feels nothing new.It's also really, really short. What, a little over three hours to finish 1st in almost everything, with a 50/50 chance of people being in mutliplayer three years in? Without a quick play button, that's the nail in the coffin. One of my favorite games (you'll have to get a CD),Blur, also doesn't have quick play, but it was long and had a great gameplay gimmick (storage of weapons). I couldn't tell you what this game's gimmick is. I can tell you it'sgearedfor little ones, though.The sad thing is, it's a very well polished game.

Comparing the two and focusing on Toybox Turbos I could say this game is a little more cartoonish and has an even more ridiculous setting than its counterpart. From a kitchen to a classroom and a play room, the environments are always creative and the cutness factor is high. Some of the situations are so ridiculous (ex.: the toaster jump) that you'll just laugh out loud at what you're seeing.This game is the second title I see based on a genre that I would've initially though VR would be useless for... and I've now been proven wrong twice in a row.

,Not Recommended,287260,13135127,"Posted: 28 November, 2014",all,Jet Uppercut,"Toybox Turbos gets a lot of the fundamentals of the original Micro Machines games down quite well.The tracks are fun and populated with an all manner of daily items and some not so daily ones.You race with a variety of fun little cars, ranging from Double Decker Buses to Monster Trucks and Tanks.The race modes are entertaining and the Boss Battles at the end of a chapter are a nice change of pace.Unfortunately, the game has very little content. About halfway through the game you stop seeing new tracks and are just playing through the same variety of modes across the same tracks, just you go a little faster. It took me about an hour and twenty minutes to get 3-stars on all of the tracks, beat all of the bosses and grind up the rest of the coins to buy the remaining 2 cars at the end of the game.For someone who hasn't played a racing game before, it might be quite challenging. I'm sure the game is targeted towards children who don't even know what a Micro Machine is.But for me, who does know what a Micro Machine is, I felt it was missing quite a lot. There were no wacky cast of characters to choose from as your racer, the AI all did the same thing every race, including driving up against walls and flying off the track in Head to Head mode and there's only one track in the entire game where you get to drive in the pockets of the pool table and you only get to race on it once.For a remake of the classic Micro Machines games it presents to you the absolute minimum. Small cars driving on familiarly themed but equally tiny tracks.For $10, it's a fun little nostalgia trip with a few funny references tossed into the event names, a charming aesthetic and some great miniature cars you can paint up how you like. But the overall game itself is very lacking and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except children and fans of the older games."

It is Micro Machines in all but name, but still manages to capture the look and feel of those classics.Racing takes place on courses in various rooms of the house just as an imaginative young mind might create. Most of the courses are fun and feature lots of big jumps and tight corners and are set in some imaginative locations such as a dinosaur park, a kids party and dad's snooker table. Most of them have hazards such as train tracks to jump over, oil slicks to slip on and even a volcano spitting out lava onto the track. There are also a great selection of vehicles which include the usual sports cars and hatchbacks as well as diggers, earth movers, police cars and tanks.As you race around you can collect power ups which you can then use to blast the living daylights out of any other racers who happen to stand between you and an ill deserved first place. Remember that they can give as good as they get and will shoot back. Races are quite short at only 3 laps and over within a flash.In the single player game each championship is based around a certain type of vehicle such as emergency or construction vehicles. These include the normal finish first races, time trials and overtake challenges. Each one ends with a one on one boss race where you have to outrun or blast your opponent to win. Do this a set number of times and you win their car and unlock the next championship. The game also features a good multi player mode with all of these types of races and more.Unfortunately the game is quite short – you will finish the single player game in a couple of hours and even the multi player doesn't really give you that much more to do. It has a sort of ""seen it done it"" feel to it which becomes a little monotonous after a while. Having said that the game is fun while it lasts.It does have a fairly low price tag and Micro Machines fans will probably get more out of it, but the short play time hurts it a lot – if you really want it get it on sale..."

Toybox Turbos is great! - but WHY did codemasters make such an awful multiplayer?Codemasters has made some amazing race titles over the years (see the DIRT & GRID series of games), and brought their great engine and art design to a new frontier in the micro-machines inspired Toybox Turbos.  The preview video looks amazing, the gameplay is cartoony fun, and I can even forgive the kid-friendly difficulty level, but there are some glaring problems here. There are little things like 4:3 overlays that look strange on 16:9 monitors and a bizzare playoff mode - but the most horrible thing is the state of the multiplayer and overall jankyness of the online modes. The only option for competition is this game mode where you race for 8-10 seconds and respawn over and over. It is so mind-numbing it makes me sad. The inclusion of a normal race mode would have made all the difference in the world. WTF Codemasters!I actually purchased the 4-pack since I was so excited to play with my friends, but at this point I want my money back. 6 / 10 for a game that I want to like so much.

Its annoying and it stupidly pans out so that both cars are showing on the screen. So the player car cannot see whats in front of him. Also the views are not very good as well. Instead of the 3d side view I would have liked  a view right behind the car. I just think they could have done better with the camera and offered more viewpoints. You have 3 or 4 views and 1 of them is useless. The top down view is useless as you cannot see the track to navigate. Also the cars do get quicker  and rather then help the game I feel like it hurts the game even more because of the terrible viewpoints the game sticks you with. A better game would be Little Racers STREET that has more cars and a much more interesting tracks and even includes weather effects. It also has a ton of camera angles including a bumper camera behind the car.Also the tracks are super small. So when your racing your car around the track races are over very quickly and this gives me the impression of an android game.  I did try the demo and enjoyed it because it was easy to win races. Later in the game it gets much tougher and its a lot more annoying. So more speed plus a crummy camera angle=a turn off for me.

They do longer own the title name which is a big shame but, this didn't stop them from making this spiritual sucessor of Micro Machines...V4...I think. Either way, onto teh poit. Die-hard fans or any one getting into the racing genre, should get his? Absolutely, especially with a 75% off discount on it! It's hardly updated these days but doesn't mean the game is mega dead. People, somehow still play it and I got the achievement I needed to make sure I 100% clear this game.You are given one car only, you can unlock the rest by yourself by grabbing these shiny coins around the tracks, and trust me, you'll eb grabbing a lot, once I tell you this. People said this game is easy, it's not as easy as you think. Ofcourse, the first world is mega easy, each world contains a set of different events, not just races but challenges, and these has leaderboards, which is fun. After all event are clear or at a certain given amount of stars is reach, the boss can now be dueled. Win against him, and the vehicle's yours. Basically, a pink slip.After World 2, things start getting harder, and harder like, it makes you avoid the coins you need to buy the cars you want. So that's already something good aboutt he game - it might be short, but it's all pretty challenging if you're not excellent in racing games - I do okay and I still manage to fail here and there sometimes.Now for multiplayer - sad part of it, has one mode only, which is just like The MM games = stay offscreen behind, your out and you lose points, depending of your position. Be the only one in teh screen and you'll get teh maximum points of the round, and along with weapons and madness, while can be repetitive after a while, it's a blast. I haven't tried locally because I don't have that many friends with me at this moment but online proved actually fun.If you have some real life friends to play with, get this and gift them this too, unless they have it too. It's major fun for the whole family. The graphics and visuals are cartoony and gets that Micro Machines appeal.I'll give it a solid 8 out of 10, get it on full price if you want Codies to deserve the money or get it discounted for 75%off, this game is at the very bargainy price, perhaps right too."

,Recommended,287260,14050683,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,TuftyIndigo,"You won't see ""Micro Machines"" mentioned anywhere in this game, but if you played the MM games in the 90's and miss them, you will love Toybox Turbos. Codemasters have done a really good job in replicating the feel of the original. Replacing the old tile-based maps with 3D ones really adds to the feel of just racing cars around whatever was lying about on the table. It's full of nice details too. Some of the spoof books and fake brand names on the track are quite witty, and when you score a point, the car bounces and spins just like in MM. The single player is longer than it looks. There's the usual kind of unlock-driven progression that you expect from modern racing games, but that is very much downplayed: you unlock by driving through coins in-race, so you can't ever run out; unlocks are cheap, so there's no ""grinding"".But if you're buying this game it won't be for the single-player alone. Multiplayer is where it's at. Because there's no real in-game communication, playing against randoms is not that fun, but great Steam integration makes it easy to play with up to three friends, whether they're near (at the same computer) or far (playing on their own computers). Multiplayer can be a bit unfair occasionally: sometimes the physics is a little implausible, and the wrong player gets taken out or one player survives a crash they really shouldn't be able to, but TBH Micro Machines had just the same problem, and this element of randomness actually helps stop the gameplay feeling overly competitive.An update added Oculus Rift support. I wouldn't say the Rift is ideally suited to what is at heart a social game, but it's a neat addition. You feel like you can reach out and pick up the little cars. The scale feels a bit off, and the loading screens are really disorienting, but apart from that it's a good integration and an unexpected bonus.The only shortcoming really is that the only controller supported is the XBox 360. I hoped I could use it with some no-name controllers, but I was disappointed. It only really needs a stick or D-pad and a couple of buttons for accelerate and brake (and you won't be pressing brake often), so it's hard to see why they couldn't have added support for arbitrary controllers. You can still use the keyboard, so even if you've only got one 360 controller, you can just fight over who gets it. Other additions I'd like to see are helicopters (remember the helicopters in Micro Machines? they were really hard), and even a map designer, but the game is complete as it is.I've already had lots of fun with this game: having a quick race on my own, with friends when they come to visit, or at a LAN party (bearing in mind the four-player limit). I don't know anyone who hasn't enjoyed playing it, and if you remember saving up your pocket money for one of the old Micro Machines games, you certainly won't regret spending a few quid on this spritual successor."

It's a nice try but the make so many mistakes:- It automaticaly resets the view on loading screens. Every time you make yourself a comfortable distance (because the panels are far to close) it resets itself on the next loading screen.- The controls should be directional. That whould make it far nicer to control.- When a race is finished they move faster across the track in a finishing anmation. This is way to fast. I always get sick.- Also when the race ist finished and on loading screens a screen gets fixed in your view. Never do that in VR!!! It's so annoying like someone holding a paper in your face.- It dosn't support the actual oculus drivers. They didn't manage to update this for 6 months now.I downgraded my drivers but it's still super complicated to get the game running.

It has the excellent table top racing you will know and love if you have played any of the Micro Machines games. They have slightly changed the camera so that it follows the car, this makes it a lot easier for people not familiar with the top town view but you can turn on the old school camera if you prefer. There is a good variety of vehicles, both old favourites and new ones. The disappointing part however was the number of tracks and the length of the single player campaign. It feels like there are significantly fewer tracks and more limited locations compared to V4. So overall it is an enjoyable game but nostalgia for the Micro Machines games made me expected it to be better."

There are all the core elements of the series: toy cars, crazy tracks, speed and the duel mode, where you  must race faster than your rival in order to get him out of the screen and score a point.There's a fun single player career mode, where you have to select different types of cars, choosing from bulldozers, sportcars, trucks, etc with different characteristics and driving styles. The sense of progression is good, you have to earn in-game coins (fortunately, there aren't microtransactions) to unlock new rides and for every championship you have a boss to defeat in duel. Even if the AI is simplicistic and the general difficulty is low, this title engages you with all the different playmodes that has to offer: from Time Attack to standard race with weapons it's a fun to play especially with friends, whenever it's local or online multiplayer.Techincally speaking, the game offers nice visuals, consider it like a more polished mobile game. Even the controls are responsive and you can feel the difference when driving all the 35 cars.If you like arcade-style car games you should take in consideration this title. For a small price (on sale) you can bring at home some serious fun. If you have friends (locally or online) this game can be really addictive, because the singleplayer it isn't so long.
