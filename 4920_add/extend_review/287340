CMR 2 was/is an AMAZING game, a benchmark for rally games at its time that has aged exceptionally well. How hard could it possibly be? Take that game, port it to a modern engine, maybe nix a car or two and replace decals if you can't get hold of the same licensing deals, and you've got a great game, done!But no...This game manages to be so basic, so stripped down, that it barely even qualifies as a racing game, let alone something that should be mentioned in the same breath as CMR 2.Cars: CMR 2 had over 20 different cars. This game has 4. Yes, four.Courses: CMR 2 had 8 countries/courses. This game has 3. Yes, three... To make things worse, the Australia and Greece courses are basically the same gravel track. The Corsica Course is 100% tarmac. That's it. All races are in daylight, no rain. Compare that to CMR 2, where you had rain stages, night stages, snow courses, mud courses, hardpack and loose gravel courses, etc...Controls/physics: Pretty much any jump will send you into a barrel roll. There's a glitch that appears pretty often where while climbing, the car will suddenly ""snag"" onto the track like it's a piece of fabric, and lose all momentum. Wonder how many hours has been put into playtesting...More problems:- The cockpit view. MY GOD. You'll have to see this one for yourself... I'm dead serious, the Sega Daytona USA arcade machines had more detailed cockpit graphics! CMR 2 for PC came out in 2000 and it had a fully detailed cockpit for each car, what the hell happened here?- If you look at actual PC (not console) screenshots of CMR 2, this game does not look better in any regard, it actually looks worse... much worse. Much worse than a game from 2000...- Absolutely no pre-race tuning, which was a major part of CMR 2 and was pretty much obligatory to get good times at courses. But I guess it wouldn't be neccessary in a game like this anyway, where the courses are as varied as peas in a can.- At this point mentioning the lack of replays, additional game modes etc is pointless. This game would still be a steaming turd, with or without more content.Multiplayer: nope.Controller support: if you have anything more exotic than a 360 pad, you're out of luck as there are no remapping options.Please, DON'T repeat my mistake and buy this."

Why they couldn't just release the original is beyond me.The old menu is gone, instead you have the standard iphone menus, which are all the same. There is no way to choose your tires, or set suspension firmness or any of that, you wouldn't want to waste time on that would you?!, you want to click, and click and play! Because you're a dumbass who plays on iphones. Repairing your car is also a farce. And on top, to add the final touch, they've decided to throw out loads of stages. Why not?! Who wants to rally in the UK, or Sweden, or New Zealand anway? You also have less cars to choose from, just in case too many cars confuses you.It's still more rally than Dirt 2, 3 and Showdown though."

Well, I have to recognize that has been achieved. You can play it... at least the parts you can...Megabazillion tracks... errr nope: The original game brings us 9 countries, (Kenia, Finland, UK, Sweden, Australia, Japan, Corsica, Greece and Italy) each with twelve stages. This rip only brings Australia, Corsica and Italy. By now, The game duration's been cut to a third.Megabazillion rally cars... errr neither: The original game places us behind the wheel of 24 rally cars, counting WRC, B group and various paint schemes. Here there are ONLY FOUR STINKY CARS. Content reduced to a fifth.Then, the controls. I'll agree Colin McRae wasn't the most realistic rally game in history (we have RBR for that), but at least you can figure out what is driving a WRC. Here, the controls are almost random. The car cuts gas in the middle of a straight without any reason at all, and the turns are divided into two: you did it or you didn't (There's no way to negotiate a drift)... Basically, I found out that I can't drive the car as I want (as in the original), but instead I have to learn how the game wants me to drive it.And then, the graphics... well, even worse than the original (the internal view is worth a shot, don't miss it), plus the scenary has been cut to a size that looks more like you're playing Gran Turismo 1.In a nutshell, don't set your hopes any high: It's an awful port, ripped everywhere, and almost unplayable.(Traducción al español)Como desgraciar un buen juego:Teniendo el Colin McRae Rally 2.0 original de la época, lo que esperaba era poder jugarlo completo en el PC que tengo ahora sin tener que andar haciendo experimentos. Bueno, hay que reconocer que eso si se ha logrado, Jugarse, se puede jugar. Lo que se puede jugar...Pistas a go-go... pues nó: El juego original nos permitía correr por Kenia, Finlandia, UK, Suecia, Australia, Japón, Corcega, Grecia e italia. Este rip no trae mas que Australia, Corcega y Grecia. De momento, la duración del juego se ha reducido una tercera parte.Coches de rally a go-go... pues tampoco: El juego original nos pone a los mandos de 24 coches, entre WRC, Grupo B y esquemas de pintura variados. Aquí no hay mas que CUATRO APESTOSOS COCHES. El contenido se reduce a una quinta parte.Luego ya está la cosa de los controles. De acuerdo que Colin McRae no era el juego de rallies mas realista de la historia (para eso está el RBR), pero por lo menos te podías hacer una idea. Aquí los controles son prácticamente aleatorios. El coche deja de acelerar de forma incomprensible en medio de una recta, los giros son una de dos: o entras o no entras (no hay posibilidad de negociar un derrape)... En resumen: me he encontrado con que, en lugar de conducir como yo quiero, tengo que aprender a conducir como el juego quiere.Y los gráficos... pues muy justitos. Comparados con el original son incluso peores (la vista interna del coche es digna de ver), y encima han restado profundidad al escenario de una manera que parece que estés jugando en gran turismo 1.En resumidas cuentas, no te hagas ilusiones: Es un port horroroso, recortado por todas partes, y prácticamente injugable."

Harsh terrain, realistic and believable damage to your car as you make stupid mistakes, and a fairly competitive AI that makes it a nice challenge all-in-all.That isn't this game. This game is a mobile port. It isn't (at all) what it tries to advertise itself as. Handling is simplified, damage is merely cosmetic at best, the terrain looks horrible. Remastered is a term many low-resolution games use these days to try and bring these experiences to the modern PC, but Colin McRae Rally doesn't manage to do any of it.It lacks features that previous games in the series. You can't customize your car's behavior before a stage. Repairs are fairly unneeded as they don't impact gameplay, and fixing the ""engine"" costs the same amount of time as fixing the ""suspension"" or ""wheels"".There isn't much else to say. This game was trading on good memories of the Colin McRae series and it's just a cash grab. It's lame, it doesn't feel like a rally game, and overall it's a perfect example of what is happening to Steam's storefront where publishers and developers have no shame about what they try to do with their advertising."

For the most part the tracks are all pretty simple and not very fun. IF you saw the trailer, they pretty much showcased all the cool or fun corners, the other 97% is just long boring straights that veer to the left or right. Driving in its self was pretty uneventfull and unfulfilling. Mariokart 64 was better driving game then this. Only a handfull of cars, very barren environments with the occasional weird stick tree or shrub. It was pretty boring to play. Save your money and buy DiRT on the next steam sale."

But where are all the tracks? Sweden, Finland etc..? Just single player without split-screen, that's huge disappointment and takes half of the fun away! Now we got achievements, three maps and four cars. No real championship, just tournaments. That is a ripoff, and shame to original series.

This is not that game.What we have instead is a stripped-down version with less cars, fewer stages and fewer set-up/repair options which was previously released for mobile devices. Between purchase and writing this review the store description has been updated to reflect this, but it still leaves a faint glimmer of hope that this might be something better. Don't be under any illusions  - you're paying to play the mobile version with better controls on a bigger screen.In fairness to Codemasters, this is at least a competent driving game. The cars handle at least as well as in the original, with noticeable changes between surfaces. Car damage does affect performance, but the scaled-back repair interface takes away most of the decisions in choosing what to fix between stages. There are only four cars available to drive (three of which must be unlocked by completing events), but they recreated as well as possible in the engine.Ultimately though, I can't recommend this. It may only be £4.99, but that still feels expensive for a cut-down version of a ten-year-old game. You would be better-off spending your money on a copy of the original on ebay and taking the time to get it working"

I start the career mode, struggling to figure out how to increase the difficulty, no you can't the ""championship"" is split up into several championships, where the AI starts off super easy in the first and then gets progressively harder towards the last championships. To add even more insult the first three championships are just based on their respective countries, i.e. Australia is the first championship and Greece is the second. Then they will ""Mix"" it up a bit and add a championship with all three countries stating ""it’s time to test your skill on more difficult changing terrains!"" no all they did was make the AI slightly more difficult to beat. Where the AI is concerned it is clear that for each championship they just have a set time to beat which obviously gets harder as you move onto the next championship. Secondly they start the race at 40MPH (so during the later championships you are just playing catch-up) and clearly do not suffer from car damage and hairpin turns, because from start to finish their progress bar moves at the same speed. Next is the damage system! I crash into a tree full on and my car is fully repaired for the next set of races, I cut a few corners and I have no time to repair my car properly resulting into the next two races being a challenge to stop the car from blowing up. Last the sound is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I constantly hear screeching as if I’m sliding on tarmac even if I am playing on a DIRT road, when wearing a headset it will give you a right bloody headache. Codemasters, can you just tell us what the AI target time is on the last championship? If I know then I won’t need to keep on this repetitive ride of going through the same championship over and over and over again, I can just do a time trial. It’s a good thing that this was marketed as ""based on"" and not a remake, otherwise I would of had a refund, the only way this would be worth the money is if Codemasters threw in the original CMR 2.0 and give us the rest of the game!

It's clear the game has seen little to no effort put into it by Codemasters, and there are just too many games better than this to waste your time with it. Even once I'd adjusted the setup of controls to make it more playable, I found I just coudn't be bothered. It's uninspiring and dull, and the menus are about as slick as a car stuck in mud.Play one of the Dirt series or even Xpand Rally before this. Don't give Codemasters the idea that their ports of mobile titles are acceptable.New score: 3, and game deleted, even if it doesn't take up much space.[original review]I've gone for a tentative Yes here, despite me kind of only half liking it. If you buy it and try it, you're getting a useful insight into mobile gaming ported to PC. You're also getting one of a few sparse rally games available for PC these days, and for that, it does hold some value. Just make sure you buy it cheap!I had already bought this on Android and it didn't last long before I deleted it. In hindsight I do wonder if I'd merely missed a config screen allowing you to adjust sensitivity, and in the case of PC, dead zone too.  For my first couple of goes on PC, it was horrible with a 50% deadzone meter and maximum sensitivity. The car would barely turn for most of the stick's travel, then suddeny lurch, makign it twitchy an unresponsive at the same time. Wholly unpleasant. However, step the deadzone down to a few notches off minimum, and reduce the sensitivity to about 35% and it's a different animal; it feels to control much better.There are still issues mind... such as the controller being useless in some menu screens so that you can't actually select the Proceed button; or when up becomes down and vice versa.Once or twice too when driving what appeared to be a rock and incident free stretch of track, the car would flip like it'd hit a big rock, causing confusion and delay as you roll the car and often end up facing the wrong way.If I was to rate this game out of 10, I'd go for a 6.

Graphics might have been decent in early 2000s. Sadly it came out in 2014, meaning that it is not somewhat acceptable nor decent.This is NOT a remake of original Colin McRae Rally, no matter what the game's store page implies. Instead it is a mobile game by the same name ported to PC. It looks like a mobile game, it sounds like a mobile game, it definitely feels like a mobile game, and it has the complexity and realism of a mobile game. So it is a mobile  game. And not a very good one either.I especially ""like"" how the game engine has trouble handling jumps. Weird things often happen when your car becomes airborne. Like your car attempting to do an aileron roll for no apparent reason, or being stopped by an invisible obstacle when landing. Though I would say that the game engine has trouble not just with jumps, but with pretty much everything related to driving. Controls are unresponsive and most of the time playing feels like you are driving a brick around. A somewhat weirdly behaving brick.And I absolutely ""love"" the fact that most of the objects you see on the road are completely static, which means that either they are sprites and you go through them without any physical reaction from either the car or the object, or they seem to weigh couple of metric tons regardless of size or material, stopping the car instantly. That is so 1990s. I guess you could call that retro.Also the amount of content is minimal with just few different rallies, and there is no replay value at all. Really.Very much NOT recommended."

It also only has 4 drivable cars, the Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and the Lanica Stratos. Whether more tracks and cars will become available later down the line, I don’t know.The menu design is rather clunky and is clearly designed for a touch screen device and there is no tuning section for your car and no replays after each race. There is however a section for repairing your car after 2 rally stages although as far as I can see the damage on your car does little to how you perform during a race.As for the racing the controls are okay, the graphics are also okay however some of the textures such as the walls can look very ugly, alot of the sprites also look fairly blend eg. Crowd members and trees. To get round this there is quite a bit of motion blur which does make the game look smoother at times.The pyhsics of the game are also okay but not great. There is some visual damage to your car when you hit objects, but this could be improved massively. There are also inconsistences in the track I found myself getting caught on flat bits of land and getting flung up into the air with no real reason.Finally the speed, when I first started the game I thought I hadn't set my car up correct because it seemed so slow. In many rally cars you find yourself in constant battle to keep the car under control, however here you can hold down the gas/acceleration button for the majority of the time without having many issues.So my thoughts this game is okay at best, but it could of been more, should of been more. It should have brought back the old school Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 memories. But this game simply doesn't live up to that title and that’s a shame."

There's some other rally games, but they're never good.So, the price should have been a little warning, but for a (very good) PS1 game HD remake i thought it wasn't so much. So i bought it, launch it and first ""shock"", the soundtrack in the menu, not the one i know, whatever, i'm not here for that, i want to play, less menu, no car settings, ok, ok, if they keep the essence of CMR i'm ready to lose a few things...I start to drive, gearbox in manual, like the good old times, and few minutes after i thought, maybe it's me, or the Xbox one controller, i haven't the same feeling than before. I continue to drive, in order to be sure, and finally the conclusion arrive. The cars seems to never manage to accelerate properly, i never goes further than the fourth gear and 120km/h, in fact you can but only in straight lines, the handbrake isn't very present, the physics of the games seems clearly far of CMR2.0, i was able to take corners sideways on the old game and the cars really gives the impression that you were doing it (the camera was helping too), here you can slide but, it seems to be difficult fot the car to slide when in place, when you turn, the cars slow down too much, you can't really make it slide very long.So if you consider buying this game while thinking to CMR2.0, forget it, clearly codemaster shouldn't have evoke CMR2.0 in the description, that's miles away (in the wrong direction) of it.

But unfortunately, it is the only positive aspect.Then you realize you have only 3 countries (6 rallies with 6 stages each, but some stages repeat and some others are just reversed) and 4 cars. Boredom and monotony hit you just after some hours in game, especially that if you want to unlock all these cars and stages, you have to play infinite number of those boring and repeatable rally championships in career mode. Trust me, you will miss Sweden or Safari Rally and old good Peugeot 206.And then, when you unlock some better cars, like Lancia, you will see that the physics makes it totally undrive-able and every corner or crest result in a big roll or barrell. Every f*****g corner on higher speed ends that way and every f*****g ""jump"" ends in a seroius roll and you are where you don't want to be, most likely between trees and rear facing with totalled car. Just see some videos or gifs on game community site. I think that testers never completed all the stages to the end before release. Or maybe they did only in Focus, because in that car this phenomena wasn't so frequent and annoying.I bought that game on sale and have no regrets considering money, 1,49 euro for some retro fun is a good price, although I feel that time spent in game to complete the career and get all achievements is wasted."

They're also invincible and suffer no damage/speed penalties at all.- Unity -> damn, a rich dev/publisher like Codemasters can't afford a better engine? Why didn't they use any from their older CMR's or Dirt games? Oh right, that would mean they'd need to do something more than just recompiling the ARM mobile version to x86.- a lot more, but the game just isn't worth enough for writing it downIf you want the real CMR experience, get anything from 1 to 2005 or any Dirt and stay away from this; if you still want it because of the price - forget it and get Xpand Rally.

I'm using quotation marks since, astonishingly, the game is actually not based on the original CMR, but Colin McRae Rally 2.0 instead. But it's not a conversion of CMR2 either, it's only using some of the cars and some of the assets of the original. The garage options have been stripped down, the number of cars have been cut and difficulty level generally made easier.For some bizarre reason the championship requires you to complete two consecutive six-leg rallies in one location before moving to the next, which I don't remember being a feature in the original. Didn't see any nighttime special stages either, and the damage model feels more forgiving.The end result is a game that kinda feels like the CMR games of yesteryear, but then again kinda doesn't and will just aggravate you more based on how well you remember the first few Colin games. They should've just straight up ported CMR1 and be done with it. This game, while serviceable, definitely will not satisfy the fans of the originals."

Looks like CMR2.0 with modern processing effects applied.- Quite an accurate car models of real vehicles- Decent physical model with unique behaviour for each vehicle- Each car seems to have it's own specific durability level of each system and tends to receive specific damage depending on your driving styleIn comparions with CMR2.0 some content is removed:- less cars avaliable- no tuning- simplified repairs- less rallies (no Finland, Sweden, Kenya and England)- no duel stages at the end of each rally- no weather and night stages- rallies are shorter (6 stages per rally max)- less camera modes- no arcade mode- much less unlockable contentI used to be very found of CMR series and especially of 2.0, but still I can make some mistakes in my comparison cause it was long ago when I used to play it.Summary:Don't take it as one of CMR istallments, but consider it to be separate game of more arcade style.Would siut casual players, those who llooks for CMR2.0 nostalgie sessions, people infamiliar with CMR series and looking for arcade with real vehicles with more or less realistic behavior.Will fail to meet your expectations if you are looking for something in line with established CMR experience.Anyway I'd still recommend this game as a good fun."

And the direction arrows that show on screen sometimes obsruct your driving.3) Cars handle like rubbish. If you slow down too much, you lose all momentum, and if you try to keep your speed up, you'll likely still lose a lot of momentum, or slide as though you are riding a road bike going around corners on gravel - sliding uncontrollably off the road. Someone else said ""a brick with butter for wheels"". I'd agree.4) Graphics are forgettable. Car sounds, especially when moderately damaged, are rather annoying. All feels like a mobile port, and not a properly developed PC game.5) Probably forgotten something...If you like rally games, get any of the DiRT games. If you're not a fan of rally but wanted a casual arcadey game, don't buy this - I'm sure you can find a better game to spend a few bucks on."

Every two stages you get the chance to spent your time to repair broken parts of your car and race for the title.I'd recommend it to anyone who likes an Arcade racer or is a fan of rally.

There are much better racing games you can get at this price (or even lower)  (such as Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed, Blur, Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2010, Need for Speed the Run, and the Dirt series.LONGER VERSION:The entire game is pretty much time trials by yourself. Unfortunately you don't see your oponnents' cars. Each stage offers a different layout, but to advance to a different area, you have to play stages in the same area like 10 times. I got bored looking at the same environment and playing alone without AI cars.Controls feel just like the cars in the DiRT series, which is good. Your car becomes damaged if you bump into debris and trees. After like 2 races, you're given an option to make a limited number of repairs. With the limited ""repair time"" you must strategically choose which parts of the car you want to repair.Because of the slow progression through the game (it takes forever to see the different environments), and innability to see opponent cars or race alongside opponents, I cannot recommend this game at this price point.There are far better and fully fleshed-out games that can be purchased for about $5 which are much more fun."

Otherwise, don't buy it and you might as well stop reading here.As a whole game, it barely stands up with a few glitches in places, and some very repetitive rally stages (I've only found there to be 3 different countries so far). But the experience from this game is more of a reason to buy it.Essentially it feels like the rally games from 10 years ago (partly because it is) but the touch-ups in the remake allow it to feel and look how it does in your memory. This game does what it sets out to perfectly, it lets you relive the old games, without too many of the hassles involved in installing and setting up to work with controllers.As for the actual gameplay, the difficulty level is fairly easy and all the competitors times are pre-determined. The stage progress bar up the top (straight from the old rally games) bears no reference to whats happening on the track for your competitors, and only shows average speed of the lead CPU (Colin Mcrae in every race).When driving, you get the familar pace notes, although they are mostly accurate, relying on them too heavily will cause an accident. Things like sudden hairpins, jumps immediately before corners, and the pace notes only being 30-70m ahead of you make for some very reaction oriented driving (especially in Australia...).Damage is taken fairly easily in the cars, with even crash free stages short causing quite severe damage by the time you get in for repairs, making the 30 minutes for repairs quite strategic. When you crash (you will), the damage to power and suspension is the most noticeable, followed by the wheels, making you have to dynamically change driving styles mid-race (momentum is key with a ruined engine.)If you're expecting a fully fledged game, that will give you an engaging storyline, or even a new experience, don't buy this game. If you're after a relaxed drive down memory lane, and this game is on sale, I highly recommend it.Pros -Takes you back to the rally games of ten years ago.Works flawlessly with Xbox 360 Controller.More emphasis on better driving, rather than speed.Damage and repairs is a nice change.Cons -Invisible walls just of the edge of the track in some places.Pace notes not always accurate or timely.I crashed in the middle of the road, into the road at one point.Rolling the car doesn't result in immediate car reset.Not much variety in rally stages."

Based on he graphics alone you would be really hard pressed to say this game was originally released almost 20 years ago.I have played all the Colin McRae series, have mostly gived up on them since they became Dirt, but this edition does justice to the franchise. It is simply beautiful, drives very good and has enough features to be fun. Obviously the gameplay and interface is basic and it does behave like a very old game, but if you like the feel of older games and want to replay it on a much newer system it's worth a try.

You just pick a car and drive.

The handling characteristics are super simple and dumbed down. Hardly any need to use the brakes or accelerator with any modicum of finesse. Just barrel into a corner and, voila!, the car drifts itself.I would reccomend this game to someone who wants to have an arcade-style and very simple rally racing experience.

It certainly feels similar to playing the old game, and I feel like I recognise the tracks from my days spent on CM1 and 2.0. I would hesitantly recommend this as I have enjoyed my first few runs on it. However, there are a few issues. I have struggled to get my controller to behave as I would like. I can select keys or buttons but cannot change the analogue stick. Consequently I have to push left to accelerate and right to brake. I had a few hairpins where I ""whacked on the brake"" and actually accelerated into a crash. Also crests appear to cause my car to roll over several times. The next issue is the ""difficulty"". While getting used to the controller I decided to do the first Championship consisting of six tracks. Despite my crashes and rolls I won with a total of just under 19 minutes with the second place getting just under 26 minutes. I really ought to have to at least get good before winning, and never by that much!However, I enjoyed playing and it felt nostalgic. I certainly like the idea of some old classics being ""remastered"" for modern computers, and at a good price too. I look forward to a remastered Cannon Fodder... (hint hint)"

I started off in automatic transmission, where it would randomly stick in a gear i didn't want to be in. Switched to manual hoping that would solve the issue, but if anything it got worse. Wouldn't change up or down when needed, such as tricky hairpin bends. Not something you want from a rally game.Otherwise though, sublime in every other way.

I liked the possibility to destroy my car but missed damage indicator during stages.Rather than this game, I would like to see the first one remastered. I mean Colin McRae Rally (1998). Afterall it was worth its price 3€."

I'll be the first to say that its not Dirt3 ..not even close  but I think in a way thats the point really.  Granted its a port of the mobile version from 2013 , and the game doesnt boast ground breaking graphics, but for me being a fan of  the classic playstation titles of old find an odd charm about the game. It reminds of the old games in many ways. I look at this game as a different take on a classic title , its fun enough to play when killing time and graphically looks fine ( not mind blowing). If you want Dirt3 play Dirt3 or want a sim play one of the many offerings by Sim Bin. I added this game to my collection because I am a longtime fan of all things rally. But then again this is just my opinion."

By the time it was on sale it was apparent that this was in fact a PC port of the mobile game based upon Colin McRae Rally 2.0 and it had loads of negative reviews. In the end I still bought it because even if it is a cut down version I still wanted to play it to relive the fond memories of the original game.My first thought when I started the game was isn't this supposed to have updated graphics? After a look at screen shots of the original I could see the graphics have been updated but it still doesn't look great. I realised at this point that this game does not just need to measure up to the original but to the idealised version in my head coloured by years of nostalgia.To be fair it did have some aspects that lived up to my expectations. The overall driving mechanics are excellent fun (apart from the occasional collision detection glitch that just stops your car). It also has the great damage management aspects of the original what has been lacking from many of more recent dirt games.I am however still going to give this a thumbs down because they have cut so much out in comparison to the original it is not worth it. Most of the cars are gone, most of the tracks are gone, there are no different liveries, no different weather conditions, the car set up is gone and the detailed in car view is gone."

It's a remaster of Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (still don't understand why is it called just Colin McRae Rally instead of Colin McRae Rally 2.0 Remastered), but it lacks more than half of the content from the original game. You get to choose from only 4 cars (Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer and Lancia Stratos), 3 of them you have to unlock. There's only 3 countries (Australia, Greece and Corsica, originaly called France), so you get to race only on three types of surfaces - sand, tarmac and gravel. No mud, no snow, no ice. All the races happen during sunny day, which is the only weather condition in the entire game. No night, no rain, no storm, no snowing, no clouds etc. The game is an arcade just like the original, but the driving model is kinda weird. Almost any bigger jump is almost impossible to land in a higher speed, instead you always crash and roll, because the car behaves like if it was made out of rubber. Besides all that the game is also missing the Arcade mode, there's no multiplayer at all, you can't setup the car and you can repair only four things. The game is a port of a mobile version, so the menus look really simple and as for the graphics (since this is a remaster) it's basically just a resolution upscale with few added effects. And yes, I spent 9.6 hrs on this game, because that's approximately how much it will take you to finish all championships, after that there's no reason to play the game any more."

If you are not familiar with this, this game is a mobile port of Colin McRae Rally to PC and it is not worth the money.For a PC port, the driving dynamics are flawed compared to the original CMR 2.0. You have horrendous understeer every time you want to attack a corner unless you use the handbrake but really it drops the car's momentum and you have to face the unbearable by watching your car slowly climb back up to top speed.The physics are also bad because the suspension model makes the car absorb the shock and pre load your car into the air sending it crashing.Though I know this is a port and I love Codemasters very much, they should have kept this title only exclusive for mobile phones."

A very poor effort for what was advertised as a remaster of the original Colin McRae Rally games.Ok, I kind of get the fact that they would have been developing DiRT Rally at the time of this games release, but then again, why couldn't they have just done a CMR 2.0 or 2005 port with slightly updated graphics?As a mobile phone game, it's probably good, but as a PC game, it's a missed opportunity.Then again, this game doesn't really matter, since DiRT Rally is awesome :D"

The graphics are pretty bad considering it was made in Unity, and it doesn't actually feel like a game Codemasters would make. Still, it has that old Colin McRae Rally feel, unlike the other games Codemasters asked other studios to develop for consoles (hint hint DiRT 2.) Overall, this game is like Colin McRae Rally 2.0 for the Gameboy Advance- Bad graphics, but it still has the fun that you'd find in a normal CMR game."

It looks nice with hq textures, extra lighting and nice lookin reflections. It reminds me good old times when I played this game and that is what this game should do.Dont expect after simply remaster game something like Dirt:Rally or Drit3 with awesome graphics, steering model or realistic physics. If you played this game in childhood and really enjoyed it then I truly recommend this for you to bring memories back :)"

But seriously, don't buy this game. It's not terrible - it's just not very good. Graphically, it can't handle 4k properly, even though the menu allows you to select it. (It's ok if you just want to see the top-right quarter of the screen - though maybe that's just my graphics card doing something odd). Don't leave it for ten minutes whilst you go away to make a sandwich, because when your wireless controller powers down, the game can't detect it again and you're forced to finish your rally using the keyboard. If all you have is your phone and a particularly dull journey, it might pass the time. If you've got an old laptop from 1995 that can't run anything else, ditto.There are many better driving games out there - many of them made by Codemasters, who are top of their game when it comes to this sort of thing. This is an easy pop at the handheld market and should never have gone anywhere near a PC. Get any of the other Colin McRae / DiRT games and you'll have a much better time of things.Trust me.I'm a doctor.(That's not true, I'm an accountant. But they're almost the same thing)."
