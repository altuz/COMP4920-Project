,Recommended,287450,32617592,Posted: 21 June,all,arbuz,"For a start, this game is more sophisticated and complex than it seems at the first blush. Game mechanics are deep and many-sided, so it's always interesting to build your empire from scratch again and again.A notable feature is that resources are literally endless, therefore main emphasis is on waging wars and planning your economy and researches. That's what I always loved this game for: you develop a great power through its entire history like in Civilization, but battle as if you were playing AoE. Fighting enemies demands a lot of awkward micro-management tho' and I consider this a weak side of Rise of Nations.Every nation is well-balanced and extremely enjoyable to play for every country has its unique abilities (e.g. the Egyptians are impossible to compete in a wonder race, the Germans get their crucial industry upgrades earlier etc.). These elaborate features of nations enhance replayability many times.OK, disadvantages of the game are:1) slightly depthless diplomacy2) difficult to micro-manage units in battle3) getting units through the water is painNevertheless it's the best RTS I have ever played :)"

,Recommended,287450,23824944,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,Commissar Wheasal,"Game has one of my favorite late game features: The Armageddon Clock. Nukes are slow to build and expensive, but can be utterly devastating. The problem is each Nuke fired reduces The Armageddon Clock by one. If the clock reaches zero everyone loses, as the world is destroyed in a nuclear firestorm and a thousand year nuclear winter.The clock ticks ever down, and people quickly become scared to fire their nukes, lest a ""defeated"" player fires all their nukes and dooms everyone. A stalemate emerges.The game then becomes centered around the late game techs Missile Shield & World Government.Missile Shield stops people firing missiles into your territory, and each time it's researched instead of ticking down the Armageddon Clock ticks up, offering a brief chance at peace. The Missile Shield only stops people attacking you with Nukes though. Someone can still fire nukes defensibly if you try and attack into their land, or they can nuke their own land with a dozen missiles to trigger Armageddon.Cities when attacked normally take a few minutes to be annexed by the invader. World Government makes the countdown timer instant, and also means you instantly conquer any nation if you can take their capital. The Armageddon Clock might be low, but if you can make a surprise attack on your opponents capital and take it fast enough, they won't have the chance to fire them.However the most important thing is. When you play a massive free for all game always play with open diplomacy. Because at the end, there is a chance that the Armageddon Clock will lead to such a stalemate of MAD, the only solution is for everyone to ally up and have peace."

It's customizable enough so that a newcomer or veteran who would rather not worry about tech, econ, or combat can disable those elements in the starting menus.There are six economic resources in the game (three of which appear after appropriate research). Most combat units, buildings, tech, and upgrades cost one or two types of resources. They also tend to increase in cost the more of the same unit/building you have already built, which encourages players to diversify their buildings and units rather than just rebuild one type over and over.Combat units usually adhere to a rock/paper/scissors balance mechanic, although at later ages there are a decent range of specialized units that accomplish unique functions in warfare. Controlling a battle group is relatively intuitive - command buttons on the console also show shortcuts for the more-familiar player, and extra modifiers such as facing, General craft powers, and terrain also allow modest benefits for the detail-oriented player.Each nation has its own special powers, which lead to interesting matchups (although at higher levels of play, certain nation powers mandate a narrower choice of strategy than others).Those already experienced with RTSes can expect to jump right in and get playing against the AI competitively, and then jump online to test their skills against humans. This game may be a steeper learning curve for newcomers to the RTS genre because of its breadth of econ, tech, and military.Players who like modding their games will also find this game rewarding and versatile, including the ability to mod entire campaigns and to create new units in the game's .xml files.An excellent balance of accessibility and complexity. My favorite RTS game."

,Recommended,287450,13077423,"Posted: 25 November, 2014",all,Ank,"Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is a real-time strategy game from SkyBox Labs and previously Big Huge Games, published by no other than Microsoft Studios. It's a perfected version of Rise of Nations and Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots, all with new Steam features like achievements, cloud saving and more.Like many Microsoft games remake, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition retain exactly the very same gameplay and features from the previous 2 games, everything combined into a single game. If only like Age of Empires 2: HD Edition, the population limit is increased, this game might worth more. At least we get to see the old Conquer the World campaign along with the Thrones and Patriots new campaign such as the Cold War. For you who haven't play Rise of Nations before, the gameplay of this game is very good, start with a single city, build a library, college, market and expand your city, then build more cities and expand your empire into a great nation. Victory can be achieved through conquest, science or in this game called tech race, building wonders and there are more win condition for custom play.Rise of Nations: Extended Edition graphics are, well, it's said that the water and textures has been improved, and there is a new anti-aliasing effect, but me personally didn't see that great differences from the previous Rise of Nations, or maybe it's just been far too long. The graphics are classic, but good, very good, I'm not saying it's bad, it's just kinda still old. The performances are good, no lags or any kind of problems.Rise of Nations: Extended Edition however, have many room for improvements, if Microsoft really care. Maybe a DLC? Bad idea for most but at least there is an addition, maybe new unique units, new unique unit models for each nation (seriously, Russian launching F-18 Hornet from their carrier?), new campaign maybe the Roman campaign or something, even maybe new nation? Expansion Packs?Like many other too, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition has the Steam workshop support for community made custom content like maps, scenarios, even mods.But overall, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is a great game, very fun and with the new Steam features, even better. I recommend this.Rating 9/10"

76561198040702503,Recommended,287450,35031507,Posted: 17 September,all,DerEider,"Rise of Nations – Extended Edition{RoN}is a 2014 update of the ""old"" RTS from 2003, when it won severalGOTYawards forBig HUGE Games. Despite its age RoN has held up well, especially when I am in the mood for a quick Strategic War. A full-scale 1 v 3-or-4 game typically will run 60 minutes {game-time} or less. I take longer than that because I <Pause> a lot to peruse and consider new developments; effectively making RoN a TBS.Gamer may choose to play as one of roughly a couple dozen Nations {each with a unique set of units/advantages} and, in single-player mode, may select from among these nations which & how many, opponents to face.ORGamer may let the computer assign the nations randomly. Difficulty level may be adjusted from “push-over” Easiest to “almost impossible” Toughest. Pick a Map Style & Size and if the “Standard” settings are acceptable that's all you need to start. Otherwise in advanced settings, there are a large number of options including different victory levels, resource levels, technology cost & speed, beginning City status, population limit, etc. Also there are numerous Mods that may be added through Steam's Workshop. I like one that permits more farms per city & options for higher population limits. Gamer may create individualized maps or scenarios with a map/scenario editor.While RoN may not be quite as ""in-depth"" as Civilization, because of that RoN is a quick-to-learn game. Still, Gamer must develop and manage several types of resources & decide where and how to best build and expand one's Nation. There are various types of Victory depending upon the gamer's preferences or play style. There are Territory {% of world controlled}, Wonder {margin of Wonder Points over foes}, and Conquest {capture & hold all enemy capitals} Victories. Additionally, there are several special scenarios under “Game Rules” that set up alternative types of war; such as “Assassination”, “Peaceful Tech Race”, or “Musical Chairs”. RoN includes several Tutorial and Exercises style sub-games that are enjoyable to play separately for a quick RTS fix.RoN also includes what I categorize as aRISKcard-play style of war called “Conquer the World” that has several scenarios. The gamer may attempt to match the feats of Alexander or Napoleon. You may want to win the Cold War as either the CIA or the KGB!Cities:  Start with a capital plus 4 Villagers, a Scout, farms and a library to do your research. An alternate start is “Nomad” in which you have only 3 citizens and limited resources with which to found your “Empire”.  Cities are used to create new Villagers who farm the farms, mine the mines & cut the logs to fuel growth of the  gamer's Nation.Generally more cities should be founded to grow Gamer's Nation. A standard Territory Victory requires control of at least 70% of the “World”.  The percentage may be adjusted.Add logging camps, mines, more farms, caravans, fishermen, temples, universities with scholars and eventually oil wells to facilitate the RISE ofyournation.Maps: Depending upon one's preference, the  RoN World can range in size fromArena{good for a 1v1 war}, throughStandard{suggested for a 4 nation conflict}, up toHuge{after all RoN was developed byBig HUGE Games!} for up to 8 players. Basically if you want early conflict {like Ancient Age “rushes”}, go with a smaller map as opponents find each other sooner. On the other hand, a larger map with fewer opponents would tend to result in later attacks due to delays in discovery.Geography = Map “Style”: There are 2 dozen map Styles available; from “random” to Great Lakes, Amazon Rainforest, Australian Outback, Himalayas, Mediterranean {always popular for historical play}, or New World, etc.Military: Build the barracks, stables, seige factories, forts, towers, docks, air bases, and missile silos that will enable your Nation to overcome your implacable foes. Start with slingers, hoplites, and light horsemen and gradually upgrade them through “research” to assault infantry, anti-tank missiles, and main battle tanks. Air warfare begins in the Industrial Age with biplanes that may be upgraded to stealth fighters in the Information Age. Bombers are added in the Modern Age and these eventually may be upgraded to stealth bombers.Warfare: Create and field your army, air force & navy. Assign Generals with special battle enhancements to lead your armies. Send Spies to infiltrate and learn your foes' secrets or bribe their best units to join your side. Take advantage of the high ground or rough terrain. Dig in your troops on the defensive to reduce “splash” damage. Ambush an infiltrating force. Engage the enemy's army with a variety of “formations” to best take advantage of the situation. Gamer may allow an engagement to proceed on automatic or may choose to “get down in the dirt” and manually assign combat on a unit-by-unit basis to take best advantage of unit strengths versus a foe's unit weaknesses.Resources: Food, Wood, Metal, Oil, Wealth, & Knowledge basically are limitless and renewable. Output depends upon the number of production {e.g, logging camps or farms} and enhancement facilities {e.g., saw mills or granaries} created, and the number of Civilians assigned to a given resource. A given source point does not run out but may be lost to an enemy that expands its territory to encompass it.Time Line: There are eight stages of advancement from “Ancient Age” through “Information Age”. Optionally, gamer may start and end at any Age within that range of basically 4000 years. Each age brings with it unique new features and units.Technology Research: Building and unit upgrades, as well as Age advancements, are accomplished through research done either through the Library by Scholars at gamer's University or at the various production and military buildings.  Effective management of this research is a key to building a successful Empire. Each type of research requires a different mix of resources and is progressively more expensive as the Ages advance.Multi-player: RoN may be played MP on-line. However the latest version{1.20} appears to have made this difficult if not impossible. Version 1.10 still seems to function OKGraphics: RoN has excellent 3D graphics for its units and architecture. The styles are different for each Nation  and are varied for each change in “Age”. Units and buildings are attractively and effectively displayed in 3D.CONs: Army engagements may require gamer to micro-manage units to get the best results. Otherwise, the gamer may fall back to letting “Automatic” handle the engagement.Diplomacy is rather simplistic. It does allow trading of resources among allied players in Multi-Player games and it has a cute set of 99 verbal Taunts to send to other players {or listened to for your own amusement}.Amphibious warfare is a bit complex {not unlike the “real thing”}. 'Phib Ops requires selecting units within an assigned-numbered “Group”, moving that 'Phib Group into the water, moving the Group to the landing site with adequate naval protection, and ultimately transitioning the Group ashore in formation ready to attack/defend any opposing foe. Complicated but it can be quite effective when you pull it off !For the time-being, Multi-Player with the latest 1.20 version is Borked. However, some players in the Forum say they found a way to make it work.Recommendation: If you enjoy Strategy games RoN would be a good add to your Library; Easy to learn, Quick to play, Wide variety of play options. Build your Empire from the stone age up to the Information Age! RoN currently {SEP 2017} sells for $4.99 in the Steam Store, well worth the cost in terms of entertainment value."

The gameplay itself is still very challenging and complex, especially managing the resources and multi-tasking armies, like most other RTS games.Rise of Nations won many awards and presents execellent gameplay strategy and tactics due to it's realistic resource/market system. There's not many things that bring me more satisfaction than managing to get my resources going really well, and building up huge armies to invade enemy lands. The game itself is very complex, and with higher difficulties vsing the computer, it becomes very hard to win. The online in this game isn't very great, so I'd suggest playing 2v2 with bots when playing this game. Although you might think you'd feel like a loner, you definetely won't when you're managing an entire country, negotiating with your ally and crushing the enemies.The five main campaigns in this game is also superb. You could play as Napoleon, conquering europe by playing very fun and interesting scenarios, such as when you gain a few armies to invade a whole heavily guarded Egypt (10/10 historical). The graphics aren't that bad either, considering that I'm very picky on graphics. There are over 40~ countries to play as in Rise of Nations, each of them with their own set of unique powers and units.Overall, this game still remains a great RTS, with challenging and rewarding gameplay. There's no better feeling than managing to take over two countries via a huge campaign of sieging while the AI on your team does nothing but take the brunt of the enemy's force."

It's also still a bit of a mess in its late game moments, which I'll address a bit later.First off, for any new players donning their commander cap for the first time, what is Rise of Nations? It's best described, I think, as a cross between Age of Empires and Civilization. It is a real-time strategy game, first and foremost - worker units are recruited and instructed to gather the expected resources in food, wood, gold, iron, and later oil. They'll also construct military barracks, universities for gaining knowledge (which you'll spend to research technologies and advance through the ages), castles and forts for locking down territory, and perhaps most importantly of all - cities.You'll begin the match with one city. Structures like temples and forts will push your borders out a bit for you, but the only way to really expand your territory effectively is to build new cities. You can then recruit from your new city more villagers, which will proceed to build all the same farms, temples, lumber mills and schools you constructed at your first city - and eventually, you'll start the whole process over again. There's a great sense of satisfaction in watching each of your cities grow from a humble huddle of townhouses to its full sprawl of market, temple, barracks, school and more.Cities, as I mentioned, expand your borders, which are important primarily due to unit attrition. You can move your workers and military units within your own territory unfettered... but set foot on enemy lands, and you'll notice a red glow pulsing at their feet and a health bar that will slowly begin to dwindle. Supply wagons can be built, and as long as your units are within its effective range, they can pass into enemy lands without fear of damage. Should your wagon(s) be destroyed by the enemy, your units will immediately begin taking damage over time. In this sytem of attrition and supply, Rise of Nations creates a very unique combat game that can force the retreat of a march larger force or encourage players to slug it out along borders where they can effectively fight without fear of attrition.As stated above, you'll progress from the sticks and stones of the ancient world on through the crossbows and knights of the middle ages - the tanks and bombers of the World War II-era modern age, ending finally in the information age, where stealth bombers and ICBMs run amok. It's exciting and interesting to see what units will open up to you in each era, and every civilization has several unique units available to it throughout time that inject enough variety to encourance players to give them all a try.As I also stated above, the end-game of Rise of Nations is definitely its greatest weakness. One would expect the introduction of fighter jets, bombers, nuclear warheads and rocket artillery to be pretty exciting, right? Well, it mostly ends up creating a huge mess of a battlefield where's it's almost impossible to keep track of what's going on, who's killing who, or what's best effective against what. As nuclear warheads begin to drop and level cities, and certain technologies completely remove the wait time for recruitment (meaning you can keep clicking the ""Rocket Artillery"" icon and it will keep building them click after click after click instantly), the game loses any sense of cohesion and almost feels like a test of who can control complete and utter chaos.Luckily, the custom options in the game allow you to not only set a limit on how far the game can progress (IE: you can stop all further advancement at the Gunpower Age, so no one can build anything more advanced than a musket), but also how quickly you can advance. At the slowest settings, you'll likely be able to fight several battles with each age's loadout of units - though you'll also be waiting around quite a bit longer for your research to complete.Overall, I'm happy to report that Rise of Nations is still a whole lot of fun. It lacks the depth of a game like Civilization V, and the combat will feel pretty basic compared to more tenacious RTS fare Starcraft II and Company of Heroes 2 - but there's really something to be said for a game that can marry the territorial expansion and slog through time of the Civilization with more bread and butter RTS mechanics. It you enjoy strategy games, it's a steal at $20."

It is, naturally, better with friends - as most things are, except perhaps murder. Multiplayer on this game, especially with a tight group of close friends with whom you can have plenty of banter, just about beats every other RTS hands down. The thrill of armed combat across an enormous map (or Big Huge map as the game calls it) is gripping, and the delicate but simple mechanics of the Rise of Nations economy, and the associated feeling of a build up towards ""greater things"" (the Modern Age, where my favourite nation, Germany, receives all of its major bonuses) only intensifies.The game has a population cap of 250, which isn't acceptable in this day and age when most people posess relatively decent PCs can thusly run the game on much better graphics. In the community guides you'll find easy, quick techniques which will allow you and your friends to up the pop cap to 1,000. I highly recommend this - if you wish to play with up to 8 friends, all of whom you know, not only does it increase the enjoyment of the game but prevents any ""ganking"". If you have: 1. a superb economy, 2. the will to fight two enemies at once, 3. the micromanaging powers to maintain your homefront during any fight, you may well win! Being able to balance out an optimal amount of over 750 units (not including your civilian population, depending on how large it is) across the map, as well as being able to cover your frontiers, makes for an interesting as well as much more enjoyable game.TL;DR, this game is fun.

But it's the middle of the game where the meat is at; the rising tension of who is going to attack first and ""how best do I attack? Do I use a decoy army to confuse him? Or shall I go all in? How about I trickle cavalary units every so often to annoy him?"" The object of the game is to defeat your enemy by conquering his capital city (or if the timer runs out, most of the map)Moreover, the combat has a depth to it that makes it more than just ""whoever has the biggest army wins"", because the player can select a single type (such as cavalary) and target the enemy's archers with it (destroying them easily) or fleeing them from the brutal heavy infantry. The rock, paper, scissors mechanic (while certainly not new) prevents the game from becoming stale even though the player might have an increadibly large army.Furthermore, the economic management adds a light depth to the game when the player is not at war because he needs to constantly build new cities in order to increase his revenue and national borders (he cannot build outside his borders); tech is also needed to be able to upgrade units, increase caps and build new cities.In addition, the campaign mode resembles Europa Universalies or Total War (a turn based style map where the player picks his next target to wage war) and a selection of historic campaigns such as Alexander the Great or Napoleon. There is also an option to conquer the whole Earth.To conclude this short review (I have certainly left a lot out because I haven't played a lot of it - games are always more fun with friends - and I have non) I just want to mention a few negatives of the game because I think that many neglect this in their reviews and it infuriates me. Firstly, the graphics are outdated obviously and the resolution (although I think I read that there is a mod to fix this) is not 1080p; second, the maps (I haven't played many of the maps so take this with a grain of salt) are dull in my opinion because there is a lack of variety in the terrain (just hills, rocks and grass - maybe because it is an old game); third, citizens, when created, automatically (not sure if this can be turned off) go to work so I lose track of them and just end up having to pull citizens out of jobs if I need one to build something.Other than that, I can't fault the game as I find it fun, even on singleplayer. Games usually last 1 hour and can quickly be turned around if the palyer manages to repel a large enemy force.

Annoyed with waiting another turn in civ when you could just tell that f*cking worker to come here?RoN is the logical extension of that, it goes beyond the tried and true modalities of standard rts fare and achieves something hardly any other rts or for that matter game has tried.With the tech tree removed, the player doesn't have to wonder what logical pathways the authors followed when they had you go from wheel to the binocular to the atom bomb. What you've got here is streamlined: Pop cap bothering you? Military upgrade. Wanna expand? Civics. Commerce cap? Economy. Production too low? Science of course!And then you advance to the next age.Which does look substantially different. The architecture, the playstyle (in part), the units all look like they're really from the future compared to the loincloth wearing barbarians you started with.There are races, and they do get bonuses, which feel more like personalized cheat codes. What else would you call instant worker spawn (china), extra city expansion (zulus), 3 free horse archers per stable (mongols), 2 extra max farms (egyptians), no borders (some indian tribe), double capital (persians) etc.?WIth so many nations it's not hard to find one to suit your playstyle depending on what you feel in the morning.Little caveat: The game is ideological, the two types of government have a clear bias, one ""libertarian"" (democracy/republic/capitalism) against one ""authoritarian"" (despotism/monarchy/socialism). But it's not as visibly overbearing as what civlization does, where the difference between being LITERALLY FASCIST NAZI HITLER and a snarky liberal late night talk show host is wether you pick assembly line or the scientific method.What's more like age of empires is the warfare, it's the good old rock paper scissor we all love to hate: cavalry beats archer, archer beats infantry, infantry crushed beneath the treads of a tank, tank is nuked by the science civilization.The difference between one age and nother is evident, especially in gameplay, if you don't catch up you're dead behind.Castles and towers and barracks and siege workshops all work exactly like they did in aoe2, with the thing above as well as expanding and contracting borders.Especially with the HD re-release, everythign is polished and overpolished, with one click you can get into multiplayer or stream on twitch or start a mod up."

It is a gem of the strategy genre that many are yet to experience, and should soon.Difficult to point out special virtues in RoN. Perhaps the 18 technologically and aesthetically delineated civilisations, or the fast-paced urban improvements and clever use of the Academy as the core of a settlement's upgrades. Perhaps the military attrition that has just the right rhythm, allowing both the player and their opponents to constantly and progressively advance in warfare capacity and strength, and in a match each invasion feels like a whole new emotion - much harder to bring down an adversary in one shot here.It is also commendable the way BH Games found to display a balanced, yet challenging temporal advancement system that takes you from the classic age to contemporary conflicts and geopolitics. You improve your technologies and expand your settlement across the neighbouring territories (and yes, the territories are another exciting feature in RoN) as you are justly rewarded with the chance of gripping at the next moment in human progress. I've seen few strategy games in which age advance is so balanced and perceptible through the player's actions and upgrade management (a system very similar to Empire Earth II, by the way).The Extended Edition looks fresh, especially visually. However, and this could be something particular to my system – I’m yet to find out –, the buildings and upgrades icons are missing, and I hope a future update shall remedy this little issue (edit: it is apparently a first-launch issue; for those having the same problem, just quit and restart the game, and all icons should be back on). Apart from that, looks like good old RoN to me thus far.Rise of Nations can snatch many an hour out of your weeks, a strategy masterpiece with which I have a history, not in vain, since its replayability factor is always able to drag me back to it and renew that history bringing to it more pleasurable gaming experiences. Besides, I can finally say that Steam has come miles closer to bringing all my dream games to its repertoire."

The design was extremely innovative when the game came out in 2003, and nothing since then has even come close.It takes the pacing and tactics of games like Age of Empires and Starcraft and combines them with the depth and strategy of games like Civilization. The result is something truly awesome.There are a lot of different ways to customize games, so each player can set up games to suit his or her style of play.The competitive play is very rewarding and challenging and really puts an emphasis on strategic decision-making. The balance isn't perfect, but the game has random maps that are different every time so that players are forced to adapt instead of memorizing build orders.Playing casually is also rewarding and fun. Unlike other multiplayer RTS games that can feel like hard work instead of enjoyable entertainment, Rise of Nations doesn't require constant attention and giving orders all over the map at insane speeds (although you can control  your units like that if you want to). It's the ideal RTS for people who don't have the speed, energy, focus, and free time of teenagers.Most RTS games are a miserable experience unless the matchmaking is perfect and opponents are very close in skill level. Rise of Nations is different. The design of the game and the different modes ensure that fun and exciting games are commonplace instead of being a rare event.The game has an extensive tech tree and lots of depth, but the learning curve is excellent as it lets you gradually discover what you need to know. There are lots of different civilizations with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. All of this makes the balance less than ideal, but it ensures that the game doesn't get stale or repetitive, even after thousands of hours of play.Rise of Nations represents the best strategy gameplay in the RTS genre. It's not a perfect game, but it comes closer than anything else. It's entirely possible that we will never see a game quite like this again.

It is *not* comparable, however, to another game of a similar title called Rise of Legends - a fantasy based RTS with no progression of ages.The progression of ages. A time-tested technique mastered by Sid Meier's Civilizations franchise through a multitude of wildly successful (and less successful) grand strategy titles. This game takes what is good about Civ (what isn't good?) and transmogrifies it from turn-based to real time fast-paced action. That being said, there are some differences including a greater emphasis on combat and diplomacy that is less diplomatic. But fortunately for us and the more sensitive individuals at Dhruva Interactive, Ghandi won't be declaring war on anybody on turn eight and using nukes several centuries of ""non-violent"" war later. No, you do not take control of notable historical figures, at least not in standard skirmish.There are, however, several historical-based grand map campaigns not dissimilar to those of the Warhammer 40K Dawn of War title released in 2004. Napoleon's short-lived crusade or the wars for the Americas, the span of history this game covers is quite vast. As for graphics this game has aged well.

I just purchased it on steam but I've had it for years on CD. Therefore few hours in steam.Rise of Nations is a real-time strategy game. You start off in Ancient age where you build yourself some farms and gather wood for future uppgrades.This game is all about uppgrading from Ancient age into the much familiar Modern age, and ofcourse the more you uppgrade ages the better your units and overall income will be.In RON you have "" territory "" being the area around your camp/settlement. You are limited to this area and can only build in this area. One exception being the small city ( a new city ).You can expand your territory by building a new city somewhere close to your current one.Having more cities will allow you to maintain some gold income and start the trading business.There are also limits to how many farms, scholars, and trade caravans you can have each city. Therefore expanding is a must.I want to add that in normal mode the game has a sudden death mode. If a player reaches a goal in territory. Having an extreme lead in territory percentage, that player will win in 4 minutes.There are ofcourse several ways and modes to play in RON. You can choose wether you want a fast game where you get resources faster and you rush the enemy, you can choose economic game where you gather lots of resources before the big battle, sudden death by wonders and many more.In RON you build wonders. Like the great pyramide and statues. Theese wonders will grant you benefits like more income from mining, lumber, higher population limits.What I like about Rise of Nations would be the evolving battles. At first you start off with a handfull of men throwing rocks, using bows and spears. Then after a little while you get horses, catapults and attack ships.You uppgrade and suddenly you have riflement, tanks, battleships and airplanes.The huge battle after you have found oil and starting to build nuclear weapons and bomb planes. Having units with flamethrowers and bazookas. The feeling when your gigantic formation of soldiers  destroys the enemy city and you claim that city as your own.Rise Of Nations is inexpensive and fun to play. The best strategy game I've come across this far.I would recommend this game to anyone being a fan of strategy games!"

,Recommended,287450,20410436,"Posted: 8 January, 2016",all,[ARX]AnthonyPS,"This is one of my all-time favorite games, and this game also means a lot to me since it's one of the earliest game I played with my best friend that's 9000 miles away from me now. Even though I played a LOT of different games during my time playing Rise of Nations, I always spent some time playing this game. I am no expert even though I spent hundreds of hours playing this game, since I only play games for fun, not to be a master at it. I did use the cheats for fun (cheat nuke on Classical age LOL) and it results to my lack of the skill to play the game. So pardon my incapability to speak about the technical details of the game.The reason I spent so much time fooling around back then rather than seriously trying to master the game was because the fact that Rise of Nations is very fun to mess around with. You have a sandbox mode where you can pretty much create any scenario you want or make any kind of battles. The built-in cheats are also very fun to play with. I play games for fun, not to win.Now about the game type, Rise of Nations is a classic old RTS game. You gather resources, build buildings & upgrades, build an army, attack your enemy and destroy their cities. It's just like Warcraft III's multiplayer (not dota, dota is a mod), Age of Empire, Stronghold Crusader, StarCraft, etc. These kind of games had its golden age back in early 2000s. Now, it's mostly dominated by Total War series, which are way more complicated and detailed since it's more focused on realism and strategy rather than the old RTS games, which are focused on the balance between building and combat. Old RTS games tend to be much more simpler due to limited technology at that time + they must have doubt people will like complex realistic strategy game, until Total War showed its success with Total War Medieval. Rise of Nations started to implement some complexity in-game by giving the effects of the terrain on the unit's performance, attritions, upgrades, more resources types, etc rather than a simple build-and-attack RTS game, but its gameplay is still kept simple and easy to learn.Rise of Nations offers a lot of choices in the game by giving you a lot of nations, ages, game mode and maps to choose. You can fight on air, sea, and land with a lot of unit types. Each nation has their own unique units, which are usually the iconic units of the country (e.g British's Scottish Highlander, US's Continental Marines, Russia's T-80 tank, German's Tiger Tank, etc). The ages is a really good system that rarely got implemented in other RTS games. I only know Age of Empire also implemented this but it was very limited, and Empire Earth, just like RIse of Nations also implemented a large amount of choices for ages. Each ages has their own unique strategy and play style, offering way more variety to the gameplay.The game itself is without question, heavily unbalanced. For example, Chinese's ability to instantly generate citizens itself is already very OP, allowing rapid constructions all over the territory and rapid resource gathering. I doubt the devs will do anything about this in the future since there are A LOT of elements in the game that are tied to one another but it's still definitely fun to play. If you're looking for a simple, fun, and easy to learn RTS games, Rise of Nations is definitely a good choice. You can also check out Empire Earth if you don't mind ugly graphics and small unit count for the same amount of fun. Rise of Nations is like the upgraded version of Empire Earth, it looks much better and the gameplay is much better too.TL;DR It's simple, has a very large variety of gameplay, very easy to learn but hard to master, mediocre but acceptable graphics and animations (it's a 2003 game give it a break), and super fun gameplay."

Plus a campaign which pefected what we would now call the ""metamap"" system.

Certainly the best rts in a histroical setting.Even if you already own the original, it's might be a little harder to justify, but it does have working multiplayer through steamworks(the original used gamespy, which was terrible and now defunct), and then there's just the convenience of having it in your steam library.

Legends was done a lot better in my opinion but came at a later date.None the less though expect a European Wars Cossacks style of play. The only difference here is you cannot build wherever you'd like. The campaign plays as so : you are given the choice of scenarios or are allowed to choose your own map to conquer (I chose the world map to conquer). You have different races to choose from with each their own tactical ability. What separates this game and what I like about it is that the more research you do, the more you are allowed to build (no duh right), but you are allowed to build cities a certain distance away from one another and establish trade routes. Serfs are needed to harvest food (5 farms per city), or can be told to gather wood (need to build a wood cutting camp), and iron and oil can respectively be collected. Buildings such as lumberyards are available to make your lumber gather skills better (likewise for food and iron).The fighting is an RPG style of play and the formations the units line up in are awesome. Preparing your units for battle and lining them up accordingly and to which angle is made beautifully. They followed the idea of Knights and Merchants when it came to telling units in which direction to point - except this one does a better job of it.After a fight (or before a fight) you have an overview of your world map and from here can use strategic cards to your advantage or tell units where to move. You may also upgrade your current country's wealth.Back in the day this game would have received a higher rating from me, but as we are living in the present day and have quite the variety of games I will have to give it a 7.0/10.

Although it isn't as comprehensive as the technology tree of Civilization III, Rise of Nations' research fields are still broader than those of just about any other real-time strategy game yet. There are four main areas of research: military, civil, commerce, and science. Each area has eight levels, as well as a top-level technology for each area once you reach the eighth stage. However, each of these technologies is balanced fairly well against the others, so you're free to choose the technological path you most prefer without worrying that your unbalanced research might leave you vulnerable in some way. Additionally, you'll conduct most of your research in a single building: the library. The consolidation of most of the game's technology under one roof is a breakthrough in logistics--you no longer have to go hunting for different buildings to conduct research.Like Age of Empires, Rise of Nations features eight different ages: classical, medieval, gunpowder, enlightenment, industrial, modern, and information. Even though game's timeline begins in the Dark Ages and ends in a futuristic era, it manages to strike a perfect balance between the different ages and the breadth of technologies available in each. And despite all that depth, Rise of Nations is paced well and isn't overly complex--the game's interface makes it easy to understand what you need to do to advance to the next age, and the resource costs of advancement are challenging to meet without being ridiculously expensive.The only really serious complaint that hard-core strategy fans could level at Rise of Nations is that the game doesn't have a story-based campaign like so many other recent real-time strategy games. Instead, Rise of Nations features a single-player ""conquer the world"" campaign in which the world is divided into sections, like in the classic board game Risk. You start out as one nation on this map and attempt to literally conquer every other country in the world. Controlling your nation on the world map is turn-based, but when you enter into territory you don't control, the game changes to real-time mode. Interestingly, the campaign offers different scenarios for different territories. In one territory, your mission might be to withstand a barbarian raid for 30 minutes. In another, it might be to race across a map to destroy a barbarian encampment. In a contested territory, you might have a normal conquest game in which you must eliminate the enemy. Capturing and holding additional territories gives you benefits, such as an extra army or resource bonuses you can take with you into every tactical battle. However, this campaign, which is really just a glorified version of Risk, isn't as developed as the actual real-time game. Still, it's enjoyable, if a bit simple, and it adds a substantial single-player component to the game."

Instead I will focus entirely on what this Extended Edition brings to the table, and if the promoted features are of any importance to you: the consumer. So let's go.Rise of Nations: Extended Editionis a re-release of the classic RTS from Big Huge Games. But rather than just slapping a ""Works on Windows 8"" sticker on the packaging and calling it a day, the developer of this ""Extended"" edition decided to get creative and add someimprovementson the original game. That's a fine idea in of itself. It's an older game, and can't quite compete with modern games from the genre. But was it necessary, and did it actuallyaddanything of value to the game?No. In short, no, absolutely not. The visual improvement added to the game were - in no way - a neccessity. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that they lower the value of the product. The enhancements include (but are not limited to): Faster animations for units, new smooth shadow effect for 3D models, blown out brightness, colours and contrast in menus, animated backgrounds replaced with static images, asubtlebloom effect, and ""terrain depth"".What does any of this mean? The game looks, and feels, very different from the game you remember. And no, it's not just from my rose-tinted glasses. Boot up the original game and have a look for yourself, the original - unextended - still works just fine, and then compare it with some images from this one. The EE looks... cheaper. I can't say I care much about the menu being broken, but the ingame improvements takes a bit getting used to. Luckily a few of them can be turned off, but many cannot be changed back.However.Having said that. It still plays the same as it always did, and that's really all we should care about. Yes, the changes are weird, useless, and somewhat overpriced, but it's still RISE OF NATIONS on Steam! With gamespy-free multiplayer! And workshop support! (And built-in streaming through Twitch, if you're into that sort of thing). So in the end, this ""Extended"" game is worth it - if you want it to be. No more CDs. No more multiplayer through Hamachi. No more ini-tweaks for higher resolutions. Just press Play and go."

It was one of those games I'd go back to year after year, I managed to get several friends in the meantime hooked on the game. It was contagious, as they'd occasionaly let their friends in on it. However, many of us had to rely on Gameranger for it to work, as not only was Gamespy a POS, different versions of the game didn't work with eachother correctly. For example, buying the gold version which was the normal game and its expansion didn't work with someone who had the expansion but didn't get it via gold version. So multiplayer was a weird hassle on this, and difficult to acquire legally. Then it showed up on Steam, answering all these problems.It's an amazing RTS, and has some elements of Civ V that aren't really seen in other RTS games.

For 10 years this has been the high-water-mark of the genre, and most of us who had it on day 1 are veteran players of those 10 years. For those of you who don't know (and I guess that's why you're reading this after all) Imagine if Total War had a lovechild with Age of Empires. There's a turn-based global map where your civilization expands and fights on their way to world domination, and each turn there are battles for the territory you wish to gain or hold.Each nation has an innate advantage, and with the building of world wonders on the global map, can be enhanced further, while resources from captured territory are available in later battles too. All of this might make you think that the RTS part is less vital, but in fact the action is just as hot down there. A wide range of units and technologies in each historical period are on hand to take down enemy settlements, and a variety of defensive structures to hold them off.On a downside, there are a number of known bugs right now, but the devs are releasing regular patches to deal with those."

All resources are renewable, so you don't end up mining all the gold and stone while chopping down every tree on the map that late game Age of Empires can turn into. The UI is amazing (top left corner tells you the income rate for each resource) and the control group system is better than any other RTS out there. You can set a unit to be the waypoint of buildingss, and newly created units will join the control group(s) of that waypoint unit.The attrition/border system, the wonders, and the fact that the time frame of RoN spans from the Stone Age to the Information Age will make RoN feel like a Civilization game in RTS form, and that's definitely not a bad thing.

You research four different categories Military, Civics, Commerce, and Science to progress from Ancient Age to Information Age (full on stealth bombers and nukes). There are tons of different civs to choose from, each one featuring its own unique units and civ bonuses. Where Rise of Nations really shines, though, is in its Conquer the World Risk-style campaign. This is hands-down one of the best single player experiences you are likely to get. Not only is it the best implementation of this style of campaign gameplay but each overworld encounter can lead to a multitude of different scenarios in the RTS proper. It's still my favorite campaign style ever made and it's a real shame it never caught on in other games.So really, why should you buy this? Because even with theslightlyoutdated graphics this is still one of the best RTSes made of all time. This Extended Edition re-release simply makes a great game even better, with tons of multiplayer improvements across the board (especially as this game was originally hosted by now defunct Gamespy).

You start in the early ages of wooden sticks and tools and slowly (or quickly if you change the settings) to the industrial age of muskets and redcoats and then even all the way up to the modern day age with nuclear weapons, tanks and machine guns.This games has some features that I really like that other RTS's of this type don't have. These are things such as territories based on cities and castles you make, attrition damage to enemy or neutral nations in your territory and the ability to cause the game to end as a draw by the over use of nuclear weapons on a map.There is a conquer the world campaign that can be done but requires hours and hours to complete which might leave some players bored but great supporters of the game to enjoy. It, in the simplest explanation possible, is a turn based map in which you chose to invade each time, another location to attack which leads into a RTS battle each time in which the winner takes the territory. This can cause some players to get bored of this but many game types are added into the battles to cause a variety of gameplay.Overall I think ""Rise of Nations"" is an amazing game which takes some of the greatest bits of other strategy games and combines them with unique ideas to create this masterpiece. 10/10 recommend this game."

Both are published by Microsoft, they all share the same basic UI, game objectives, etc. However, Rise of Nations is not just another AOE clone. There is many genuine differences between these games. In RON, the major difference is the ability to advance your nation's time period until the modern age. You start off in an ancient time period, and gradually by gathering resources and building workers and buildings, progress through time. So you start off with bows and arrows and you (hopefully) will have airplanes, tanks, and nukes by the end of the game. So although the game is very similar to AOE, there is some major gameplay differences that seperates them. Personally I find RON a better overall game, although both games are amazing.Anyways, back to RON, I find the gameplay is solid, but looks rather dated like you may expect from such an old game.  Unit fighting animations are also really basic, so don't expect the level of detail you would see in Total War or COH. However, there are tons of nations to play as, and each has specific bonuses. Unit variety is good, each faction has special units (example Germany has MG42 squad).The age advancing mechanic is really interesting, but unnfortunately it seems the technology gap is never very far apart between players, and despite what you do you will all get the same units at about the same time. I was hoping I would get to pit some battles between tanks and infantry vs archers and chariots, except by the time I have those units, others players are developing those units too, despite how well I had been playing. The difference between ages is generally not too far apart, although there is many custom settings you can change to make it harder to progress to new ages. Just a small complaint, but generally something that can be changed in the custom game setup.Overall, this is a great game. For it's age it's an excellent RTS. At times I find the progession rather straightfoward, but the sheer amount of units, countries and game modes makes up for its shortcomings. Defnitely a great game to buy even if you own all the Age of Empires games, I would reccomend this to all RTS fans looking for a new game!"

,Recommended,287450,10480652,"Posted: 15 June, 2014",all,James the Gryphon,"An epic classic that combines the elements of a more complex game like Civilization, with the less management based feeling of games like Age of Empires. A strange blend that somehow works for the better. If you're an RTS fan looking for a new stallion for the stable, or a Civilization fan looking for something a little bit more fast pased, then short answer is you'll probably like this.Now, the long answer is that this game is a blend of the empire management features from Civ, such as working about captured 'rare resources', expanding the available territory you own, and harvesting resources without them being harvested away completely.From Age of Empires, the game draws the faster pased action of the mixed unit combat, and the tactical rock-paper-scissors between units, along side the actual building of cities and structures, and rapid pase of gameplay to advance through the ages.However, Rise of Nations brings fresh concepts to the table, such as units in foreign territory having to deal with 'attrition' which slowly drains their health unless kept in supply with wagons. As well as a VERY customizable single AND multiplayer game hosting which allows you to adjust a fair few options to better suit your playstyle, and nations to support this without being cripplingly overspecialized.The biggest negatives I can point to in this particular incairnation of the series are that the water reflection graphical option seems to cause severe lag issues on older, more middle range computers, and that the game itself does NOT like to be alt-tabbed in any sense, I myself have had issues where doing this causes my entire computer to lag severely, and re-enlarging the game has causes the in-game audio to drop out. Also, the largest maps seem to perhaps have issues with not playing well when hosted, often causing players to drop. Perhaps the worst though is that there is MINOR desync between players when the matches get particularly heavy, with multiple nations and massive armies squaring off, but even then it's minor at worst.If you're willing to put up with a game that's got a few warts, being pretty much a re-release of an existing game, then Rise of Nations is a definate consideration. If you're looking for a unique, very underappreciated gem in the RTS genre, then by all means consider the game. If you're looking for a perfect diamond that fixes all the existing issues, then please consider something else, or just don't complain when it isn't flawless."

You will go from spears and bows to attack helicopters, battle tanks and nuclear warheads. the idea of only being able to build most buildings inside the territory you control offers a slightly different dynamic to most RTS games, as do the small bonuses you get from accessing specific resources.The building resources you start out with are the usual food, gold and wood, but as you progress through the ages you gain access to metal and oil, and throughout the game you also need to accumulate knowledge from the scholars at your universities in order to research new technologies.If the game has one flaw it's that once you become proficient at it you will advance through the ages too quickly to ever really feel like you're in a particular period of history, although you can set the game options to prevent any player from progressing past a specific point. For example, if you would like to wage war with muskets and cannon you set set the game to not progress beyond the Enlightenment Age. If you want to fight the world wars, set it to stop at the Industrial or Modern Age.Rather than go with a particular historical character, like Age of Empires does, the Rise of Nations campaign allows you to pick any nation and fight for territories to conquer the entire world, from the Stone Age to the Information Age. The Thrones and Patriots expansion also gives you the option of fighting the Cold War (which doesn't really make any sense in an RTS game, to be honest, as this was gets pretty hot), the Napoleonic Wars (as Napoleon), follow in the footsteps of Alexander the Great or the New World.It's a lot of fun and well worth playing for any fan of RTS games."

76561198032742599,Recommended,287450,13079981,"Posted: 25 November, 2014",all,BurningLegion,"Rise of Nations is an older RTS with a gimmick few others have dared attempt. Rise of Nations permits players to advance through eight ""ages"", representing all of human history from the classical Greco-Roman empires all the way to the modern day. Critically, Rise of Nations manages to be engaging every step of the way.Only one other RTS I know of shares Rise of Nation's gimmick - Empire Earth, a game with an inarguably stronger focus on detail and historical accuracy (And the addition of cool future ages). However, where Empire Earth excels in its detail and its mimicry of the sweeping changes in warfare which occur between each great technological age (and the complete uselessness of obsolete units), Rise of Nations is more accessible and more streamlined for the sort of gameplay both games forward.The traditional RTS formula is a worker unit is sent to collect resources, it collects until its capacity is full, and then it returns the load to a central gathering point. This continues until the worker is killed, resources run out, the gathering point is destroyed, or the worker is given a different order. This is the formula used by StarCraft, StarCraft II, Age of Empires, Age of Empires II, Empire Earth, Empire Earth II, and nearly every other RTS game. It's a good system - it forces players to keep expanding to acquire new resources, attaches a hard limit to the amount one worker can help the economy, and gives the OPFOR plenty of opportunities to interrupt supply shipments.Rise of Nations breaks from tradition in this respect. In Rise of Nations, it is necessary to construct specialized gathering points for each resource - Mines for metal, Farms for food, Woodcutter camps for Timber, Universities for Knowledge, and Oil Wells for Oil. Farms, Oil Wells, and Universities produce a set amount of their respective resources per worker garrisoned in them, and each have their own unique rules. Mines and Woodcutter camps have different maximum garrison capacities depending on exactly where they're placed - a small mountain may mean a Mine can only have three workers, but a huge forest may let a Woodcutter camp have ten. Once the gathering point has been constructed and the workers garrisoned, the gathering point provides a set amount of resources every 30 seconds until destroyed or the workers are given other tasks (Resources never run out).In Empire Earth, the core gameplay is about the military-industrial complex. It takes so long to replace dead units and destroyed buildings that the game becomes about forcing the enemy away from those things. With resources scattered across the map, elements of risk are inescapable and it's just a reality that there will be no effective central organization of any army since walling a settlement in is so expensive. Everything you do in Empire Earth relates back to protecting your military buildings because if they are destroyed you won't get an opportunity to replace them.In Rise of Nations, core gameplay is about map control. Map control is represented by ""territory"", multicolored lines drawn on the land itself to show which player has control of what. Territory grants a lot of benefits - it increases the firing rate of your artillery, damages enemy units, lets you place down buildings, and can grant other abilities depending on your nation specialty. The earliest, and most significant, provider of territory are cities. You begin the game with one city, and it is by cities that Rise of Nations is won or lost. If your capital city is taken, you have a limited amount of time to take it back or every building you own defects to the player who took your capital and all your units commit hara-kiri. Needless to say, you're defeated. The city is more than just a gaping strategic vulnerability, however - it's the biggest sole provider of territory, and the biggest contributor to a player in Rise of Nations.Cities have a radius, called an ""economic radius"", within which they provide extra health to buildings and can supercharge the gathering rates of resource structures by up to three times. Additionally, some buildings can only be built in cities (Universities, Markets, Oil Refineries, Granaries, Lumber Mills, Smelters, Senates, Temples, Libraries, Farms). Most of these buildings are huge contributors in Rise of Nations, so cities are very important. A city can be upgraded, with its economic radius and benefit to building health growing as more types of buildings are constructed in it. On top of that, cities heal units garrisoned inside them and themselves fire on enemy units if there are units inside the city. Accordingly, a city and its civilians can stand off military units acting alone. Cities also provide small incomes of Food and Timber.Cities are automatically named after historical cities of that nation, but can be renamed. Everything you do in Rise of Nations goes back to your cities, back to the complicated web of buildings you've constructed in them. Ultimately, even special world wonders can be constructed in cities to provide unique bonuses to your nation.And that brings us to the military aspect. War is very much a part of Rise of Nations, and it is the best way to win matches. In Empire Earth and most RTs games, it is necessary to order every individual soldier, but Rise of Nations offers us something called an ""infinite queue"" which causes a building to repeat its build orders until the building is destroyed, resources run out, or the population limit is reached. The infinite queue changes RTS warfare by letting a game as macro as Rise of Nations be about the macro. With enough resources, it is not merely possible but practical to overrun an opponent with sheer numbers or keep an airbase constantly supplying planes to a beleaguered front. But merely because I am a fan of the hammer that is a horde of thousands of soldiers charging doesn't mean there aren't other, more tactical options available. There are. Generals passively increase the survivability of your soldiers and offer special abilities useful for outmaneuvering and outguessing opponents while spies can make enemy units spy for you or actively turn them to your side and explorers kill enemy spies, blow up buildings, and snipe vulnerable military units. Missile silos can blow up any specific enemy building with a cruise missile, or devastate the economic radius of a fully mature city with a nuke. Airbases send out fighters to pick off enemy units, kill generals and shoot down bombers or launch brute waves of their own bombers to batter down enemy buildings. Attack helicopters pick off ridiculous numbers of tanks and submarines for their cost while being immune to any return fire. Ranged cavalry and armored cars can pick off generals and supply wagons to let enemy soldiers die from territory damage, or conduct deep raids to kill enemy workers and weaken their economy. On top of all this, special generals are available from the Senate who provide unique benefits in addition to game-long bonuses to your nation.In addition, strategic resources are available which both provide additional income of basic resources but offer special abilities (Some of which are more or less overpowered). Basically, who your nation is and precisely what its good at evolves dynamically through the game based on what opportunities are available, what is exploited, what you started with, and what your opponent(s) do. On top of all this, there's a highly amusing ""conquer the world"" mode which serves as the game's campaigns. Basically, this mode links all the battles you fight to tell the story of a great empire from the beginning of its history to the day it conquered the world or failed to do so.But the best part of Rise of Nations is how it all comes together. I'm about at the character limit, so take the fact that I'm not even close to done talking speak for itself. I highly recommend it if you have any room in your heart."

If thats not enough the fact that you can control so many diffrent units and even sub-units of the same class based on what tech. level you are at. A comparison would be If you've ever played Age Of Empires how you tech through diffrent ages, well same goes for Rise Of Nations BUT you go further down the tech. tree to advanced units like tanks, aircraft carries, stealth bombers and even NUKES and other missles.

Don't let my low game time fool you, I have burned hundreds of hours on this game before it's port to steam. The only reason I switched was because of ease of multiplayer lobbying with my friends around the world.Sporting an incredibly easy to pick up and intuitive economy and military system, it remains deeply versatile and there is alot more than meets the eye in terms of depth. A game that truly takes 10 minutes to learn but a lifetime to master, this is the strategists best friend.Units and construction are simple enough, but offer sufficient variety to keep things interesting and plenty of options when it comes to your military keeps wafare fun and challening rather than repetitive and simplistic.The soundtrack is phenomenal, truly a highlight of each and every game. Not one game passes without me getting pumped up by the late stage combat music or the nerve inducing sounds of your immenent demise at the hands of a conquering enemy.This will forever be my favorite RTS, even my favorite strategy came period, and always in my top three games of all time.Even at $20 this game is a great buy for the RTS fan, but wait a month and it's sure to come on sale as it invariably does quite regularly.

Basically it is like a working, interactive detailed encyclopedia of sorts that offers a tough thorough challenge. One that flows meticulously and smoothly takes you transitioning through the centuries whilst ''turning the page'' culminating in the modern 'Information Age', which is in my opinion somewhat of an unique element to this game and a rare techno-thriller-esque aspect in this particular genre as well as is in gaming overal..Game has a lot to choose from, a lot to do involving a variety of Nations.. that 'rise' through the ages. There is a lot to explore in this context alone and baring such design choices as to have it reflect realism, be in real-time and having great detailed amount of depth are a few reasons for mebesidestheengaging combatto really like the game (love it). Many possibilities here, you can basically adjust any of the settings and parameters to go and have a fight in any of the 8 ages for instance. The game is Huge and has much potential in regards to gaming and where it manages to take it.Action wise gameplay has RTS-style micromanagement system set in place that is very detailed and refined. Kinda important considering that this is a classic (or rather; aremakethereof). The game is controllable in real-time and is not 'alien' to these types of games consisting of a vast variety of military units to choose and to build from with various roles to engage in with regards to their application on the battlefield: the game has a lot of variation to offer based on the factions and thus the (various) units alone. Combat wise game consists of Sea Air and Land units that are upgradable as you go on, advancing through time as you build your cities growing your nation and thus expand thy borders. This building/advancing is done through the in game 'tech-tree' which I was amazed by because it is like an 'RPG'-mechanic well integrated into the game. Very smart.On top of this action phase the game has a base building mechanic (cities) that adds such a strategic layer to the gameplay on top of the already rich and detailed tactical combat elements with an adjustable A.I. difficulty to choose from that make it ''come to life'' when playing against the computer opponent or opponents that are tweakable a-lot, advanced and in this way quite detailed and customizable like the rest of the game is. This is important because it makes the learning and getting into the game easier and holds it 'alive' and relevant''even'' todayas it were, in a sense making it ''never'' get repetitive boring and 'old' but rather grow into something that is like a fine wine and thus ages as such, getting better with time (relative to ones skill advance).A point to note is that when in the heat of the moment, in battle engagements; the action feels very accurate and tactile sort of like a simulation would be and thus the 'build-up' can get very intense and is great fun.. as far as 'slaughtering your opponents' goes orcounts(in a virtual sense of these words), I guess. It is the part ofissuing commandsandassimilating othersthat is so fun. One point about the game is that it isn't overly complicated once passed the initial learning threshold and gained insights that come through experience will aid you might you choose to bend, rather to brake that is.. It is familiar and that's a good thing I think (considering classic RTS-games). A bit dated, it is and this is noticeable but in my opinion not a 'biggy' as in anegative.Positive thing about the game (depending on your preference andultimatelypatience/skill) is that the in game 'rounds' tend to last for a long time, like in hour or hours so in this sense the whole experience is exhilarating. The source of resources grows steady from within your cities allowing for more freedom of time thus more space to spend on planning, building your base and preparing your troops once you get the correct build order you can then work on your general strategy and on your tactics as inwhat to doandhowto actually execute an offensive plan. In the mean-while in this regard; remember these few things:Despite having these resources available to manage and fine-tune it is imperative to ''catch'' the 'pendulum swing' at the right time with regards toattackingin the rounds or otherwise you'll be having to play catch-up when it comes to your army and depending on the difficulty base defense won't always work (specially considering enemies swarming at higher difficulties and later in the rounds the 'Nuke'-factor). In this regard: Attacking is key asoffense is best defenseand as you can't really defend that efficiently unless you attack and capture opponents territory that's exactly what they'll be doing to you. In this regard a lot of it is all aboutright timingas in: when to act (attack & expand) opposed to when [not to] act (defend and react).Enemies are persistent and smart therefore making these rounds filled with intense long-lasting and rich tactical combat, where enemies will flank you using multiple armies and basically throw everythingandthe kichen sink at you which is in my opinion another added bonus from the gameplay itself; that it: isn't short, that it is detailed, tough, varied and extensive; that it is basically so similarlytrue to lifein regard to the nature of the lore itself (conflict;war).This 'tick' or knack (for timing) is something that is prevalent throughout the whole game and might add yet another layer to the depth of the whole because of the various timers and counters involved. This is a game that is admittedly 'all in all' difficult to master, but manageable to get into and appealing to stick with because of its layered structure even though at first play-troughs it might come as overwhelming and confusing 'Rise of Nations' is like a somewhat more advanced game of chess (in 'real-time') with similar ''basic'' true & tried mechanics thatworkbut what otherwise feelsfar-reachingand having so many more possibilities within the gameplay rooted in the graphics design, sound esthetics along with the games mechanics (and the 'A.I.') that make the complete game experience lively spectacular and engaging even for such agreatclassic."

I remember asking my father what he was doing. ""I'm playing a video game, son"". From that point on I've been gaming. Anyway, when got steam in somwhere around december 2011/2012 I immediately jumped to the first 4X game I could find, Civ V. And now im here, reviewing what could be better or worse than civ, in my opinion.RoN draws many similarities to AoE, wherin you control your units in realtime, building cities, marching armies, and advancing through technological ages, all simultaneously to the A.I. It start to differ from AoE however, in the content category. It spans the entire time humans have been on earth instead of the middle ages, it has air units, nuclear weapons, advanced battleships,  big freakin' Tiger tanks, you name it. I simply cant reccomend Age of Empires II HD over this game, it just has more content. as for how it looks, its not amazing, but you have to expect that, as this game was originally from '03, and got remastered. It's not NEXT GEN ULTRA PHOTOREALISTIC, its more EARLY 21st CENTURY POLYGONAL GRAPHICS.The A.I. isnt as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as it is in other RTSs either, its actually a challenge on hard.This game also has a ""Conquer the World"" gametype, that fused the RTS elements with some turn-based gameplay, similar to Total War games. Its cool, but the turn-based gameplay needs polish.Overall, I can see why it was GOTY 2003, great game.9/10"

It introduced me to the RTS genre, and in my eyes remains superior to many modern titles. The game has great replayability, honestly hasn't gotten old for me yet (and I've had it since 2006).Additionally, there's a relatively lively modding community for a title that was originally released in 2001.Still, even though the game’s a classic, it’s not perfect. The in game diplomacy system needs to be reworked. For example, if you start on a team with an AI player and the victory condition is conquest of everybody else, you can expect them to betray you. This will happen especially if you are doing exponentially better than every other player (or if they’re the one who’s doing much better), despite the fact that they win if you’re team wins.

The tutorials give a good overlook of how to play the game and even made me feel multiplayer ready. Of course, I was destroyed online but still enjoyed the experience. There's a lot of similarity to games like Civ here as well due to progression starting from early in time to the modern day. Despite covering such a hefty amount of history, a full match won't take you 12+ hours like a standard game of Civ but it's not as fast as SC2 and it's latest expansion LoTV.

OVERALL I don't particularly enjoy the game because of ""The bad and the ugly"" listed below, which kill the fun for me. Lots of customization of options relating to the game, butThe Good:It holds up okay in some respects still, despite being very old. The economy system is pretty good and for me is by far the most fun aspect of the game. It has a lot of good functions such as hotkeys for every building, finding your army, finding idle workers, and of course the numbers can be hotkeyed to whatever you want such as all of your barracks on 6 for example so you can quickly create whatever units you want. There are also a wide range of nations with varied nation powers, strengths and weaknesses. There are spoken commands/taunts depending on what you type, from 0 - 100 typing just a number will trigger a sound file to be played. This can be fun and even helpful, though I just used voice chat to communicate with the friends I played the game with. The game lobby is pretty good, you can set a wide range of variables there, such as starting age, ending age (if you only want to play the game up to the medieval period you can do soThe Bad: The music is unbearably loud and your only solution is to check the box which turns the music off. Even moving the volume slider to its lowest will not help for long, the volume resets itself at seemingly random times. The combat sucks....Despite the large variety of army units every game I've played has lasted around 50-75 minutes and always ends up at the information age and nukes galore. You can have a large advantage over a computer player and still not be able to kill their forces quickly despite overwhelming army forces. It can be very frustrating especially when you're an age ahead. For example massing main battle tanks should be able to kill most groups of lower tier enemies with ease, but can struggle (especially with..;)The Ugly: The pathing in the game is pretty attrocious. Your units if near a border will run headlong into battle chasing enemies until they themselves are killed, or you tell them to come back (they will immediately run back again unless you hit the stop command, which can get them killed easily by siege weapons if you're not careful, since after telling them to stop they will not move unless told to. It's a mixed blessing that the command is there). Your units will also bunch up if you have many of the same type, they'll have to go around the forests and can sometimes split your army very disadvantageously for you if you're not careful with clicking the minimap. If you're attacked, it can be very difficult to move the few civilians who are in danger because if you try to draw a box to select them, you'll prioritize your army and thus be unable to select the civs. If you double click the civ, it will select all civs on your screen (when usually you want the majority of them to continue what they were doing). The game is also a huge time sink, as you can be in a game for an hour long but essentially lose it 30 mins into it without knowing, but you think you still may have a chance so you stay in a little longer, and longer....It's one of those games that I play a few matches every now and then and have fun until the battles happen, because the combat system in this game is quite bad, which is a shame because everything else is quite well thought out in my opinion. I flip-flopped a few times between recommended and not recommended, but ended up choosing ""not"" because the game is actually very expensive when not on sale ($25+ CAD), and overall I'd probably have given it a 55/100 to begin with, for reasons stated above"

Even Grey Goo, which is a great game, is limited to 2v2 or smaller on strict maps to get into the MLG scene; it's just the way the industry is going. So I went through lists of every RTS, most of which I've played, and stumbled across this gem.  I can't believe I've never played Rise of Nations before!!RoN is like an awesome blend of Age of Empires, Civilization V, and Supreme Commander 2 (all my favorite RTSs [ok, Civ V is a TBS]).In RoN you have unlimited resources, and with territory control and attrition damage defensive players are rewarded, so you can get some awesomely epic games going.  This game was made back before ""matches"" were meant to last less than 30 minutes to keep the ""spectators"" from getting bored.  It's a true RTS, and a classic game I'm ashamed I've never even heard of before recently.I can't comment on the multiplayer connectivity since I've had limited experience with it so far.

Especially given it is a revamped HD version of a game that came out a decade ago.I recommend this game if you're okay with1) sticking to playing against AI for a long, long time2) enjoy getting stomped online very easily3) okay with playing a revamped game from a decade ago and willing to learn its high learning curveThe game truly is a blast from the past, if its on sale and you have friends willing to play with you I think you'll have some real fun with it as its a very cheap $4.99 on sale. I still think civ v is much more worth it and when civ v is on sale its $12.00 for the vanilla game and all the DLC. I know comparing strategy games to civ v is sacrelligous but it had to be said!"

If you never played Rise of Nations, and you like RTS games, then you absolutely need to pick this up.First, remember it's a remaster of a game that, like I said, is 10 years old, so don't pick it up expecting it to look like Starcraft II.  The textures were updated to look like they did when the game first came out, but with today's higher resolutions, so they're not blocky, but you can't see the facial expressions on your citizens either.With standard settings, you start off in what's basically the stone age.  You have a small town, you can gather food and wood, but little else.  With some basic research, you're off and running into the Classical Age, where you can start getting better buildings, mine metal, have your scholars conduct research, and start building your army.Research takes you across eight ages, finally leaving you in the Information Age, complete with fighters, bombers, cruise and nuclear missiles, Space Programs, and Supercolliders.  If you've played Empire Earth, you should feel right at home.It's definitely one of my favorite, if not my favorite RTS games of all time.  My biggest gripe is the population cap is limited to 200, or 250 if you have certain wonders.  For $20 I don't think you can go wrong with this, but if it's on sale and you're an RTS person, you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you take a pass on this one.Just as a caveat to my review, though, I have only played this singleplayer, and that probably won't change unless I get some friends into it, so if multiplayer is your aim, might want to check the forums and see if they've patched out the ""bugs.""  I put it in quotes because I haven't seen any, nor have a lot of people, but just be aware that there are supposedly a few at tht time of this writing."

I have mixed feelings about this. Although I love these games and the re-releases are good the prices have been an issue. I don't feel that $30/40 is fair for these games, and they are on the right path by decreasing the price of RoN to $15 pre-release and $20 on release, which would be a fair price for other re-releases such as Age of Mythology and AoE 2. Now to the game itself.Rise of Nations is one of, if not my favorite RTS game of all time. It blends various game concepts from games such as Civilization and Age of Empires and makes a masterpiece. This game is HEAVILY micro-management centric, where the nation with the greatest economic output, and the player who can manage that economic output efficiently, is going to win. Resources on the map are infinite, however productivity is everything, managing exactly how many woodcutting camps you need to sustain your growth without sacrificing, say mining metal for example. The combat in this game is also well balanced, focusing on a good mix of units rather than unit spam. Unique units are brought to the table just like in Civilization that each Nation has that can give them a slight advantage, however every unit always has a counter or way to be defeated. There's no ""stacks of death"" or ""zerg rush"" in this game, and that is one reason I also like it. I've been the smaller nation holding off spams of cheap units from bigger nations sucessfully many times. I wish more modern RTS games existed like this....I could only imagine the cores of this game being molded into a modern RTS...it would be grand.10/10"

This game is the perfect older strategy game that blends combat and resource gathering without too much micromanagement. Simply put, You are not building 1000 farms and moving citizens around while you are in combat. The AI is still fairly strong. With lots of options, this game offers a lot of choices and interesting mechanics.Go from early ages to the near future and explore different types of combat options. From tanks to cavalry, you will experience dramatically different types of combat during each stage of the match. You can play early age only matches and enjoy some medieval combat or go go to the modern ages warring with nuclear arms. Protecting your cities will help, but wonders are your key buildings and keeping them standing will get you advance fighters much faster. Imagine how tense it can be when you are researching Nuclear Shield hoping that no one is going to nuke your wonders as a parting gift.With tons of modes, a very unique and great campaign, great game play, and a decent soundtrack, this game is definitely worth the purchase.This game is so much fun. Rise of Nations has nice HD, rarely ever crashes, runs smoothly and all around impresses me. Online is even much better than I expected. The lobby is especially helpful when looking for a game. My one and only gripe with the HD reboot stems with the online however. The problem is that no one is playing this game online. I occasionally see a game going but I can never get into a match or stay in one without half the players dropping at start. If you are thinking about getting this game for solo or local game play, you should. It has so much to offer. You will enjoy every second of it. But if you are expecting great online strategy battles,you might want to look elsewhere. As much as I hope that the online portion of this game will pick up, I don't see it happening anytime soon. Until this game gets more players, I am sticking to solo and local area net."

Has loads of nations and plenty of units so it's interesting to keep looking around. Plenty of random types of maps as well, conquer the world mode which is very basic but good for wasting time.

Yet only by playing for a handful of hours I can see that this is the game for me and the best RTS I have ever experienced.I mean, it has everything good from other RTS games and perfects them: the region system from EE2 and it's advancement from tribes to massive civilizations being a huge factor, in fact I'd say much of this game is in the stride of EE2 even though it was released 3 years before EE2. I love how buildings increase in price as you build more of them and how worker units go about their tasks automatically and that other nations aren't so focussed on military progress, as I rarely stray from an economic path, so when the AI see that I have no army they don't invade, they just remark on how they hope for a peaceful relationship with me. I love it!!And not since something like Civilization V have I feared nuclear warfare more, they truely do warm my cold, calculating heart with devastating beauty like nothing I've witnessed before.The only downside for me is the lack of constructing walls; generally I prefer being an isolationist, hence the focus on economy over military, but other than that I can find very little fault in the game, it is absolutely fantastic and has been expertly remastered for a new age in gaming. And the Steam Workshop is just icing on the cake.This is a masterpiece, nothing less. 10/10."

,Recommended,287450,13029013,"Posted: 21 November, 2014",all,Sutalffa,"I haven't played this much on multiplayer, but I know the singleplayer experience is great after playing it years ago everyday after school for months on end.A) The game has a PAUSE button. No more clickfests in a real time STRATEGY game!  That means if the enemy catches you off guard, you can simply pause the game, build units in all your production buildings, wait a minute or two, and then you have an army to fight with... assuming you have the resources to support it and can afford the ramped unit costs.B) The game has interesting assassination and diplomacy modes, so freeforall matches don't end up in the computer players secretly ganging up on you.C) You can quota research as well as simply ""tab"" through open research buildings.D) You don't ""gather resources"".  Instead, you just assign workers to resource gathering buildings, and they increase your income.E) The Conquer the World mode is similar to the ""Empire"" series in that you can upgrade territories and support attacks with multiple armies into single territories.  There's also an alliance system and you have to declare war to invade not to mention the presence of unique resources which help too.F) The game is similar to Civ with 8 ages, updated (not upgraded) units, and technologies that actually improve your performance instead of just unlocking stuff.  There are also Wonders of the World, and cities get bigger over time with improvements.  Conquering cities does not destroy improvements either unless you manually target them before conquest, and cities must have all improvements manually razed after they're annexed before the city itself can be razed.G) Attrition damage prevents enemies from slipping into your land without supply wagons backing them up.  The French also get supply wagons that heal in enemy land.H) You can garrison units in production buildings to heal them instead of having to build castles or towers too (although you can still build them).I) Focus fire REDUCES damage dealt to enemy units. When you attack an enemy force, just attack-move.  Micromanagement actually HURTS your performance.  This is a STRATEGY game, not a first person shooter.J) Dragoons and Carabineers for the win!  Never fear pikemen or fusiliers again when charging enemy artillery before the industrial age.K) Markets don't remain stagnant or solely depend on players buying and selling resources.  They float around and stabilize over time.  You can use trade routes too for wealth, and the Dutch have a cool ability that earns interest on saved resources.  You can actually play the late game without any economy at all as the Dutch as long as you don't spend everything you have.  That helps your population limit.  :-PL) Spies, commandos, and generals are incredible force multipliers.  They can bribe, assassinate, dig-in, force march, create decoys, and ambush enemy forces.M) The historical Conquer the World campaigns actually have interesting battle setups.  For example, fighting for the Korean Peninsula during the Cold War actually starts with a DMZ as well as the Russians (and maybe Chinese) sending help for the north as well as the Americans headquartered in Japan.  It doesn't just plunk a bunch of cities down on somewhat sculpted terrain.  Likewise, the Americans start allied with the British against the French and Iroquois in the Colonial Campaign, but they pay tribute until declaring independence.N) There are INFINITE unit production quotas.  That means you don't have to periodically check on a production building to see if it's still building reinforcements while you're commanding an army on the front.O) Generals AUTOMATICALLY group with combined selected military units.  When you click the ""next general"" button, the WHOLE army will be automatically selected.P) Units can cross water on their own in default transport ships.  You don't need to build transports for them, but they are very vulnerable and need to be escorted.  Otherwise, a squad of destroyers or sloops can wipe out an entire expedition.  The same thing goes for naval trade routes which can be plundered for wealth.Q) You can ADJUST research times and costs under game settings.  Play a fast and cheap game if you don't want to spend much on research or wait around, or play a slow and expensive game if you want something more drawn out.  You can also play a sandbox game to experiment with building strategies, or play a pacifist game with a score limit.R) Capital defeat depends on losing one's capital and not recovering it for a period of time.  That means you don't have to destroy every little thing on the map to win.  You just have to conquer your enemies' capitals and hold them for so long.S) Territory victory doesn't mean controlling the entire map.  In fact, you can reduce the percent of land needed for victory to BELOW HALF of the map if you want players to play more according to balance of powers or if you want an easier time where you can say, ""Yea, I've effectively won already.  There's no need to rinse and repeat.""  This really helps with population limits too since a single player with only 200 units can't beat multiple players with 200 units each.  That said, you can still ally with someone in diplomacy mode to combine your land percentages.T) You can win with Wonders of the World as long as you have more ""points"" in Wonders than anyone else and hold them long enough.  This is similar to the tourism victory in Civ 5's Brave New World expansion where you need enough influence built up over other civilizations over time.U) Airplanes have a flight radius.  You can't fly them everywhere over the map unless you build an airport to move them to.  Cruise missiles and nuclear missiles work the same way with missile silos.V) Unit costs change over time.  For example, when you discover oil, heavy cavalry will no longer cost wealth, but cost oil instead.W) Land itself gives you wealth.  A bigger empire is a wealthier empire, and you get more wealth with research in the temple which also expands your borders and gives cities more health.X) All maps don't have equal resources available, and that actually changes gameplay tactics.  A map without hills is a map without metal, so don't expect many heavy units on it.  There's probably going to be a lot of light cavalry instead which just cost food and wood (since light cavalry defeat light infantry and ranged cavalry which cost food and wood or food and wealth respectively). In turn, defensive players research civics to increase attrition damage (especially the Russians) as well as push their borders to make it harder to be harassed.  Offensive players will target enemy caravans between cities and try to destroy temples since civics boosts wealth as well.Y) Custom governments exist in the game, and actually make a big difference.  Republic, democracy, and capitalism tend to support defensive economic strategies.  Despotism, monarchy, and socialism tend to support offensive military strategies.Z) Workers that repair buildings under attack get hurt, and can eventually die.  If you're bombarding an enemy structure that's repaired, don't worry about being in vain.  Also, repairing gets slowed down if a worker is hit and accelerates if uninterrupted.As you can see, this game has a ton to offer.  There are also tons of custom scenarios to download with triggers and customized units (such as fusiliers transforming into carabineers to represent dismounted cavalry or special force commandos transforming into assault infantry to represent sniper versus assault rifles if you hit an action key, or man of war ships with a range of 30 to represent gunpowder naval bombardment during land battles whereas the regular game gives man of war a range of... 11 if I remember correctly to represent fighting in naval battles.  You use bomb ketches instead to ordinarily bombard cities inland)."

Each of your cities has a radius around it that constitutes your national border. You can build other buildings only within your borders, and you can build only a limited number of different improvements for each city (such as a maximum of five farms each). Since expanding your empire depends entirely on your cities, the game makes you think harder about how and where you should expand. This focus on cities also means that each one will become a distinct community, with its own farms, temples, universities, and so on--actual cities will populate your empire, unlike in other real-time strategy games, where most of your structures are at your main base, while your additional town halls exist in isolation near some resources."

It plays like an RTS version of Civ 2, which is still my favorite version of Civ. It's amazing that 11 years later there is still not an RTS that is as well designed and fun to play as this game. This game lets you advance through all the ages of human history like Civ, but gives you the fast pace of realtime matches. For those who prefer to play turn-based, you can pause at any time in solo or setup online matches with free pauses. If you are looking for a fun campaign jump straight to Conquer the World and play the Entire World map.There are some minor bugs at launch (no sound after alt-tabbing in fullscreen mode, unable to uncheck and save fullscreen option, delays connecting to lobbies with no indication you are connecting, lobbies aren't autoupdating), but they are not enough to hinder enjoying the game and will most likely be resolved in a patch. Some people in the forums have reported issues launching the game, but none of my friends or myself have experienced this and we have spent several hours playing multiplayer.Being able to play this with friends through Steamworks has been a blast, and at $20 it's practically a steal.

I would recommend to buy it for people who do not own RoN yet, as well to people who would love to participate in multiplayer. Hopefully the EOL system will successfully kick in and the amount of players doing PvP increases.There are some bugs introduced with this version of the game, but it seems that currently they are fixing them, silently (for example the ALT + Tab sound problem seems to be fixed). Multiplayer crashes from time to time, making the game also crash/close. Single player seems to be working well, at least I have not gotten any problems with that (true, I mostly do multiplayer/quick matches).Overall a recommended buy for RTS fans."

The AI was fairly weak, one of the few games even I could master against even the hardest AI levels without too much trouble.  I had been excited since hearing about the Extended Edition with updated graphics ...... unfortunately, that excitement has lead to a bit of disappointment.  I honestly can't notice much of a graphics improvement over the original RoN, with the exception of unit turn and movement animations being just a little smoother.  The intro cinematic has definitely not improved one iota of graphical fidelity and they stretch from their original 4:3 to fill your monitor width (very noticeable disproportion on a modern widescreen monitor such as a 1920x1080 as I have), and the game runs slow with laggy and outright glitchy mouse controls (hovering a mouse over certain buildings will cause the mouse pointer to flicker badly between the appropriate contextual mouse pointer and the regular game pointer, for instance).  There are a couple new features, such as in-game Twitch Streaming support (its an option on the main menu -- awkwardly, the mouseover for Twitch Streaming contains a typo).I haven't yet tried to use old mods such as the popular DonTheDime's CTW campaign expansion, but I imagine they will sadly no longer work ... I hope it won't be long before we see good mods to the game for the Extended Edition.Overall, I'd said wait and see whether the bugs glitches unique to the Extended Edition are addressed, and hopefully some optimizations.  If you still have the original and have figured out how to run it at modern resolutions (google for help with this), for now I recommend doing so rather than jumping to the Extended Edition, as whatever graphics enhancements are present (again, I don't see much, except when zoomed in, and I generally play zoomed out) I don't think make up for the current glitches and slowdowns."

That's what this game is, you research tech and build unique structures, but it basically is a RTS version of Civ. And I freaking love it. I played this game religiously as a kid, an now that I've come back, it's even better. More Nations, more units, more single player stuff, everything had been made better. Since war and alliances are the only option (A difference from Civ), the main stratagy comes from building more powerful cities, researching tech's at different times, and building a varied army from a wide selection of units. Everythings strong against something and weak against something else, but racial bonuses make some ventures more worthwhile. Do you build all melee and just overwhelm them? Or do you make an entire battalion of ranged units and kill them before they get close? And now, with an advanced Conquer the World campaign (Basically a game of risk with detailed combat) which includes awesome, unique scenarios, this game has wedged itself back into my heart, and my schedule."

Border push, wonders and diminishing returns (each unit/building of a given type costs more than the last) keep things lively and elimiate a lot of generic RTS spam strategies. Vistory can come from annihilation of the enemy, domination of the map area, or by building a majority of the wonders. Although essentially symetric, the numerous civilizations all have a healthy set of tweaks, bonues and 'unique' units (age specific upgrades to the vanilla units) so that you get a wide variety of playstyles and methods to victory.

,Recommended,287450,12205935,"Posted: 23 September, 2014",all,Ravenblade,"Rise of Nations has been one of my favourite RTS franchises of the past and I am pretty happy to see a modern makeover of it with a fair pricing tag attached to it.My favourite gameplay mode is Conquer the World also called CtW. It combines Risk-like gameplay during grand-strategical phase while providing a unique RTS experience ""on ground"" when the actual fight for a territory happens.During the RTS phase you are able to progress one age further than that of the world's phase offering a different style of gameplay for each of the 24 nations as the world goes through different ages starting with the Ancient Age where units die fast but come cheap to the fast-paced Information Age filled with danger and nuclear excitement.Instead of building traditional bases players build towns which can be expanded with buildings providing specialized civilian units such as the caravan, the merchant for controlling and mining unique resources, as well as buildings specialized for the economic needs and strengths of the area around the town starting with their regional capital. Each town may also expand national borders which can then be fortified by manned or unmanned towers and fortresses. In short the economical side of the game is very fleshed out and has an amazing depth.The fierce fighting against an AI which is still ahead of most if not all RTS AIs I have had the pleasure to play against.The choice of units is not huge even with the unique units aside it's down to three types of infantry units per age, 2-3 cavalry/mechanized units, and one type siege and supply unit each and 4 kinds of military ships.  This is not counting special units like scout units, generals and yes, spies which do spy-ey things, fishing boats and transports. However the difference is that with each major age they get upgraded to a different type of unit also shifting their roles and importance.The game includes the addon Thrones and Patriots which adds government, all the remaining civs and wonders (only actively buildable in skirmish and coop but may appear as regional feature on world map still).Overall a recommendable game for those who want a different RTS experience and take a break from all that MOBA gaming."

Very similar to Age of Empires only on a larger scale with a bit more of a complex resource gathering system.You can pick a civilization, each with bonus's to different aspects of the game that give them and edge over others. Example: Spain has already fully explored the map, Japanese get bonus to gathering fish and so on.Then you build cities that expand your borders. You can only collect resources that are within your borders as well as constructing other buildings. Units do counter each other like, spearmen are good agaisnt horsemen, archers against spearmen and javalin are good against archers. However, when you advance in the ages, horses and bows are redundant when you have guns and tanks.Nukes are also a thing in this. They're pretty fun but, have a ""how many times"" counter after the first one in the match sets off. You and everyone else can only launch so many nukes before game over and everyone loses.Very neat little RTS. I'd say if you're a fan of Age of Empires or RTS at all then give this gem a shot. It's worth it!"

,Not Recommended,287450,30281698,Posted: 2 March,all,targetmaster,Although my views of this game are mixed if forced to pick one over the other I would say: I DO NOT reccomend this game.Originally I was looking for an RTS in the Modern Era that had resource development potential and a city builder like premise. Something close to AOE2 or AOM(EE) etc...This game comes very close. So close. But yet no cigar. It fails for the following reasons.- Depreciation on the units' health in enemy territory correctly happens; but is TOO extreme.- Poor AI. Unambitious on easy. Impossible on Hard.- Difficulties are adjusted by giving resource advantage to you or the computer respectively.  Not adjusted on AI skill.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Random Maps.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Graphics.- Barebones Diplomacy.- Lack of Defensive Play Option.- Units automatically change from land unit to sea unit which is completely unrealistic.- For territory victory games land owned by computer player is completely over estimated adding unecessarily to depreciation.- Like all RTS Games the ability for the computer to do more than one thing at once over powers the human player too greatly. This happens even with speed adjustment.- Boring music.While as someone who grew up with AOE2 I appreciated being able to play with modern units these structural errors in game play were too great to compensate for the flaws mentioned above.If you still really want to play it buy it in a sale like I did.

So why the negative review?  Read on to know.Multiplayer reviewThe ron community is more toxic now than it ever was.  I started by playing standard games and I ended up playing mostly rushers and/or raiders.  So I switched to playing no rush and I ended up playing mostly smotherers.  Yes the ron community wasn't perfect back in 2005 to 2007(approx.)(you could even say far from it probably) but it wasn't nearly as bad as this.  Mulitiplayer is where this game should really be shining.  If you can handle this environment then go for it.  If not wait for a sale because you might end up playing single player like me.Other things-never play against anyone called the diplomat-the conquer the world campaigns are a complete waste of time and probably even worse in my opinion.

Sadly, I was disappointed. Rise of Nations adds many new features that expand on the work started by its spiritual predecessor, the Age of Empires series, but sadly fails to create enough variety in gameplay to keep things interesting for long. Units die quickly and have annoyingly stupid behavior that makes them difficult to control, so combat lacks strategic finesse and usually relies on constantly building more units. This seems like this would require skills in economic micromanagement, but the economy is also overly simple and automated, so no part of the gameplay really carries much excitement. The civilizations are all generally the same, so the game gets old fast.Fans of the original Age of Empires series are better off with superior titles like Age of Mythology or Age of Empires 3 with all the expansions, which both offer more replayability and strategic depth. RoN's saving grace is its campaign maps, but games like Total War and Dawn of War have similar features with better combat to mix things up."

When I saw this on sale I was pretty excited for a trip down nostolgia lane. But unfortunately this thing has not aged well, and it has revealed that it isn't a game so much as an chore to be optimized.Its overly complex in what you need to keep track of, you need to simultaneously be researching key technology at a library while expanding new cities, keeping your military updated with the newest weaponry, building resource-efficiency buildings, researching efficiency upgrades at said buildings, building new workers, building a military to begin with, and expanding your commerce with trading with your other cities. This isn't even taking into account the building of wonders or tactical combat, or the specialization of what troops to build in what quantities.It's a massive headache to play, even on easy difficulties. And even when you win, it's unsatisfying. In my most previous game, I ended up building wonders to boost my empire, and appearently that starts a timer which at the end of you just straight up win. And then you're back to the main menu. Now I know you can probably turn that off as a setting, but the anti-climactic end to about 45 minutes of pretty intense micromanagement of a realtime empire is frustrating.It's just too complex. Too much. I recognize that the individual features of the game are probably solid, but its inpenetrable. I do like other turn-based strategy games like StarCraft II, Civilization, and Age of Wonders 3, so its not the genre, but this particular realtime strategy game is getting a pass from me."

All of a sudden the game quite loading in early or mid-March, much to my disappointment.   I cannot afford to upgrade my computer or its graphics, and thus am unable to play the game.  If this is a Microsoft problem whereby updates have rendered my computer essentially useless for playing the game-----TOO BAD. SO LONG.   ADIOS FOOL!"

The movements of people (villagers, warriors, horses - all units) in the game are very slow and not smooth. The units and villagers in particular cannot even walk on the paths through buildings.... but they have to walk ALL the way around the buildings to get to the other side. The fighting animations are dreadful. I personally  think age of Empires is better. This game was decent maybe 7 years ago when it first game out. Although being just as old, age of empires has got better graphics to my perspective. I wish i could get a refund as i could have got something a lot better for 20 dollars.

Half an hour in, when the nukes start flying and enemy tanks are rolling through your base, there isn't enough time to do a fraction of what you want.The graphics are a little dated, but you'll be having far too much fun to even notice.

Given the Civ formula is super popular as it is with Civ 5 as proved by the amount of people playing. I think this RTS needs to have a closer look based on that alone. It's for people who want gratification in an hour or two of playing time. The gratification payoff for a game like Civ 5 forces someone to invest way too much into the game before becoming too numb brained to be gratified. This has a sleek system - cool time periods covered.  - It has a take on 4 relevant time periods. I suppose its 'old.' But I think this is the best game ever made. It's what a video game should be in my opinion. If you want to understand the intangibles of what makes this system so great and so rewarding. Put down some money and see for yourself. I reccomend buying the strategy guide as knowing a little about the system will engage and reward single player experiences. It's a neat algorithm. Chess, at the end of the day is just an algorithm. People fell in love with it and they believe it is the intelligent man's/ strategy gaming man's Eden. I vote for The Eden of Rise of Nations.

It added depth when other strategy games of the time simply expected you to wreck enemy cities like you're leading a Mongol horde.Conquer the World mode is the star of the show for me. Again, as above, having one global map forces the player to think strategically, unlike most games of its time where you just went from one scenario to another with one battle having no consequence on the other. You need to win the right places at the right time or you will expose yourself to enemy attacks that will take large chunks out of your empire. The campaign battles themselves aren't really big on variety, but there's enough of it to make you return to each campaign to see if you can beat the AI more quickly.Multiplayer is also lots of fun and it's quite a challenge if the AI is set at a higher difficulty.Overall, highly recommended.

The gameplay is the same as it always has been and amazingly, no game has tried such a brilliant concept since.  I highly recommend this game to fans of the Civ and AoE series and RTS's in general.  If you're a newcomer to the RTS genre, I would recommend starting with more basic games such as Starcraft or Age of Empires II.5 Stars."

I kept up with the modding community atron.heavengames.com(not sure if it still exists). I recently started playing Civilization V because it featured many of the same aspects. I was hesitent because of the turn-based gameplay, but I ended up loving the game. So to my surprise, I saw that this game was on Steam slightly re-worked. I instantly bought it and downloaded it. When I started playing, I realized that I didn't lose any of my ability in those three years and that real time strategy is way better than turn-based.TL;DR: A must-buy. RTS>Turn-based"

I remember playing this back when it first came out and when I found that it was revived I simply had to buy it. Sure, it may have been around for a while and it is an older game but this one has an authentic feel to it. There have been others who have attempted the whole ""Advance through the ages"" thing but this one by far is the easiet one to get into. Empire Earth was great also but I like this so much better. This isn't your standard Starcraft or Warcraft, though, the core elements are identical but you get to amass larger armies and march on the gates of your enemies with a bunch of units and siege weapons to make the taking of their lands easier on you. This game does offer plenty of challenge to the seasoned RTS veteran and lots of fun for those looking for a semi-casual experience.If you are a Real Time Strategy fan, and you are looking to expand your library of RTS games, I would reccommend scooping this one up."

You are developing your civilisation through times, from Ancient to Information Age. The game lets you to balance between the troop, economy and civic. You are also allowed to build a Wonder (basically the same for a game of this kind.)I was playing the Chinese against 4 AIs and became a foe to my neigbour, the Japanese who constantly attacked me and then tried to propose peace many times. I had some basic idea that this would be accepted to diplomacy, but couldn't find the tap until realise that it's in the lower-right corner -- after a long while. As history goes, peace is not long. All the AIs formed their alliance, for the record, led by the Korean, kept saying they wouldn't let this arrogant live and attacked me from every direction.

However, there are some flaws that need brushing out:- AI might be a bit flawed based on when to pull back upon player's discretion. Basically some units don't draw back even though I directed them away from combat.- Screen tends to go blank for some unexplained reason during the tutorials, as well as the fact that it kind of just crashes my graphics card's drivers. I don't know why this is happening, but it really shouldn't, as my GPU is very reliable and it barely stays any warmer than 40 - 50 degrees Celsius.EDIT: It crashes regardless of what mode I choose. This should not be happening, regardless of what my hardware specs are.EDIT 2: It crashes to desktop after playing the game for a while, as my operating system points to my graphics drivers as the problem, which shouldn't be. This is just ridiculous, Skybox. Fix it! I cannot play a game that has to constantly crash no matter what I do.- When the narrator mispronounces ""Britain"" as ""Brighton"" and then proceeds to correctly pronounce it on the next tutorial scenario. This isn't Skybox's fault, but Big Games had this completely messed up and it sincerely bothered *and* confused me, because either way: ""Britons"" and ""Britains"" are pronounced just about the same way as ""brit-AN"".Otherwise, I can say it's a pretty good game, and I recommend it for anyone that wants to give it a shot."

,Recommended,287450,11505184,"Posted: 1 August, 2014",all,the Unusual Gamer,"Thank you Good Game.Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.Thank you for reminding me why I wanted a demo of this game just over a decade ago.Two of my absolute favorite franchises are fused together in this fantastic rendition of the old classic; Rise of Nations. When you put the marco-management of cities and a commercial system you get in the Civilization series with the action and structure found in much of the Age of Empires series, this game is the result; the game is such an incredible experience that I feel I could play as much as Civilization V right now, and at this point I've racked up over 1000 hours on CiV. For me the game is the best of both worlds.Even though I'm largely no good at the game I'm a big fanboy of Civilization, me and my siblings have followed the game since the very first. At first it was a pursuit to victory but as I grew up and at around the third game a strange thing happened to me; while just about every other genuine gamer would go 'Cool. I'll pick Genghis Khan. He looks cool.', I actually started to ask 'Who's he? Why's he here?' I began to take a real interest in history. To me then Civilization holds a truey massive place in my heart as both an excellent game - which in the last few years seem to be exploring a new world in what a Civilization game really is, and as an agent of who I would become - my interest in global history started with a LAN game of Civilization III with my mates in high school, and it hasn't stopped. Now I've gone full circle, working as a civilopedia writer for the More Civilizations team of modders, I now get to completely indulge in my constant interest in world history and in an albeit small part contributing to the community.Why am I rambling about Civ? Oh yea! For a real time strategy this game has a surprizing amount of content that seems to be influenced by Civilization. Firstly is the sheer size of playable nations - you have a chioce of 24. 24!!!!! Not even Age of Empires III: the Asian Dynasties have this many different nations playable in total. 24 is a very large number, it's larger than the catalogue of Civilization II civs. Then when you start you begin with a capital at the ability to build city buildings, when I first play this years ago the very idea of cities in RTS was so weird and cool and awesome I remember immediately wanting to pick the game up and being much too young to get to myself. Yea, that's me. I'm a guy who likes a gimmick or two. Then there's the trade system which bares only a slight similarity to Civ; you connect two cities to a trade route by building a caravan from your market and tell it to go to a city that's elsewhere from the market's city. Lastly, one final CIv-inspried concept are resources and to an extent how you use resources, similar to Civilization resources found in your borders add to your yields and you can improve them with a merchant to gain a special bonus attached to the resource. And you know what? I think Sid Meier, creator of Civilization, must have been inspired by Rise of Nations. How else do you explain embarking in Civ5? Rise of Nations has the same idea, when you reach an early tech your units can turn into a transport seacraft and carry on across the water. Niffty!When it comes to Age of Empires, naturally Rise of Nations comes out trumps taking on............more or less everything; units, buildings, wonders...........being an RTS.............well, think RTS and that's what Rise of Nations has. It's hard really to sum up the Age of Empires influence in an RTS game with a historic context, primarily because Age of Empires IS an RTS game with a historical context. For the moment let's just say that Rise of Nations is Age of Empires, better. Much better.I've been working on a tribute review for Age of Empires and Esemble Studios, the original developers of the series, and I've tended to compare the evolution of the games to the evolution of the modern supercar; Age of Empires original as the Lamborghini Miura, Age of Kings as the Porsche 911 GT3 RS, Age of Mythology as the McLaren F1, the New World as the Bugatti Veyron, and Age of Empires Online as.........how can I put it?...........a Bugatti Veyron, slamming into a wall. If I could describe Rise of Nations as a car, I fell the Lamborghni Aventador might suit best; it's not the most pretty thing in the world, but it goes like a bugger!And on that bombshell, it is time to end. Thank you so much for watching. Good night!...>><<What just happened?"

I bought the game back when it launched, put hundreds of hours into it, and still love it today.  The replayability is infinite because every game is unique.  Even with the same game settings, the AI's will build and attack differently each time.  If you are up for a serious challenge, play a few games online.There are many different nations you can choose from, and each one has its own set of exlusive benifits.  For example, the Americans can build their first wonder instantly (with the exclusion of Space Program and Supercollider), and the Chinese get instant citizen spawning and instant large cities.  Those are just a couple of examples.As you progress and gather resources, you can research newer technologies.  In the beginning, your nation can learn how to read and write, or learn how to barter.  As you unlock researches, you will be able to progress to a new age, which unlocks a wealth of new buildings and units you can use.  The technologies range all the way from basic reading and writing all the way up to Artificial Intelligence.  Start in the Archaic Age, and end in the Information Age.  As you play this game, it may just teach you a little bit of history (especially if you play the campaigns)!Many (if not all) of the Wonders in the game are based on real life historical buildings, such as the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, the Colliseum, the Pyramids, and Taj Mahal.The singleplayer campaign is quite good as well.  There are multiple campaigns you can play, such as the Cold War, Alexander the Great, and Conquer the World.I found hundreds of hours of gameplay here.  I definitely recommend you give this game a try!  If you are a fan of RTS games, you will love this game!9/10"

,Recommended,287450,20422948,"Posted: 9 January, 2016",all,MHLoppy,"Not gonna talk about the gameplay itself other to say I played both vanilla and then later Thrones and Patriots before the Extended Edition and that I really enjoy(ed) both.The Extended Edition has a number or improvements that I appreciated as a >100 hours player:+ Much smoother animations (I highly recommend you watch gameplay - it's noticeable within seconds of playing and was especially noticeable during projectile-heavy combat with arrows and siege weapons).+ Anti-aliasing, which helps a lot since there are a lot of small visual details which were previously quite badly aliased.+ Improved multiplayer / online matchmaking etc.+ Improved support for modern systems (although I recall having minimal issues on Windows 8.1 with my old version).A few neutral points:~ New backgrounds in menus. I miss the old ones, but do understand that they were pretty low res and generally don't look that nice on newer systems.~ There are Steam achievements in the Extended Edition, but they're very generic and I don't feel like they add to the game in a meaningful way. I guess some people might appreciate them though.~ Textures are supposed to be better but I can't really tell tbh. Counterpoint is that at least nothing looks different from what I'm used to, which is good.~ Water is supposedly improved but I personally don't like the updated water that much. It's not /bad/ per se, I'm just not convinced it's an improvement over the original water in any way but technical. To me it feels like the updated water makes it harder to distinguish the boundary of Fog of War, but it's not a big deal.~ There don't seem to be many good Workshop mods for the game as of Jan 2016. There's a few decent ones but nothing that I saw that made me think ""damn that sounds really good, I'll definitely download that"". Most of the 4-star mods are just pop-cap increases, which can make things messy balance-wise so aren't necessarily desirable (unlike something like TA where the original amount was quite constrictive).~ Despite there being a DVD release of the RoN soundtrack, the Extended Edition still uses the original ADPCM 178kbps 22,050 KHz tracks. While the music itself is great, it's a real shame that the higher quality tracks were not put to use in this version of the game. (Thrones and Patriots tracks were released in higher quality to begin with)~ There are some bugs not related to hardware or OS that I experienced occasionally in the original that may or may not be present in the Extended Edition. I haven't seen it said that they were explicitly fixed, but I've yet to experience them. (e.g. silos sometimes bug out and ""fail"" their missile launches, causing missiles to simply fly up and then disappear against non-missile-shielded targets)And unfortunately there's a few negatives:- Widely-experienced issues with music playback (music volume always resets to max and tracks often do not play, including regular ambient tracks (sometimes) as well as every victory and defeat (always)). Developer Skybox has yet to fix the issue and I did not experience it in the non-Extended Edition.- My friend and I had trouble using the direct connect option for multiplayer, despite both configuring our firewalls to allow RoN through just like other games from this era. Fortunately the regular multiplayer lobbies work well enough anyway and we were able to get private games working via the Evolve VPN.- A few other mildly annoying misc bugs etc. that I did -not- notice in my non-Extended Edition copy of the game. (see the RoN: EE Discussion forum on Steam for some examples)- A few misc bugs which -were- present in the original haven't been fixed, but these are mostly minor. (e.g. in Entire World CtW you can accidentally ""give away"" your army the next turn if you sell a territory that you're moving into and don't cancel the move order)Worth buying again if you already own Thrones and Patriots? Maybe. I got it at 75% off so the smoother animations and anti-alising alone were pretty worthwhile for me. If getting the game running properly on your PC was a pain before then the relatively hassle-free Extended Edition might be worth your investment.If you've never played the game but think you'd enjoy it then I'd say the Extended Edition certainly seems like a much better option than grabbing the original. If you have vanilla, then maybe grab it on sale so that you can get Thrones and Patriots."

I like some aspects of the game like the resource gathering is simplified, moving aroung the map is easy, research is quite extensive and every stage of your civilization has some specific strategy and units.However there is a lot of things which I don't like and which are addressed even in Age of Empires 2:- units sometimes bounce each other and their movement is quite chaotic- you have a lot of units, but no commands to say...guard here, don't move. Protect your city and so on. Which is annoying because they follow enemy to his town and die- Really point management could be better and this game is exactly about that...create stream of resources, manage war buildings and rally point and push the enemy.- You will get frustrated as these issues above (especially lack of group specific orders) leads to troubles clear the whole map when you have superrior power already.So be carefull if you really want to buy this game.

The sprite assets are fantastically detailed for their time and still look good running on higher resoloution on a more modern PC. The overall difficulty of the single player aspect of the game is not that difficult at all and can be breased through in a few days, however the addition of Steam Achievements is much welcomed and sets another tier of challenges that compliment the way the game is played. I was most surpised however to see over 1,300 people online in the servers still playing this rather old title, which was really good to know.

This isn´t age of empires II, why is this on steam? well, let me tell you all, that this, it is an awesome game. although my play history on steam shows a pity amount of time spent on this game, I have played the hell out if Rise of nations on the cd fromat, since it was only recently added to steam.What is this ""Rise of nations"" then? well, Rise of nations is your usual RTS game (Real time strategy) and it is the old ""gather materials, Make people and soldiers, advance and conquer"" quite the normal rooster of mechanichs. what really differs this game from other games I have played (keep in mind i haven´t played all RTS games) is that the game has alot of mechanics and features that make the game really feel like you´re creating and advancing.E.g. is that the game has a feature with reasearch, basicaly, there are multible routes to develop in, economy, warfare, popuation and sience . this really changes the way you ""advance through the game. that means you don´t just upgrade your army and then destroy the enemy base in one go with only kind of troops, instead you might find it better to upgrade your economy and simply ""starve"" the enemy out by being able to consistently attack the enemy.A very nice feature that i found amazing, was the idea, that when ""creating"" a offensive unit, it gives you a platoon instead of a single unit, which makes the end game end (lol) in a enoumrus fight against highly numbered armies.Going back to the advancement, the game lets you advance from the culture age all the way up to modern age where you fight with rockets, tanks and jets.also, the game has a feature, where you have a relation to other nations/players. this means that you can be netrual, allied, friendly or in war with other nations and you can, during a game, ally with another player.The game, of course, isn´t flawless. E.g. is that the game is from 2003, which means, that the game has it´s limits, althoug the steam version is better, so the grapichs isn´t explecitly amazing. futhermore,  the terrain might seems a bit dull and it is quite easy to do a fast rush if you play a certian nation.All in all, this is, imo, a really great RTS game and it hold a certian nostalgic fealing to me.I hope that you found it just slightly useful - WIlhelm"

Everyone died.Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8This is basically an ""advanced"" version of the Age of Empires franchise with more strategical elements such as national borders, science, wonders, and... NUKES! Since Rise of Nations is a game developed by the same studio who developed Age of Empires (which is a great game too) I will be comparing the two in some aspects.Since Rise of Nations is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game it is all about multitasking, and the player who does that the best, wins. You start with a single town in the ancient era. You begin with a few citizen who are the ""builders"" of the game, as well as a bunch of farms and a lumber camp. (NOTE!!! Resources cannot be drained like in AoE, lumberjacks do not remove the forests, farms do not get exhausted and mines/mountains do not get mined to ground level. This is to bare in mind when you place new cities so you can place them in strategically good positions.) You start by increase your resource income, expanding your territory by building new towns and researching techs at the library. When you have reached the classical era and researched the neccesary techs you will be able to build troops and fight other nations.The tecs are one of the core elements in Rise of Nations. You will have to research certain techs to be able to build diffrent structures. There are 4 tech categories:Military - Increases population as well as allowing you to upgrade your troops so they match the current era.Civic - For every civic tech researched you will be able to build a new town (granted you have the resources and space). This tech also increases national borders as well as allowing you to research attrition, taxation, religion etc.Commerce - In Rise of Nations you have a so called commerce cap. If your commerce cap lies on 70, which is the default when no commerce techs are researched, you cannot gather more than 70 food, wood, gold, oil, metal or knowledge per minute. This means that a strong economy means that you will have to research a lot of commerce techs.Science - Science allows you to build certain economically important structures (such as granaries, lumber mills, smelteries, and refineries that boost the resource gathering) , as well as researching faster construction, healing, troop construciton etc.When you have reached the maximum level of the above noted techs you will be able to research Future Tech. These will greatly improve your chance of winning the game since they provide a great tactical and economical advantage.The combat in Rise of Nations is diffrent from many other games because of the national borders. If you are at war with another nation and attack with just tanks you will take attrition damage. The attrition constantly damages your troops and the only way to prevent attrition damage is to take a bunch of supply units with you. This is a way to prevent rushing and requires you to be tactical when attacking. (NOTE!!! You will also take damage when crossing the territority of a nation that you are in PEACE with and this attrition damage cannot be removed by supplu trucks. This is to prevent placing troops in a neutral country and then declare war to have an advantage.)There are much more to talk about but I think this sums up the core lements of the game. As I said in the beginning of the review, I strongly recommend this game. Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope you decide to by Rise of Nations."

If you like AoE or other strategy games, it is a MUST. This game is the state of the art of all the RTS out there in my opinion. The single player is awesome, you can conquer the world 5 different ways (you can even punish the ruski/yankee), lots of nations. This game is an easy start even if it has a lot of features (3-4x AoE).Unfortunately not so many people play ranked multiplayer, however, it would be beetter if many of us used ELO so the newbies would get against newbies, not pros. In addition, skybox left many bugs in the game and they are extremely slow in fixing (sorry guys, if you get no money for it I can completely understand, but I don't know whether you get paid or not).

I always play strategy games in some sort of story mode evolved around historical thematics and my imagination. This game is absolute winner for this kind of creativity and gameplay.A few days ago I completed a multi game where as Russians, I struggled against German and Chinese attacks with my team mate who played as Japanese.  Japanese forces made an outstanding defence to the last man as always but had to migrate to friendly territories at the end. We eventually surrendered 90% of the map and made a heroic stand in the streets of Moscow, Samurai and Russian musketeers, shoulder to shoulder under heavy artillery barrage. Thanks to the choke points and river in front of the city we managed to hold the city and eventually launched a simultaneous invasion from that small part to claim the rest of the map.I hadn't watched any movies that evoked as much feelings as in that 3 hours game for so many years ."

You can take over enemy cities when you attack them, and all non-military buildings will convert over to your control. Your opponents can do the same to your cities. When you build or conquer cities you take over land or territory, this territory must be maintained in order for you to win the game if you control a certain percentage. OR you can simply conquer the enemy's capital city and win this way. You can build various buildings for those who love having a wide variety of things to build.You can play single player in a ""story-mode"" or a custom/quick game. OR jump into multiplayer.You can advance from simple sword based units and slingers to unleashing the power of the sun and atoms by nuking your foes. Game is great and it can get overwhelming for some, but for those who are way better than me at Strategy games you may only feel right at home. Can get werid to advance fast enough to send tanks to crush enemies while your enemy might still have calvary units.There are several civilizations you can use like Native Americans (Aztecs, Inca, Maya, Iriquois) or Europeans (Great Britain, France, Dutch, etc). You can even choose the transplanted peoples of Europe who rebelled against Great Britain in 1776... The United States of America. You can play Alexander the Great's campaign, or during the Cold War (it's awesome!).You have to research pretty much everything. You have to research to build new cities, to build you military (you dont have to age to build military units like in Age of Empires, you just research it). You research commercial stuff, religion, and research enough stuff to be able to age. Once you age, you research even MORE stuff! There are way more things to research than in Age of Empires.This game is so awesome i'll give you a tip, be sure to set a timer to stop playing!It's imperative to your well being.Also, it is awesome to have several resources that must be obtained. You cannot stright off the bat exploit these resources or minerals, you have to RESEARCH or reach the necessary Age to get some of these resources. You can get Money, wood, food, oil, knowledge, and you have population limit (i might have missed one i think?).You can make infantry units, cavalry units/light armored vehicles, artillery/tanks, naval ships, and aeroplanes!When conquering your enemy's territory your troops can suffer from attrition just by being in enemy territory, but you can avoid this by creating special units. It is cool to have this element.Once again, SET AN ALARM! You don't want to play 4 hours straight and ask youself ""DAFUQ!?"""

Grin as you outrace your opponents and roll in some WW1 style tanks and artillery against their meager horse-back cavalry and canons, or if you're losing in the last stages of the game perhaps you'll flippantly let enough nukes fly to push the Doomsday clock to midnight and end the world (and the game).Many nations and tons of unique units and unit looks with both grand campaigns on world maps like Risk with played out battles, smaller historical based campaigns, or the endless fun of multiplayer make this a must own for anyone that likes the genre.

I highly highly recommend this game to my friends, because although Civilization is a terrifically addictive and fun game we don't all have time to spend the extravagant amount of time it requires. This game is very similiar and can be completed within a couple of hours. The main difference I noticed between the two was that Rise of Nations is based in real time and Civ is turn based.

Indeed the game also puts a focus on economy in addtion to military strength.Gameplay is pretty much standard across all factions with the only differences being in regards as to how the structures look and a handful of unique units for each faction. There are a few economic differences but that's about it in terms of differences.You take command of one of several different nations, guiding your nation from its humble beginnings in the stone age all the way to the modern age. Along the way, you research and develop new means of improving your nation such as by  developing currency based economics and acquirig wealth over a simple barter system. Over time your nation's boarders will expand and you'll control more territory which means more resources become availible to you. You start by needing simple food and lumber, later you develop the need for ore by mining at the base of a mountain. Later you discover a need for knowledge and so you construct universities to generate this knowledge through the schollars there. You also develop a need for wealth and set up caravans to travel between your various cities to generate this wealth.As you progress through each age, buildings and units will aesthetically change to match the period so your small initial starting village in the stone age will become a large metropolis in the modern age. Most military units have to be upgraded to the next stage of development and some units will disappear completely. Your sword and spearmen will eventually be replaced by gun toting minutemen and your horsemen will be replaced by an armored tank. Your old Triemes will be replaced by modern warships capable of inflicting incredible damage by comparison.Once in the modern age, you CAN develop nuclear weaponry but be advised that you should use it sparingly as there is a ""doomsday counter"" that begins the minute the first nuke impacts its target. Every time a nuke goes off, that counter goes down by one. If it reaches zero, everyone loses as the world burns.Another gameplay aspect takes the form of Wonder Points. Each faction can construct a number of wonders, each of which offering different advantages to the faction that builds them. Be warned however, if another faction builds a wonder before you, you cannot build that same wonder to gain the same benefit. The only way to get it is to capture the city that the wonder was built in, which will in turn, turn the wonder over to you. Each wonder is also worth a specific number of points with the Pyramids of Giza being the lowest and the Supercollider being worth the most.Victory conditions can be modified so that you can win in a variety of ways including but not limited to a military victory (i.e. conquering your enemies), a Wonder victory (accrueing the most Wonder Points), territory based (controling the most territory), or generic score based which includes military and economic scores.The game is a little dated as its 2D graphics for everything but they're good graphics even for their time and the gameplay holds up well against the tests of time."

I find the economy, tech tree and unit choice to be just slightly more complicated then I can ever really handle, or, to put it another way: perfect. The game is a juggling act with slightly too much for you to do to be comfortable: focus on your economy and you'll find you have no defense when the inevitable attack comes... focus on your military and your weak economy will rob you of reinforcements.Endlessly exciting, especially in multiplayer with a good group of friends. An excellent AI keeps single player interesting too. Once you lose a city or two and get put on the defensive it's incredibly hard to regain the upper hand. By the time your playing Tougher/Toughest this'll happen almost every game.... but it makes it a lot more rewarding when you beat back the enemy, reclaim your cities and then carry on through to flatten theirs.Cons?

Battles are huge, tense, and epic. You can always find ways to either get ahead or get left in the dust as every decision you make is crucial to your overall grand strategy. The resource management means you need to be on your toes about what you do and how it will affect history.It's also cool to see your civilizations grow throughout history and see the changes unfold in the military and in the cities. Imagine reducing a grand scale Civilization game down into one long tactical battle where cunning is as much of the essence as brute force. seeing the story of history unfold with one of your random games or during one of the thrilling alternate history ""conquer the world"" scenarios. This game gets tactics and logistics and for that I applaud it."

The territory mechanic, auto gathering when idle villagers and a really streamlined interface that tells you pretty much all you need, such as how many villagers are gathering X resource, makes this really easy to get into.The ""campaign"" is at the same time amazing and awful. It's pretty much a more complex WAR table game where the battles handled as skirmishes instead of dice. This means you have plenty of control of how the campaign goes, but at the same time feels somewhat anticlimactic as there is no dialogue, no special objectives and units, and the skirmishes are always 1x1, so it gets boring rather fast. And it is always funny defeating the romans as americans.There are plenty of nations in the game, and they actually encourage very different play-styles, so this is a huge bonus as well.There are plenty of modes to play, and most of them are fun too, so this is a bonus as well."

This is a real-time strategy game with deep but easy-to-manage economic systems and tech trees. Mechanics like territory, attrition damage, bonus-granting Wonders, and combat that rewards combined arms make this game a macromanager's dream come true, and yet Rise of Nations still rewards skilled micromanagement.The game is a delight to play in single-player against AI opponents and the Conquer the World campaigns add elements of persistent gameplay and another layer of strategic complexity. As with most strategy games, however, Rise of Nations truly shines in its multiplayer. A variety of customization options allow you to tailor your gameplay experience. If you only want to play from the medieval period to the early industrial age, you can do that. If you think nukes spoil the late game, you can ban them outright. The ability to customize your game and to form or break alliances on the fly help make this an unforgettable multiplayer experience.For those who have played Rise of Nations in the past and are wondering if the Steam version is worth it, I still absolutely recommend the Extended Edition. The biggest attraction is Steam-integrated multiplayer. With Gamespy now defunct, this is for all intents and purposes the only way to play this game online. I have had some hiccups trying to play online with some of my friends and the interface leaves a bit to be desired, but on the whole the system is a relatively pain-free way to get the multiplayer experience from this game. The ability to download the fully-patched version of the game anywhere through Steam is also not to be underestimated. The graphical updates were also a pleasant surprise to me. I had largely written them off when I considered buying the game on Steam, but the first time I fired up a game I noticed smoother animations, more consistent frame rates, and an overall much-improved graphical experience.To sum up, this is one of the greats of the RTS genre that has lost none of its appeal in the decade since its release. Thise game holds up against any other RTS game before or since, and is undoubtedly worth the $20 price of admission."

Blew me away at the time--it was like Age of Empires, but instead of being limited to knights and trebuchets, you could go all the way to aircraft carriers, mechanized infantry and ICBMs, as well as everything in between. Even more, you could Conquer the World, similar to Risk. The Thrones & Patriots expansion added a bit more polish to the game, sort of evened out a couple of rough edges, as well as added a wealth of content--new nations, campaigns, and systems of government. Probably the biggest thing besides being able to cover various historical periods is the way that cities are handled--they're valuable control points, not simply a building at the middle of your base (think more Civilization (but with less micromanaging) and less StarCraft).RoN holds up just as well today as it did then. Its mere existence may not blow my mind like it did when I was a kid anymore, but I don't think there'll ever be a day that I dislike the idea of firing up a quickmatch for old times' sake, or accidentally staying up all night seeking world domination in one of the several engaging singleplayer campaigns (then feeling like hell the next day but knowing full well that I'll have totally thrown my resolution to never do that again out the window). This game has everything when it comes to old-school RTS games. I highly recommend it, no matter who you are."

76561198049837614,Recommended,287450,31326971,Posted: 23 April,all,King Big Joe,"It's a nice if overrated strategy game, where nukes are underpowered until the Information Era and people still line up to shoot each other like it's the Enlightenment era....but in the Modern era. I give this a very hesitant thumbs up, but if it didn't have a few very awesome features (listed below  in pros) I wouldn't recommend this game.So, general pros:-Unique and well-implemented research tree, with cool future tech.-Attrition damage forces players to have supply lines before attacking enemy cities.-Kindof a mix of Age of Empires RTS and Civilization 5's focus on cities.-Naval combat is (mostly) balanced, with it's rock-paper-scissors approach giving it the best combat dynamic in the game.-Wonders are generally well done.-Great ethnic skins and unique units; for instance, the Romans for example use German uniforms in the Modern era. I thought that was clever.-Awesome Cold War campaign; I have yet to see another RTS/Turn based strategy game without a modern-only focus nail this down.-Nice alt history flavor in Napoleon campaign.Cons:-Armies are overly difficult to control, with fast units always outrunning slower units (like supply wagons), leaving them vulnerable to attack. I have to constantly assign them to slow down manually, which is a hassle if your nation has lots going on inside its borders.-Lots of balancing issues; for example, air power is completely useless in the Industrial era, only effective if the other team doesn't know what a flak gun is in the Modern Era, and OP in the Information era. And that is just the beginning; artillery can't seem to dent infantry, infantry can do enormous amounts of damage to a cruiser, aircraft can't scratch ground targets unless they are from carriers or are large bombers, etc.-No real army control; you basically always need every unit in the army to win a war, which is annoying because it robs the player of the army-building experience. You can't make an army of armor, artillery, mobile AA and some sparse infantry without getting mowed down by an opposing army because they have bazookas and you don't.-The government feature is kinda just thrown in; there is no real reason to choose republic. Just go socialist/monarchy in order to have the military bonuses. Only two choices, the second one doesn't really give much.-The economic waste feature seems broken. It's a great idea but I can let resources breach the cap and it just seems like they just gather faster. Like waste isn't a con at all.-The campaign maps clearly were not playtested properly (besides the Cold War campaign); I'll give an example from the New World campaigns. I started as Spain in the Caribbean, and decided to first attack Hispaniola--which was not occupied by any nation, and therefore should have been a very easy target. The RTS map is a bunch of islands inhabited by warlords, one of which you ally with and the rest you fight. They had Triremes and galleys while I had sloops and cannon frigates. No matter how many ships I had, no matter if I had sloops or men O wars, their fleets of galleys had MORE ARMOR than my ships and more firepower. It was a ratio of 4:1 at least (4 of mine for every 1 of theirs), making it completely impossible to conquer the map because somebody in the script had nerfed the hell out of European ships and turned the Classical era galleys into dreadnaughts. This issue kept cropping up in the campaigns all of the time.-Resources are inexhaustible, ruining any potential for resource wars; once you have an oil well, you always have oil. Once you have a forest,you never have to worry about running out of trees. Kinda lame, if you ask me.-Environment is very stale and lifeless; no wild animals, no beauty in the environment. It all feels stale, unlike other games.-No WW2 campaign, despite a tutorial with it featured. Or World War I.-Tactics and terrain never matter, it's just line up and shoot; every time you inevitably clash with another nation, the way of waging war is always the same no matter the era,; Army A approaches target city, hits it a few times, Army B attacks Army A in a chaotic mob fashion, both fight in a blur of explosions, battle ends--OR--Army A haphazardly runs into Army B while en route to target city, all line up and charge/blindly shoot with confusion, battle ends. While there is a flanking bonus, and going behind someone can destroy their wagons/arty, for the most part the game revolves around throwing bodies into the meat grinder and seeing who wins out (or who launches a nuke first). Naval battles have some more depth than this, what with submarines and aircraft carriers, but usually it's the same Fleet A runs into Fleet B/Fleet A provokes Fleet B near a city.-Air combat is very poorly implemented; while strategic and stealth bombers are death from the skies, when airplanes fight it's virtually impossible to control/direct them in combat. It's just a mess of barely 3d planes strangling each other in some kind of twisted fast-moving soup of metal.So yeah, very hesitant thumbs up. If the research tree was any worse, or there was no Cold War campaign, I would say look elsewhere. If you want a good Modern Warfare game, stick to the Wargame series. If you want turn-based strategy and RTS gameplay, look to the Total War series. If you want a good RTS, go to Age of Empires. If you want broad strategy along with good tactical warfare, stick with Civilization 5. If this goes on sale for a few dollars, get it if you want."

76561198044801590,Recommended,287450,31507114,Posted: 2 May,all,LORD_GREM,"This is my first steam game that I've bothered to write a review for simply because, of all the games in my library, I feel that RON is most deserving and in need of it. If you were a fan of this game in the early 2000s like I was, I can assure you, the game's re-release on steam only enhances the original experience. Otherwise this is practically the same game, and more then deserving of your hard earned $20, (in my opinion easily worth $30-$40, yes it's that good). And if you got it on sale, it’s practically a steal.Now back in the early 2000s this was the only game that was ever able to compete with the giant of RTSs at the time AOE2, (sorry empire earth guys but RON is the better more polished game). And in my opinion is a better game than AOE2. Also while I like the more hardcore Cossacks and American Conquest, RON has certain game mechanics that I personally enjoy and RON has far-less micromanaging without sacrificing all that much in complexity and strategic gameplay.What makes RON so great is that is combines the mechanics of traditional RTS games like AOE2, with gameplay mechanics from traditional turn-based games like the civilization series, into a polished, triple-A, well-balanced RTS. It also streamlines the management of your particular nation so you don't spend 80% of your time micromanaging workers, and allows you to focus on macro-decisions that determine who will win the game. Don't get me wrong worker placement and the efficient use of resources is huge, but this game has far more to offer then just that and your occasional battle.The key gameplay mechanic that separates RON from the rest of the genre, is the city mechanic and use of national borders. Anyone familiar with the CIV series will likely be able to easily understand this. On the map there are things like vast forests, mountains full of ore, oil rich plains, and rare resources that will not only give you resources, but bonuses that can give you benefits from the mundane buff, to game-altering keys to a winning strategy. Borders will also damage unsupplied enemy armies in your territory. How do you expand borders, build cities and forts, research techs like religion, and techs like taxation will give you gold, the more of the map you control. You can try to turtle in RON but you will likely not fare so well.At your senate, choosing your government type is another huge decision, and wonders aren't just a victory type. Wonders grant you amazing benefits and you'll probably want to build some for their buffs alone, even if you’re not going for a wonder victory. Nations have unique units and benefits that make each nation play different. And the game goes from the ancient era to the modern day. Also even for the bland stock unit types and buildings: European, Asian, Middle East, Native American...etc. all have different skins that help with the immersion.While I'm little rusty and was laugh out of multiplayer queues at first, I've since begun to rehome my RON skills and found new appreciation for this game. Over a decade later it still holds up and is far better than many other present-day RTS that too often tend to be buggy, unfinished cash grabs. The AI is quite good and your allies aren't actually useless. In fact I would highly recommend playing the tutorial and then playing quick battles with diplomacy. Also I prefer to set the research to expensive and slow so as to better immerse myself in each age. Modifying match rules to your personal preferences is quite easy.The king of old-school RTS style games is back. ""Hail to the King baby""."

You know what kind of game and the kind of graphics your getting in the buy. It's a older game with not bad graphics, and an RTS style with resource collection and military build up. It's even based on a branch version of EE or Empire Earth if you've ever played it. There are MANY MANY different scenarios for starting a game.Pros: Good fun combat for awhile, with nice tools and upgrades and things that really matter to your economy and military. You can play a overhead map game conquering lands and upgrading them. Which then leads into ground mission of differing variety. This game does a good job on multiplayer, especially being an old game.Cons: Im sorry but, when you pass the standard bot, the bot cheats excessively. Making it hard to enjoy the game when you get bored of the standard bots. Furthermore, there is no campaign and it would have been nice to see that and experience it in this RTS form. Another annoying tid bit is the non existant diplomacy, there is one, but it is a joke. There is peace or war and the bot is hostile. You can only be allies with one bot, and they are usually unhelpful. The overhead map that places you in varies parts of the world or the world is somewhat basic. It uses a turn system, ok, but you can run out of turns before doing anything worth while. Its an awsome addition, if there was a new game like this, I would hope they would use and upgrade it.Conclusion: Its MULTIPLAYER, or very bored single player. I would only really recommend this if you where going to play with friends."

Sometimes these units are not historical correct. Like the Roman units are still available during the middle ages. But that is a minor thing and probably a decision for the gameplay.You can also build wonders (like the Eiffel tower, Palace of Versailles, Colloseum, etc) from all over the world to boost your nation with extra benefits. From gathering your resources or maxing out your population limit.The game works for the most part exact the same way as the Age of Empires games, so if you played those this game is easy to understand.Overal, this game is a ton of fun and I reccomend this to everyone who loves stragegy games."

Its the little things that make it stand out, like the way a worker, if they where working at something nearby before building, returns to doing that thing when they are done building! There are a lot of more 'advanced' games that don't think of these kinds of things. There are also alternate victory types, which is a nice touch.Unforutnately, there are two weaknesses, the big one is that the tech tree advances the exact same way no matter who you are playing, while a good balancing measure it means who you play doesn't matter quite as much as it should. The more minor one is that its lack of fantasy elements, I prever my grand strategy with fantasy or science fiction elements while this game is still slightly too close to reality. Especially since they chose simplified versions of historic events for the tutorials. Its just a bit jarring.Still, I think its a very good game, and this is coming from someone who thinks that the Civilization series didn't get good until recently and is often disappointed with remastered strategy games."

Normally I limit the ages back to where the gunpowder age is the last age or so because most races lose there special units right around then and have no more unique units which i find slightly dissapointing aswell as if you let the game go on into the later ages it becomes less about stratagy and just more unit spam because everyone is on equal footing as i said the most unique units end in the earlier ages there ofcourse is some exceptions. That asides it is a game that you have to manage your resources into what you wish to upgrade next whether its library upgrades or if its unit upgrades or if you wish to expand your army or build a new city and expand your nation. But again as you get to the later ages the upgrades dry up and everyone is pretty much on equal footing and its just a matter of who has more units and more resources to amass the units.

Once Steam released the Extended version, it was nice to find some additional content added since and a return to the enjoyable times I had. If you've played the more popular AOE2 (Age of Empires II) then expect something similar as far as UI with easier unit control and enhanced graphics (as this game came out later than AOE2).

76561198056024440,Not Recommended,287450,35479860,Posted: 4 October,all,Seppelator,"As far as gameplay is concerned, I really like the game. However, recent updates cracked the game: I used to play with friends via the in-game game browser and it worked fine a long time. After a patch in August, we started having out-of-sync errors after 15-25 minutes playtime. These ultimately lead to players being dropped. Network connections should not be an issue, as all are quite fast. After restarting the saved game, my instance for RoN crashed everytime I would try to connect/start a new game. As this renders the game currently unplayable, I do not recommend the game. Additionally, the support from the current developers seems to be quite passive (if existent at all)."
