I didn't remember most of it anyway.What I truly love about this game is that most of the puzzles are very logical (and rather simple), unlike the new tendency of adventure games, which are usually based on gathering a lot random items without apparent reason, which you will have to combine (I positively hate pixel hunting), and where you don't always understand what you are supposed to do or, more important, why. In this game, everything you do has a purpose in the story. Futhermore, some of your choices have an impact on your progress (and score).I liked the story and the artwork so much, that I didn't care that the quality of the graphics was not the last of the last. Oh, and I found a little bug that made me have to restart the game (the importance of saving).Now, the truth is that it is a short game and the only interest of playing it again would be to try to get a higher score. But I am a sucker for this exact kind of game, so I loved it (and replayed it!)."

While the plot was a little... contrived, I did like the theming.Good:For the most part the puzzles were enjoyable. My favorite part was the potion brewing.The enviroments and puzzles are pretty!Your goals are petty straighfoward, and for the most part it's hard to get stuck.Astrology! Alchemy! Potions! Stars!Bad:Timed puzzles. Those are a sick and cruel joke.Sometimes it felt like you were relying on dear ol' dad's help too much.Meh to stiff voice acting.Controls can cause motion sickness."

There's a bit of recipe mashing, collecting ingredients and such, but for the most part, it is point & click.The graphics are 1024x768, and that looks decent enough (remember, TV and DVD have had worse resolution for decades). The graphic art is actually well done, I've seen a lot cheaper (and the orginal Myst never looked as good). That said, it is still a game where you stop at fixed positions, and then you can rotate the view and interact with the surroundings, or move to another position.The game gets full marks for the atmosphere and the storyline so far; for the actual puzzling, there are too few hints, which had me needlessly stumped because I couldn't figure out what the game wanted me to do."

Though many may be turned away by the chunky graphics, this is a game that has really captured the true experience of a well made and thoughtful point-and-click adventure game. The voice acting is well done, the graphics (though blocky) are still pleasing to the eye, and the storyline is top notch.The puzzles range from simple recipies to weight distribution to complex translation of old celtic to french. Though you may find yourself doing many crafting puzzles, they are balanced thoughout the game and not used as a crutch, but as a way of transitioning the player from one objective to the next.The only issue I had with the game was that several timed puzzles and one particular quick-time event left me frustrated. It is important to save and save often.Other than that, this game was one of the most thought provoking and inviting point-and-click games I have ever played. Being a history buff, I would love to see more games like this, perhaps with characters from William Shakespeare plays. I would recommend anyone who wants a true adventuring experience like Myst to check this out."

Nostradamus, your father, is in his late years now: old, weak, and frail. Since your brother is away, and because of the time period a woman does not seem fit to handle the task, your father sees it best to disguise you as your brother to help the queen's mother solve the mystery of people close to her dying as she is now in fear of her own life.Being a Microids game, the gameplay is quite good with a lot of similarities to Syberia and Return to Mysterious Island. It involves a lot of detective work with very engaging puzzles. The game also provides a good foundation of early astrology and chemistry. Highly enjoyable."

I dont think I've ever been so aggrevated while playing a game. Repeatedly you'll find yourself solving puzzles you really have no way of solving, or so you think. Turns out, for the most part, you'll have to flip between the pages of your in-game diary, or jott down symbols that you have seen on a wall or similar places.If they would have made this game so that once you know the basics of the solution so does your character, then this game would have been more enjoyable. As it stands now, it really is'nt.Also the dialog can't be skipped. This turns really irritating when you have to play certain parts again, or if you happen to click on the wrong dialog option by mistake. This was especially annoying when I at one point had limited time to solve a puzzle, but I obviously had more than enough time to listen to a bunch of rather meaningless dialog.There were a few bugs I experienced, one of which almost made me quit playing, but nothing really gamestopping.If you're an experienced ""point'n clicker"" and one of the most patient humans alive, you might enjoy the story however. The puzzles were also good (if the mechanics had been better, that is) and quite original. Once you had solved them, and after you stopped crying and trying to scratch your eyes out, you really get a sense of achievement. Because it's really not an easy game.The voice acting was so-so, the graphics are OK and the music is... present.I don't think I could have finished this one without a good walkthrough though. So if you plan on playing this game I suggest you find one online.I also suggest that you make sure noone can hear your screams of rage...My last tip, for those of you brave enough to venture forth, would be; read your diary. Then read it again, and again, and again... and again. Are you still here? Hello?"

,Recommended,287720,20306990,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,ShinOnna,"Recently, I've been on a point-and-click spree. While most games disappointed, Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy actually won me over, and over, and over again.What is so good about this game?First of all, it's the graphics - they are old, sure. But they are accordingly old. It's not like you're supposedly playing a game set in 2044 while it looks like it's actually 1999. Then, you have an immersive OST and a lovely background music choice in most locations.The puzzles are something that I would like to compliment extensively. You have puzzles that are actually involved in the story line. This, you won't see often even in puzzle-based quests. They are different; you cannot solve two in the same way or even with the same type of analogy. You have different types of puzzles: from reflectory to balancing to runes. On top of this, they really do seem important.Something else I love about it is that they never really killed the good old guy, although many characters did meet their end.I particularly enjoyed the cross-dressing part. A nice twist on the old gender definitions. And yet, even this was realised through puzzles. You need to arrange voice manneurisms in order to achieve complete consistency.If anyone is wondering if they want to try this game, I wholeheartedly recommend it to them. If you think the puzzles are too hard, it just means you need more experience - they are one of the most pleasurable parts of point-and-click adventure games."

I'm not sure if it's just the way this game was designed but the way the game moves when you move your mouse is very nausiating.

76561198023019965,Recommended,287720,32789789,Posted: 25 June,all,Pablo,"Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy was made by a group of french developers who were related to Cryo the company that created Atlantis The lost Tales in 1997. This game was made in 2007 ~ so it was a welcome back to some great puzzles and game things that were missing at that time. The game doesn't have high production values and that shows especially today after 10 years, but still what keeps my interest in this game now and kept it long time ago when i played it for the first time was the game mechanics. This game has a story of course (it is not only puzzles) there are many dialogs and there is story development to be found, suspense and murder along the way, but the main thing about this game was its puzzles (most of them, not all) wich are, interestingly @fun@ (who would knew!) something that other adventure games lack some times (many times).Of course, that depends largely on what you consider fun as a puzzle, but if you are interested in playing as madeleine, daughter of nostradamus, in the XVI century france, making potions , food and weird concotions at the laboratory and then drawing astrological charts, writing predictions based on natal charts and looking at constellations to find hidden clues to a murder(s) then i think you will like it. The game, as a said, gives you in several parts of the game receipts to prepare all sorts of things ranging from making bread (!) preapring tea, to preparing aphrodisiac and then making a mold key or even make up. All is fun and well done and you have many of the ingredients in you lab, but some of them you will have to go and look for them.  In other parts of the game you go to Nostradamus observatory and look to the stars or use one of his contraptions to make predictions and birth charts. Some of them are intuitive and some of them are not (there are a few obscure puzzles there) but you always have the option to use a walkthrough if you are stuck) The game has many environmental and action puzzles, meaning doing things related to a scene. Of course you investigate crime scene(s) and you have your hour glass thingy, and you scalpel, and tweezer and all the renaissance detectives tools you could wish for (and you will use them, each one of them)The third and most interesting thing about this game was the role played by madeleine (the main character in this game)She is a woman from the XVI century and as such she is not given the same allowance to do things as his brother, cesar, so, when a murder is comitted in the royal court and nostradamus is called to investigate but he is not able to go because of his deteriorating health, he sends his daughter dress as man (madeleine's brother) so as to allow her to investigate and do all necesary things to solve the mistery. And far from being a gender thing (wich it is of course) the character uses her disguise as a man to investigate and meet some characters, but also changes to be dressed as a woman (as herlself) to take advantage of that in certain situations. So, instead of taking a solemn approach and making it a gender thing only, and showing up as a victim herself, on the contrary the main character, madeleine, plays around its limitations that society puts on her because of being a woman in the XVI century and instead she takes advantage of that and plays around it and takes advantage of all the characters around her, as a woman and as a man, making it a true androgynous character, wich is refreshing in a way, and also takes courage to do so in a game. But, anyway, thats not the main point of the game (allthough you are crossdressing from beginning to almost the end, when you cover is off) but the main story is the murder of someone in the court of the queen wich is related to an old prophecy nostradamus wrote , and off you go to investigate that and work with nostradamus across several days.The end of the story, its a little rushed and could have been a little more developed, but it serves the story right and all is completed, one way or the other. The expression of all the characters in this game, its a little lacking...especially for that few moments where important things happens, but again, its a game from 2007, and a low budget one at that, so you can't ask for a fully developed graphical experience here. What you will get instead its a game full of things to do, obects and ingredients to get , many potions to prepare, a lot of crossdressing to take advantage of and a good amount of astrological drawings and birth charts to make along the way."

The game is totally on rails, and there are only a handful of active characters and places that you can enter.  Voice acting was done pretty well, although the background music can grate your nerves if you get stuck on something.   There were several days that I had to quit for the night and revisit later when I could think more clearly, and even so I visited a guide once when I became very stuck.All in all, this was a well-written story/game.Edit: Perhaps the most important thing to mention was that I got this game in a bundle, and recommend waiting for it to go on a similar sale, as it can be mildly infuriating at times.

I ran in on Windows 10 and it worked perfectly.The game has a rather unique atmosphere and nice voice acting, visuals and music. It's for fans of the genre - not for someone who want a straightforward and popular game. Even though the game involves murder mystery it has a nice and almost cozy atmosphere most of the time. Unlike some point and click adventures it's actually possible to take a few different roads at certain times. Not something that changes the story dramatically, but it adds a nice flavour.It took me 7 hours to complete and I think I was neither slow nor fast. I guess fast players could complete it in 5 hours while other players would get stuck forever.Some of the puzzles are really innovative and a few are almost impossible (e.g. the very last prophecy puzzzle). I actually needed paper and a pencil to solve some of the puzzles which I think is good. You have to really think to complete this game.

The renaissance Italy, full of colors and rich in details, provides an excellent and atmospheric setting for the upcoming adventure. Nostradamus, horoscopes (strangely called ""charts"" in the game), historical figures, sinister plot threatening the ruling family, all that is very promising and fresh. You can even pose as man or woman according to your wish, and the dialogues play slightly differently, which I found impressive.However, as the game unveils, its quality starts to deteriorate. The translation is not very good, sometimes you wrestle with an odd expression of unclear meaning. There is absolutely minimal amount if animation in the game - a guard extends his arm, woman throws dice, Nostradamus nods and smiles. At one occasion, you talk to a person over a closed door, which no doubt saved the dev team some time and effort.  The late game puzzles become infuriating, especially a particular substitution cipher where you must decipher.. a French text, probably because translating the cipher would take too much effort. The characters are barely legible and sometimes similar, for example the character ""-"" (hyphen) means three different letters.The game also suffers from a split personality disorder. One moment you discover a dead body in a room, and are getting ready to open his personal chest to shed light on his murder, but your character refuses - Nah, probably nothing in there. Just another corpse. Without reporting your find, you are suddenly teleported to your home. Nostradamus listens to your  report about the murder and then gives you a very important task - to brew a herbal tea, so that you can sleep better. I run back to the castle in the middle of the night, but the drawbridge was closed. Nobody cares. Another dead body? Old news.The game ends, I imagine, in a moment when the dev team run out of finances, their creditors probably stormed their offices, and started confiscating computer equipment. A duo of a artists have decided to quickly conclude the game with a 20 seconds long cutscene that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and that's it, end of story.""You have finished the game with %d points"".""%d"" is a symbol for numeric value in formatted print.

Which really aren't there... The game uses quite a low resolution, which cannot be changed at all. Low res on a 24"" monitor, plus low fps (I'm guessing it's locked at 30 or so) - almost immediately after starting playing, it feels very straining on the eyes.The game itself:There hardly anything that explains how to play, and you'll have to mess around with the inventory a bit to understand how things works. That is, after you actually have found some items. Puzzles can be absolutely horrible, not because of the difficulty, but because of poor mechanics. For example, I was going to mix ingredients, did something wrong, and lost everything, with the result having to run around gathering them again.The difficulty is mostly determined by how good you are at finding things, nothing else. If you overlook an item, a puzzle won't be solvable, and it's not easy to find them all. Nothing reveals what can be picked up, unless you point directly at it.The game has voice acting - obviously they didn't hire professionals for it, because it's horrible.Small changes could have made this one an excellent game, but as it currently is, I wouldn't recommend this game at all."

Yup, trying to butcher hundreds.  Oh, now a priest.  Yup, same thing.Hey, there's a monk...  Yup, you guessed it.By purchasing this game you are funding the most vile bigotry that exists on steam.I deeply regret playing this game."

76561198025152136,Recommended,287720,26745349,"Posted: 22 November, 2016",all,VonScript,"I have a fondness for puzzle games and this game caught my attention, so I bought it as soon as I could. Overall, this game is quite impressive.I really enjoyed the storyline and how it unfolded so eloquently; it's quite the crime story. The music added great atmosphere and didn't interfere with the voice-over, SFX, or the gameplay itself. The aesthetic of the game was spot on and the game itself designed to allow quite a bit of freedom to wander around; I wanted to explore every nook and cranny of the map to see what I can find and what I can interact with.It does have a few shortcomings though. The voice actors didn't really convince me of anything; it actually sounded like they were reading their script. The characters themselves are very stiff; there wans't enough animation done to allow body language so at times it seemed as though you were interacting with a cardboard cutout. The game is also rather short, and it feels short; I would have liked it to be a bit longer with a few more puzzles.With all that said, I would recommend this game to anyone wanting to play something a bit different."

I loved the storyline, it isn't as corny as most storylines go for games like these. As far as alternate histories go, it's pretty solid.I think it would've been cool if there were Steam achievements available though. I mean, who can eat *that* much bread in one night???(POSSIBLE SPOILER) :Maybe it's just me, but I think a sequel would be cool. Another (cross-dressing/disguise-filled) adventure for Madeleine? Maybe her brother discovering her little ruse, and what does he have to say about that? (*whispers* Madeleine discovering she might be bi, or something, who knows.)"
