76561198140299850,Recommended,287900,21569243,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,foofaraw,"I've been playing pinball, off and on, for over 50 years, and I've played hundreds of tables. I've played every table by both major companies on Steam to the tune of many thousands of games, but all that is pretty much in the past, because I have discovered Pro Pinball Ultra's ""Timeshock"" table. Most days it’s the only pinball I play.In the 35 days since Timeshock was released 0n 1/27/16, I've recorded over 1,200 games. And I've yet to even BEGIN to be bored with playing the same table, mostly because Timeshock has so much depth and challenge. It's hard! I would go so far to say that even with its ""novice"" mode, it's not a table for beginners, but it IS the table to strive toward playing, no matter one's skill level, or the amount of time one has to devote.With Timeshock's many challenging modes, including a 4-level video mode that really adds tremendously, there is no clue when a game begins if it will end with a score of 3 million, or 300 million....or much more. I tend to have a short attention span and often get frustrated fairly easily, but at least for me, Timeshock is pretty much rage-proof, because it's just so MUCH fun to play! (And I’m really only an average pinball player.) The challenge of some shots is the very source of the tremendous feeling of success I sometimes get, and I can honestly say that with time comes much greater proficiency, and tremendous personal satisfaction.Timeshock offers a very complex story about time travel, and the acquisition of artifacts from the varying periods visited.  The table guide I typically use, by Jens Goering -http://www.jeeens.de/t/t.html, is 32 pages of valuable information and graphics, very well written and structured. Clearly, this is no simple table to be mastered overnight, but rather a commitment than might require years of pure joy.Not only is the Timeshock table itself interesting and challenging, there are numerous varying methods of play to choose from, each adding its own dimension of fun. As well, each has its own leaderboard to track progress against players the world over. It even has an unusual “glass removed” feature that allows the player to investigate the table actions in great detail (but does not count on leaderboards.) If a player had done well on the first three balls during any regular game, Timeshock offers the opportunity to extend the game by up to three additional balls for what offers the possibility of REALLY high scores for the best players. And Timeshock has my ALL-TIME favorite score in pinball; Lucky!, a 5 million point shot when you almost lose the ball down the left outlane. (Admittedly, I haven’t personally accessed many of the high-score features, so please forgive and notify if errors have been made in this review.)At first glance it might seem that Timeshock is more expensive than most single computer pinball tables, and I really bought it because I had heard so much about it for so long. (It is a truly legendary pinball table, perhaps the MOST renowned single computer pinball table available.) But while I paid about $15US, after a little over a month it comes to just over a penny a game, a pittance I’m grateful didn’t prevent me from THE pinball experience of my lifetime.Perhaps one of the finest features of Timeshock came on Day One when I was unable to complete installation on one of my laptops. The DEVs requested pertinent info from my PC, and within 2 -3 days had graciously corrected the problem. As I often say, perhaps the best feature of any game is an attentive DEV. (Thank you, all.)If you love pinball and want both a great challenge AND great fun, Timeshock will very likely be THE pinball experience you will never regret considering.(As with most Steam games, offline Timeshock play is not tracked.)"

Have also owned what is considered to be one of the best ever designed physical tables - the twilight zone.Ever since the original pro pinball timeshock came out around 20 years ago it was clear to me that this was an exceptionally designed game in every way.The fact that now,with updated graphics,controller support (no input lag finally!) 64 bit compatability and a beautiful UI/menu design (and it is still a work in progress!) shows that the saying "" true classics never age"" is so true.I would also like to pass on that the team behind this amazing remake (I believe it is the original dev's) have done amazing work and I commend them for their quality and attention to detail - well done! ,please keep up the good work! :)"

But I found it completely worth it. Just in case I do have my rose-tinted glasses on. I collect PC pinball games and bought the original Pro Pinball Timeshock on release date, big box, green CD jewel case back in the 90's. But the graphics on this version are phenomenal. I can't wait for this company to release the other 3 pinball games in this series. That would be great. Icing on the cake, bought it on the Summer sale 2017."
76561198060219701,Recommended,287900,33329718,Posted: 6 July,all,lostcraft,"Summary:If you prefer a forgiving, flashy kind of pinball, PFX 2 might be more to your liking, but if you (like me) like your pinball a bit more realistic and / or already know Timeshock from the 90s, don't hesitate to shell out the money and get your fix!Highly recommended!The Long One:I was very happy to see Pro Pinball return to the PC- I loved the series back in the day and Timeshock is the shiny crown jewel of the four PP tables. Hells, I still have the original CDs in a box somewhere :DIf you're more familiar with recent videogame pinball, prepare for a surprise. Timeshock is a pretty accurate simulation, with very accurate physics and a steep learning curve. This is a game where you can pull off tricks like dead stops, airballs, soft and hard nudges and a couple other trickery that work on an actual physical table. And you wil lneed a certain bit of finesse because Timeshock is not an easy table to beat. Some shots require carefull juggling of the silver ball, and the layout is complex enough to require a bit of adjustment.But there's a lot waiting for you.Like most pinball tables, the ""story"" is less than stellar. Some scientist tinkered with something really experimental and accidentally scattered the whole universe, which is BAD. So she jumped into her time-machine and got bcak into her past which is your present and now you must save the universe. For some reason, this involves a lot of pinball.The Timeshock table is a highly stylized beast of a pinball. Center stage is a glowy green crystal, surrounded by figurines representing several time zones. Timeshock mines its time-travel theme for all it's worth: The goal of the game is to collect fuel and crystals in four eras, time-warp between said eras and not only rack a lot of points, but also save the universe by reaching the wizard mode and create an anti-timeshock.The amount of modes and little surprises the game crams into one table is astonishing. There is a clear structure: Enter time zone, find fuel, power up the warp engine, lock balls into time machine, then leave the era and snatch a crystal fragment on the way... but there's so much more, from unique missions to ramp frenzies and the elusive midnight mode. Even after months wort of playing time (pre-Steam) I am sure I haven't seen everything Timeshock has in store.The ""Ultra"" already signifies that this is not the original, which IS a bit dated. Ultra Timeshock looks much better than the pre-rendered table of old, with crisp dynamic lighting, beautiful reflextions and colourful flashy lights. It stays true to its roots though: This is not an over-the-top ""videogame"", it's a honest-to-god simulation. The table is presented without scrolling, there are no animated characters suddenly assaulting your balls, and the stylized look creates a somewhat sparse background for the silver ball. This may make you frown, but the stellar soundtrack and the hilariously hammy voice-acting will turn that frown upside down.A fun little extra is the ""glassless"" mode: At any time you can remove the table glass and move the balls around with your mouse, and this is actually a valid way to get to know the table and figure out how to beat missions. It's a gimmick but it does have its use.All in all, Timeshock is a table for pinball enthusiasts longing for a hard, honest simulation. It takes time to rack up decent scores, and mastering the whole table may well take a few weeks, but it's great glorious fun."

For those moaning about the download in-game before play - it's a clever solution to the reality that on PC, you have a huge range of resolutions, and that the game uses pre-rendered graphics, and you want it to look pristine at almost all resolutions - and oh my, but what pre-rendered graphics these are, especially with the adjustable lights! - if they were all included in the game download, the game would be over a hundred GB big.If you haven't played a Pro Pinball game before... basically they're still the best original pinball tables I've ever played.  Tons of depth in a single table - Timeshock here takes an hour gameplay to hit the final feature.For the amount you can play this table, the asking price is a steal.  And they've even thrown in DMD support and all the other trimming for those lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with a virtual pinball cabinet.  Amazing."

Picking your video resolution is kind of strange because the game just shows several views in the menu without telling you what resolution they're optimized for and what's worse is every time you pick a different camera view the game forces a couple of gigabyte download on you so you can use that view.The game has one portrait mode view and the rest are made for a landscape screen.  You can use all of them while in portrait mode but they'll be cropped at the top an bottom.  I'm using this with the 2560 portrait view and the table looks great.Unlike the developer who has seasons of real world tables this game doesn't cap the FPS and this game uses HD textures instead of blurry crap from a mobile port.

If you like pinball or are just even slightly interested in it, buy it now.This is a graphically updated version of the excellent pinball simulation Timeshock from 1997. The Pro Pinball series was the absolute top of PC pinball back then and has not been surpassed since. This updated version does the game justice. The updates include higher resolution, better lighting and portrait mode, which of course works great for pinball.The table itself is unchanged, which is a good thing. It remains one of the best tables I have ever played virtual or real. The table design is perfect, the shots have exactly the right difficulty and feel very satisfying. The ruleset is very deep, there are an incredible number of modes, super modes, wizard modes, frenzys, manias, video mode... etc. which will keep all but the most seasoned pinball veteran occupied forever. (I have played this table for almost 20 years and never reached the super wizard mode in normal play.) The modes and table elements all interact to form a path and a story. Still, the table keeps a simple elegance and is not overwhelming, even for beginners.The updated graphics are gorgeous, the light show at the beginning of the time travel mode is one of the best in any pinball machine. The sound and music were not upgraded, but still do the job nicely. The guitar music soundtrack is a matter of taste, I personally like it a lot. There are different tracks for different game situations and modes and they fit very nicely.This is a simulation of a real world pinball table, there even is an operator's menu to tweak the internal settings of the machine. That also means it is quite difficult, especially compared to the more arcady games like Pinball FX and Pinball Arcade. The table is unforgiving, but never unfair. Through the operator's menu the game can be made easier, but for me the standard settings work well.There are a few things that are still missing: UI to change default controls, controller support and more table views. I was the most disappointed that they have not improved the physics to at least the level of the later Pro Pinball games „Big Race USA” and “Fantastic Journey” yet, I hope this is coming soon. The current physics model is from the original game. It is by no means bad and feels very real. It is in every way superior to other games like Pinball Arcade. But the physics of the later Pro Pinball games are even better and I was hoping that 20 years later and with superior hardware, this could have been taken up another notch.These things are promised, unfortunately Barnstorm Games has not exactly convinced with speed on what is a mere upgrade and has struggled through 2 years of development. I hope they can improve their development process and dedication to the PC platform, implement the missing features soon and hopefully even upgrade the other old tables and design new ones.While the price of this game is higher than other tables on the market, it is absolutely justified by the superior simulation. The table design is on a completely different level than Pinball FX tables and the realism and graphics easily and clearly surpass Pinball Arcade. This table makes these other pinball games look bad by comparison. It would be amazing if the Pinball Arcade developers could reach the same level of detail and realism. The table design can absolutely compare to some of the best real tables out there, so it is not surprising that there is a company working on a real world version of Timeshock.I have been playing the original for almost 20 years and I know I will play this for at least as long. For an early access game it is already very much playable and I can recommend it highly to both pinball experts and beginners."

Had given up on seeing this game running on pc forever but then i found this. With this release on steam it is again running like a dream.Just bought a Samsung UE55KS7005 and testet the game on the television.Started with the 2180P mode witch is 4K.At first it did now run that well. Played around with the settings and when you change the resolution it downloads new textures but only the first time you set a resolution. On a fast internet connection it is quick. Found out that i was running some programs that made it run pourly. After closing those programs it ran ok but not smooth. I allso had some input lag witch is worse then the game not running smooth because when you press the controller you have some time before it reacts in the game. When playing it on my monitor i had no input lag. On the tv i switched on gaming mode and that removed all of the input lag.But the game still didnt run smooth. Backed the resolution down to 1440P and now it runs like a dream again.Thank you so much for this. This is and has allways been the best pinball game for pc.

Even to this day it's considered by many to be the best pinball game ever made. The ball physics are spot on and it's the only pinball game that I've played which actually feels like a real table. All the others just feel like computer games next to this.This Ultra HD remake plays identically to the original game but with much improved visuals. The pre-rendered graphics and lighting effects are virtually photo realistic and look better than the 3D graphics in other pinball games. The graphics scale well too and it runs super smooth on my seven year old PC which has a first generation Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM and a HD5850 graphics card (a tip for people using low powered computers is switch the vsinc option off as this has a big hit on the frame rate).£10 for one table may not sound like good value but this table is such a gem it's worth every penny. There's more depth and replay value in this one table than there is in all of the Pinball FX and Pinball Arcade tables put together.The only minus point that I can think of is when I rotate my monitor by 90 degrees to play the game in portrait mode the screen has black borders at the top and bottom. Hopefully a future patch will sort this out so that I can play in full screen when the monitor is oriented vertically. Other than this minor issue there are no bugs in the game.10/10Just one more go...p.s. Empire Interactive please remake The Web or Big Race USA table next.

,Not Recommended,287900,34748210,Posted: 4 September,all,specialtyface,"Only one table, and I didn't like the table.Most of the ramps are narrow and placed far enough to the side that they're hard to shoot if you catch the ball and let it roll down the flipper. There are some classic pinballs where shooting ramps always requires momentum, but they usually have steeply sloped flippers so you're not screwed if you're playing from a standing start. This table tries to have the gently sloped flippers of a slower table and the ramps of a fast table and it feels poorly tuned as a result.The goal structure differs from your typical '90s Williams solid state in that it's unusually long and serial. There are lots of time periods to reach and each requires charging the time machine with several T2-esque ramp-to-ramp shots and then locking 3 balls for a multiball mode. Time periods are gated by collectible crystals so that you have to do them in order. Seeing all the content would require a really long play session. So I guess if you're so good that your ramp-to-ramp flow never falters and you get sick of running out of goals on other tables, this is for you.(BTW, the video mode is excellent)"

Then, after playing a gorgeous table and getting hypnotised by all the flashy lights, you get to find out that there is only ONE table and the game has no interest in telling you how to replay it after your first game over. Frustrating and minimalistic, this game is not for people who just want to play some ♥♥♥♥ing pinball to let off some ♥♥♥♥ing steam."

Here the reasons why:Everybody who reads my Google Plus - timeline on a daily basis, knows, that I totally love Pinball.I've been playing pinball all of my life, starting about 46 years ago with old fashioned electro- mechanic pinball machines. I've played nearly ALL pinball simulations that were available for any of my computers, tablets, smartphones and handheld consoles.I also own the original Pro Pinball- Timshock! that was released 1997.So i bought the new Pro Pinball Ultra Timshock! yesterday in hope of a great gaming experience, after the disaster that i had with ""Now Man's Sky"", but i was blown away - in a negative way.Here my issues:First i had to download about 1GB just to install the game. No problem so far. My Computer ( i7 3.4GHz, 32GB Ram, Geforce GTX680 2GB) runs a resolution of 2560x1440 natively. So i switched to that resolution inside of the game. What followed was a download of another 1.5GB  inside of the game and i could not even switch to another window to pass the time, because then the download simply holds! After the download finished i started the table.First i thought that the machine had crashed, because nothing seem to happen, but then i realized that a saw something more like a slideshow but not a game! So i decided to back out and change the resolution to 1080p and i had to wait again, because another 900MB had to download first.After i realized that even in 1080p the game does not react as quick and responsive as i liked it to, i decided that i'll tray to get a refund for Pro Pinball Ultra Timshock! This is a sad example on how to spoil an otherwise great game: Deliver a technical disaster."

So I was really happy when I found it here on steam. But, it has a BIG downside: HIDDEN DOWNLOADS!If you don't have a high-speed 100 Mbit/s connection, then don't go for this game.Seriously this crud must stop - it's as cancerous as EA's DLC policy.P.S.: Dear steam admins: If you could make dev's post the true data size, so that users with slow connections can see a no-no, that would be great!"

However I can only play it for a few seconds before my computer crashes... in that time, as i looked over the game I didn't see anything that was very interesting. The only thing i liked about the game is that it offers an option to play it at 2560 x 1440, so i can load it on my monitor in portrait style, which makes the play area a lot larger than on a landscape oriented monitor and so there is no need for the game to alter the perspective of the table as you play. This was the first pinball game I bought for the pc and thought that maybe my computer wasn't powerful enough to run pinball games but then i took a chance and bought a bunch of pinball games from pinball arcade and i was able to play for hours without a problem. I have a core i7 3.4 GHz cpu with a firepro v7900 video card. Based on the fact that i am not able to play the game for more than a few seconds, and what I did see while playing it wasn't interesting to me, I should probably give it a one star out of five, but since it has the option to play at 2560 x 1440, which is an excellent idea, I will give it a generous two stars...also if the game worked for more than a few seconds, it's possible I would have discovered more about the game that I liked."

,Recommended,287900,20812093,"Posted: 28 January, 2016",all,Patrick,"EDIT: Although the Kickstarter/Early access of this game was horrible (read below) the game looks great now it's finally released. It looks very polished and play's just like the old game. They also finally added all the table views from the original game, which is a big plus.If you have any interest in pinball simulations, I wouldn't hessitate to pick this up.Early Access review:This game is okay, but in the end was not worth the wait in it's current state.First of all, the Kickstarter for this game was a disaster. Their promise was that with the money earned by the Kickstarter, they would be able to speed up development. This was in the end of 2013. Yes, 2013. They promised it would be finished at the start of 2014. With barely any communication they just contineud to postpone the release without actually telling anyone about the progress of the game.Next, the optimisation is very bad. The game might look pretty, but does not run well at all on any standard gaming pc. Also the angles of the tables are not changeble. And now the UI is actually on top of the table, the table looks very small and is not comfortable to play on (for me at least).I hope they will still be able to improve and optimise performance of the game and also add the angles THE ORIGINAL GAME had. But with this slow progress, the game probably won't be out of 'early access' before 2020."
