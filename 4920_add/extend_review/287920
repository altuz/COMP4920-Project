76561197982148163,Recommended,287920,29588553,Posted: 30 January,all,Bravesteel,"I will preface this review with three questions, and if the answer is ""Yes"" to any of these questions then I suggest you give Mortal Online a long hard look; if you say ""Yes"" to all of these questions then stop reading this start downloading Mortal Online!--------------------Questions:1.  Are you tired and/or burnt out on all the MMORPGs out, or coming out, on the market?2.  Do you want to play a game where EVERYTHING you do is an accomplishment and reinvigorates that sense of discovery you had when you played your first MMORPG?3.  Does the idea of an open loot system (you lose everything you are carrying when you die) fill you with a sense of excitement and adventure?--------------------OverviewMortal Online is a Fantasy Sandbox MMORPG that takes familiar elements from games like Ultima Online and Runescape, and takes them to a whole new level.  The entire game is played in first-person, and there is no functionality to change the view to third-person.  All combat and actions within the game are based off of targeting with your reticle, so if you want to hit a boar in the head then you need to aim for it's head.  Character progression is based on skill points rather than levels, and you only have so many skill points to use.  You aren't safe anywhere, not even in cities, so always be on your guard, but don't turn into a jerk, just be wary.--------------------SkillsSkills are broken down into a ton of different categories that are based on Parent and Child relationships, so a player would need to learn Armor Crafting (to a certain skill level) before he/she can learn Soft Armor Crafting.  Many skills you can begin learning just by attempting to do them, such as chopping down a tree or mining for ore, but other skills will need to be learned by reading skill books.  Skill books can be obtained from Libraries (for a price) or from the Auction House, players can begin reading these (some can take 8 hours or more) and the reading timer will continue to countdown when the player logs off.I mentioned that you have a finite number of skill points to use, and in the beginning, you will burn through over half of these pretty quickly.  Don't panic!  You can lock skills that you don't want to increase anymore and you can even decrease skills you aren't going to use to get the skill points back to use on something else.  This can be confusing at first, but this really allows the player total freedom in choosing what their character does without letting characters become masters of everything at once.--------------------CombatCombat is based on using your aiming reticle and blocking or dodging the attacks of your enemies.  I haven't done much of this yet, besides slaughtering herds of innocent pigs, but I think it is very engaging, sort of a melding between Skyrim and Mount & Blade combat, but better.--------------------MagicNo comment at all on this, but it is very in depth, with required components for spells.  Healing magic, for instance, can require water.--------------------CraftingThe crafting in this game is intense.  I repeat: the crafting in this game is INTENSE.  There are spreadsheets and emulators online that help players calculate the required components to create other components to finally (maybe) create the item they want to create.  There is more than one way to make a particular piece of armor, and some components will make the end item heavier or cooler etc.  I think this is an amazing part of the game, but it is not for the faint of heart.--------------------PvPMortal Online works on a flagging system.  Here is the breakdown:Fledgling: YellowInnocent: BlueCriminal: GreyMurderer: RedHidden Criminal: Grey with Blue StripeBasically, if you do something negative to someone then you will be flagged Grey, unless that person was already Grey.  The flagging system is one of the most important parts of MO to understand, so check out this Beginner's Guide for more information :http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519329793.--------------------ConclusionMortal Online is a really in-depth game, but it is most certainly not for the casual player, and I don't mean the time-casual player, but the player that is more instant gratification.  If you want your cake and eat it too then this game is not for you, but if you want to bake your cake, eat some of your cake, then sneak around to hide your cake in the bank until you can share it with your guild mates then this game is for you!You can try the game for free, and all F2P Accounts can use skills up to skill level 60.  What that means is that you can raise your skills above skill level 60, but you can only use the skill at skill level 60.  I highly recommend subscribing to the game if you are 8 hours in and enjoying it.  The subscription costs less than other MMORPGs, and it is well worth it to support such an awesome game.--------------------Grimstein's Personal Tips1.  Buy the Reading Skill Book (yes, that's an actual skill book) and begin reading that right away.  That will allow you to read other skill books more efficiently.2.  Find a Guild on the official MO forums.3.  Get out of the starting city.4.  Turn up your graphics and other options as high as you can.5.  Only keep what you immediately need on you.  Bank your money until you need to buy something, and keep your skill books in the bank until you want to start reading them.6.  If you are going on a long journey, such as to join up with your new guild, bring along some food and bring everything you can with you.  Banks are localized, and if you store something in Tindrem, you will have to go back to Tindrem to get it.--------------------I hope my review helped you make an informed decision.  There is so much more to Mortal Online than I touched upon in this review, but I hope it gives you a taste of what's in store if you play.  Good luck, and I hope to see you in Nave!Evris Grimstein"

There are no quests. You are dropped in a world and you make of it what you can. The crafting is amazing. The comunity controls the economy and the weapons you have access to. I have been playing for a week now and I've barely scratched the surface. It took me 3 days just to get comfortable enough to leave town.I was so sick of every MMO out there being the same. You quest, quest, and quest some more. It is boring. There is no danger anymore.EVERYTHING in this game feels dangerous; Like a challenge. If you go out with a friend it legitamtely feels like an adventure and it may take you hours or even days to find your way back to town if you are new and you get lost in the wilderness.10/10, guys. Please keep it up. This is what an MMO should feel like when you play it."
,Recommended,287920,29623140,Posted: 1 February,all,SLLLRPPP,This is a truly amazing game. You will die and you will lose stuff but as you learn the game you will die less and make more. you just got to remember to only travel and carry things you can replace. alot of people who try the game never leave the starter town. they die and quit. its not a easy game. the world is massive and has loads of places to explore and you can have Player to player experiences like no other game.look for a guild. the game doesnt just tell you were to get things. joining a guild is a great way to get knowledge from other players and become viable to defend yourself and make things for yourself sooner.10/10 the greatest MMO ive played. i have way more hours in this game than steam says as i rarely play it with steam open or even use steam and have played it for years before it was on steam. there is bi-weekly bug fixes and it has some of the friendliest Devs ive seen in a gamethe Lead Programmer Sebastian is The Mangive it a try and dont just stay in the first town. explore naked. visit towns. talk to people. dont let the griefers and player killers get you down. skill up join people and practice so you can avoid and kill them.

If you havent found a guild by then you could always try the forums, Which also have all the guides you neeed for pretty much everything.I wouldnt suggest taking advice for anyone who hasnt played this game longer then a few 100 hours because you acutally need to spend 100 hours just on learning the basics of how this game works, even with that said it's not as complex as I make it out to be, it's just the newer generation of people don't tend to understand games like this."

(I've been playing this game for over 5 years now, so I have many more hours than what steam shows)This game is NOT perfect.There are bugs (very few and usually not major), there are griefers, there is heartache and pain in this game.However, this game provides something that no other game I have found has EVER done before. It gave me FREEDOM, to do whatever I wanted, how I wanted, and when I wanted. This game doesn't hold you by the hand, most people never leave tindrem before they quit and so they don't get to experience the true beauty of this game, that of adventure, friends, and money.I quit this game 2-4 times before I ever left tindrem, but when I did, when I finally understood what I wanted to do in this game and with the resources provided by the community on mining, extracting, farming etc.. I was able to accomplish my goal and become a trader and craftsmen in this game. Yes, getting ganked and losing a months worth of gold is a terrible feeling, but what doens't kill you makes you stronger and if you keep at it you will only get better.I feel like this is already too long, so to cut it short, this game is NOT perfect NO game is, but the freedom of choice that it offers makes this game beautiful and if you truly get into it and give it a chance you will see that it is probably one of the best games you will ever play."
,Recommended,287920,29794693,Posted: 8 February,all,Deadbeat Dad,"This game is one of the most in depth i've ever played. The community controls nearly every aspect of the game world asside from developement, There are politics and wars against guilds, betrayals umong alliances, A feeling od deep satisfaction when you win a fight against another player because this game is completely skill based. Dont think that because you're good at pvp in some other popular mmos *Cough* WoW *cough* that you're going to be anything but terrible in this one. It matters what direction you swing your sword and what direction you block. It matter where you hit your opponent on their body.This game has the most in-depth craftin gsystem i've ever seen on any ""MMO"". Name a matrial that you could harvest from a corpse... you can make armor or weapons from it... including skin from people you slay. You can also eat practically anything that comes from a corpse including player heads and corpses, though it'll probably make your character sick. Give it a try. if you hate it, delete it. But at least put more than 5 hours into it before you give it a bad rating just because you dont understand this incredibly in depth, rewarding game."
,Recommended,287920,29905162,Posted: 13 February,all,Bler,"I have a number more of logged hours than what steam can give me credit for but here is the thing. Mortal Online, while old and dated when it comes to the graphics has a lot of features that unfortunately not adopted by the MMO genre. There is a need to establish relationships and a lot of opportunities to help your fellow gamer. I get a lot of joy out of showing newer people the ropes of the game in hopes that they too enjoy the game as much as I do. The combat is fun and challenging especially when fighting other players, the crafting and gathering is insanely deep and involved. The game is 7 years old and still running even with its small community and I think that says something people should consider.If you miss the old days where you could create relationships with new people rather than hitting the queue button over and over this might be the game for you, if you want to look me up feel free to do so I am always looking to help others and show people the ropes. I'd recommend this if you are looking for a change of pace from the homogenized norm that is MMO's today."

76561198065802651,Recommended,287920,29532762,Posted: 27 January,all,Birb is the worw,"I'm going to keep it simple for people to follow. In this games current state I was just unable to play it. And I'm going to explain why in the classic Pros And Cons format. So let's start with the pros.+The game is clearly similar to ArcheAge where it's objective is to give the player as much freedom as possible. That includes professions, building houses, BUILDING KINGDOMS and rallying with other players. Not enough online games do this and it's instantly won my favor for this alone.+ There's actual nudity. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Definitely didn't see this coming from a Free To Play game. In fact it gives you the option to toggle it in the preferences menu. This game isn't rated PG as far as I'm aware and I'm sure there's probably a sex scene somewhere in here too.+The character customization is basic however kinda detailed. You know how in GTA Online it has you pick a mother and a father for your base character generation? This game has something similar except it generates your base stats and race. I thought that was pretty cool and worth mentioning here.Now for the cons. And if you've noticed, I only mentioned three pros. I'll explain why later.-In order to play this game at a playable framerate I actually had to turn all settings down in the pop-up menu. The first time I played the game the framerate was genuinely abysmal. I thought I wasn't even going to get as far as the tutorial. This isn't right though since my PC has enough power to run Crysis at a playable speed which is a game known for pouring 90% of it's money into the graphics. (Still a good game tho.) So essentially you need a super computer to play with decent graphics. Hope that Youtube careers working out for you, Youtubers.-The combat is... bad. Not bad in a way as when you attack someone you have to deal with a cool down on all abilities or anything giving the enemy ample time to hit you. It's like Skyrim's melee system only done poorly. I don't even know about the magic or ranged system.-And here's why I only mentioned 3 pros. The game is honestly kind of bland. Not bland in like a Runescape sort of way where everything from the graphics to the gameplay is trying to get you to stop playing the game. I mean it's bland in a way that dissolves my interest to continue playing it. Obviously the games set in a gritty Witcher-esque world considering you encounter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters in the tutorial right along side discovering this game features nudity, which under different circumstances would rope me right in to continue playing. But the problem here is that it was obviously developed by devs who probably haven't worked on an MMO before. You can tell just from looking at the detail of the tutorial stage. It's way to open and the tutorial ASSAULTS you. It doesn't really do a good job explaining things either. It pretty much just gives you the basics, pats you on the butt then expects you to figure things out from there.Do I reccomend the game? Maybe not in it's current state but definitely as a game in itself. I genuinely wanna come back to this game once things have been sorted out and it stops being clunky and forcing me to look into a bland mess of a tutorial. I want to play this game once it's more able to handle hightened graphics and I want to see what it could turn into. It's very, VERY rare for an MMO to give you as much freedom as to see people naked which is why even known it my experience was kind of a mess I WANT this game to do good which is why it's getting a thumbs up from me.Here's hoping this game goes places...EDITSo I tried playing it again and I missed a few things.+I love the Oblivion approach they took to the stats system where doing things like simply running will increase your speed and endurance. That was really neat-The community is awful. While I was trying to grind walkers in the graveyard there was an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clipping into an enemy I was attacking trying to get me to hit him. And I did. And then he killed me. In town. Alright I'm going to get this right out of the way and say THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN SOLVED. Simply just dedicate a server to PVE where you can't damage fellow players and dedicate another to PVP where you can. That way when an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ player clips into an enemy I'm attacking I don't accidentally hit him. And nobody will be able to attack me. I get that their trying to make a game maybe similar to ARK or something but... no actually no I'm not forgiving this. If this game doesn't have dedicated servers for different types of vs then I'm never playing it again.Do I still reccomend the game? Yes. But I ain't playing it anytime soon unless these issues are solved."

If you want depth, freedom and complexity in a truly hardcore and unforgiving world, there isn’t another title out there like it that I know of.My hours played here on Steam may be few, but that's because I've only recently switched to playing the game through Steam instead of the old launcher. I first played this game way back in 2010 then left for the most part, until September 2013 when I returned for good and have been playing it ever since as my preferred MMORPG over all others.At first glance, this game may not seem like much, but once you’ve earned a decent amount of gold, crafted a set of gear for yourself, made a few friends and seen the world outside Tindrem city, you begin to appreciate just how vast and intricate this game really is. Then you realise that you’ve only just scratched the surface; there is the player-driven economy, guilds and individual players going about their business, and much more.You can be any character you want, and pursue whatever activity you wish. If you’ve ever played The Elder Scrolls or Ultima Online, you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. There are no traditional quest hubs that have you moving from one region to the next as you level up. There are, however, plenty of players who may have something that needs done or need help with, and if you’re interested then you can lend your services and make your mark in the world in a meaningful way. That is just one of the myriad of ways you can keep yourself busy and occupied, all it takes is a little imagination and creative thinking. Even after playing this game for over three years, every time I login there is always something for me to do.I could keep writing a long review but it would probably be best if I said that this game is not for the faint-hearted or those who don’t know how a sandbox game is meant to be played. If you’ve never seen this game in all its glory, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.

Quick words of advice: YOU WONT ALWAYS RUN THAT SLOW, FINISH THE TUTORIAL, READ THE BULLETINS IN THE HELP TAB, READ BOOKS, LOOK UP GUIDES AND BUILDS, JOIN A GUILD TO MEET PEOPLE, DONT ATTACK THE GREY GUY, IF YOU DIE DONT USE THE NEAREST PRIEST BUTTON, RUN TO ONE OF THE RED BEAMS IN THE SKY, TRUST NO ONE, IF YOU DIE, KNOW THAT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IS REPLACEABLE.

I started the game with a friend that had been playing for 2 week and that sure did make the start to the game more enjoyable due to the very small tutorial. After that you start your adventures trying to figure out your way and understand the skill system but after that I can say this game has so much depth and replay value. I spent my first week killing Springboks and Urials to further my combat skills and to help me understand the blocking and parry system.With the 1100 points you are given to spend on skills you can only Max skills to 60 and not to 100 as a F2P account which is understandable because they need to give a reason for players to want to SUB to the game. It was no secret to the folks  watching my stream that within the first 2 days I was going to become a SUB and continue my adventures. Also I would like to add this is not a dead game at all there is plenty of players and furthermore in the last 3 weeks they have put in 2 large Patches to improve the game.Thanks for this game and TAKE MY MONEY !!!

If you're a fan of the elder scrolls series then you would love this game. From crafting, building, territory control to fishing, alchemy and plenty more to do. Normally in MMOs you feel some sort of accomplishments for winning a pvp fight but in MO the pvp is really intense and keeps you on your toes. The game is full loot but it's not as harsh as people claim it to be since you can easily re-gear and come back for more. I've been playing this game for a long time and I still am. The GMs have been doing pretty damn well with the latest patches. You can play as a foot fighter, mage, mounted combat or even have necromancy summons at your disposal. Plenty of weapons to choose from whatever you are comfortable with. I can go on and on how much fun this game is but I'll leave my review the way I started it: The best of its genre."

It is a lot of things... good, bad, and down right frustrating, it can be one of the best times you have had and one of the most mind numbingly boring times.   But overall it is a really decent open world sandbox.I have played Mortal Online off and on since Block B of beta, I can say that the 1300+ hours of gameplay recorded by Steam is no where near the amount of time I have in this game.  While I would not call it a gem, it is a real find, and the original open world sandbox first person PVP full loot game.  It came out in a time when everyone was terrified of doing something different, a small group of mostly incompetent coders got together and formed Star Vault and created Mortal Online.   Which for the first year was absolute crap as SV worked tirelessly to fix the millions of problems the game had.   After 7+ years they have about 900k of those problems fixed and the game works 95% of the time.   Which is better than most games on STEAM.....    The community is mildly toxic, very PVP oriented, and not affraid of telling you where to shove it if you annoying them.Overall Mortal Online is at the very least worth the download and free to play perma-trial time.  Who knows you may like it... but if you dont, its free.HodoAegis Imperium."

A true sandbox for an MMO, and the most immersive game i've played. It has a STEEP learning curve but that's what makes it great, it is not an easy game.No levels, just a skillpool you decide how to use and the forced first person was jarring at first but it really adds to immersion and now I can't live without it.The game does have it quirks but its much like the Elder Scrolls series in that it comes with the territory. If you like the elder scrolls and can handle the hardcore nature, you will love this game.It can be harsh and can be frustrating but is more so rewarding and fun overcoming challenges. I've played many MMOs and this game offers a unique experience that can't be replicated."

You can build house then any kind of structures like crafting tables, walls, and NPC guards. You also can siege and destroy structures and houses! Siege system requires logisitic to success. Magic system is good, abit of to much fantasy. Mounted system has a big advantage in battlefield, it does need to fixed some ways like no stam drain while go up the hill, its just lame sometime to fight mounted as foot. Other than that, foot vs foot combat is fun and armor system is great and doing well with stam drain based on armor weight. I enjoy playing Mortal Online, because it always change everyday even when I dont play for few days, alot of things happens! Roam for pvp is somewhat boring because of walls however still get pvp activities daily basis. Crafting system is nice, so many options! Go for it, go play Mortal Online. Don't cry if you lose everything because I have lose a lot more!"

Kind of the only reason i play this over other titles of the same concept is because there is no other game like this ya sure some MMO have full loot and are PVP based but nothing like this game.Also 50% of the community kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i mean this is a FULL LOOT PVP HARDCORE MMO and people give me death threats when i kill them and take there gear i even had someone threaten to report me to get me banned well not banned yet so that good. I've also been kicked out of help chat with new toons for PKing cause i'll kill some noob players who will then all cry in help chat about it which i'll be in an see i'll reply with it how the game is ment to be played get over it and in the end they don't get over it so i'll get 30 kids crying about how i PKed them in help chat so rather then ban 30 people actting like babies in help chat the deves just ban me cause it easier. Can't blame them for it but now the cry babies lose out on good edvice sense they get all the experienced players banned from help chat cause they can't handle being killed in again a FULL LOOT PVP HARDCORE MMO.Best by far is when i walked up to some kid my guild just wrecked in a Guild vs Guild PVP war and said GF and was give the reply go ♥♥♥♥ing kill your self you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ like wow ok calm down it just a game.

Even then - the skill system is annoying and overly-complicated and really promotes alts. Guess what? Extra character slots? Pull out that sweet, sweet plastic.I really do believe the devs of this game are trying their best with what they have and it's really sad the only thing holding this game back is a severe lack of population. The game-world is simply dead... You can travel from city-to-city and not even encounter an NPC. It's almost depressing. You can tell the devs intended for non-existent players to fill up all this empty space."
76561198052476626,Not Recommended,287920,29853244,Posted: 11 February,all,Fitzy,"Good idea, very badly implemented,  I'm not usually one to highlight poor graphics in game but these take the♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the game just takes the♥♥♥♥♥♥ especially the amounts your asked to pay in order to be able to do anything. Seriously? the devs think that paying over and above the price of a AAA game is fair for this, yet they are very quick to talk about ""how they are a small company"" when it suits...Nothing difficult or challenging about the game but an awful lot of pointless frustrations and bugs make the experience totally unenjoyable.I wouldn't describe the game as ""F2p"" you get an trial with limited skills, this is fair enough right?Normally yeah but you litterally cannot do anything with the skills you have available, want to craft weapons? well you can craft a certain type of weapon at a skill cap, trying to explore the crafting system and advancing the skills, still unable to make anything better than the initial ""worn short sword"" that you get, simply because of the skill caps, It should be advertised as a limited trial because that's what it is, if you've more money than sense, then dive right in, the devs will love you.Such a long boring grind to collect materials, to extract a material from that, in order to extract another material from that in order to, well you get the idea, but at each step you need more skill points in order to extract the next material in ever decreasing amounts. The skills race up the way very quickly, an hour or so had me at max atributes, good right? well no, totally nothing to work towards except a massive load of material gathering only to find out that you need not have bothered. You're still unable to make anything better than the rags and short sword you're able to make, unless you've got a few toons.In order to make iron, you need to mine ore, turn that ore into something, turn what you get from that into something else, each time using a catalyst that makes no sense putting water directly into a forge for example, you just don't do it, water puts fire OUT, totally unintuative. then once you've got all of that you need to mix it in with more of the ore that you got all of that stuff from. And if you're able to do that with your one free toon then THAT IS ALL YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO and you won't be able to do it to any extent hat can get you anywhere in the game.It's not even a good mining and wood cutting simulator.Let's try combat, one of the poorest AI's I have ever encountered, some mobs will happily stand and let you swing at their head, others will run past several players and attack you for no reason, you can add people to your friends list but there is no way to productively play with them as far as I can tell because anytime you try to help them fight something your weapons auto sheathe and you get the message ""You cannot attack an innocent player, please click""Awesome eh? you try to help your friend and end up standing in the middle of battle with no weapon drawn, it's THAT poorly thought out.So still thinking that the concept of the game is a good one, you look into the subscription options, you figure, ok it's free, you need to subscribe to get the most.This is also the worst subscription plan I've ever encountered in a few of decades of gaming,When you subscribe you get access to stealing and to more skill points, also the cap is removed and you can go up to 100, well that's all you get, no extra character slots, ""stealing"" basically you are untouchable, you can outrun any free player, you can outrun the guards, the only warning you get when you're being stolen from is a text message in a chat flooded with spam.So you pay your £10 a month sub and you can finally maybe do one thing to a decent skill level, you then have to buy more character slots, if you don't want to be this guy who just stands in the one spot click a button repeatedly.So for example you wanted a crafter to suport your fighter, that's £40 right out of the bat, not counting that you need to keep paying the monthly sub. Why £40? Well you need your fighter toon, your armour toon, your weaponsmith toon AND your materiel harvesting toon, allthough you will probably need two of those due to the uninspired crafting, they've tried to make it ""interesting"" it's not, most of it's pointless, all of it is unintuitive.So that's £160 just for your years sub and character slots, to maybe be able to do something effectively in the game.Not only that but it's the same for anyone you want to play with.Do the devs HONESTLY think that's a fair price for what you get for it? well apparently, the ususal stuff about ""small companies"" etc, Well hows about these ""small companies"" only take on what they can afford rather than passing the cost onto the ever decreasing player numbers?How about they actually have a long good look at themselves and what they are asking people to play because for that money, I could buy a holiday in Sweden, never mind play a very poorly executed game from there.The information about all of this is very limited as well, you go onto their wiki for information about a book and the wiki simply says the same text as the book does,The only good thing I have to say about the game was how quickly a GM responded to a ""stuck"" request, it's totally possible to walk through the side of a bridge and fall into water that you can't get out of, even if you did have the skill points to put in swimming.This is only one of many, many bugs and glitches that I have encountered in just a short while, I've had expensive skill books simply ""stop reading"" and vanish, I've had skill points dissapear, items dissapear, 400 skill points vanished over night, can't even be bothered opening a ticket about it, the game is just that poor."
,Not Recommended,287920,29449171,Posted: 23 January,all,[1st TX.H] Pvt. Price.,"Initially, the game concept appears to sound like a cross between skyrim and Mount & Blade, but it stops after you complete the tutorial area. At the very instant you finish the tutorial you are introduced to the wide open world that is known as Mortal Online.Firstly it is worth mentioning that there is a small group of players that sit outside the gates of the tutorial city waiting for new, ill-equipped players to appear so they can gang up on you, overwhelm, and kill you within seconds. I did not discover this from experience as much as I had people scream at me not to exit the city because apparently a clan regularly camps the ""noob city""The community is helpful but at the same time rude and completely annoying. When I logged in the first thing I saw in the chatbox was about 6 people comparing the size of their character's junk, but we'll get onto that later. If you ever have the displeasure of hearing the barely functional speech option in the game, and manage to understand anything in the game aside from static, you will realize most of the players who are on this game are 12 years old or younger. Trust me, adults don't speak like the cast of Sesame street normally.On to the real deal, game mechanics. It's a weird puzzle of interesting concepts that are executed in horrible ways. The game uses the unreal engine, which has given us rather excellent looking games such as Red Orchestra 2 and Killing Floor, among many others. Unfortunately, the graphics in this game are far more akin to one of the games I compare it to, Mount and Blade, but lack all the features that make Mount and Blade interesting. The game's combat mechanics are more similar to Chivalry and Mount and Blade, but unlike both of those games, come off as clunky and broken in many cases, with the so-called emphasis on enemy weak points being completely pointless because striking the head of the enemy always does the most damage anyway. But this is a MMORPG, surely there are better features in it than just the combat and graphics? The game has interesting movement animations, and is completely in first person, but not immersive enough to become interesting. Permadeath isn't actually permadeath, it's just generalized respawn timers and a ""spirit realm"" that offers absolutely nothing to do while you wait.How do you die? well that's simple. Steal in front of a guard and he instantly hits you with a lightning bolt which will kill you no matter what you have. I tested this theory by grinding undead corpse heads until I had the best armor available, and he still kills you in 2 hits. He hits instantly, and there is no way of blocking magic explained in the tutorial.RPG mechanics? You learn new skills by reading books, they give you a starter book to read after you finish the tutorial. It takes 6 days real time to read the book, and there is no way of speeding up the process. There are features that are locked including max skills for ""paying"" players.I left the game before even trying to do real PvP because the PvE in the game was already so horrifyingly bad that it felt appropriate to quit.Never play this game, leave it to be one of the dead MMORPG games that fade into obscurity like the cancer they are."
