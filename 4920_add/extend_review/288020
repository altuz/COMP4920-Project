,Recommended,288020,11647918,"Posted: 10 August, 2014",all,coldfrog,"I am going to recommend this, but with some mild hesitation.First things first, it really captures the retro style, feeling a little mega man, a little Super Metroid, and a little Cave Story (I mean, you have to make it somewhat modern, right?)  If this appeals to you, you are probably about sold, but just let me continue.If you are familiar with the way Capcom retreaded the NES style Mega Man series, you might be aware that it included more instant death traps than any game previously.  Well, this game is filled with those things as well, and you'll be quite aware of that by the time you start getting into the depths that this game offers.  Because this game is harder than any of the games I've mentioned so far.  And you know what, maybe that's your thing.  Frankly, I'm OK with that.  The nice thing is that the game takes advantage of years of experience to know what kind of classic mistakes that old games can...  Oh, what, there's a lives system?  Well then.In truth, the lives are not as bad as it seems.  You can die several times but when you run out, it's not start-over game over.  In fact, you end up in a room, progress saved, but you will have to find your way back to your last location.  This is not necessarily an enormous detriment...  except it is VERY spare on teleport locations, and some parts of the game...  you are going to die plenty.  This can lead to rather a few revisits to rooms that probably killed you a couple times as well. If you haven't stocked up enough lives, you might be in pretty big trouble. I will say this to their benefit, though: there are many rooms where you can flick a switch to remove an energy barrier that lets you take a shortcut through the room to skip parts of it, but even then you'd still have to make your way through some tricky bits.  I don't even want to think about how many times I died in some sections so far, and I'm about 2/3s of the way through.The thing is though, these levels are quite well designed.  I feel like a connoiseur of platformers would be able to appreciate this, but unless you are a master, you have to be prepared for grinding through some particularly nasty bits to get further.So basically, if you have not been frightened away by this idea, and possibly if you don't get frustrated easily, give this a go.I should also note, great visual assets and a wonderful soundtrack.  If that pushes you over the edge, great, but if not, don't say I didn't warn you ;)"

This however is just a gamplay feature, it's meant to be hard and it's meant to kill you over and over again until you learn to fight them properly or just get lucky.The game plays like the classic games of the gameboy era, with the simple run and shoot mechanics, paired with things like wall jumping and secondary weapons. Really a treat to play.I give this game a solid 9/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a challenging, if nostalgic game."

,Recommended,288020,11571106,"Posted: 5 August, 2014",all,mrfurious,"It's basically: Metroid, Mega Man, and Cave Story. It is screen-punchingly hard, but also extremely compelling, and you'll be trying ""one more time"" over and over.One bad part is the lives counter (20 lives). It's always pretty easy to get back to where you were so the consequence for losing all 20 lives is pretty minimal, but it doesn't add anything to the game other than frustration.The game is too frugal with it's teleporters, so you'll traverse a long way to a boss, only to get killed (it takes a while to learn their patterns) and then you'll need to work your way back. I recommend going to your Users/[your username here]/AppData/Local/Rex Rocket/ and creating copies of the save files just after you've gotten to the Boss area. This way you'll be able to reload just before the bosses. And trust me..you'll need to.I strongly recommend using a controller as others have suggested. I also strongly recommend going to the game options to change directional control from the analog stick to the D-pad."

It has great game mechanics such as shooting below you to boost jumps and teleportation, and is slightly less edicting than cocane, however like the games it has fuse together, it is very difficult. When you first start, you will probably die quite a bit, but once you get used to the game, it gets signifigantly easier. The boss fights are set up so that you will have to play them a few times to beat them, also, this is NOT a game for minimalists. If you don't explore for health, lives, and upgrades, the game gets really hard really fast. Furthermore, you should probably play this on a controller, as the keyboard controls are a bit clunky.Should you buy this game? Yes, it is well worth $10, and if you ever see it on sale, you would be an idiot to not buy this game."
,Recommended,288020,11568350,"Posted: 5 August, 2014",all,shoggofu,"I was looking forward to playing this game. After 2 hours of game-time I had progressed 13% through the game.- fun game- but WAAAY harder than I expectedhttp://youtu.be/ToPAMc1uBwYhttp://youtu.be/3rKicf2ygloSo the first 15-20 minutes was pretty easy because there wasn't really much combat. However once I got to the first boss I started to die a LOT. You start with a lot of lives, I think that is reason. In the options menu you are supposed to be able toggle 'fun mode' on and off. I think that might have actually meant hardcore mode, but this feature seemed to be broken as as there was no apply setting button and it was always back on when I returned to the menu if I'd toggled it off. The boss spammed out a lot of projectiles which I found really tricky to avoid. I think I died at least 15-20 times trying to beat it. The environment is populated by a large amount of enemies. Sometimes it's difficult to get past them with without taking damage i.e. sometimes you don't have much choice but to jump into them. They tend to surround you and appear unexpectedly when you are distracted by other hazards. Also enemies appear to have some degree of random generation so you don't always encounter the same enemies in the same place. I think that probably help keep the same areas fresh.You don't re-spawn in the immediate vicinity are after dying instead you are taken back to a checkpoint, which there aren't that many of. This tends to set you back pretty far. So I found that I had to begin the same gauntlets from the start again and again. Sometimes after dying over and over before finally making it through sections I discovered that I'd just went to all the effort only to take me back somewhere that I had already been to! So make sure you check the map system so that you're not just taking alternative routes backwards. Also there are hidden passages and destroyable blocks which will uncover shortcuts that dramatically reduce the effort needed to navigate the ship, so be on the lookout for them. I wish I'd realized these things earlier.I liked how the game looked. The aesthetics and sound effects remind me of lot of old console and PC games and brought back happy memories. For example I hadn't thought about ID's Dangerous Dave for a long time before playing this. That game was awesome! NPCs in Rex Rocket have little bit's of dialogue, some of which I found amusing.So in the time that I played I felt that I only progressed a relatively small amount through the game. It was very difficult and I was having to make numerous attempts to complete small sections of the game. I struggled to reach points only to die at them and have to go back. This has potential for frustration (I’ll admit I did gripe about it lol) but surprisingly I still found that I enjoyed playing this game.Clickherefor my YouTube gaming channel"

,Not Recommended,288020,20392457,"Posted: 8 January, 2016",all,Bubberducky,"During the Steam Winter Sale, I happened upon this game in my discovery queue. A fan of hard platformers (Bionic Commando, Castlevania, Contra, Mega Man, Super Meat Boy), I believed it to be a good idea to go ahead and make the purchase.I've played it for a little less than an hour. The platforming is slippery, the enemies are either overpowered or in such large numbers as to be overwhelming, the jumping is floaty. Nothing that hasn't been written before. However...All of those games I had listed before shared the same difficulty curve as Rex Rocket. The only difference being, if I had died and lost a life in those other games, it was my fault. Playing the game over and over again lead to developing the techniques needed to beat the game. Platform technique memorization in a game like the first Castlevania was not only encouraged, but absolutely necessary. Point being, if you lost a life, it was your fault. Hard, but not unfair, and this type of development, getting into the game's world and learning the facets of it, is why I love the genre.This game isn't like that. Within this last hour, I found myself struggling to avoid screaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at my monitor. Traps, spike pits, acid pools, repeated dialogue during boss fights, and randomly-placed enemies with no indications as to where they will appear do not good game design make.The difficulty, when coupled with the controls and enemy placement (as well as other mechanics)  are completely crippling to the fun factor of this game, making it feel like a chore to play. Instead of continuing after I lose a life, I just feel like quitting. Woe betide those who buy this game, expecting a return to retreux-styled glory, for you will only be met with disappointment."

Upon waking up from a Cryogenic sleep you are told you are to save the ship and everyone from the threat that has come on board. Fight Mechs such as Crusher Bot Commando- Bot and many more.This is a game that has some very funny dialogue and great controls. The style of graphics while 8 Bit are beautiful and colorful. I would slate this game as possibly one of the most underated games on Steam as an Indie Based game. Almost above my favorite Indie game of all time Nihilumbra. Beautiful Job Castle Pixel..

Most of the negative reviews complain about the extreme difficulty, but compared to games like Wings of Vi, They Bleed Pixels or Super Meat Boy (100% run), the difficulty level is actually much lower.If you're a fan of 2D platformers, you should definitely give this game a try, you won't be disappointed."
,Recommended,288020,11611345,"Posted: 9 August, 2014",all,CJ The Expert,"Let me preface what is going to end up a rather nit-picky and negative review by saying that I LOVE this game. It looks absolutely beautiful, the music is great, and I have had fun playing it. It does remind me a lot of the older metroid games, a very good thing. Sidescrolling metroid was the best. I will definitely be going back to finish this game if it kills my fingers. Certainly worth the money if you love platforms or happen to be a masochist. Then there's the ""but..."" part.The most irritating issue I have is that of the 2 and half hours I have played so far, I have spent maybe a thrid of it waiting. Waiting for a platform to move back towards me, waiting for a block that fades in, and then back out. Maybe waiting on a moving platform for the platform and the fading block to match up. That gets agonizing. In addition to that, I activated 2 of the ""warp points"" in the first 30, maybe 45 minutes. After that, nothing. If I get a game over, I have to run from that second warp points to where I died. More time that I'm spending jumping jumps that I've not only already done, but that I've already done 10, 15 times. Often, I fail these jumps, not even reaching the end. Shooting the same enemies in the same patterns. Did I mention there were enemies? They're not really important. You do have health, but I have found that even if I do take a few hits, it's either missing a jump, or getting my jump interupted by an enemy or an attack, and subsequently falling into green insta-killing goo, that kills me. Bosses aside, I can't think of one time where an enemy killed me with an attack, leaving the enemies to fade into the background. I noticed myself even writing them off unless they were between me and a jump. I wasn't afraid of them. They were no threat. If you're gonna give me HP, I'd prefer if it worked either as a LoZ type thing where falling takes some of it away, moving me back to, say, the room entrance, or more of a mario-esque style where any enemy attack kills me and there's no HP at all. The way it is, falling is such an extreme danger compared to the enemies that they are overshadowed.Another quick thing to mention is the energy bit things. The game explains quite nicely that if you collect 100 of them, you get an extra life, and that large containers of 100 can also be found. This led me to believe that the little bits would be scattered about, dropped by enemies, etc. The complete opposite ended up being true. Occasionally I would see an enemy drop one or two, but they always end up in the goo where I couldn't get to it. Some rooms would have 5 or 6 floating over platforms, but that was the exception, not the rule. I found that the containers were treated like collectibles, or upgrades, stashed away in spots where I would likely lose a life just getting there or back, and so I wrote them off too. It was too much risk for the reward. Once again, a large part of the game was lost, consumed by the platforming, draining away the cool things that are amazing to prioritize something frustrating and constant.The bosses were tons of fun. Hard as all ♥♥♥♥, but fun. A decent reward for completing all the platforming leading up to them, and, at least in the two that I've fought already, I never felt like I couldn't win that time, or dodge that attack, which is a good thing.I'll probably update this as I go further in the game, maybe some of these things get better. Or I'm an idiot and missing something. Right now, though?Solid 8/10"

For me this game came out of nowhere, I just happened to see it as a new release on steam and was instantly drawn in by the trailer.  After playing through the game I can say that the game certainly is as awesome as the trailer makes it look, it was also much more challenging than the trailer made it look.The soundtrack is amazing and almost all tracks in the game are memorable. It's good enough that I'd pay extra money if the mp3's were offered as DLC.The pixel art  is very well done has a retro feel, while also providing a high amount of detail in the backgrounds, Particle effects, and animation.The boss fights are megaman style, most are very challenging to beat the first time you fight them, but become easy to defeat after you learn thier patterns. Also again like megaman you get a weapon or skill after defeating each boss which makes defeating them feel more rewarding.The level design is great, and the game consistently offers challenging platforming that makes you uses all abilities at your dispoal to get through, my favorite being shooting a charge shot straight down to use as a makeshift double jump. The controls are spot on, most deaths are the result of your own mistakes (or really enemies that are being really mean). The ship is also full of secret collectibles to hunt down, be they behind hidden walls or in hard to reach places, it demands a lot of exploration to find all of them.I reccomend this game to anyone looking for a challenging retro style Metroid-like, I've never seen the concept done as well as this in an indie game. Make sure you are prepared for a challenge before buying the game though, as you will likely die many times before completing it."

So if you even intend on buying this game... you better grow a pair before you even attempt this game... cuz ur gonna die alot.There is one questionable optional powerup that felt rather too hard (Even for this game) to get due to a platform issue. This powerup is the Grenade Launcher. Granted that I got the power-up through several tries, I died many times due to the platforms that move, and when you tap (not hold) left or right, Rex shifts the opposite direction which is annoying due to spikes being everywhere on this part.

76561198004565666,Recommended,288020,32032843,Posted: 28 May,all,brickey.8,"A very well-made platformer. The game gives you lots of different guns and tools (which feel pretty varied) and expects you to use all of them if you want to win. The action is pretty solid, the platforming is extremely solid, and the boss designs are excellent. (My favorite boss is a human-sized opponent that constantly teleports around a room where the only ground are slowly rotating patforms, and mostly attacks as he comes out of a teleport). Music and visuals are also pretty solid.This game is very hard and unforgiving of mistakes. Enemies and bosses do a ton of damage with every hit, and usually one slip-up in a platforming area will insta-kill you. Checkpoints are mercifully frequent, but you can forget about doing the game in one continue (and thus should pretty much ignore the lives). And if you aren't really good any one of the bosses might be a brick wall.My only real complaint is the controls jump (though general controls are pretty tight). You can extend your jump by firing your gun downwards and double-jump by firing a charge shot downwards, in addition to a regular double-jump and a walljump. That means complicated platforming sections require doing way too many things at once--you have to double jump and wall-jump while holding down+attack, releasing attack to do another double jump and then immediately press+hold attack again to charge another shot. It's way too easy to do the wrong thing with the wrong button. It also means hitting enemies at the peak of your triple jump is tedious, since you need a fully charged shot just to hit them with 1-2 normal shots.If you're ok (or happy) with extremely high difficulty, and willing to overlook the complicated jumping controls, I'd highly recommend this game."

,Recommended,288020,17888256,"Posted: 4 September, 2015",all,Cyril,"Overall, a pretty great platformer metroidvania! The controls are tight and responsive, the movement powerups are pretty cool - shooting to fall slower, charge shots used as double jump, an actual double jump, and dash altogether, the game's difficulty is overall pretty tough but the hardest parts are sidelined to optional stuff, the bosses are fantastic, the game looks pretty good and the soundtrack is pretty good, the backstory's fairly interesting and there's a decent bit of worldbuilding done.But seriously let me highlight the bosses, there's 9 of them and they're all really cool fights. They're about learning, generally; you'll die pretty quickly the first time, the second time you'll survive longer, and by the third or fourth time you kind of know what you're doing, but it takes several more attempts to actually pull it off. The final boss, especially, is really tense but really fun, with a lot of attacks and a changing arena gimmick to keep things interesting. But all the bosses are very different and well-designed.The gameplay mechanics are pretty sweet, too. The bullet-hopping allows for some inventive platforming before you get the double jump, and combining both types of jumps becomes second-nature eventually. The optional dash boots add a bit of a safety net to things and are pretty darn fun to use, and the teleport mechanic introduced late in the game provides a few extra puzzly mechanics on its own. There are a decent amount of puzzles even without the teleporter, though, but the focus is on the platforming and the enemies. The enemies are generally okay, there's a few I don't like (helper bots can rot in hell) and sometimes they're overly spammy in placing them, but on the whole, alright. Not a fan of when they get in the way of the platforming, though.There's also a ton of stuff to find. 40 health powerups, 40 ammo powerups, 7 grenade powerups, 90 nodes (maybe? nobody's found them all), 18 records, and 3 books, aside from a ton of extra lives scattered around the map. And there's two platforming gauntlets to get the optional dash boots and grenade launcher. The first challenge section is presented to you before you really want to go for it (it's stupidly hard without the double jump, which you can't have when you come upon it) but the section is pretty satisfying when you do have the double jump. Less satisfying is the path for the grenade launcher, which has an overly long and tedious room in the middle that involves, of course, helper bots. The first and last room are both fine, though I don't like challenge based on length rather than pure skill, but ehh, it's mostly the awful middle room. Aside from that room and a few questionable rooms later on in the game though it's generally well-designed and satisfying to play.I just think this game is, all-around, pretty dang good. For the price it's a decent length, it's pretty replayable, it's challenge but rarely unfair, and just an enjoyable experience."

Others praise the fact that it is a Metroidvania, despite the fact it is as linear as Metroid Fusion, which I did enjoy due to the bosses, story, and atmosphere. The bosses in this game, however, are poorly designed due to flaws such as unskippable intro cutscenes, often poorly telegraphed attacks in combination with slight randomization, and sometimes attacks that can be undodgeable in some situations no matter what the player does. The story is not something to be taken seriously, which I can understand, but the back story provided through the Info Codexes can actually mislead the player on enemies by claiming they're invincible to most weaponry when they in fact are not. That particular codex was also placed before a boss, which was immediately followed by a room with moving platforms and at least a dozen of the supposedly invincible enemy flying around in ways that could make them incredibly difficult to dodge, which would often lead to the player being knocked into the instant death spikes which do not respect invincibility frames. This was incredibly pleasant due to the fact that the player can run out of lives at this point, and if they do they have to go all the back to the boss they just killed, and then continue on yet another long path. This life system is incredibly good considering the fact that difficulty is excessive in this game, often matching poorly designed fangames of I Wanna Be The Guy, and if you've played one of those, you'd know they should not be retail games. And yet here we are with a Metroidvania with a life counter, difficulty that is incredibly high for a game with a life counter and very few points you can continue from, and music that I can't listen to for extended periods of time without turning off to listen to something more appealing, such as nails on a chalkboard.In summation, don't listen to the hype of yet another poorly made, ugly ""8-bit"" (which actually aren't 8-bit at all, just a realatively easy art style that's cheap and in vogue currently due to the nostalgia train), and save your money for something more enjoyable, like an actual ♥♥♥♥ing Metroidvania game."

You use your gun for pretty much everything from spraying enemies, to boosting your jump or slowing your descent, to hitting switches, to fighting bosses in which you frequently have to juggle most of the above. It just gets a bit much to manage, switching between using your shots for maneuverability and offense mid-jump while attempting to traverse countless instant-death slime and spike pits in rooms teeming with enemies that will usually end up knocking you off a ledge, and then all respawn when you do.My enjoyment ground to a halt somewhere around I'm guessing halfway through when I lost no fewer than 20 lives to a boss whose main attack I could not reliably dodge thanks to the slight bit of midair inertia that makes precision projectile evading more challenging than it should be, and once I did finally survive that fight by the skin of my teeth I died another 6 times immediately in the following room.

I've played this game for a reasonable amount of time. I know how to play platformers quite well, I've played and grown up with them; playing everything from Mega Man to Mario (the games this one claims to aspire to live up to) and I have to tell you, this game is not good. The game's bosses are either LUDICROUSLY over powered, or just blatantly unfair. Not to mention that they are extremely bland! Take the game's fourth boss, (mini-boss?) for example; he moves from left-to-right, while spamming projectiles that seem to take no path which can be learnt, or avoided, and do more damage than is necessary. When he is on the left side of the screen, you can not go behind him. When on the right side of the screen, however, he is able to be jumped behind so that you can do damage to him without him targeting you. Every blue moon he decides he should address the threat behind him, so he just fires projectiles into the wall in an attempt to hit you, with very little tell that he will do so. Not to mention the fact that your weapons do almost NO damage to any boss-type enemy in the game. You literally have to hit the boss so much that I got BORED fighting him. A platforming game, in which there are boss-fights, caused me to become bored at it's main mechanics. I love mega-man, but this game? Nah. This game isn't worthy of that title. The worst part? The game could have been good! If it was just beta-tested by someone, even if someone played through the first hour of the GAME to address that the charge-shot did almost NOTHING to the bosses in the game, or even the damn REGULAR ENEMIES, for that matter; they would have realized that the games balancing was almost non-existent! The grenades don't actually explode, rather than creating a point at which 7 projectiles come from that do regular damage, the charge-shot is worthless EXCEPT TO SERVE AS YOUR DOUBLE JUMP. Yes, you don't get a double jump. You get a gimped charge-shot that only serves to be a horribly-implemented double jump, there is a bullet-hover mechanic similar to Cave Story's, but doesn't work as well, and you get a secondary weapon system, in which you have limited, but RECOVERING ammo, which you have to get ammo upgrades for that sometimes don't even give you a full ammo for some of said weapons. There is just a myriad of horribly implemented mechanics in the game that preventing it from being what it COULD BE! It could be enjoyable, but with this many issues left un-addressed? No. This game was just a waste of $10, and I'm not one to cry over buying indie games for larger sums of cash."

I agree with user '[BT][BBTS] Ingwaz': ""Rex Rocket tries to be a game like classic mega man. The difference is, classic mega man games were hard, but fair and reasonable."" The save points are spread out enough to cause undue frustration, which is a shame, it would have cost them little to make them more frequent.  When you get a new weapon or ability like the charge shot, you don't feel like ""hey this is exciting, a cool new gadget"".  You think, ""oh great, how are they going to punish me now, for having this.""  There are several Mega Man games from the 90s that were far more enjoyable, even if the graphics were slightly worse.  So why does this game exist?"

For certain reasons I think it's natural to reassure yourself this is a game. The journey is undeniable. The thing is this game meets criteria and keeps the opportunity to grow revolving. This game administers fun.I'm merely posing my own perspective here but I crave danger but prefer perfection.  Am I simultaneously supposed to give up when I traverse a quirk to put my own journey into jeopardy? It's a little unclear as to whether the player gets to reaffirm themselves or if the value just never left. In my opinion short comings are secondary when this game gets the player to it's peaks. Are we supposed to casually watch his ship fall to the forces of evil? Versus the alternative this game treasures the Good vs Evil allegory. Rest assured you can quietly bring swift justice to the forces of evil. 8-Bit Nostalgia? Must have.Create Rex Rocket's killer instinct with your own two hands.

,Not Recommended,288020,34026252,Posted: 4 August,all,curio124,"This game is missing something and I do not know what :-( It looks like nice retro platformer, it 's challenging just right (it IS difficult but not frustratring), it has very good controls (altough need to much keys), it has very nice idea that the whole game takes place in 1 big space ship - still - I was looking forward to finish it after 2 hours or so.It's probably level design - I do not know. There are so many better games like - showel knight, mutant mudds (GREAT one), axiom verge or even super win the game. But if you played all of them, this one is also ""fine""."
76561198060070835,Not Recommended,288020,34148788,Posted: 10 August,all,Mother_Aeris,"Rex Rocket is a 2D platformer with minor exploration sprinkled into its otherwise linear story, which follows the titular hero, Rex[anna] Rocket, a ""badass"" space hero who now helps keep security for a transport spaceship, upon where all hell breaks loose as the on-board AI goes crazy and unleashes slimes - yes, slimes, to take over the ship, and thus, the universe!You may have noticed the quotations around badass, and the reason is simple; Rex is able to perform walljumps to get around the station, but without weapons or upgrades, Rex is super weak! Typical of these old-school inspired games, the hero has knockback when damaged. However, unlike most other games were when you get hit, you have frames of invulnerability to all sources of damage, these I-Frames do NOT protect you against the multitude of instant-death traps literally covering the hallways within the ship. Although slimes are the main enemies in the game, the ship AI also has reprogrammed all the utility robots aboard, yet regardless if the enemies are slimes or robots, their spawns are not in fixed spots within the hallways (save for a very select few, due to being stationary), which can lead to getting hit, receiving the knockback due to damage, and falling into an instant-death trap.This leads into two other major aspects of the game that hurts its enjoyability: The lives system, and your weapon(s). Much like the old platformers of yore, Rex Rocket has a lives system, with you gaining a new life for every 100 energons you collect. Scattered throughout the ship are checkpoints that you return to upon losing a life in the area. When you lose all your lives, it's game-over... or, it would be, if you didn't have infinite continues, which immediately sets you up with 15 lives at the last checkpoint you touched. Because the developer nerfed game-overs from sending you back to the start of the whole area you were in when they occur, this now renders the lives system obsolete, save for frustrating you when an enemy knocks you into a death trap and resets your progress through the room.The last nail in the coffin for the game's enjoyability lies with the weapon(s) you acquire through the game. You get a main blaster that later is able to charge its shot, along with a plethora of other sub weapons that make use of a shared ammo bar, which recharges on its own, along with a grenade system that also has its own recharging ammo bar. While jumping, you can fire downward to propell yourself upward just a little bit more to reach trickier platforms, although it does nothing to properly save you if, say, an enemy hits you mid-jump. Worst off, as you progress through the game, the bosses become MUCH tankier then you, effectively forcing you to sit there and memorize their irregular patterns and bullet hells while they kill you repeatedly, over and over. Worst yet, everytime you die to a boss, you have to sit through their monologues. Every. Single. Time. No skips either for it. While you do get more ""powerful"" weapons later, their slow firing speeds and the equally slow recharge rate for the ammo bar negates their potential usefulness against the bosses, effectively leaving you with just the weak, main blaster you get (and there are no direct damage upgrades from what I've encountered).If you're looking for a difficult, but fair and challenging platformer... look elsewhere, like to Castlevania, Mega Man, or even Metroid. Weak weapons, randomly spawning enemies, instant-death traps galore, and bosses that take more damage then the second coming of christ makes this a receipe for a terribly frustrating platformer that will test your paitence, and the durability of your hardware (a.k.a. your controller and/or monitor)."
