,Recommended,288040,13303118,"Posted: 10 December, 2014",all,Iceo,"Actual Sunlight is an indie title about depression.This game contains strong triggers towards thoughts and feelings such as suicide and depression. Please make sure you are in a strong mental well-being before playing this game. I have listed all the suicide hotlines that I know of, they are available below.You will probably never play a game quite likeActual Sunlight.The story follows a man named Evan Winter, who is struggling with depression. Straight away you sense that he has lost nearly all hope, and is only hanging on because he hopes it will pass.Evan’s problems are taking their toll. He works for a company he doesn’t respect, with many employees he doesn’t respect, he is overweight and wants to try and change that, but work is dragging him down.  He keeps spending money on video-games when he thinks he is wasting his life. Everything in his life seems to have a problem with it, which leaves him with such a depressed mind that no matter how hard he tries to be optimistic, everything seems to be overwhelming to the point where he can’t see past the bad.Evan has been given advice from people on how to live his life. About how he should “lighten up,” or how he should look at the world. Things that many depressed people have been told. But it isn’t helping them, because it is a mental issue, so merely changing your perspective on something won’t help because the thing you need to change isn’t an easy issue to fix. Evan will laugh it off or make self-deprecating jokes, or merely try to deny it. But underneath is that little bit of honesty that they really hope you hear, because they are too scared to say it directly.Actual Sunlightwas made with RPGMaker by one man, Will O’Neill. But behind it’s simple graphics is an incredibly powerful story.This “game” is brutally honest with it’s writing, it’s like being in the head-space of someone or reading their diary, it is SO incredibly personal. But I do think it contains a story that needs to be played by people to truly understand what it is like, at least to the best possible ability. It isn’t a game I would recommend to someone going through depression unless they feel they can 100% handle it. But I do think anyone with a family member, friend or colleague that might have depression, should play this game, so they can truly understand their loved one.This game isn’t one I can score, because it would be like trying to score someone’s life, someone’s thoughts, someone’s journey, it would almost invalidate everything I have said. But if you have a loved one suffering through depression, take the hour and a half to finish this game and try to understand what they must be going through. It’s a rough journey, but you should be by their side to the best of your ability.If you need help, please talk to someone or contact your country’s suicide hotline below._______________SUICIDE HOTLINESAlbania: 127Argentina: (54-11) 4758-2554Australia: 13 11 14Austria: 142Barbados: (246) 4299999Belgium: 106Botswana: 3911270Brazil: +55 51 211 2888Canada - Greater Vancouver: 604-872-3311Canada - Toll free-Howe Sound/Sunshine Coast: 18666613311Canada - TTY: 1-866-872-0113Canada - BC-wide: 1-800-SUICIDE (784-2433)China: 0800-810-1117China (Mobile/IP/extension users): 010-8295-1332Croatia: (01) 4833-888Cyprus: +357 77 77 72 67Denmark: +45 70 201 201Estonia (1): 126Estonia (2): 127Estonia (3): 646 6666Fiji (1): 679 670565Fiji (2): 679 674364Finland: 01019-0071France: (+33) (0)9 51 11 61 30Germany (1): 0800 1110 111Germany (2): 0800 1110 222Germany (youth): 0800 1110 333Ghana: 233 244 846 701Greece: (0) 30 210 34 17 164Hungary: (46) 323 888India: 2549 7777Ireland (1): +44 (0) 8457 90 90 90Ireland (2): +44 (0) 8457 90 91 92Ireland (3): 1850 60 90 90Ireland (4): 1850 60 90 91Israel: 1201Italy: 199 284 284Japan (1): 03 5774 0992Japan (2): 03 3498 0231Kenya: +254 20 3000378/2051323Liberia: 06534308Lithuania: 8-800 2 8888Malaysia (1): (063) 92850039Malaysia (2): (063) 92850279Malaysia (3): (063) 92850049Malta: 179Mauritius: (230) 800 93 93Namibia: (09264) 61-232-221Netherlands: 0900-0767New Zealand (1): (09) 522 2999New Zealand (2): 0800 111 777Norway: +47 815 33 300Papua New Guinea: 675 326 0011Philippines: 02 -896 - 9191Poland (1): +48 527 00 00Poland (2): +48 89 92 88Portugal: (808) 200 204Samoa: 32000Serbia: 32000Singapore: 1800- 221 4444South Africa: 0861 322 322Sweden (1): 020 22 00 60Sweden (2): 020 22 00 70Switzerland: 143Thailand: (02) 713-6793Ukraine: 058United Kingdom (1): 08457 909090United Kingdom (2): +44 1603 611311United Kingdom (3): +44 (0) 8457 90 91 92United Kingdom (4): 1850 60 90 90United Kingdom (5): 1850 60 90 91United States of America: 1-800-273-TALK (8255)Zimbabwe (1): (263) 09 65000Zimbabwe (2): 0800 9102Disclaimer: This review was written gradually over 6 or so months, if others have voiced their opinions that have been voiced similar to mine over that time that is by coincidence."

I'm not in my late 20s/early 30s yet. I don't have a dayjob that I neither love nor care for.  I'm a college kid from China studing economics in the States. Oh and I do cook pretty well, and my obsession with following Ikea's assembly instructions to a T proved to be a bit overwhelming to the few friends I have.Everything else, however, is pretty close. I'm in an alien country, spending money I don't have learning stuff I neither love nor am good at, getting by with passing grades, lying to my parents that everything's fine so they wouldn't completely lose faith in me and their decision of funding my study, and of course, escaping into videogames. I live with four roommates under the same roof who each live their own lives and barely social at all with each other. I've no idea if I would ever find a job, or even complete this degree. I've gained 40 pounds since I came here, and Evan's reflection in the bathroom mirror is not far from my own. Hell, I even have a similar ""relationship"" like Evan and Tori's with my ex, my first date, who I broke up with 4 years ago. And for the past four years, I've been living with my broken promise, which I never told her, that I would make a man out of myself one day and finally face her with confidence. Along with dozens of other promises I could not keep.I've seen my university's counseling service precisely once.I'm pretty sure I just failed a class I have to pass in order to proceed to a dozen of courses to complete my degree.I've been keeping a sharp-tipped fruit knife within my arm's reach for the past three days.I woke up early this morning after 5 hours of medically-enhanced sleep, and I ran into a Kotaku UK's article ""How Video Games Can Help With Depression"", in which Actual Sunlight was mentioned. I found a lets-play on YouTube, and two minutes in, I knew this is a game I need right ♥♥♥♥ing now. Only $5. It's not like I haven't been wasting hundreds of dollars on games already.Playing through the game took me 1.5 hours. It was 1.5 hours of storming emotions, mixed with pre-coffee early-morning drowsiness. I completely understood every single word, and every single meaning behind those words. It tells the story of the life that I've been living for the past four years.And, god, it feels good to know there's people out there. People out there who really understands.And, although the game's ending *minor spoiler* is not exactly happy, I feel strangely motivated. It pins down every single negative emotion that's been bombarding me constantly, like scalpels tracing a circular cut around a bulging tumor, summarizing everything I want to be rid of.But mostly, it's just nice to know that there're people out there who understands.And, coming back to it, it wets my eyes that the author put that one line in the game:""Don't you ♥♥♥♥ing dare.""So I won't. I'm gonna put up one more fight. I've made choices and I had my consequences, but there's still chance. I'm still depressed, but now I actually feel that I'm not alone, and there are those out there who are still putting up there own fights, and there's no excuses for me to give up my own.***I know this is technically not a review, but I'd say it describes the game better than an actual review and accurately reflects what the players are signing up for.BTW, I just realized that I unintentionally threw that knife away along with a bunch of litter in a cake box.***EDIT: This is me from two years later. Fixed a few grammatic mistakes. Man it still hurts like yesterday reading though this. Oh well, sometime it's important to remind oneself that it's worth it to keep on living, even it doesn't seem like it. Keep up the good fight, eh?"

There's a raw reality, sadly, in the unavoidable conclusion of this game. Some might appreciate this, but this is definitely a marmite scenario because I'm not sure if you should play this game when you are depressed or at a very low point. Reaffirming what your most negative thoughts are about yourself, does not seem like a wise thing to do and this game does not offer much hope, just affirmation.The game itself in terms of mechanics is more of an interactive story, whereby you have little sway on the outcome. It's a basic style, done in RPGMaker and the creator has put effort in where he can with little touches and the  dialogue. That said this game is dialogue heavy. The narration screen which projects the thoughts of the lead character is what you'll see more than the environment.This is not a bad game, it's simple, it comes from a powerful and real place, but I think that I would not reccommend it, based on my own conflicts with being stuck in depressive ruts. That's not to say it's awful at all.I wrote a piece about how it's ok to not play depression based games, when you are depressed or going through stages of depression, which might explain my personal thoughts (though I could say much more).http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/GlowBear/it-s-ok-not-to-play-depression-games-279830.phtml/"

This isn't you. You might relate to some/maybe even most of it like I did, but understand that even with all the♥♥♥♥♥♥you have to deal with, this isn't you.I don't wanna say this because someone might take it the wrong way, but here goes;A lot of the things Evan complains about, he IS right about. But that's not what this is about. It's not about what you know, or what happens to you, it's whatyoudo.There's a thing about age, it's a little disclaimer the game throws at you early on, saying that this game is only relevant if you're old. That part is wrong. For one, they think mid-30's is ""old."" Sure, it's a ways down the road, but you've still got a lot of figuring out left to do, no matter where you are. For two, making a drastic change in life is stupid, and you're never old to be stupid."

The two main issues that I tend to have issue with is that they tend to retread the same ground we've seen over before or they're overly angsty. Unfortunately Actual Sunlight retreads the same ground while having some of the most angsty material I've read in a product.We're shown the life of a man filled with extreme self-loathing and hopelessness. He's in a job he hates and his time spent outside of that doesn't fulfil him spending it mostly on drinking and video games. This is a pretty cookie-cutter approach to it and is certainly a setup that is fairly common to the point it feels somewhat snotty, especially when it's such a focus as it is here. However not everything has to be original in concept of course, if it's executed well enough it can still be an extremely interesting piece of media. I have to say Actual Sunlight is a letdown in this aspect too as the game does nothing but beat you over the head with how much the character hates himself when doing anything and while that is obviously an aspect of depression that I can attest to when it's handled in this manner it just comes off as obnoxious and forced, there's no nuance to it and you could get about as much insight into what it's like by simply reading an angsty teens blog and if you're suffering from depression you're unlikely to have any realisation that'll help you cope with it only acting as a reinforcer for that extremely crushing mindset.If you're going into this game you're not going into it for the gameplay obviously. While I'm personally more in the camp that would rather have games properly used to explore the theme via actual gameplay mechanics I can still enjoy a game that's light on that assuming it's executed well. Unfortunately Actual Sunlight uses its interactivity to have you interact with objects in the rooms which just transitions you into text screens informing you how self-loathing the character is, with no clever use of it being a game until closer to the end. The art is very basic too and not pleasing to look at aside from the little original pieces that popup on occasion which I wish was more frequent.Due to the games poor writing and lack of point in it being interactive instead of just a blog I can't recommend this title to anyone.-If you enjoyed my review you may like my wordpress where I write about games in general and review titles that may not be on Steam:https://rainjarblog.wordpress.com/"

So in that sense, as an art game, it's a success.But it's a game that has trouble with the line between being about depression, and just being depressing.  At the end of the day it doesn't have much insight into its own subject matter, not even so far as to acknowledge depression as a semi-treatable illness.  It's a heartfelt anecdote, certainly, but one that offers neither questions nor answers.Nor does it justify itself as a game.  There is little here that could not perhaps be presented more effectively as a series of essays.  Indeed, non-interactive text is the bulk of the content.  The game-like portions, including art assets, are the bare minimum necessary to deliver the text, with little inherent artistic value.So in a world of so many really *great* art games, it's hard to recommend this one."

There's basically no light or hope here, the story goes on and meticulously chronicles the feel of desperation, self-loathing and hopelessness that many people fightning with depression face every day. There can be a few bitter laughs here and there though, if you're a cynic like yours truly, when the game provides some social commentary on how relationships or job seeking work nowadays.Evan Winter, the game's protagonist, is on the far end of the depression spectrum but there's no denying that many people will feel familiar with at least a few of his thoughts, actions and feelings: hereby lies Actual Sunlight's true strength as the game lets you project your own uncertainty and discomfort onto the tale being told.Is this story one for you? It's honestly hard to say...I was deeply touched by Actual Sunlight and personally feel it'd be experienced by basically everyone at least once, provided you won't be upset or disgusted by its themes. I must also warn you though, just as the dev does ingame, that this story could also push you further down a dark path if you're having issues yourself so tread accordingly."

Depression is not an easy subject to discuss nor is it easy to relate to in our case. I've been exposed to the topic and have few people in my life with Clinical Depression, It was tough for me to deal with them and support them but there is no way I can imagine what they are going through. Actual Sunlight has one of these cases and from what I've been through, you know you hit rock bottom when you start contemplating suicide. That is probably the intention behind this game, to bring awareness to the whole topic.I've been torn on whether I would recommend this game or not. There are many reasons for both in my own opinion. For example, I'd recommend it if it would raise awareness to depression and familiarize people with the topic so they can find a way to support someone before it is too late. I'd not recommend it because it is not a very engaging experience, however, that would be quite offensive to the experience on ""Evan Winters"". I decided I'd go with recommending it only because it is not a simple topic and I'd be happy knowing this game could spark a feeling for someone.For the full review, checkhttp://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/11/actual-sunlight.html"

There's almost no traditional gameplay in it. You play it not for ""fun"", but rather for an emotional experience and perhaps for some insight into the psychology of depression.If you're still reading, then maybe you're open-minded enough to get something out of this game. You play as Evan Winter, an overweight white-collar drone who tries to bury his loneliness in video games, daydreams, and misanthropy. Gameplay consists of guiding Evan through a few days in his overly routinized life, interacting with other characters and environmental objects in order to trigger Evan's dark and sardonic commentary (the game isverytext-heavy). As the game progresses through its roughly hour-length, Evan's depression becomes increasingly severe. There is only one possible ending no matter what choices the player makes along the way. And with a name like ""Evan Winter"" ... brace yourself.One of the things I liked the most about ""Actual Sunlight"" was how the developer took advantage of the unique features of video games as a medium in order to convey Evan's psychology in a visceral way. The graphics are mostly flat, basic, and bland; environments are constricted; and the narrative choices given to the player are ultimately illusions -- exactly how Evan feels about his own life. Which is not to say that ""Actual Sunlight"" asks you toagreewith Evan's worldview, but rather to take a walk in his shoes as a cautionary tale. When the game is over, the player must do something that Evan also does every day: put down his/her own controller, return to ""real life,"" and ponder the choices that they may not have even been aware that they were making. The difference is that we have Evan's example to learn from.Sounds like a party, right? ;) Buy ""Actual Sunlight"" if you are looking to think and feel more than to ""play,"" and if you are capable of handling dark subject matter. It took me a couple tries to get into it, but ultimately I'm glad that I did."

It is not a game for the faint of heart, but in its dialogue and dramatic scenes lies a tale of understandable sorrow. The sorrow of never quite knowing one's self or one's worth is a burden that can truly drive one to the brink, and for Evan, the brink is always on his horizon. Dreaming of a better life with a better job, better coworkers, better relationships, and better hobbies eventually cuts into Evan's comprehension of reality and what it means to truly be alive. In this narrative, the player and Evan will discover what life is, its meaning, and what it is to have the power to overcome the obstacles one faces with that knowledge. Sometimes the knowledge, the freedom from the surrounding obstacles, comes at a terrible price; but Evan, trapped in a world of constant fluorescence, truly, honestly, and simply wants the feeling of Actual Sunlight."

The person it portrays is perhaps relevant to many who read this review - but it is in no way supporting of morbid things such as suicide (one doesn't have to relate to appreciate the Actual Sunlight experience, but someone interested in psychology and / or mental illnesses will probably be intrigued by Actual Sunlight.)The out-of-character message was added to explain his concern for who comes across the game and possible negative reactions (or triggers, if you prefer) - and to switch and say out-of-character ""That ain't you. So don't. Don't you ♥♥♥♥ing dare."" (Here you have to remember what the game deals with - i.e. suicide.)I agree with the reviews shown on the shop page that are taken from other sources than Steam reviews. It's a powerful portrait, perhaps because the developer refers to himself in the out-of-character message.I recommend it to people who are not searching for the common perception of ""video game"", but a psychological experience. It would also have to be someone willing to pay its worth (base price 5 EUR / USD) for a short amount of game time. Few people will spend hours on it (including those who do several playthroughs, even though there's not really replayability), and most may just spend minutes on it before they complete the story and catch the point.However, before considering buying, follow the trigger warnings. How do you react to powerful depression- and suicide-themed novels, music, real-life stories or whatever?Actual Sunlight deals with serious topics, and I'm not sure how much courage it took the developer to create this.

Like many have said, it is an accurate representation of the thoughts and mindset of a suicidally depressed person, accurate to the point that I worry about anyone who has these thoughts or feelings playing this game and emulating the protagonist. The game is linear. Plot points are unlocked by making certain decisions and talking to other characters in a specific order. It was almost reminiscent of Takeshi's Challenge in that way, but unlike Takeshi's Challenge, decisions you make in Actual Sunlight have little to no effect on the progression of the game. In fact, the only decision the game lets you make is the order in which you talk to the characters around you to progress the storyline, which leaves you feeling like the ending is inevitable, another thought that someone suffering from clinical depression might have. The game is so spot-on with the symptoms of depression that the developer threw in an in-game note urging young people to not follow in the protagonist's footsteps, which is a nice thought, but I feel it could have been worded much better and overall read as something he felt obligated to do given the subject matter of the game. In short, this game could be a great tool for those who have never felt suicidal to understand what a friend or loved one is going through, but it may not be the best thing for someone going through a dark moment in their life to play."

It is a somber story that certainly does not start in a happy place, but it only sinks lower from there. Depression is not an easy thing to talk about, and Actual Sunlight does not attempt to shy away from every thought that comes from a dark place. The protagonist expects a stranger to try to strike up a conversation with him as he gets on the bus, getting annoyed that some stranger would try to talk to him in a pathetic attempt to make friends, but then the stranger simply tells him something mundane, like his shoes are untied. The protagonist feels stupid for hoping that someone would talk to him, just so he could reject them, but only finds out that he was the one who was pathetic enough to want human contact with a stanger on a bus. He uses videogames and material things to drive away the emptiness he feels inside. He thinks his co-workers are terrible, but he envies them. Nearly everything sends him into a feeling of bitterness and defeat.Finishing Actual Sunlight is not so much rewarding as it is sobering. The gameplay aspect has you interacting with objects and people as you walk around in an oldschool JRPG perspective. There is little to be done besides exploring the environment and talking to other characters, which just peels away more layers of melancholy. It is a different experience, and for better or worse, it is a moving one."

You experience the very downfall of your character, and witness as his entire world collapses around him. Two of the most heavy themes in this game, are suicide and depression.

I chose to give Actual Sunlight a ""thumbs-up"" because it's well made, not because I had a good experience playing it. At any rate, I think it's best to look at what I will say below as a warning or observation rather than a review.First of all, this isn't really a game. It's a narrative experience centered on Evan Winter, a man who thinks he's worthless. The only things to do in Actual Sunlight are examine objects and talk to NPCs. The only choice you have is in which order to do them. Each interaction you perform presents a written vignette that will gradually lead you deeper into Evan Winter's troubled life. Through talking to a limited cast of characters and examining Evan's home and work environments, you will learn about how his life has gone stagnant and gain insight into exactly what Evan thinks of himself, his culture, and his circumstances. These vignettes are sometimes humorous (in a cynical way) or sad, but they always seek to illustrate the profound loneliness of Evan. It took me about an hour and a half from start to finish.The writing is good. That, almost exclusively, is what will carry you through the experience. But when you finish reading the last sentence of Actual Sunlight, you're not going to be smiling. You might not even feel the satisfaction of having read a well-told story... even though the writing does deserve praise. Here's the catch: if you suffer from depression or social anxiety, like I do, reading through Actual Sunlight can be triggering. If you play this game, you are going to stand in the shoes of a man who has no hope and thus no future. If you think (mistakenly) that you are even remotely in the same situation, then please consider firing up some zombie-killing simulator instead. It'll make you feel better than following Evan Winter around.Actual Sunlight is unrelentingly, brutally harsh and dark. There is no redemption to be found here and certainly no happy ending. This game seeks to embrace the old idiom: ""sometimes the light at the end of the tunnel is a train."" It's like witnessing a horrendous car wreck and trying to make sense of it. Can you? Is there any meaning or purpose in something like this? Why did I play this game? I appreciated the quality of most of the writing, but I certainly didn't have fun.

A powerful reflection on depression and the workplace, Actual Sunlight is a pretty harrowing but worthwhile experience, and definitely a steal at this price. It doesn't give you much choice or agency over what you do in the game but that's somewhat the point, and it's an interesting few hours to say the least. To quote a few reviewers -- ‘it is quite possibly a dangerous game […] a game that could drive someone to depression or worse’ (TP Review), ‘this game probably shouldn’t be played if the you have suicidal thoughts, a tendency towards self harm, or are just plain not having a good day’ (Penny Arcade), the game is ‘written in such a way as to make the player consider their own lives, and there are clear attempts to draw parallels between the gamer and the character’ (The Indie Game Magazine).

I was wrong.This game was made in RPGmaker, however is is an amazing game.I cannot stress this enough; If you suffer from depression or are depressed, be very weary of this game, it hits you very hard.You are Evan Winter. A middle aged overweight failed writer. You live in apartment alone. You jack off every night. You hate your job, your co-workers don't really understand you and everyday you think about throwing yourself off of your apartment complex roof just to end it all.This game goes through Evan Winters life and how monotonous and repetative it is.

His only escape is drinking.Every day tasks are made into a complex puzzle and everything is questioned.Slowly you see Evan getting more and more depressed to the point where he is borderline insane.Evan Winter is an in-game representation of the developer as this is very similar to what he went through.

I don't think I'd be wrong to say that much of society today are facing similar feelings and thoughts as Evan.  I have read articles on many kids and young adults that are dealing with depression and suicidal ideation and unfortunately, too many go through with it.  So I know this game will hit too close to home for many who give it a shot.  It's not so much a game, however, as a character study.  What you take from it I would assume is how much you can relate yourself to the protagonist.  If you are the literal equivalency of your facebook profile I can only imagine that you would find this game to be a nonsensical story with a whiny main character.  If that's what you take from it: congratulations.  Your life is perfect.  However, if recent stories on rising depression and suicide rates are any indication then you would be in a miniscule percentage of the human populace.  That is why I think this game is important.  Sure, we're making strides on ""anti-bullying"" campaigns but nobody is really touching these issues.For kids in school with ""no friends"" and teenagers transitions into adulthood who are now getting socked in the head with their first existential crisis, and for all of those soon-to-be thirty somethings who feel like they've wasted their lives, I implore you, the next time something nice happens in your life take it in stride.  Much of life is unhappiness.  But those little things are what keep us going.  Sure, you may die alone and depressed, but what about all of those great games you've played?  What about that totally sweet thing you did the other day that totally mattered to you?When you play this game remember that it is not you.  It's a character study and a damn good one.

The main character was both unbelievably boring and unimaginably irritating and I didn't want to spend more time with him.  And that's what makes this game so good, and why you should play it.It isn't meant to be fun, or happy.  It isn't meant to leave you with a sense of accomplishment.  This is a game that gives you a virtual experience of what depression can be for some people.   This game is hard to play, and I don't mean in a Dark Souls way, I mean in an emotionally draining, exhausting way.I'd suggest, if/when you play this game, to consider how the game makes you feel.  The anger and frustration with the character is completely valid.  The boredom is completely valid.  Now imagine that instead of those feelings being directed at a game, it's directed at your life.  That infuriating character with the dialog that drives you crazy is your own internal dialog.  Yep, you absolutely know better than to do the stupid things he keeps doing. Yup, you can see how things are going to unfold from the moment you start playing,and eventually you're rushing though everything just to finish the damn game with the obvious ending. Yup, everything would be better if he would just stop whining for a moment.  But he won't.  Welcome to what depression is for some people.What makes this game so good isn't the gameplay.  It's how much it makes you dislike it that makes it good.  If you have never experienced severe depression, this might give you an idea so you can understand what a friend/family member is experiencing.  If you have experienced it, consider this a window into someone else's experience, so you can see how things are similar and completely different all at the same time.  But most of all, please don't play this game if you aren't safe right now...take care of yourself.

Personalities and inner world are revealed by the character's interaction with things around him.The game brought me desolation more than anything else, stronger than any other emotions any other games ever brought to me. I have some of the very thoughts of the protagonist: like how other people are more successful, how I consider myself a loser about once every 10 hours on average, how I rarely got around to doing anything i wanted to, how I feel like I am not loved, how I feel worthless, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.I related strongly to the game.But fortunately I am not nearly as hopeless as Evan. I am not 300 pounds, I am still quite young, I have close friends of both sexes even though I never had a girlfriend, I have things that I excel in doing, relatively speaking. I do have a depressing personality, but I can usually get over the downs, and I am far, far from needing a treatment.I guess that is something for me to feel fortunate about, but it also reminds me how Evan in the story is very aware of the fact that there are people suffering much worse, but still can't get around to feeling better. I cannot blame him. When I have my downs, it is hard (ok, impossible) to think straight.This game depicts a depression patient. I do not personally known anybody like this, but I have read about the things written by them on the internet, and I feel for them strongly due to my personality. But, you don't need to be a depression patient to relate to the game. If you are like me, or like anybody who has a insecure personality, you can relate to this. The game encaptures all the thoughts we had at some point.Evan felt like he is worthless, and sometimes so do I.For us insecure, anxious people, recognition is everything. We long to be considered important. We desparately try to get ahead, because if we don't we feel like we don't have value. We have all this wonderful vision for our future selves, and then we commit to doing it, and then we inevitably fail due to our innate qualities as animals. And we berate ourselves for being incapable. We compare ourselves to others, the shiny, successful people around us or on the other side of the screen. We see them with the qualities we desire, with the life we crave, with the happiness we lack.We want to be loved.My favorite movie isBirdman, a story about an actor who fell from fame and could not ever climb back up.Eventually, he jumped off a building. Just like Evan did.To me,Birdmanis a game about self-esteem and personal value. The protagonist struggled for this in the movie and this game.I see all these people in the review section downvoting this game for reasons like it isn't fun, it is too pessimistic, it's just whining like a teenager. On one hand I don't like this. Do people today have so little empathy and sympathy that they just don't care about people as such? But on the other hand, I guess it's a good thing that people can't relate to this, because it shows that they are secure, maybe even happy, at least not depressed in the way that Evan is.Whether or not the developers intended for this to happen, I don't know; but once I got over the residual of the depression brought by the game, I actually felt less burdened and more positive. I came to realize that even though sometimes I think I am messed up, I really am not. I have friends and family who care about me. I have failed but I can start again. I may not be as good as some, but I am better than the vast majority; I only need to be more content with it. I have not lost my passion for life.If you think what I wrote fits you ok, I recommend give this game a try. It is extremely emotional, but it does have something to offer.If you don't want to be depressed because of a game, or you don't find anything above relatable, you probably shouldn't play this.I would like to end this with a poem that appeared inBirdman.Late Fragmentby Raymond CarverAnd did you get whatyou wanted from this life, even so?I did.And what did you want?To call myself beloved, to feel myselfbeloved on the earth."

I really enjoyed Actual Sunlight, the struggles Evan goes through are real every day struggles that people can relate to.- Down below is a bit of a spoiler. I think. -One thing that I'm glad was included in this game was the out-of-control anger scene. I think that people who haven't experienced depression may only think that depression is about feeling sad, hopeless, and having suicidal thoughts. The commercials never say anything about the anger that happens. How it literally takes over your mind and you sometimes can not control the things you say or do when it grabs a hold.

I found myself screenshotting pages of text the way I would highlight them in my e-reader because I loved a turn of phrase. But in some ways the medium for this story took away from the narrative, and it might have been stronger as just text. For example, the artwork was disjointed and the delivery system for the text was more irritating than mood-setting. I felt like I would have carpel tunnel by the time I got through clicking enter at every comma and period in the game. In other ways, controlling the character through their depression added jarring reality that never would have been achievable in any other medium. Suicide is an option available to you at every single point in the game and it really drives the point home about how those urges keep cropping up. I think it's worth a few bucks if you would like to read some really stellar writing and see the potential a video game about depression has.

But there are probably some problems you also (somethimes) have in your life.What I like about this game is that he really says what a realistic person thinks.And it is not like everything gets a little softy.That is why I could connect with his problems and his anger.And with what he says it also let you think.If you are interested to get this game don't expect any gameplay because you are  only walking around, going trough menu's and pressing z.

Evan's bleak, aphoristic thoughts on the world are sprinkled throughout in memos, monologues, imagined talk show appearance transcripts and conversations with his co-workers. They're a joy to read for anyone who likes dark and clever writing.For five bucks, I'm glad I picked this up. It's a very short and human game, and I feel like I know the creator intimately after having gone through it. It's the sort of title that, if a) we were better at describing it all and b) we could convince ourselves to finish anything we start, could come from any member of our strangely disconnected generation who wanted to share their soul.That said: If you're nearing thirty years old, have any doubts about where your life's headed or any sort of history with depression or suicide, I would avoid it. For those types, letting yourself surrender to this game's narrative is like going to be like playing with fire, or coming home to a familiar drug."

There's not much in terms of gameplay, i would compare it to adventure games, visual novels, you walk around and examine and read. I wont beat around the bush, this game is a damn sad tale, and could kill your mood if you aren't prepared for it. On flip side it may help some idetify their bad habits old or new and just look at them and relate.

The power and energy the creators of the game have made is just amazing,What they have written may be awful and horribly depressing to read but its very truthful, a lot of people do feel like the things 'Evan' writes in deep depression and mental illnessess.I'm 17 (I know it says 18+, but I was curious to play this game) and I hate to say I understand how the main character feels in some of his situations and the things Evan said to the ""Doctor"" is pretty close to how I feel about things.It also opened my eyes to how my life could become if I don't try to make something of myself, and I thank the creators for that.

Throgh the lead characters perspective, the story is painfully accurate and holds nothing back to lift the dreadful tone. Its a strong point to consider that this is an utterly depressing and hopeless narrative, but also give the oppurtunity for depressed players to see another perspective of the illness outside of thier own.

His work, like all our work, is meaningless and absurd, and only there to enrich the rich. He, like all of us, is trapped in cycles of debt and consumption. He, like us, is no longer a person, he is a consumer or a comodity or a tool. He is in despair, not because of depression, but because his society has sold him out.For me, the saddest thing is that he didn't have the tools/resources he needed to build the life he needed and escape.

On the other hand, I chose to upvote this because Actual Sunlight does delve into that singular perspective quite well. It's a title which focuses on an aspect of human condition and what we're doing to ourselves in society, often without even realizing it. It tells the story of how a singular character falls into and deals with this particular perspective. I don't really find its negative outlook appealing, but it succeeds in making the player consider what they reading. In some ways I think the heavy handed, over-the-top text is asking the player to come up with their own alternatives to the character's view and way of handling his problems.I also wish this game was longer, so that it could spend more time exploring each character besides the main character.

The game has some funny, almost self-aware moments, which very nearly endeared the game to me. There was one moment, though, that seemed to belittle the very problem they're showcasting here if you're under a certain age, which rubbed me the wrong way and I found it hard to enjoy the rest of the game after that.

In fact, many people are basically useless, and would basically not survive if not for modern society and modern cinveniences. Unlike what someone might say, if you relate to the main character, then the main character is an accurate representation of you yourself. It is people's desires to make excuses and come up with reasons to tell themselves that ""NO: I am not like THAT person"", but in reality, you are EXACTLY that person.People often make the excuse that 30 is still young. I hate to break it to these people, but long before age 30, people in the past, who were more mature, capable and able to move themselves and society forward, were working full time, bringing iupup a family (their children themselves were approaching teenage years), as well as contributing to society in general.Constrast that to the immature, lazy and incapoable middle-aged loners who waste their lives playing video games and posting on facebook. Contrast someone who makes a useless click to Like something, thinking they've actually made a difference, vs someone who actually went out and did something physical.Did people of the past disrespect their workplace and bosses? Absolutely. But they sucked it up and put up with it, unlike the Whaa-Whaa-Nation inhabitants who post endlessly on 'social media' and thing they are high and mighty, who think they could even understand, let alone even conceptualize, what their bosses do, and who have video-game, over-eating induced fantasies about actually moving aobve the station of their ablities and status.Let's face facts: those who waste their lives playing cideo games and posting on facebook, who live alone in their poor little hovel, should concider themselves absolutely lucky to have a job, ANY job, a place to live and video games to waste their lives on.These useless people dream of love and a family, when in reality, no sane or intelligent woman would ever be caught with them, and children could ever be raised by, or even respect them. The game states that at age 25, you're not old enough to have these opinions, but like I mentioned above, in the past, people age 25 had long since stopped being children and were full adults. And this includes the parents of these people.Neither the protagonist's parents, nor the rest of society, are at fault here, none of which caused this person to be the way he is. The complete responsibility resides with the proteagonist himself, plain and simple.Oh, and just like now, people in the past had their share of mental and physical issues, including depression and loneliness. Unlike this loser, however, they took responsibility for themselves and their lives, and those who realized they were no good for either a woman or a family simply accepted this fact and moved on, acting appropriately.I think what makes so many people uncomfortable about this game is this game exposes people for who and what they truly are, no excuses, no crybaby, touchy-feely confidence building.And society as a whole is absolutely better for it."

Although, for me personaly our outlooks and how the issue effects us are very different. His struggles are of that in conflict with his life and choices where mine are dealing with the very poor health side of things.If you are interested in a loose defined late onset depression as apposed to what would probably be classified as early onset depression this game is very interesting. A lot of people seem to be afraid that someone with depression or going through something will do something drastic but in reality it would probably give them something to relate to / might help them process. If not than they are probably already in a level of trouble that the contents of this game wont be the swaying factor. Individuals with depression are usually some of the absolute strongest people I know who are usually geared towards survival. They do not need to be protected they need to be supported.The game treats the subject matter in an adult way and doesn't shy away from subject matter too much.Depression, both early and late onset is a very serious subject and needs more light and treatment options available.So I am glad this exists.  As a game it isn't really anything special,  but as an art peice it stands well enough.If the subject interests you or you like the psychology it is worth the hour or so to play through it.----------------Make up your own mind.DanielJMWaters."
