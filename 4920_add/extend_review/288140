76561197993543596,Not Recommended,288140,22820800,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,Grayperview,"Now that the game is fully released i can give a full reviewGraphics - 6/10 by modern standards the graphics are quite poor, they chose to use directX 9 along with unity, The Graphics look ok at first but when you look closer you realise how basic they are.  Water looks terrible, no 3d grass for light rough and rough, lighting is very basic and the performance is inconsistant from course to course. I have to turn settings down on an I7 4790k@4.6ghz and a amd Fury to maintain 60fps on some courses.Gameplay - 7/10 RTS is broken, it is way too sensitive, move the mouse back 2 pixels and thats a full back swing at 800dpi* on a 1080p screen, only increasing the screen to 1440p and the mouse DPI down to 400 is the RTS some what controlable,this is using the lowest sensitivity setting in game....Even then there is no feel and putting is a joke, with the ball rocketing off the face after the smallest slowest movement you can possibly do with a mouse, to top this the game gives zero feedback whilst on the course has to what you are doing right or wrong, the only way to get feedback is to go to the practice area (no putting green btw), and you will get feedback through a launch monitor,  not that it will be any use to you as there is zero explination of what the numbers mean, so if you have never been on launch monitor in real life and had the number explained to you, you are screwed basically. This wasn't thought through at all and they listened to totally the wrong people when implementing this.*Mice used Roccat Kone XTD and Corsair Vengence M65However mouse swing using the meter isn't bad at all,  although it will be very difficult for the beginner. so max assists is recommended..Presention - 6/10 simple menus very easy to navigate....nothing to write home aboutValue - 5/10 Thought long and hard about this, if the game was £14.99 i would say yes the game is good value for what you get, but they have released it at £26.99...and on top of that have release an extra course as day one DLC (if you have DLC ready for day one, it should be in the game at no extra cost) and are planning more micro transactions.  So id say this game isn't good value, as of now there is no career or progression system, there is a planned course designer, but has yet to materialise (no idea what its going to be like)...there is online play, and solo rounds, for a golf enthusiast maybe just enough, but for a gamer looking for something to play, £26.99 is going to be poor value.Overall 5/10 This game offers nothing for the causual/gamer player, the learning curve is very steep, with zero understandable feedback from the game ( A launch monitor is jibberish to the none enthusiast Golfer, even to some Serious golfers), The gameplay is kind of there, you just have to put is stupid amounts of hours to find it, and you will have to go on the forums to find out what the numbers on launch monitor mean....I do like parts of this game, but i can not recommend it (not at £26.99), so its a thumbs down from me.Edit... I was banned from the forums for critizing thier micro transactions implementation in this game, the game is on its way to pay to win, with being able to buy balls and clubs that change the way the game plays.....Avoid this game and do not support this GREEDY developer.Edit... I just found out that this developer is going to make you pay for ""major"" updates to the game, disguising them as DLC....So this means if you want to keep your game upto date you are going to have to keep sheling out your hard earned cash to do so, and this is after they have the nerve to charge £26.99 for a half finished game.....Edit... This is a quote from the Dev reguarding the future of the game""Once additional Feature driven DLC is available access to play user created content will be limited to those players who are on the new version."" This means courses you create yourself you will not be able to play anymore once the DLC update is released unless you buy it....This is disgusting from the dev its not enough that you have already paid for the game, they just want to fleece you out of more money.....Devs if you read this, its not the peoples who bought this games fault you underestemated how much this game would cost to develop and its not right to ask them to pay extra for updates, no matter how substantial the update is, The way good developers work is once you buy a licence for a game or piece of software it entitles you to updates for life, unless specifically stated...This was not the case with this game, you waited until we had paid our money, and then unleased the news that we would have to pay money for ""milestone"" updates....Sorry but this is morally repugnant on your part, and you have shown that you are just going to milk this community for a long time to come...i really hope more people see through you.Shame really because your game isn't bad, and if you had used directx11 from the start (oh one of things they want to charge for is porting the game to DX12)  and polished the game a little more before releasing it, the game would have sold well and you wouldn't have had to resort to such shaddy practices."
,Not Recommended,288140,16513685,"Posted: 18 June, 2015",all,tlvx,"The entire Bug Reporting section of the Perfect Parallel forums, is not even available to the public. A user must register in order to view the Bug Reporting section of the Perfect Parallel forums. Here, try to find it, otherwise:http://www.perfectparallel.com/forum/26-perfect-golf-bug-reporting/Instead of taking bug reports seriously, the developers have religiously deleted legitimate forum posts, and fabricated TOS violations out of whole cloth... in an obvious attempt to muzzle legitimate criticisms.When a developer starts deleting on-topic forum posts, devoid of any rules violations, whatsoever... than, they have reached a new low.The developer has now fully retaliated against these criticisms... by issuing a permanent forum ban; as of December, 19, 2015.Only, that's not the good part. The good part; is that, the developer actually dredged up a forum post from May, 2015... as a pretext for a permanent forum ban, that has now been issued over 6 months later!So, basically... Necroban. Here's the screenshot to prove the surreptitious hilarity. If you'll notice, there isn't even anything listed under the all important, ""Ban Reason.""http://s19.postimg.org/3tdzlgav7/2015_12_19_pg_forum_ban.pngThe fact that, a game developer, would actually peruse back over 6 months into a user's post history, as a pretext, to ban them from the forums - and still not be able to come up with a legitimate reason - is both sad, and pathetic... on so many levels. (The ban has since been revoked)Forget about the game. One would reasonably expect more professional behavior from the developers.Nevertheless, here are the rest of the issues with this game:While there are multiple control methods; the controls – particularly when attempting to navigate through the menus and the settings - are both clunky and frustrating.There exists no tutorial, despite the entire piece of software being anything but user-friendly.While there does exist an official Practice Facility, the player is not able to move around, nor follow any shot within said facility; nor can the player putt in the practice facility.The sound is somewhat intermittent, with the impact of golf shots oftentimes being completely missed.The graphics are not entirely terrible, if one is able to use their own imagination... with several obvious gaffes, relating to blending, or the lack thereof; as well as, poor water reflections, and nonexistent edge refraction.For example, the outline of the rough - that separates different types of rough - often bulges, and causes shots hit there to bump squarely up against the outline of the rough, as if the golf ball were coming in contact with a street curb, as opposed to - thick grass.Another example; is that the cart paths hover above the ground. The developer has stated this is intended, as it is apparently a workaround to another issue. – Okay.Another huge issue is the lack of smooth undulating surfaces, particularly on greens. There are jagged creases and geometric shapes with straight lines protruding from the ground; oftentimes causing the golf ball to veer off of its intended path, unnaturally.The latest golfer avatar looks horrendous. The setup positions are largely incorrect, down to the backwards hand positioning. Also, the swing animation has a terrible hitch in it. – It's all just very amateurish in appearance.There is no user customization, whatsoever. Each and every user is required to use the exact same character. The only variation being, some pewter-like shirt color adjustments.The developers have repeatedly made unproven claims about the accuracy of their physics engine, as it relates to actual Tour Golf... despite the actual in-game physics being routinely over-corrected, with each subsequent new draft version of this game.Hitting three-quarter shots makes the ball roll forward excessively, moreso than would be realistically attainable with any given club.In this game; shorter, more-lofted clubs, will oftentimes actually incur more roll-out, than longer, less-lofted clubs... when struck in the same exact manner. Go figure that one out.Or, shots struck with more power, right on the sweet spot, will oftentimes inexplicably lose distance... regardless of the trajectory of the shot.Occasionally, the golf ball will actually penetrate underneath the surface of the turf, warp underground, and pop back up above the surface. This is completely inexplicable, and destroys all immersion.There have been ongoing issues with ball markers; not showing up, nor being in their correct location.There have been ongoing issues with Gimmes; freezing the game progression entirely... when hitting a par 3 tee shot that lands inside Gimme range.The Concede Hole button oftentimes causes the wrong player or team to win the hole.There have been ongoing issues with multiplayer connectivity failing.There have been ongoing connection issues, which may cause undue stuttering while spectating shots.There are ongoing issues with lag, and unexplained disconnections.The Course Creator has yet to be released. However, some beta testers have managed to create courses. The issue is that the system is entirely disorganized, causing users to have to download each course from varying download services, and manually extract each file individually into the correct game directory.There are also no Auto-Updates in place, which also can cause users to have different versions of courses. Yet, there are also false positives, that prevent users from joining games, when the two users in question actually do have the same course version.The lobby itself, is setup rather haphazardly, with inaccurate and incomplete references to player locations.The game is constantly being pirated, and the developers cannot seem to figure out how to kick multiples of obviously hijacked Steam accounts, from the lobby.Chat boxes oftentimes fail, rendering in-game communication inoperable. Also, Multiplayer games are not automatically setup for Voice Chat. Players have to either setup Steam Voice Chat, on their own; or use utilize an outside Voice Chat service.There is no Shot-Clock to dictate a fair pace of play, which is part of the official rules of golf. Since there is no Simultaneous play option in this software... the lack of a Shot-Clock becomes a big deal, as multiplayer stroke games tend to run quite long; or at least, much longer than they conceivably should.It is not possible to convert a grouping to Custom difficulty settings. The difficulty settings chosen must fall under a default difficulty level. The alternative is to allow “Any” difficulty level to join the game; which creates obvious mismatches.The putter head is not at any time squared up at address. Not only that, but the putting itself seems to impart far more break than would realistically occur on similar greens, in real life.One of the most egregious issues, is the lack of Competitive Purpose, anywhere in the game. There is no Career Mode. There is no Official Tour. There are no Rated Multiplayer Games. There are no Win/Loss Records. There are no Experience Points. There aren't even any In-Game Statistics, nor any track-able Player Averages.While anyone can play or join Multiplayer games with and against other users; there is presently nothing whatsoever to play for.“Perfect Golf,” is like a less polished version of the Tiger Woods Golf series. A Poor Man's Tiger Woods Golf, if you will.It originally showed some promise. But, as of yet, there are too many game-breaking bugs, ongoing... as well as, occasional physics anomalies, and the glaring lack of any Competitive Purpose, whatsoever; which would compel any fair-minded individual to - in its current state - give it a thumbs down."

I mean, this is golf ... a game who's purpose and intent is to fill one's time with it's own inherent frustrations as a way of rejuvenating one's soul from the frustrations of day-to-day life. If I am frustrated in this game, it should be because the greens are fast and it's especially windy that day, not because my swing suddenly develops some kind of Charles Barkleyesque series of pauses and stutters for some unpredictable reason.

Also, I've been playing the best golf-sim till now, the RTS swing in Links 2003. I thought it would be impossible to better that. Other games, like Tiger Woods, WGT or The Golf Club have lot's of glitch 'n glossy of course, but they don't have that 1 definitive thing: a true golf swing. It's just not there. And that is what a lot of people have been waiting for: the true dynamics that go with immerging yourself in a virtual golfing environment. Swing plane, swing tempo, clubface angles, it's all there. And more. Much more.But it's here now! For the very first time, we now have 'The Motion Swing' in Perfect Golf. A true masterpiece of computer engineering. After spending a couple of hours on the driving range in PG, I've started mastering this great simulation. Everything is there, albeit in embryonic phase, not polished and glitchy yet, but it's there! AND it works beautifully. For every golfer out there, real or otherwise, Perfect Golf is going to be your game, I garantee it.Once you get past The Motion Swing (3-click is also on board for the diehards) you'll discover courses and other options to keep you happy for ever. Not right now of course, the game is being build as I write this, but in the coming months PG is going to become the new standard in simulation golf. One reason for this, is because it has a man on board who has been at the forefront of golfcourse design: Mr Mike Jones. A one time golfpro himself, he started dabbling in PC golf years ago, and ultimately became a major force is this departement. It helps if you KNOW what the game is all about.A sublime golf swing, real weather simulation, all kinds of gameplay, on- and offline, courses come to life with moving objects like trees, water etc, Perfect Golf is going to be everything golfing adepts have been waiting for. All we now have to do is wait for it's completion."

I think that speaks for it's self. What sports game comes with no career?Game mechinics; while it seems to work ok in mouse mode, the controler is at best week. example, push left anolog stick once you get a stick one the course you can use for directions, push it again and you are able to see on the little map the distance and direction to the pin, sounds great till you have to move the curser from 3 holes over just to get it back to the hole your on.

The PC used to be the home of golf games, these days the available library of golf games on PC are a joke.The problem with this game is the same as the problem with ""the other"" one (The Golf Club), the swing mechanics are inconsistent. Golf is a game of consistency and finesse, especially on the green. The control system in this game doesn't allow for either of those things. Having said that, I'm referring to the motion swing mechanics as I'm not a fan of the 3 click method.If you really want a good golf game on PC and you're not too fussed about graphics, Links 2003 is still available and is pretty much the only worthwhile golf game on the platform right now.

The reason successful sports games become successful is they often find engaging ways to make the player feel they are doing better, or making an impossible shot possible.I'm sure someone will get on me that ""THIS GAME ISN'T FINISHED"" and to give it a chance later (which I will) this is more of a shining example of reasons we as a community should stop this wave of pre-alpha games from mudding up and getting mixed in with finished games.

If you are coming from Tiger Woods series or Golf Club you will have a steep learning curve.  You can get the hang of it but why try so hard when there other options to play.. to be honest I rage quit (while trying the motion swing) this game and went back to Tiger Woods 08.. The only reasonable control scheme at the moment is the 3 click in this game.. The graphics are ok.. I assume they will get better, overall I'd rate this game a 5 out of 10 until further development fixes problems and the odd nuances."

Also, a multiplayer lobby and a multitude of game modes are great to see, but sadly no career mode or ""pro mode"" or anything like that.But there also are endless strange bugs and interface weirdness, especially using a controller (which is the newest way to play, so hopefully that gets worked on more).The main hangup is the old looking graphics.  The game has no grass, really basic looking water, trees with an odd sort of sheen look to them (something weird about how they look especially in the distance) and overall just appears to my gaming eyes like something you might have thought ""looked great"" in the early to mid 2000's.  Now I'm used to such a higher bar of quality in most every other game, genre and platform, that it is really hard to look at and enjoy for me.  It's all just flat textures draped all over for the most part.  Thumbs down on that for sure.I guess if you can get past the really old looking graphics, it's a great game of golf. But for me I can not do a ""recommend"" on it with graphics this behind the times.  Being on a golf course involves natural beauty and graphics quality is a main part of this type of games' appeal to me....and perfect golf lacks in this area big time."

I decided to take the time to play Royal Birkdale (fan created) on JNPG, Tiger Woods 2008 and Links 2003 (while watching the Open) and found that while PG is sometimes prettier to look at in a screenshot, the gameplay of JNPG compared to TW08 and Links is abysmal.If I could only choose one of the three, I'd choose TW08. And since there are new real courses still being released regularly and frequent online tournaments, it isn't even a close comparison. Add in the Career Mode and MUCH BETTER physics/swing and I think it is finally time for me to uninstall JNPG for the last time.Some specific issues from my round today in JNPG; a putt from the fringe while the flag was in the cup resulted in my ball running over the cup and through the flag as if neither existed. The shadow rendering is horrible, and the flag shadow in particular is headache inducing. The follow camera is clunky, the aiming on the putting surface results in annoying redraws that truly destroy any immersion. And before anyone suggests ""But you can adjust things"", I spent considerable time adjusting and never got to a setting that made me want to keep playing.End of Edit.Don't waste your time or money.Each ""patch"" breaks more and more, (edited to say...) and more and more and more.Poor physics, broken swing meter, yardage that is way off, flashing textures on objects, and hilarious devs that forgot that this is supposed to be a game.A fractured multiplayer community since the OGT site competes with the Lobby for players.Go play TW2008 or Links 2003... more fun, no headache.Oh, and ""Course Forge"" public beta has finally been released.

SHUT DOWN MY ENTIRE PROFILE SO IT WAS NON RETRIEVABLE no doubt to get rid of the evidence of sabotage!!! UNBELIEVABLE AND DRACONIAN TREATMENT OF A PAID UP CUSTOMER!!! just to check it was a result of my complaint I created a new temporary profile and resent the request for a 3rd party investigation - account completely shut down again.conclusion:- SO WE KNOW THEY (Perfect Parallel and it's employees, particularly Mike Jones) ARE SCUM, THEY OPERATE LIKE SCUM AND THEY SHOULD BE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY A CONSUMER WATCHDOG!!!!!!! ***But these observations have to be stated and addressed for the good of the game and it's standing in the future because proper course critics who do get commisioned to evaluate courses would laugh our St Andrews out of town - hands down they would it would get savaged in any magazine review for instance!! But that says a lot about Mike himself, the qualities of the man - he's peevish, if I wanted to say it more succinctly - he's a very awkward man with terrible judgement and limited scope - you get them usually as security officers and they have that regrettable nature about them, that's why they stand the gates 11 hours a night I suppose, but not nearly qualified for a position Mike Jones finds himself in.The management of this game is also woefully inadequate and the forum best exemplifies that - they have let 3 or 4 of the most unfortunate people run riot here and spoil it for the rest, and as The Golf Club starts up societies and captures the mass market this one has been left behind in the sticks through poor project planning and will end up nothing more than a backwater of a few gnarly old men who know their life is spent and have nothing better to do than henpeck all day.They are still stuck in a cycle of patching up and re patching up bugs and performance issues when they should really be doing time-cost-perceived benefit analysis, there are many soft-fixes that I can see that would result in a considerable perceived improvement to the game, but as it stands there does not appear to be any kind of project planning utilizing the most effective tools in this regard.In fact I percieve the game after a while away from it as actually being 'MORE BROKE' than it was over a year ago with the constantly disappearing swingmeter in 3 click mode standing out like a sore thumb, I mentioned it several times but got zero response from the team as they only seem to take the word of a few select. One of their very very top level designers I have chatted with has called it 'the clique' and described them as 'in their own world', and it has done absolutely nothing for the furtherment of the game over that time period I mentioned.Badly badly run indeed, I play it, play it a lot but I can't recommend it.

So the flood of recent reviews stem from that request.Even with the latest updates this game still has a long way too go. The RTS mouse swing isn't as good as PGA2k, TW series or CPG/WGC. It just has no feel, you have no idea what went wrong when the swing motion that just worked fine now sends your shot shanked off into the woods or a hazard. Ball physics are still unrealistic. This game is more frustrating to play than real golf a lot of the time.I would love to say yeah buy it. But if you do just know there is still a ways to go yet.Recommend this game? yes with a caveat. It is FAR from ""Perfect"" Golf. ball physics are terrible, putting is unrealistic, motion swing isn't real-time or tied to the golfer, wind has no effect, multiplayer has issues. Graphics are good (not as good as The Golf Club, better than World Golf Challenge 2011, the other 2 golf games I play).The other caveat is to play this (and most new games) you'll need CPU and video card horsepower to run  it at high graphic settings.Basically this is Links 2003 updated to a 2009-ish game. If you like Links 2003 you'll really like PG. For those of us who like a golf game with a real-time mouse swing buy this early access release and see if the improvements over time make it better. $20 isn't a deal breaker. Right now I've stopped playing it and will try it again in a month or so to see if any improvements have been made.UPDATE 8-13-16many patches later this game still has issues. Latest patch introduces some ""anti-cheat"" into the software. So if you make a number of good swings the game says ""must be cheating, using some outside swing aid on the mouse"" and then will cause a mis-hit resulting in an errant shot. So you get penalized for honing a swing?!?Ball physics still not realistic. Lob Wedge  shot lands, kicks forward?? no back spin? Yet out of the rough or sand ball checks up and spins back.They really need to bring back the original programmers who initially did the game so the code that keeps getting broken with every patch can be fixed. but given so many have now worked on the code, it's probably really messed up for good and needs a complete rewrite.So still can't recommend this game, just be aware of all the faults if you do decide to buy"

I'm running the game in windowed mode 1280x768 on a 5 year old laptop with AA on and Bloom on. Trees are set at 350, shadows 200, Grass 100 and camera view distance 1500. All things considered the game runs good apart from a few stutters here and there that I can live with and haven't yet affected the playability.Ball Physics: the team has done a wonderful job on the ball physics, especially after the latest update. I considered the ball physics in Links v1.07 to be one of the best I've seen in a golf game but in PG they've taken it to another level of realism. Sure, there is still some work to be done but having played a few different golf games this is the best I've experienced as yet .......BUT .... while I feel that tee to green the devs have created up to now the best simulation of real golf yet seen in a computer game, I do feel an element of realism is then lost with the putting model. To help explain this I should point out I am a novice real life golfer, having only played the game for around 18 months. So it is fresh in my mind what it is like to be a beginner and having to learn the game. I feel a simulation should have the same sort of difficulties and learning curve with all aids off as the real thing. That may also mean I'll never be able to shoot under par for a round as in real life. A par on a hole should feel like an achievement. Unfortunately the putting model destroys this sense of achievement because it feels like I have too much help. Sometimes I misjudge my long putts on a real course massively - and that never seems to happen to me in PG due to the putting meter. And sometimes in real life I've putted from the fairway just off the green and given too much power and ended up off the other side of the green. I can't seem to do that in PG as my power is limited by the meter.My suggestion - a straight swing bar that follows the movement of the mouse. The putter head placed two thirds down the bar with movement then for back swing and power and length of follow through for movement. Putting aids can be markings on the bar to help judge distance but true simulation mode with no aids would be with no markings and just from feel as in real golf. Don't know if something like this is possible. It would mean that by selecting a putter the graphic would automatically switch from an arcing swing meter to a straight putting bar. In simulation mode full back swing (of course restricted to a point) and full, fast follow through would always result in a maximum power putt.A free roam mode would be nice, even if it was only restricted to a 20 or 30 yard zone around the golfers position, to allow for better planning of shots like in real golf when views are restricted. Of course, these restricted views should also be set to golfers eye level for realism.Look forward to future update improvements and hopefully more courses. Great job so far and the closest to a simulation of the game I've yet to play."

It is against my ethics to do so.But anyone that is interested to see what other games I play, my profile is not private, so you are more than welcome to do so.Again, I wish that I had waited for good period of time before I purchased the game.

There is no AI, no season/career options, no stats, no tournament play. You can play a round against yourself or an online opponent and that's it! Graphics are average but it does however still require serious PC juice to run. Menus are few because there are no real features that require menus. Visually the menus have a very simplistic layout and are certainly not intuitive to navigate. There are no great new features in Perfect Golf that other golf games don't have. The features it does have are nothing new and are extremely basic with many bugs/issues.You would think the developers would do something great with one of the most important areas of any golf game, the swing meter! Well, no, it's as basic as you can get!I like to click. You have some very basic difficulty settings you can adjust for the game difficulty and that's the end of the swing meter feature list. There is no option to change the swing meter speed to something of your liking. There is no option to add markers to the meter. The meter links to the graphics engine so if you don't have a silky smooth running game, you also won't have a silky smooth meter making it impossible to play. These are simple meter options golf games over a decade old provided. Perfect Golf gives you the most simplistic of meters with virtually no options to tailor it.If you use the mouse method for swing, same deal, extremely basic with little to no control. There is not even a horizontal mouse swing option! There is no feedback on how well you did with your swing as in Tiger Woods games so you never know what area of your swing needs work.Considering how little of a golf sim Perfect Golf provides, you would think the developers would nail what has been done before in golf games and improve upon those features. No such luck! Here we have first time developers and it shows in every bland detail of the game!One final example to leave you with. The game contains a follow the ball in flight option same as a ball-cam from the Tiger Woods games. In Tiger Woods the camera follows the ball through flight and as it hits the ground the camera smoothly follows behind the ball as it bounces and comes to a stop. In Perfect Golf, as the ball hits the ground, the camera bounces along with the ball! The entire screen jumps up and down. Talk about annoying! Talk about motion sickness! Talk about the feeling you are playing arcade golf! You find youself expecting the golf ball to explode or some dude to come out from behind a tree and start shooting at you every time your shot hits the deck!It's an early access game but it's not too difficult to see a game that no amount of time and patching will help ever become a good one.

Specifically, the course designer for PG has been long discussed and was supposed to be in the game on release. 4 months later it's still not there. Beyond the course designer, there still is no career mode. The game still has performance issues. There still is limited character customization, no announcers, very limited stats, poor UI, etc. Essentially almost NONE of the negatives have been fixed even though many of those things have been promised. Thus I can't recommend the game because I don't see tangible progress in improving the product.-----I've been arounds since PG's failed kickstarter. I bought the game as soon as it came out on Early Access. However, that doesn't make me a fan. It makes me a fan of golf games. PG does some things right. It does some things wrong. Because it's a mixed bag, it's easier to list what is good and what's bad about it. As always, YMMV.Pros:- numerous swing type options - there are multiple though I'm a three clicker all the way and very impressed by the smoothness of the meter. The mouse swing is challenging. They've tried to implement no-cheating modes but they broke the mouse swing while doing so.- various levels of challenge - play this with all the aids on and you'll be in birdie city. Play this without them and you might be lucky to break 90. I'm not nearly as good as I once was, but at one point I was in the top 10 on Case's Ladder on Links and #1 on another ladder. So I'm glad it's challenging rather than the ""Shoot 48 at Augusta on Tiger Woods"" mode.- good physics - I'm still not happy with the backspin but generally the physics are good and better than any other golf game. Backspin still is off and I generate more backspin on my short irons (and I shoot in the 90s) than my avatar in this game. Other than that they're spot on. For instance, if you play a course at higher elevation the ball will travel further. That's a nice touch.- weather / time of day settings can add some real challenge to your game. I think the wind feels spot-on.- many different courses to choose from and quite a few to download- multiple modes of gameplay, including solo, multiplayer and tournaments with match play, team play, alt shot, etc.- no micro-transactions that improve your game- no stupid characters that drive the ball 400 yards. Over-driving distance ruins so many golf games and they've prevented that here.Cons:- no career mode built into the game yet- course designer hasn't been released yet (it's now 4 months late and counting)- I don't like the way the skies look and the trees can look a little jagged- limited current player animations (no lefties, no females yet though they're coming)- very,very, very limited character customization- it requires a decent computer and user made courses don't always run well. In fact, the user made courses often exceed the RAM allowance in the game causing major problems from a chunky swing meter to crashing.- slightly too limited shot shaping options. I wish I could position my swing path and feet differently to get inventive when shotmaking.- very limited stats- no announcer and limited sound effects- no Steam Workshop integration (a cardinal sin for a game with downloadable courses)- really poor and frankly butt-ugly user interface when you enter the game (though it's fine when actually playing a round)So it's up to you whether to buy it. I can tell you it's a better game than that ""other"" golf game on Steam and probably the best one available on the market today. But it's by no means perfect yet (pun intended) and while I had hoped that many of the cons would be fixed, this doesn't seem to be happening. The product feels more and more abandoned with a lack of substantial progress since release.If you want a golf game now, this is the one to buy becuase frankly it's probably your only decent choice. Since I'm a fan of the old Links games and golf games in general so I continue to load up PG from time to time. But if you aren't a golf nut, this game isn't for you because it's just too limited in the features and progress to appeal to a wider audience."

However, that's where the good ends.I could not get to grasps with the motion swing at all. Too many variables to get right to hit a 'perfect' swing and the smallest of errors with timing or mouse movement cause a hook shot of note. I even tried the 'ruler' trick to try to get the movement staright at least but timing issues again produced nothing but hooks.So 3 click swing it is. In 'begginer' and 'amateur' 3-click is manageable. You do really need to be close to the mark on the downswing of the meter but I found it quite playable. Pop the game up to 'pro' and this changes completely. A pixel either side of the marker on the downswing and its off into the bush, rough or water. I played through 9 holes and hit the fairway once. Totally frustrating gameplay.Ok, so I'll stick to 'amateur' then. After having completed quite a few solo rounds I decided to have a look at the other game types. Tournaments looked promising at first. I liked the idea I can play at my own pace and compare my score to others. However, for the 20+ hours over a few days I have played this, only one tournament has been available on a course that is not included with the game that I would need to purchase. Nope.Right then, multiplayer. Lobby is almost empty each time. Max 30-40 players while I am checking (UK GMT day time). Most on courses I dont have or need to pay for. There simply aren't the numbers playing to make it viable for a range of play types and players.It's a shame, I played TW from TW 99 on Windows 98 through to PGA Tour 2008 and the multiplayer stroke play was great fun. I was hoping I had found it again but alas, no. The golf club with no click swing and inconsistent swings is no better either.So that's that. I had really high hopes on my initial play through but as I delved deeper into the game it became overly difficult making it unplayable at the level I wanted and I don't want to have to pay for every additional course.Not recommended, sorry."

On some holes you might think you were playing mini-golf because the cup actually sits atop a mound. The AI makes improbable shots from the tee, from the fairways, and on the greens. To be fair the AI shots are sometimes what you would expect at a setting of ""1""--but then there's those ""wow"" shots. Very inconsistent.Also, there is no way to ""save"" your preferred settings from one session to the next.

Things that seperates itself from other games:-A real time physics engine combined with real ball flight data(launch angles, spin rates and ball speeds) taken from launch monitors put this game in a class of it's own. Once you experience the before mentioned there really is no going back to other golf games.-The Motion Swing mouse mechanic is a first of it's kind that introduces D plane swing theory. What is D plane theory and how does it realate to the mouse? Well, the simplified answer is the tracking of the actual swing path plus the tracking of the clubface angle. Your swing path is determined by the direction you move the mouse and the clubface angle is determined by the tempo at which you move your mouse.-A real time weather and lighting system allow you to input a geographic location and play in those weather and lighting conditions. Never before has a golf game recreated weather and lighting conditions like this game. The lighting and shadow effects are exceptional and really change the look and feel of a course. You can even play in a thunder and lightning storm. Even though you wouldn't do this in real life it's worth doing in PG just to see the lightning effects.-The last thing worth mentioning, and maybe the most important is, this may be the first game to offer up realistic scores in competition. I see no way to shoot in the 50's on a consistent basis, especially with aids turned off. I see scores being very close to real life, maybe even higher. Since tempo plays such a high role in the swing, straight edging or trying to zero out the x axis on the mouse is not going to get your far. Also, since the game uses a real time physics engine to determine spin you can't put artificial spin on the ball and throw darts at every flag.$20 for this game is a steal. Buying it now will save you $10 to $15 when it goes retail. Once the course forge is released with the retail version and courses start pouring in, there will be no reason to even talk about another golf game. The potential this game has is limitless.

The graphic improvements will no doubt continue in the future with the possible addition of 3D blades of grass using Nvidia’s Turf Effects tool.The newly implemented Real Time Swing for controller and mouse has enhanced the game immeasurably in addition to the availability to download fine user made courses (around 24 available as of the date of this review).  That brings the current number of stock and user made courses up to around 37, a number no other modern golf game can touch.  These course numbers will continue to grow and grow once the CourseForge tool comes out and also once the developers start making licensed courses available.Online play is great with turn based multiplayer and the ability to tee off with up to 8 players.  You can stop and resume your round at a later time.  There are loads of different play modes available in PerfectGolf.  If tournaments are your thing you can participate in many online as well as ones ononlinegolftour.net.  The game also has a cool replay feature that allows you to watch the last shot from a number of different angles.  Your opponent(s) can see the replays as well.Another big plus for PerfectGolf is the freecam mode which allows you to more effectively read putts and scope out your next shot, even while your online opponent is getting ready to hit.  Take a virtual tour of the entire course from every conceivable angle and soak in the wonderful immersion that this game provides.PerfectGolf has lived up to its potential as superb golf simulation.  Every update over the last year has shown improvement, especially the most recent update from last month.  This community driven game will only get better in the months and years to come.  Be sure to give it a try and you won't be disappointed."

These devs are on top of things and have been relesing updates at a blistering pace. AND it has only been on EA release for about 2 weeks -- if only all EA were this refined and updated as frequently ! I am enjoying it immensely and look forward to the Course Forge coming for PG. I could wish for a course designer as easy as that of TGC but will wait and see.....

So far this is the most realistic golf game I played in a while.However, a few items are missing from the beta:-	A career mode-	Easier options to choose a flop, punch shots.  When you are in the rough on the other side of a bunker you should still have a loft option.-	Bots to play match-play against.  Not always possible to complete an 18 hole match play against real people.  Against bots you can play a few holes at a time until the game is complete.Really looking forward to the final version of the game."

The physics while still being tweaked in this EA version are awesome. The game can challenge you as much as you want which is a great thing. Golf is a game with so many variables and this game really brings that to life. You can dribble a ball off the tee or bust it 300 yards down the middle. All dependent on the quality of the swing you make. Just looking forward to how this game improves with the final version and all the courses that will be released. I couldn't imagine a better start a golf sim than what these guys have given us with the hard work they have put in. If you really like playing golf in real life and would like a PC version that replicates it then this is the one for you!

It looks lovely and offers what I always wanted in a golf game visually and physically.Little things like the player model clipping through severe slopes and clubs not being obviously accessible can be overlooked at this stage because the core of the game works well enough. There were very minor visual things that actually bothered me. The courses look wonderful, and the ball physics are pretty close to spot on which swayed me to buy it. My only real gripe is I'd like a fixed player camera, having the camera zoom in on the ball after impact gets a bit annoying after every shot.Right now I'd recommend it because if this turns out to have its own easy to use course editor/creator, and has all of the important tweaks and suggestions addressed, then right now for a golf sim, it is a total steal.

76561198035156249,Recommended,288140,14500721,"Posted: 16 February, 2015",all,[LG] ComplexP,"I've been playing golf and computer games for about 25 years now, ever since I was about seven years old, so I feel reasonably qualified to comment on something that combines the two.The early access of Perfect Golf is a fantastic start and the devs appear to have every motivation to bring the game to full fruition. Unlike many early access titles, the devs at Perfect Golf aren't promising heaven and earth just to get people's money but they are promising to create a great golf sim for real golfers, something I firmly believe they are very capable of delivering.The current basic build is solid and enjoyable enough to hint at what is to come. Of course it has some bugs and it is missing many features and some areas require polish but these are all being identified and dealt with systematically and professionally as far as I can tell.For anyone looking to buy this game in its current form, note that it does not yet have the following features which some may want to wait for:- Computer opponents- Career mode- Golfer appearance customisation- Statistics and TrackingI would also say that, while the game looks very nice on my machine in ultra high detail at 1080p (you need a proper gaming graphics card here by the way), the golfer animation could be doing with being more fluid and the feeling more solid when the ball is struck or impacts the turf. It just feels a little floaty at this point with the golfer, terrain and ball all having a slightly disconnected feel. Additionally, the wind conditions seem to have no effect on the trees or flag; at 50mph the trees move identically to when the wind is at 10mph.On the other hand, the in flight ball physics are awesome and the mouse control ""motionswing"" mechanic is brilliant and is easily the closest feel to a real golf swing that I've experienced in a PC golf game. This mechanism puts the onus on the tempo and rhythm of your swing rather than just how straight you can move the mouse back and through (anyone remember table edging?). Downswing too fast and the ball is going left, too slow and it's going right, similar to real golf. If you let the pressure get to you and you lose your tempo, you're in trouble, just like real golf.Also, the real time weather and sky conditions make everything feel a lot more realistic and help with immersion.At this point there are no computer opponents and no sort of career mode but these are planned. Additionally, there is no golfer or gear customisation beyond being able to select which 14 clubs you want in your bag.If you are a new starter (or even if you're not), here are my top ten tips for bringing down your scoring and increasing your enjoyment of the game:1) go to options and change the camera to track your shot because it's a static camera by default which is boring2) bring up the map using the button on the top right of the screen to allow for easier aiming3) right clicking in the power circle allows you to change club and select normal or chip shot type4) right clicking again in the power circle allows you to alter the trajectory or add fade/draw bias5) read the instructions and practice with motionswing. It may be tough to start with but it's worth it when it clicks!6) The marker on the putting green has nothing to do with power, only direction. The centre point on the putting power bar is the power needed to reach the hole on a flat green. You need to go past this point if you want to putt uphill7) activate the terrain slope graphics for normal shots as well as putts because the ball being above or below the feet will send the ball left or right respectively8) wind seems to have smaller effects on the ball than in other golf games but once the speed goes above 20mph it starts to have more of an impact9) go into your golfer settings and swap something out for a 64deg wedge. This is easily the most useful club in the bag behind the driver and the putter10) if you want to chat in a multiplayer game, hit enterAs far as multiplayer goes, it is currently based on a peer to peer hosting system with the normal modes of play you would expect and a few unusual ones. Since there is no central server yet you need to ensure you have a fast and stable internet connection if you are going to host a game. Otherwise, ask someone with a better connection to be the host. My experiences have been mostly positive as both host and guest with no disconnections but perhaps I have been lucky with my opponents.From memory I think there are 6 courses currently to choose from and new ones are being added regularly as part of the updates.If you are a fan of golf and you are looking for a proper golf simulator you should buy this game now.If you enjoy golf games in general but want a career mode, customisable equipment and computer opponents, check back in 6-12 months.If you want to pretend you are a superhuman who can drive the ball 400 yards and impart spin with the power of your mind, go play Tiger Woods."

I would add though that the course that i played on seemed lifeless, i mean it would be great even in solo play to see some other people or a caddy or something. Also noticed a little bit of jitter on the comet trail when the ball starts to drop after the peak of the shot.AI is needed for solo playThe only other bad thing i can think of is the sound design, in florida glades i can hear the ambience track looping. This may not sound like that big of a gripe but once you notice it it becomes infuriating and to have the same sound effect on all 18 holes in the track... well just play it and you will understand. I dont know if this is the same in the other courses but this must be a testament to how good the game is i cant wait to find out cos it is a brilliant game.Also. this is early access but i couldnt help but notice there is a pro shop... all the values are $0 at the moment but i cant help but wonder if this is going to become a game that ends up cashing in big style after its release. If you can win money during games thats okay but if you are going to be asking $200 for a golf club that absolutely obliterates any competition this game is going to go south fast!Other than that early access is good i like it and i will continue to play more of it..

Well done to the team at Perfect Parallel! Listen to your users and implement what is practical and achievable and a magnificent game will result.I did enjoy comments from another reviewer regarding the ""emergent physics"" used. If this is the differentiator to other golf sims then with further gameplay and feature development this has the potential to be better than the Green Jacket wearer of golf games being Links Golf.Works well on my 18 month old MAC. A little ""choppy"" at times but still adjusting graphics settings to find the sweet spot.I'm a keen golfer playing off 12 and much prefer the sim style of game, i.e. rounds of 65s - 80s and NOT the 50s you'd often see at the top of leaderboards on Links.

However, I still feel that this game has a good foundation to build on with the current meters.

Most of the things I would say need to be fixed have already been touched on by other reviewers. However, I would have to differ in my opinion of the severity of the negative comments.

The big difference for me is the swing mechanic. On the higher difficulty settings the real-time-swing actually requires a skilled effort at the swing. Other games I have played recently (such as TGC) are OK but the swing on those just seems so easy - also like you go on auto-pilot when swinging - and gets a little boring. Not so with Perfect Golf as you need to pay attention to your swing.I also like that the physics of the game determine where the ball ends up - it is not predetermined as some other games are.Graphics are decent as well, but I don't have a high end video card and so cannot comment much on that aspect. All I can say is that it is comparable to other recent PC golf titles I have played.As for the number and variety of courses, it is getting better now with more user-designed courses being released.  In my opinion the variety and quality of courses is what is important rather than sheer numbers. Currently, even in early access, I see variety of courses in Perfect Golf getting better and better. They are quality tracks with a good range of difficulties available.  As the Perfect Golf course designing community grows there will be even more courses of varying visual styles getting released on top of an already great set of courses."

You can't make a game that looks sooo pretty but plays terribly. I have played every Links Golf Series, ive played PGA Tour on the Ipad, ive probably played every golf sim since the Atari 800 XL The control of the power bar is completely rediculous the swinginmg is way way way off. If you move your golfers position farther to the left and then take a swing and it misses the mark and goes just a little bit the ball curves to the left WAY WAY WAY left not equalling the strength and the way the ball should be going. The Physics are all wrong. The Mouse buttons to stop on the swingdown is not consistant and sometimes it does not respond ir it responds late and the swing goes way to the left or the right.  There are not any cheers or announcers.  Links 2003 a game that is 12 years old plays better than this game, it may not look as animated and as perty as this game but at least you can have fun playing the game. This being said this is still in BETA and Im really hoping this game improves cause wasting $20 doesnt make me a happy camper.UPDATE**************** Ok im Liking it more the past 2 days. Ive figured out that i can change the settings to make it easier for starters. I was playing the Pro setting. Also the swing is easier than i thought HOWEVER its way too sensitive sending the ball right or left even if your barey left or right of the downswing marker. I have a pretty good PC with lots of memory and 3 core etc the graphics are very choppy when set to best, so I lowered it and it playes great and even though its not on the highest settings it looks 420X better than LINKS, Tiger Woods etc..

But reading some of the other comments that may be just something about the latest release (it doesn't get any better using the lower graphics settings either).

As regards the gameplay in particular, it is indeed excellent, although even at the easiest setting the shot meter is very unforgiving. A slight miss off the center line, left or right, yields an erring shot in no man's land. So you better hone your reflexes. That caveat notwithstanding, the game is great fun. Kudos to the developers at this stage of development.Now, on the less positive side: the graphics are nice, but a bit disappointing, if we consider that they are roughly on par with the graphics in the game Links 2003. I must say, however, that I am here comparing the best and most recent offerings of this old game, with respect to available courses, and the likes of Shardowlands in Perfect Golf. Still I find that the vegetation, especially the foliage of leafy trees, could and should be better, more polished and photo realistic. I would likewise welcome some flowers in places to add a touch of color and variety to this green fest. Also, even with the antialiasing on, there are still some noticeable jagged edges. Keep in mind that I have the graphical settings at ultra high, with max resolution of 1440 P. In short, I believe there is still work to be done on the part of the developers when it comes to graphics.Clearly, and quite predictably at this stage, there is also a lot of work to be done when It comes to available courses, clubs, and avatars. Furthermore, I would love to see an array of AI opponents of different skill levels for off-line games.I suggest Perfect Parallel include a store in the game to give the option of considerably expanding the content at a reasonable cost. I personally have no issue with financially rewarding the developers (like the competent course designer Mike Jones) for this most promising game. Yes, I am hooked, albeit with some reservations at the present time. I am truly burning with anticipation, thinking of what is to follow for us golf lovers.Let us hope for the best."

It has the look and feel of the PGA Championship PC game that I used to play, but Perfect Golf has the advantage of a strong and growing on-line capability thanks to STEAM. I have just several minor complaints about the game.First, I wish that the wind was more of a factor in the game to make players think a little more about how to shape shots. Clever  players could then hit fades and draws on purpose to hold the ball against the wind, or use the wind more to move around dogleg corners depending on the situation.Second, I don't believe that players are penalized enough when hitting into or out of the trees. I have seen many shots go right through the trees like they were thin air, when in real golf the tree limbs or leaves would have knocked the ball down. Fairway bunker shots also seem a little too easy compared to real golf.Lastly, I suspect that some of the players out there that are using the Motion Plus method to swing the club are using a track or some other kind of aid to move their mouse perfectly each time. It's too much of a coincidence that they have the same shot shape everytime, especially when consistently hitting it with over 100% power. That creates an unfair advantage over those players who use the tri-click method. I recommend that you allow just the tri-click method for on-line play to guarantee that no player has an advantage over any other."

Didn't have to spend a year to learn the game as you can be shooting in the seventies by the second round as I was. It is not easy from there. It shall be many months before I could claim a round average in the low seventies even playing on the easier of the two modes of operation and on the easiest of four settings within that mode. You will get value for money with this game as I see myself never mastering it. The quality of the courses I believe are of a very high standard, better than any other golf sim to date. The in flight ball physics are, in my opinion, near perfect.  Some other ball physics, not so good. Irregular bounce and bounce height need to be tweaked, ball travels too freely through heavy long grass, inconsistent spin on and around greens and ball holds on a bunker face. There is no lie indicator and once on the green the putting, in general, I found it to be a little easy.But it is early access and as it is with early access there is some work to do which the PP team are already at it. I have no doubt that the team behind this game have their hearts in it and in my opinion they are in this for the long haul, because of this I am unable to see this venture falling over.

The courses are great and look realistic, ball flight and physics is pretty much spot on. You can tell a lot of hard work has gone into the making of this game, ensuring that it looks and feels like real golf.

The game, at this point, will not dazzle you with its graphics (I'm playing all graphics options maxed out, btw), but what it lacks in glitz, it makes up for with the truest golf mechanics and 'feel' that I've yet come across in a golf video game.I originally started out with the 3-click meter, because that's what I would normally default to after toying around with other games' motion swings (be it the Wiimote, PS controller or mouse).  However, after deciding to give this game's motion swing a try, I'm hooked.    Finally, a game that nails it.  The motion swing is fantastic.   It feels natural and organic, whether on the full swing, chipping or putting.    It's also deep, and difficult (playing with the assists at 'minimal') but with practice, you see improvement as you start to gain feel and muscle memory, just like in real golf.   The game also provides you with numerical feedback (on the driving range practice mode) to illustrate the errors and there is a guide on Steam that explains the numbers.  In short, there are 3 components - tempo, swing path and face contact, all determined by the speed and directions you move your mouse.The core game is solid.  Once they put some more spit and polish on this and throw in the course forge and other features, it may just be the definitive golf sim that people have been waiting forever for."

It also is very cumbersome when putting.One feature which is missing is the ablitly to view the green prior to shooting, I'm not sure why that would be omitted but I'm sure it will be in at some point.Good start.

This game is still in the Pre release stage (10/15) and updating gameplay and features.  I have played all the courses and used the different settings and features.With just a standard mouse $7 cheapo the game plays pretty good and has the overall feel of golfing on the course. You can play 3 Click or with Mouse swing currently. The courses they have so far are really nice and some you will be able to remember seeing before as they are real PGA golf courses. Scoring was not too bad, it does depend on the level you play with and how well you can do with the controls on the system you have. I managed to break par on beginner, but Pro level has still kept me over par.There is a gameroom and multiplayer to find matches. They have also just introduced AI golfers that you can set up to play matches with you as well.  There are several different gameplay options like strokeplay, skins, matchplay, etc.. You can change the weather, wind, stimp of the greens, tees. and other settings to increase difficulty.A Course Designer is coming called The Course Forge that really looks nice.  It does need to be used with Unity to lay out the Base Terrain. After you make your initial terrain you would use the CF to apply the different fairways, greens, bunkers, distances, tees, course objects, etc....If you are looking for a Golf Game that gives you a challenge and feels like playing golf I would say go for it.Perfect Golf will make you think twice about how your are going to play that next shot."

When the dust settles among various golf titles, I anticipate this will be the one with greatest longevity and player base.

There are times when I enjoy it more than the real thing, simply because I score better.I do, however, have one major complaint, that being the lack of a full range of practice facilities. In the real world I spend much of my golf time practicing the short game; pitching, chipping, putting and sand traps. Unfortunately all one can really do in PG in the way of practice is go to the range.  I do find aspects of the short game hard to adjust to in PG (particularly chipping weight) and would welcome the opportunity to be able to go to a practice green, place my ball wherever I wish, and try different clubs, swing types, etc.I would like to think this is in the works and can appreciate the challenges it may create, however to be ranked a great, if not the greatest golf game, it simply has to be part of the package.

The Devs have obviously worked very hard to add so much to the game, Such as new swing methods, including  real time mouse swing and real time controller swing. I think the controller swing will be a big plus to those that have played golf games on xbox  or playstation. Also now available for free are user made courses. While the Course forge has not been released yet to the general public those that were Beta testing it made some courses which you can now download and play in the game. This in itself is a huge step forward and with them being free it should open the doors for many that were a bit hesitant about the game. The life blood in my opinion of a golf game is the ability to add courses and play them for free. I know this was not the direction that  the game first looked at going but PP have listened to the feed back of the community and have changed their mind. This was a game breaker decision for me and probably for many more. The fact that PP listened and heard all the pro's and con's of free user made courses then decided that this is what the community wanted in itself  is not a small thing. How many times with other games have suggestions been made but fall on deaf ears. I can assure you I know of more then one or two. This isn't the only time that PP has listened to the community and either changed something or improved on it. That is huge for instilling confidence as a consumer that they actually do read the forums and not just pay lip service to it.When course forge is released to the public the list of courses will grow by a vast margin as many of us will try our hand at designing. Now some will fiddle with it and give up but others will hang in there to try and grasp all the challanges it will bring. Still the thought of getting real terrain data and to be able to create a real course with realistic terrain and elevation has me very excited. I too wondered if it was ever going to see the light of day but with this new update there is no doubt in my mind it will happen.So if you want to try a different kind of golf game of one where the devs do  listen to the community (That of course doesn't mean we always get our way but heck at least they take the time to respond and explain why they choose a way of doing something ) Then don't hesitate to get the game. I think in the near future you will see even bigger and better things to come and if you love to play golf games now is the time to get in on the action. Come check it out at the PP forums. Yes there is a lot of different topics to sort through but you may be glad you did. I know I am."

76561198134826749,Recommended,288140,21323556,"Posted: 19 February, 2016",all,Armand,"In a few words,this is anexcellentcomputer golf game!It is quite advanced for an early access title.  The game can be very challenging or more relaxing, depending on what level you choose to play at and what aids you select to help your golfing experience.  I think eveyone can find a method to play to make Perfect Golf one of the most enjoyable golf games you've ever played.  I wouldhighlyrecommend this game to all computer golfers!What follows in this review is a lengthy discussion of some of the features (not all of them) provided in the game - analogous to the list of options the game provides!I bought Perfect Golf when it first became avialable in Early Access.  I played the Links series of golf, and played a very small bit with the PGA/TW series.  To me, PG is bit more similar to Links than TW games, but it's not a new version of Links.  The game developments over the first 13 months of early access have come reasonably steadily and each one providing new features and bug fixes of the reported issues.  I have complete faith that this will continue for however long early access continues; with the present state of the game, I suspect it won't be much more than a few more months until release (but that is only my guess).The game requires surprisingly (to me) high hardware requirements to get the most detail from the game.  The most important thing is you video card.  You really need to have a dedicated video card; an on-board video card will not deliver the experience that players will want, even at the lowest quality settings of the game.  However, lower end systems and middle-of-the-road systems with dedicated video cards can generally run the game reasonably well.Perfect Golf can be a very difficult golf game - perhaps as difficult as the real game for some.  However, there are many aids that can be employed to make the game more relaxing.  There are currently four options for input methods:- a ""traditional"" style 3-click swing meter suing the mouse button- game controller with thumbstick on the personal computer- mouse movement, now available in a real-time format, so the golfer swings as you move the mouse- golf simulator hardware (Trackman 3/4, Foresight GC2, SkyTrack)The 3C swing uses a round meter which is pretty familiar to most computer golf players.  I believe the 1.3.9.0 update coming in February 2016 will have an option to make the player avatar move as 3C swing meter moves.  I'm not familiar with the controller methods, so I can't comment on this input method.  The mouse movement method allows you to change the direction of movement from vertical to horizontal as well as the sensitivity to allow for various DPI settings in your mouse configuration as well as various resolution settings for the game itself (4K, HD, VGA, etc.).  The mouse swing can optionally be set as a real-time swing.  I also cannot comment on the simulator input, but from what I've read from those fortunate to have simulator hardware, all very much enjoy Perfect Golf.I really enjoy the challenge of the game using a horizontal mouse swing.  I haven't tried the real-time swing yet, but I definitely will be giving it a go.  I like how you can control the ball movement by making a different path with the mouse, and thus imparting draw/hook spin or fad/slice spin as required for the shot.  The physics of sideslopes, uphill/downhill lies, wind and elevation effects in the game provide the most realistic ball flight I've seen in golf games.Courses designed in the Course Forge by users wil become avilable for all players very soon.  The previews of the courses as well as a few that have been released by Perfect Parallel with the game so far have been very good.  I suspect there will be many more coming, but I also suspect they will all of be good quality and not something slapped together in a few minutes or hours.There are many modes of play (stroke/medal play, solo/team match play, and others) as well as the option to play online against other live players from around the world.  There are limimted number of official tournaments at this time, but other web sites, such as the Online Golf Tour or OGT, provide a very good complement to Perfect Golf.  I suspect after the game is release, Perfect Parallel will provide more official tournaments, but it's always good to have optiosn with other tournament providers as well!  OGT will also host user-created courses for free download/addition to the game.One of the few drawbacks in the 1.3.9.0 build of the Perfect Golf may be the lack of a career mode.  Many computer golfers want this, but it won't be provided by Perfect Parallel until after the release of the game.  The ongoing development of the game after release should ensure that a detailed and realistic career mode will be provided, based on the attention to detail and reality that Perfect Parallel have exhibited in the game thus far.  I have no doubt that whatever is eventually provided will be very enjoyable.Perfect Golf is currently only available on the computer (Windows, Mac, Linux), but Perfect Parallel have indicated it will be ported to XBox One and PS4, although no timetable has been provided.  Again, I strongly recommend Perfect Golf for any computer golf fan.  It's a steal for the price and will likely provide many hours of entertainment!!"

The game was fantastic when I first got it and has only improved in the short time I've been playing it.  As far as simulation is concerned, it can't be topped.  It has hands down the best golf physics ever created for a golf game.  All types of shots play exceptionally well with my launch monitor.  Full shots, short game shots, putting, you name it the physics are spot on.  The game has great camera views, game modes, multiplayer play is solid on steam, tournament APIs.

In addition what really sets it apart is that developers participate almost daily at the PG forum and listen to the PG community.  There is going to be a significant update in the next day or so and to me describing this game as early access is not doing it justice.  The philosophy of the designers is to create the most realistic computer golf game yet and in my  opinion they have already achieved that.  I highly recommend this for anyone who plays the real game or  wants to learn about the golf while having fun.

Real life golf is frustrating, but very rewarding if you can achieve success, and to do that, it takes some work.  This game is the same way, you have to put some time in to get some success - but it can be fun on the way due to the high quality courses available upon which to play.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the quailty of the courses, both the ones supplied by default in the game, and the user designed courses which so far have proven to be of as high a quality as the default courses.My favorite method of play (swing type) is the newly implemented Real Time Swing - Motion Swing which is proving to be very immersive giving you the feeling that you are really on a golf course and not sitting in front of a computer.Some of the new courses and swing type changes is stirring more interest in this game and there is quite a community of active players who hang out in the lobby for online multiplayer games.  There is also a site which offers weekly tournaments seemlessly integrated into the game with nearly 100 players signed up at the tour pro level (the one I play).  I do not know how many play in the other level tournaments, I suspect that it is 100s more.  There are currently no additional costs to fully participate in the game, courses, lobby or tournaments (although the tournament host does solicit donations on the website through a button).  Eventually there will be premium content for purchase (licensed courses, and accesories which will only be cosmetic and not give you an advantage in the game), but that content will not be necessary to enjoy the game.There will be a program called course forge which will allow anyone who purchases this game to design beautiful course the same way that the original ones were developed.  The current crop of user developed courses were designed by beta testers of course forge.  Course forge will come out when the game exits Early Access, probably sometime this year (but don't quote me).Pluses - gameplay is rich, not repetitive, due to realistic physics and variabilityinterest in the game is growing, lots of partners/opponents availabledeveloper is active, listens to gamers suggestions and incorporates improvementsgame works on multiple platforms including golf simulatorsMinuses - game requires modern computer graphics power to enjoy smooth gameplayplayers who want instant gratification may be disappointed with learning curveMy advice is to purchase this game while it is still in Early Access as it will surely be more than $20 when it is fully released."

A recent update added quite a few community made courses (along with updates to the stock courses in the game) and also added several new swing styles.A wide range of swing styles are available:Traditional 3-click with a power meterMotion Swing with the mouse that has a meter on the screen (your choice of swinging horizontally or vertically)Real Time Swing with the mouse (your choice of swinging horizontally or vertically.  No meter on the screen but the player animation moves in concert with the mouse movement)Real Time Swing with a controllerThe game can also be played on a home golf simulator.The motion swings are my personal favorites.  Tempo has a large part in determining the outcome of the shot (as well as swing path and heel/toe hits)  so it's not as simple as straight back/straight through.  A truly wonderful way to play PC golf.There are also a wide range of difficulty options so you can jump right in and enjoy the game.  The easier levels are a great introduction to the game.  Casual player or just want to have a fun round?  It's here.The highest levels of difficulty are quite tough but it doesn't feel unfair or gimmicky.  If you can control your swing, you can still score well.  If you're not playing well, it can be a real grind, but  it is so rewarding when you put a good swing on the ball.  A great option for the hardcore sim player.The course designs are beautiful and the ball physics are the best I've seen in a PC golf game.  A wide range of stimp settings are available for the green speeds, several firmness settings for the fairways, and several settings for pin positions.Currently there are about 33 courses in the game, as well as a large driving range and a short game practice area.The game is still in Early Access so things are still being worked on.  Things not yet included in the game but are planned for the future:-Career mode-Assortments of clothing/animations/clubheads/balls/shafts etc...-Course building software-More courses-Improved AI for the CPU players-Country clubs and tournamentsThere currently is a REALLY good third party tournament site that hosts weekly tournaments for various skill levels as well as fun ancillary events.They have an automatic scoring system set up that will keep track of your scores and stats after each round and maintains them on their site.

76561198103370075,Recommended,288140,21722539,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Sidd,"I have been waiting for a golf sim, and the early access of Perfect Golf seems to be headed in the right direction. Obviously, with an early access, there are things that are needed and things that are fine as is. So far, I can say confidently that the heart is beating in this game. Visually it's appealing and the game-play engine itself is a good start. Some of the issues at this point, I hesitate to mention, again because I suspect every feature and tweak I would like to see has been accounted for by the developers and they are working on it. That being said:The menus need work and making changes to the settings on the fly is clunky. The types of shots are limited at the moment and needs attention, as does the power meter and putting helpers. Right now, they don't really make much sense and seem arbitrary. There's no way to punch shots through or accurately alter spin the way the real game allows. The power meters and putting grids also are somewhat of a mystery and don't seem to be designed to let the player really know exact measurements. This may be on purpose, but still this is a sim and not real life, so we need some way to benchmark our swings and fades, etc...It needs a player history system so I can go back and review my previous rounds, and of course, it needs more courses. I hope most of all, the developers are going to be able to make a deal with the PGA for rights to their courses and tournament play, but even if it remains simply a non-PGA golf simulation, that's fine on its own. If you want to learn the game and progress without getting bored, I think this will be a good title someday. I hope it is sooner than later.added: May 5, 2016:Now that the supposed general release has been pushed out, I felt I need to comment further on this game. As I said in my earlier review, the heart of a good game was there, and I was hoping Perfect Parrellel was working hard on the serious issues in the engine. Apparently, they are working harder on the marketing and getting Jack Nicklaus to put his name on a game that is FAR, FAR from finished.I'm wondering if the makers of this game couldn't care less about the gamers in Steam and are more interested in the Golf Simulators out there than can use this software. Because right now, us gamers are getting no love from the game.A few points for the developers, which I hope read this:...The putting mechinism is simply awful. Damn near unplayable. It's swing mechanics are inconsistent and clunky. There is no context to the power of the swing and they give little to no credible way to read the greens. It needs serious re-tooling before this game can be considered top notch....there is no way to craft shots and the chipping and pitching is abysmal and inconsitent. You'll never hit the same shot twice in the same conditions....the swing meter, which is the only way most gamers are going to play this game, is baffling and inconsistent. it gives no power context either but even if it did, you can never re-create shots no matter how hard you try.I'm holding out hope this will improve, but if this is now considered a released game, I'm not holding my breath that major changes to the engine are coming.updated: June 17...a few of the patches and fixes are helping on some of the issues I pointed out in May. Putting seems to have normalized somewhat. It's getting better about giving enough clues to read a green. Still, I think the grid needs to be smaller squares and the BLI is a little clunky, but better....still though, chipping and pitching are so frustrating. Practice is one thing, but inconsistency in the UI and the game engine is something else. Pitching and chipping still is a nightmare of randomness. Random in that you never ever know how your chip or pitch is going to react in any situation. it's impossible to recreate a shot that has the same variables and the engine will flatout fail you by over shooting or undershooting even though the power, lie and variables might be the same. NEEDS ATTENTION NOW....crafting shots is still a major problem. the shot maker function just doesn't work for lowering or raising your trajectory. It works left and right, but not up and down....still worth it, as this is a simulation and not an arcade, ,and as long as they don't morph into a pay to win model, I will continue to recommend it."

Pretty sure there is something for everyone.I settled in on real time mouse swing as that works well for me in other games. This game gives that swing with a twist in that tempo is also needed for a good swing.Ooodles of game play levels. Plenty of options and feedback with the practice areas to hone your game control type. Game has a significant learning curve at higher and harder levels which is right up my alley as i like practicing as much as playing. At higher and harder levels the game will tax your cranium to score well and hit good solid shots.Game is constantly improving and developers are trying to make a hard golf game. Golf is supposed to be hard, so I give extra kuddo's to the vision. However there are levels in the game that also make game play easy, so something for everyone in here.Competitions and career come from outside fan sites, I have not had the opportunity to fully explore these yet, however they look OK. Fan sites can tend to rid themselves of good players looking to elevate their clique using various BS excuses, so time will tell if this also plaques this game or not.  However in any event the developers have been working on and are improving on computer generated opponets for players looking to compete against like skilled players. The game also has a lobby, something I have also not fully explored however it looks easy enough to find friends and fellow golfers to play with.Current crop of courses are visually pleasing, and the game play at the higher levels of difficulty make replaying the same courses not at all boring. Additional courses can also be downloaded. You can read reviews and look at videos and photos of courses before deciding to add them to your stable of courses.Developer also has a future plan to give course design to everyone.

This is the real deal.The game can be as hard as you want it to be. Want to go easy on a flat green course using 3 point click on Beginner? Go for it. After a while, you'll birdie too often and want more of a challenge. No problem. There's Hacker, Amateur, Tour, and Tour Pro that'll challenge you further. These higher difficulties make swing timings more precise, resulting in shots more prone to shank if you're off just a bit. At the highest levels, you won't even be told the wind speed or direction and will have to rely on visual cues like the flag's movement. This says nothing of additional round settings like wind speeds (which can be set to weather forecasts), pin placements, green firmness, etc. You'll botch plenty of shots at first until you practice to get your swing down while you learn to master both courses and conditions. Just like in real golf.Beyond that, there are different swing styles that change ball striking experience. Want to feel like you're actually swinging something on your PC without a gamepad? Motion Swing allows you to use your mouse as a club to swing. You'll have to literally swing back and forward both straight and within a backswing-to-forwardswing time frame ratio in order to hit your shot straight. If you have a controller, you can use joysticks.This is a game with a great deal of depth and multiplayer replayability with a learning curve as steep as you make it. Still, the game launched a bit prematurely. The multiplayer lobby is quirky, at best; dysfunctional, at worst. Computer opponents are wildly inconsistent, too, so to play a decent opponent, you'll have to put up with the lobby's quirkiness or practice on your own.In spite of all of this, if you're pleased enough with the gameplay, you'll be patient in waiting for patches to remedy the game's weaknesses.There are negative reviews about season passes that are misinformed. These passes are for additional equipment you can buy to actually hit golf balls into a net and track their flight in-game, which seems like a pretty dang cool add-on if you ask me. The developers are in no way forcing customers to pay for the base game and a season pass to play for a year.The store also offers additional courses to purchase—currently Bethesda for $4.99. There is unwarranted outcry about this as well because the game comes bundled with plenty of courses to keep the gameplay varied enough for a good while—14 full courses if my count is right, and 2 practice ranges. Offering additional DLC content to the core game is exactly what a lot of developers do these days. It's not in the base game, so therefore, you pay more for it. Sounds fair enough.All in all, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. I do hope the developers continue to flesh out the kinks, but they've managed to produce a very solid game with gameplay that'll keep you coming back for more if the sort of golf sim you're looking for is both realistic and increasingly challenging. These two strengths make the game that much more rewarding and fun when you do get a handle on things and are able to be competitive against others in multiplayer matches."

The graphics leave much to be desired, considering its 2015, the graphics are reminiscent of a game released in the late 90’s, I am sure that will also be improved in time.There are currently only a few limited courses, unlike TGC (The Golf Club, by HB Studios) there is no course creator, so there are no community submitted courses to play on, which is a real shame as it’s something that would attract more players to this game.  This game has been developed for PC and I think it’s due for release on the consoles too.It's now been several months on since this game was released. Its had many patchs which has improved this game even more. The graphics are still retro, but there is talk of improving this soon. As far as golf sim's go, then there is nothing out there that gets close to it. The game play is really solid and improves with each patch released.The introduction of AI and the horizontal swing meter has in my opinion improved this game even better. The AI still needs some tweaking, but it's great to play against the computer, and you can also adjust the AI's skill level.As I've mentioned before this is the only true golf sim out there, so a lot of practice is required if you want to play this game well.Is it worth the price?..Hell yes, if you love golf, then make sure you have this in your bag. The introduction of an editor will soon make this a better game to play...."

When your talking SIM, this is as close as you can get with any golf game on the market. The ability to score takes skill, knowledge of golf, and desire. After playing 18 hrs I have finally begun to get down to just about par.After playing wgt, twg, and other games, this one by far takes golf SIM to new heights with their new swing motion. I am enjoying playing this game more and more, and have over 130 courses at my disposal. I can understand why some get frustrated, they do not have the patience nor will to gradually become better. Instant gratification is what most desire in today's fast pace world. This game definitely evens the field up, and people don't like that as well.Ball effects for differing course agriculture may be better in the future, hopefully. I have seen that cart paths do not quite bounce the ball enough, ruff tends to slow the ball down a little but not enough. Trees do very well in deflecting balls correctly in this game, I love that aspect. Greens react quite well, and I am yet to see an animal exploded from my launched ball. The courses that others have made are first class, and there are many of them. Options for in game settings are awesome.Overall, this game takes some time to get good at. This is not a game for those who like arcade over SIM, i.e. pg2, twg over jnpg. If you are a true lover of golf on the real course you will not be disappointed in the accuracy of this game on computer. Bombs away!"

There are many flaws and inconsistancies in which the ball reacts vs the way it should. First, let's talk the short game. If I want to have the ball check up, I should be able to control it. This can not happen in the game. There is no stopping the ball once it lands on the green. It is all roll out so lets hope you have alot of green to work with. Sand shots should be able to get spin on them if the lie is clean and the landing area on the green is flat or up hill. This does not happen. again its all role out. Hit it thin or fat? Ok I get that. but missing the snap by a 10th of a fraction and you are penalized!!. c'mom folks get real. Putting: Not really an issue, except. too many lip outs when the ball speed is at a rate and location that would allow it to drop. If the intention is to have all puts drop in the centre cup, then make the hole smaller! otherewise, lighten up on the speed to gravity ratio. AND Why does the ball get spit out of the cup once it drops? Yep. happened twice. slow putt. in the heart, drops in the cup and a half second later it is spit out like old chewing gum. One more thing: I dont mind the forgiveness adjustment on missing the meter whith most tee shots and fairwar approaches, but lets make it equal or relative to all clubs, wedges and Putter. I have up until now really enjoyed playing the game. I am not an ""exceptional"" player, below par sometines, above par sometimes, but now, i find that the game is no longer an enjoyable exercise.

No fps's, fast rts's or sports games, just click and click some more.  This is perfect in that regard.  Unfortunately though, whie easy to play, the graphics are painfully dull and the ambiance needs work.  If you're going to stare at the screen at least make the textures detailed or the models more defined.  The default character golfer is pretty low poly, now whether that's a design decision because they're using Unity, I don't know, but I've seen higher poly assets in other games on the same platform.  There's not much in terms of default animation with the golfer either, not that he should scratch himself with the putter, but like other games, whn you're lining up a shot you move or adjust your positions from looking at the hole, crouching to line things up and then finally taking the shot.  The scenery as I said, the ambiance needs work.  Skies, clouds, birds, water, grass and shrubbery, all just sits with a simple state to move a bit.  Just small amounts of movement.  I'm not asking for somebody to throw a pie, but if it's going to be a pc game, put some graphical power behind it.  I maxed the graphics, but still, nohing cool besides maybe a lens flare, but lens flares aren't cool...so here we are.Gameplay, yeah there's multiplayer and you can set up games with friends, but that's standard these days.  No silly side games or practice shooting in a range.  Just dive in and it's pretty shallow.I bought this for a twenty but that's a bit much, had I known what to expect I'd say it's maybe worth a fiver.  I wouldn't mind a refund but I won't lie, it's easy to play and it'll be great when I'm drunk trying to kill time.  My standards tendt to lower.I'd say save your money for a bigger studio release.

The game is playing much better these days. Find myself trying to get a round in almost every day. Maybe the time away and the updates when I booted up after some time off did the trick. I run on a pretty quality system so I don't know if system quality (or lack thereof) explained the earlier issues. All that aside, it is running pretty smooth now. I'm starting to really enjoy it again. I have a few gripes but they're pretty minor. Would like to control spin more, especially on wedge shots. Can't seem to get legitimate back spin ever. That said, I love the challenge this game takes to shoot a solid score.At this point, I'd really like to see the accessibility to the other features of the game get easier. I don't have any steam ""friends"" who play the game so I can never get in on any multiplayer matches. Would be really nice if the companion site became a great resource for players of the game. I would love to enter more tournaments, access a ""career mode"" (I don't think that game mode is available yet), etc. Also, I have no idea how to download all these courses that I'm seeing people play on. Games like ""Banished"" have a simple subscription model for mods and additions to the game. I can't figure out how to add those for this game. This could very well be a case of my own ignorance.All in all, I'm changing my review to favorable from initially negative. Could be an awesome game in due time. Hopefully sooner than later!(Original Review Below)I can't seem to get this game to work. I bought it a long time ago from the early access and as far as I can tell the game has just gotten worse and it has been awhile since the release. I now can't even find a resolution acceptable enough in the graphics option for the game to work. Set the resolution too high, and the game is insanely laggy. Completely unplayable. Set the resolution to low and it's accompanied with a bunch of bugs. As I click the meter, the screen switches from wide screen zoom to regular, and then after I finish the swing, it goes completely black for a few seconds. Disappointed in the evolution of the game from the beginning. Best to focus only on smooth gameplay, and build from that. It seems the dev team has tried to add random features that really have never come to fruition and somehow they've compromised the quality of play along the way... Valiant effort. Still can be recovered I guess but we'll see."

The ability to play the game at a beginner level and then add complexity as personal skill and mastery of the game increases should keep interest up for a very long time. The fact that many courses are available now (some bundled with the game, one to purchase at this time, many on line by independent designers) is a further benefit for this game. I await the arrival of the Course Forge so I design some of my own courses.Some of the earlier reviews mention minor glitches in the basic game and in some of the add on courses. It seems that community comments about the problems bring about speedy updates. IMHO some of the glitches make the game more interesting if one keeps one's sense of humor. As an example, one course manifests a problem with the water hazzard which requires either learning how to play the bounce off the frozen surface or how safe is it to stand on the frozen surface while chipping back to the fairway. I  kind of hope they don't fix that one!This game is a definite thumbs up."

And I wasn't even expecting a lot to begin with. When it works, the overall gameplay may be decribed as passable or rudimentary at best. When it doesn't, you will be struggling with all manner of bugs, glitches, and inconsistencies. From frequent crashes, to graphical glitches, to loss of chat features/interface. Admittedly, I am running the game on a near minimum requirements spec PC, so others may have a technically superiour experience, but I am, for example, literally unable to play two rounds in a row as the game crashes to desktop every single time I try to load a second round.Motion swing controls are either broken or the developers simply don't understand what the whole point of being able to play by using your mouse as a club is. (It is to give the player the feel of actually swinging a club, in real time, and therefore requires 1:1 motion controls and respective visual representation. Another game achieved this perfectly, in 2001.)Underwhelming at best. Every chance it will improve down the road, but impossible to recommend at this stage, particularly to those with lower specced PCs."

Never was a huge fan of the mouse movement swing in any iteration of golf games on the PC since Leaderboard Golf on DOS/Commodore64.The microtransactions aren't too pricey or out of control either.  You start with a good dozen country clubs and can order for $6 or less new ones.  All the fancy cosmetics are unlocked by actually playing the game.I have yet to get a chance to try out the hotseat multiplayer, but that looks like it could bring back the good ole days of playing a bowling or golf game on the computer as a party game.All in all, I would say this is definitely worth a buy if you are into golf, and by far the best golf game currently out on SteamOS/Linux.This title runs perfectly under RHEL7 and Fedora 25 64bit."

There are many Golf sims and I have tried them all but following Microsofts decicion to no longer support Links after 2003 left many Golf players frustrated.  Links did however have an excellent course designer and they are lots of great designers out there who continued to support the game and gave the community loads of great courses to play.Two of the finest designers then started Perfect Parallel with the eventual aim of releasing this game.  I joined the kickstarter campaign and was thrilled when the game got the Green Light from Steam.  When the game finally arrived I was very dissapointed because the game looked great but didn't play very well.The engine lagged badly so I went back to Links I even made sure that I updated my graphics card to be compatible with Links when I upgraded my computer.  A year os so further on I have returned to this game and I can safetly say that this is a worthy successor to Links.The graphics are beautiful the game supports lots of swing types and you can impliment real time weather for most locations all over the world but these are just small details what's important is how the game plays.  A year on the game now plays flawlessly so even if you only like the occasional casual game of golf this is as goods as it gets.  Those serious about their armchair golf will already have it. One of the coolest  things about these games is the course designer.  The designer that came with Links was fit for purpose but course design was involved and time consuming to say the least.The designer for this game called Course Forge is simpler and more intuitive to use but is not yet available but is due imminently.There are already plenty of cources to download other than those that come with the game from the link on the introduction page from designers that have been given early access and the standards are awesome.  These are now being released at a rate of about 5 a month and this will accelerate once the Course Forge is availanle for all. It would be amazing to see further cources particularly some of the best designs from the Links series.  Mike Jones one of Links premier designers really needs to make the rest of his cources available for Perfect Golf time permitting.How about it Mike?  Who knows once the CF is ready I might just add 1 or 2 designs of my own. In the meantime I'm off to play the remaining cources that I've downloaded in rainy old Blighty.  Highly recommended.

It does keep changing, sometimes in little ways sometimes in surprising ways.After the last update, so much changed that I've stopped playing pretty much. It used to be fun. Tweak tweaks - now it's not fun; it's work and it has changes that I just cannot figure out how to adjust, why they made it, and how can I get back an older version? Putting is a real problem at the time I write this review, and it never was this much of an issue before. So I'm pretty tired of trying to re-learn this game every release. However, those releases also made some great improvements both visual and functional, and their active involvement has brought the game along nicely. (One reviewer seem to think there was no ""dev'elopment; I disagree: this game has one of the most devoted dev teams around.It has a lot of courses, many really good free ones; the basics are all there, it has several levels of play, all of which are too tough for this old guy, and enough free presonalization to make your game look good. They have big plans in the golf world and while some of the bells and whistles aren't there (never missed the crowd noise anyways, no fancy locker rooms to acess data, etc.) there's a lot there, almost everything can be controlled with sliders, it supports really nice graphics, There's an active lobby, several tournaments both 'official' and open, but all use levels of play above the starter level, so your controls may look different, and you may want to learn the higher levels of controls; me I have trouble enough on hacker, or whatever the lowest is.The game is very good at recovery, if you lose connections, or in multi-player, you have a good chance of picking up right where you left off. There's an active community base and an active forum, and an at-times chatty lobby.Overall it is a very well-designed (and still being designed) game with great emersion, simple to learn, hard to master; lots of features and options and seems to have a robust future.

It seems the longer the putt the shorter you have to move the mouse, completely opposite of what it should be.

Normally I have developed a reluctance towards EA games, but Perfect Golf truly delivers the experience I was looking for.> The graphics are simply beautyful. Lots of in-game tweaks possible to match the performance with your GPU setup;> The physics in the game are almost as true as you expect them to be and truly unforgiving if your not careful;> different swing types: 3-click, RTS, interface with various swing simulators;> Perfect Golf has about 12 courses that are included in the download. Via internet you can easily download other courses;> Multiplayer is fun. There are lots of possibilities to create your own or join a player/official tournament;> The dev team is actively involved in reacting upon community feedback and improving the base game;> Excellent price/quality ratio in my opinion.The game has various difficulty settings. I consider myself pretty good in reading the course and circumstances, but on serious difficulties my gameplay certainly needs a lot of practise. Which is ultimately rewarding in my opinion, because the realism is so high some practice really pays off. Having delivered a devastating start in the Q-school (onlinegolftour .net) I actually feel quite happy with myself after playing 6 increasingly better rounds.There are still things to improve (player career being one of them).

Not saying that makes my review more credible, but it may give a hint on what I look for and am annoyed with...There´s lots of graphical adjustments to suit most people which is good. You have your sound options and of course your golfer customization. You can pick your clubs and equipment and buy more if thas not enough for you. At the moment you don´t have that much to buy so perhaps thats something that will be added along the way. A bunch of golf courses are included and more are available to buy for a few bucks. I´m fine with that. The courses included are fine and varying in style.You have your practice mode which I think could be better if you had more putting and pitching options and such. Tourmaments are not used much as far as I can see which is a shame. Multiplayer will be your only option if you want to play with other players but my feeling is that this is not very active. You have to work a bit to get a game started. If you just want to play a few holes you´ll probably end up chosing solo-play anyway.I feel I can go on and on about this so I´ll just end with what I think works well and what doesn´t.Graphics are fine even though animations could be alot better.Sound effects are good but the game is really missing commentary. It feel lonely out there too often.Motionswing is frustration and annying - in other words perfect! That´s golf! :) No seriously I feel they´ve done a great job with that one. You need to practice and you won´t get it perfect all the time.Putting is hard which is also fine but I don´t like the fact that you almost all the time have to aim 5 meters to your left/right because the greens have such big slopes. That´s just not very realistic I´m afraid. There´s some work to be done here.As I´m a ""leftie"" I of course miss the left handed player...Would I recommend the game? Well...there aren´t too many good golf games out there today so I guess we can´t be too selective here. If you like to play a quick round now and then and aren´t that interested in career modes and the stuff EA:s Tiger Woods golf had to offer, this game should be enough for you. I wouldn´t pick it up for retail price though as I don´t think the game is finished yet. To me it´s still in ""early access""."

The devs genuinely take feedback on board and where applicable, use it to continually improve the game. An ever increasing library of user made courses (some of them excellent) helps to grow the community involved and the game itself.A multitude of available swing types and difficulty levels and customisations provide a great golf game to suit anyone from a casual 'fun' level experience right thru to as challenging as you want it.Im loving where this game is going and cant help but be excited about where it will go in the future. Exciting times for computer golf!"

Having played most every golf game out there it didn't take me long to come to the conclusion that this is a mediocre game at best. Graphics are fine. Scenery and Courses are...well, fine too. But game controls and ball physics are ancient. Way below par. Lacking info on club length, aiming is hard, to coarse. So you are gambling most of the time.Not sure if there are better golf games for mac, but this one I would steer away from if you are familiar with, say, the EA tiger woods franchise which is, even arcadish in nature, much better and smoother executed than this."

It does bring back the good ol days of pc golf games.  But that said, it is pretty limited.  You have one avatar and limited selection for modifying your player.  There is no season that I can find, and I usually only see one or two games for online play, which doesn't bother me i just play locally anyway, but if that's your thing be warned.  In the end, I enjoy playing single rounds of golf here, but I don't like the lack of depth and customization.  I do, however, like playing around with the course maker and may one day finish a course.  The developers have great tutorials on doing this, which gives me hope for more custom mods for clubs, shafts, grips, gloves, balls, etc...I am recommending,  for the reasons stateds, but realize what you're getting;  the thumbs down reviews are valid here as well."

It has been quite the ride but well worth it. I am so impressed at how game play has morphed to where it is today. The fine tuning of the UI and all of the features that reflect the touch elements of golf have been so well tweaked. The variety of options for altering game conditions including time of day, weather, green speed, etc., should be enough to satisfy most challenge levels.I have 150 hours on this game, played over a long period of time.

There are free courses of every description available and very many of them are fine renditions of courses both real and imagined, though the game arrives with a worthy selection to begin with.  You can set the time of day and the weather.  The graphics are great -- early morning sunlight is wonderful shining through the trees and creating realistic shadows.  You can set up computer players to challenge you or just play alone if you wish (I like a player to join me).  It seems to me that the swing accuracy is good, although I must admit that when your computer partner sinks putts and chips from all over the place it's a bit discouraging.I don;t know what you might demand of a golf sim, but for my money this is as good as they get, and then some!  So without reservation, I highly recommend this game to any and all who enjoy computer golf.  Get it."

Once the ability to select/create custom avatars is available (if ever), then I would tend to think that PG would attract even more fans. The player-created courses allow the game's features to be expanded upon, but again in my opinion it will be the customizations with characters, clubs, etc. that will truly allow the experience to be much more enjoyable to that of The Golf Club or many PGA titles. 8/10 rating and purchased directly on Steam in October, 2016"

76561198109536056,Recommended,288140,31662604,Posted: 10 May,all,uncle_adolph,"First, the good points. If you simply want to play a round of computer golf that looks and feels reasonably realistic and where you feel that the results are down to your own skill rather than pure luck then this will suit you. Using the motion swing control method it will take an awful lot of practice to hit the ball accurately particularly when it comes to putting. After more than 40 hours playing I am still to complete a round anything better than +5.....But unfortunately the game has a totally unfinished air to it. There is no career mode and, worse of all, no player stats within the game. I find it totally incomprehensible that in a game that stats were created for there is simply nothing. And that brings up the other big problem....no feedback and no support. Very, very disappointing.The game does come with a number of courses both real and fantasy which are generally very good. There is also a website where further courses can be downloaded. But that, in itself, brings another problem....the PP servers are currently down and when they are (which is rather frequently) then the downloaded courses don't show in the game and can't be played. Aaaargh!I would love to recommend this game but in all honesty, regrettably, I can't. Sorry!Review Mk 2:After more weeks of playing the game, and whilst I still bemoan the lack of a career mode or readily accessible stats, I have to slightly revise my review.Whilst I didn't mention it above one of the things I disliked about the game was the infamous ""lip out"" with putting and the devs have now greatly improved that. And whilst I'm still hopeless at the game (I still haven't done a round in anything better than +2) perhaps it does more reflect real ability than pure luck.So if you can accept the drawbacks I will give it cautious approval!"
