,Recommended,288160,32125027,Posted: 2 June,all,Bad Whippet,"What is it?The Room is the first in a series of three games (two of which have been released on PC, the third is still only on Android and iOS).  It is a 3D puzzle game where you must manipulate ornate wooden boxes, highly detailed mechanisms, locks and gears, light puzzles and secret panels to unlock the secrets of the 'null' element.  Each part of the puzzle you unlock unfolds another room with more of the puzzle to unlock.  The whole game is point and click, with fluid and responsive movements all controlled by mouse.Is it any good?It is exceptional, but then the store page reviews have probably already given you a clue to that.  The game conveys perfectly the textures you are manipulating which, along with the atmospheric audio, creates an incredibly tactile feel to every moving part.  The puzzles are taxing without being impossible, and each solved part provides a level of satisfaction that ensures you can't wait to unlock the next part!Who will enjoy this?Anyone who is familiar with the Myst series of games, Obduction or the incredible puzzles of the once-greatSafecrackerby Kheops Studios (not to be confused with other games of the same name) will definitely enjoy this one!  As far as difficulty goes, the pitch seems perfect (easier than some of the Myst games, but still sufficiently challenging).Anything not to like?There is a small glitch that affects anyone playing on monitors with anything greater than 60Hz refresh rates, where the marble in the final maze puzzle can get stuck, making the puzzle impossible to complete.  However, this can be remedied in one of two ways: either switch to the beta version of the game in your Steam library (because the developers released a fix for it in this version), or simply lock your referesh rate to 60Hz for that puzzle.  Personally, I play the beta version, but I've also tried locking my refresh rate and both solutions work just fine.The only other small disappointment is that the developers don't seem overly fond of porting their work to PC and so it is possible that the third game might never find its way to Steam at all (which is a shame because ALL the games are equally brilliant).In summary...The Room is an incredibly tactile and involving puzzle game that will appeal to anyone who'd appreciate unlocking a complex series of wooden boxes to access what is inside.  The intricate puzzles are both highly detailed and a lot of fun to solve, and are original and varied, making The Room an exceptional game.  A word of warning: this game will absolutely make all other puzzle-based games feel decidedly 'meh' when you see what can be achieved by the developers of this series!Highly recommended!"

The puzzles require some thought but they are not stupidly put together - rather they require some logical thinking to solve and, to me, this is what makes a puzzle game truly great. Throw in beautiful art and design that compliments the game. Really my only complaint is that the controls are not all that intuitive but I just considered them part of the puzzling adventure. I suspect that I'll end up replaying this again in a couple of years - it's one of those games, like Myst or a truly good book, that you can enjoy again in the future - like reconnecting with an old friend you haven't seen in years...."

I mean, I would have at least expected a football game at the very least. Instead, we get a short, but very well-made puzzle game. None of the puzzles are too hard, and the game can be finished in a matter of hours, but it's alright for what it is."
,Recommended,288160,18879391,"Posted: 4 November, 2015",all,JacquesLeSauve,"My initial impression of this was it struck me as slightly intimidating, like it was going to be a full on, hardcore puzzler that would probably require lots of knowledge of mathematics and note-taking, or just generally prove to showcase my ignorance as I'd have to hit Google a lot to find information for the answers, but I couldn't have been more wrong. It's much more about observation and curiosity and how savvy the player is at uncovering a secret hidden in plain sight.The game is divided into five chapters, each literally revolving around some kind of object, be it a safe or table or elaborately decorated box, and it's up to the player to investigate every part of it for hidden compartments and objects to further unlock ever more secrets inside. I loved how unassuming every object looked, only to then find huge sections of it popping open to reveal some intricate mechanism to interact with and figure out. There are some slightly more conventional style puzzles along the way, but like the larger objects that house them, they're really more about poking and prodding at something to find out how it works rather than being a test of knowledge. It really is incredibly accessible, even for those who conventionally wouldn't ever go anywhere near puzzle games.It's surprisingly atmospheric as well, giving a feeling that the more you strip away of the puzzles and the deeper you get into these contraptions, the more you're digging into something you probably shouldn't be and into a world much bigger than you. That also ties in with the story, told through notes tucked away by a slightly mad scientist as he searches for some mystical form of energy. This is also helped by occasionally switching views to a special eye glass which reveals a world hidden behind the shadows of everything you see around you. It's a really clever element that ties to both the puzzles and the story and gives something extra to what could have easily been a straightforward game about playing with a puzzle box.I'm trying to think of any downsides worth mentioning before you go into this, but I really can't think of any. There may not be a massive amount of replay value, since discovery is the main objective of the game, but even so I really look forward to going through it all again some day. It helps too that it's only about 2 or 3 hours long as well. Maybe it could have been a little bolder in challenging the player with some of the puzzles, but that's really a minor complaint to what was an otherwise fun and enjoyable experience, and maybe they'll up the ante a little if the second and third games in the series ever make their way to PC. I really hope they do release them here, and if they do then I'll be first in line to play them, but to those who haven't had the pleasure yet, I could easily recommend this to all without a moment's hesitation."

Boxes.I'm not sure what it is about locks, tiny keys, hidden compartments, pushy things, slidy things, twisty things, little odds and ends here and there carved in exquisite woods and inlaid with embossed metals that causes me to foam at the mouth in sheer ecstasy -- but this game captured the essence of mystery and romance of that whichisthe puzzle box, in its entirety.""The Room"" is one of the very few puzzle box games that I enjoyed every second of. There are no giant leaps in logic. The puzzles are wonderfully automatized. The euphoric feeling of hearing something click -- seeing something change -- is present and accounted for!Some might say the game is too easy, or that there is only one route, but this is the reality of the puzzle box. Most puzzle boxes in video games do not function like real, living, breathing puzzle boxes; however, this game comes as close as I've seen. I flowed through the chapters, following not only the logic of the puzzles, but the mechanical design of the box itself!

Renowned for his tenuos grasp of things like the english language, directing, producing, writing and acting, Tommy has now turned to videogames as the medium in which to ply his craft. His first foray into this is a painstaking look at the nature of puzzles and how they effect us in life. After being betrayed and torn apart by his girlfriend Lisa, and discovering he is the fool, Tommy constructs an elaborate puzzle box to house his will and testement that names Denny, his mentally challenged neighbor/adopted son, the sole heir to his monumental fortune from working in at the Bank before commiting suicide. You play as Johnnies lawyer, charged with unlocking the box before Lisa and her evil cohorts can kill Denny. Their plan is to assassinate him while he's playing football in a tuxedo, something he does every day, so the time table is very tight on this thriller. Unlock box after box and throw spoons at the screen as puzzles refuse to relent.

The Room is the best puzzle game I have ever played and I've been playing them since the 1990s. It's puzzling in its most basic form. There is no real story, you just tackle one big puzzle, although it's divided into five chapters. It's hard to describe in a few words why this game is so good, but simply put: it's fun! And playing The Room feels exciting and rewarding. They just got ""it"" right - ""it"" being everything a game like this should be, while being a completely unique experience unlike any other puzzle game I know of.Maybe just a few short additional notes, though, that may help you decide whether to buy The Room if you're still not sure:- it's a short game: it takes only about 3 hours if you take your time, so you may want to pick it up when it's on sale- it's a rather easy game: for me the game was just challenging enough but if you're the sadistic kind of puzzler who only likes being challenged to the point of migraine, you will not find that here. On the contrary, there is a hint system in the game so if you feel stumped at any time, you can click a button to give you some pointers.- the Steam Achievements are the most basic: one achievement for completing each chapter of the game.I would recommend this game to everyone, not just to people who like playing puzzle games. It's really that good. But since it's a pretty short game, you may want to wait until it's on sale to buy it."

Snatched this up on the Summer Sale on a lark, because cheap.Should have waited until the fourth.Guys, a 75% discount was way too steep if you ask me. Now I'm down for a good brain breaker, but you've gone and set the high bar for this sort of game. The puzzles are widely varied, some difficult almost to a fault, and you somehow managed to keep it from degenerating into ""rub inventiry thing on other inventory thing and use that to molest everything until something works"" motif that are all too common in games like this.Tiny, clean environments set the scene without being distracting. Russian nesting doll-style puzzles that are admittedly scientific and mechanical manure, whilst somehow making sense in context. You have one static inventory item that you'll use in all five chapters-- and you'll spend the first bit and a half getting that rebuilt.Kind of hard to do spoilers as well. The story is barebones, mostly told through diary entries and the odd letter. You can skip all but the original letter, and you still have a game. If you read all the text-y bits, you get a picture of a man going off the deep end, and not in a good way.Might could have done without the creepy music. It's good music, and it works for atmosphere, but it can be a quick distraction for folks with the attention span of a deranged squirrel on top-grade methamphetamine.That said, I managed to stay in my chair, completely absorbed, for the three hours it took me to finish it. It's a rare game that manages that, and kudos for it.I'll get a video up for it as soon as I can figure out how without giving away any of the puzzle solutions.All of that in a mobile port...

You are in the haunted attic of a mansion and you find an elaborate and ornate box. By flipping levers and dials, pressing buttons, putting keys in locks, and generally fiddling you slowly open more and more of the box and learn about the secret of the room. The plot is mostly flavour and mood rather than a concrete narrative. Puzzles are fun and generally fair. The game looks gorgeous. At 2-3 hours, I think the game is priced appropriately.I want to emphasize two things for people considering the game:First, the built-in hint system is excellent. Automatically after fiddling around for a while, if you're not making progress, the game will help you by giving you a hint prompt. Click on it and you'll progressively get more information. In this way you never feel stuck or under pressure. If you're getting frustrated, take a hint. If not, that's okay too.Second, while the visuals on the PC version are excellent, the controls remain optimized for touch platforms. The game is very tactile, lots of dragging and rotating and moving things. Although this is replicated here via mouse controls, I think it's probably a little more playable on a tablet for that reason. I beat the game on iPad a few years ago and replayed here. I believe the game is generally cheaper on tablets as well. So if you're a big Steam collector, prefer playing everything on PC, or just want to support the devs, by all means buy this, but if you're considering both the tablet version and this version. I'd go iPad first.Looking forward to the third installment being released on Steam."

It really gets everything right: graphics, story, sound, atmosphere and ambiance, controls...everything is pretty perfect. My wife, who had played the original version kept saying how much better this port looked, sounded, and controlled over the original (due to the HD upgrades I guess), although I don't personally have a means to compare personally. What I can tell you is that it was an amazing experience. It's a very challenging game at times, but it never overwhelms and never feels cheap. Basically, you are following clues left by The Rooms creator, who was researching a basically unknown alchemical element (you know: earth, wind, fire, water...those are the four, and contrary to what the movie said, the Fifth Element isn't love, lol (at least, not in this game). It has a sort of creepy vibe to it, but it isn't actually scary at all. It's really more mysterious than anything else. I had no idea what was going to happen next. The ending clearly paved the way to part 2, which I haven't played yet (although I can see why people are chomping at the bit waiting for it to be ported to PC as well). ). I actually thought the ending was kind of comical, not because it's actually funny, but more because of how much effort you put into getting there....and while I know this probably doesn't make much sense reading it, it will totally make sense once you actually experience the ending. Still, it was a great ending that was also an obvious lead in to Part Two.I highly recommend this game, and although it's only getting 70's on average on metacritic, I easily give this game 10 out of 10.

If it had been longer, or if there I'd owned any potential sequels, I would not be writing this now. I'd have continued playing sans hesitation. Yet, questions remain.But there really isn't much to say without compromising the enjoyment of this puzzle game for new players, so I won't try. Simply that the ""craftsmanship"" of the items was superb, and the ""supernatural"" storyline eliminated any physics issues to arise in players' minds. The controls were about as simple as one would ever hope to encounter, and more or less intuitive. I only hope the developers had as much fun making this game as I had in playing it.It didn't take long to realize that EVERYTHING of value toward solving each and every puzzle was immediately available. It was rarely even necessary to look further than a foot or so away, even though that slippery slope might easily have been provided more layered challenges. I dare say without spoiling too much, just about the ONLY outside information needed was a knowledge of the primary colors. Yes, about 3rd grade knowledge. Even a reference to a verse from something as universally accessible as the Christian Bible served a completely different, albeit more interesting and deceptively simple purpose.Oddly contrary to expectations, the last part of this game became EASIER. The last section was by FAR the simplist, completed in minutes, very nearly without thought or imagination at all. Just by completing simple steps, as though the basic idea had run out of ""steam"", so to speak. Or perhaps, simply as restful reward for diligent players. Yet there were so many ideas unused. The notes might have been better utilized, much as the drawings began to be (though somewhat nonspecifically.) The surrounding environs perhaps put to some use, if only the walls and ceilings (which were by NO means ignored visually.) Perhaps various lenses. Not to say that anything more was needed in the existing game, but it could have been longer or more complex. Or, dare I say, to make the last section more challenging. In fact, I would not hesitate to say that the last section could have rather been one of the very first, to warm up the player instead of to try to scare some away, as seems to have been done with some of the stronger early challenges. Stronger, but NOT engineering student CRAZY hard. A reasonably curious mind with a minor bent toward lateral thinking is fully adequate. A sense of humor helps greatly. I enjoyed this game VERY much, and only wish I could continue, unabated, indefinately.The HELP mode. Yes...and No. Admittedly, I used numerous hints, and they added to the enjoyment, though were far from perfect. (Forgive me if I sound as if I criticize my very lifesaver. They certainly added immensely for one not willing to commit to a single game for an extended time, regardless of the high quality of enjoyment.) They often gave hints that were past being of use. Perhaps that was to make a player feel smarter, but for me they often did the opposite by dumbing me down, though sometimes most amusingly.Perhaps readers of this review can offer an assist. One hint told me I had missed something in the VERY beginning that was needed. Since there is only one SAVE, and that automatic, the only option to explore that hint was to restart the entire game. But despite that drastic step, the ""item"" was NOT available (confirmed by player generated video), nor was it mentioned again! Any thoughts, readers?My only remaining question is if I will research a sequel BEFORE or AFTER I post this review....As with many Steam games, offline gametime is ignored.(l&h/bSw!HC)"
,Recommended,288160,33459385,Posted: 11 July,all,dotHacker,"Originally developed for iOS back in 2012, The Room was a surprise hit to its developers and for good reason. Although being insanely compact in content and developed by just a crew of two people, it scratches a specific ""tinkering"" itch other puzzle games haven't. Add to that its eerie but calm soundtrack, crisp HD visuals, and hints of mystery to solve, it's got all the elements of an enjoyable hour or two.Pros- Sharp and high-resolution graphics. Supports low end devices, too.- Ambient music that fits the mood and is never intrusive.- A hint system that you can disable at your own pace- Creative use of touchscreen inputs for a ""hands on"" feel- A mixture of puzzles, not just mechanical, but visual too.Cons- Short. 1-3 hours tops.- Low replayability, since the puzzles and solutions are all the same.- The touchscreen controls are part of the charm, but I feel it could have been revisited for use with a mouse; opening lids in particular required swipes, which is not very intuitive with a mouse.The Room is essentially a safe-cracking puzzle game, with you pursuing the articles left behind by a vanished researcher in pursuit of the enigmatic element ""null."" The entire game is a series of contraptions in the center of a table, while you rotate the entire circumference looking for things to fiddle with. It's difficult to say much more about The Room without spoiling some of the fun; If you like working with your hands, you will love the intuitive control scheme and a-ha! moments it brings.The Room is part of a trilogy and as of this review the 3rd has not been announced for steam. I look forward to playing the sequel next-- are you reading, devs? :)Due to its length, I high recommend purchasing it on sale. Took me about 2 hours with interruptions.Achievement hunters: This is an easy 100% (simply complete the game)"

However, being hard isn't at all defining how awesome the game is. It's a 'box' puzzle game where you have a certain object before you - some sort of a box/contraption - that you have to unlock by learning about it and revealing its nature by exploring it, which in turn allows you to unlock parts of it and so on until you solve it. There's also a short story as background context if you're interested.All in all this is a great game that rewards curiosity and imagination. The graphics (lighting, geometry) and sound (ambience and mechanical sounds) are superb and in a way satisfying. The only downside for some is that the game is short but, honestly, I personally enjoyed every bit of it and think that 'more of the same' would weaken the experience.

In the attic of a disappeared friend, you find a safe with a note inviting you to solve its mystery and unlock the content, retracing the steps of your friend as he explored powers unknown.Pros: You gradually solve the locks one by one, every chapter facing a different mechanized contraption starting with opening the safe, to opening the box within, to unlocking a cartography table, all while reading clip notes about the unconventional research your friend was doing. Each step is a new challenge that will rarely ever be solved with a similar solution from one to another. Every time you solve such as step, your focus in brought to a specific change such as a trap door opening or a riddle pointing you to a secret button, but you'll often need to re-explore and re-examine the entire device to find what else changed, often twice considering you'll early on get your hands on a special lens that allows you to see secret clues beyond the surface of puzzles. Although it was ported from a mobile game, the re-done PC version offers impeccable graphics with extremely high resolution textures (even at high closeups) and lighting effect that really immerse you into the game.Cons: Camera control is locked, so you're only able to see from certain specific angles, zoom on certain specific points, which is sad considering the level of detail put into the 3D models. Although this game will pick your brain as you're trying to figure each step, you eventually figure them out fairly easily: with little to no experience (which is my case) in puzzle box games, you can get through it without ever using the help function. The game is pretty short, you can complete it in 2 to 3 hours, and there is absolutely no replay value as the puzzle will never change. The game tries to drag you into its story, but there is extremely little of it, not enough to make you actually care, considering you can skip most clip notes as they rarely say anything that pertains to the puzzle.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youThis is an excellent-looking puzzle game, but it's held back by lack of challenge, resulting in a very short experience. Don't get me wrong: it gets my recommendation, but I sure hopeThe Room Twohas a larger quantity of riddles and puzzles lined up or I will be fairly disappointed.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)reviews."

A good book of course is always a good option but I cannot think of many better ways to spend 99p than on The Room. It's a warm fart in a cold bed, a tender kiss from a loved one, it's a lollipop after a visit to the dentist, or an absorbing story from a good friend which makes you forget yourself. There are no guns, or jumping, or timed button presses, just you, in a room, with a safe and a fascinating premise which encourages you to think, and to open it.

The 3D is really good - it must be a blast in VR. All the inputs are done with the mouse, imitating real life movements. (Much like in Penumbra: Ouverture, which is a freaking amazing game) The 3D and the mouse manipulation makes you really feel like you're manipulating your environment, turning around the box, pushing this and pulling that. It's baffling! All that wicked machinery makes you dizzy just imagining the concept phase of the game.What I liked the most is the sens of freedom in the gameplay, with no hand holding; yet if you're stuck you can ask for a hint. My playthrough lasted 4 hours and a half, which is a steal for the price I paid for it during the Steam sales - 1€24!). I did have a tiny bug in the puzzle before the very last one, the cube wouldn't finalize and I had to quit to the main menu and reload my game to reinitialize it and redo it. But apart from that hiccup the game was bug free.Totally recommend it! I'm not much into puzzle games - have very few patience for them - but this one hooked me right from the beginning, it's in the upper quality category.

Unlike other puzzle games, you're never doing ""levels"" in this one; your current box always teases you with several obvious locks to open, but it depends on you, your skills of logic and observation, to figure out which one and how. It is a very quiet, patient occupation: you're turning the box this way and that, examine it here and there, until something clicks (sometimes literally) and you are one step further to the solution.The puzzles are, for the most part, novel; Steam says I played 3 hours, but it sure feels longer, and it was worth every second. I had turned hints off in the options, which means you still get some basic feedback when you're attempting the impossible; with hints on, you get a question mark icon you can click on when you're stuck.Of course a game such as this has little replayability unless you have forgotten how everything works and where the hidden bits are -- you can just rejoice in the beauty of it (it is a mobile port, but it sure doesn't feel like one, it looks positively amazing on 24""), and wait for ""The Room 2"" (and 3) to come to the PC.

Not sure if you personaly are fond of thinking about where to stick it, but get ready to think about it a lot.

This is a game you'll want to replay with friends, just so they can see and experience the complexity of the beautiful puzzles.This game comes in stages, each level with a steady difficulty curve from the previous one; none of these puzzles are overly challenging, but several of them are delightfully innovative. Clicks and sweeps of the mouse are how you navigate around each level, each level focused around a multi-faceted, multi-layered object of incredible texture and brilliance. The objects you handle are just as delicious visually as the puzzles are stimulating. All of the clicks and camera motions are smooth, andI encountered no glitches while playing this game. For players having trouble figuring out the 'where' of something, whether it be a hidden tool or what the tool should be used on, there are useful hints that come in stages, and only when prompted. The first hint is always very vague, usually enough to trigger that 'oh!, I remember that!'. The second hint is always blunt, and gets you past whatever your snag is without fail. For players who despise hints, they can also be disabled entirely, so they won't distract you with their gentle pulsing light in a tiny corner of the screen.I loved everything about this game, from the haunting and mysterious sounds, to how theplotis delivered in carefully placed puzzles, scenery, and letters. Above all, the texturing and the details of the puzzles themselves. Every object is beautiful and can be examined up close, whether they go into your inventory, or they are part of the larger puzzle. This is the kind of game that inspires writing and dreams. I recommend it to all of my friends, and have replayed it myself. This is not a puzzle game you will be frustrated with, or regret; it strikes an incredible balance for all levels and variety of players."

,Recommended,288160,24103760,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,retroid,"The Room is a point and click examina-thon game that generally is targeting a very specific audience (people who enjoy stuff like MYST will probably like this) and although its demographic is niche, the game for me personally hits all the right spots to make it a very enjoyable and ""comfy"" game, despite not being a huge fan of these types of games.The Room is exactly what it says on the tin I guess in terms of premise; you are in a room, and in this dark room you have in front of you on a table a puzzle of some kind, with the setting of the game being in the 1800s, I think anyway. These puzzles are generally very bizarre and extremely intricate, with little details and inklings on each set piece to allow you to examine or play with. The objective is relatively simple; open up each puzzle, and as each puzzle opens, another awaits inside. Picture those russian dolls that have little versions of each other inside them. There is some kind of hidden story involved in the game, but for me personally it was best to not know much for the sheer feeling of mystery involved.The graphics are very photorealistic, volumetric, and pristine, which obviously allows for more obscure puzzles to be made that couldnt have been achieved on engines for games like MYST back in the 90s. The game's soundtrack consists of eery ambient music, sometimes with the rhythm of a heartbeat, probably indicating that your character is either panicking or focusing on solving each dimensional puzzle in the game. Clicking on things, usually ones with twisty handles or rotational movements, can be a little awkward and fidgety to work with, but besides that, the game controls pretty seamlessly.The game unfortunately has the issue of being incredibly short, being around 2-3 hours probably depending on how gud you are at solving these kind of puzzles, but for me the money price was worth a pound or two, just for the sheer level of detail in each of the 5 puzzles.If there is one issue with the Room that I will point out, it is the sheer unawareness of how comfy the game could actually be without its creepy atmosphere, but I suppose it would be considered some kind of clone to other point and click examination games, so the horror setting I suppose helps it be unique.Overall, an enjoyable experience that was comfy to play while it was raining outside, filled with atmosphere and that Victorian-era feel to it."

I've always been a fan of games with puzzles and such, so this one was pretty exciting for me. First time through it, a fair amount of puzzles had me stumbled for awhile, some for a rather long time. Overall, I did find it challenging. Wasn't too easy, but wasn't impossibly hard either. Second time through the game months later on here, while I did get through it quicker, some puzzles still had me stumped for awhile. Some puzzles actually require you to think and such, while others make the solution not so obvious. I also noticed the improvement in things like graphics and such, which I thought was a nice improvement, though not surprising as a mobile gaming being brought to PC, it would make sense. Take advantage of bigger screen and such. All in all, while a bit of a shorter game, with the puzzles, difficulty, etc, it makes it worth the purchase and it's a game I thoroughly enjoyed."

Your character enters a room with a mysteriouz puzzle box and on it a note from a friend. You read the note then you are on your way to puzzle solving galore.The puzzles in this game have an extremely wide variety. While some of the puzzles can be fairly difficult, there are hints that, while they are helpful, do not directly give you the answers you are looking for. These can be disable for veteran puzzle solvers of course. You could easily get stuck on a puzzle without the hints, but with them you will likely not spend more than 10 minutes on any given puzzle. Your progression will be saved after each puzzle you complete, as opposed to after each chapter. This is excellent because it makes diving in to solve the next piece of the puzzle that much more conveniant.You will be doing everything from searching for keys to hunting for clues on which square to turn which direction.The room is unique in that the entire game takes place at the box and by hunting, you are just searching in, on and around the box for said keys and clues. Each time you unlock one puzzle you can expect there to be another one come out of it, each one bringing you closer to the mystery inside the box.One of the best features in The Room is the sound effects. Everytime you hear the turning of a key, the snap of a puzzle piece you just insterted or the ever so satisfying click of a new part of the box being revealed you will feel truly immersed in the experience. These little noises are the song of progression.You can expect to complete The Room in around 3 hours depending on your skill at puzzle solving. I did encounter one bug near the end of the game but thankfully there was a solution on the Steam forums already so I was able to move quickly past it. The game was extremely satisfying and I am glad to have experienced it. If you enjoy puzzles, this is a must play."

You had to figure out the right rotation of parts so that the key would fit in the lock.

,Recommended,288160,13153601,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,castorquinn,"In BriefThe Roomis literally a puzzle box, a fantastic mechanical device that you open by solving the puzzles built into its surfaces.Most valuable resource:The incredible mystery of this absolutely incredible box.Of interest to:pure puzzlers.Often puzzle games will wrap their puzzles around some artifice, some premise that explains why you are solving puzzles.  A whole sub-genre of video game logic deals with how preposterous and improbable it is that, for instance, an ancient civilisation designed its temple such that only by rolling sixteen balls into position and solving a maths equation could they enter.  The puzzles might be solid and entertaining and challenging, but the premise requires a hefty suspension of disbelief.Never in my life have I played a game whose puzzles are so cohesive, so plausible, so absolutely real as they are in the Room.  Fantastic, sure; impossible, absolutely, but impossible in a completely consistent, believable way that draws you into the magic of this puzzle box.  Couple this with some of the most gorgeously detailed visuals I have seen in a game and you have without question the most immersive, engaging puzzler.  Rather than a series of brain teasers connected weakly by narrative, literally the entire game is just you peeling back layer after layer of this mysterious, mystical box, very occasionally reading a cryptic note by your predecessor that answers nothing but raises more questions and drags you further into the labyrinthine structure that seems to get bigger the more you delve into it.I cannot help but say this: the science-mysticism, the mood, the puzzles, the box itself - I couldn't stop thinking this is what Hellraiser would have been like if it were made by Rand and Robyn Miller.A word about the puzzles: despite the impossibility of these mechanisms all fitting within the box, the puzzles all feel solidly mechanical, they all make perfect sense as a set of puzzles you could actually use as a sophisticated locking mechanism for a box.  Many of the puzzles involve you poking at nooks and crannies to find hidden buttons or activators or concealed drawers containing cogs or codes, and the puzzles on a layer often feed into each other, one puzzle releasing the mechanism of another.  You are given almost no clues (unless you use the hint system, which, honestly, don't - this is one game where perseverance is its own reward, and I say this as an habitual user of walkthroughs), so it really feels like you are exploring and fiddling with this incredible device, moving around it, examining its finely-crafted detail, touching it and testing for a reaction.  It feels very real.  Even in the later stages when the mystical elements start to take over - a perfectly natural evolution of the box as you delve deeper - it still feels so scientific and so physical.On the puzzles themselves: they are not very challenging, for the most part.  Figuring out what you need to do is harder than figuring out how to do it.  There are just enough hidden activators that you can overlook that it drives home that realism and that mechanical feel, but not so many that it turns into a frustrating hidden object game.  If you know roughly what you are trying to do - for instance, activate all the levers on one side of the box - you can generally work backwards to figure out which panel you should solve first to unlock that final side, and this process of deduction and experimentation is really the core of the puzzle gameplay.  Codes don't need to be deduced, they just need to be found, but recognising that what you've found is in fact a code is the challenge.  It makes for a very deductive, exploratory experience, rather than intellectual brute force trying to calculate permutations as is common in many pure puzzlers.There is one single puzzle towards the end of the game that I think is poorly designed.  Without spoiling it, at one point in the penultimate stage you need to interact with a music box in a way that makes no sense, cannot be predicted, cannot really be witnessed or tested, and, even after reading a walkthrough for this one roadblock, I still didn't understand the puzzle.  When you get to this bit, if you can solve it, kudos to you; I couldn't, and not because it was hard but because it was so utterly random in a game that otherwise makes perfect sense from start to finish.This single puzzle aside, the game runs for a couple of hours, and those hours are absolutely gorgeous and engrossing.  I want to say again how stunning the detailed art for the box actually is.  I, and especially my partner with whom I played this, have a love of antique furniture, and this game won us over from the very first sight of the box.  I cannot oversell this box: mechanisms aside, if you had a piece that simply had the visual detail of any layer of this thing you would treasure it as art.  With less attention to detail, the game would still be good, but because of the incredible work they did on the appearance and fidelity of the box itself, and the way the puzzles felt so mechanical and so cohesive, the whole process of solving this game felt real in a way that puzzle games never do.If you like puzzle games, play The Room.  It does not get any better than this."

None are particularly difficult; focused more on looking around the subject (an intricate box, basically).I only completed the first two chapters, due to the whole game up to that point being centered around the same subject matter. There was no real story and while the puzzles were quite fun, there were far too many little fiddly 'puzzles' in each sector of each chapter for it to hold my attention. I didn't know where the game was going or what the point of it all is.If there were 3 chapters, or if each chapter didn't have quite as many puzzles in, I feel the game would still hold the same value but have presented itself more efficiently. At the end of the day it's only going to take a couple of hours to work through anyway, what does it matter if it loses 20 minutes of the more pointless puzzles.However I recommend this game because the general quality is high, the puzzles on the whole are interesting but not too challenging and some of the mechanisms are very intricate.

Albeit, it's a little on the short side, however it's both extremely intriguing and fascinating in unique ways. The 'story' revealed to you along the way of your puzzle solving is mysterious and leaves you asking questions about reality itself. Ingenius design and mechanics. The puzzles themselves weren't overly difficult and the in game 'hint' option doesn't give too much away. One negative drawback of this game however, is the camera rotating and centering/zooming your view into a particular piece of the puzzle. It's very annoying at times and can sometimes hinder your progress. I was stuck on a certain section for 10 minutes, I knew the answer to solve it, however I wasn't ""zoomed in"" enough to interact with the puzzle and there was no indication of that.Loved every moment of this game and I will certainly be purchasing the sequel!"

Similar to the way Nicolas Cage opened up the Resolute Desks in National Treasure 2, but way more intricate.  It's unlike any 3D puzzle game I've played and it is a must have if you enjoy puzzle solving.On a side note, I did experience one bug with this sliding gem on a circular sectioned platform where it got stuck on a little nipple/spike thing towards the end of the puzzle.

Everything that looks mysterious is meaningless except for what little it contributes to the trite narrative.At no point is the player expected to imply lateral thinking, infer the rules of a system or really do anything interesting or challenging at all.

If you want a game unlike anything else you've played and like the idea of clearing out some of those cobwebs in your head, this is totally worth it.  Just for the atmosphere alone.

Something they said could never be built. It is the only one in existence, and it is the key to incomprehensible power."" The note you read sits on top of a large, ornate safe, along with a smaller box that contains an eyepiece without which the note claims you will be ""as blind as the rest"". It warns you that the stakes are high and that the safe was constructed to keep this incomprehensible power away from lesser minds. There's only one thing left for you to do: put on the eyepiece and open the box.Except this safe isn't easy to crack. There are dials to spin and knobs to turn and pieces missing. The whole thing is designed with puzzles in mind, providing you with a pleasantly interactive challenge to surpass in order to unlock the safe's mysterious contents. The eyepiece allows you to see once hidden drawings and symbols, which often provide important clues on how to solve certain puzzles. There are hidden compartments and switches to flip (or not to flip) and buttons disguised as decorations. And once you open up the safe? Well, let's just say there's more than one box to open.The puzzles in the Room are well-balanced and exciting, with each one being easy enough to solve that it doesn't frustrate you. Puzzles are often interconnected, with the completion of one puzzle unlocking an item that makes the solution to another puzzle accessible. As the game progresses, the puzzles become more involved and intricate. The design of each box is intriguing and, as the environment around you changes with the game's progression, the experience slowly becomes something far more surreal and fantastic than the dusty attic you start in.Overall, the Room is a short game that will pique your interest and encourage your curiosity. It isn't a game that will force an extreme intellectual challenge on you, but it will require some logical thinking and a few of the puzzles will make you scratch your head for a minute or two. The plot is vague enough to entice you without becoming hard to understand. The Room's shining glory is, without a doubt, its slow escalation from the ordinary to the extraordinary and its wonderfully beautiful atmosphere and handsome puzzle design. Very enjoyable and definitely worth a thumbs up!"

What a blast!The Room is a simple first person puzzle game where you progress through a series of intricate mechanical puzzle boxes.There is a creepy element to it, but it's not scary, rather it provides a thrilling feeling that makes you excited about progressing and seeign what comes next.The visuals are great; crisp and detailed 3D models with beautiful patterns and overall visual aesthetic that flows well throughout the whole game.The puzzles are not too difficult, but also not somethign you can breeze through in the first playthrough. The game does provide hitns in case you get stuck, but they're quite vague and not really much help.The only downside I can think of is that the controls feel somewhat lose and not very accurate at times, which was somewhat annoying when trying to position puzzle pieces into place.Overall though, I'd definetly recommend this game, especially to those that enjoy puzzle games, it is an amazing experience!"

Each of the five stages is its own contraption and you must reveal its secrets! The real thing that sets it apart is that it feels natural. It feels like someone could have made these things and you get to prod and fumble to figure them out. While the conundrums the game poses are challenging, they are fair and not obtuse.Graphically, it is soothing to the eyes. Again, it looks like these devices could have been made and that is largely because of the well done textures in this title.The worst thing I can say is it is short. I conquered the game in 2.5 hours. That might just be because I am pretty damn good at puzzles. I only paid 2.5 US dollars though, so I feel pretty good.

The story is a little lacklustre, but that isn't what is important here.  The difficulty increases in expert fashion, it never seems cheap and the puzzles are presented in a logical way.  As you begin to unlock the secrets of your box, you can find yourself completing the game in one sitting.  That is perhaps the only problem with the game; the lack of content.  It is a very short game, with a completion time of 2-3 hours.  Obviously once you have completed it once, you will be able to fly through it a second time.  This means that the first playthrough must be savoured and should not be ruined by using any sort of walkthrough.The Room gets most things right: graphics, difficulty, atmosphere and progression.  When it is on sale, it is well worth a purchase.  I found this puzzle box game to be highly enjoyable and worth the sale price.  It is surprisingly creepy for a game where you are just trying to unlock secrets in a box.  Ports of mobile games can be horrendous and a waste of time and money.

Although this game is not bad, it is not so good as the steam rating says either.

In my opinion the difficulty is very well tuned: It is easy enough that it remains accessible to many people, but it still requires enough mental effort for the puzzles to be satisfying to solve.I was particularly impressed with the sound department; the satisfying clicking, grinding and rattling sounds that the structures in the game make are very convincing and together with the lovely music manage to sell the game very well indeed.Although the importance of graphics in a game like this is not to be overstated, The Room features someexcellentvisuals. Not only is it a feast for the eyes to play through, but it makes the search for small notches and buttons within the puzzle much easier. Graphics are crystal clear, the lighting is moody and appropriate, and I could detect barely any aliasing while playing: Very nice.The story manages to loosely tie the puzzles together, but becomes at no point more engaging than the puzzles themselves, something I was quite happy about. Completing the game took me about 2 hours, which I thought was a very reasonable. I couldn't help hoping there would be more puzzles after the credits came rolling in, but for 5 euros I definitely got my money's worth.

But we felt that we got our money's worth of entertainment, because the game had just the right level of difficulty.If you like puzzle games that have a lot of lenses, gears, wheels and objects that you can spin around, this game is worth your attention.

There's a series of four or five consecutive puzzles that revolve around cracking into a peculiar box, and hints at a dark mystery behind it all.The hint system is nice, in that it offers a less direct alternative to just looking up the next step on a walkthrough. I avoided hints and spoilers as much as possible, but in the few instances I did use them, I could see that hints start vague, and hone in on the specific issue as the player repeatedly fails to interact with the right parts of the puzzle.The game is challenging without being unfair, the graphics are good, and there's a dash of narrative hinting at a dark backstory. Honestly, if this game were the same calibur but much longer, I would be shouting its name from the rooftops. Rest assured that, at the very least, while it might have a short playtime, the time spent playing will be a very solid puzzle experience."

There is no replay value once you complete the game.Full disclosure:I recommended this game, because it feels like a good puzzle game for those who are interested in puzzle games. However, it isn't a puzzle game where you will be racking your head for answers or answering trival knowledge questions. Everything you need, is right infront of you.Story:Prepare for some reading! This story line has heavy asian influences with the whole five elements and yin yan balance idea. A ton of pagan lore and demonic rituals thrown into the mix and you have a sort of mildly interesting plot. It isn't going to hold your attention for that long.Gameplay:The mechanics are simple. Your mouse controls your perspective and there is a lens that changes what you are see on screen. From there, it is trying to figure out the puzzles. I have a few complaints, namely very tedious tasks: turning keys, pulling out shelves, and other things.The puzzles themselves are fairly straight forward. Hints to solving them:1. Look at everything closely. Something silly will stand out and you will need to click on it.2. Remember or write down numbers or patterns. They will not change on different play throughs.3. On a perspective puzzle, find the right angle then start moving things around. Eventually things will work out.So, these tips should get you straight through the game.Get this game if you want an entry into the puzzle game genre. Avoid this game if you want a challenging puzzle game or you don't like puzzle games.God Bless, and thank you for this interesting game."

The game was originally released for tablet, but was ported to the PC with superior graphics.  The Room has players work through a hundred or so thought-provoking puzzles surrounding a series of puzzle-boxes, vaguely reminiscent of the Hellraiser movie series. The game is not of the horror genre, but does produce a slightly unnerving and eerie atmosphere.Unlike most puzzle games, The Room has very few, if any, puzzles that are unintuitive.  Progression is based almost entirely on one's attention to detail.  A full play-through will bring about 5 hours of entertainment.  Full-price on steam at $5, it is worth purchase for puzzle-fans, and definitely worth it for under $2.50 on steam sale.

The music is also fantastic... overall Fireproof has created a beautiful, immerisive game.It's quite short, but for $4.99 you get more than what you pay for.My only criticism is, it could have been slightly more optimized for PC.  Scroll wheel support, for example.  On mobile, I understood double tapping the screen to zoom.  On PC, it feels more natural to use the scroll wheel....

Originally for the iPad, the visuals have been enhanced for the PC version (and they were already gorgeous).It's delightful to look at, with each puzzle ""box"" intricately detailed, which is good because you spend the entirety of the game exploring them.  Interactions with the puzzles have a pleasingly tactile feel, requiring you to twist keys and pull handles.  That's probably a holdeover from its touchscreen origins, but it doesn't feel out of place.Some of the puzzles are brain teasers and some are simple exploration.  A few are obviously simple enough to be merely brute-forced, though those are the exception.  There's a plot, but it's mere window dressing.  In some games you Shoot The Mans and a little plot happens sometimes; here you Solve The Puzzles and a little plot happens sometimes.If you're a veteran of puzzle games then you might make short work of The Room; I spent around 3 hours start to finish, but I got it on sale for $2.50 so it's hard to fault it for value."

The puzzles are both unique and put intriguing twists on otherwise common puzzles, with various degrees of difficult. There is also a wonderfully mysterious storyline and intense atmosphere that matches with the steampunk and occult themes that make this game come to life. Not a very long game, I finished it in about 2 and half hours, however it was a couple hours well spent, I enjoyed the story, the way the story was told in pieces allowing the player to fill in the missing parts, the puzzles, the atmosphere of suspense and intrigue."

The puzzles are more a test of your observational skills rather than tricky logic, and if you find yourself stuck you probably need to check another side of the box for an answer.Highly enjoyable and definitely worth a go for the price."

Now to the fun part- complaining.I like when a game make you actually feel something, and you're most definitely left with a feeling of 'wtf I just played?' after last mystery is solved and you are presentedd with a short cinematic outro. Does it have a plot?Yes, it does. Although it sometimes feels like someone just said 'We cannot make a game solely consisting of solving puzzles, take your Macbook, go to a Starbucks and come up with something.' forgetting to mention that this person had only 4 hours, but spend half of the time scrolling through tumblr instead.It's not like smashing paranormal and supernatural ideas will always work, no matter the actual gameplay, but the idea is fresh (or not exploited enough) that you don't feel like the developer had an obstacle course -the kind of when you have a party hat on your head and there's a llama at the finish line- between cliches to put a plot together.What would be actually surprising if it were disappointing, considering that the game takes 2 hours to finish tops, but it's stilll worth it."

Besides, there are two more games for the story to possibly sort of go anywhere, hopefully."
,Recommended,288160,33204878,Posted: 3 July,all,Lincoln Balloon,"A puzzle game filled with objects so intricate they would make Lara Croft jealous.The Room isn't a long game.  It can be completed in just a couple of hours or so.  But if you're a fan of puzzle games, it's a fun time.  The constrained nature of the game prevents it from being too frustrating.  You're confined to looking at one particular object at a time, such as a safe or box.  But the detail on each object is stunning, and the mind-bending nature of some of the puzzles makes for a fun time.And hey, if you get stuck there is a hint system, although I feel like it pops up too fast.  It basically gives you about thirty seconds before it's like ""hey, you stuck?""  And when that question mark appears in the upper-left corner you're usually just like ""chill bro, just give me a minute...I got this"".  The clues themselves aren't too obvious either...more like subtle hints directing you where to look (they might get more blunt if you're really stuck...I didn't use them outside of a couple times).But don't play this game for the story.  While there is a context for everything, it's very sparse and not too fleshed out.  And the ending of the game is fairly unsatisfying.  It's basically a message that says ""good job"" and tells you to prepare for more to come.Overall, it's a budget remaster of a mobile puzzle game.  And for what it is, it's a fun little time."

,Recommended,288160,28803974,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Wootson,"This is the start of a supernatural themed puzzle journey. It reminds a little of the magical box from Clive Barker's Hellraiser series. Only with the gory elements removed, yet keeping the mysterious atmosphere intact. The puzzles revolve around a series of scientific experiments which have gotten (a little...) out of hand. Your interdimensional travels will start with a small box and some added writings. But rather soon you will be on your way into the deepest depths of this puzzle universe. There are enough riddles to be solved to keep you busy for anywhere between three to five hours. And for the low entrance fee during Steam sale events, this is pretty acceptable. It is not the best and/or most challenging puzzle game in the universe, but it sure is entertaining and features some very pleasing visuals.Minor quibbles: the ambient music is a little on the safe side (but good enough for its purpose), the ever-repeating looped sound of some turning cogs, and the missing Steam Achievement for completing the game without any hints.Also: the lack of presence from Tommy Wiseau is disturbing. You are tearing me apart Fireproof Games!"

You're opening boxes. It might as well have been a room though since all the same kinds of puzzles apply.This is a game that pretty much anyone can pick up and complete within a few hours.If you get stuck you can try to use the hint system - although figuring out the puzzles on your own is that much more rewarding.The game itself is quite short, but considering the price of entry it's still well worth it.I know for sure that I wanted more once I completed the game and my hunger for puzzle solving was far from sated.I went ahead and bought ""The Room 2"" (which was on 50% off in the Halloween sale for whichever reason - they're not scary... There's some creepy sounds and story, but that's it).I'll drop a review for that as well once I've completed it.In conclusion:Two thumbs up and a quirky smile. Great point and click puzzle game."

Throughout the game you'll find notes left behind for you, which add a little flavour to the overall experience, but there isn't any depth to it really. The best comparison i can give to this is a cthulhu-esque plot, an investigator goes down a rabbit hole and finds things which are beyond his ken.The gameplay is pretty simple, but its execution elevates it beyond most puzzle games. You manipulate bits and pieces on the box to solve the various puzzles on it, and you sometimes get an item for solving one of the puzzles in order to solve another puzzle on its surface, These can be pretty easy, while others can tax your brain a little if you aren't a logically minded person. What makes this game so fantastic though is the view point, everything is directly in front of you. Its really easy to rotate the box and look over the thing from a wide perspective, or zoom in to examine various aspects of it as you please, nothing is obscured, its just a matter of figuring out the correct order to solve each puzzle, in order to solve the greater puzzle of that section of the game before moving on. There is only one box, and its carefully designed for a fantastic experience. Unlike other puzzle games of a similar nature, your not going back and forth between different rooms or stations, wondering which station needs to be done next or if you missed something in a room five corridors back. It keeps everything focused, and this makes it far more enjoyable.Graphically speaking its not mind blowing, but for what its worth they took their time crafting a very intricate puzzle box. It looks very nice, and there were no bugs or glitches to speak of which i encountered that caused any issues.Overall, The Room is one of my favourite puzzle games of all time because of how well focused it is. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a quick, highly enjoyable puzzle game to just sit back and unwind with."

The graphics really are amazing.  I never expected such intricate details and textures in a ""simple puzzle game""!  The objects just look real with the shadows, reflections, and wood grain, etc.Puzzle-wise the game also delivers.  The puzzles are numerous, unique and logical.  None of the ""random connections"" of some ""point-n-click"" animated puzzle games.  Whenever I completed a puzzle that stumped me for awhile (with only a few hints from the in-game system) I always looked back and thought to myself ""how'd I miss that"" or ""I should have gotten that"" and never once did I have a ""What? That makes no sense!"" reaction.  Great puzzles that are sometimes challenging, but certainly doable.The only two minor ""negatives"" that can really be said is 1) it's short, which leaves you wanting more of this amazing world, and 2) it's not replayable -- but that's the nature of this type of puzzle game and I accept that.  So those aren't really negatives.  However, even though I wasn't that interested or care for the mystical story-line, it also didn't interrupt or detract from the puzzles or the beautiful environment at all.Despite being on the short side, it's an absolutely fabulous puzzler not to be missed!  10 out of 10."

The game has a dark and somewhat eerie soundtrack, mixed with background  noises such as the floor cracking or doors closing. But at the same time it is a very relaxing atmosphere, and when I was stuck I just sat in front of my screen, turning the camera around this complicated box, appreciating its complexity and smart mechanics.Speaking of complexity, the game is not that hard. Yes you can get stuck at times but certainly not for as long as you would in a game like Myst. So don't expect any tortuous conundrum as most of the puzzle is quite self-explanatory. It's mostly a matter of accurate observation and looking for details in every corner. Some riddles appear several times throughout the game, which to me felt like the developpers lacked the ambition to replace them with new ones.But in the end I appreciated the whole experience, and you can tell the devs have been through a lot of thinking to create these mechanical boxes full of surprises.

The ideal environment for playing is a dimly lit room with headphones.- The simple game mechanics of being centred on an object and able to interact with selected portions is used to good effect without becoming repetitive.- The variety of puzzles.Cons:- The sequel hook.

The story is told through letters and documents left to you by your missing, presumed dead, relative. The story is not the focus though, it's the puzzles and my mind was blown that you can actually make these type of puzzles. I always thought I was good at puzzles but the game proved me wrong.This game can be very frustrating at times as the clues can be both very cryptic and/or obvious, at least for me. Several times the answer had been staring at me right in the face and I did not get it until the very last clue was given to me. And several times, I had accidentally solved a stage of the puzzle but did not know it until I found the unlocked portion open or I was able to proceed to the next step. I admit I used a wiki a few times when the answer refuses to come to me but only after a good amount of time has been spent going over every solution I can think of and poking at every corner the puzzle has. This was done towards the end though, where the hardest puzzles are and where the clues are somewhat obvious but I am too blind to see it until the wiki pointed out the solution.I thoroughly enjoyed this game and am currently in my 2nd play-through. It is interesting that I completely forgot how to solved the puzzle at the very start and once again struggling to solve it with the answers that is so obvious.I would recommend this game as a way to kill time if you are waiting for something. I also recommend turning up the brightness as some spots are so dark that you can't see the answer(s) in some stages.I am still waiting for the developer to port Room 2 & 3 into PC as I am not sure if my tablet can run the new ones.

If something looks out of place, poke it, slide it, fiddle with it, do whatever! I turned hints off during my playthrough and didn't find that I needed them anyway. As long as your diligant about messing with every bit of every box, you'll be fine. For $1.24 on Steam sale, The Room offered a very fun 2 hours to my life. Super great."

It only took me 4 hours (one sitting) to beat it but it was worth it because I love how everything looked and made me think. It might seem short, but think of it as watching a mystery movie that you get to take part in.If you like the game ""Cogs"", you'll LOVE this.I love when a computer game encourages me to take physical notes as I play. If anyone were to find my notes and have no idea they were for a game, they would be very confused and think this nonsense comes from an insane person lol.Also..

The puzzles are not of a logically challenging nature, nor is the story a literary masterpiece. Yet, the game is engaging, and accessible enough that I can recommend it to anyone. Try it out for an hour, and if you don't like it you can get a refund. Otherwise, it should take about 6 hours to play through.The biggest strength of the game is its art. The artifacts are beautifully created, and they draw you in, every time you fit something together and cause another piece to unfold. The atmosphere and story complement the art well, but the art is the real star. The overall effect puts you on edge somewhat, but not enough to be terrifying (at least, if you are not a young teenager or child).The puzzles are of a hide-and-seek, point-and-click nature; each chapter is a sequence of small puzzle tasks. Trying to search everywhere through 2 to 3 times to find the right thing can sometimes get tedious, which is why I found the hints to improve game experience considerably. (Not to be abused, but if you tried everything and nothing worked, go ahead and use a hint.)In summary, whatThe Roomisnotis a hard-core puzzle game, nor a hard-core story or horror game (by any means). I recommend it especially for players looking for something casual, short, and artistic."

Any complaints I have would be about either the length or the somewhat lack of difficulty. The price tag, especially on sale, more than makes up for the length. And the lower difficulty still isn't without it's rewards. You still feel like you figured things out and accomplished something.

,Recommended,288160,12841360,"Posted: 8 November, 2014",all,UpInFlames,"You walk up the stairs, slowly open the door and find yourself in a dark room. Faint light is creeping in through the window and there’s a big spotlight revealing the room’s centerpiece. It’s a safe. A mysterious note on top encourages you to open the safe which will contain the answers you seek. There is also a small brass key. But it’s not the key to the safe. So you inspect the safe from all angles and find a small keyhole hidden behind a panel. It’s a secret compartment containing an eyepiece which reveals things not seen by the naked eye. There’s also another riddle. You solve it and find another key.Let me get this out of the way – The Room is amazing. It so effortlessly taps into that primal urge of curiosity and intrigue. Solving a puzzle in The Room evokes a childlike wonder. Mysterious clues and secret compartments will provide items and shed light on the inner workings of the box and your pupils will dilate every time you activate an ancient mechanism that will get you one step closer to figuring out how it all works. It’s gripping on such a basic level.The controls are delightful, you will use the mouse to push, slide and otherwise interact with objects pretty much in the same way you would with your fingers and hands. You don’t just click on something to open it, you slide that panel and turn that key. Just like everything else in The Room, it’s simple yet oh so effective. The puzzle design is absolutely spot on. It’s clever and varied, not too easy and it won’t cause you to bang your head against the wall either. If you get stuck for a bit, the game will provide little clues in order to nudge you in the right direction.The production values are fantastic. The art style is wonderful and the sound design is superb. The way that the light reflects on all the various surfaces and the little crackling sounds coming from the dark corners of the room is just amazing. Considering that you’re doing nothing but solving riddles trying to get into a mystery box, the fact that the game is so atmospheric is an astonishing achievement. My only complaint about the game is the sub par attempt at storytelling with a rather unsatisfying ending.The Room is a fantastic showcase of clever game design. It once again proves that you don’t need a huge budget or a big list of features to create something truly wondrous and engaging. All it takes is a good idea and masterful execution, something The Room has in spades.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)"

It's like Myst in a way, except the exploration doesn't happen with caves and islands – it happens with tables and safes.In this first-person puzzler you're searching for the two dozen secret nooks and crannies on each piece of furniture, along with a breeze of the supernatural and for lite narrative via letters.What bugs me the most is how ridiculously overloaded each level is, which results in a very laggy experience *and* unresponsive controls. It seems like the FULL level is loaded completely at the beginning of each chapter, with all the secret drawers, compartments, switches and items. And all that stuff has to be handled by the CPU with each new camera angle. Why is the polygon count so high? This is just a puzzler? Why does the game need to load the small ball of the final puzzle part when I haven't even opened the box in the box yet? It's way too convoluted!Oh, and it's way too short.But other than that, this game was mindblowingly satisfying for me.  And there are sequels, too? Can't wait to play them on Steam.7.o / 1o.o"

The Room is dark and the only source of light is a faint glow from a window and a spotlight on a stand. My gaze moves to the middle of the room and I can't help but notice the massive safe. On top of the safe I notice a letter which I proceed to open merely to find a key enclosed with a very peculiar note. After reading the note I'm left completely perplexed. I look at the key I was given but I quickly begin to feel helpless when I search for a keyhole somewhere on the magnificent safe.The key doesn't seem to fit into any of the strange openings or contraptions I spot on the safe. I start thinking less of the key and more of the safe. I begin to study the safe closely and analyze every tiny nook and cranny I can find. Suddenly, success! I found something! A tiny panel the size of a matchbox slides open...The Room really shines in my world. I love a good puzzle game and this title certainly gets the job done. As you start the game, you notice the soundtrack playing right away. The soundtrack doesn't feel repetive and still manages to support the atmosphere it wants to create very nicely. Besides the sounds, the puzzles are fun. When you face a seemingly impossible lock with nothing but mystery, The Room challenges you to think outside the box and solve it's many riddles. The Room gives  you a nice feeling when you solve a puzzle and coupled with very neat and detailed graphics, it feels genuinely satisfactory to solve a puzzle.When playing The Room, it's important to savor every bit of the atmosphere as it's a semi-short game but surely worth playing and spending time with."

I wish there were more puzzles like the first riddle, though it is tired and old, just as an example.Another big issue is the bug at the end. Upon completing a maze, if you can call it that, you are unable to move the last paces towards the finish, and must try to ram a virtual gem passed a virtual peg with your mouse. This took up about 30 minutes of the 2 hours I spent in this game, of which an additional 1 hour was spent looking around the objects for a button or hole i missed because those are considered puzzles.This game is not worth 5 dollars and I honestly think the creator had intended for it to be longer if only he could think of a way to end the story."

I give this game a whoping 10out of 10. but its not hard to impress me. but its deffinately worth the buy."

Controls may be a bit awkward at times due to the game originating on the mobile platforms, but it is one of the better ports I've experienced and it was never bad enough to ruin my enjoyment.  There seems to be an interesting story/premise peeking through, but unfortunately the game only gives you a handful of notes so all you're left with is a paper thin excuse for why the character's going through the hassle of opening a complex puzzle box.  I've heard the sequel expands on the story, but sadly The Room 2 is not on Steam at the moment.If for no other reason, you should support this game because it's a puzzle game that doesn't have Towers of Hanoi or a sliding tile puzzle."

,Recommended,288160,21868458,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,Seraph,"This is a magnicifent puzzle game, and that's coming from someone who doesn't generally care much for puzzle games and dislikes point-and-click controls, which this game has. It feels much more interactive than the average point-and-click, and is nowhere near as tedious.I don't want to explain too much about this game since every aspect of it just has to be experienced, which makes it a bit annoying to point out what I like about it. In short, it's just really satisfying to play because it has original and varied puzzles and the box, vault or table you're trying to open is constantly evolving as you progress. I've never played a more dynamic puzzle game than this one, which is ironic because you can't even move away from the puzzle, just rotate around it.I'm going to make a comparison to a genre that's so vastly different from this, but I feel like it makes sense. You know satisfaction you get from the fake sense of progress in clicker games where you keep clicking and make ""progress"" or get ""rewarded""? This game felt like that in a way, but with actual progress and more content to reward you with. The puzzles are built up so that you can do or find plenty of minor things and still progress or trigger other things on the box, vault or table you're on. In a way I got that kind of satisfaction from this game when solving parts of the major puzzle. The puzzles are also not overly difficult and don't require you to think of extremely far-fetched solutions that you would never have guessed were the right ones or where you just don't know how the game wants you to think, but you might still have to look around for a while and re-evaluate what you've done to figure out how to progress.I also really appreciate the effort the developers put into the PC release, considering this was on mobile devices first. The textures are way more high res and when you zoom in on puzzles they'll be very detailed and actually look good, with great lighting to boot. The click-and-drag mouse controls are a direct remnant of the touch controls the mobile version had, but it works really well and makes it feel quite interactive.Even though it's not saying much because I don't play that many puzzles games, The Room is one of my all-time favourite puzzles games because of its unique design and dynamic gameplay."

The more puzzles you solve, the more the machine unlocks, even transferring you to other rooms, etc.The game is originally a mobile game, but it doesn't show. The graphics are superb and the controls precise enough. Unlocking the machine is like an addiction. And even if you get stuck, after a while there are more or less helpful hints that should carry you forward. You of course don't have to read the tips if you don't want to. There is no time limit or anything. Only 1 puzzle requires a bit of timing as I recall, but very simply indeed. Most puzzles revolve around finding missing pieces, hitting hidden switches or aligning something in the correct order. Your helpful eyepiece, which shows a different kind of reality, is your trusty partner in this endeavour.For the price, let alon on a sale, it's definitely worth it. Just beware that ""The Room 3"" is currently not yet available on Steam, so for anyone wanting to finish the ""story"" (it's only notes really, but interesting nonetheless), you either have to play on mobile or wait. I'm pretty sure they will port the 3rd installment as well. Would be silly not to.One word of advice: One puzzle is currently a bit broken. A gem just won't slide the way it should. This is at the very end of the game and can be fixed by changing from Fullscreen to windowed mode (and/or also changing the monitor's refresh rate to 60 for whatever reason). Just google the problem. Too bad they haven't fixed that."

Take the overall and recent reviews for sure - it's an overwhelming game.The game itself doesn't last long. It took me 3h to play through it, but unlike other games which duration is such short ending with a bad feeling - not 'The Room'. You will be fully satisfied after.TL;DR:Recommended - lot of fun and satisfying. 9/10.The long versionDesc:You will start with a tutorial, which guides you through the first chapter to get into the mechanics. There is a background story starting in the tutorial about a scientist researching a Zero Element - based on old ancient symbols and objects from excavations in egypt.

It's still a fun little diversion you can get for cheep but if you've played stuff like myst and the witness don't expect much then again you can get this for like $2 and the game is clearly inspired by myst.If you found the other games like this too challenging or just want to kill a couple of hours this should be fine I just wished I had spent my time elsewhere.

I'd say this game is more about experiencing a short-lasting sense of mystery and wonder. Like watching magic tricks and sleight of hand, but more interactive. Don't expect a story either, or anything too meaningful.The puzzles are certainly on the easy side as they're essentially a combination of hidden objects and clues leading to other hidden objects and clues, but they're sufficiently fun to solve. The high quality animation and sound effects definitely help with that. The aesthetic is gorgeous; I caught myself rotating the view just to gaze at the scenery a few times.On a sour note, I can't say I liked the hints popping up constantly and tempting you to click them, only to tell you something obvious. It's a bit insulting to be told ""hey, maybe if I turned the thing up there, it might reveal things down there"" after about 30 seconds of exploration. The hint feature seems designed for bumbling idiots and was more annoying than helpful.In the end it's a satisfying work of art to interact with, and well worth the price. 15/20"

In the middle of a room is a giant puzzle box.  Your mission is to figure out all of the puzzles as you work from the outside in.  Image that as you choose one ""layer"" of puzzles that layer strips away to reveal yet another ""layer"" of puzzles on the box.The game is well made, the graphics are very good, and it is, without question, worth the time that you spend.An intriguing part of the game -- because you are only dealing with the box, chances are that you won't miss any key elements or pieces in the environment.  This is always something that I get frustrated with in a point-and-click puzzler -- if you don't pay close enough attention to the pixels you miss something.  There are no other rooms and there are no other puzzles except the box.  Therefore, you can't miss much.However, that being said, being limited only to the box this makes the puzzles somewhat easier to solve.  The puzzles are straightforward, requre only a modicum of intellectual effort, and aren't very complex.All in all, I solved this game quickly -- about five hours.  That's a good Sunday afternoon for me -- as a casual gamer I have to take my time when I can get it.  For five dollars, this game is an excellent distraction.  From a behavioral standpoint, you have to put in about the right amount of effort for a reward.  This keeps the player intrigued in the puzzles without losing momentum and becoming frustrated.Would I buy it again?  Yes.  As with all point-and-click puzzles, the replay value is low.  I can still, for example, remember the solution to Infocom games that I played thirty + years ago.  But it is interesting, you will enjoy it, and for a while you will embrace the escape from your career, your family, your life, and soul-crushing student loan debt.Buy it, yes."

I think putting everything in such a small location, leaving many mysteries at the start but fewer as each puzzle goes on, really builds a sense of progression toward the completion of each puzzle box, making it more satisfying than just solving a sequence of unrelated puzzles. The game is pretty smartly designed, too; nothing is really moon-logic to figure out and there's not really any repeated puzzles; everything feels fresh all the way through. It's not the hardest or longest of experiences but I quite enjoyed my time playing this game. Though it's apparently much cheaper on mobile than on steam so maybe pick it up there, ehh, I dunno, I felt it was worth the price of admission at 50% off anyways."

It consists of about half a dozen levels, each of which take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete. Every level is based on the unfolding of a very elaborate box, with hidden mechanisms, crevices and chambers. The complexity of the boxes increase per level, but not something to the tune of MYST or anything.It's not a long game, obviously and can be finished under four hours if you're not particularly hyped about it. But then again, it's very probably designed for very casual type of players, with little regard to narrative or replayability. There actually is a storyline but it's more or less a simple story of lost wonders / discoveries, et cetera.For the said casual player base, it's pretty decent. Presumably, an hour or a level per evening between dinner and bedtime is how it is supposed to be consumed.

I was amazed that a game like this existed because I'm a huge fan of the Hellraiser movie series which is about solving a Chinese puzzle which opens a stargate to another dimention.  That is exactly what this game is about!  Since watching the game on Twitch, I now have a gaming PC.  I didn't buy it to play games specificly however I've been using it for games recently.  I decided to track down what the title of this game is.  I searched for ""chinese puzzle table"", ""chinese puzzle box"", and all sorts of terms but they all came up blank.  I eventually found a screenshot of it on youtube and presto, its named after a Silent Hill game, ""The Room"".  No wonder I had a hard time finding it.  After finding it on Steam I downloaded it immidiatly and I was happy it was so cheap to boot.  The game was everything I thought it would be and it was a great deal of fun.  I love the Hellraiser cube gameplay and even the music sounds like the music box theme Christopher Young scored in Hellraiser 2 which was a true delight!  The only downside of the game is Pinhead didn't tear my soul apart and the game was quite short.  I beat it in the cumulative time of 4 hours probably.  Still for 5 dollars, 4 hours of entertainment is better then watching a 20.00 blu-ray movie so I really can't complain about this.  This was like an interactive Hellraiser movie and since Hellraiser hasn't been good since the 5th movie, this is quite nice.  This game makes me wonder if this was inspired also by the Freemasons.  I wonder if after the 3rd degree if one is invited (seldom happens), if they have to complete puzzles like this in the bigger lodges like in Philly.  Those guys have unlimited funds to craft puzzles like this so if they exist in real life, they would have them in the big city lodges.  On that note, there was a simmilar though not as impressive puzzle table in the Disney movie about Freemasons, ""National Treasure"".This game was so much fun it had me craving more so I'm currently downloading the sequal.  Even if its just another 3 or 4 hours of gameplay, at 5.00 its completely worth it."

76561197971597949,Recommended,288160,14704885,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,Purucker,"You'll want to go inside The Room. The puzzles and challenges presented by the safe therein offer several hours of entertaining gameplay.The Room is a fascinating game. You’re in a room with a well-locked safe, and your goal is to get that safe open. The game makes the story more detailed than that, but The Room’s storyline is its least interesting aspect. The fun comes from the hours of puzzles and challenges required to break open the safe, coupled with the game’s delightfully creepy ambience.There’s a lot to like about The Room. The first thing you’ll notice is that ambience mentioned earlier: The game’s graphics are excellently drawn; the faux three-dimensional room—and the safe it contains—look great, and are fun to explore. And the soundtrack and sound effects set a mood not quite of fear, but something entertainingly off-putting about the experience: Why is this safe so intricately locked up? What the heck is it protecting?(Okay, when the creepy whispers start in Chapter 3, yeah, it’s a little scary.)All that excellent mood setting and imagery wouldn’t amount to much were it not for the intuitive gameplay. You’ll need to navigate around the room to unearth discoveries—oh, this table leg can also unscrew to reveal a hidden key, and this seemingly plain panel masks a tappable portion to access another section, and tapping these buttons in the right order will open a secret drawer.Get into gear: You'll need to twist dials, push buttons, turn keys, and find all sorts of hidden compartments to finish The Room.As I mentioned at the outset, there is a story behind why you’re digging through The Room and the safe it contains, but that’s the boring part. The fun is the journey: figuring out how to solve the increasingly intricate puzzles in the game.If the Room aren’t fanciful enough for you, the game adds a further element of magic with an eyepiece you discover early on. From time to time, you’ll need to put the eyepiece back on to discover otherwise hidden imagery necessary to solve certain puzzles. That element adds a nice dimension to the gameplay.Hidden in plain sight: Secrets, knobs, and buttons will hide all over the place in The Room.Where The Room excels is in layering its puzzles upon further puzzles. When you find a key, you might also need to rotate pieces of that key to make it fit in the keyhole you discover. As you place cogs into a gear system, you might need to reposition some to get further along. And when you discover items that you can add to your inventory, you might in turn need to examine your own inventory to uncover the secrets those items hide.If The Room has a weakness, it’s the controls. I found them fussy and occasionally frustrating. You can double-tap to zoom in, but only pinch to zoom out, and sometimes getting those zoom gestures recognized in either direction takes multiple tries. Since zooming is an integral part of playing the game, that can get a smidgen tiresome. But the truth is, you—like me—probably won’t care. The game and its puzzles are so engaging that you’ll look past the intermittently annoying controls to get back to the intricately crafted puzzles.Bottom lineThe Room is great. The puzzles are both challenging and discoverable, and you’ll milk at least three hours of fun gameplay from the game. The graphics and sound are top-notch. If you prize replayability over those other factors, however, note that it’s limited; once you’ve completed The Room, it’s unlikely you’ll want to go through the entire game again. But you’ll probably get a kick out of introducing the game to someone else and watching them work their way through it.The RoomProsExcellent ambience, sound, and graphicsBrilliantly crafted puzzlesThree or more solid hours of addictive gameplayConsOccasionally fussy controls ( you—like me—probably won’t care )"

You are in the haunted attic of a mansion and you find an elaborate and ornate box. By flipping levers and dials, pressing buttons, putting keys in locks, and generally fiddling you slowly open more and more of the box and learn about the secret of the room. The plot is mostly flavour and mood rather than a concrete narrative. Puzzles are fun and generally fair. The game looks gorgeous. At 2-3 hours, I think the game is priced appropriately."

The ease of the puzzles also allows the game to flow really well. Only thing I missed was a bit of voice acting, instead you get text popups.Overall it's quite a well made game and fun to play, so why the thumbs down? The ending. Like many other mystery games this is also just a pointless tease.

I'm glad I did.First of all, this isn't just a puzzle game. There's an entire narrative going on here that involves the ancient art of alchemy and the pursuit of the ""aether,"" the fifth and final element that would unlock the secrets of the universe. This is real stuff, history-wise -- intellectual heavyweights like Plato and Isaac Newton used the concept to explain things they didn't understand about stars, planets, space and even the realm of the supernatural. To physicists and philosophers in antiquity, the aether couldn't be directly observed, but revealed itself in the forces of gravity and light.The ornate boxes in the room are left there for you by an alchemist on the precipice of discovering the secrets of the aether. But he won't share his hard-won knowledge with just anyone, and as he explains, the devilishly clever mechanisms safeguard the alchemist's secrets ""from lesser minds."" Fortunately, you're one of the enlightened, and the secrets of the boxes will reveal themselves to you if you open your mind and look at things from a different perspective. (Often, that's literal -- the answers to some clues will not be apparent until you look at a particular mechanism or clue from all angles.)It doesn't take long to realize the alchemist you're trailing is losing his grip on sanity. One of the impressive things about the game is that you not only recognize his descent into madness through the notes he leaves behind, but also by the increasingly bizarre and obtuse challenges he leaves for you.So, is there anything different about The Room on PC?Yes indeed. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is a port that gives a nice array of options, and the difference in visuals is dramatic compared to earlier versions of the game on Android and iOS. The lockboxes look magnificent, with ultra-high resolution textures and new detail worked into their surfaces, nooks and crannies. There was obviously work put into making this game look fantastic for PCs, and I appreciate any developer who respects the PC gaming community instead of taking the easy route and doing a straight port without improvements.If you haven't played The Room, you're really missing out.

I felt like I was being forced down a checklist instead of being allowed to naturally figure things out on my own. Sure, I knew the solution for PuzzleXYZ, and had what I needed, but the game wanted me to do PuzzleABC first, so I couldn't. I also found the controls, using a mouse on my PC, to be tricky. If I clicked just sliiiightly wrong, things wouldn't open and I would swivel around the box feeling frustrated when I had the solution all along, just not the... dexterity?Also, frankly, the camera angles were dizzying and uncomfortable. I felt like my face was being smashed up against the damn box while I bent over and twisted my head all around trying to see the details of what I was doing. I would have much preferred being able to drag the camera around myself rather than the awkward double-click, right-click, single-click nonsense I was given.The main reason I'm not compelled by this game is the plot... or complete lack thereof. Alchemy is so overdone and utterly boring, imo. I don't care about the alchemist. I don't care about or know anything about the character I'm playing. There's no real mystery for me to solve, so why should I bother opening the box? I'm assuming most people just love to solve puzzles, but I'd like to have a good reason for it.Didn't finish and I'm not planning to."

,Not Recommended,288160,29763125,Posted: 7 February,all,DocCovington,"""The Room"" is categorized as an ""adventure"" and a ""mystery"", but don't let that fool you -- it is neither. This game is merely one big puzzle -- a good one, but definitely not everything I had hoped for when I bought it. You can't truly feel the Cthulhu-esqueness of the story as it leads nowhere. There is no horror element and the mystery part remains unsolved. As a puzzle game, it is simple to solve for those who like solving puzzles, therefore that part remained void of excitement for me as well.On the technical side of things, even though the engine is flawlessly programmed, there are downsides, too:In order to zoom in, you double-click the left mouse button, but in order to zoom out, you press the right one; this occasionally leads to you accidentally misclicking, thereby cancelling an action or (worse) irreversably closing a view or letter that you have not finished reading yet. Furthermore, each time you move you have an acceleration and slowdown time. All this combined makes the mouse controls feel sluggish and unintuitive, and for those who like fast controls it often ends up being a highly irritating experience.This game has one of the most annoying background sound and soundtracks. Unfortunately neither can be turned off/adjusted in the menu. I ended up muting the game completely and listening to other music instead.The game's atmosphere feels highly despressing. I agree that the Cthulhu universe is not a happy place, but when I buy a Cthulhu-themed game I expect to be entertained with mystery and horror, not depressed by the graphics and sound/music.Overall, go ahead and buy the game if you want to be mildly entertained by a puzzle game of medium difficulty. If you expect more from this game, then don't bother or you will end up being as disappointed by it as I am."

A few mouse control snags, but nothing that can't be ignored.Unfortunately several strong 'themes' in its puzzling seem to repeat enough to venture well into 'the same thing over and over again' category.  Find the key (or equivalent) to unlock the next key to find the spot for.  Here, now look through these optics and line up this one specific shape...and here's another key--imagine that.  The game lacks variety or anything resembling a difficulty curve that I could see, it's pretty much just variations on the tutorial puzzle until the end.  It's a time waster.  Just switch off and play the game.I also now see that the ""fine individual"" who recommended this to me has just 0.1 hrs on record.

Even if you don't pick up the clues around you, some of them can be brute forced or just guessed. Often time I had a puzzle solve itself by e.g. placing stones in a random order at first just to find out it happened to be the right combination - that also kinda killed that puzzle which I find sad.The graphics and the audio are very nice. Found a few glitches were lids are not properly adhering to the containers they are covering, guess that's just an oversight. The audio though, with its creepy sounds and voices, is just on spot!

Both the visuals and sound are just beautiful, an amazing job, but aside from that I don't think this game has much more to offer.I found the puzzles quite easy in general, and as you play you realize they are kind of repetitive since most of them follow the same patterns, something that's just terrible for a game as short as this. Also, even though there's some sort of ""plot"" going on there, it's not as developed as you would expect. It seemed to me that they were trying to create some sort of story in order to get you more into the game, but what you get is just a poorly-developed plot instead of something that really hooks you and intrigues you, or at least something with a decent level of development. I don't think they put much thought into the story, it's clearly just a dispensable extra.tl;dr: easy, repetitive puzzles, and a poorly-developed ""plot"".Just my humble opinion (?)-----------------------------------------------------------------------Spanish:La verdad, aunque no puedo decir que no me haya gustado, no sé si lo recomendaría.El punto fuerte del juego es sin duda la atmósfera que logra crear, porque los elementos visuales y de sonido están muy, muy logrados y son geniales. La escenificación es hermosa, por así decirlo. Pero a parte de eso... no sé qué mucho más tiene el juego, la verdad.Los puzzles me parecieron muy fáciles, y más aún cuando te acostumbras a la mecánica del juego. Además, a medida que juegas te das cuenta de que son bastante repetitivos los tipos de puzzle que hay, y los patrones que siguen. Nada que te haga pensar realmente, en la gran mayoría de los casos. Además, aunque parece haber algo de trama, no está nada desarrollada, parece simplemente un pequeño extra para lograr engancharte un poco más, en vez de ser un eje central del juego. Da la impresión de que lo pusieron por poner, para ver si ayudaba a hacerlo más interesante, pero claramente la historia no está nada lograda y se nota que está por estar."

Having the double click as a zoom is disappointing because I feel like it lessens a lot of the mystery. Can't zoom into something? Mustn't be important and hence can't manipulate it.

That comes to $1.25 per hour of game play, which doesn't seem unreasonable by modern standards, though your mileage will vary.  You'll get a lot less bang for your buck from many so-called AAA games, at least if you pay full price.  My advice is don't finish it all in one go,  Do a chapter a day, then go play something else.I found the difficulty of the puzzles just about right.  Not too easy, but I never had to resort to hints or play-thrus.  We're not talking Myst here.Lovely to look at, at max settings.  Music and sound were atmospherically creepy, though sometimes gave the erroneous impression something significant was about to happen.If you like puzzle games, you need to get this one."

The Room involves solving puzzles based around complex machinery and contraptions, requiring the player to explore both visual (through an eyepiece) and functional aspects of a variety of puzzle boxes. Each level is a box, and you have to scour every inch of them in order to get all the pieces to fit together and reveal the next level. Coupled with extremely polished and realistic graphics that are accurate to the point of tiny details, this game is enjoyable to play as well as explore. And half the time I don't even know what I'm doing :D10/10"

I don;t think I ever felt challenged because I had too many inventory peices and didn;t know what to do with them. You pretty much get a piece, and as long as hyou have looked around a bit, you almost always know where it goes. So in that aspect it is a bit too easy.Still a fantastic game.

,Recommended,288160,18316831,"Posted: 3 October, 2015",all,kitten2021,"I have completed this game several times on my iPad and own The Room 2 on the iPad. When I saw this was released on the Steam Store for my PC, I jumped on it immediately and purchased it with high hopes of the game being at least a 'fair' port over from the tablet to the computer... Fireproof Games did not dissapoint in the least with this port. Ok, down to the over-all review... It's detailed, so it's lengthy.GRAPHICS - 9 out of 10I cannot say enough about the graphics in this game. The beautiful colors and the soft and occasionally hard tones used within this game are amazine! There are zero graphical glitches that I have ran across, the games settings allows you to change just how beautiful you want the game to appear - thus allowing anyone with a slower machine or with a powerful and fast machine to still be able to play the game. - Nice job in thinking of everyone Fireproof. Also, remember that basically ALL items had to be re-made by Fireproof due to the no porting over issues with Apple and Microsoft development systems... Amazing, huh?Why 9 out of 10 ? Well, there are certain area's where the game looks down-right beautiful, and then a odd texture (i.e. the wood floorboards) come into view and it just doesn't look right for the scene or the graphics are a little too dark, making things difficult to see - these incidents are only in one room a piece and it's just my personal opinion, others may have no issues with the graphics at all.SOUND - 8 out of 10The sound in this game is phenomenal! The sounds for each gear turning, the audible sound of a book brushing against a wooden surace, the sound of a heart beat pounding in the background ever so gently - it is just incredible... Almost breathtaking. On your first run through the game, you will most likely miss out on some of the sounds thats actually taking place in each room, but that's ok, the game is more than re-playable.Why 8 out of 10? The sounds are beautiful and great masterpieces of work to be sure. but in some instances I believe there might be too many sounds going at the same time, causing some sounds to be lagged behind and not playing at the right time. Example, I would push a button while there are several gear sounds playing around me and the heart sound beating in the background along with several other things - which causes the door I just opened with the button to not appropriately play the sound of the book sliding out. The books sound wave is delayed by a second or so... It might not seem like much to most people, but when you are really paying attention to the game, it's extremely evident. I've had this problem occure more than once... Possibly a good handfull of times or so through-out the entire gameplay.STORY - 7 out of 10The story for the game itself isn't really all that interresting the second or third time through, the first time through though it is extremely intriguing! The game guides you through a mystery of the mysterious Mr. A. S. as he slowly discovers what is truly taking place inside the house you have stumbled into. As you read his notes left behind, you start to understand bit by bit what he's gone through and how he unlocked the many Rooms you find yourself in. It is very interresting to say the least... But again, replay value for the story is rather low.Why 7 out of 10? The story, again, really is interresting the first playthrough, but after that the mystery has already been discovered and there is nothing more to learn... There is no hidden secrets to unlock after playing the first time through, there's no new magic to the tale. Its the same thing each time. Additionally, you never really know who AS is in the letters you find... There are bits of the story that leave you begging for there to be one more page or two to help fill in the gaps of the mans craziness, but you are sadly left with nothing.I KNOW this is only Part 1 out of several other parts as on the iPad, but knowing that there will most likely NOT be a continued carry over of the series from the iPad to the PC, they really needed to fill in the gaps in this port and not leave the player trying to guess.PUZZLES - 10 out of 10The Room is strictly a puzzle game, despite what anyone else says... It offers several puzzle, from hidden compartments that can't be opened without a password - to which the password can't be obtained without unlocking two other compartments with keys or gears, to puzzles that require you to align the images together through tricky lighting, there are even a couple marble puzzles requiring you to get the marble from Point A to Point B on the board. There is a little bit of something in this game for all kinds of puzzle lovers!Why 10 out of 10? The game offers you one difficulty: A Medium Hard, if that makes sense. The game really isn't easy, some puzzles are extremely simple, while others are so difficult you'll spend a bit of time staring at the puzzle trying to figure it out (yes, I'm looking at you, you evil keyrings with several different options for how you are aligned!!). The game IS solvable without using any tips, but even I on occasion when I first started playing the game needed to use the tips offered in the top left-hand corner of the screen, the puzzles can be THAT hard. What can I say... The puzzles are great! I have nothing negative to say about them. :)CONTROLS - 8 out of 10The controls for this game are soley dependant on the player using their mouse and either throwing things around with it, spinning things with it or flixing them off the screen... With a mouse. The controls are fine and all, I have experienced zero glitches with any controls at all.So why 8 out of 10 then? Let's remember one thing, this game was originally designed to be played on an iPad. A device that allows you to utilize the use of your fingures to move things around a lot easier... On several occasions I would come across a point when turning a dial or trying to pull on a handle that the game just would not respond very quickly to the mouse, at times making me want to forgoe the mouse and just reach into my monitor and grab the drawers handle and pull on it that way instead - sure would be a lot faster and less annoying than the mouse. >.>  I played this on my iPad prior to playing it on the PC to get a feel for how different this version would be, and the controls are indeed very different... Does it take away from the over-all gameplay? No, not really. It just gets annoying at times is all.STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS - 5 out of 10I won't hang on this one for long, I was actually saddened at the fact that I only got one achievement per level and nothing for how quickly I got through the game, nothing for finding and reading all the notes left by AS, nothing for using zero hints. I was seriously dissapointed... Although, I am glad I at least got something. I even earned a couple badges from the game after completing it - not bad I guess. But still not happy about the lack-luster effort on the achievement area.REPLAYABILITY - 8 out of 10The Room is definetely something I will be returning to! I have zero problems with playing this game over and over again until I have over one hundred hours of enjoyable time spent in the game. Am I still saddened by the lack of achievements for coming back to the game to continue my enjoyment? Yes, rather seriously too, but it still does not stop the pure enjoyment I get out of playing theses Rooms and trying to think through each puzzle I run across. Each Room is just astounding in color, sound, difficulty and ambience! I am seriously happy with how enjoyable this game is and will continue to enjoy it for many months down the road.There you go folks, hope it helps someone out!"

This game is what it says it is, it's a puzzle game.

I realize comparisons to Myst are inevitable when it comes to such games, and there are certainly some stylistic similarities. However, given that you're interacting with a large puzzle box, it's much more static than Myst and the detail goes less into the environment and more into the minutiae of the gizmos.Overall, the puzzles aren't too challenging--most of it is spelled out pretty explicitly, and there were only one or two sections where I actually had to get out pen and paper and write things down. It's beautifully designed and has a creepy Victorian atmosphere. For five dollars, it's a great game to put on your favorite instrumental album to and tinker around with. My only complaints are that it's too short and some of the puzzles could have been more challenging. That being said I enjoyed it immensely."

You are in fact following in the footsteps of a friend or colleague who has disappeared. Hidden in the box is a treasure that is also the answer.The puzzle stages themselves require some mystical paraphernalia and solving them can invoke some mild paranormal drama that makes the stages feel satisfying. It is this gently sinking immersion that pulled me in and made me a fan.The puzzles themselves involve checking over the beautifully crafted box itself for hidden mechanisms and codes that require concentration and deduction but are thankfully not frustrating. The graphics are beautiful and intricate so this type of exploration is a welcome part of the experience. The controls and camera viewpoints work well which is essential for this kind of investigative mystery. Optional clue flags pop up to help guide you if you want to click on them.It is clear that the game is crafted to take you on a (relatively short) journey of discovery rather than present a series of difficult brain-teasers. In this vein, the puzzles are really just invitations to look deeper through a glass darkly, so to speak. This game is absolutely worth a look."

Trully a feast for the eyes.The music and other sounds? spine tingling good, sometimes I thought this was a horror game, thanks to the music. It just builds pressure and conveys mystery.Then the concept. really, nothing wrong with it. They place a closed box in front of you and say ""don't you want to know what is in there? okay, then use your brain to get in there!"". And we being ofcourse want to know what is in the box (if you do are not a person who wants to open their birthday present right away, then this game is  not for you!).Now the meat of the game, the gameplay.It is an simple puzzle game, but that does not mean it is easy! Have a pen and some paper nearby, because you are going to need it! You have to do almost everything  and that is strangly nice.   You do not just pop the key in the hole and hoppa! the door flies open! No, you have to turn the key, and open the door, unless it is a overly complecated contraption, which , to be fair, the whole box is. The puzzels are varied and well thought out, some are easy as long as you find the right combination. Some seem really hard untill you remember ""Wait, that eyepiece should work!"" and a patern will pop up. And some just need many, many parts to work. Theoretically you could luck your way through a few puzzles (I sure as heck did).Story.There is not really a real big story in this game (what did you expect). Some one you knew, dissapeared and left you a closet in his house. You may have what is inside, if you crack the safe/closet/box/room. in the first few chapters it seems like a weird technological wonder, but it becomes more magical, the further you get. The game is devided in 5 chapters, in which little to no story elements are dropped, all you have are the letters signed with an ""A"", which tell you a bit about its former owner. End the end is something I will not spoil.Verdict 8/10 if you like puzzle games. For the price of 5 euro's or how many dollars it might be, it is a must buy for anyone who wants to be ammused for a few hours."

It does loop around a bit, but you really cant hear it when you consentrate on the puzzle before you. Playability? Awesome. Replayability?

For a ridiculously small amount of money, you will lose at least an hour of your life, probably a bit more. This game is immersive enough that it gives you the genuine sensation of pawing at the myriad contraptions throughout the game, figuring out their individual uses and how next to progress.Some people will lose patience with this game quite early. This game is not for the impatient. It's an enjoyable game with an excellent concept, beautifully executed in the new PC re-release. The 3D Anaglyph perspective puzzles are sadly disorienting at times and may cause issues for people prone to headaches, but they aren't too numerous and aren't too difficult to overcome. The cardinal sins of this game is it's relative shortness and the longing it evokes in the player for more of the same content. That said, the game is short and sweet, an excellent taste of what many might hope to be a continuing series.Additionally, if you're inclined towards satisfaction from overcoming adversity, turn off the hints. A lot of the difficulty in my <2 hour playthrough came from simply forgetting about a puzzle I'd meddled with earlier in the game and decided it wasn't yet time to fool about with it, followed by me entirely forgetting about them. Your mileage may vary but the time for a blind playthrough would be anywhere ahead of an hour, depending on the individual. For the current price, well worth it."

The game has a minimal story, in which the player is told by letters of a mysterious box in a room in a house; as the player solves the puzzles around the box, more notes from the same author - one who previously had solved the mystery of the box - are found, describing the box's use of an ethereal material called ""Null"", as well as showing the author slowly descending into madness.On starting the game, the player is presented with the first of four puzzle boxes. The first box is offered as a tutorial to the game's controls, which demonstrate how to move around the box and interact with features of the box. The player has a small inventory for items like keys found in compartments in the box. A key inventory element is a special lens that, in-game, allows the player to see things made from the Null element that compose parts of the box. The lens can generally be equipped at any time to see these secrets, often requiring the player to manipulate the view to align secrets into a coherent symbol. The goal is to fully unlock each puzzle box, extracting a smaller but more complicated box within it.The Room is great. The puzzles are both challenging and discoverable, and you’ll milk at least three hours of fun gameplay from the app. The graphics and sound are top-notch. If you prize replayability over those other factors, however, note that it’s limited; once you’ve completed The Room, it’s unlikely you’ll want to go through the entire game again. But you’ll probably get a kick out of introducing the game to someone else and watching them work their way through it."

,Recommended,288160,12819893,"Posted: 6 November, 2014",all,Pogo,"At first, I thought The Room was going to be one of those ""Escape the Locked Room"" games in which you click around a series of Myst-like still frames in an interior space, collecting random bits of broken junk to make MacGyver-esque improvised tools and looking under furniture for tiny keys to open every lock except the door holding you in.As it turns out, the game is a series of intricate puzzle-boxes. You focus on a particular part of the current box and drag the camera around to inspect. Turn knobs, lift latches, find keys, and use your special viewing lens to find clues you couldn't see otherwise.This is the first puzzle-box game that I've really enjoyed. The controls are tight; I never felt like I was having a difficult time getting the camera where I wanted it, despite the game taking place in a 3D space.I never played the mobile version, but the visuals in this version are downright beautiful. The wood and metal textures never look painted-on. The lighting, floating dust motes, and occasional glow effects are very believable. One of the featured tags on the store page was ""Horror"", but while the music and ambient sounds add a sometimes chilling atmosphere, there's no danger or big scares in the course of the game itself. Seeing the tag made me think that the puzzle boxes might just be a vehicle for a scarier game than the trailer let on, and that wasn't the kind of game I was interested in playing at the moment.Due to the way some of the boxes are lit, I recommend playing this one with the lights out. I also used headphones, but that was more to appreciate the atmosphere rather than having sound-based clues.There is no achievement for speedrunning this game, so if you do play it, feel free to take your time. Being thoughtful and logical here feels more rewarding than trying to brute-force through all the puzzles. After all, the puzzles are what the game is all about."

I found myself able to figure out all the puzzles but one (full disclosure here, I did use the in-game hints, usually needing only one or two to set me on the right path to solve that particular puzzle and I only needed an online-walkthrough for one puzzle in the 5th Chapter. I knew what needed to be done but could NOT figure out the order for the life of me!).This game is also available for mobile devices and, in fact, was created for them first.

There's a somewhat thin story that serves to provide a bit of context as to why you're opening these boxes and add to the mysterious atmosphere. The writing is nothing spectacular but I felt it worked well. The puzzle boxes are beautifully designed both visually and as puzzles to solve. I didn't find the puzzles that difficult, but it was still rather satisfying due to the nice balance of visual design and player interaction.I only got stuck a few times, usually because I missed a clue that was designed to be rather hard to spot or I didn't realize something could slide. A hint system is in place for when you do get stuck, starting with general hints and then getting more specific as time goes on with you not progressing. It was a nice feature, but the first several hints it gives you before giving more specific help tend to be so general, that they're not particularly helpful and may come of a bit patronizing.

What I got was a Fantastic puzzle game with a immerse story and beautiful 3d modeling. When you begin the game you are in a room and have to open a safe. What stars as a simple task quickly turns into a multistructured puzzle using point and click inventory system to gather items for future puzzles. The camera is fixed on one 3D object and you rotate the camera around the object and zoom in and out by clicking. This design choice is fantastic for focusing on the puzzles while still being able to build an atmosphere. The music in the game is foreboding and there is a great sense of the unknown creating tension the more you play. The puzzles themselves are top notch. The difficulty is just right being neither easy nor difficult. After about a minute a hint button appears that will give you a nudge in the right direction if you get stuck. The game length is 2-3 hours but for the budget price its well worth your money. My biggest gripe is the cliffhanger ending and the sequel not being on steam. This is now one of my favorite indie games and I highly recommend you give it a try.
,Recommended,288160,21357432,"Posted: 20 February, 2016",all,CharmingViking,"Definitely one of the best puzzle games I've played in a long while.The puzzles are one of The Room's strongest points, as they should be; while I've had trouble with games like Myst and escape-the-room type games in the past, The Room's design seems to avoid all of those problems. Rather than traipsing across an entire world looking for clues, you always have the option to view every relevant element of the current chapter's puzzle box simply by zooming out, a detail which, given various memory problems I have, was much appreciated. The Room also relies more on observation than pre-known knowledge; for example, many other puzzle games I've played required a basic understanding of Morse Code, ciphers, confusing mathematics, and/or specific logic problems. However, all of the puzzles in The Room (save, perhaps, one in the beginning, which gives you a visual guide anyway) can be solved through observation of the object in question, and there are no drastic leaps of logic in how to solve things.The Room's tone is also quite strong, though the story doesn't quite catch up. The use of atmospheric lighting and eerie sound design (which gets eerier the closer you are to solving important puzzles) gives a feeling that we're going much further down the rabbit-hole than we probably should, and letters from the creator of the various puzzle boxes give a bit of backstory; however, at the end of the day, the story has little relevance to the actual solving of the puzzles, and the ending doesn't really wrap anything up. This is a small annoyance, however, as the gameplay & visual elements of The Room are strong enough to support the strange plotline.Though it's obvious that The Room was originally developed for some kind of touchscreen medium, the controls are still very tactile and fun to use with just a computer mouse, and the updated, more detailed graphics are a nice addition in return. There are a few elements that do act up a little bit (notably a dial in Chapter Four that must be used several times, and a turning mechanic on a puzzle in Chapter 5), but in those cases there are certain movements that make them much more consistent, and the hiccups are few and far between.I feel that The Room was of a good length for the price I payed (as I finished it in just under two hours, spread across two days), though at the same time I am left wanting more. Luckily there are a few sequels out there to scratch that particular itch!"

You basically tinker around with a box which is laid out in the middle of the room. The game really should have been called The Box.Your objective is to figure out how to open The Box. You are required to complete one puzzle to gain access to another puzzle which is positioned somewhere else on The Box. I world not go far to say it is highly challenging. The hints in the game practically gives you the answer. If I had known this I would not have had them on the default on setting. There where two occasions were I did get completely stuck and I needed to rely on a game guide within steam. This was towards the end.The graphics are highly detailed for what is a simple puzzle game but it does add atmosphere to the environment of the room. This is the only mention of the room you are going to get.Sound effects again are highly detailed and brings The Box to life when tinkering around with it.Highly recommend this game in a Steam sale. The puzzles are simple and presented in a highly detail fashion. It is well worth a go.

It's way smaller, though, but also way cheaper (given that Myst launched as full-price-titles). I really liked the look of the contraptions you're working on. Yep, that's a difference. You always work on a single, if very detailed, object filled with small puzzles. To me, it was worth both my time and my money. The story is not too bad and doesn't distract much from the puzzles. It fits, but doesn't leave you on the edge of your seat, waiting what might happen next.The negative reviews aren't all wrong, though. The puzzles aren't that hard, hardcore puzzlers might be disappointed. And you don't have to write anything down. The hardest things to memorize are five-letter-words, three-digit-codes or patterns of Xes on a 5x5-square. What I can't understand is the complaint about the game being too picky concerning how you arrange certain patterns. What happens is: When you have to arrange a certain pattern, it has to be visible for a little while so the game knows you didn't create it by accident. That's it.So, to sum it all up: Buy it when it's on sale, you can't go wrong and got yourself a neat, short, beautifully designed, not too hard puzzle game."

There’s some variety but that’s essentially it.What makes this game a joy to play is watching the clockwork compartments whiz and unfold once you’ve found them.  Every detail of this game is stunning visually and many puzzlesemploy the use of a spyglass that allows you to see hidden glyphs overlaid on surfaces from (presumably) another dimensionwhich is insanely cool.Visually this game is spectacular, however I found the puzzles quite easy and rigidly linear, serving less as the point of the game and more as an incentive to examine the crafted boxes from every angle.In this respect I’d probably liken it more to a walking-sim such as Dear Esther than a tricky puzzle game, where the intent is for a relaxed, atmospheric play through rather than anything competitive or challenging.If you’re looking for head scratching puzzles, this is not that. However if you’ve ever stared at the inner workings of a watch and thought it was cool, then you’ll love every minute of this game."

Fingers crossed that they will get the same treatment. The story unfolds slowly, through hidden slips of paper and the complexity of the machine puzzles you are unraveling.  This is not a game where you are trapped in a Room trying to escape, but more like someone has pointed you to a table with an alchemical puzzle box and left you alone to figure it out for yourself.

I originally bought this game for my tablet, and I've played through it on there at least five or more times. I absolutely loved it from the start. Even when I got stuck (""I SWEAR TO GOD I HAVE POKED EVERY SIDE OF THIS STUPID THINGWHY IS NOTHING HAPPENING"") I flat-out refused to look at the hints. The answer was there. I knew it was. I just had to find it. If I were really in this strange room, trying to find the secrets of this strange box, I wouldn't havestrangemagical hints to help me.The puzzles are clever and ""logical"", so to speak. There are elements of the supernatural, but there's none of this ""collect ten bear asses and then go shove them into a colour-coded door, then press some piano keys, and oh right I hope you found half of a silver key hidden in a doghouse after luring a rabid squirrel away with a handful of nuts"" nonsense. Everything here makes sense within the world of the game.And the world is actually a huge part of the game, for all that you're trapped in the eponymous room: the atmosphere in this game is amazing. I was so immersed in the game's world that I got excited with every new thing I uncovered. I felt triumphant when I figured out a hidden latch or how to enter a code. I couldn't wait to figure out the secrets. I sort of flailed when I got to the end becauseholy god, so cool! SO COOL. The free Epilogue is excellent as well, and really adds to the game.I was a little nervous about it being ported to PC, but they've done an amazing job. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and the gameplay holds up just fine. I think it loses a bit of immersion due to being played with a mouse instead of a  touchscreen, but that's no fault of the dev team.Get this game. You will not regret it."

,Recommended,288160,12857868,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,DevSpark,"A very nice little puzzle game!Gameplay:The entire game centers around the box to be opened. Covered in riddles and hidden mechanics you have to open all locks to get to the inside - six times, boxes are inside another kinda matroschka style and each box is a chapter of the game and quite different from the others. With mouse-only you'll be able to search all sides beside the bottom of it ('cause it's placed on the table).On top of that you have an occular which will show magic-ink and 3d-effect riddles on some surfaces.Left klick is for interaction or dragging the camera or objects, double klick for zooming in and right klick for zooming out.Story:It's held to a minimum. You start out in the room with the untuched box and find your first letter from - whomever - which will give you some first hints (the tutorial). Later there are more letters addressed to you telling the story of a scientist on his hunt for the 5th element.Graphics:I really like the graphics of the game. It is nice looking but not overly stressing - pretty nice balanced. I didn't bother running the game on my dedicated graphics card, I just used the on-board card (HD 4600) and it ran fine.Puzzles:I wish they would put such puzzles into adventure games. They are not too hard but it's fun and satisfying solving them. Though you have to look careful it's not an hidden object game. Most of the time you have to get some mechanism to run either to get some needed object or another hint. The solution is linear but doesn't feel like it, that is to say each puzzle builds up to the next within a chapter with a fluent transition between the them.Gametime:I guess the game takes about relaxed 5h to beat.Verdict:For people who like point and click adventures or riddles overall this is a nice little addition to the library. They really cut it down to the puzzles only but very successful so it feels like an entire game-experience not necessarily missing something."

However, if you own the ios or android incarnation, I really can't recommend this one, unless you buy it on sale. It's a great game, with graphical improvements over the phone versions, but it's basically the same exact game. No new levels or DLC. I give this game a positive review, no question and I suggest picking it up. But do so on your nearest mobile device, unless you get it on a good sale for steam. It's one of those puzzle games that makes you think, but it's not going to make you insane either. 5/5"
,Recommended,288160,16177867,"Posted: 3 June, 2015",all,"RebelD, Empress of Death","I would classify this game in the categories of Advanced Puzzler. The puzzles can be a bit complex at times though a great deal of tinkering around and you'll figure out what you need to do. There is not a terrible amount of hints as to what to do to solve a particular puzzle, more just click, drag and oh hey, that's what I'm suppose to do. You will probably figure out how the game rolls after the first or second chapter but if not, there are some great guides on steam.Story is complete poop. It eludes to all of this ""wonder"" with a hint of arcanic and demonicness and then it just ends. No conclusion no clue as to who the hell left you the ""box"" (amongst other things). But eh, this one really isn't made for stories.Game play wise, its kind of sluggish (probably to make it last longer) and the cursor isn't always sinked up with your mouse. If you can get over that, its kind of actually decent. Nice creepy-ish music and lighting, graphics could be considered decent (then again this isn't an intense FPS that requires awesome graphics, but still this little remake they did is nice).Pros:-""Mind bending"" puzzler-Easy achievements/perfect game-Music is nice and fits-The graphic remake on this is quite niceCons:-Sluggish to hypersenstive (it kind of varies greatly, like sluggish when you need to move to the other side and hypersensitive when you are trying to align something up)-Mouse/cursor don't always add up-When turning an object, it doesn't register the motion all the time, thus bring brief moments of frustration (not at the puzzle but at the freaking controls)Ehs:-Story is kind of blah but its a little hard for puzzlers (particularly ones only focused on boxes) to have a story. If they had an expansion or second game then it might make a little more sense storywise.The ending is like, wtf just happened hahahaOverall: 8.5/10"

The music is atmospheric without being overbearing and the clue sound effect is noticeable without being annoying. The controls are fine. That being said I do ave a couple of issues and complaints:Two puzzles I completed solely by accident. One involved four coloured orbs whose orientation was affected by your perspective. I started moving the camera around to see if the orbs rotated in any particular way... and I solved the puzzle. I don't even know how.The clues can be downright useless and borderline condescending.  For example, in the puzzle I mentionned earlier, after moving the camera about for a few seconds to see how the orbs reacted I get a clue saying that the orbs are affected by my perspective. No♥♥♥♥♥♥sherlock I realized that already. Another clue on another puzzle told me to look at the right side of the structure. The structure was a cylinder. I'm not sure if a cylinder has sides (aside from the top and bottom of course) but with no way of knowing what was the ""front"", being told to look at the ""right"" side doesn't help much.Plot. Without spoiling it too much another character leaves you a series of notes regarding his discovery of a fifth element (as in earth, fire, water and air. Also no relation to the movie) called Null. It plays an active role in two puzzles but it's sort of forgotten after that. There is a plot but it seems that the writer fell asleep or went for lunch and the devs published the game before he returned. There are passing references to alchemy, but that's about it. Maybe I'm just dumb. Maybe it'll all be explained in a sequel.I'm not sure if I can honestly say I recommend this game, however I got it for ~$5 on a steam sale. If you like puzzles, buy it."

The puzzles range wildly from absolutely brainbending in a few scenarios to painfully obvious in the immediately following one. Standardized, step-up difficulty is not a thing here. I have to agree with some of the negative reviews here in that the game is -very- picky sometimes and unless you have it -exactly- right, you won't get credit for doing something properly.  I never had an issue with doing things out of order, but I guess it could happen... If you're any kind of cryptography nerd, some puzzles won't be hard for you at all, given you have any idea what a brute force attack is.  I completed this game in almost exactly two hours.On the other hand, the game is -very- pretty, and the lack of any serious contiguous storyline means that the puzzles become the theme of the game.  It's a good game to Zen out to.Over all, if you manage to pick this game up on sale (as it is right now, for $1.24), you really will be getting a decent game for your cost.

Although there are only a couple puzzles, they are complicated enough that the amount of time you spend on each one will vary greatly. It looks great, and has a great atmosphere, but the story is a little weak, which isn't that much of a loss. The controls are intuitive and rarely malfunction.

I'm ashamed not to have discovered it before now.   This is not your average point and click affair roaming around lots of locations gathering inventory items. Oh no !It's just you, in a room looking at a table on which is perched a strange, ornate, largish wooden box that it jam packed with secrets.   From one single first clue you are left to thoroughly examine every aspect of the strange box looking for clues as to how to get inside it.  Its feet, its sides, panels, placards all have secret clues, and hidden functionality.  What is this thing?As you progress you discover hidden drawers and compartments, clockwork mechanisms for which you need to find cogs, and keys and winding handles.   You soon begin to understand that this is no ordinary box and is much much more than a Japanese puzzle box.The graphics are utterly utterly, let me say it one more time, utterly exquisite.  The experience is breathtaking from the start sucking you deeper and deeper into the secrets of the box, examining every inch of it for clues which will help you unlock the next part of it, peeling back its layers like an onion, puzzle by puzzle.  What's more, you don't just point and click, you are required to move things yourself, such as turning keys, dragging drawers, winding handles, sliding . .  well slidy bits of the box !  This makes the game so much more engaging.I have never played a game like it, and am currently eagerly downloading The Room Two for more !Make no mistake, this is an outstanding piece of software that will engage you, enthrall you and keep you interested from the first second to the last and will leave you yearning for more.The objects are rendered beautifully and the motion of the various pieces and components just staggers you over and over.   Boxes within boxes, waiting to be deciphered and unlocked through numerous tests and mechanical puzzles none of which are overly difficult but equally not giveaways either.Each time you think you are nearing the end the boxes surprise you and open up new parts, sliding, rotating, presenting new mechanisms and puzzles.This is the kind of game that deserves pride of place in a viewing cabinet to own for all time and no wonder it has won so many awards.  Just a truly truly pleasurable experience from start to finish.Please please Fireproof,  keep making more of these!N.B that I play games offline hence my time in teh game shown will be minimal.

While The Room isn't so much about THE room and more about the puzzle boxes you solve in each level, the high level of detail both in the graphic construction of the objects and how they work and the gameplay that feels as natural as if you were handling the puzzles in person is honestly amazing.Each level gets argueably harder than the last but rewards critcal thinking that makes you excited and eager to play the next level once you finish the last.  The only complaint I have is that it is so short.  But bear in mind this is a very high quality port from a mobile game by a small studio that cut no corners in making and remaking the pc port and could reasonably go for 3 times as much making the mere $5 fee a steal.Normally I would criticize a games lack of story, and to be fair there is story but it is sparse and somewhat... wanting, but it is refreshing for a game to be about to stand on its gameplay alone.  Taking this under consideration, I would say, for me, this game is the best puzzle game I have played since Portal 2.  Take that for what you will but, sale or not, BUY THIS GAME."

This game takes a different approach by making you double click to zoom in on interactive objects, and the game designers have done a good job making it clear what things you can and can't look at.Also, you finally get to control all the keys and wheels that you use by moving your mouse, a level of control that I've always wanted to have, but that typical puzzle/mystery games don't give you.Lastly, ""The Room"" takes place in, yep, you guessed it, a room, and more specifically involves examing just one object, albeit an extremely sophisticated object! This completely cuts out the whole ""omg-ive-been-running-around-this-map-for-hours-and-theres-literally-nothing-to-click-on-fml"" phase of most mystery games!Add to that fantastic detailed graphics and you have yourself one heckuva game, and for pretty darn cheap too!10/10 would double click everywhere again"

They're well worth that and if they come up in a sale then you'd be missing out if you didn't grab them. Highly recommended!Pros:- Several rooms, lots of puzzles in each.- Brilliant interaction mechanisms (pulling, turning, etc. - all new to me in this type of game!)- Clever feature that adds an additional dimension to puzzle seeking and solving (I'm being deliberately vague - it arises very early on, but I don't want to spoil it for you!)- Although it's linear in progression from room to room, there is a lot of back-and-forth with the puzzles themselves, which makes it more challenging and fun.- Tiered and non-intrusive hint system.- Non-puzzle story elements that are intriguing.- Much longer than some 'short' puzzle games such as Tiny Bang Story, but see corresponding Con.- Great visuals and scene changes.- Beautiful but non-distracting background music.Cons:- The story is hard to follow, but this didn't matter too much to me (and I love story).- There are the odd frustrating moments where you have no idea what to do, which is annoying in itself, and there are some puzzles which seem very easy - this leaves it feeling a little imbalanced.- Top-level hints are vague, which is sometimes good but in this case gets annoying, since you're most likely to use them in the aforementioned moments of bafflement.- Sometimes it feels that the hints take too long to trigger.- Not immensely long - I completed it in 3.9 hours and I'm not a fast player. But perhaps I would have become bored if they were longer, who knows.Well done Fireproof Games, great job :D"

Most time was wasted because of missing some visual clue or trying to align things properly.The story wasn't that great either.Expected something like the 7th Guest or alike but this wasn't half as interesting.Also too short.

Indeed, the puzzles are really easy to solve: you won't need to think a lot to figure them out, and the game provides a lot of advices, even when disabling them in the options. I was never stranded while playing, and never had to struggle in order to get the logic of the puzzles. Too bad, I like being challenged, especially in this kind of game. 2h30 to complete the 5 episodes (counting several breaks, so more or less 1h30-2h), it's too short in my opinion. Secondly, the story could be more complex and better written. It was neither enthrolling nor intriguing, though the studio tried to create a supposedly strange and mysterious atmosphere. I've never felt immersed in this poor story. If it was only for the story, I would've thought this game was created for 10-years-old children maximum. Which is not a problem in fact, but they should tell it.Nevertheless, the beautiful graphics and the atmosphere (visuals+musics) compensate for the poor narration and the easy puzzles, rising the game to an average level. The different boxes and platforms are really well made and beautiful. Besides, despite their lack of difficulty, several puzzles surprised me because they are ingeniously made."

And here you are, like a clockmaker, trying to open a box full of tiny srews and weirdly shaped keyholes, just because the man said that the tool for understanding everything is inside it.The music works amazingly, gives the whole place an air of mystery. When using the lens, you can notice a dust speck or two cross it, whhich is a really cool detail, too. The puzzles are easy so far, but demand your focus and good memory.Personally, I am thrilled there are no mathematical or calculation puzzles.It's all based on observation, conclusion and a ken eye for details.tl;dr - If you like mystery, ""visually"" based puzzles, and a story that will probably take four or five games to fully unravel, get this game.

The idea that you have something that has other facets inside hidden within layers of a box that unlock secrets. What might appear as a plain box with a few panels and holes turns into a box full of trinkets, keys, notes, storage compartments, etc. The more you find, the more you unlock within the boxes. You know, similar to the Russian babooshka dolls? This is very similar, but the methods in which you unlock all of the parts can make your brain spin quite a bit. the later puzzles are not simple at all and they really make you think . . .  outside the box? *badumts*I am certainly looking forward to The Room 2 for PC."

I want more. I can see that this kind of a production took alot of effort and time, and that I kind of charged through it in a short period... but it was quite intriguing and ejoyable.On a side note: There are several puzzles that require you to create shapes with various implements. Many of these I just suceeded at by sheer random chance... I know not how.End of the day, this was a great little puzzler with intense graphics, insance designs, and a nice, spooky, intriguing storyline to draw you through it.Buy this if you are thinking about it."

There were  also some nuisances regarding:-how precisely the mouse sometimes needed to be manipulated (which I understand probably isn't a problem for most people, but was sometimes rather irritating)-a puzzle piece being triggered prematurely in either Chapter 3 or 4 which required an item that I didn't have, so I knew I could'nt have possibly triggered it by accident (which might not havebrokenthe stage per se, but definitely confused me enough regarding my next step that I reset the chapter. Hints would have probably sorted me out quickly, but I wasn't using them, trying to prolong a  game that most reviewers spent a short time on and which I didn't expect to have much replay value. I haven't investigated the bug yet, or whether the chapter can be completed after triggering it--so maybe there's some replayability there after all?).The most challenging parts felt like they were caused by my having to exactly position the POV to see points of interaction, which was a bit of a pain since it didn't feel like part of a logic puzzle and more like a set of mouse-manipulation exercises. The puzzles themselves were satisfying to solve while perhaps being a bit on the easy side--the challenge is in finding pieces/puzzles rather than the actual solving, since everything you need to know is in the chapter."

If one of us got stuck on a puzzle, we could always figure it out together. It may not be a completely new idea, but the setup was fairly compelling. It really had us hooked from the start and we played through the whole thing together.  The puzzles are innovative and fun and we always wante to see what was going to happen next. The gameplay is solid, my principle complaint is with the control on the pc. Getting the camera to pan the way you want is not as pretty frustrating a lot of the time.  Clicking and dragging i♥♥♥♥es a lot of things difficult and is sometimes unresponsive.  While the story was suprisingly engaging, driven by little clues you pick up as you unlock more and more compartments, the ending was a letdown. Not a big deal for me though, this is not the kind of game I get for a gripping plot. Our only other complaint is with a certain puzzle at the end and the corresponding hints it gives. This was the only point where we relied on the hints and they were absolutely useless. They told us only exactly what was immediately obvious. We ended up consulting a video guide because, near as we could tell, if we did not, we would have to go through many combinations of color arrangements before perhaps find the correct one.Summary: I paid just over a dollar for this game.

I enjoyed solving the puzzles, which weren't too challenging and could always be solved using hints. The art work and the sound keep you on an edge throughout the game, and the puzzles are all logically put together. It is a rather short game, you can finish it in 2 to 3 hours depending on how fast you solve the puzzles, and the game has little replay value. Once you know the puzzles, the game has little more to offer. I might replay this game in a year or so once I have forgotten how to solve most puzzles.For its current price on sale, It is definitely a bargain you can spend an afternoon on.

It doesn't really feel like horror but mystery with a touch of the horror atmosphere that makes up for the generally weak story.Puzzles are sometimes too easy, but most are challenging enough to be solved with a little thinking without being mind-blowingly hard. Hints are there if you get stuck, but I never really needed themThe touchup of graphics on the PC version is nice enough. While there's not much to look at, what's there looks pretty good.CONSSome technical issues carried over from the mobile port (looking at you blue gem maze puzzle) but nothing majorly groundbreaking.A lot of the puzzles get reused over and over again and become a grind. Perspective puzzles are the main offender of this.Some of the required actions for puzzles feel a bit, 'off'.

,Recommended,288160,20987992,"Posted: 5 February, 2016",all,Storm,"SummaryThe Room is a point and click mystery/puzzle game that is reminiscent of Myst but with less mobility. The entire game takes place in a room if you could imagine that, and sometimes branches off into (spoilers)not a room in a surprise plot twist.I bought this game on sale for $1.29 USD and I think it was well worth that price. The game takes about 2-3 hours to complete and $5 is pushing it. (I generally like the idea of 1 dollar per hour played, but there are exceptions)GraphicsOverall the graphics in The Room are done rather well. The cutscenes are a tad choppy, but it honestly just gave me more of that classic Myst vibe. The graphics are good for what they need to accomplish, and I have no complaints here.SoundThe game opens at a comfortable ear piercing volume, which is always a favorite of mine. It's games like these that make me glad that I take my headset off when launching a brand new game. After you turn the volume all the way down to 1 or 2, you can begin the game without destroying your hearing. As far as music goes, there isn't a lot. What little music there is definitely is mysterious, but there seems to be times where the developers didn't know what direction they wanted to go in. The classic horror violin sounds start coming in, but the game isn't doing anything to creep me out, so it seems out of place when it drones on and on like a jumpscare is going to happen, when you know it isn't.Beyond the music, the clacks and clicks of the various mechanisms you're unravelling are all done rather well. Gears turning, cogs winding and keys unlocking all make you feel like you're actually accomplishing something.GameplayThe Room's gameplay is basically a series of puzzles with a light storyline attached. It revolves around I believe 4-5 or so objects that have components that open, close, shift and reveal new parts to solve. There are 5 chapters, with each chapter taking around 20-35 minutes average.The entirety of The Room is played with your mouse. You left click, right click and turn with the mouse. While this wouldn't be a bad thing, I do wish that maybe they had allocated one or two keys to do some of the interacting. There were plenty of times where I would try to get to something and I either slide right past it or I zoom in to the wrong thing. It was annoying, but not gamebreaking. Other times, the game wants you to zoom in to look closer at something. There's nothing wrong with that, but sometimes it wants you to zoom in twice or three times, which is annoying as hell. You see what you need to do and you're trying to grab at it, but it won't slide or press and it makes you think you're wrong, when in reality all you had to do was zoom in once more.Speaking of knowing the answer, that was one of the biggest issues I had in this game. There were a ton of times where I go ""oh I know what I need to do"", but then have to comb the entire object trying to find where exactly this one hole or cog is. I actually got frustrated enough to ask for a hint and it told me what to do but not where to go. Maybe I'm nitpicking, maybe that's just part of the fun. But it's just annoying when I have to thoroughly inspect a box with many of the same looking shapes for one particular one. I don't think I'd raise such a fuss about this mechanic if the developers didn't do what they did at the end. Towards the end of the game, you're solving things as usual, but once a new part of the table opens up, the camera immediately pans to the part you need to be that rather than letting you find it. And to be honest, I enjoyed that much more. It left me wishing that had happened the entire game.Overall, I would give The Room a 7.5/10. It was a lot of fun tinkering with different parts to try to solve the mystery of the various boxes, tables and machinery. There were a few improvements that I think could have made it fantastic. I would honestly be willing to give it an 8/10 if the base price were reduced to 3 dollars or less."

Die Story fand ich recht fesselnd und die Rätsel sind sehr ausgeglichen. Einige waren zu einfach, dafür habe ich mir an anderen etwas die Zähne ausgebissen. The Room hat 2 Nachfolger (The Room 2 und The Room 3), welche allerdings bisher nur als mobile App für Android, iOS und Kindle erschienen sind. Ich hoffe aber sehr, dass das Entwicklerteam sich auch noch an eine PC Version setzt. Dieses Spiel lohnt sich definitiv für Gehirnakrobaten. Die Grafik ist ebenfalls sehr gut gelungen.A brilliant game in my opinion. The story is quite fascinating and the puzzles are very balanced. Some were too simple, but others were a bit tough. The Room has 2 sequels (The Room 2 and The Room 3), which, however, only appeared as mobile app for Android, iOS and Kindle. But I hope very much that the development team also consists of a PC version. This game is definitely worthwhile for brain-teaser. The graphics are also very well done."

The picture will be more and more clear and you begin to understand the meaning of the art. Every piece you uncover leads into another one perfectly for what it does. The Room is not a game that discourages patience like many other puzzle games do. There is no time limit, no score, no competition to finish as quickly as possible, no heavy story that must be heard/seen. NB! The Story is optional to the game but not necessary to know. You're just in a room with a box in front of you, and you have to open it. That's the only objective. The game does have an eerie tone to it due to the setting being sometime around Victorian England. I would definitely reccomend The Room to people who appreciate what isn't looked at much like the setting, tone, music, style, approach from idea etc. This game will definitely not appeal to people who like action, adventure and other fast-paced genres. I wish only for the best to the developers to keep on making new puzzles and new installments in the franchise."

Essentially, the entire game is one interconnected puzzle where you must explore the environment thoroughly to uncover its secrets, clues and items, and then use them correctly to progress.The graphics are really quite excellent, especially if you crank the settings up in the options and along with the sound and musice goes a long way to creating a great sense of atmosphere, both mysterious and somethimes vaguely threatening.I found this to be an utterly engaging experience and picked the sequel up as well.

In a way it is a bit like an extension of the idea of puzzle boxes, which initialy seem impossible to open and one have to figure out step by step the way to do it. You can picture it eg. as the Lemarchand's box from ""Hellraiser"" movies(it even takes you to another dimension, not that horrifyng though ;-).There are real world puzzle boxes - but building such complex ones would be impossible (esp. just as a game for one person...). In a 3d game anything's possible so there are many surprises, although some ideas get repeated. Probably that's why the game is not longer - it is not easy to make entirely new such puzzles. Making new levels just mixing the same problems could get boring.Difficulty is relatively well balanced - it is not trivial, not very difficult (what can be very subjective of course...). Feels a bit short, but maybe it's just perfect not to be bored with the ideas and possibly annoyed with overcomplicated puzzles - considering wide audience. Like this I guess most people end the game wanting more, not exhausted and feeling happy that it's finally over...On the other hand - you may feel not being challenged enough (it seems to be my case - there could have been few more to pass ;-)Should it be actually considered as a drawback - just being too simple? Well, many (most?) game developers do this these days - try not to make people feel like fools playing their game... You may like it or not, but that seems to be their motivation to set level to keep for most people (their clients) content... I do not particularily like it - but in a way I understand it. Setting very high difficulty level for such game would result in very few people finishing it (without help). Note that it is not simple to make difficulty ""adjustable"" as you cannot just set more and harder to beat enemies like in RPGs or others...Maybe eg. they could solve it setting difficulty level higher and leaving the help option in case you are stuck - but this does not feel thatyouplay the game and winyourself.Well, shortly - personally I would add few more difficult puzzles to make it perfect.Technically, artistically nothing to improve - looks and feels very nice, graphics, ambient music makes perfect environment for such puzzles.Summary:+ interesting idea for puzzles+ technically OK+ artistically great+ gameplay feels very positive- a bit too short and too simple - adding few more difficult puzzles would make it feel more completeRecommended (esp. for people liking puzzle games)."

The mood and atmosphere of the levels was interesting but not interesting enough to take your attention away from the puzzles themselves. I also was a little confused by the story?? if there was one. Sounds like someone discovered a new particle or form of energy and... yah... Anyways. Other than that I had fun.

,Recommended,288160,30347522,Posted: 5 March,all,Dark Blue Monkey,"Well, that was absolutely superb.  I've played a lot of 'puzzle' games before, but absolutely NONE have come close to this.The game takes place in a supernatural setting.  You're investigating /something/ and are locked in a room with a quizically locked safe.  There's a clue that not all is as it seems, and you're given a few bits and bobs to get started.The game takes place in an absolutely stunningly rendered 3d world.  You are standing around the safe in a dimly lit attic, and need to get into it to find out what's going on.  You rotate yourself around the safe, to play with it from all angles.  This is no normal safe... You won't need a stethascope, light fingers and a cunning hearing to hear the 'clicks'.  Nor does this game play tricks on you by changing the way the puzzle works halfway though: None of that ""Oh, so the curly pictures on the backfground have just been decoration for the last three hours, well now you need to click on them, because of reasons"" nonsense.  I'm looking at you Uru!!!Right at the start, the game gives you a few pointers for free.. clicking on something will give you a bit of text for example.  the text basically says ""Oh yeah, anything's clickable or slideable, pokable, spinnable and generally faff-withable.  If you can zoom in on it, you can faff with it"".   And once you have this sage piece of advice, you're off.Fairly soon, you're doing inexplicable things with cogs, table legs, drawers, globes, and all sorts.  At some points there are literally SO many things to push, pull or twist that you really need a hint.    You can either persevere, or you can click the littke ""?"" at the top left which gives you a series of slightly-better clues each time you click.  The great thing is that you can't just go click-click-click to get to the clue that inevitably says ""poke the teddy bear's left eye, you dolt!"" (ok, I'm lying.. it'll just give you a REALLY good pointer).  No, the game needs you to think about the clue for a minute or two before offering up the next one.I only needed to use the clues two or three times in the game when I thought I'd poked everything.. But I forgot that objects have multiple sides! d'oh!As you solve each clue, you get more and more of the story.. Once you solve all the clues in the room, the door unlocks and takes you to the next room.    The actual surroundings don't come into it very often, but they are LUSH.   So much animation, and so much beauty painstakingly given to every texture just makes the game feel like a velvet jacket.Pretty soon, the story delves really far into the supernatural, and you find yourself solveing less-than-standard puzzles in  extremely unusual ways.  This is where the game really shines. It's 3d engine is so flexible, and so great at overlaying spaces into others.The game itself only took me a few hours to finish, and I suspect that's probably about right for most people.   If you like REALLY unusual, and REALLY great puzzle games you'll love this.The only thing you need to play is a mouse, at least one eye and a brain.  Preconceptions can be left over by the coat rack, thanks."
76561198062301493,Recommended,288160,30350737,Posted: 5 March,all,76561198062301493,"A game that provides a great experience for a very low price. The premise and atmosphere are what drew me in and I had a lot of fun clearing each room, excited with anticipation to what would come next. The puzzles themselves are not extremely difficult, but they do pose some challenge and solving them is really satisfying just because you get to see what effect it has. Some negative reviews call it no more than a hidden object game and while I can see where they are coming from, that's just too unfair. What really works in its favor is the concept where you are presented with an object, like a box, which you get get to inspect from all angles and ""touch"" it by pulling levers and such. This will open up (secret) compartments with puzzles to solve, which in turn will open up another part. This premise and the gameplay in my experience made it very immersive and elevates it beyond just solving puzzles.A special mention has to be made about the artistic beauty and I'm not just talking about the graphics. The creativity that went into the design of the ""boxes"" and how all of the secret and locked compartments work together is really something to be admired.I will say that the game is a bit short -- I even let it run for a while for the cards, so my actual gameplay was probably at least even half an hour less -- and the actual puzzles are maybe not as fun as the puzzling is in itself, if that makes any sense. But, the puzzles being not too challenging, also means that there is no frustration, which really benefits the ""thrill ride"" this game provides. And the game feeling too short also means that you wanted more and this is a sign that the game was really great to play."

It's not ridiculously hard, but it's not so easy that it's boring.Throughout the game, you are trying to unlock boxes. Sounds boring? Actually no. It's not. These boxes are so incredibly intricate and there's so much attention to small details that can benefit you later, especially with the eyeglass you're given at the start of the game.My only gripe about this game is that it's pretty short.

All I can recommend is that every time you zoom in, you try and move things every way, press every spot, and spin anything that looks like it can.

There's a thread of story glue linking the puzzles together but ultimately the main focus is on the puzzle boxes themselves -- nested one within the other and with a certain physicality to them, especially in the earlier boxes.This would be amazing to play in VR (if it supported such a thing, or if I had a VR setup, but sadly neither is the case at present).Some of the later puzzles sacrifice some of the realism, with more liberal use of your ""invisible ink"" eyepiece and parts of the boxes emerging from hammerspace or doing other physically impossible things (often also involving the eyepiece), but ultimately I don't think this detracts from the experience at all -- rather it adds to the atmosphere.Pixel hunts aren't entirely eliminated; most puzzles rely on you finding keys or other artifacts or clues hidden on or within the puzzle box itself; but nothing ever felt unfairly hidden, there were always clues for the observant.  Nothing really requires out-of-game knowledge, although there are certain themes that you would probably appreciate more with that knowledge.  (These are both good things, in my view.)Sadly it's fairly short, although it's also priced to match; one sequel is already out, and it sounds like more will be following, so there should be enough to scratch that puzzle-solving itch."

,Recommended,288160,26001651,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,ElusiveOne,"The Roomis a superbly executed puzzle game that demands keen observation in return for a rewarding sense of accomplishment duly earned through pure logic.Finding solutions is highly satisfying thanks to the magnificently clever and elegantly accessible puzzle design. You mostly recover objects and arrange them back in their rightful place, in turn revealing another piece of the puzzle, and so on. Uncover a linear series of clues as you reconstruct and activate intricate mechanical devices.Finely detailed environments look outstanding on PC. It runs on old-school UI with decent controls, completely void of traceable hints of its mobile origins. The game handles very well, though slow movement when examining objects could be improved.The game does feature repetitive instruments, such as keys of all shapes and sizes, numerous types of drawers, similar optical illusions and suchlike. Its underdeveloped backstory about a researcher's incredible esoteric discovery serves as a vague pretext for these elaborate steampunk puzzles. While the anticlimactic ending abruptly sets the stage for theinevitable sequel, these minor imperfections never hamper the fun.The game is mostly stress-free, despite an imprecise otherworldliness conveyed through the audio and some cutscenes. Only one puzzle requires some level of quick reaction.A solid 2-3 hours of entertainment, best played for the enjoyable puzzles, not the story. Definitely recommended."

,Recommended,288160,28852786,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,TheDContinuum,"This game is similar to those IRL puzzle rooms where you and a bunch of friends are locked in a room with one our to escape, where there are tons of puzzles to solve, doors to unlock, secret compartments to find. You are given a mysterious box by a friend, and you have to open it. That's it. But, your friend has, to paraphrase Emperor's New Groove, ""put that box in a box, then put that box in another box"" and so on. With each new box you unlock, you start from scratch with no idea what to do, and you get to rediscover it all again. It is also similar to those ""Escape the..."" flash games you see on Kongregate and other game sites where the puzzles really don't have to do with each other, but the graphics are way better than those.Pros:+ TONS of puzzles. The puzzles tend to fall on the side of ""find a key, which opens a thing, which you need to solve a puzzle to unravel another key"", but they are fun and diverse. Sure, there are lots of keys, but there are also lots of keyholes, so finding out where stuff goes is interesting.+ Art. It had a photorealistic feel, and then there was a kind of steampunk/fantastical element that was really cool. These boxes defy the laws of physics, but it really works with the story.Neutral:~ Somewhat linear. There are times when you can have items for multiple puzzles at any one time, but frequently you're railroaded into a correct order.~ Story is weak, but do you really need one for a game like this? You get snippets of this experiment your friend was running that has apparently gone wrong, but for me, it's all about the puzzles, finding out how far the rabbit hole goes, seeing your work pay off. I'm calling it a neutral because it might bother some people, but I didn't mind it.- Kind of a minor one, but some of the puzzles make very little sense. I often caught myself wondering why I was doing a certain task, what the purpose was. Like, there's the obligatory ""Play back this tune you just heard"" puzzle, a lightbending puzzle with mirrors, etc. but there's no real reason any of the puzzles are there apart from because they needed puzzles for a puzzle game. There are a few that require abstract thinking, which keeps it interesting. I guess it mostly works because you don't know how a puzzle's going to work because there are no clues from previous puzzles, and that's the point: to figure it out.Cons:-Short. My playthrough was 2 hours, max.- Controls are a little clunky at times. You have to zoom in to use an item from your inventory on a certain spot, then zoom back out when it doesn't fit, click and drag to move the camera, double click to zoom into a different spot. I like that you (mostly) get control of the camera, because it's pretty to look at and helps with the sleuthing, but all that zooming in/zooming out gets a tad annoying at times. Good thing it's a short game.8/10. It may or may not be worth the $5 list price depending on your opinion of these kinds of puzzle games, but it is certainly worth it on sale (mine was just over a dollar, and money well spent!)"

The puzzles are well-clued and interesting, but unfortunately the puzzle implementation involves a lot of zooming in and out, which was painfully slow.  A few puzzles revolved around twising a piece, zooming out, then zooming into a new piece to see what had changed.  The slow zooming sucked the fun out of what would have been an otherwise cute game.I did try reducing the graphics of the game, and that seemed to help a bit, but the reduced graphics caused at least one of the puzzles to lack enough detail to solve.  Ultimately I finished the game, but would have found it much more enjoyable if the game had used cut-scenes to bring up the close-ups of the puzzles rather than making me watch the cool graphical zoom each time."

There basically is no plot. You can technically get backstory with notes that someone left but it doesn’t matter, it’s not interesting, and it doesn’t factor into the gameplay at all.Gameplay:It’s a 3D puzzle game. You turn knobs, switches, match patterns, and other things to progress into the game. It’s linear and none of the puzzles are super challenging at all. Having all of the switches, knobs, and other things in one central box is much better than having it in a room where you have to look around as you can see all of the components in one view. You do have this monocle that allows you to see lines and handprints and stuff but it’s super obvious where you need to use it. The hint system is pretty good as well but you probably won’t need it. The entire game is mouse driven (it’s a mobile port) so the controls are fine.Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)The game looks ok.

There have to be hundreds of different mechanisms inside that thing.The solutions are easy enough to not be frustrating, but some require a good bit of thinking and are rewarding to figure out. And if you ever get stuck, a hint will be available after some time of no progression.The graphics show great detail in the boxes and have a repeated theme of neat astral symbols (especially later on), and the shapes and colors of the mechanisms blend in but still give sufficient information on what you can click on and move to solve puzzles. The music is minimal and fits the mystical atmosphere, and the sound effects are extremely satisfying when you solve something.The only problem I had here was that in Chapter 2 I had a graphical bug that hid the puzzle solution.If your graphics setting is at ""low"" in Chapter 2 an area around some gears may be pitch black without textures, and since I didn't know this I couldn't see the switch that was supposed to be there. After switching to ""medium"" I could see everything and continue, though with a lot of lag, but after turning settings back to ""low"" the texture fixed itself and there was no problem for the rest of the game.Definitely play this for a great puzzle game.

Chinese boxes and the ""Lemarchand's box"" from Hellraiser come to my mind.Really intriguing and fun, but there's one little thing I must criticize. All the time I felt like...

,Recommended,288160,32789946,Posted: 25 June,all,nightduck32,"Summary:The Room, not associated with Tommy Wiseau. You have inherited a safe from a recently deseased relative. I think. The plot is pretty vague, but it adds to the atmosphere of ""supernatural alchemy"". The actualy game is a series of boxes that are unlocked by completing multiple tasks, done either sequentially or simultaneously. Typically finding a key, opening a drawer, picking up a piece of metal, recognizing the shape and placing it on a similarly shaped indentation on the other side of the box, which opens a panel exposes a keypad, and now you have to search for the hidden combination. Trying to connect all the dots can have you playing for hours. And no longer, because that's how long it takes to beat the game.Thoughts:Contrary to the uninanimously high approval ratings, I would not count this as a ""great"" game. What makes a game great is being good at multiple things: world design, mechanics, story, etc. This game is perfect at one and exactly one thing: intuitive design. Meaning it leaves a serious of dots for you to connect but doesn't hold your hand while you search for the next dot. If a game is too helpful then it's boring, not helpful enough and it becomes frustrating. The Room strikes a perfect balnce and that's what makes it a brilliant puzzle game, but it's lack of substance and replay value means it can't be remotely compared to ""real"" games with deeper stories and time sensitive mechanics. So it's not the best game of all time, but it has it's place on a few niched top 10 lists."

,Recommended,288160,32804171,Posted: 26 June,all,Slain087,"You, uh...  You may want to have a monitor with good brightness settings for this.The Room is essentially an escape-the-room game with multiple ""rooms"". Your objective is to figure out this **** puzzle box in this attic. To help, you have your wits and a spectral eyepiece, which can sometimes reveal clues, look through certain surfaces; but mostly make it harder to see the boxes themselves.Unfortunately, since you're in an attic, there isn't much in terms of ambient light, so it can sometimes be hard to see puzzle elements.Hints are available for every puzzle element, and the game's nice about it - there are multiple clues available, which you unlock one at a time for your current element after some time has passed since your last clue/since you moved to your current element. Usually the first clue will direct you to the element in question, while the last clue will generally tell you either how the element is manipulated or where the codes are located on the box.The actual puzzles themselves are (relatively) short; the full game can be finished in about two hours with either judicious use of the hint system or familiarlity with other games of this general type.Get it if you're a fan of escape-the-room games and are okay with a short game. Avoid if you've got a low brightness screen or if you're not a fan of short games."

Although nothing happens that is ostensibly groundbreaking, you'll still want to have a decent rig in order to appreciate the silky machinations of the ever-changing puzzles. A smooth frameratedefinitelygoes a long way in suspending your disbelief. There is some pretty spiffy virtual engineering going on; experiencing these reconfigurations smoothly is much of the fun.The puzzles aren't incredibly difficult, but you may find yourself stuck simply because the textures are well made; you might not realize certain aspects of some puzzles can be manipulated. I'll be honest: at certain points my jaw dropped at what I was witnessing just after sliding something into place. This game is nothing if not labyrinthine.The story is extremely light yet it is very imperative to the experience. I was engaged enough to worry about the wellbeing of my character. Thankfully, there is a sequel available now. The next time it's on sale I'm certainly picking it up.Will I replay it now that I powered through it so quickly? Probably not.

They get bigger and more complicated as you solve more and more of the various mechanisms built into them.The gameplay involves a lot of rotating and twisting things, such as keys and dials, which can mean a lot of mouse movement. It also features an excellent hint system, which points you in the right direction without being too obvious if you haven't made progress in a little while.There's a small storyline that accompanies your journey, involving your relative and their research into something called the ""Null"" element. Though not the strongest narrative, it was enough to keep me pushing forward and make me want to jump right into the second game!The Room is fairly short, so I would recommend picking up the second one along with the first.

Ironically an independent studio made it, which just shows you how nontraditional this space is.From the title you might expectThe Roomto be a game where you are stuck in a room that you have to escape from. In fact it turns out to be the opposite. You are in a room with a safe that you have to figure out how to get into. Being a puzzle game, you find everything you need to get in somewhere on the safe itself. The game is divided into chapters: each time you open the container you find another inside that you must open. You start each chapter by inspecting the container to identify the points that you can interact with it. Many of these points will do nothing until you obtain some object (a key, a cog, a crank, etc) from another part of the container. All your interactions are intentionally tactile, making good use of the touch screen.The puzzles tend to do a good job of walking the fine line between being too hard and too easy. I was concerned at the beginning when it insisted on continuously giving me hints. It soon stopped and I realized that I was sorely unprepared for what I had gotten myself into. Most of the levels were quite enjoyable, giving just enough challenge to result in a satisfying “Aha!” moment. Even when if you get completely stuck, the game gives optional hints. There are usually a set of hints for a particular puzzle. They start general and vague and progress to being so specific that I never had to look online for an answer.The story is told through a series of notes left by the previous owner of the safe. They had been researching what they call the Null element, and the game soon takes on a creepy old-world mysticism vibe. In a lot of ways it reminds me ofAmnesia: the Dark Descent, though of course it is not a horror game. The story tropes, the tactile interactions with the world, and even the visuals all contribute to this feeling. The game was lauded when it came out for its visuals, and they still hold up for the most part. There were a few textures that I would have liked to be higher resolution, and a couple of times I was distracted by jagged edges on objects, but it wasn’t a chronic problem. Also if you get the PC edition this should be less of a problem as they touched up many of the textures.One of the important things in a mobile game is being able to pick it up for quick sessions and put it down at will.The Roommanages this by saving after every action, so you are free to leave and come back as often as you need to. I did not find it difficult to remember what I was in the middle of doing when returning to the game.If you have a choice of different devices to play on, go with the one with the largest screen. I played on my Nexus 5, and there were a few times I felt cramped and had to lean in close to inspect objects. The game is also quite dark, so you will have a hard time playing anywhere near sunlight.There are five chapters in the game (four at launch and an epilogue that was added to lead into the sequel). It was not an especially long game (took me a weekend of moderate playtime) but it was not nearly as short asMonument Valley."

Very reminiscent of ""escape rooms"" if you've ever done one of those in terms of the process of solving the layered puzzles.You'll look to get at most 3 hours out of this game, so please bear that in mind, but it's absolutely worth the purchase.My only ""negative"" is that you don't get much time before the game makes hints available, and even when you think you require a hint some of them are extremely obvious and not helpful. It would be better to simply play without them.Nevertheless the game is extremely well designed and immersive. Recommended."

There are hints, although I personally think it's better to turn them off. It can certainly all be done without them, although it needs some persistence. Then of course, one might easily overlook something - they can always be turned back on."

Most of the puzzle and puzzle chains are very linear, and there's little room for exploration. It's just trying to figure out which step you have to do next.In every single level, I felt like there was something missing. The chapter complete when there are still plenty of  unused visual objects left. The game forces you to move on, but all I was thinkng, ""hang on, there was still stuff I wanted to try."" But it doesn't let you go back. After playing through the game, I did go back with level select. It was just the exact same level. There's nothing else you can do.I wanted to look for hidden secrets. For clues about the story. For easter eggs. I looked up walkthroughs to see if I was just stupid for missing obvious things. I googled the plot.Finding out that it really is just a very simple, linear game was extremely disappointing."

It is a well crafted little game though, so the full 5 euros isn't bad either, same value as an entertaining movie I'd say.I guess it's a sort of episodic game, with The Room 2 continuing the short story and mystery, what did the alchemist and you in their footsteps uncover, and where did you end up.

Now, grant it I have a bit of a soft spot for puzzle sorts of games, but this game scratched an itch that few other games have managed to reach. While it can be at times a little bit frustrating, I find is kind of endearing that there are HINTS available without just absolutely giving away the answer. This as an option means that people are never so terribly stuck that they cannot piece the solution together with or without help.Now, after 2 hours of sitting around and playing with the puzzles I have explored everything this particular game h as to offer, and I have to say out of all the short games that I have purchased on Steam over the years, this one was more than worth the asking price, and I look forward to seeing more work from this develoer.

I've spent 3 or 4 times as much on other puzzle games and didn't enjoy them half as much as The Room.  Beautiful artwork, good audio, and well executed puzzles.  Not too easy and not too hard.  There is an in-game hint system, but I only used it once.  The story line is eh... but I was all about the puzzles.  Drop a few bucks and get ready to enjoy a couple hours of gametime.  Buy it.  Seriously."

Things seem pretty logical, with only the occassional leaps-of-logic or hints being required. For those of a nervous disposition like me (sadly I suffer from paranoia), this game has some eeriness to it, but no kind of jump scares or monsters, etc.There is no time limits (except for ONE puzzle and even so, it's very easy to do), no 'bad guys', so you can take your time on each level, even take long breaks if needed.The story is told in a basic way and was the only area I found lacking; it would have been nice to have had a richer story being told in conjuction with the game play, but it's a small gripe."

The atmosphere changes often allowing the player to always experience something new. The story is lacking a bit, especially since the story is not required to complete the game.  But overall, this is a very fun and entertaining game."

It has tight and compact level design so it has all of that puzzley goodness and none of the filler.But it does have a pretty interesting little story line, and the atmosphere is really well done (that dramatic lighting)."

You need to like puzzles and thinking about what to do next or you will dislike this game.I loved it.  It's a perfect game for someone looking for casual gaming sometimes.  You can play it , save and pick right up from where you left off. I look forwarded to starting The Room 2.P.S. Steam, where is The Room 3?"
