76561198025523136,Recommended,288260,18178311,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,Synesh,"A funny and yet compelling game base on the simple concept of flinking your ships to position rather just point and clicking your way towards the destination.The art style and humor of this game keeps is separated from the competition while the flicking mechanic makes it intriquing and compelling enough.Even though the campain can be challenging [God damn it Antonio!!!!] it dose a good job at introducing the players to the faction mechanics before dropping litterraly all that you have just learned towards the end.The gameplay by design is more focused on the micro management since you simply can not flick more then one ship at the time unless you use a Frigate, and even that is not exacly macro gameplay, you just attach your ships to one and shoot them into space in hope a vessel dosen't bump into a rando asteroid and blocks your entire ball.Even though the ships by them self have the same base stats, it's the skills that each one posses that can change the flow of the battle. For exemple I found that if the AI leaves the mothership alone for a good amount of time, taking a Greater Britan corvette with the shield on can cause as much damage as a well dispached torped, just distract them long enough for the bigger guns to move in.The physics are just the ice on the cake and good players will be able to make the best of it while also efficently using all the skills in your arsenal and constantly pouring out new ships to send to the frontline.Moving each ship can be, however, frustating or stressing simply because you have to aim each and every one of them in order to not screw your self by bumping your own troops into their doom.Not much to say on the options since it's a 2D game with a cartoon art style the only effective change to the quality is the screen resolution.Overall it's a fun game that I'd wish I could try in a deathmatch PvP game but right now the community seems too small as the game has passed under the Steam radar. Here one hopes it's actual relase date brings some much needed attention. Sad to say some skills or factions might end up not fully balanced because of the lack of PvP players to test it."

And yeah, the flick system is a little annoying and the fact you can't pause then issue commands and unpause makes the game a bit clunky, but imo it's not as bad as everyone makes it seem. Once you pick up the controls it evens out.Now for some other opinions, as previously mentioned the story and world are interesting but the singleplayer campaings seem more like extended tutorials for the 4 nations, with a small storyline for a character for each. Not that there's anything wrong with this, but the AI feels stuck on tutorial level difficulty the whole time. Although on a related note the 4 factions I just mentioned are actually pretty well balanced. I saw another review mention this but it's true. after playing through some games with different factions, none felt too powerful or too weak and with 4 factions that's real nice"

However where this game breaks down is in the gameplay. With units spread across a map and the requirement of micromanging single unit abilities through a crude interface in realtime, I found it more frustrating than anything.It becomes obvious that this was originally designed as a turn based game but then somewhere in the design process they decided to make it realtime. There is just too much to do in the small window of time you have, it seems too overwhelming.I actually liked the flicking mechanic and the physics elements, it's the rest of the game that takes away from the fun."

It is both bonkers and brilliant, as entertaining as it is unique. People who love to explore genre smashup are in for a treat. RTS and flicking seems counter-intuitive but Conflicks pulls it off brilliantly.The game is polished to perfection and slickly presented. Despite the absurdity of the setting, it actually offers compelling strategy and tactics. There are lots of diverse units and terrain with truly unique powers.Most games tread down all too familiar paths. Conflicks boldly blazes a trail into uncharted territory. The result is a smashing success, not is sales numbers, but is pure game design brilliance, excellence and innovation."

Nope. Nope nope nope.Play almost any other RTs instead."

It's also quite fun. The campaign is somewhat interesting, but as any RTS game, it's really no fun playing alone.You probably watched the steam promo video, where the guys were playing vs each other. And it seemed quite interesting, right? Well, playing vs other people online is possible, but as there's basically no one playing this game (according to the steam statistics, you can check them yourself if you don't believe me), you just can't find other players to play with.Also, I really don't see the point of having your ships' ingame abilities improved by grinding steam achievements. That's just plain idiotic.I hope the devs drop this game into some -90% discount so that there would be more players. That way this game could be insanely fun.If things change, I'll be glad to change this review."

,Recommended,288260,22283072,"Posted: 7 April, 2016",all,Markus,"Conflicks is one of the few games I have played in years that deserves adjectives like 'original' and 'fresh', if not 'innovative'.It's a hectic RTS at it's core, and you won't stand a chance without learning shortcuts, but there's a twist: you move your units by 'flicking' them across the map, which is a very interesting mechanic for a space setting. The game gains a surprising ammount of depth from it.The writing is great, the Humor and quality seen in the trailers is being kept up, the game absolutely is worth the 14.99 they ask, and personally - I'd buy it again for that.If you're up to a challenge, and feel like playing something original, go for it."

Artifice Studio, after creating Sang-Froid,  pulls of creating another mind-boggling genre hybrid, as fleet engagements are basically a giant game of Strategic snooker, or tactical péntanque, which is awesome.I'm not much for multiplayer, but as someone who loves the campaign portion of RTS, great atmosphere, novel mechanics and lovingly made products, I'd like to reccomend this game on those merits alone when you can get it for 10 quid or less.I had a wonderful time with the campaign. As you can tell from the intro, this is a strange beast in many ways, but the campaign's storyline is an honest and charming collection of 18th century tale telling. You've got your love-lorn British Privateer who will do anything to win the heart of his love, A Loyal French Female Musketeer looking for her father and a time traveling Spanish Monk who repeatedly tries to save his brother, while revolution is brooding. The drawings and artwork are fantastic and the voice acting cleverly replaced by striking sound effects. Love this game.Other than that, it has all the depth I need out of my RTS. There are no less then 4 different factions, each with a good variety of ships. Each of these ships have their own abilities. British ships can armor up, have blast weapons to knock enemy ships away. French ships are strong at area of effect abilities. The Spanish can warp and teleport both themselves and others around, while the Ottomans can clone and duplicate. There is great potential to stick to theme and come up with something interesting."

Metagame is lacking or not existing - or not presented in early game, if so, it's a shame.Bottom line is, this game mechanics does nothing for me and I don't know if there's anyone I could suggest this game to.Too much of innovation in one game?

,Not Recommended,288260,19648439,"Posted: 12 December, 2015",all,Sporkmonger,"Gameplay gets pretty tediously micromanage-y, and generally I ended up just building a few ships, tractoring them together with a frigate, and then just flicking the whole cluster at whatever I wanted to die. I'd stick one battleship in the mix and use that to build new ships at the destination as soon as it landed. That strategy is so effective that I basically just got bored and stopped being interested.That said, the constant misogyny in the game got old even faster than the gameplay. I mean, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's so bad I kept wondering if the misogyny might be trying to be a parody of medieval misogynistic attitudes, but it was so annoying either way that it didn't matter to me if it was misogyny or a parody of it. It was just irritating. I still don't get how a game about space chickens ended up being more about medieval attitudes towards women.Look, yes, the gameplay and art style is pretty original, I give the developers that, but I just didn't enjoy playing the game and ended up just deleting it after a couple hours of play time."

76561198046666118,Not Recommended,288260,17851394,"Posted: 2 September, 2015",all,CATTY&Co.,"Wanted to like this but the -creative- control mechanic isn't a -good- control mechanic. Flicking the ships around is slow, which would be tactical except they damage each other in real time and the computer is less slow so can sneak several ships up on you while you're trying to maneurve a harvester (sorry ""henship"") all the way across the map to the tiberium (sorry ""planet""). It's like trying to play subbuteo in boxing gloves. Every ship has a special ability - but I found it was pointless using any of them because they are as fiddly as the movement and the time taken to do it would be better spent manually pulling another ship out of the construction yard (sorry ""flagship""), or manually moving another ship another few inches toward whatever it was supposed to be doing. The special abilities are also the only distinguishing difference between the 4 factions, so the movement mechanic ends up limiting even that.If it had been turn-based a lot of the frustration wouldn't have arisen, but I guess they must have discarded that idea for some good reason or other. The humour deserves a mention - but the joke (alternative history with chicken powered space travel) wears thin quickly, and they fill several screens of text with it at the start and finish of each mission.I played about 6 missions and quit after spending an hour on a map only to then flick my mothership through a wormhole that just dumped it onto the side of a planet where it crashed. (Wormholes are random to make everything even more laborious.) I couldn't take any more after that.I'm not angry with it as a purchase or sorry I bought it, it was worth experimenting with. It's clearly been developed in a polished, professional way and they might well tweak and improve it somehow. Maybe it should be touchscreens-only. Maybe it should have a 4x grand strategy layer also controlled by ludicrous flicking. Maybe it would be more fun if you couldn't really tell where the ships were going to land. I don't know. It just isn't for me."
