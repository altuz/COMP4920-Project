I only did one quick recording to test it because while I was setting it up I realized this was not what I wanted. My own fault, should have checked out the product better but instead I assumed that the more expensive program would be better. Unlike the litecam game which records up to 100fps this program is limited to 30 fps. Thats right 30 fps. WHY! It may be ideal for some people just not what I was looking for. Picked it up on sale for 90% off so no big deal but it's still a let down."

Still looking for the mp3 option they advertise...- I also liked the program so much that I bought a 2nd copy for a friend, however, they use a MacBook and apparently is not compatible for this program."

,Recommended,288270,10731306,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,Farshad,"Works perfectly and effortlessly.  No crashes, no issues on my Windows 8.1 64bit dual screen machine.  It captures great from either monitor.Edit:  2 years later, I love this thing even more.  I use it to capture game stuff, web streaming video that I'd like to capture, as well as just audio/music (you can have it record off your mic, what's playing on your speakers, or what plays in your headset, etc).It basically captures anything playing or showing on your monitor.  You easily set the top/left/right/bottom edges and click record.  Recording just audio to aduio files is just as easy.This app is easily the #1 utility app that I use."
,Recommended,288270,12720623,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,Notawarrior,"Actually a really nice piece of software, and on the cheap side; grabbed it for $18.14 during a sale. Grabbed its game recording counter-part, and again, a really nice piece of software. A great variety of options and settings for each variable you could think of when it comes to recording a video. Videos come out smooth, and on sync. Though, I will admit, the videos are slightly darker than the live scene, but, this is something that is barely noticeable, 11 / 10 would recommend.Something to keep in mind, this is not a streaming-capable software. What it means by, ""Capture twitch.tv Live Stream,"" is just that. It can record someone's live stream; not actually perform a live stream."

This one works far better then most of them and is a fraction of the cost.It's easy to use and is fast at getting the captured data back to you so you can quickly edit it or post it to the net immediatly.Any users that are complaining about this software are either not using it correctly, they have poor machines, or they are just ignorant.For what this costs, versus what it does, it is a great product."

,Recommended,288270,10768976,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,five3,"Solid video capture software. Very simple and works for capturing audio/video of anything on your monitor. Not sure what the one reviewer is speaking of, in that he/she can't capture streaming content (liteCam HD captures both streaming & nonstreaming).If you're looking for easy to use point and click video/audio capture software, at $16.50 on sale or cheaper; I'd definately go with this.Note: Only seems to run when Steam is open."

,Not Recommended,288270,33488562,Posted: 12 July,all,batis,It is simple a desktop recorder with basic features. You can get this feature now as free from other recorders. This software now on should decrease it's price or add some extra features. Untill then I don't recommend it. And it is not related with Twitch or anything. It is just a selling tactic with word games.

No response yet.Well, at first everything worked. I was able to record my tutorials for a DAW (Music recording software/Digital Audio Workstation).However lately, it has been not so ""working"" and its been crashing every time I record more than a few minutes.I now have a completely brand new system... 8core AMD, R9 390 Nitro, 16gig DDR3, SSD and multiple HD's, built to process video as well as music. Win7 64/pro.There is absolutely no reason for litecan to hang. I get whitescreen when stopping my recording.So I'm really not happy with my purchase anymore.I'm currently looking for a better desktop recording software.This is not it. It fails, I wish it didn't.I've never given bad reviews before this... this is my first.Sorry guys, you havent fixed, can't recommend."
,Not Recommended,288270,17063454,"Posted: 15 July, 2015",all,Spegit,"Overall this software is at the very best: ""ok"". It will only capture in the resolution that you make the recording box, meaning that you can't have a 1080p recording unless you make the dimensions of the box. For thirty dollars, definitely not worth it. Don't waste your 30 bucks on this and instead buy Action"
