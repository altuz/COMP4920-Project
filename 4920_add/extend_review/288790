,Recommended,288790,18035267,"Posted: 14 September, 2015",all,Faudraline,"White Haven Mysterieswas the first HOG that I've played here on Steam, and also the first game that I've ever tried to review. Gosh, looking back to those couple of sentences that I scribbled and called as a review, I got embarrassed. I decided to run the game for a second time after a year - it's not that lengthy of a game anyhow - and write an appropriate review. I remember getting startled the first time that I've run the game, watching its eerie loading screen. I wondered if I've misread the description and bought myself a horror adventure instead of a HOG. Nope, this is a HOG nonetheless, and also a brief horror story.Our protagonist is a young woman who finds herself in front of an abandoned Asylum called White Haven at the middle of the night. That's about it, that's all we know about our ""Jane Doe"". She doesn't remember anything. A little girl greets us at the front gate and invites us in for the doctor who would know what to do. As we step into the old building, the girl flees away and leaves us with a somehow distorted reality. Suddenly, a creepy voice that belongs to a young man echoes, calling us ""his rats"". Creeped out yet? I know I was.Graphics and animations are fairly good within the genre. Background art works are cleverly designed to establish a unique atmosphere of ""something's quite not right"", and boy, do they manage to do so! The music is annoyingly creepy and background noises such as whispers, cackles and buzzing are always there to play you like a string. The atmosphere is the strongest feature of the game, creating the tension and thrill of the unknown successfully.HOG scenes are usually quite alright. Nothing is too hard to notice, and items are always clearly displayed. But there are certain phases of the game when our character becomes ""a bit off her head"", then even HOGs turn into nightmares. Those games, I wouldn't ask for my worst enemy! Puzzles and mini games are not often, but the ones that we encounter are quite good. There was one puzzle near the end of the game, asking for us to arrange moon's phases in order as observed from earth. Quite neat, huh? Oh, fair warning: there is no map to track but the game tells you when there is nothing left to solve in an area that you are standing in, so backtracking isn't much of an issue.I should say that I admire the effort put into making this game. It gives you a 3-4 hours of a HOG and a thrill that drives you insane alongside your main character. Does the ending worth it? Oh, I wouldn't know. It satisfied me enough, but I believe there would be people who'd call it a good story cut short. Maybe. We are used to unsatisfactory endings in this genre, so comparatively, it was great. Sadly, this is not the Collector's Edition, which would have a more complete story consistency, probably.It might be important to mention that the game hails from Gogii Games, and their games are always either A+ or a big F. There is no in between.White Haven Mysterieswas an A+ on effort, atmosphere, narration and HOG gameplay. Pick it on sale and have a few hours of HOG + psychosis thriller that you'd wish be longer.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

Buy on discount.The Good:Brilliant presentation of horror in a HOG, utilising atmospheric sounds and creepy animations very wellGreat voice-actingExtensive number of locations & hidden objects that are well-drawnHidden objects were well-placed and give a decent challengeGame inventory use is largely intuitive and make logical senseThe Bad:Puzzles were rare and pretty easyShort in gaming length: Finished in 2 hours on normal modeFacial animations of characters in cutscenes were overdrawn and distractingSounds can be very repetitive and irritatingThe Ugly:Had a fantastic concept of hallucinations that changed the perspective of environment, which was only used twice in whole gameStory ending was abrupt and unsatisfyingOptions were limited: Normal/Expert mode with increased hint time the only difference in difficultyNo bonus content: No achievements, no cards, no epilogue, concept artTied with the previous point: Absolutely no replayabilityFor people who know their HOG's:This game has the barebones expected of a HOG; you get a vague story, lots of hidden objects to find and work your way through. The biggest problem with this one was it really had the potential to stick out as unique HOG (even without the expected bonus features you get with HOG's on Steam), in that it really drew into the horror/thriller world. The whole game was dedicated to scaring you and keep you guessing to the end. Unfortunately it doesn't keep the momentum going and the ending ends up being a plot hole on its own. Another missed opportunity, is the feature of hallucinations which really tied into the story but again never panned out. Solving puzzles to change the environment to 'reality' was really entrancing, but the game only used it twice (the second being only half-completed). This, with no replayability, is why I recommend the game, but only when its on sale.For people who are new/casual to HOG's (Hidden Object Games):This is a game where you tramp around a massive property, finding items to help you as you work your way through the story and the locations. It has sections where you have to find everything on a list (hidden-objects) or have to solve puzzles to proceed.This HOG is one of the better ones I've seen, because it incorporated horror and thill so well, whilst many other games in the genre often skimp on. The hidden objects in the game are challenging but not frustrating and same could be said for the few puzzles you do find. Unfortunately, it has none of the bonus features that are now becoming standard on Steam, including trading cards and an epilogue. This game is an excellent example for a casual player and I recommend it."

The game suffers from an extremely low production values, with most of its sound effects and music being stock, royalty-free sounds and music downloaded from the Internet, rather cringe-worthy animation, average art style, extremely simple puzzles, rather non-sensical storyline, very bad technical problems (the game didn't support the native resolution of my monitor, so I had to play it on a laptop) and an extremely short length (it only took me 2 hours to beat this). I bought it for about a dollar from a sale, and it was the first modern hidden object game that I ever played, so I don't regret my purchase too much. But, all things considered, I really can't recommend it to anybody."

However, this abandoned facility is creepy. And what's with antidote?In other words, White Haven Mysteries has everything for me to enjoy: dark plot, mysterious places and a constant question of why you? However, the game is giving away quickly the twist of the story... But still, it was exciting to know more. And unfortunately, well, I'm still confused about many elements.The gameplay is standard: find items, clear hidden objects, solve puzzles, etc.. The hidden objects scenes are quite a thing: big list, items well hidden or partially visible, etc.. The puzzles were quite easy. I didn't really need to use the skip button. However, sometimes, it wasn't easy to find your way through. But each area cleared is tagged as such, so, you know where to go ultimately.The graphics are good and the soundtrack is really giving you creepy feelings. I understand that the game is aimed more towards horror and moments to jump on your chair, however, it's soft.Apart the fact that on Win 8.1, I have to close Steam through the task manager because once White Haven closed, it's still giving a signal that I'm still in the game, White Haven Mysteries is really a decent HO games. I just wish that the plot makes more sense (in the end, I still don't know what I was doing there, who brought me here, if there is any real person behind, etc..). Anyway, I'm still recommending the game."

With some additional riddles, it has some nice artworks and a creepy story about... well Amnesia. You have to find out what has happened to you, a long time ago, and you have to face the ghosts of the protagonists past, or better said the echoes.Though the game is not the worst HOG there are some things about it that are in fact annoying. And no this game wasn't the CE... Furthermore it still has some gamebreaking glitches, I had luck that I encountered one after taking a break and closing the game after 20 Minutes of actual play...

The storyline was meh if you could even call it a storyline, I don't expect it to be best seller writers telling the story but I do expect it to at least interest me. The puzzles were completely nonsensical most of the time; never used hint as much as I have in this game in any others I have played, literally no way to even guess what they wanted you to accomplish bar spamming hint and trying out all your items. I also encountered a bug where I was able to bypass an hour or so of the game which I must say I am not complaining about. The warning sign as you load up set it up so that everyone who played it would be disappointed, I don't think I even noticed it being eerie at all. Worst of all is that you could completely just spam click the hidden item sections and finish them, in fact it was generally faster to do that than to search for items that blended into the background so well that they actually were part of the scenery and the only way to see them is with hints, not good."

However, I played it through in one sitting and if you're willing to or want to use this for a single-evening playthrough, as I did, it is absolutely worth it.  The puzzles are simple enough to work through that it doesn't really require more than about 2-3 hours to finish (depending on your speed and whatnot).The game does an excellent job with atmosphere and creepiness, sound and ambiance really adds to the setting, and voiceover work is quite well done (better than many HO games can boast).  The HO scenes are well done, with objects that can be distinguished from one another and nice clear scenes.  Puzzles, as I mentioned, are relatively simple but not so much that I felt like it was made for precocious kindergarteners.The story is interesting, if not 100% original (but what story is nowadays?), and piecing together information via news clippings and journals helps keep the information trickling in as you go rather than spoon-feeding you chunks of information.  The end wasn't entirely unexpected but I felt like it was done well.  A few reviewers thought it could be confusing but it really shouldn't be, especially if you paid attention and read your news clippings as you got them.At $4.99, it's priced reasonably for its length, and even better if you can grab it on sale.  I feel like it's totally worth it, even knowing you might have to plow through it in one shot if the save issue hasn't been patched.  It kept me interested enough that I didn't even notice how long I'd been playing it."

The HO scenes are clear, and the objects are big enough to be spotted.# It's quite short. It took me just 2 hours to finish it, and I read every journal entry and didn't skip a single puzzle.# The story is nothing new. A spooky building, a mystery to solve, a mad scientist - standard stuff.

I would say that I wish I had, but since the game was on sale for less than a dollar, all I really lost was my time.The game play is good at first for an HO game, but as you progress things get more and more time consuming. Each task seems to take longer to complete than the last. I would have stopped playing because I was getting bored and irritated, but I was very curious to see how the story line would end. Like the game play, the story line was good at first. It drew you in and made you curious. As the game went on it remained okay, when you were able to get somewhere instead spending all your time on puzzles so you could get an object for another puzzle that is. Sadly though at the end of the game it all went downhill. It was like the ending was thrown together in rush. You were left with more questions and basically no answers for the ones you already had. The ending didn't fully make sense either, though I won't spoil it by saying more for those that choose to buy this game.Personally I'm half and half on this game. It could've been both better and worse.
