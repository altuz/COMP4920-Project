However, it's also extremely short. When the game ended, I just sat there dumbfounded. I couldn't believe the game was over already and the story seemed incomplete - there were questions that never got answered. So I looked up the walkthrough on Gamezebo to see if I had missed anything. It turns out that there is a ""collector's edition"" with more to the story. So I DO recommend this game. But don't buy it on Steam. Buy it elsewhere and make sure it's the Collector's Edition. If you're a hidden object fan, you'll love this game."
,Not Recommended,288840,12423375,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,BridgetFisher,"This is an odd mystery game maybe better avoided than enjoyed by anyone and very very very short.  The game is short and all puzzles can be skipped with hint buttons if stuck somewhere.  Adjustable difficulty is nice but its the way the game is designed that is the weak point.  Many of the hidden object puzzles have a colored filter over the entire screen making everything seem white, blue, or black.  This is very straining to try and enjoy veteran players will find, while casual players spamming the hint button will probably just turn it off.The story is good not that it matters this is a game, and the gameplay is where it breaks down.  There is an interesting mechanic used of switching from the present to the ghostly past where you can move items from the past to the present.  This is very interesting, would be nice to see some sort of mechanic like that used in future games.  Doesnt feel very ghosty overall, not to spooky which is a downer for october scary gaming :(Rating:  4/10  Value:  $1.99$"
,Recommended,288840,23723635,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"You inherited a mansion but once there, everything is in disarray and dark. When you realize that ghosts are haunting it, you meet the woman that was killed... your mother. An evil is lurking around and your only way to beat it is to use your gift of walking between the ghost and the living realms....Haunted Past: Realm of Ghosts is one of these games in my backlog that I decided to play after stumbling upon it on Big Fish games, when I was adding to Neoseeker the series Haunted Manor. Haunted Past was the game just under. When I realized that I had it in my library, I told myself why not?So far, I liked the plot. I also liked the twist in the game. Sure, it's not the plot of the year. But at least, you're not discovering the truth early on.The gameplay is the standard one: find items, use them, clear hidden objects scenes and solve puzzles. However, here, you have a special feature: the ghost realm. Indeed, through mirrors, you can access the same room but in another realm and in its previous state. Items found there can't be brought back with you to the real world, so you have to hid them in the ghost room and to find them in the real world. While it's true that these areas are cleared fairly quick, it's still a nice way to influence the world (example: a cushion was put in the real room but in the ghost realm, it's not there. So you use your brain to make one with the items hidden in it... and tadaaa, the cushion in the real world will have them!). Also, to help you, each time a room is totally cleared, a message is shown. And last but not least, some doors are closed because of evil magic/spirit. They can be opened by doing the right glyph you'll find around...Everything is easy, apart for same areas that you can't really see. It might have been influenced by the weather here, as it was a little sunny and that I had to move my screen to find a correct angle (as I'm playing hidden objects games on my laptop mainly).The graphics are quite good, very darker in the real world, as the estate is abandoned but when you go to the ghost realm, it's very bright. The soundtrack is also good.In other words, for 5 bucks, you have a good little casual adventure game, with a good plot, good graphics and interesting features. It would be sad for you to miss it. Go for it, whether it's full price or discounted."

This game indeed scratches that itch. Very casual; extremely linear and the hidden object areas are good but not too difficult or clever. Where this game fails is in the so called puzzles. They are extremely simple and the developers failed so far offering no mini-games with these. Where the game gets it right is presentation. Good atmosphere, the graphics & sound/music are good for it's genre.I believe that casual players and gamers like myself who are looking for a change of pace will enjoy this game. However aficionados of this type of game will probably find it lacking. Only once did I even consider using the hint button to find a hidden object and a few times I found myself wishing the hidden object portions where either longer or more difficult; this on the so called advanced setting."

Hopefully they'll make another."
76561198006029492,Recommended,288840,9829321,"Posted: 15 April, 2014",all,Krozair,Short but sweet.  It took a little over 4 hours to complete.  The puzzles are fairly fun and the hidden object parts are decent.  I was hoping for something more challenging but for five bucks I really can't complain.  I literally ran through this one but I have recently finished a much harder game and that is probably why this one went so fast.  The story is disjointed and such but the visuals are really nice.  The music is decent and the atmosphere works well.  This is a perfect game if you are bored and your finger needs to click for a few hours.
76561198064540185,Recommended,288840,13191168,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,solia_o,It's an ok game. I loved the settings and the transition between the past and present same outline but different details. However the reason for summoning the evil spirit lacked conviction -loyalty by servants?! really now. Anyway I would recommend it if you like HO and if it's on sale.
76561198117791534,Not Recommended,288840,14191757,"Posted: 27 January, 2015",all,Kharmakazi,"It was an OK game.  It was VERY short, though (only 2.5 hours for me to finish it).  The story line has potential, but they didn't really flesh out the details much, which could done a lot for the game and made it a little longer.Spoiler: at the very least, they could have told us how the first wife died and why she's evil.  Is she just ticked off being brought back form the dead, or is she jealous that he got remarried AND they had a kid? And, why the hell would her servants, loyal though they may have been, want to bring her back?  Was he an evil guy?  Doesn't seem so from his notes.  And, where did they learn to use black magic from?  Blah, blah blah.  Lots of holes... Any way, if you get this super cheap like I did, it's a good distraction for a few hours, but I can't recommend paying full price for it..."

Beautiful graphics, eerie atmosphere.Although the plot is a common theme amongst hidden object games, the story is rich and keeps the player interested.7/10 because it has that typical HoG ending that leaves off feeling rather unfinished."

There are only a few puzzle parts and they are pretty simple, plus the hidden object scenes have distinct objects, so nothing frustrating."

Story made some degree of sense and having to move between times to solve puzzles added considerable variety. Ending didn't quite make sense but all in all a very enjoyable 2 hours.

,Recommended,288840,16032920,"Posted: 27 May, 2015",all,Coreplant,"Haunted Past: Realm of Ghosts - a solid game, enjoyable, with a robust hint system and a fairly straightforward and nicely laid out pathway. If I had to quibble, it's the length of the game and lack of variety to the extra puzzles. In that there were no extra puzzles. Top notch graphics, a storyline I didn't see every twist before it happened, and overall a fun hour to spend."

However, the one downside of this game would have to be how short it is. My frist time playing it I beat the game in about 3 or 4 hours at max. I wouldn't pay full price for it but if you can catch it on sale then I would get it."

,Recommended,288840,16088593,"Posted: 30 May, 2015",all,shiaakuma,"This isn't a bad little game if you can get it on sale, as the roughly two hours of playtime is a little scanty.Graphics are pretty, music/sound effective, and voice acting tolerable.The weakest point other than length is a profound lack of plot, or maybe I should say lack of backstory or detail in the plot.  Now, I don't generally expect HO games to be brimming over with complex plot, but there are many out there that have taken time to at least flesh things out, which this didn't do well.The other thing I will mention is that in order to play fullscreen on Windows 8 with a 4k monitor, I did have to go into the executable and disable display scaling; this is the only way I've found to get the game to scale properly.  Just FYI if you are running a newer display.So if you want a short and simple HO puzzle and don't care too much about deep plot, go ahead and grab this one if you can find it on sale.  I do not recommend full price for what you get."

The storyline seemed to end ubruptly, leaving me wondering where the rest of the story is. This is basically a good time killer for people who like point and click hidden object games. I wouldn't pay more than $1.99 for it though."

Its atmosphere is unique, engaging, and held my attention from start to finish. There's roughly 1 - 2 hours of gameplay depending on a person's playstyle and game difficulty, which is customizable. The story, voice acting, and puzzles were all above average compared to other hidden object games I have experienced. I definitely recommend this game."
