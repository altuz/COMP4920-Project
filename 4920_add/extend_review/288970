The game is not particularly difficult and as I mentioned, it is quite short.  The plot isn't spectacular, which doesn't bother me too much personally but might be a turn-off for people used to the story quality of more recent AM games.  The voiceover work is cringeworthy but blessedly limited to a few cutscenes and some dialogue at the beginning.  Graphically it's not great but I've seen far worse, so I thought it was fine overall.So overall, not a spectacular addition to the HO/puzzle genre, but not actually that bad either.  I picked it up on sale for 75% off (making it only a little over a dollar) and don't feel at all regretful, but I wouldn't have liked to pay a full $4.99 for what I got."

The detective story is decent and the items and puzzles are surprisingly meaningful.However, there are too many downsides:Very bad graphics and lack of animations. It looks like a game from 2001.It's very short, I've finished it in about two and half hours.There are way too many hidden-object scenes.The ""helmet placement"" puzzle is broken and can't be solved. Skip button saves the day."

We want the button, and we want it now. Now. I don't want to give this game a negative, because it doesn't deserve it. On the other way, I can't recommend it with confidence because there are glitches. A neutral button would be fine here.Dark Lore Mysteries is an Artifex-style HOG. You are a detective who need to solve a murder. Unfortunately, you'll discover that the villian is not an ordinary man but an evil being (surprise!). Through the gameplay you will find lots of hidden object scenes. Most of them are good enough, but you will need to push the hint button for a few times. The story is cheesy but at some point, even the best Artifex HOGs are cheesy. The graphics are meh. Not so bad, but outdated. The puzzles are limited and very easy. There should be better puzze scenes. 6/10."
,Not Recommended,288970,17705046,"Posted: 25 August, 2015",all,Kimchi Tea,"TL;DR: don't recommend the game; do recommend that some graphic designers be sacked.After playing for about an hour, I was going to give this a positive review. Seemed like a pretty typical hidden object game, nothing spectaculor, but it had well-designed hidden object scenes, a good ratio of hidden object scenes to puzzles, and a customizable difficulty setting -- which is a big plus in my book.Unfortunately, as I continued playing, the hidden object scenes started getting sloppy:someobvious white outlineswhere objects hadn't been properly cut outpoorly skewed/resized imagesmore objects that didn't fit in the time period or aestheticthe same object images being repeated in multiple scenesmultiple objects that fit the given description, but the game only accepted one of themThere's also some of the usual flaws of the hidden object genre -- like when you come across the murderer while he's trying to kill someone, and he just stands around waiting while you go back to mess around with puzzles trying to find the object you need to stop him, because HOG developers somehow can't accept that this is not a genre where you can create a sense of real-time urgency -- and an overall weak plot. I don't mind that so much, but the lazy hidden object scenes in the second half of the game are a  dealbreaker."

My character drew a conclusion about who was guilty and I barely even knew who the person was.The HOG part was fine, standard. I found sometimes the items I clicked on wouldn't register.The puzzles were pretty typical, although some were buggy. There is one puzzle where you have to draw lines between a peg and a hole using the mouse and it would constantly reset for unknown reasons as soon as I got close to the end. Very frustrating.There are definitely much better games available."

It started out good, loved the atmosphere the settings and background music not to mention an intriguing mystery. However, somehow it got repetitive and the story unfolded in an unorganized and rushed manner. I'll give it a yes as to give you a chance to judge yourself. If it's on sale get it's a short one and you might like it."
76561198071990484,Recommended,288970,30800701,Posted: 28 March,all,DJ Eski,"Hard to recommend this properly, it has a plentiful supply of HO scenes which are easy to complete. The storyline is merely average fare and the puzzles are again easy to complete. Sometimes it is not always obvious which items should be used within the scene and a little ""trial and errror"" would be involved with no actual idea why it worked.I would suggest to purchase with a large discount applied and expect around 2-3 hours maximum to completion.Overall I score it a ""Yes"" marginally."

Or requesting a hint, which works fairly well."
,Recommended,288970,23387100,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,osirish,"Dark Lore Mysteries: The Hunt For Truth is a solid effort in the HOG genre. It doesn't do anything particularly well or unique, but it doesn't do anything badly either. The voice acting, graphics, and sound are all average to above average, the story is a familiar one with a slight twist at the end.There's very little negative to say about the game, other than the fact that there are a lot of HO scenes, bordering on too many, and not enough puzzles, and one of the HO scenes was annoying due to the fact you were asked to find a ""flower"" in the scene, when the scene contained multiple flowers, and you had to keep clicking until you found the one it wanted.A short game with a abrupt (rushed?) ending, but overall worth picking up if you like HOGs."
76561198046065881,Recommended,288970,29841751,Posted: 11 February,all,Crux,"I've played quite a few of this sort of P&C/HOG and I'd rate this one overall, about average. I thought the story, VO, and graphics were decent and enjoyed the hidden object puzzles' art and found their difficulty slightly above average. And although the mini games weren't particularly challenging (and did include many of the same ones you find in all these types of games), there were a few unique ones I haden't seen before.One thing this game does better than most, is to allows the user to customize the individual difficulty settings. So in addition to being able to select the standard, predefined 'Casual' and 'Advanced' settings, they also included a 'Custom' setting that gives the user the option to individually select the following:Tutorial - On / OffVisual Help - On / OffIn-Game Tips - On / OffHidden Object Difficulty - Casual / AdvancedHint Recharge - Fast / Medium / SlowSolve Puzzle Charge - Short / Long / OffHow cool is that? I wish all these types of games had that degree of difficulty configuration.I'm not saying this game is a must-play, but I enjoyed it enough to give it a recommend. I bought it on sale for $1.24 and have no regrets.Also, the game played well for me on Linux Mint 18 (Wine/PlayOnLinux). The one minor issue I experienced was that once I had initially configured the game to display in Fullscreen in the game's Options, the first time I'd click Play in a given session, it would start in window mode. I would then have to exit via the game's Menu and hit Play again to get it to play as expected in borderless fullscreen. Other than that, I experience no issues.PS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review. So Steam only shows that I played 0.5 hrs as of the time of this review, although I've played at least 3 hrs and have completed the game.Update: Added 'difficulty settings' portion."

It was a pleasant enough game, the storyline seemed a bit shaky but the hidden object scenes and puzzles were of decent quality. I had a few tiny bugs of the game not registering when clicking on objects but otherwise I had no problems. If you are able to find this game on sale, I recommend it. Happy gaming!"

The story could of been longer and a little more refined, but still good fun.In a city of Pennsylvania, a Magistrate is murdered in a suspected way.

,Not Recommended,288970,29508007,Posted: 26 January,all,maxcorps,"I'm going to say no to this one. Lots of Hidden object scenes. Interesting spread of puzzles. But honestly half this game doesn't really make intuative sense. Like why would I normally put this object here and then do what with it? It's odd, even for me. Some of it is good but the rest counter acts it. Story is .... odd? Ending is Eh. Oh theres no cards for this or achievments so the best way to do the Hidden object scenes is to click like a madman. I will say they put a ton of crap in the scenes. If you get this on a deep discount buy it but it's honestly not worth the 5 bucks."

It's mostly just one hidden object scene after another, which would be all right except that the artwork just isn't very good. What little story it has is bland and confusing. I am tempted to give it a marginal thumbs up simply because it's cheap and functional, but on the other hand there are so many better games out there that it's hard to justify spending any time on this one."

But, it soon devolved into sloppy, too easy, and then a few wtf puzzle designs. The peg one is really bugged. No real storyline, either, and I soon just got bored with this game.  I can't honestly recommend unless you have time to just kill and it's on a 90% off sale."
