The hand mechanics are terrible.  The objects are nearly impossible to grasp, and the dropping seemed really poor too (for example, I was finally able to grab a teabag and had it perfectly hovered over my cup.  When I went to drop the bag, the hand decided to fling it instead of just letting go of it).Until the devs clean up the mechanics, I'm going to have to give this a thumbs-down."

You'll get an hour or two of fun out of it and it's even more fun if you get someone else to play and watch them make the same hillarious mistakes you did. Ampu-Tea is easier to get into than Surgeon Simulator and appeals to a different audience, this is definitely a more casual version of the precise control genre--in some ways it almost feels like a short parody of Surgeon Simulator.Your goal is to make a cup of tea to order, as it appears on a randomly generated instruction card. Sometimes you will also need to add sugar, a certain amount of water or milk will be needed, and other times you will need to avoid certain ingredients.Some of the achievements are fun to get as well. I enjoyed clearing everything off and flipping over the table the most. The launch the game 500 times achievement is definitely meant as a joke.The music is okay, there is only one short track to speak of. Sound effects get the job done but aren't memorable in any way.

Yes, its that hard aswell, but surgeon simulator more player friendly, more playable and include more content.There is one goal in Ampu-Tea: yes, to make a cup of tea. Sounds easy right? yes it is IRL. If it would be this hard to create a cup of tea irl then the brittish empire would have never interested in colonizing/conquerion indian ocean region including India.The engine is bad, buggy and some of the achievements are annoying. Also, its way too expensive for the content and gameplay it offers, i believe review would be still negative if it would be 0,99 tho.As your Average Achievement Hunter ill share some informations about achievements:11 steam achievements and most of them annoying. i mean, most of them awarded for creating a cup of tea, some of the awarded to trying to create but in wrong order, but the point of the start the game 500 times is just stupid.

Where should I start? These are some of the worst controls I've ever experienced in a game. I'm not even kidding when I say I've spent about 15 minutes trying to grab a cup to even start the tea making process. Yeah, I know for sure that this is the humorous nature of the game, but it shouldn't be this difficult, and hell, it just becomes annoying and not even slightly challenging. I couldn't feel anything else but disappointment while playing this, it's just not what I was expecting. Graphically, it does look bad too, even on the highest settings. Also, all the meme references shoved in your face feel downright unfunny.

Its a basic concept, but the game turns this concept into a challange.

Want to grab a cup, all the others get pushed off the table and onto the floor. Although over time it does go away as you learn the controls.+Sound/Music isnt bad.Sure the music can get annoying after a bit but the sounds go with the art style.Cons-Not to much to do.The concept of the game is to make tea, and thats all you do. It gets old after a while.-Annoying controls.The controls take a while to get used to, and by defealt they are annoying and difficult to use.Final OpinionAmpu-Teais a fun game that can occupy a few hours of time. Its a basic puzzle/physics game (in my mind du to difficulty) that is only somewhat worth the price. For the current $5 it costs, I would only reccomend it if you have spare change and dont mind a challange. But ifApmu-Teais on sale, get it. The game is deffinatly something that can liven up your steam library, and as i've said before, can occupy a few hours of time."

,Not Recommended,289090,24396077,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,Kintha,My Ampu-tea ReviewWhat is Ampu-tea?Ampu-tea is a tea making simulator in which the player uses a robotic arm(hence the games pun on words title.) the keyboard/mouse to control the hand/fingers in a similar fashion seen in surgeon simulator and games with similar control schemes. Unlike surgeon simulator which has plenty of content and scenarios in which you can play on there is only 1 scenario given and it is very basic(making a cup of tea in a kitchen.) there is no other content avaliable after you complete the title.Is This Game Fun?I personally didn't think that the game is that fun and the novelty wears off very quickly this game is probably just for people to mess around on for making youtube videos etc.How Long Is This Game?This game can be completed within 1 or 2 hours however to get the final achievement(loading the game 500 times.) it will take you 6.7 hours to complete.Who Would I Recommend This For?Being personally honest I wouldn't recommend this game at all even at the sale price because there are better games avaliable at the same price such as yet another zombie defence and orion prelude both of which are significantly better and longer than this game. The only time you should even think about playing this game is if someone on your steam friends list gives you this as a joke present.

I even have Day one Garry's Incident and that game was more playable than this piece of trash. The camera angle is so awkward and bad, It needs to be a first person perspective, not a sideview of a robot arm. I wasted so much time trying to grab stuff with the awful robot hand, only to constantly knock everything over when i grab it or break the robot hand. It has a bunch of terrible memes in it to like *Epic Fail* which describes this game just fine.

Environment looks nice.CONS:Amputees struggling in rehabilitation may not be the most tasteful punchline a game could be based off of. More importantly however, the game controls awfully. One might say it was meant to be this way, however games like Octodad and Surgeon Simulator control well... Just clunky to the point of humor. Movement in Ampu-Tea however, is sluggish and often unresponsive. Reeling in fingers to grip is so slow that your fingers will push the item out of grasp. Items will also stick to the hand. Physics move the room about even if you're afk. Sometimes you're notified when you fail immediately, sometimes it waits to notify you at the very end.WORTH:This game may stave off boredom for 15 minutes or so, but is not worth full-price by a long-shot. At the time of writing this, it is on sale for 0.74USD, which is fair for a game that honestly doesn't work very well.OVERALL:The nail in the coffin that keeps this from being the average quick n easy achievement game is the ludicrous achievement requesting you open the program 400 times. I wouldn't recommend this.SCORE:3/10Full Review Coming Soon"

,Not Recommended,289090,23414778,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,JacquesLeSauve,"Clearly inspired by 2013'sSurgeon Simulator 2013(which the developer at least have the decency to acknowledge), this game has the quirkiness and tongue-in-cheek playfulness of that title, but with none of the personality, finese or fun. Robotic limbs are pretty damn bad*ss (one day I really hope we'll see some robotic *sses, too! Maybe I'll even get one myself if I'm real lucky), and I guess tea is pretty decent as well, but here, they really don't blend very well at all.Controlling the robotic arm of a recovering amputee (because they're classy with their set-up like that), you must fulfill the order required to make a satisfactory cup of tea and try your best not to completely wreck the gaff in the process. The arm itself is somewhat unwieldy and very unintuitive to direct, with the motions of the fingers being a particular bugbear. In Surgeon Simulator the controls were laid out in a way that made sense and soon felt pretty natural to use, and the solid, slightly stubby fingers meant picking up items was mostly quick and straightforward. Here, however, an awkward control scheme mixed with long, gangly, slow-moving digits that don't even close properly makes for the majority of the challenge as you struggle massively with picking up anything and wrestling with pretty much every single object you try to interact with.There isn't really much more to the game other than grabbing a cup, putting some items into it, moving the cup around, adding some liquids then placing the cup on a platter. And after you've done that once, you've essentially seen all the game has to offer. You can always smash everything up or flip the table (possibly breaking the arm as you do), but other than that, nada. Depending on how quickly the controls click with you or how lucky you get, you could probably finish this in anything from 10 to 40 minutes (I think I completed every achievement bar one in half an hour), and after that you've no real reason to revisit it since there's nothing else on offer except to retry the task with slightly different orders or quantities of ingredients.More frustrating and annoying than bad, given how little content there is here, and how not particularly fun it is, there's no way I could recommend it at full price, and, if anything, fives euros seems like a bit of a p*ss take if you ask me. If controlling the thing wasn't so unneccesarily cumbersome, or there was more content beyond a single ""quest"" to complete, I'd likely endorse it, but as it stands, it's probably worth something closer to 50c. Though there could be an argument made for it being free. If it's on sale and you justhaveto see what the fuss is about, maybe it's worth briefly investigating. But in any other circumstances, there's really so many other, better things you could be wasting your time and money on than this."

The premise seems like great fun. But the harsh reality is, this game belongs in the trash.As soon as you launch, you're greeted by a nice splash screen with the controls, and a diagram of the robotic hand. That's very nice, and all. I approve of that.On closer inspection, the controls are about as ergonomic as one of those cheap silicone keyboards. F1 to F5 are various menu things, like restarting the game, and changing difficulty. I'm not particularly fond of this, as using QWER for the hand doesn't make much sense, when Surgeon Sim is more ergonomic, and makes more sense.Difficulty is changed simply by adding one more step to making your tea, which makes sense. I can't complain there.The graphics feel cheap, and misplaced. Some are fantastic, some are blurry, and look like they're in low-res.I'll also like to note that the noises your hand makes are so annoying, I just up and muted the game from volume mixer.Additionally, I'd like to note that I grabbed a cup, and my hand clipped through the mug, threw it into the air, and my hand continued to spin for 10 minutes, until it fell off.19/10.

Not only do you have to aim with the arm, but you are limited on movement. If you are adjusting height, your hand is stuck in that position as you adjust, vertically you can not move horizontally or forwards/backwards. If they just copied and pasted the controls from the sergon game, it would be a fun game.Also when you finally got your fingers around the cup handle, the game is so badly designed that your fingers clip through the handle if you jerk the mouse too fast.

It is infuriating when all of a sudden the cup slips or randomly falls meaning you need to spend twenty minutes putting upright again.One positive about it is that, being English, this was an excellent test at how 'English' I am, I can now make cups of Tea in real life and in the poorly made virtual world, so any Englishmen who fancy a challenge might want to pick this up just to confirm your Tea making abilities.

Just when you think that you've mastered the game you'll run into a bug that ruins your cup of tea. Everything weights the same, so everything flies upon contact. Unconfortable controls makes it impossible to grab things since your hand is so slow that the thing you're trying to grab moves as you're grabbing. You can't play offline, even if you have the game installed on your PC, which is the reason to why we install most games. The help screen keeps popping up when you restart, which is annoying and the game feels unfinished, considering the fact that you can go outside the kitchen, there's no real menu or even credits/ending. On the bright side, it was a funny experience at first and the references are kinda funny since they describe the opposite of what you're actually doing. The concept is also funny (just not done right) and you can tableflip. You also get Steam cards, which you can sell and get the value of the game back. You can also troll your friends by letting them try and laugh as they rage.Pros:- Fun first time experience- Funny concept- You can tableflip- Cool references- Steam Cards- Good for trolling friendsCons:- Disgusting, uncustomisable controls- You can't launch the game without internet- Buggy hand that sometimes has its own will- Everything has the same weight- Slow and weak hand that never grips- Annoying help screen that shows up all the time- Feels unfinished2/10 - Worth 0.74€ I guess.

The controls don't feel like you are controlling a robotic arm, more like a broken drop claw game. Items are not coded correctly to be grab-able, instead fingers on arm clip through most everything and there isn't any ""grip"" to the hand. The objective is obviously to make tea, but there are items on the table that have an unclear function in the tea making process (black candy bits?). It has promise if the gameplay is fixed, mostly fixing the robotic arm to actually feel like a hand. The gameplay is so broken it isn't worth the purchase as is without major updates, even as a time waster."

Multiple times while grabbing or holding items, they would go through the solid portion of the robotic hand, or through other solid objects - attempting to grab tea cups that would then push through the back of the precariously positioned tea rack instead of knocking the rack over, bags of tea being in hand one moment and shooting up through the top of the hand the next, etc. At one point while playing, after 'pressing' the hot water button several times with no response, the water began to suddenly pop out (I would guess a 20 second or so lapse). I was tabbed out of the game in windowed mode while this was happening, and watched the hot water jug topple backwards. The hand was stationary well away from the table itself, panned out enough to see the table in its entirety while this was going on. All in all, the game could have some potential if it were polished and these errors were fixed. Unless those aren't errors and they are included purposely to make the game more 'challenging', in which case, that's poor judgment and a lack of creativity on part of the designers. Maybe if there's a patch I'd consider continuing to play, but as of now, I'd say I wasted my money and time."

It would be alright except for the fact that if something says ""No sugar"" or anything to that effect about skipping a step with your teamaking, the game has no way of detecting 0 so it remains stuck on that step and you can't move on. If it asks for 1 sugar and you put a cube of sugar in the cup before adding a teabag and water, then the game will not progress at the sugar stage. If you try to put it another sugar cube at that point though, it'll fial you for adding too much sugar. I successfully managed to make it to the milk stage and got no feedback on what ""a dash of milk"" was until the 8th glob of milk goes in and I lose because that's too much milk, even though globs 1-7 did nothing to trigger moving on to the next step.These bugs make the game almost impossible to complete unless you reset over and over until you get a mode that has you performing at least one of each item in order and somehow having it properly detect what you're doing.This game should be early access, not a full sale.

But since there's not I guess I can't recommend this game. All of this game's enjoyment is out of the frustration and the OH SO WONKY physics engine. In the story you're an amputee who lost his ""arm""He actually lost his entire body and is a sentient arm nowand is forced to make some tea for some unknown deity'Cause he sure as hell can't drink it. Then I guess he goes insane because due to the OH SO WONKY physics engine YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT. Does it make you laugh? Yes, at first. Then after screwing around for a bit you get serious. You grab a cup, set it down, and then it does a flip and is upside-down so you have to do a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arm movements to get it back. And then it goes behind the water thing, and that's impossible to get out without using your magical powers of broken physics to effortlessly move the water thing. And then you make a jolted movement and your hand comes off. That's a game over, which is kinda funny at first. One time, I even went through the map and that was good for a laugh. But it starts to get annoying. Really quick. Honestly it's youtube bait at the core. The only thing it's good for is to gather a few friends and play it for a short laugh. If you want a youtube bait game that's hard, has an OH SO WONKY physics engine, is actually FUN, and is what this game is based off of, grab Surgeon Simulator. You won't be laughing horrendously hard at it but at least there's GAMEPLAY.Overall 5/10 I thought being British was supposed to be fun"

This game istea-dious, frustra-tea-ing, and lacks quali-tea.WHAT IT'S ABOUTAmpu-Tea is a Surgeon Simulator inspired game where you are an amputee fitted with a robotic arm and are tasked with making a cup of tea. In the style of SS, you control your robo-hand to attempt assembling different kinds of teas with the mouse and keyboard. The silly control style provides a challenge to this otherwise simple task and it will test your patience and eventually lead to some chaos.MY EXPERIENCE PLAYING THIS GAMEHonestly, this game was a disappointment, and I wasn't even expecting anything from it. My experience playing this game was mostly frustration, thanks to the awful controls and mechanics.There is no grip to pick up anything, so I had to rely on pushing things across the table with the hand and trying to balance cup handles around the fingers. Speaking of the fingers, grabbing with them is incredibly slow and insensitive, along with the hand rotation. It took mehalf an hourof messing around just to make one cup of tea because of how fragile the mugs are, how easy it is to knock the shelf off the table, the painful journey of moving the cup from each station, and how easy it is to break the arm itself.There is little variety in what types of drinks you can make, and no story or real motivation to make them except for a sticky note. The game description mentions being the son of an Earl, but I found no connection to that in the game. The achievements are (despite the shocking controls) fairly easy to get, minus the one for opening the game500 timeswhich I did not have the patience for. There are trading cards, but I uninstalled the game before I had enough game time to collect them.The only highlight I managed to draw from this game was being able to flip the table in rage. That's about it. I wish I had more to say.SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONIn short, Ampu-Tea relies on the 'joke game' factor and being a silly game for YouTubers to play. There are no outstanding features in this game besides being pointlessly difficult and having more 'Keep Calm's and 'EPIC FAIL's than is socially acceptable. It is not worth the $4.99 price tag, but if youreallywant to play it, wait for it to hit 90% off  on a sale at $0.49.I personally didnotenjoy this game and I wouldnotrecommend it."

This game goes far behind a difficultly controlled simulation where you make tea, who the hell ever thought making tea would be so stressful and infuriating at the same time.Once you get the controls, you would figure it gets easier from there, but it's very likely that your robot-hand will start jittering and fly off and you will fail the mission. Learning the controls are one thing, but mastering this game will definitely take some serious patience.The music is happy and full of energy, but about the time it starts getting difficult.. The music vanishes.. which makes it even more difficult seaming..Buy this game if you're looking for one  of those simulation challenges."

If you want an exciting shoot-'em-up gaming experience, then Ampu-Tea is not for you - walk away now! That's right, get out of here, non-nerd, and don't come back!Now that the neanderthal troglodytes have gone, let's get back to the review.The aim of the game is to make a nice mug of tea, using a robotic arm.There are a number of different instructions given to you, in order to make several mugs of tea.However, the basic tasks are to get a mug off a shelf and then add a tea bag, some sugar, and boiling water - and then serve on a tray (there are several variations of these tasks).To start the game, push ""F1"" for English (assuming that is the language you want, of course) - I mention that because I have had the start screen come up looking blurred once, and couldn't read the instruction in the top left corner to press F1.Press ""H"" to show or hide the help screen - very useful for learning the controls.Don't be surprised if you knock the entire shelf of mugs off the table - I was knocking everything over before I got used to how the robotic arm worked.Try to manoeuvre the mug into place in front of the tea-maker, before adding any tea or sugar, as it is easier to do everything with the mug already in place.Picking up the sugar cubes can be a real pain. Be prepared to drop them many times.Hint: Put the tray in its place first (in front of the tea-maker), so you can serve the tea on it later (otherwise you can make your mug of tea and then spill it when trying to put it onto a tray).The controls can take a bit of getting used to, but then it's much easier after that.A good experience for children who might have a talent for robotics.This game is for nerds only - it is recommended on that basis."

Like a piece of garbage claw machine. I almost had the last three achievements when the hand popped off, and I wasn't even touching anything. Go play Bad Rats."

It is a horrible mix of mouse and keyboard buttons just to move at all. The controls are not intuitive and movement is so difficult it is frusturating. There are also a bunch of bugs that need fixing."

It gets funnier if you play with someone sitting with you and you can come up with jokes and make fun of each others fancy tea making skills. I like those ""clumsy"" games to be honest. Would not pay original price tho and the achievement that asks you to play 500 times is ridiculous. Would not recommend to people who take those too seriously, this game is all about how fun you can make it for yourself. Have some humor and a friend and you will enjoy."
