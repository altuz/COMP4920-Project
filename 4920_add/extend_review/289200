,Recommended,289200,9911748,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,BeholderVee,"This used to be my favourite game when i was a child. I bought it after beatin Warcraft 3, and loved it a lot. I also replayed it a few times and enjoyed it every time. About a year ago i tried to play Kings bounty, but enjoyed it a lot less than this game. Maybe it's nostalgia, but i really love that in this game every unit is separate, when in KB it's just one unit with the number. It makes it a lot more fun for me.This game may have bad graphics, but does this even matter? It's best part is the fighting system. It's not too long, so i didn't get bored with figths, which are, by the way, pretty different each time. If you played KB, you should know what i'm talking about. In Ascension it also matters how many units you put into one cell. It may be 1 weak soldier, which can be a bait, or a group of them. In the second scenario the group is more likely the distract the enemy, they can even protect more important units with their own bodies, which you couldn't do in KB, but the also can be destroyed by one hit of the wizard, while putting them into separate groups makes it longer to take them all down.The rpg part is not very developed, this is true. There is no skill tree or anything like that. But if you choose to be a wizrd, which is a wise choise, you definatly will enjoy finding new spells, like triple fireballs or distraction. Most of them can be bought learned from wizards in towns, but some, like fast travel spell, are hidden on the map. However, if you want the game to be more challanging, make your hero a warrior and don't learn spells.The world is divided into three continents. The land of humans, the land of orcs and barbariabs and the land of demons. Each of them is full of characters, secrets and side quests. It's really interesting to explore in ths game. If you do, you may find a worthy treasure.Side quests in this game are rather small, but more interesting, than just ""kill-bring"" ones. There are such quests as drinking competiton, detective quest. In most of those you can express your will. For example, in the detective quest you can either punish the criminal you find, or take his money + keep  him available as a merchant.There are also several items in this game, which cost a lot, A LOT of money. You'll have to complete some side quests in order to buy them. Those are armour, rings etc. Funny thing: you won't be able to buy some items. Merchants will tell you that they are no use for you. They are actually useful for a main caracter of the sequel, which is sadly not on steam. Those items are easter eggs of some sort.I found the plot interesting. The final battle is pretty epic. Plus there are some interestings parts of the main quests, in which you, for example, will have to get rid of all your weapons and armour, your whole army too, and dress as a monk in order to enter a city, taken over by a demon. Hten you'll have to fight him without all things you left behind. If you're a wizard - it's difficult. If you're a warrior - good luck.The in-game journal is done decently. It doesn't say ""kill 10 rats, dragonborn"". The notes in it always fit the atmosphere, and, if you read them, may contain useful hints.I definatly recommend this game."

It is a tad difficult at the beginning when your hero is too weak but then becomes quite enjoyable as things balance out a bit.  By about 1/3 of the way through you are becoming so powerful that the battles are pretty much a joke.  A few minor tweaks and the story, battles, and overall gameplay would shine.  It is pretty much set up so that whoever acts first in the battle comes out on top.All the same, it was 15-20 hours of decent fun."

The overall story is decent, but the side quests are pretty mmorpg like. The combat is pretty fun and since the game revolves around resource management of your army which is pretty much the walkthrough of the story. The side quest are there only there to boost you with stats and to expand your armies might. I have to admit though that some units and items are overpowered resulting in fights with allegedly powerful enemies to be over before the enemy even makes a move. Overall the game is pretty fun, it is an average to good game. Give it a try if you enjoy grid-turn based fightinng."

If you are concerned with graphics then look at the pictures before you buy(I think the graphics are decent but not up to date). If you are having trouble in the beginning read some guide or walkthrough before you decide the game is bad or to hard. Exploring and finding the shrine looking things and enemies to fight makes the game easier. You generally want bonuses to authority if you have a choice between bonuses unless you want the game to be pretty hard. Making your character a mage or using good ranged troops probably makes the game easier.

It came as a shock to me when I actually enjoyed the game.At the beginning it can be very difficult especially for new players, ME!, however it gives a good amount of side quests for you to gain levels. Overall the story is quite good.However, I feel as if the game was rushed towards the end because their was such a lack luster of side quest content.

The gameplay is simple, like that of King's Bounty. The story is cliche. The combat is can simply be broken down to four things: magic is overpowered, ranged attacks are just as good, melee sucks (as well as the heroes you can recruit, including the main character), and whoever goes first (has the highest speed) will win most of the time.Even though I just bashed the game hard with the above paragraph, I still enjoyed the game. Therefore I recommend it to those who like turn-based games. In fact, the first paragraph is just a warning to those who play the game on what to expect."

You have a hero, you beat bad guys up, increase your reputation and stockpile of gold,  and hire soldiers so you can beat up bigger/more bad guys, Poorly balanced, with ranged attackers absolutely dominating and physical strength for your main character being completely outclasses by magic, which does more damage at range to multiple targets. Despite this, it is a worth it if you don't expect too much."

The RPG elements balloon completely out of control very quickly until you're an unstoppable badass.  Basic services that should be in the game, such as garrisons, simply don't exist, and others, such as inns, exist but for no reason.

Normally i love turn based game, but this game is really bad for some reasons:1- Zero personalizzation. No leveling of the troups and you can only chose if being a warrior or a mage. 4 equipment slots (2 rings, an amulet and equipment). In a game like this it is the basic.2- It starts with a great idea (a king teleported to another region, quite naked), but the subquests are pointless. You are in a long straight way and you have to kill everyone and everything. That's all. If you took the quest you can have some gold bonus but nothing more.3- the control system is terrible. The camera is really too slow, and your control in the battle is quite none (if you have a strongest army you win, if equal is a matter of luck or bad AI, if lower you have no chance at all). Over that, the autosave system is terrible ... sometimes it saves after the beginning of a battle and if you can't win that battle is better that you have a close savegame ... this mean that you have to save by yourself, it's far better.

The battle loads, the enemies go first and lots of wolves or dogs or something just surround my main character and eat him. Game over. I couldn't even click once in that battle. I guess maybe you can load and juggle around which units go in which army slots and maybe not get killed instantly, but my patience ran out after that.

Some folks (myself included) have difficulty launching it on newer systems.  Simply going into the game files and deleting the graphic.cfg file fixes that.  That said, you will not want to try and adjust settings, it'll freeze the game on you.  You'll be stuck with default.  You'll get used to it.A lot of things are based on character level.  Each level gives skill points to use to improve your character.  Early on, and most fights, your character is largely a 'commander'/'placeholder' for your army while your troops do much of the fighting.Early levels; each skill point for leveling is worth 2 points for the attribute you assign them to...then 5, then higher as you go on.  If you hold off spending the skill points until later on, they will spend at the higher level.  Which means a lot of 'run-away' for the commanderSame with looting various treasure chests and, using various shrines...it's based on character level...so those can be gamed a bit, as well.  For chests, I chose to take authority kicks every time, to increase the command points for better troops/more troops.  Made plenty of coin just from the fights, to buy everything I needed.  Think I had 250k coin at the end, even after buying all the rings, and such, that I wanted.The fights can be annoying at higher levels when trying to cover key characters.  Save, fight, see how it goes...reload if key character gets killed, adjust character location within army, try again.Definitely worth the time to try, and play.(ETA)  The game did crash 3 times on me...each required a CAD out and end process; just FYI"

It works for me when I set it to use XP SP3 on compatibility settings, but the resolution isn't great with that for some reason.Anyway. Wow, this game has surprised me. Strong RPG element, you play Alexander, King of Airath, and control him on his quest to regain his throne. Apart from travelling around the world on your quest, the other big element is turn-based strategy combat. It's fairly simple to understand and to get good at.I thought after an hour that the game would take me about 10 hours to complete, having looked at the map. I got to what I thought would be the end of the game, and turns out there's a whole new world!Some minor flaws in lack of attention to detail - spelling errors, occasional graphics bugs, but nothing that I feel spoils the game.Enough difficulty that you can't just sail through, but not so difficult that you give up.
