If you completed the Max Payne Trilogy, yes.If not, play the New York Cop shootouts first and then enjoy this B-Movie Max Payne.You play as Victor Corbet, a DEA Special Agent that is being sent to southamerica to fight against a drug cartel. The cops down there don´t like you at first, they give you the name matador, you shoot a lot of bad guys, a few traitors are also in the ""plot"", the game is straight forward (like Max Payne 2, same Engine by the way) with a lot of stupid bad guys to kill.Don´t expect some revelutionary gameplay, smart AI or even a balanced difficulty.This game got B-Movie written all over it, but thats not a bad thing actually. The game was pretty funny when I´ve played it over a friends place in 2006 and it is still a fun game today."

Now that is has arrived on steam, I have finally had a chance to play this budget third person shooter. The best way I can describe this game is a max payne rip off with early splinter cell style graphics. The gameplay is almost identical to that in the first max payne(slightly less refined), with the character movements and even the bullet time effects being a direct copy. Its not quite as good as the max payne series, but for 3.99 its definately worth it."

If El Matador was a movie it would be something like Tango & Cash/Elite Squad and something with Steven Seagal, a cheap enjoyable action flick.Is it an amazing game ? No.Is it better than Max Payne? No.Is it a fun action shooter with smooth gameplay and full of cliches ? Hell to the yeah.Its fun, its fast, its cheap and its waiting to be picked up and played."

,Recommended,289280,26547810,"Posted: 11 November, 2016",all,Snort Cannon,"Poor Mans latino Max Payne.El Matador is a third person shooter which takes place in Colombia. You play as Victor a DEA agent sent to Colombia to fight the crime on drugs.The story is as plain and by the numbers as it seems. It hits all cop movie cliches and twists them in it's favor and it actually makes El Matador into a very charming game.As stated in the title the game is a massive Max Payne rip off. The gameplay is a very clear rip off of Max Payne. Everything from Bullet time jumping and dodging bullets comes back in this game, so if you played Max Payne you know what you can expect out of this game.El Matador is also full of bugs and glitches throughout. The game is rather old (10 years old if you're wondering) and it really shows it age. The textures pop in frequently, the character models look dead and the lip syncing is absolutely hilarious at some moments. The voice acting is also really really bad which adds to the charm.The shooting is rather stiff and cover proves rather useless so what you mostly want to do is keep running and jumping so you can avoid gunfire.The game is also rather short. There's only 6 chapters in the game and it takes 2 hours to finish all of it. After the first initial playthrough there is no replay value. For this game however being short actually helped it out a lot as the game is rather clumsy and the longer it went on the more flaws appeared.The game is also kind of difficult. In a lot of the stages you fight in very open areas and you actually don't understand where some of the gunfire is coming from.The game also has one of the worst endings I have ever seen, so don't get your hopes up for an amazing explosion filled finale.In the end do I recommend El Matador ? Weirdly enough yes. It's cheap and provides you a solid 2 hours of blasting Colombian cartels in the face.Final Rating:7/10Pros:+ Pretty Fun+ Hilarious Cop cliches do wonders for the storyCons:- Graphics are horrendous and so is the voice acting- Rather stiff gunplay mechanics- Terrible Ending"

I have played this game when it first released and remember it being plenty fun. Back in the day, I had a very bad rig (Intel Celeron 2.6ghz, Geforce 6200 256mb, and 1.5gb ram) I was lucky to run this game here lmao.In terms of fun, its there. It borrows the Bullet Time that Max Payne is famous for and uses it in its own form, even though there is a lot of similarities.Replayablity? I dont think so. It has its nice campaign but for the aficianados like me, yes lol.Worth? 4 dollars, are you ♥♥♥♥ting me? If you are worried about 4 dollars, you wont find it here. As far as I know the worst games to invest in are Infestation Stories, Bad Rats, Rambo and a couple of other ones.If you are interested in 3rd person shooters and adrenaline packed shooters, this is an investment you will like.I will update this thread as I play the game now and let you know about 16:9 support, controls, test of time and all of that.Any questions, let me know!UPDATE 1: Out of the bat, the game supports widescreen resolutions and multiple refresh rates up to 100hz. Really good for a game this old.Difficulty: Really unforgiving lol. This game isnt impossible but it doesnt take it easy on you. You need to play this on normal and forgive its laser accuracy that enemies possess.This game is painfully similar to Max Payne 2. They borrow the engine (I assume?) and have the same exact sound effect of the ingrams from MP2. Its ridiculous. Loosely based on the game. So dont be surprised if it reminds you of MP2!"
,Recommended,289280,14646863,"Posted: 25 February, 2015",all,Ray Van Mechelen,"Hmm... In my opinion, it is worth the price. (Must buy when being a sale.)That is true it has just about 5-6 hours story, but great game and graphic compared to it is published in 2006.Absolutely fully scripted game, but the shooting system and AI is good, the enemies throw back the grenade, take cover or attacking us directly.Lots of scene (eg. port, office, streets, storehouse, cave, jungle, ship) when you can fight. You can use bullet-time. It is very spectacular. :)I just recommend.PS. Just a tip: Save often. :P"
,Recommended,289280,18555070,"Posted: 18 October, 2015",all,somebody336,"El Matador is a Third Person shooter set in Colombia and centered around taking down a powerful cartel know as La Valedora. You play as a DEA special agent called Victor who quickly earns the nickname “El Matador” due to his effectiveness and ruthlessness on the field. Victor is more of an executioner than anything and will make no attempts to arrest anyone or secure any drugs. Pretty much all you will be doing throughout the game is killing from start to end. There are hardly any moments when your life is not at risk but without a decent storyline that may get old fast for some people. Countless hordes of goons will try to take you down and luckily they are fairly fun to fight. What separates Vincent from his peers is that he used to love the movie 'The Matrix' in high school and has somehow gained the power to dramatically leap through the air in slow motion. It is a useful move for a quick retreat when you are surrounded though there is a limit to how many times you can use it.Your ability to slow time will deplete as you use it and depletes even further if you kill a enemy during it's effect. Killing an enemy normally refills your slow-mo bar shown at the top of the screen. You will be able to toggle slow-mo on and off at will, whether you are standing or crouching and it lasts a long time. I have never had it run out and this ability can easily turn the game into a cakewalk if overused. Without it the game would be quite challenging as enemies are surprisingly good at finding cover and are excellent shots. To add to that, Victor is no superhero, he may have the ability to slow time but he is quite fragile. Taking gunfire will quickly burn through your health and while this game does have regenerating health, you can not rely on it. You gain about one hit-point out of 100 every 30 seconds so you will be there a long time if you want to be healed. Health kits are your only real option to patch yourself up and they can be found in many places like hanging on walls, resting on desks or by opening random cabinets.Armor can also be found and greatly increases the amount of damage you can take before biting the dirt. These are much rarer than health kits and  will not affect your movement  in anyway. You will frequently be accompanied by heavily equipped police officers, that also appear to wear body armor but in reality they are all appearance. They are pretty much near useless and will die if an enemy so much as sneezes in their direction. I say nearly useless, since it does help to reveal where the enemy is when they get shot and they do drop some valuable rifle ammo when killed. So your allies are walking piggy banks for the most part. Your enemies on the other hand are  highly skilled and hyper alert to everything around them. It will be impossible to go unnoticed and you will be gunned down quickly if you are out in the open. There is no cover system in the game, though you will definitely still want to find some cover via crouching. I quite liked the need for cover, it kept the game from feeling like a pure action game and added some tension as you pop out  of cover, while diving near your enemies in slow motion, guns blazing glory.Speaking of guns there are quite a few of them in the game and you will be able to carry all of them at once. You can't carry much ammo and many of them share the same ammo type, so it does force you to be careful with your shots. Annoyingly enough after every mission, they will take all your guns away and will send you back in with nothing but basic gear, making you scavenge more ammo and gear all over again. It makes sense that the police force wouldn't allow you to keep random weapons you got from a raid, but in a game where you are pretty much a space wizard, it just feels like pointless busy work. Most guns are too inaccurate and under-powered to be useful in any sense, so you will want to mainly stick to rifles or even a pistol over your shotgun. In enemy hands they are pinpoint accurate, frustratingly enough. Dual wielding is pretty pointless due to inaccuracy and low ammo supply. Some weapons have alternate firing modes like being able to set it to full auto or single shots, which is a cool feature that allows more options to take down your foes. Bullets even ricochet off of some surfaces and are still capable of killing either you or your enemies. That feature isn't used much but it was a neat gimmick.Glass also has a neat physics systems that allow them to break part by part in gunfights and it just looks awesome to see the aftermath of a battle in a setting full of glass. Your typical explosive barrels are also present but they take way too long to go off and will give your enemy plenty of time to kill you. Simply shooting him is far less trouble. Enemies dress in casual clothes most of the time and all fight pretty much the same way regardless of the weapon they have. An enemy with a shotgun will fire at you from a very far distance while a enemy with a pistol will try to rush you, it can be odd at times but nothing major. Bosses are the exact same as normal enemies and have no different patterns, the only difference being they have much more health and never feel satisfying to fight. They usually appear in the end of a mission and have no sense of importance. The missions end really abruptly, you will kill a boss and that very second you will be teleported somewhere else with no idea as to what just happened. They have no sense of flow and you will be at a loss as to what you are doing now and why. It has no sense of progression or upping the ante, the first mission felt the exact same as the last but in a different environment.The story is so bad that it would have been better if they didn't even try. There are multiple other characters in the police force, but having just finished the game, I couldn't for the life of me tell you the name of any character other than your own or anything about them. They are just there for the sake of it and add absolutely nothing to the plot or the events. I don't even know what I accomplished throughout the game. The ending was the worst I have ever seen, in any form of media, to top it off. El Matador would have benefited from just being a bunch of levels with no story, honestly. All it served to do was confuse the player, conveniently take away your weapons every mission and break up the action for some pointless banter. To make matters worse the voice acting is horrible and the Hispanic accents they were going for, are terrible as well. It could have been used to their advantage if they had made this into a cheesy, tongue in cheek kind of game, but nope, this game is dead serious in it's “narrative”. Environments themselves haven't aged too badly and it does inject quite a bit of color at times, which is a nice change of pace from the missions were you are in typical warehouses or sewers.Now here is the thing that will likely annoy or even ruin the game for some players. The shadows in this game are glitched out and randomly flick around, which not only look weird but will catch your eye due to it's movement and waste your valuable time in a dangerous gunfight. Another thing is the game only uses one CPU core for some reason, so if you are experiencing heavy slow down, just open the task manager, set all cores to on and it should now run smoothly. Moving on from the tech side of things, the music is decent but gets old fast. It has this nice techno beat and it makes sense in the first mission which is set in a club house, but that small loop of music plays throughout the whole game. Never have I been so fed up with the music of a game other than when I played The Slaughtering Grounds. Even after the bashing I gave the game in the last few paragraphs, there is no denying I had fun playing it. If it had lasted anymore than four hours it definitely would have outstayed it's welcome, but as it is, it is a decent little time waster."

Weapons are actually satsyfying to use, it's nice to one shot an enemy on the head with my pistel and see a cloud of blood fill his face as he turns into a ragdoll, sometimes they'll fly all over the place!The lack of checkpoints REALLY help the tension and add to the experiance, I don't savescum and it really made the game a lot more tense at moments because when you die you have to start at the begining of the level. Bulletime is usefull but it's a little TOO slow, there are a variety of weapons but sadly only a handfull of them you'll actually use because there are weapons that are just simply innefective, maybe it's just me but I found the dual UZI to be a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to use. The bossfights are just enemies with a lot of health but it's not neciccarly a bad thing, could've been more though. There's a variety of levels in this game, from jungles to mansions, nothing too special here. Music fits each situation but it may not be something you'll wanna download and put on a mp3 player.Overall this is a really good game, pretty underrated at that. Gameplay is where El Matador shines and I highly recommend this to any fan of the Max Payne series or third person shooters in general. Even the starting price of 5 dollars is worth buying the game for."

""El Matador"" is the story of DEA Agent Victor Corbett and his efforts to help overthrow a Colombian drug cartel. And you do this by killing wave after wave of armed peons with the occassional boss trooper thrown in there. El Matador has some good things going for it. The gunplay is nice, the levels are lively, varied and pretty well designed. The graphics are very functional and vibrant. The story is totally B-Movie but the voice acting is well done. So where does ""El Matador"" go wrong? Well, you know that whole ""shooting everything you see?"". Well that's literally ALL you do. You go from point A to point B while shooting every bad guy in sight and fight a bullet sponge of a boss at the end of the level. The second issue and by far the biggerst issue is the difficulty. Even on easy you will die and die a lot. You can take a couple shots okay but there are so many enemies coming from so many places that you will get mowed down in no time and while there is health available, it is really not there often enough. While El Matador is a pretty one note game, it does not wear it's welcome out over seven chapters which can be finished in about 4 hours (less if you don't die so much). Overall I really can't recommend El Matador. There are some very good things going for it but they're outweighed by the  ridonkulous difficulty. 5.5/10 from me."

Can't say it was fresh even then, back in the 2006. And now it even cannot be started with almost any decent GPU, not to mention newest ones.Don't cry for it. It was a clone for Max Payne game, only with generic and cliche-over-the-top drug-hunting-policeman story. Visuals were bad, and I mean, really bad, worse than in Max Payne 1 (which was shipped in 2001). Backstages were somewhat colourful, however, I can give them that. Controls and move-caption were decent (as 1/2 of what we saw in Max Payne). And it was a long game, by the TPS standards. But because all the subject was pretty dumb, it wasn't leave any marks in my memory.RIP, another generic Cenega useless shooter. I'll score a 4.99/10 on your grave.PS: little 2016 update: the game is not running properly on the Win 7, Win 8 and Win 10.

Victor Corbett, DEA, after prologue mission (where he gets to shoot up a night club alongside Mexican Federal Police to catch a bad guy) is being sent to Colombia where he, was assigned by Colombia National Police chief to ""observe"" a local drug meeting. When his observation post was hit by RPG, he fought his way out and went on the exterminate multiple drug barons, with a bit of help on the local side... but as you can guess, there's going to be a huge betrayl at the end... who's the real bad guy, and who's just a pawn?The short of it is you're basically lead through a rat run of bad guys here and there, and you'll get to exterminate them with extreme prejudice using variety of weapons, from twin pistols, to pistol with scope, twin SMGs, to various assault rifles (some with scope), sniper rifle, even grenade launcher, RPG, and LMG (light machine gun).This is an old-school shooter with no autoheal. You have to find first-aid kits and armor to keep going. And there's no nav pointer either. You figure out which way you need to go, and it's usually pretty obvious. If not, explore a little.Apparently Corbett racked up such a body count after that first mission in Colombia someone bestowed ""El Matador"" callsign on him, thus the game title.Production values are not bad for its time, and there are a lot of things to shoot up, and enemies are upgraded thus. You start with common thugs, and by the end you're looking at virtually enemy commandos. But the game mechanics doesn't change much... Single-path rat-runs. Periodic boss or mini-boss battles.Graphics are not too bad given this game is more than 5 years old. Sound is... tolerable. This game at first gave me horrible skipping sound, and this was apparently a RealTek problem that disabling some unused ports SPDIF and such cleared it right up.I doubt this is any good for modern players, though. I'll recommend it, but remember, it may not suit your tastes.All in all, this is a retro game. if you miss this sort of shooter, buy it, and play it. Don't expect realistic plot or physics or that sort of thing (this guy was carrying about 6 pistols, 4 SMGs, about 6 assault rifles, 3 shotguns, and a LMG and/or more by the end... Hahahahaha.

So the only way of playing that worked for me was to get behind cover and shoot them through the wall (i.e. wallhacks) and heavily abuse the quicksave feature.The story is basically ""kill drug people"". The lighting is buggy. Animations often don't play. Enemy grenades seem to spawn from fixed locations instead of being thrown. Level design is pretty good though, and the music is fitting but simple and doesn't loop smoothly.It's somewhat fun, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you desperately need another TPS. If you do play it, I highly recommend that you switch to easy mode so you can go faster, which is more fun. This does however make it even shorter than my 4 hours on normal."

It is sad that you can´t turn the shadows completely off. You´ll alway have to deal with the atmospere destroying shadow errors.

I enjoyed this game more than Max Payne 2 TBH. The combat and the weapon aiming and just shooting all the bad guys with ragdoll physics is too satisfying to go past. Would pay $10 for this game no second thought.

There is nothing amazing about the game but nothing bad either. It tries to act like Max Payne but it isn't. The game is challanging at first until you get the better guns, and then its much easier. It is very short, only 4 hours long, but for a game thats a buck, that isn't bad. If you enjoy cheap fps games, then get this game I guess. It's better then other cheap FPS games I've played but hardly the best."
