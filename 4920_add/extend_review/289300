If you like RTS, third-person shooter, strategy, and a challenge, this is for you. The levels are very nice and the mechanics compliment the time setting. It also has some pleasant blends including with Role Playing genre.However, the game does have its issues. For example, the objectives are obscure and I often find myself a few steps behind my computerized teammates. It still requires some work, because small issues, such as the ridiculously low health of armored heavy machine guns, or the surreptitious change in objective. Overall, I'd still recommend this game to anyone wanting a challenge or something different altogether."
,Recommended,289300,11540566,"Posted: 3 August, 2014",all,G3N3,"Faces of War is a highly recommended strategy wargame which has been made by a collective of talented game developers. This isn't the first installation in their highly successful franchise, and for those players which are interested to see from where it all began, i suggest you purchaseSoldiers: Heroes of World War IIIn this review, i will try to keep the whole overview of the game as short and simple as possible, so you yourself decide, whether this title is for your future enjoyment or not.The first thing to actually keep in mind while looking at Faces of War is the fact that the game is rather old, and what used to be it's forte back in the day, to say the least, is now outdated - the graphics. Today, with games such as Company of Heroes 2 available on the market, this RTS looks a bit flat, but it is still nonetheless unique in many ways. One of it's bright and unmatched sides is the direct control over nearly any unit availible on the battlefield, ranging from your vulnerable yet versatile infantrymen to a mighty King Tiger tank. Direct Control, by the way, is especially thrilling when used while commanding a tank or some other land vehicle. This slightly changes the game from an RTS to a shoot'em'up action (might sound like a joke, but it's not). The in-game physics, even to this day, are awesome. Tanks explode, with turrets and armor bits flying everywhere. Structures, along with landscape, are completely destructable. This was also the case with Men of War's predecessor, which i have wrote earlier in this review. The atmosphere of the game is highly detailed and authenthic, regarless of the oudated graphics. The audio in the game is of very good quality, including both the original soundtrack and the sound files themselves. Machine guns rattle, explosions dominate the battlefield, soldiers scream in the heat of the battle, and all of this is accompanied by a decent amount of good generic soundtracks.The game has three campaigns, German, Allied and Soviet one, which are all split up into three mini-campaigns. Battles range from small firefights and even covert, commando operations to massive battles (an especially good example of a mission with a massive battle isthe last German mission which involves a huge armoured full scale assault on an allied occupied town)Another part of the game which made FoW unique is it's multiplayer. Unfortunately, since Gamespy has been shut down, playing this game on-line is now next to impossible... And as far as i have heard, even before GS ceased to provide it's services, practically nobody played this game on-line lately, prefering rather to play Assault Squad 2I recommend this game for it's sheer quality. Out of the downsides, i can outline only the oudated graphics, the lack of multiplayer(if your really want to play, you can hook up with some other guys and play a local game on Hamachi) and perhaps  my own subjective feeling of the game not possesing that *hollywood* image to it which is very often found in games these days. FoW is a good game which you play instead watching, and will bring you both a good challange and a fun time."

I play it since 2007 but not that 1.04.1 sh@t version the original 1.01. and i probably have at least 500 hours gameplay(it maybe 1000+ idk :D)!! Really good strategy game what u can be use like a 3rd person shooter, a lot of weapons, looting system, lot of vehicle types and it allow you to get as much vehicle as you want in the game, awesome game controlling,good graphics,nice physics,no big bugs(i dont even remember if i find bugs in it) .Back in the days it had a great community, lot of people from lot of country it was really really enjoyable!.I really miss those days :'(Back in those days i would say to you ""BUY IT ASAP MOTHA♥♥♥♥AAAA!!!!!!""But NOW...its different !!First of all, gamespy stop support FoW servers, so the game not even let you go in the multiplayer section.You just can use it in Lan with hamachi or tunngle or etc  After the MoW series , the FoW community became small, but you always find servers on it and you always enjoy when you play with it!Not just me and my friends think that FoW is way better than ANY! MoW game but a lot of old gamer who i talk with. Its maybe just because we grow up play with FoW, i dont really know but i dont even care at all.If i can go back to those days to play again FoW in multi,  i would do it.

I personally like the controlls that let you have the abillity to drive a truck or tank your squad is in.  The controlls also let you shoot/walk your man in a squad to a loctation, basically like a 3rd person shooter.  I really love the action in the game.  Great thing to play if your into RTS, stragety, and combat sims.  This game is a classic, and everything fit in like a puzzle.9/10"

76561198192703735,Recommended,289300,16132856,"Posted: 2 June, 2015",all,michael.dolan,"I really liked Faces of War.  If you enjoy WW2 real time strategies or other war RTS games, you will like this one.  There are three campaigns and each one has about 8 missions.  The missions are challenging, fun, and can often take a few hours to complete.  It took me over 40 hours to complete the game.  It could probably be beaten quicker.  However, I like to take my time.  I also got killed quite a few times and had to reload.  Of course I saved often throughout missions.One of the other things I liked was that although the game was challenging, it wasn't so hard that I would get stuck on missions.  There were a few missions that seemed impossible but I somehow got through them.  The game pace is good.If you are new to these games, play through the tutorials at least twice.  There are some things such as calling an ally.  I got about halfway through and forgot how to do that.  Calling an ally is helpful and I wish I would have done it sooner.  Also, some vehicles might not move, even though they are not damaged.  Check the gas.  The tutorial explains how to fill up a tank or other vehicle.  Trust me, having vehicles, especially armored ones, makes life much easier.The bottom line for me is that if you like RTS games, get this one.  I picked it up in a bundle with Men of War and had never heard of it prior to playing.  I'm glad I did.  Honestly, I would gladly pay the $4.99 for this game."

The game is pretty hard as you often only get to control 1 squad of soldiers without any vehicle support, this bumps the difficulty up and forces you go scavenge enemy equipment, but i like the challenge. The game also has some good mission variety and cool maps. It ran very well and i experienced no crashes. Overall I enjoyed playing it and would recommend it to any MOW or RTS fan!"

I knew going into it that it would not be the same as Men of War, but similar. I thought the gameplay was just like the Men of War games, and I enjoyed it, being a bit challenging at times, like most Men of War games are. The controls, however, are a bit different than the traditional Men of War type, where now you must click different tabs for different unit commands, instead of having just one tab for all, which is a bit meticulous. This is my only complaint. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good RTS that has a few challenges. Good game."

And yes, I like it.As long, that is, if I stick to multiplayer or my own created maps. The standard campaign missions are a total pisstake. As is quite often a feature in Russian made games the difficulty level ranges from extremely hard to totally and utterly impossible, so impossible in fact, that it would be easier to try to gobble one's own♥♥♥♥♥♥ (And we all know how impossible THAT is!) What is also common feature in Russian made games is anti-cheat elitism..... this is yet another game that has NO cheat codes AT ALL..... despite it SCREAMING out for them! Even internet prescribed direct editing of the game's hidden difficulty settings files (hidden in the game.pak file) has made NO difference whatsoever!Ever played the absolute godawful ""Commandos"" series of games? With their hair ripping-out gameplay style of:-1) Make one step2) Still alive? Then save!3) Make another step4) Dead? Then reload and try a different step.5) Still alive? Then save again!6) Goto 37) SCREAM IN FRUSTRATION!8) SMASH MONITOR!Edit: This overly profane difficulty does not appear quite so much in the later ""MoW"" series, the developers toned the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t down it seems! Probably as a result of a lot of criticism!Well most of the ""FoW"" campaign maps end up exactly the same! One of the many cheat websites at least had a savegame you could download that opened up all the campaign maps for you. This is the only way you will ever get the chance to at least try them all. But you will still never ever win 75% of them!Also typical of Russian made games is the utterly ABYSMAL English translations. Though I've seen worse, eg ""Cuban Missile Crisis"" and ""Blitzkrieg"". I often wonder how bad other languages have been translated in Russian made games!Edit: The developers also must have heard complaints about this too..... in the follow-on ""MoW"" series the translations are VASTLY improved!Despite the above issues, which are not the game's fault, but down to deliberately malicious map design and using Google Translate to do all non-Russian language texts, this game is wonderful! As I said, stick to multiplayer, or your own maps, ♥♥♥♥ the pre-made campaigns and you'll love this game!"

76561198038132122,Recommended,289300,33412125,Posted: 9 July,all,ForestWolf,"Rating: mediocre (5/10)IntroductionFaces of War is a real time strategy ""Blitzkrieg"" type of game, where you get limited amount of troops to finish the mission. Since you do not have the ability to build a base or produce units like in most other strategies, Faces of War provides some challenge at higher difficulty settings if you try to finish it quick.Gameplay & Story: 5/10The story is based on 2nd World War events where after picking a faction you want to fight for, you try to fulfill different objectives to gain some advantage for your fighting side. The campaign is seperated by single missions that do not have any connection to each other, besides some story description. The story is supported by some details about the events that supposed to have occured during WW2. The gameplay consists of only managing your squads and units that you receive to finish the mission.Combat & Challenge : 5/10The combat itself is simple but some missions require micro-management to use your units in most effective ways. There are some different types of equiptment that units can use, so adjusting to different objectives and situations helps with progression. If taken slowly, the game does not offer much challenge since you can always re-draw units, heal them up and re-capture strategically important positions.Graphic & Interface : 4/10The graphic look quite aged but the graphical details that most fighting scenes have are fitting the game really well. There are a lot of spots where units can take cover, destroyable surroundings and even the weapons and other gear dropped can be seen and picked up. The interface ingame is a bit overloaded with icons so it takes quite a while to figure all needed actions and commands for managing the squads.Progress & Mini-Games : 4/10There are no mini-games and the whole progress is done by completing missions for different factions. Since the missions are not connected, it does not feel like you are progressing through the whole game, instead you get focused on single missions losing the big picture of the war.Audio & Immersion : 6/10The audio gives a nice feedback during the battles where the biggest fire fights happen, where the heavy weapons and tanks are placed. The music provided a nice background sound without being too intrusive. The immersion during the missions was definetely on a high level, but sadly goes lost once a mission is finished and the campaign window is displayed until the next mission is started.Side-NotesThis game is single player only.This game contains no achievements, nor ingame neither steam.This game offers none to minimal replayability. If you played it once, you will most likely never touch this game again.This game is fairly short, if you speed up the combat regularly.This game is often sold in bundles or being discounted.SummaryFaces of War is an enjoyable blitzkrieg type RTS game and will most likely gather your attention for at least few missions. It is quite fun to finish each mission once, but since the game is fairly short and offers only minimal replayability, it is only advised if you enjoy older RTS and especially blitzkrieg and WW2 games.I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game. Rate and leave a comment if you enjoyed reading it.~ForestWolf"

Other times.... i spent 3 hours crawling around a trainstation, picking off constantly respawning enemies, only to die because for some reason, AI snipers can shoot further than you can.Would i recommend this game? only if you want to know what spending any amount of money on something clearly not worth it is."

The only thing I dislike about this game is fog of war, where you can’t see anything unless one of your units is in the area.  Over all, FOW is like MOW with German, America/British, and Russian campaigns that takes you through different story boards. Just make sure you try to hit the tanks on the side to kill them."
,Recommended,289300,17120415,"Posted: 19 July, 2015",all,Gneisenau,"Faces of War has been (and still is) a fun ride with a good ammount of difference from other World War II RTS games to make it enjoyable for nearly everyone. The game is unique in that instead of finding yourself in control of a large mass of troops and armor as you would in games like Company of Heroes you usually end up with one or two squads of infantry ranging from 4-8  troops at the beginning of missions. This focus on a smaller scale makes realistic additions such as scavanging enemy corpses for ammo or searching boxes feel okay and not too heavy of a burden. Each soldier has his own inventory, allowing him to store ammo, repair kits, or even other weapons if necessary. Additions like these help to increase immersion into the game and keep you on your toes, having to think more than about what to kill next.The physics engine of this game is neat, if you miss and hit the ground with a tank or artillery piece a crater will appear, and you can tear down most buildings and scenery by shooting and/or driving over it (I especially enjoy driving over sandbags and seeing each individual one fall and get out of place.) Helmets fly off the heads of soldiers as bullets wizz by, and everything has a sort of heafty feel of realism. The graphics aren't too shabby either for being almost nine years old now, similar to or better than Company of Heroes in most aspects.When it comes to the bad there are a few gripes, but not major compliants. There are times when you run out of ammo (or even fuel if in a vehicle) and you are left thinking there might be a bug for a while because you aren't shooting/moving without any indicator large indicator. The AI can be dumb at times, for instance if your troops are out of ammo they will stand around and let the enemy shoot them without taking new cover or running around to find new ammo. At some points you end up being left with large numbers of troops/vehicles and you may feel overwhelmed as the game is more suited to controlling small groups. The voice acting is subpar for the Germans/Russians as in both cases they usually speak with crisp American accents (I suppose this is more acceptable than a poorly done accent, but it feels out of place none the less.) Finally, each of the three campaigns include the same tutorial, which is unskipable even if you have completed it before.In the end you should buy this game if you like either strategy or the WWII setting, it's simply fun."

You can micro and macro manage battles, you can control a team or aim and shoot as a soldier, tank or gun. Really fun gameplay, definetly reccomend it. Only drawback is that the tutorial missions are repetitive and if you are already familiar with the gameplay, you should have a choice to skip it.

,Recommended,289300,14717855,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,MaximillianPower,"Great game,  but there are a few big problems.  Firstly,  vehicles have a tendency to become unresponsive.  They'll be totally fine in terms of health,  and yet not be able to move.  Extremely annoying.  Sometimes troops become unresponsive too (my flammenwerfer was standing waiting to be shot last mission).  You can't capture all vehicles which is disappointing if you've eliminated the enemy and want to go for a drive.  Basically it's very fun but there are some annoying things.  And you have to exit by hitting ESC at the menu.  If you use their exit game button,  you will try and get back into it and Steam will say,  ""sorry,  it's already running""."

It's current price on Steam.The gameplay is very good. It pulls you in for hours at a time.The graphics are good, everything looks realistic. Not the best, but realistic, and I'm not getting any lag.Squad control has some bugs. It might have been better if the battles were turn based or stop action.When actions start everything happens very fast. I recommend saving very often, like after every skirmish.The unit A I works very well for both player and enemy units.There are some bugs with units getting stuck on objects, but not that often.There is no real character development, or skill development, or leveling up.The story line is just enough to string together the different scenario maps.The units are all the same. The only thing that make one soldier different from the next is how they are equipped.A good solid game, with hours of challenging gameplay.I recommend saving after every skirmish.Don't start playing unless you plan to play all day."
