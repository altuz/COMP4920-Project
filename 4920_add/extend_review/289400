Though one thing that can be quite a pain is that at times the story can be a little hard to follow, but the log book can save the day there. There's quite a bit of space in this game, and the landing and moving about on the planets is quite unique (and quite well done to boot)! Let me say that I am a big fan of the X series (X Beyond the Frontier, X2, X3r, X3TC & X3 AP), and while is ain't X, nor is it ment to be, the fact remains that I find this game just about as interesting and enjoyable (and in some ways more maybe even).All in all this is an interesting take on a space sim. So, if your in to that, then you just might want to give this a try."

Fly the galaxy in a ""ship"", land on planets and take over outposts, board ships and plunder the loot, upgradeable combat suit and ship(s).Yes, the game crashed, once, and not once since.  Easy (enough) to read displays.  Decent graphics for its time (and for most indie-level games today), wide open play, great sandbox feel (after you play awhile, it opens up)."

This is what I call a holy grail of space games if it can be done right .Unfortunetly clearly 1C did not have experience to pull this off . While all aspects of open world spacegame are present none of them are done in the right way.-Space travel and combat are very disorienting .-Ground combat is a basic shooter with few options not counting minor item customization.-Enviroments and planets look rather dull and it is hard to tell what you need to be doing.This game expects you to learn a lot of things and tutorial does not cover all of them but if you don't skip tips you should be ok .You will stumble here and there but with the game so ambitios I am not suprised that they failed to provide solid tutorial overall.Unlike 2D Space Rangers 2 this game is striped of all the style and atmosphere that made Space Rangers great . I just don't find visual and story elements of this game enjoyable .6/10 . I don't think its a bad game but you have to be willing to learn how to play it and overlook some flaws ."

I started my first mission, landed on my first planet and still didn't know what was going on.After actually reading and listening to a bit of AI that speaks to you within the game, she gave me some good pointers to go look at my mission log book. The game is pretty cool, and reminds me of Star Trek Online way before it was even a thought. Parkan goes as follows, you have a ship that can be modified in many different ways. The suit you use when you transport to worlds can also be customized and weapons changed. The game is a FPS/RPG type game where you are able to build diplomatic ties with certain factions.The gameplay itself is first person in the ship and first person on the planet. The ship controls are done with the keyboard and mouse and provides for a decently rewarding firefight. This game provides it's own unique approach to FPS/RPG. It's not FULL OUT customization on the ship and suit (colors, decals... bla bla) but shooting rockets or lazers, go ahead and go nuts choose which one you'd like to shoot.Would give it an 8 if it was substantially different but due to it's age :RATING : 6.95/10GameplayC+Story / CampaignB+Visuals / User InterfaceC+Sounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityCOverallC+"

It has a lot of issues.  The voice acting is abysmally bad, and the game play gets very repetitive.  Each planet has one of a few prerendered environments and some cloned base layouts.  The game is open ended, but often it just feels like running in a hamster wheel, redoing some of the exact same things over and over.  Additionally, there is a steep learning curve, and a wide array of little nitpicky aggravations that aren't worth really getting into.  Despite this, the game is fun, really really fun.  It manages to be challenging in the right ways, and comes together as a coherent whole, even if it doesn't do so with the most style.  It won't win any awards, but you won't regret playing it.Bottom Line:It's only $3.99, that's a small price for a fun game that will give you hours of fun."

I'm running windows 7 with a decent system and haven't had a crash yet. I haven't gotten to the open world part yet so far its been pretty much guiding me along but its been a ton of fun.The story doesn't make a lot of sense so far. The movie seems sort of confusing but I think I got most of it. The voice acting while not great is horrible either. The little messages telling you want to do and explaining the game can be vague and sometimes you will get three or four of them right in the middle of a fire fight and don't have time to read them. Thankfully they save them all so you can go back and read them. All in all it did a pretty good job of teaching me how to play it a short amount of time. If you've played freespace or anything like it you should pick up the dog fighting quick.You start out fighint some pirates and then land to secure some data from a crashed ship and get your first taste of FPS combat. So far it seems passable. Nothing new or awesome but seems to do the job. There are ports that you will be able to take over and then defend agaist pirate attacks which seems like it could be cool.Your ship seems like it will be pretty upgradable. There is atleast four different systems you can change out also four gun spots and four missile spots. You can only have one gun spot and one missile spot active at a time but can switch between them at anytime.Also they have a energy system that I remember having fun with back in the x-wing/tie fighter days. You can switch power between your systems(shields, weapons, engines, and I think the last one was sensors).Over all I've had a lot of fun so far and will keep playing. I may or may not update this review based on how lazy I feel."

,Not Recommended,289400,13947354,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Meanie,"I bought into this game based solely on it's concept. I want to love this game so much, it has, at least in theory, everything I want in a space game. Spaceships that you can walk around in, planets you can visit, multiple factions you can join, a free roaming (but sometimes limited for story reasons) sandbox universe... It even has in-ship fighting where you can get boarded by enemies or board enemy spacecraft to comandeer it yourself.The game is a few years old, and the mileage doesn't give it any compliments. It has aged, and it hasn't aged well. It most likely wasn't even very visual-heavy back when it was first released back in 2007 either. But that can be forgiven. The real problem with this game is how the awesome concept is being executed. It's executed poorly. I walk around, doing stuff, going, ""Ah, wow, this would have been cool if they had made it like that,"" or ""this is kind of amazing, I wish they had expanded on that"" etc. Also, the planets and stations feel copy pasted and empty, defeating the purpose of being able to visit them anyway.In short, though it has many features, none of them feel fleshed out, and some are flat out stupid in their lack of polish. The story isn't anything to write home about either, possibly due to poor translation and sub par voice acting. Want to spend 5-8 hours tops fooling around in a semi open sandbox space sim thingy? It's 5 Euros or your regional equivalent. Is it worth it? Your call. I bought it, played it for a bit, kinda liked it, it was average. But I left it feeling unsatisfied. I would recommend waiting for another game that does this but better.Pros:Great conceptA few hours mindless funCons:Poorly executed conceptsIt ain't no lookerFeels empty"

76561197967471651,Recommended,289400,17602962,"Posted: 18 August, 2015",all,Russell,"This game is enjoyable but has a steep learning and wonkiness curve. By wonkiness I mean for instance that the default control settings make it impossible to play the game. Make sure to go to the settings and click 'default' to return the controls to a playable setting.Parkan 2 is an open world hybrid game. After a fairly lengthy intro segment of the game you are set loose on the world and can do as you like. However, you are given a series of missions which push the story forward and ultimately lead to a relatively linear and singular objective. The game itself is broken down into three main parts. Space segments where you fly around and dogfight against other ships or space stations, landing segments where you fight against machinery and humanoids, and indoor segments where you fight only against humanoids.The game is much greater than the sum of its parts. The individual components of the game are all relatively mediocre, but they actually work together to create an enjoyable and engaging experience. I had a great time upgrading my ship(s) and battle suit while progressing through the game. The downside is that the game lacks any sort of exploration incentives. It may boast hundreds of sectors but by the time you've seen 10 of them you've seen all of them. The translation job on the game was also a low level of quality with incoherence and typos more the rule than the exception. This is made even more frustrating given that the story is actually quite interesting and thought provoking.In spite of its flaws it's a game that somehow will keep drawing you in for more if you can fight through the intial learning curve."

Most of the game is pretty okay and even the graphics being a bit antiquade it doesn't make it worse.The voice acting is average, some is okay, some is awful, but at least you see most of them trying, so it is a good jobThe controls of the spaceship also works fine and you can control it pretty easily, although, the major flaw of this game, and also the reason that I can't recommend it, is the aim system.Once you automatically aim at them, your missiles will reach the enemy, which is ok, but your main weapon, the laser/gatling gun, won't be automatically aimed at them and you will need to manually aim at them and shoot. Which is really horrible, it is not precise, it doesn't have a good hitbox, it doesn't even show you that well if your shot was good, you can see, but it is not that good. It is awful, and it is the main objective of the game, so, not recommended because of it.If you want any more reason, well, it also tends to crash sometimes, so you'll be at risk playing this game if you don't save often."

Not a single human being in the game as far as I have played it other than a few cutscenes. It's just.. boring. It's like a dollar-store Elite. The voice-acting isn't good either.It's a good game if you want to simulate crippling loneliness, though. Me, however, I found it average and pretty much a huge waste of time.

You have a some freedom as to how you operate and what you do, but there were still some things missing. The ability to fly to asteroids and mine them for instance is an example, but I can accept that as this game is more a combination of a spaceshooter and fps.Things that really bring me down about this game is the bad English used, and how that creates some confusion about some missions. Nobody apparently looked over item and object descriptions before or after publishing the game, as it is full of spelling errors and wrong choice of words. This is weird, because the actual spoken text sounds (and with subtitles on, read) a lot better.Some thing that really worried me during installation from Steam was the download and installation of regedit.exe....a very dangerous tool that shouldn't be installed by a game, especially concidering you can make changes to the registry from C++ / C# (not sure where this was written in). Each and every Windows version can then make sure only certain parts of the registry can be changed, much more secure. And once I turned on fullscreen and full resolution the resolution bar stated 666 as the only available resolution. Probably a dev-joke, but definately something you might want to worry about.The game itself shows a pretty good attempt to combine different genres, but feels repetetive quite fast and therein lies its greatest drawback.A product of interest for people that like games outside 'normal conventions', but other than that it has suprisingly little to offer. Concidering myself such a person, I will still recommend this."

Combine that with low-budget, constant asset reuse, and remarkably bad translation and voice overs (the same guy literally voices over multiple characters, and it's beyond terrible) and you have a real dog.

With this in mind understand that it /is not those games/ merely inspired elements of them.Basically you can fly your ship, walk around your ship, attack other ships, or board and raid them.  You wear an upgradable battle suit, and whatever space ship your find yourself on can be upgraded too.On top of this you can build a squadron of drones, to act as wingmen in space, or mobile combat platforms in the style of x-com  for ground based missions on planets.  Although not critical you can ignore the plot and trade for a while to upgrade ships or weapons.The space combat works, but the temptation to simply board each ship steal their cargo and kill everyone on board is usually too great - particularly as the faction missions often need items you steal from enemy ships.Overall i dont regret buying this game, but dont be expecting star citizen or no mans sky in this game, take it as it is, an example of the progression of detail in virtual universe games."

To the best of my understanding, every time you board an enemy ship its interior is somehow connected to your own's and isn't properly cleared afterwards, which means after a few hours the game starts to lag while inside the player's ship and quickly gets unplayable even on reasonably powerful rigs. This glaring oversight hasn't been fixed in all those years since initial release so I wouldn't bet on them fixing it now."

I started the game, i tried to make it past the beginning of the game and i just couldn't stop laughing or cringing! And the casual way they game tells you that your totally screwed over is just to much. Lay off the vodka lol. I'm recommending this game for the fact that i couldn't stop laughing at the poor voice acting and Engrish use, not the fact that its a great game lol"

The game really tries to mix politics, space combat, shooter, colonisation, exploration and RPG together into one epic package. It actually more or less delivers in all espects - there are factions and some politics between them, you do fight in space, you can colonise planets, you do customise your ship and equipment, you can capture ships or planets in FPS game... But most of the puyyle pieces are of quite poor quality.Game was quite bugged on release, it was not possible to finish main quests.Still I do recommend a game, for a price it is quite an experience and there is definitely enjoyment worth 4 bucks in it. And you can dream of the game with the similar refreshing concept, yet much better execution."
