Graphics is slightly outdated, game mechanics somewhat cranky, but - RPG system is nice, story is excellent, quests are very fun, lots of weapons and skills, large game world (prison planet). 8/10 for Russian version and it seems 6/10 or 7/10 for English version."
,Recommended,289420,9874762,"Posted: 19 April, 2014",all,User,"I kind of like it!The voice acting in the earlier parts might turn you off, but the gameplay has a bit of depth to it.The main problem is in the localization. Somewhere in-between the Russian version to the English version, the intended gritty setting got lost. However the much lesser English version is now hilariously funny due to the lacking voice work.It's like watching one of those B-movies and having a ""good time"" by making fun of it, but along the way you find a thing or two you enjoy.So if you'd like a laugh, and if you can stand some localization hickups then I'm sure you'll have a mildly good time with it ."
76561198001454789,Recommended,289420,13161908,"Posted: 30 November, 2014",all,Charming Cthulhu,"After the character creation, which is basically exactly the same as Fallout's, I, Boar, survived a crash landing on Planet Alcatraz. When I regained my consciousness, two men with meat cleavers stood in front of me. Disco music started playing and I killed my first opponent by kicking him in the balls. The next guy took a few punches into his faces, but I won. I took their clothes off and put on a poncho. Suddenly, a man without pants crawled towards me and told me to finish him off. With the words ""You like that, scumbag?"" he received a kick into his head. Then, I took out my recently acquired meat cleaver and started hitting him, but I kept missing. Finally, he was dead. I proceeded my journey and suddenly there were another two men who wanted to see me dead. They were strong, but luckily I could eat three potatoes just before I died and so I beat them. I carried on and reached a village. The guard in front of the gates shouted ""My spear overcomes yours!"" and he threw his spear at me. It pierced me but it didn't stop me, and so we ran at each other and with a single hit in the head he went down. Afterwards, I entered the village and I stood in front of three men with assault rifles and shotguns. Even my potatoes couldn't save me this time.So far, I had a lot of fun. The game mechanics are alright, the dialogues are cheesy and sometimes you just can't avoid laughing. However, it's laggy. Every second the game freezes for a few frames which is very annoying.But still, Planet Alcatraz is definitely worth a try.Update:Rule #1 in Russian games: Somewhere, sometime, you are going to find a bottle of vodka. Now I understand why there are so many potatoes in this game."

For this rpg:  its a nice game with a lots of fun. no mages no spell casting, it has a different tough world. if you get bored of high fantasy spell casting rpg games give it a try. I think Price is really cheap for a game like this."
76561197970781615,Recommended,289420,12371304,"Posted: 4 October, 2014",all,aslee4,"This game feels like Riddick and Fallout had a baby. A russian baby that couldn't talk but otherwise had the best attributes of both. The gameplay is basically Fallout with RTWP combat, and the story (if you can deciper it) works pretty well (good justification for why gear would ramp up the way it does, and a lot of scrounging).The game is surprisingly fun as long as you can ignore the voiceovers and can translate some of the translations. Don't necessarily expect a huge number of non-combat solution to problems (you will be fighting a lot) but there appears to be a large number of alternative resolutions to quests (i.e. who you side with). The writing/translation is dubious but the actual plot is pretty entertaining."
,Recommended,289420,20173943,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,Profit Prophet,"It's the 26th century. You're an imperial soldier sent as an undercover convict to a penal colony on Planet Alzatraz with a mission to sabotage a spacecraft the convicts are building to escape the planet. The landing pod crashes, you are separated from your teammates, get captured and thrown in a labor camp. Because of your excellent build and opportunistic tendencies, you quickly rise through the ranks and become the go-to person for many Planet Alcatraz inhabitants, who have 25 hours' worth of quests for you.The RPG-style 3rd person game lets you build your skills, as well as those of the members from your old squad which you pick up along the way. Overall, the game offers 2 major mission campaigns with dozens of places to investigate and clear out, and a final push through 3 extremely difficult areas to reach a shuttle and escape Planet Alcatraz. At one point, you're required to find item F for person E who has unfinished business with person D who first wants person C dead, but they turn out to be dead, and the trail is found with person B last seen at location A but it turns out he's actually held captive at location Z... this is just an example.Pros - Immersive storyline and missions which get you really enthused to level up in the right skills. Fair hit system, smooth gameplay (although the animations are quite wooden), generous XP and money rewards for quests.Cons - The storyline is pretty linear. It gives you the illusion that you can play both sides, but in the end you're left with no choice with regards to your loyalty. The developers could have spent more time developing alternative endings. Graphics aren't the best since the game came out in 2009. There isn't really a big variety of weapons, most are absolutely worthless and there's only 2-3 ones worthwhile keeping. Not many places to go for XP. Enemies can be permanently elimiated, so once you clear out an area it stays clear after re-loading the area."

And there aren't enough interesting drops (see items) to motivate you, and no motivating quests...It often is the basic thing : Kill x monsters and return, bring me this and that...Items:There are lots of clothes to find but they don't have any interesting stats only amour and an attitude rating which I've never experienced influencing anything, they just look different.And there isn't much of an interesting weapon choice, neither.I found ranged weapons to be even more useless than melee weapons at least most of them.Characters:They all seem very dump, dialogues are a bit funny and often pointless. You'll sometimes have different group members, but they have nearly no personality and they react not too intelligent.There are a lot of unimportant nameless people running around always doing the same thing (dancing, cleaning)Graphics:Is o.k. but won't keep you exploring, small square-like maps which are all very similar to each other.---> I wouldn't recommend the game, but for that low price, or better, on sale, you can try it, there are some funny sequences in it, but the gameplay is very annoying ( I often found me rather forcing me to play it any further than actually wanting it)"

I'd played 7.62mm, another game from this dev, and thought I might check this out since I liked that. I expected a tactical rpg in the vein of jagged alliance, and that's more or less what I got.ButI wasn't prepared for the main character sounding like he learned english entirely from british radio announcers, or for the game startin with a black man chucking a spear and me and yelling about spirits. Later I ate some potatoes, killed a man and took his beret, and fought a Gorrilloid.10/10 what even is this"

Makes it hard to take the game so seriously, while not complety spoiling it.Soory if my reveiw is harsh for person who didn't sovery far in this.I may write something more complimentry after a few more plays."

(So is combat)It's mimicing Fallouts SPECIAL and skil system (which isn't a bad thing).Sorry, maybe there's a decent/okay game past the first few hours, but that's time wasted and better put into other games. (Like your/my money)I'll get a refund on this."

But I feel the need to explain.The worst voice acting I have ever encountered and I am including Gemini Wars in that comparison. It sounds as if one guy did the voices for all the characters.The character sprites are a mess.The graphics are not TOO bad considering the game as a whole.I like RPG games and can forgive them a lot. IF you can get past the voice and the horrific translation work then it is enjoyable but considering this is the same people who brought us Space wolves.... Yeah....The story is there but I have trouble finding it. You know the objective of the game from the start, it sits at the top of your quest log. The problem is you are never given this quest. You simply start with it. You are given no back story for your character, No idea why you are there or what you are supposed to do.The other unfortunate thing is the dire need for a spell checker. A copy and paste into a word processor can solve any number of problems, there are many free programs that would have done the job.The music score is nice though, has a catchy tune I like.The RPG system is a little limiting, almost Spartan in its design. It is a modification of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system used by the FALLOUT games. All they have done is change Endurance for Constitution. It works well and like Fallout you must weigh up what you will need at the games start against what you will need later as more and better weapons become available. It is a tried and tested equation that makes sense.There are a lot of good idea's in this game and some even come to work well, but the game as a whole has just got too many weights around its ankle to stay a float.Story: Absent presumed dead.Graphics: Passable.Voice acting:  Monotone and mismatched.Translation: Lost there-in.Game play: Relatively straightforward.Quest continuity: Following its own tail."
