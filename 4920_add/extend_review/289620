Set in post-apocalyptic Ukraine, the game is reminiscent of Resident Evil, with historic Japanese undertones & an art-style similar to that of 80s-90s anime. It is by no means a perfect game, but features some stunningly beautiful environments, fantastic sound design & a suitably energy-packed electro-industrial soundtrack."

Balanced alright, few but pretty large chapters (10 total + Prologue, I think), the visuals are solid, destructive bits are nice wherever involved, and it doesn't bore for the 20 hours it took me to complete it digging into every single corner for secrets. Fair warning, though, the game appears to crash occasionally (probably some overflow issue), and a pair of save files around the tank boss end up corrupted and impossible to load from.Other than that... Yeah, I loved it in 2008, and I love it still."

Defeat waves of enemies that spawn out of nowhere to move forward. Melee is hold a direction and spam left click, but the blocking system is so basic that you get whooped by large groups of melee enemies unless you resort to your pistol with regenerating ammo. This results in you jumping around the  area until it reloads, dumping the mag into someone, and repeating. Enemies are very derivative of Half Life. Story is very B Movie. Couldn't stick with it for much more than an hour"

Especially the one at chapter 3: that's the most beautiful sky I've ever seen.Layouts of levels are done skillfully to take as much playtime as possible from each location without protracting it.Checkpoint placement is done perfectly. You get a checkpoint after every fight and after every hard jump, so you will never find yourself in need to replay parts of the game due to save points being too far from each other.The battle system will look odd and clumsy until you take some time to get used to it. When you do, it becomes pretty fun and similar to Painkiller: bunny-hop, fast movement.Additional challenge comes from enabled friendly fire. Unlike many other games here you can hurt friendly NPC who help you, but don't worry: it is balanced out by their quickly regenerating health.Swordfighting part seem lackluster: first your health drops faster than enemies' then you learn standard routine: use strong combo to knock down an enemy, then finish him before he stands up. Don't expect to find depth and variety here. There are many moves to use, but it seems like only difference between them is animation.QTE during boss fights also don't seem like a good idea: they make you too concentrated on pressing keys to enjoy animations and camera movements.Following the story is interesting. Characters are charismatic. Writing style and voice acting are done exceptionally well.Strong atmosphere, originality and variety of the environments, great writing style and acting, soundtrack and combat similar to Painkiller will keep you immersed in the world of Collapse and eager to keep going farther, wondering about what will happen next. It's a huge pleasure to explore beautiful locations and solve challenging puzzles. Do not miss this game, because it is just what you need."

,Recommended,289620,22022198,"Posted: 24 March, 2016",all,Xandão,"An interesting game: It could be described as a mix between Max Payne and Devil May Cry. A third-person action game in which the gameplay constantly shifts focus between melee and ranged combat, though you're usually free to employ both (the effectiveness of ""mixing it up"" will, of course, vary with the nature of the engagement) as you see fit.At first, the game makes it look like its melee combat will be highly nuanced, as if subtle negotiation of space and exquisite knowledge of enemy patterns will be required, but this illusion quickly falls apart. As you get acquainted with the game's systems you will learn that you can, for example, safely mash the action key whenever you're near an enemy, even as you hold block, and easily perform the contextual throw counter (which often allows for an easy instant kill on downed enemies) without ever really reacting to the prompt shown by the game (or to the enemy's movements at all). The game has, nonetheless, some memorable action set pieces, and some rather good boss battles (even if most of them involve QTEs at some point).You begin the game with four main combos, one for each primary movement direction, and as you advance through the story you learn ""super combos"", which are enhanced versions of the regular directional combos. These are activated by timing the third hit of a combo correctly. These are much superior to regular combos as they have greatly enhanced damage output and often perform knockdowns - so after you acquire these, you will end up pretty much only using the old, ""non-super"" combos by accident. The very last super combo you learn, ""dragon tail"", deals so much damage and covers such a large area that there's almost no reason not to exclusively stick to it for close combat. As the game progresses, you also end up acquiring four different special skills called ""energy blows"", which can aid you in combat or in solving the game's simple environmental puzzles.Regarding the plot, Collapse has quite a bit of radio chatter, including calls you can make to learn about the game's story and setting. On this detail: It has a ""secret"" (it is not actually hidden since you can see the missing call log after the point of no return - You can then simply revert to an older autosave if you so wish) fork in the story which involves making a radio call at a specific point late into the game. All it appeared to change was that a specific character did not die in a cutscene right after this ""secret call"" becomes available - The ending of the game seemed to remain the same. Speaking of the game's ending, there are some rather aggravating jumping puzzles to be found in the latter sixth of the game or so.The framerate would sometimes inexplicably plummet despite my machine far exceeding the recommended system requirements. I had around five crashes total (Windows 7). The last two pieces of information (files you can find scattered about the levels which contain details on the game's plot and world) were apparently bugged - they were completely blank to me. I will cautiously recommend Collapse: There is some undeniable jank to it and its presentation (it does NOT look like a game released in 2008), but there are also more than a few positive aspects to it. In the end it is mostly a well-paced experience that was an obvious labor of love, even if it ends up coming off as more than a little derivative."

I feel like in most modern day shooters comabt has become very formulaic, duck behind cover, pop out, shoot a few times.  If you get shot wait a few seconds for the red on the screen to fade and repeat.Collapse does not fall into this pattern at all, you have a health bar and it does not recharge.  There are a pretty generous amount of health pick-ups along the way, as well as health paks that you can store(up to 3) that fully recharge your health, but monitoring your health is important because if you take too much damage it can hurt you later in the level.There is cover, the battlegrounds are generally littered with it, but the cover is extremely destructable and if you think you can hide in one spot and pop in and out you will die a pretty quick death.Instead the game encourages a fast paced run and gun style of play.  If you are strafing the enemies generally have a hard time hitting you so it is important to be on the move constantly and occasionally duck for cover when needed to catch a breather for a moment.  You have access to 2 guns, a sword and several powers that slowly recharge as time goes on and combat varies from huge gunfights to a bunch of armored thugs rushing you with swords.It is all fast paced and generaly a lot of fun, and the mix of swordplay/gunplay and smart use of powers make the combat in this game a lot of fun.The story here is pretty good with a nice twist, there are a lot of optional conversations you can have and a lot of documents you can find that flesh out the story, it is nothing amazing but it is better than what is found in the average 3rd person shooter.My only complain about the game is near the very end of the game there is a platforming section that is abyssmally done.  This game is a great shooter but a terrible platformer and the fact that the developers chose to throw in 2 platforming sections (one on act 8 and one on the last act, 10) is very annoying, liberal checkpoints help but you will die on these things and you will be annoyed.It is not enough to deter me from recommending this game though, it is a fun, fast paced game and if you are into good 3rd person action games you should give it a run."

Is it going to crash on you sometimes after you die? Yup.

I got it really cheap, so for that it is nearly worth it. For a 2008 game, and indie at that, it is not all that bad. Lots of hack-n-slash. One big problem, not enough weapon choices and you can only hold 3 total. Your sword, pistol, and whatever secondary weapon you stumble across. Want that rifle and sniper? Nope. Worst part of the game; got to a boss and knocked down his health all the way. Then a quick time event pops up where you have to slash at it and for a very split second make sure you tap the right direction key. I HATE those. Extremely linear pathway. It felt like all the basic elements were there, but each of them was just not good enough to be noteworthy, in the good sense at least."

Before I purchased the game I read reviews before hand such as it being some like a cross between Max Payne and Devil May Cry which are both fluent and yet often challenging games. This game seriously feels like a game I would buy off the app store. The ""fluent"" controls litterally feel like your character is wind dancing as well as looking like a dopey ballerina. When the game decides to ""switch gears"" and decides to become a third person shooter it feels like a clunckier Gears of War. Of course this is suppose to mix things up but both styles are incredibly unpolished and really you can just shoot your way through sword fights. Their is no english language which I don't have a problem with but it may make the story a little hard to follow for others. Also the visuals are horrid with little detail.

And when you reach main city square in game, that feeling only strenghtens. But thats it, game creators are not responsible for politics.Game itself is hard, brutal, but fun. Meele combat looks great, seems like motion capture team worked with skilled swordsman. Shooting is middle level, could be better, if you can use cover as your enemies. Weapons looks good and do their job, you'll often find yourself running back half map for shotgun or rocket launcher, which you dropped and bam! Few minutes later it would be lifesaver.Leveldesign is really great. Destroyed city reminds me of Stalker and Half-Life 2, laboratory is mix between Deadspace and Alien movie. Bossfights have two levels - hard and easy. First and last boss are hell, because you need timing, skill and little bit of luck. The rest of them are only time consuming obstacles. And some of the bosses become common enemies - for example worm...Cons? Yep, game have few - saving system, which should work better if was normal saving allowed. Than the cover using by enemies. OK, no problem, they don't want to be easy targets, but why can't main character do the same? And that's all folks ~_^I recommend this game, if you want to experience 3rd person action with another look and interesting story. I found myself wondering, how the game would be succesful, if main character had japaneese name and the story would take place in Tokyo..."

The gameplay is pretty standard third person shooter, things that bothered me the most were:- Not being able to move while crouched made using cover almost pointless- Blocking melee is not very effective since you get mobbed by 3 or 4 melee enemies- All enemies are pretty much bullet sponges, it takes a crazy amount of ammo to kill even standard opponents.- While the game mostly sticks to the third person shooter formula, occasionally it throws you into some annoying platforming which feels incredibly out of place and is made difficult by the not-so-great jumping mechanics.The story line is kind of generic but its interesting enough, i liked the characters. Despite the issues with gameplay, i think this game is worth getting on sale; i dont think it worth paying full price for this....."
