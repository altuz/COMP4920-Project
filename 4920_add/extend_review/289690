We had an O.K. time.But, what made the first game amazing in my eyes is not present in this game. And really, they're the only things this game does; the puzzles and the shooting.The first game in this series was an extremely refreshing twin stick shooter/puzzler. The shooting was incredibly solid and the puzzles were INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS. This new Lara Croft twin stick shooter is shorter, the combat is easier, and the puzzles are also easier, less impactful, and recycled from the first game. In the end, this game is about 1/3 the length of the first. Less shooting. Less puzzles. Less fun.I just want to mention the puzzles one last time. I want to do this because the first game took me by surprise. Your characters have limited abilities but the developers were able to create unique, well thought out puzzles around those abilities. There were points in the first game where me and my friend would have to stop and reconsider the uses of our abilities to figure out puzzles. Again, the puzzles in the first were really well designed. I played this new game with that same friend and we breezed through this game in a matter of days. Such a short disappointing game.If you have not played the first game in this series, go grab a friend and play that game. Enjoy that unique co-op experience. Savour that game though because it is one of a kind and you will not find that experience again especially in this game."

Well, if this is the case, then I and my friend were both spectacularly unlucky! This really does seem to be broken.We bought the game to play cooperatively, online, on two machines with different specs. Both were well above minimum spec, and yet the issues we found were:* Game displays black screen instead of menus etc. (one machine; found a work-around on the forums - this seems to be a common problem)* Painfully slow frame rate (both machines, frequently)* Cut scene dialogue gets out of sync (one machine)* Cut scene dialogue refers to plural people when addressing single person (both machines, single player)* Game inserts second character into game for no apparent reason (seen once, one machine)* Game ceases to recognise XBox360 controller (one machine, once)* Control of characters sluggish (both machines, always)Those were all encountered in ""2 hours"" of ""play"". When I say ""2 hours"" of ""play"" I actually logged 29 minutes playing, and spent the rest of the two hours online looking for solutions to these problems (only one viable work around to one issue found in that time - not a good use of an evening.)This game is *great* as an explanation of why a lot of people pirate games before purchasing them - publishers do themselves no favours releasing games this ""temperamental"" (tactful description) and Steam does itself no favours selling it.Whether it's great (or even good) in any other sense, we couldn't say, as it was basically unplayable on both machines."

The PC port is a mess however. I experienced numerous glitches when playing co-op online. I'm glad that this was a free game on PS+ in August of 2015 so I can play it on the console instead. I suggest that other fans do the same.Edit: I played the game on PS4 and the same bugs exists there too. During online co-op the other player often glitches, falls of the map, can warp through obstacles, sees items that are not there etc.Unless this game is patched, I cannot recomment it in any form."

If you have FPS issues then try turning SMAA off or turning the setting down.  The season pass content that is included is pretty lame and not really worth it.  It doesn't add seperate achievements btw if you care about that sort of thing.Maybe a bit expensive in a sale if you want all the content, though it's definetely worth it and a lot of fun if you plan to play it coop (up to 4 players).  The puzzles dynamically change depending on how many players have joined, which is pretty neat and changes the game up for different playthroughs to keep it fresh."

,Recommended,289690,13290343,"Posted: 8 December, 2014",all,Blue Jean V. Debs,"So, I've only played a limited amount of this game, but due to the fact that it just came out, people are obviously going to want some impressions. Also, please note that earlier today I played around the first third of Guardian of Light so I would be prepared to compare the progress made on this game.TL;DR This game improves on GoL in literally every respect, rendering its predecessor almost obsolete in the process. Breathtaking visuals, refined gameplay, larger and more diverse areas/puzzles, more enemies supported on screen at the same time than GoL really ever managed, 4-player drop in/drop out with public matchmaking support, all for the lowly price of twenty dollars. Avoid using SSAA, as it seems to have very little impact on visual fidelity, make sure you plug in your gamepad, and I can almost promise you will enjoy this game.*REVIEW STARTS HERE*First, the negative (and trust me, there isn't much).-Bad keyboard controls return. The scheme is similar to the first game, and for many that will be a bad thing. Keyboard controls just feel unresponsive and awkward, especially since the way Lara gradually turns while running seems to be designed for an analog stick. Get a controller for this game or you will have a suboptimal experience.-PERFORMANCE. Okay, I've been seeing some initial feedback saying the performance is not very good. I was worried about this (I have an R9 290x Gaming, i5 4670, and 16 GB Ballistix) because nothing frustrates me more than poor optimization when I have a fairly nice rig. After glancing at the video options, I immediately noticed what the issue is. This game offers two types of anti-aliasing: FXAA and SSAA. Most people will be familiar with FXAA. It is very low cost but also tends to blur the image quite a bit. SSAA (commonly confused with the much less performance heavy SMAA), however, is a little bit more uncommon and is an EXTREMELY performance heavy and ham fisted form of anti-aliasing that usually looks great. I don't see much of a difference here other than a distinct performance drop in some areas while having it on. On my rig, I pull an unwavering 60 FPS with FXAA on. SSAA on drops the framerate in only the most demanding cutscenes.*EDIT*I feel like I have to add another negative here, if I am to be completely honest. I gave the multiplayer co-op a shot and... let's just say they could have done better. Now, I could see this game TOTALLY being a blast if you and a friend or two get together and communicate. Right now the solo queue is an absolute mess, though. Players drop in and drop out fairly frequently, which halts the action for a few seconds, and if the host leaves then a new one is picked and progress seems to be reset to the last checkpoint, which can be quite a ways away. Adding to the issue is the fact that these puzzles were not designed with four players in mind (it would have been quite an enourmous task to make puzzles that could be completed with one person but challenged four as well). Both Egyptian gods can wield their own respective staves while both explorers have grappling hooks and can use fire (though I've seen an issue where Lara loses fire and only Carter can use it; I don't know if this is intentional). The biggest issue seems to be a lack of communication and ability spam during complex puzzles. The session I was in consisted of one person who seemed to know how to solve the puzzle, myself, who was trying to figure it out but having difficulty communicating with the leader, and two people who seemed to be actively inhibiting progress by messing with switches, dropping mines, and moving the ball of sunlight to places it did not need to go. Fighting enemies with four players is also quite a mess. Fights are chaotic, yes, but not in the good way. Dying seems almost impossible considering the sheer amound of ammunition being simultaneously fired off and mines annoyingly cause friendly fire, which leads to some serious griefing. All in all, with maybe a single friend, this could be fun. Right now solo queue is a nightmare, though.*END EDIT*Now, the good.-This game is breathtakingly gorgeous. I mean, the screenshots look quite nice, but I never expect the same quality in game. This is an exception. From the minute you run out of the temple and outside into the first level, there is an obvious difference in graphical fidelity between this game and the last installment. The smoke effects are some of the best I have ever seen, textures are of above average quality, and the lighting is spot on. Character models look much better than the first game, though not quite as sharp as the environment (which isn't a problem since this game plays from the isometric perspective).-Gameplay is smoother and more diverse than the first game (based on my limited experience with it). While the first game had the gimmick with the golden spear, which was essentially a one trick pony, this game features a staff that allows you to interact with certain normally static objects in the world so long as they have Osiris's emblem on them. Co-op features two players wielding the staff, which does cause problems (particularly with there only being a need for one staff, so the other player is left twiddling their thumbs). Dodging, jumping, and especially grappling all feel finely tuned. It should also be noted that the UI is cleaned up, and the gear equipment screen is easier to navigate.-Level design, I feel, deserves its own category. I have only played roughly half an hour of the game and I have already encounterd larger, more open areas than were available in the first game, twice as many more enemies on screen at the same time than there ever were in Guardian of Light, and very well designed platforming sections. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that the first chase scene in the game is far more compelling and heart pounding than anything that happened in my time with Guardian of Light (and I do enjoy that game, as well).-The story is so corny and I absolutely love it. Clearly this isn't a narrative driven game, but the writers still seemed to have some fun with the script and nailed the ""so bad it is good"" tone perfectly. Lara, as usual, is her sassy self, but the new Egyptian additions are just a riot, particularly Set. His voice is so goofy and evil-villain-echo-tastic that one could almost not feel threatened by him, if it weren't for the very menacing and threatening demon chasing you for what seems like it will be throughout the game (a wise choice to include this to contrast Set).-Miscellaneous: The loot early on seems to possess those classic ARPG modifiers ala ""Debilitating Iron Ring of Major Grappling"" and so on and so forth, which seems to suggest that there will possibly be LOTS of (perhaps random) loot to collect. There is a nifty matchmaking tool in the main menu for online co-op, which is always welcome. Many of the great features from GoL have returned, such as laying and detonating bombs, carrying four weapons at a time, the ammo meter for secondary weapons, and the collection of gems (though this time they can be used to open chests containing loot; a smart addition).Overall, I'd say this game is fantastic so far and very much worth the low price tag of twenty dollars. Furthermore, you don't have to have played GoL at all to understand the story. Think of this like a 007 sequel. Sure, if you watch all the movies you will notice a broad timeline and catch on to some of the more prominent tropes, but nothing stopes you from watching them out of order and still knowing exactly what is going on. Keep in mind that co-op with strangers feels disjointed, but great with a friend. I would actually encourage you to buy this game RATHER than GoL, as this improves the gameplay in literally every area, rendering its predecessor almost completely obsolete. Anyway, if you got this far, thanks for sticking with me. Hope you enjoy!"

Gamepad input lag is distracting, but nothing compared to the crashes and multiplayer synchronisation issues. I haven't seen netcode this bad since the 90's. Players warping off the face of a level, or getting ""out of sync"" - where your colleagues actions are completely misrepresented on your screen. e.g. ""Why are you standing in the corner spinning in a circle?"", ""I'm not"", ""OK, let's try restarting the game... again"".**BROKEN - DO NOT BUY**"

,Recommended,289690,13313505,"Posted: 10 December, 2014",all,Dasya,"If you played the first Lara Croft game (Guardian of Light) you'll know what you're already getting into. A top-down shooter, like Van Hellsing or a Diablo 3 Lite, with puzzles and many enemies. It can be played either solo or co-op (I went through it solo), as puzzles do not need multiple people to solve.Like the last game, LC:TOO is a quick adventure (took me around 9 hours or so with a lot of exploring), with good pacing through the levels, and I thought the level design was well done. Puzzles are not complicated (I think the first game had harder ones), but this allows for smoother pacing, and less standing around. Not a great trade off for some (like myself), but others will be happy for this. Chests in the game provide more rings and amulets to give you buffs (like items in the first game), and you have to spend the gems you collect to open each chest (more gems spent, better chance at a better item).The game is not overly difficult, nor is there an option to increase said difficulty. Like the first one, there are challenges for each level, and after beating the game you can go back and run the levels again to try and beat all of the challenges which adds to replayability. Like it's predecesor, LC:TOO also rewards weapons and items for finishing challenges. Unlike the last game, where you had to select a specific level, the map in this game is designed around a central hub, so you just need to run off to whatever tomb you want to take another shot at.I have seen some complaints on the forums of high end gaming rigs having issues running the game. My specs are average (I think) and are as follows:CPU: i5 2500k (quad core 3.2GHz - not overclocked)RAM: 8GBGPU: Radeon HD 7777Ran the game on High settings (which it defaulted me to), and only once did it noticably slow down, but it was only for a couple seconds.All in all, the game is a fun romp through a bunch of tombs. I think that's the key thing with this game. It's not challenging. It's not revolutionary. It's just good, simple, fun."

It's glitchy as all heck and instead of being about puzzles that make you think like the first game, this one makes you frustrated because the controls don't work like they should.

OK then, I bought it for my wife as well, but system requirements are increased compared to the first game and it doesn't run on her laptop. Again, local co-op doesn't work properly. Would they pull that off on the PS4? I don't think so. Considering the greatest puzzles in Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light were co-op only, this is a huge deal breaker. Also, the character's abilities are worse (in terms of puzzle & interactive potential) than the ones in the first game.I feel terrible for giving a Lara Croft game a negative review, but they really treated their customers badly with this one. Sadly, it probably has nothing to do with the work of the game team and everything to do with politics and corporate mediocrity. With that said, I recommend that you play Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light (the previous game before this one), and play it with a friend until the very end, it gets better and better."

And I say that respectfully, as I loved Guardian of Light and Tomb Raider ‘13. The stellar design and art direction of GOL is missing here, however, dipping the Lara Croft franchise into generic adventure murk with such decidedly sloppy execution. And while a patch may rectify technical problems, this was phoned in as a whole; it’s clear the studio’s attention is elsewhere.I Paid: $20Worth: $5Good:• Exponentially more fun with more players.• Mechanically sound enough to enjoy.• Egyptian theme works.Bad:• Single player suffers due to co-op emphasis, with brain-dead puzzles.• Enemies flash a bright white when hit, resembling a mid-90’s arcade shooter.• Visual cues abound when your character’s power meter is full: the HUD animates annoyingly, your character emanates particle effects while idle, and your weapon’s effects change accordingly (as they should).•Technically demanding, despite being decidedly last-gen. No single area feels like optimized code.Worse:• Environmental detail exceeds the limits of an isometric vantage point, and as a result breakables and hazards get lost in the intricacy. It’s as though the camera was ripped from a third-person view and perched high above, with no tweaking of the assets from the new distance.• The world has no sense of location. You never quite know where you are or should be, despite being constantly told by the HUD and never feeling lost. The tombs feel like the overworld rather than a contained level, causing confusion as to what challenges or collectibles you should be pursuing. Progress and a sense of completion feel oddly disjointed, and then suddenly, you’re at the end. It never gels.• Loot system is just terrible, and not worth the incentive.Advice for buyers:Turn off the ridiculous Depth of Field effect; it’s completely wrong for this style of game and hinders play – a classic example of the industry’s “filter over function” problem.BFG (Busy Father Gamer)"

This is an action puzzle platformer/twin stick shooter from an isometric view.I say these are the more pure form of tomb raiding compared to the 3rd person action games because they seem to focus more on puzzle solving, of course there is still action and boss battles but these isometric physics based puzzles take you back to a time when puzzle solving was the main draw. But on top of that the action feels really good, really smooth.Now before anyone goes crazy the reason this game is getting mixed reviews is because its very poorly optimized, it hitches all over the place. Frame drops every ten steps. If you have the ability to play this in a non ported version, I'd do that. But if like me you do not have another device to play this on. The technical issues can be overlooked. The game still feels really good. The hitching is not desirable, it is definitely an issue. I by no means encourage this behavior and do not advocate this level of tolerance from developers or publishers but it the game remains quite playable indeed.There is a main map that has entrances to multiple tombs in your quest to reassemble Osiris. Filled with extra challenges throughout. Weapon upgrades, rings and amulet slots to alter the properties your your abilities and items. You can also play up to 4 player co-op. I did not attempt to use this feature as I prefer to play alone. Though I would guess from how I solved some of the puzzles the co-op seems a little unnecessary and perhaps a bit chaotic.

Hullo?I played Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light on my own and in co-op with my sister. Both times it was a lot of fun. When they announced they were making another one of this series I was pleasantly surprised. Months and months ago we bought this one in one of the earlier deals for a 10er or something.What stupid ♥♥♥♥s we were…First thing I noticed was the horrendous performance with frequent framerate drops down to 35-40 on a GTX 970 OC. A 970! But never mind that. The amazing thing, really, is this: After an hour of playing I literally don’t know how the game is because it doesn’t save. Or rather it does save but doesn’t load the saves. I played the first level three times and now I’m done. Which is kind of sad because, from the twenty minutes of level I’ve seen, this looks like more of what I liked in the first game.According to the forums this save bug is rampant, is well known by Sqeenix, by Crystal Dynamix and by Nixxes $hitware and was even addressed by some devs a couple of times in said forums but nothing has been done. Nothing! No patch, no official workaround, no announcements, no nothing. There are some weird sometimes working, sometimes not working and sometimes suddenly stopping to work workarounds from the community but, you know, ♥♥♥♥ that♥♥♥♥♥♥ I will not reinstall Steam on C drive or do some savegame ballet every time I start the game or boot my computer.I normally don’t even think about doing refunds when I buy a bad game but this is something else.

The question is if I can get up the energy to fight battles with Valve over this since I bought it long before the new refund policy.So in conclusion in this state this game is worth less than♥♥♥♥♥♥ And since this state will probably be the state the game will remain in the game will never be of any worth at all. Never. Ever.Also: ♥♥♥♥ Squeenix for conning people out of their money. Nobody can tell me they didn't know about the savegame issue beforehand or didn't deliberately decide not to fix it.

The game seems quite taxing on the system - my videocard heats up to 70C even though it rarely goes up above 40C in other games, there are some slowdowns between cut-scenes and lags that make the game unplayable in multiplayer when there's a lot of things on the screen at the same time like enemies and projectiles.The story is plain and dull - you get thrown into underworld and have to reassemble Osiris. Basically its Age of Mythology all over again.Same as in Guardian of Light each level offers number of challenges and rewards for completing them - there's an overall score challenge (based damage you receive, amount of gems you collect and enemies killed) and some sub-challenges like collecting items or killing foes in specific ways. There is some replay value in levels but not much of it.The game gives you dozens of random items outright and even more later on. 99% of them will be completely useless and it would've been better if you could combine, discard or craft them into something more useful. People keep comparing this system to Diablo but in this game items actually hardly matter at all.There are several issues i see at the moment - companions are missing from all in game cutscenes if you are playing alone but you can still hear their voices which results in weird and awkward feeling. Camera in multiplayer is extremely jittery. Basically it tries to follow every single person which makes it almost unplayable and very confusing. They should've allowed to focus camera on your character only. Also characters appear very small in multiplayer, not as small as in Gauntlet but small enough to get confusing, especially with that jittery camera issue.Unfortunately ""drop-in-drop-out"" system isn't that good either - people can't just come and go and level has to be started from the last checkpoint while you are forced to wait on the loading screen. Waiting for 3 players might actually get frustrating and boring.The game got decent controller support. It keeps rumbling every second, like when you shoot or when bosses walk, when you take damage, when you use light staff or detonate bombs. Overall using controller seems quite pleasurable. It is kinda hard to roll and place bombs at the same time though.I can recommend this as a decent single player puzzle game i suppose but if you want to play with your friends - you should probably wait for a couple of patches.Upd:It took me less than 14 hours to complete single player and every single challenge in every tomb. I've got all of the achievements except couple in multiplayer. So the single player is kinda short.I've tried playing multiplayer some more but its really... really bugged. Players frequently crash, items keep getting messed up (sometimes staff gets replaced by guns you can't get it back until you restart). Its also hard to distinguish between players and it takes too long to wait for everyone to load/drop out/start etc. etc.Im sure that there are some more hours left in a replay value, since puzzles change when you play with more people but its just not worth it. You really need dedicated people with decent PC's to do that.Upd x2:Been some time. The game hasn't been updated, multiplayer is still unplayable, no new content, no rewards for ""seasons pass"". Nothing. Changing to thumbs down."

,Recommended,289690,18438779,"Posted: 11 October, 2015",all,Nomnaut,"First, I was a huge fan of the first. I finished 100% of it and unlocked everything. While I dabbled lightly in multiplayer, it was fun, but not a major part of the experience for me.When I first heard that Square (along with Crystal Dynamics) was releasing a second, I was ecstatic, but the mixed reviews had me concerned. That said, here are my impressions of the game:- I love it. I loved the first and I love this one. Everything feels polished and well-made. I haven't experienced any serious bugs yet, I'm assuming because I started playing it many months after release, and it's paid off.- There are some great enemy designs in this. And while not as robust as the first (remember the dinosaurs and jeeps?!), they make sense and play well within the atmosphere.- Some of the level designs are pretty inspired. There are some decent puzzles, though nothing as incredible and complex as the multiple ball pedestals sequence at the end of the first.- Weapons and sound effects are spot on, essentially carried over from the first, but more fleshed out. There is a nice added twist with maxing out powers and adding elements to your attacks.- Plenty to collect, and it's great fun to mix and match gear to get your desired loadout.- I love the isometric perspective, camera work, and art. It's great. Granted, I'm biased as a fan of the first, but even objectively, I found some of the views captivating.I got the game on sale, but as a huge fan of the first, the game would've been worth $20 to me. I like to judge games based on quality, not quantity. This feels like a quality game.Now for some provisos:- I have yet to touch the multiplayer. Coop or otherwise. It's there, but I don't need it. If I want to play a couch coop game, I feel that Rocket League or Portal 2 would be a better option anyway. Plus, I've always felt this game shines as a single player experience.- This doesn't ""feel"" as much like a thinking game as the first. In the first, trying to complete all of the objectives in order to earn special equipment required careful planning and special techniques. Here, all of the objectives I miss on a dungeon's first playthrough, aren't that difficult and have proven fairly straight forward to earn.- The game is littered with these treasure chests of varying rarity that are opened with gems you pick up. The chests aren't one time use either, you can just keep opening the same chests, I'm guessing they are necessary considering all the loot in the game, but it's kind of overwhelming. Every corner of the world map will have a chest. The end of a stage will have a dozen chests. I guess if your'e playing with 4 people it makes more sense (and can be more fun as you race people to the chests), but single player, they are not necessary.- I love the enemie designs in the game, but there doesn't seem to be many of them: Skeleton fighters and archers (on fire or not); alligator warriors, bombers and casters (on fire or not); scarabs big and small. Maybe it's content planning for the DLC, but I would've liked to see more variety built into the base game.- There are some minor clipping issues in sections, like your ball will bounce oddly or shoot away from your. Certain objects can be jumped through (which shouldn't have been able to). But these are minor issues and don't detract from my experience.All in all, I've had a fantastic experience (as a lover of the first)."
,Not Recommended,289690,17525921,"Posted: 13 August, 2015",all,Lord Weh,"A follow-up to the fantastic Lara Croft and the Guardian of the Light, Temple of Osiris promises more of the same in an Egyptian setting. However, this time around the adventure feels less polished, the puzzles far more straight forward, and the co-op interaction stunted.I played through the game entirely in two player co-op, which was one of the highlights of the first game for me. There are few games that fulfill both action and puzzle-solving in a co-op environment. I was disappointed to find that the puzzle design here is much more simplistic than the intriguing puzzles that made the original such a gem. Even by the end of game we barely broke our stride. Puzzles were mostly straight-forward, often requiring very little actual timing or cooperation.There are boss fights with interesting and unique tactics this time around, which felt genuinely fun to experience. It's just a shame this inventiveness never fully carries over into the rest of the puzzles and level design. Diablo-esque random loot systems have been introduced to spice up the game, but instead feels like a hollow grinding chore rather than an exciting ""what will I get this time..."" thrill. Changing a character's equipment will affect their playstyle (much like the first game), but this time feels more prone to chance with the random loot system than an honest progression.The design choice of Egypt is pretty much a go-to when you consider forgotten tombs, gods and lost treasures, and whilst this may be lazy, it is well represented in the game. The story is terrible pulp schlock, whilst the first game was guilty of this too, at least it made it seem fun and like a guilty pleasure, here it feels lazy and tired.If you're absolutely desperate for more isometric tomb raiding, this will certainly hit the spot, but it won't satisfy for long. It's a shame this game feels like a miss-step from Guardian of the Light, rather than the sequel it deserved."

No news of when or if there will be future patches to address these problems. I ain't too optimistic as there were problems with guardian of light too that they decided to ignore."

I went through the entire game.  Didn't crash once.  Graphics aren't glitchy.  There are a few places where the mechanics could have been touched up, but the game is 100% functional.  If they actually built their system maybe they'd know why it's not running properly.  That or buy a decent system.  This game doesn't have high requirements.  Anyhow about the game...This game is different being that it is an isometric version of Tomb Raider.  It feels more like a Diablo game with puzzles.  There are 8 main sections of the map which you slowly unlock.  As you do you can spend gems on upgrades to gear (amulets and rings) which give you buffs.  You also get a variety of different weapons( although throughout the entire game I stuck with the duel pistols).One thing I did really like about this game are the challenge events.  There are obelisks which you can cause enemies to spawn from.  Usually this will fill the board with lots of incoming and in some cases the action can get quite intense.  I loved having to quickly roll around, drop bombs, and constantly prioritize my targets as they ran quickly towards me.As for the puzzles, they aren't super complex, but some do make you think a bit.  I enjoyed them.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes solving puzzles while going through lots of Diablo type action sequences.  My only real complaint is that the game is short.  I beat it in less than 20 hours."

I wanted to like it as I liked LC:GoL, but it's too messed up and buggy, at least the PC version is.The graphics are seemingly ""better"" but the perspective is worse and it's actually even harder to control Lara. Sometimes she wouldn't move at all and seem like she was stuck at a corner because the game expects her to move away from it in another direction first before she can move around the corner, sometimes she would actually BE stuck after she'd just climbed up a ledge or jumped onto some object (and the only way to continue was to commit suicide), sometimes she would run crazy fast and right down into the next chasm or whatever.Also, controls are generally chunky and not immersive at all, and her movements are odd. Contrary to the controls in GoL, there's a constant impression that she glides and slips more than she actually moves, and it's hard to get her to move from the spot she stands in and exactly in one specific direction (of the 8 she can move in), so she sometimes moves too far away into the wrong direction first, or she jumps into the wrong direction.The game also crashes every few minutes, though luckily it autosaves pretty often, so I didn't lose a lot of progress but I lost much of my interest in playing it.The ""puzzles"" aren't hard to understand at all, but the exploding balls in particular and in combination with those weird controls, pretty much made it impossible to finish some of them. I simply grew tired of repeating the same 2 minutes over and over and dying to some weird unforseeable or buggy crap. At one point, I died about 50 times, often just short of the fraction of a second (and yes, I did it the way it was supposed to be done), then I gave up. I couldn't solve it and I couldn't go back or leave the tomb or anything, so I simply quit.Guardian of Light was way easier and way more fun to play, and its ""puzzles"" were a lot less aggravating.Temple of Osiris music was good (as was GoL's) and graphics seemed moderately appealing too, though its engine obviously wasn't made for the PC keyboard+mouse controls. GoL's controls were off-key too, but at least not nearly as much as ToO's."

In 3 player local mode, the boys were using Logitech gamepads while I used the good ol' keyboard/mouse.   I found character movement with keyboard a bit difficult especially when needing to tightrope or hanging from cliffs and ledges.  However character movements with the gamepads were a breeze.I've noticed that other reviewers experienced bugs and game freezing.  My experience has been rather different.  In 13 hours of gameplay we have had no problems whatsoever.  All boss encounters, trash mobs, and puzzle solutions seemed to work as the developers intended.I will note that I'm running Windows 10 along with AMD cpu and gpu.The actual gameplay was quite fluid and well paced.  There could have been more interesting loot to be had, however the weapon upgrades were great.  I found the flamethrower endlessly satisfying :)Weakness:  Don't expect to be hugely challenged.   An 8 and 9 year old were fully engaged, however an adult probably won't break a sweat at any point.Never got the ""Find Match"" feature to actually find someone.  I suspect that's due to a rather small community.This is my biggest complaint about the game - you can only maintain 1 saved game at a time.  I thought when the kids went to bed I'd start my own 1 player game on the side, but no.  I couldn't do that without blowing away the 3 player game we had going.In the end would I recommend this games?  For sure.  It's a pretty good time and for 5 bucks you really can't go wrong...at least while the sale lasts."

I didn't beat the game, but I played it enough to come to a conclusion. That conclusion is: It's just too easy for me.I like isometric games, puzzle games, and short-run levels. Everything about this game is something I would enjoy, except that it feels like it was made for children. I think even child-me would have been a little bored by the difficulty level of it all. It feels like the developers wanted to cash in on Lara Croft's ample...brand recognition. The ""challenge"" dungeons actually made me laugh at times they were so easy.Another minor complaint is that I never felt like I needed to use anything but my infinite-pistols. That, of course, ties in to the difficulty level: Nothing MADE me use them. Maybe the game gets harder at the end, but I had Osiris half-built and I hadn't encountered a single dungeon that challenged me. I'm not willing to stick around for it to get harder. I was wary the moment I realized that there were no difficulty levels to choose from.If you want to play a well-polished game that is not at all challenging, buy this. Probably great to introduce someone to video games, but as a hardened veteran of games, I felt like I was bowling with the rails up and plastic pins."

For me it's quite enjoyable. I haven't experienced any major bugs or performance issues. Puzzles are nice, though they are not very sophisticated. With the help of friends you can beat them easily, but on solo you need to work a bit more.Combats are engaging but bosses are mostly easy. The game gives a casual feel and has no difficulty setting (unless you want to complete the challenges, in that case it can be nearly impossible especially the no-damage challenges.) There are vastly different types of arsenals and items you can collect and buy with your gems, making replaying the game not entirely pointless.Graphically it looks nice and uses the same engine as Tomb Raider 2013. Story and casting are mediocre, but for a casual game you might as well forget about them. However the game satisfies me greatly that it uses 'matured' Lara instead of young Lara like in modern TR games. It reminds me how awesome she is as a tomb raider.My verdict: 7/10. Get in on sale if you still have doubt. But as a TR fan, you shouldn't miss it."
