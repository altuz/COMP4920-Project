,Not Recommended,289760,29869296,Posted: 12 February,all,TheFireNinja360,"I am deeply sadden by this game, because I have never seen such a great potential for a game to be something amazing that was never achieved. Rockets does something that few other games do, it takes a concept, simplifies it, and then perfects it. When you play this game, you find yourself in one of the best feeling, looking, and joy filling games you will ever play, so why is it bad? This game may have some of the best combat you will ever experience, but you can do nothing with it. Imagine Rockets like an towering skyscraper, it is jaw dropping, beautiful, and unbreakable. So what is the problem with the building? Well the thing is empty! There is no furniture, no colors, no substance. They have laid the ground work for one of the biggest games we could ever see, but they have left their foundation completely empty. There is two game modes, (Both of which are just the basic battle with different health systems.) one AI, four maps, and thats really it, where as what the game doesn't have is more customization, more single player ability, and ONLINE! Why would you not give this game online, that just doesn't make sense! I hate to see such an amazing game go down in history as just another indie game, just because it didn't give people enough to talk about, but here it is, and here is will stay. The perfect recipe for something amazing that they just didn't take the time to make into a dish."

76561197961494531,Recommended,289760,10003424,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,Rapscallion,"ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is exactly what the title implies. You fly around in a rocket and prove to others who is the studliest of all the rockets.Here's a Quick Look video if you want to see how this game plays. There's also my review below if you simply want a more in-depth and concise look at the game.http://youtu.be/daoI-IMkVk0Let me start my review by saying this game is extremely bare at this point. It only has local dogfighting between 2 rockets, 2 v 1 underdog mode, or team deathmatch. But damn is the dogfighting good. You get three different ways to attack: by shooting lasers that go straight ahead, dropping bombs that fling out your side and are effected by gravity, and finally mines that shoot out your backside and blow up behind you. Simple right? But try throwing that in with high-speed rocket action. Suddenly you have to plan your shots to cut off the path your enemy is flying. Did the enemy drop a mine? Knock it right back at him with a laser and laugh in his face. Wanna rain death on a pursuer? Fling bombs into the sky and try to weave away from the hail of death. It's simply fun experimenting and trying to become the best pilot.And trust me, you'll always know who is the better pilot. You simply can't win the game based solely on luck. You have to dominate your opponent with the tag system they implemented. Basically put, both sides start from scratch, and if you hit the enemy 3 times in a row, it's your win. But if he hits you once, he'll knock a tag off your streak that you'll have to make up for until you fill the gauge in the top of the screen. This means games can end quickly, or be an intense test of endurance between two evenly-matched pilots.Another great point of this game is the visuals. I love painting the cosmos with my vapor trails. Not only does it enhance the sense of speed you're getting, but it also tells the tale of the dance of death the rockets have been through. And when I say dance, I mean it. The music in this game is super catchy, too.But let's discuss some negatives now. Just keep in mind that his is Early Access, and most of this will probably get changed in future patches.*The game is super short in its current state (you do everything there is to do once you play your first match). It's just dogfighting. And while it's good, it might not be enough to sell it at this point for some people.*There is no progression or anything to unlock. Something that'll keep the player coming back for more is always knowing they'll get rewarded if they play more.*All the rockets are the same, just colored differently. I'd like to have different looking rockets just for cosmetic purposes at least. Just something to make me feel unique.*No upgrades to weapons. I'm not talking flat out upgrades that are better than another, but more of something that makes them act differently. Like a laser that fires faster but has limited range. Or a mine that explodes in a larger radius but you can't shoot out as many. Just something to make this game more strategic and diverse would be good.*No online. This will be fixed later, but it'll remain a negative until it's implemented.*No tutorial. Sure it's fun flying around and getting absolutely owned by the AI for the first few times, but some sort of menu to list the controls would be nice.*No options menu. You can't change the sound effects, resolution, or anything else ingame currently.Now while that may be a lot of negatives, most--if not all--of those while be ironed out in the future. So wait until then if they bother you.So to wrap this up, this game is going to bud into something very good. And for the low cost of $5 they're handing it out for currently, it certainly worth picking it up even now.*As a side note, I will (hopefully) update this review as major patches are released or just do it again once it's finally released. Just yell at me and I'll come running to take another look if I forget.*"
,Recommended,289760,9999697,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,hexa,"This game is very fun.. once you know the controls. At first I was very confused with how I controlled my rocket, thinking it was relative, but then I realized the up arrow goes up, down arrow goes down, left goes left, and right goes right. Okay, I had that figured out, but then I needed to figure out how to shoot. Space? No. Shift? No, that's a weird shield thing. Control? Nope. X? Nah. Z? Nope! D? Ah, that shoots rockets. I then started pressing WASD to see what it would do. A shoots smaller rockets, and S drops bombs.Also, my resolution is stuck at 800x600, for some reason. This game needs an options menu, or even just a seperate executable to change the resolution.For positive, well, the music is amazing!! This game is also very beautiful, and fast paced. It has a feel to it... It's great. And the light trails, wow. The AI is very smart, also. Still haven't won a battle.Anyway, this is a great game, and has a lot of potential for future multiplayer, but I feel it needs a tutorial and some options.Pick it up, though, it's worth it!EDIT: It seems the developer added some settings! That's great, he even added a controls page. I'm loving the game and it fixed most of its problems!I know that this game will be also very good for the keyboard in the future, because right now it seems the developer still seems uncertain about the current controls. Hoping for the best!Again, it's a great game, worth the money, pick it up!"

I'd like to see some special one use weapons or shields drop occasionally.In my opinion, the camera comes in close to quickly, its a bit jarring durin the fight and distracting.Overal, It impressed me enough that Radial Games can keep my money.

The devs are listening and are working on the game in a positive way, so im sure that it is headed in a good direction.  The regular game is still a thumbs down, for now, but most of my issues with it have been addressed in the beta version.The beta version is playable for me with bloom turned off but imo its just not the same without it.Changes included in beta version detailed at the bottom..............................................................................................................................................................RECCOMENDATION :  YES :I would wholeheartedly reccommend this game a few months ago, but not anymore.   I am writing this review with the hopes of getting the devs attentions, youve made an amazing game and I want to point out some things so that i can play it again.  I completely reccommend this game at 5$, but only after below said issues are fixed.   Review will be updated as changes happen.Sound: 8/10Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Bloom: 2/10Controls: 6/10OVERALL: 6/10 for now...............................................................................................................................................................GAMEPLAY :Rocketsx3 is a great PvP multiplayer game. Can be played against bots as well.  You can play upto 4 player but the experience is best with 2. You could play 4 on a TV pretty well.You control a ship and you have 3 weapons.  Mines, missiles, and  bombs.  Each of these attacks can be fired one at a time, or charged and released to dish out a devastating barrage of your weapon of choice.Mines launch behind you and detonate in an area after a while.  Missiles launch directly in front of you and shoot forward.     Bombs are like tiny missiles but have no thrust, so they fall off from the side of your rocket.You get a sheild that also functions as a speed boost, allowing you to block attacks or get out of a tight situation.First to 3 hits in a row wins! You can hit yourself and that deducts from your score.Controlling your ship may be hard at first but youll get the hang of it.Gameplay is fast, solid, and fluid.  Matches are usually short but may last longer. And boy are those longer matches tense.   Dodging missiles, falling for mine traps, using bombs to block your escape, a well timed charge attack to get two hits in a row or that moment when you engage eachother in a tense spiral of death.Graphics are great, a very beautiful and neon art style, and the announcer ingame is great. A female, robotic assistant type voice.  The AI is amazing and WILL beat you many times.................................................................................................................................................................COMPLAINTS :I used to love this game. I played it  everyday with a good friend of mine. Both of us have stopped playing this game now due to changes made to it over successive updates that has left the game unplayable for us.  These reasons are :1) WAY too bright. The brightness of the ship burner and particles, as well as environment objects and trails was multiplied by 20.   There should be a slider for this.  I miss the darkened out trails that the game had in the beginning, the bright trails before the christmas update were fine too, but it became WAY too sparkly after that. no reason that this cant be optional.2) Difficult to fight in tight spaces now.  Due to the changes to particles and brightness, when you clash with eachother in tight corners or against walls, you cant tell what is going on.3) Unncessary clutter added.  Your health is depicted by 3 balls around your ship. I feel that this adds unncessary clutter to the game and takes away from your focus.  I prefer the healthbar at the top. No reason why this cant be an option.4) Screen size  : I play this game on my 21 inch 1980x1080 desktop, where the game is just about playable in its current state.   On my  1366x768 laptop though, i cant see anything anymore.5) The background was darkened out to try and fix the visibility issue i reckon,  and it looks plain terrible.6) The pulsating rocket trail. Please no.7) The last life slowdown. Let this be an option. It takes away from the fast paced fun of the game for me.. Totally kills the mood, although it is cool sometimes.  Could be an optional powerup or 5th button...............................................................................................................................................................CONCLUSION :Options are your best friend. Please dont just remove something and replace it with something else entirely.   Some poeple prefer one thing over another.Online play will be coming to this game later on im sure.  On a positive note the UI work is great. Always improving. The music score is also nice.There is no problem in the gameplay , but how the game is visually presented has totally gimped it for me and made it unplayable. If you could provide me with an older build of this game, I'd much rather play that than what is on the steam store right now.I dont have any reviews on my account, but i care enough about this game to write this out.  Your feedback on this review would be much appreciated.  Heres hoping a dev replies or these issues are addressed.................................................................................................................................................................EDIT :     CHANGES IN THE BETA VERSION OF THE GAME :The beta build of the game includes a lot of improvements, which are :1)   A bloom and rocket trail slider.  The lowest setting in bloom is still too high for me, its the same as the regular game.  The bloom slider is overkill.http://i.imgur.com/IyQAukE.gifv2) Tug of war is back!  But if you prefer the health bubbles, you now have bubble size, rotation speed, and distance from ship.3) An option to enable/disable speedup/slowdown  pickups.  Though there is a bug that the pickups still appear in game, they just dont do anything.Other misc things  and comments :   I still find the game more difficult to play than pre christmas update. Colors are brighter? The particles? I cant pin it down for sure without playing an old build again but here are my comments :The pulsating rocket trail and environment objects distracts me.  Also, i still prefer the discolored rocket trails.   The speed boost sparks are something id want to turn off too.   In the tug of war end game timer, white on white is too difficult to see.  Its hard to tell how much time you have left, please change that.No 1980x1080 resolution in the beta build, but thats a minor gripe.A new gameplay feature i noticed that i DID like, is that you can now visibly see when a rocket is charging an attack. Awesome.  But instead of the white lines that indicate this, a colored outerglow or border so that its easier to see?Progress is going well, i look forward to it."

,Not Recommended,289760,11598342,"Posted: 8 August, 2014",all,Multi,"Very early access game right now; super barebones. However, lots of fun to be ad here with the insanely difficult AI, and when online MP is introduced, it is sure to be a blast.Update from Early Access:Gameplay here is still rock solid. The online modes look to be alot of fun, and so far the game has only improved gameplay wise.Visually, however; not so much.Menus have gone from the sleek, minimalist approach from Early Access to cluttered, dare I say ""ugly"" designs. While functional, it looks more like a Flash game from the 00's rather than a fast and furious arcade shmup.This transition is applied in game as well; previously a nice, solid background with vibrant solid colored walls gave the game a minimalistic yet attractive view in game. It made seeing you're rockets and missles alot easier. However, it has since been replaced by a black on blue background filled with squares; while some might find this look to be great, it looks ""unprofessional"" for lack of a better term, once again losing the charm that had hooked myself and others originally.At the current state the game is fun to play, but the stark contrast between 6 months ago and now has left the game looking worse off. This does not mean it IS worse off; real beuaty is on the inside (Gameplay), but the outside layer on this game has turned myself and several other friends who I convinced to buy this title in Early Access off for the time being."

However, the new keyboard controls are ridiculous, especially if you played often in Module 2.

It seems to have a steep learning curve to get to a point where you win more times than lose, and to be honest I still feel like when i win its mainly by pure luck that the AI hit one of my mines.I can see this being incredibly satisfying when your skill level increases to a point where you can actually land the shots you want to to kill the enemy and not just kill them by spamming buttons :)The color pallete is nice, very nice.The graphics style is VERY simple, yet it works and feels like it has to be that way otherwise you really wouldnt be able to see whats happening as things happen so fast.The music is good, but needs more tracks.the price is good for the type of game, I think £4 is what i feel happy paying.Cons:Very limited gameplay atm. The only gamemode available is ""Dogfight"", which is just you against AI. (I am unsure if local MP is working)maybe to difficult at times, maybe a difficulty slider would be good.So final thought is it is a great concept, well executed for a good price. But that is only if the whole game getts fleshed out with multiplayer online, moree game modes, more music, more maps etc. As it stands now I would say buy it if you want to support the devs, but if you want a fully fleshed out game then wait a couple of months and keep checking back to see what people say, as its very light on content at this point and that will not please some people."

But whenever we sit down for a session, if ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS comes up in the rotation it basically stays up for the rest of the night.It isn't the deepest, most graphically impressive, or most content-rich game. But the fundamental gameplay the devs have hit upon is just 'so good' it outshines any shortcomings. The flight and shooting/blocking mechanics just feel excellent and tense as hell. They have added maps/modes since release, which is welcome and appreciated, but even back when this was just one map and 4 players it was still well worth the price. It's probably best with 2 players, because that's how the (absolutely amazing) dynamic camera functions best, but I've found it totally enjoyable with 4 and that's how I usually end up playing it.If you're in a situation where you can get 2-4 people in the same room, and you like playing stuff like Lethal League/Samurai Gunn/Towerfall/etc... this is a top tier one of those IMO."

,Recommended,289760,10139315,"Posted: 16 May, 2014",all,Locke,"ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS probably has the most rockets of any game on Steam. The mechanics are simple but solid. The only officially supported game mode in this early Early Access build is one-on-one against the AI, but there's plenty more planned along the way. There's alsothe ability to fundamentally alter the physics and mechanics via a config fileto tweak how the game is played, which is pretty neat. The graphics are basic, but are beautifully stylized and suit the game well. Flying your rocket just feelsrightwhich is a pretty crucial thing to nail.I was initially drawn by the similarities to Gimbal, another top-down space shooter. That's about where the similarities end though. Gimbal has a variety of different parts and lets you build your own ships, all with a unique way of handling. ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS puts everyone on an equal playing field with only a few tools, focusing on individual skill. Gimbal is a very serious take on the genre, whereas ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is as crazy and flamboyant as its art style. Both have their appeal, but ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is infinitely easier to pick up and play, especially on the couch for local multiplayer.It should also be noted that you should have a controller to play this game. Keyboard controls are included, but the game is designed around the analog capabilities of the thumbstick. It's also far easier to hammer on the buttons of a gamepad to fire rapidly than on your keyboard, though you can make use of the aforementioned config file to up the fire rate of your weapons when you hold down the button.Lastly, it's important for any Early Access game to have devs that respond to user feedback and actually work on building the game rather than using the Early Access tag as an excuse to sell something that normally would be decried for being incomplete. From my observation of the devs thus far they seem trustworthy, so nothing to worry about on that front. If the concept interests you at all, I'd definitely recommend picking this game up sooner rather than later to get in on it while it's still cheap ($5 at time of writing, $1.25 if you can snag a 75% off coupon)."
