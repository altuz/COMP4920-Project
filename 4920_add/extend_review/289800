,Not Recommended,289800,9913650,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,Marcelo Sampaio,"tl:dr - A horrible port of a good game. This version has lots of things missing, and the puzzles autosolve when you click them. The trailer and screenshots on the store are NOT reperentative of this version.Dracula: The Resurrection was, when it was first released on CDs, a great and creepy game for adventure fans. It was short and easy, but had a very good story and great graphics for the time. I was very excited when I've seen the Steam version, since the my original CDs are a bit old.But something's wrong with this Steam version... For starters, the introduction prologue is gone! Yes, one of the best scenes in the game is nowhere to be found! Not only that, but the ending seems to be censored: a part of the ending has a scene missing...Other than that, this version has too many issues that SHOULDN'T be here: the videos are a LOT more grainy than the original ones, and they don't scale to widescreen monitors (however, in gameplay, the game DOES scale, making the transition from a cutscene to the gameplay very unnatural).Oh, and all the puzzles in this version where simplified, and some of them actually auto solve when you click it.The game itself isn't amazing. Like I said before, its VERY short and easy, it has a horrible voice acting, and a weird zoom-in effect when you transition from one screen to another. On the other hand its not a BAD game either. The storyline, while short, its VERY well told, the creepyness factor is very high (a must for a game based on the Dracula's lore). But this new version is VERY disappointing. It looks worse than the original version, has scenes missing, and don't have any new adition.Really not worth it. Better to try to find the old CD version (or even the GOG one).BTW, both the trailer and the screenshots on the store page are misleading. The trailer shows scenes that where removed from the game, and both the trailer and the screenshots shows the cutscenes in a widescreen format, something that this version doesn't support."

It is the reason i like horror-adventure games and i would suggest you to buy with my eyes closed.... But unfortunately Steam version is AWFUL!!!  First of all, the great intro where you shoot Dracula is missing!!! Secondly, the dialogues and cinematics isn't on full screen as the original but windowed.... The graphics, the atmosphere and the sounds aren't that creepy as the old scary and full of emotions game... Also, the parts with the magnifying glass where you see some less important things of the game are missing too... But these aren't the worse! On steam version you can see exactly where there are items to grap, where you need to use items, so you have only to move your mouse and find where to use the right item, something that makes the game very very easy.... On the original game i spent many hours to find all items or where you need to use them something that here is obvious... Finally, you can see where to use an item only if the item is available to grap right now... On the original you could see that somewhere you should use an item you don't have either if you hadn't found it cause you were careless (something that can't happen now cause you see exactly where the items are!) either if you will find it later.... As you can see then you were confused if you should return back to find a lost item behind or if you will find it later so you should focus your attetion somewhere else (something that made the game more difficult)!  For all these reasons i would suggest you to buy the original game on PS or PC, otherwise buy this on sale!  My rate for the original game is surely 8,5-9 cause it's great but for this one will be lower....My rate for this game is:  6,5/10"

There was a version for the Mac and the price seemed very reasonable. Once the game downloaded I eagerly clicked ""Play"" and waited to see the game start.The intro was a lot shorter then I was expecting, seems the opening cutscene is from the remade touch compatible version but I didn't mind as it only got the action starting a little quicker.The graphics were very nice, the controls took a little getting used to and I spent a few moments spinning like a top before I worked out how sensitive the controls were.Still on with the game. I spotted an inn and went inside, a lovely cutscene of the Barkeep starts up and then I'm left in the inn to explore. Except there wasn't anything to explore.No flashing icons to move, talk to anyone, pick anything up. I figured I must have entered too early and I need to go somewhere outside to trigger more chat. I turned around and there was no hotspot. I spent several minutes moving the pointer over every inch of every part of the Inn looking for anything, something that I could interact with. Nothing.I restarted the game and went exploring, I could go to other places but they were all either locked or blocked by a character who just told me to move along. Back I went to the Inn and again no hotspots.I got a little annoyed with the game at this point and went to look for a full walkthrough to see exactly what I had to to do move the story along. They all said the same things, talk to this character and pick up this item. I tried 5 or 6 walkthroughs and didn't get a step further along in the game.I turned to the support forum for steam and it seems the mac version is broken. It does surprise me that Steam would release a game that is known to be unplayable on a particular OS. Why not just not have a Mac version if it doesn't work. It would certainly make the userbase happier not being sold something that doesn't work.In short if you have a Mac don't even dream of buying this or the rest of the trilogy, they aren't Mac compatible in any way.Which seems odd given that this version is ported from the iPad."

It's a fun, if short, Myst like adventure game with beautiful graphics and a intresting storyline that follows up on Bram Stoker's novel.However, these postives are for the CD version of the game. The steam version seems to be a bad port of the IOS version with over simplistc controls that are still somehow confusing, lots of cut videos (inculding, most unforgivably the intro video, witch is still in the trailer...) and what videos that still in the game are in a small frame rather than in full screen like the CD version.And worse of all the game is broken. At one point a door that you need to go through to continue is locked and there is nothing you can do to unlock it thus making the game uncompletable.As I say D:TR is a good game but you would need to track down the CD version to experince it as this version is a broken mess."

DO NOT BUY.I loved the book & was looking forward to trying a faithful continuation of the story, but this game sorely disappointed.  Everything started out nice, with reasonable graphics for a game its age, despite the hilarious animations & voice syncing.  The puzzles had logical solutions & I was enjoying wandering around the frozen environments.Sadly, I encountered a bug that no matter how many times I restarted I couldn't get past.  After some puzzles Harker gets a key from the inn keeper to a dresser that contains a lighter, key & journal.  No matter what, I couldn't pick up the journal, which apparently prevented me from unlocking the secret tunnel to progress to Dracula's castle.  Even using the key & ring, it never triggered the cutscene of opening the secret tunnel in the basement.  And since the game removes items after you've used them, I couldn't open the dresser again.  It sounds like I'm not the only one having this problem.If you're really interested in this, find a different port or watch it on Youtube."

This game was a time killer game for me and it only killed about two hours. The old graphics definitely give some nostalgia of watching my dad play this game, but the voice acting is crap, the story (what little there is) is crap, the puzzles are confusing at times and there is too much backtracking.

It is fundamentally broken and does not allow you to pass beyond the first cutscene. I bought this despite the mixed reviews because the whole Dracula trilogy was on sale for $3.74, but it turns out that's still a bad deal when the game is literally unplayable. NOT RECOMMENDED."

I would ask for a refund, but my time is over 2 hours. 90% of which was spent with either a frozen cursor, frozen game, or spent trying to quit the game (15-20 mins avg each time!) also spent quite a while having to hard restart my laptop.Having said this, as the trailer shows content not present in the game, without stating it is not actual game footage. It is misleading to the consumer and falls into the False Advertising category, so may be worth trying for your money back if you are as disappointed as i am, due to the fact the distributor/publisher is technically breaking the law.The original game is great though. Also try Dracula Origin. Great game if you love Dracula."
