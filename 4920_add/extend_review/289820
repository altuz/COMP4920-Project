There is alot of content missing from this version of the game, the contols are odd and this has to be the buggiest version I have ever seen. I encourage you to buy this game and the other two of the series, but do yourself a favor and pay just a little bit more for the disk, this version is not worth the money."

Do yourself a favor and dont buy this ipad port version.Like i've already written: Its quite a downgrade of the original. Half of the puzzles are missing, the graphics are worse, some bad translations, books/notes cant be read, videos are missing, sounds are different and missing, music is missing and the game maybe CANT EVEN BE COMPLETED because of bugs! There is even a loophole in the game.Dont get me wrong, its still a decent game, but its just very disapointing that they dont sell the ""full"" version on steam. Otherwise my ""no!"" would have been an absolutely ""yes!"""

Different icon, missing object for the story, and the graphic is different compare to the one's they're showing. You figure steam would fix it up and sell it but nope seems like they just destroyed it and sell it to the point where you'd think they're desperate for money."

,Not Recommended,289820,11651317,"Posted: 11 August, 2014",all,MacArthur1880,"Is this game interesting? Yes. Is the story good? Oh yes. Should you buy this game, here on Steam? No. Read on to know why.This game is a dumbed down, simplified version of the original. This is not the original Dracula 2 - lots of puzzles and fun aspects of the game are missing. It's a dumbed down version of Dracula 2. Some quest items are missing also, ultimately cut out to make game simpler.Aside from this, graphic bugs are common, with items reappearing in places you take them. Also, I have encountered a bug where I have a duplicate stuck in my inventory permanently because I managed to take it two times from the same place.Do yourself a favor and find an original version somewhere else. Steam Dracula 2 has most interesting and fun content cut off from it. Why did this happen? Your guess is as good as mine. I played both Dracula and Dracula 2 games over a decade ago and you would do yourself a huge favor if you find the original games (though I don't guarantee a smooth run on newer Windows systems)Lastly, I did not notice any major cut content in the first re-released Dracula, and I don't understand why they have to cut so much content from the second game instead. Does anyone care to explain?"

Played it for about 15 mins and could'nt get the oil can to continue.1/10 Do not buy this version, if you want to play the correct full pc game that is actually fun to play head over to gog they have it."

Yes, this is a port of a port. The quality is worse than the original PC version, game save funcion/button doesn't work, a complete disaster.On the other side, the original PC version is actually a great game. Why didn't Microids just publish that version?I'm glad I only wasted 3,75€ getting the trilogy when it was on discount, because what I ended up doing is downloading the original version for free somewhere else, but I still feel I've been ripped off."
,Not Recommended,289820,11773262,"Posted: 18 August, 2014",all,CloudyMao,"IF YOU ARE STUCK ON THIS GAME:Don't follow a PS1 walkthrough, this game version is a phone game port - it is completable, but you'll need to find another way around it. I cleared this version in just over two hours, so it's certainly doable.I'll get to my negative review in a bit, first some good points about the game need to be said.- Great classic p+c- Classic puzzle completion style- Longer playtime than the first game, 2-3 hours.- Satisfying storyline- Introduction of 'timed' puzzlesOk that's about it - and I would give this game a recommendation, only problem being that this isn't a PS1 game port.The steam version of the game is a port from the phone version of the game, not the PS1 classic. There's no real reason for this at all, it means the graphic detail is far removed from the first, there's missing cutscenes, loads of missing items - the game play suffers massively for it, the puzzles are 'simplified' some of them are missing entirely to make the game easier, and considerably shorter. - It's pretty buggy, making it far more linear than the PS1 version, which may be why some people who are using PS1 walkthroughs are getting stuck - it's entirely completable, which is a releif considering some of the steam games from meridian4 are not. I can't recommend this game simply because the price does not reflect the quality of getting a crappy phone game port.If this were a PS1 port it would be so worth it - but do yourselves a favour, and get a hard copy. I just found some on ebay going for around £3, cheaper than the steam price. I picked this up in the recent meridian 4 sale, which is probably the only time this would be worth it."

There was one instance where there was no point-and-click feature available to me (which, as a point-and-click adventure game renders it impossible to play). Not only was I unable to progress any further, but the quality of the graphics is incredibly bad compared to the first game and compared to videos of this game I watched on Steam before purchasing it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. You're giving someone money to give you a game you can't play."

I purchased this because steam had a promotion going on for the first three Dracula games for $5. I'm so glad I only paid that much because on my mac this game was unplayable. Supposedly there are files I can get off the internet to make it work for me but I honestly don't want to bother and I dislike downloading content when I'm not quite sure what is in it, so I'll pass. I had about ten minutes of enjoyable game play before some glitch stopped me from being able to grab the items I needed to continue on. Save your money."

I played it for a few hours but I stopped as soon as I realised that there was something wrong: I played this game when I was a child and I remember a lot of puzzles that aren't included in this version of the game. If you watch the trailer and other gameplay you'll find that this version is an abridged one. Not recommended!

The costent freezing was annoying, but just go to windows, close the game in the bottom tray and hit play and continue. It does put you back right where you left off.the puzzles were challenging, and sometimes I had to go to the walkthrough. I have learned this is very chopped up from the DVD version (according to the walkthroughs I read). But having not played those versions, I liked it and hey give it a try.Now off to Dracula 3."

I first got stuck in the fireplace view after I picked up a nail and didn't see the poker you were suppose to pickup too, so I quit the game then went back and now I can't pick up that poker in the fireplace or the nail since it's already in my inventory even though you can still see it in the fireplace."

These games are hard. They make you think and analyize every little thing to be able to move forward. Granted, the animation and graphics are a bit on the old side, but it adds a bit of charm, and at times unintentional humor. This is, though, a dumbed down version of the original. Many puzzles missing and several items and sequences. But if you can look past those facts, you have a fun and challenging game that will really pick your brain."

I played the first game and half way through a game stopping bug appeared which I could not fix no matter what. Then I thought ok I will just go onto the second one and barely even started it and another game breaking bug this time on the Last Sanctuary I cant get close enough to a tree so that I can interact with it to get an oil can that is right near it. A simple thing really but without the oil can the game is  unable to progress.  So I am very disapointed and flustered that I let myself but these old classic games and I have looked for unofficial patches to try to correct the problem but no dice none. Well I will think twice the next time old games come on sale because they can be cheap as borsht but if they are unplayable whats the point Robert A Ens
