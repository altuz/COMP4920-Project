Never buy this game.The origional game was fantastic, I love it.This, however, is trash, complete trash.Pros: If I can think of any I'll put them here later...Cons: They took away the animated characters. Now they just sit there... Lifeless.Text bubbles that RUIN the any kinda of realism the game had left.Simplified puzzles from what the origional had. These are so dumbed down a monkey could do them."

You'll find yourself tracking down tiny prerequisites you missed a lot. Kind of a hellish experience when dealing with such a linear game, especially considering it's imo one of the most enjoyable point and clicks I remember ever playing, plotwise.You'd be a lot better off tracking down a disk version of the game."

You can pick up the first 3 of the series for 10$.Secondly this is a good game you should definately check it out BUT get it fromgog.com.Story is certainly interesting and the graphics aren't half bad, but unfortunately it's a cheap IOS version. This isn't the full game and really waters down the gameplay which makes you really miss out on some key mechanics. I was extremely disappointed to see that this was the case but figured I would stick it out anyway as I had bought on sale. Puzzles, dialogue, and danger have all been cut from this release. There are only 2 areas where you can actually die, but given the system for progress you'll  litterally just come back to the moment prior to said demise. As for the gameplay itself it will allude to what you need to do but there were a few moments where I was just entirely lost. Trying to refer to a walkthrough is difficult as they point you to the puzzles that are absent here. There's just too many headaches here to warrant this purchase on steam when you could get the same thing and more from the gog release."

,Not Recommended,289840,13615660,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,dingoes8myammo,"While this game started off promising as far as the look goes, I had a very hard time playing it. These games were known for being puzzle games. Well, they've removed the puzzles from this version. That means you're going along playing when suddenly you hit a snag because you have a feeling you're supposed to do something to progress. Except the thing you're supposed to do has been removed or - worse - half removed. I spent this entire game bumbling through almost-puzzles that made no sense. You better hope you don't get stuck on a ""puzzle"" because any walkthrough you find will be useless, since the ""puzzle"" you're working on will be some ramshackle version of the one from the full game.I was very excited to play this game, but was not excited to experience a game so hacked up and broken it's virtually unplayable."

It lacks some animations and sound effects,and the puzzles are simplified or even cut. JUST DON'T WASTE MONEY ON THIS CRAPPY PORT."

At first, playing the first and second games, I was skeptical because of the graphics. Then, I saw there was a third that was released in better times with much better graphics... AND HOLY CRAP DID IT BLOW!Let me just get something off of my chest here... I REGRET buying this game. It- it shouldn't even be considered a game! No, a game is multi-graphical art that includes puzzles and/or problems to solve, missions to complete. THIS! This piece of trash is a clutter of shredded pieces of puzzles and missions that are incomplete! Do NOT even try to use a guide, you'll get even more lost and confused... because THOSE are guides to the REAL game, NOT THIS MONSTROSITY!I looked up the real game. It is LITERALLY $2.67 (plus shipping) on amazon.http://www.amazon.com/Dreamcatcher-16694-WRP2-Dracula-3-Dragon/dp/B001SSKJB8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1448173681&sr=8-1&keywords=dracula+3+path+of+the+dragonSee? I ain't lyin'!The game is messed up on an atomic scale. ALL of the immersement is gone! Even talking to the NPCs has been watered down to freakin' speech bubbles... SPEECH BUBBLES! This wasn't done in the first two games at all! IT WAS ALL ANIMATED!NO! Just... no.Who did this? Who? And why? Seriously, why?Why ruin a game and take out everything that's good about it and leave this shriveled husk of a... ""non-game"".Was it too costly to just take the entire game and put it on today's modern PCs for everyone to play?Nope, not all.I mean, on Amazon, again, the actual ENTIRETY of the game for PC DOWNLOAD is only $9.99.http://www.amazon.com/Dracula-3-Path-Dragon-Download/dp/B00895AJN6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1448173681&sr=8-2&keywords=dracula+3+path+of+the+dragonFreakin' worth it than wasting hours playing this piece of crap!Do yourself a favor, always read the reviews of games you put onto your wishlist. It'll save you a lot of money.I may have gotten this for less than a dollar, but hey, that could have gone to a much better game.In Conclusion: THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF MONEY.I'd advise you to NOT purchase this game. At least until Steam finds that ONE piece of their brain they lost when they let this piece of garbage be sold. If Steam can fix this and put the REAL PC version of this game up for us to enjoy, purchase it when that day comes. As for now, go look at better games than this.If you like vampire games, go look at Vampire Bloodlines: The Masquerade or Vlad the Impaler or ANYTHING BUT THIS GAME!!!Hopefully you've read this before purchasing the game. And I hope this review helped you to the fullest extent.Thanks for reading and happy gaming to you!"

I liked that that they made the effort to use Romanian names. Compared to newer adventure games where they give you a map, this game actually helped me regain my lost sense of orientation. It helps after a lot of similar games to find something different, and some of the characters in this game are quite memorable and mysterious. I bought the game after finishing it :) - as i really felt it was worth it. Not sure why other people didn't like it, but i think it's worth a shot especially on sale."

I had issues solving thee puzzles, the prison, wall of skulls, and the tile puzzle.It's not really wrorth playing, it's so chopped up and the continious restarting is a pain.I bouth parts 4 and 5. I guess I shall continue on."

Fantastic to play with the help of a Steam Controller, definitely easier than with mouse and keyboard.However a very negative point: a lot of clues and riddles present in the original game have been removed or are automatocally solved in this version! It's such a pity!"

What was Valve thinking adopting this version of the title for Steam? *facepalm*I played the prequels on PlayStation 1 and couldn't wait to finally play part 3 on PC, but this?  Nope, don't buy it, you'll only regret it."

I like being part of a good story but pausing it to solve a tile puzzle or anything like that seems just an annoying way to prolong it. So this version on Dracula 3 was really enjoyable. It has a pretty decent story, much more interesting and twisty that the one of ""Dracula Origins"" that i recently have played, that flowed like a charm.BUT, the port was SO AWFUL! By removing the puzzles, they completely messed up the continuity, like they just deleted parts of the game and stitched up the rest together. The gameplay was a real pain to get used to and not get dizzy, the backgrounds were pretty decent but the characters were extremely low-rez with no lip movment, voice performances were pretty good but they lacked sound quality and the sound was like a 5-second atmospheric music that looped again and again.Did I enjoy it? Yes. Did it really♥♥♥♥♥♥me of with all the sloppiness? Definitely. Can I recommend it to someone? Only if they know what to expect and they are prepered to forgive all the crap for a good story."
