More guns, mods, combine 2 mags with ductape, create tripwires.Challening gun play with the most detailed combat system on this kind of games.If you are a fan of tactical shooters, you really should give this a try.Steam version also comes with an easy way to install much needed community mods (Blue Sun Mod) and patches. See the sticky in the game forum. You might want to give vanilla a try first to get into the story line. The mods seems to make it more sandboxy, not that there is anything wrong with that.I have had problems running the game on Windows 7 in the GOG version. But this version seems to run fine on Windows 7.Update: Game has had some issues. But publisher and mod developer has released day 1 patch when I posted crash log.  One time it was crash and another time it was wrong translation in the mod.I have played the vanilla more than my game time says on Steam, game is new on Steam but its an elder gem of a game."

Your main contract is to hunt down Russian businessmen, and while doing that you will eather protect the govermnent or help the bunch of bearded men with Kalashnokovs to take over the country.Well, this is not a new game. In fact, it was released in 2009, so don't expect up-to-date graphics. Its gameplay is what makes this game unique. It's the most realistic tactical simulator in the world. The closest example is new JA.Second strength of 7.62 High Caliber is guns. There are tons of guns (pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, smgs, machine guns, rifles, sniper rifles) and lots of attachements (scopes, colimators, laser sights, flashlights, grips, grenade launchers).So, if you are looking for realistic tactical simulator with enormous  range of guns - this is the game.P.S. I would also recomment checking out Hard Life and Arma Realista mods. Hard LIfe makes game more varied, add more capabilities; Arma Realista makes range of guns more authentic for Latin American region (how about 20 types of AK and 15 clones of Colt 1911?)"

It has much of the deep modelling that JA2 had that very few recent tactical games have had, e.g. new XCom - which was a great game, but didn't do as much to sate the micromanagement itch of obsessively modelling character states and subtle differences in ammunition types. Lots of weapons and weapon-related stats.Also very tough, as it befits the genre. The stunning mechanic when being hit and the adrenaline mechanic that penalizes your accuracy when there's a lot of near misses flying around as well as other mechanics make life very challenging when outnumbered (which is pretty much always). Even fairly novice characters will hit targets at optimal weapon range if left alone, so you really need a plan to be successful in game.Game has some stability issues (save often - though you'd do that regardless), some interface issues and a plot that doesn't really make sense, but it's also incredibly fun for those who like the JA2 mechanical formula and are compulsive about micromanaging for tiny advantages."
76561198002101271,Recommended,289890,32361490,Posted: 12 June,all,MasterManiac,"It's the gamer's lament: some of the best games ever made are busted, buggy, and obviously unfinished. Sadly, such is the case with this game. One of the best titles on Steam, despite languishing in almost complete obscurity, 7.62 High Caliber is a Russian-made real-time/pauseable squad tactics game with a stupid name and an absurd attention to detail that permeates nearly every aspect of its design.Yes, I do mean *absurd.* Take the magazine out of a gun, and its in-game model will reflect this. You can fold the stock of your rifle, and this too will show up. Your character will even hold the weapon differently, closer to their body. Every attachment will appear on every single gun, which you can examine up close within a special window, even though this is a strategy game and you have no reason (though you do have the option) to zoom in ludicrously close enough to even notice that level of detail in the game. Equip a backpack? It shows up on your character. A carry vest? Yep, and with a few unique models. Armor? Yeah, that too, so long as it's not a concealable plate carrier carried underneath clothing, in which case you won't see it. Put on a belt with pouches and there you go, you'll see that too. And I haven't mentioned yet all the different uniforms you can wear, each with their own camoflauge value. It's like having a box of virtual GI Joes.It's not strictly cosmetic, either. Every piece of gear has a purpose. Every choice a tangible effect on how a character performs in combat. Most importantly, these effects are all sensible, and you don't need a manual to understand them. Fold the stock on your rifle, and shooting from the hip becomes faster. You'll also require less room to point your gun around, which is a big deal in narrow hallways. Of course, lacking the stock means less accuracy and more recoil. Backpacks give you more room to carry stuff, but you can't maneuver while prone quite as well if you're wearing one. Thick armor with added trauma plates will protect you from damage, but it will slow you down unless you've got lots of muscle. Scopes will help you see farther away, but will limit your field of view whenever you use them. Night vision goggles wash the world in green, but help you see better in the dark. Flashlight attachments on your guns throw cones of light wherever you aim, and in later fights when everybody's kitted out on both sides, the evening haze is full of dozens of jumping, darting laser sights drawing grim lines between combatants.On top of this, there's an insane ballistics simulation at work here that really does take this game above and beyond. Bullets are 3D-modelled, and hundreds of them may be flying through the air at any given time. There's surface penetration modeling, and bullets sometimes ricochet off hard materials like brick and concrete depending on angle and caliber. Bullets can split in half (!) with each half hitting separate targets. I once witnessed a stray shot badly missing its mark, only for the bullet to hit the ground, ricochet hard vertical, and hit another bad guy right under the chin. Grenades don't do magic damage, either. They shoot dozens upon dozens of fragments over their area of effect, mimicking their real-life behavior. It's really impressive to watch, and great for the gameplay as well. Go prone and pray as the shrapnel skates over your head in slow motion. Every near-miss is a thrill.The attention to detail goes beyond gunplay. This game was doing character catalogues before The Witcher made it cool. Throughout your journey, you can learn conflicting accounts of various important figures, and these details are stored in your journal so you can form your own opinions on who most deserves a bullet to the dome. Your main task in the tiny, fictional nation of Algiera is to extract a high-profile con-artist, dead or alive, but you have to work with various local entities to accomplish that task. You can throw your lot in with the corrupt government, or choose to work with the idealistic, crazy rebels, or you can play both sides against the middle. Apparently, you can also do things for yourself, try to take the country for your very own. I can't imagine that would be easy. I haven't tried that yet.Where things start to come apart is when you realize this game is an obvious beta. It really is. But now, in the age of perpetual Early Access periods, is that really a sin anymore? The game's got a memory leak issue that ensures crashes are inevitable, but the more RAM you have, the easier it'll be for you. It does seem to crash very gracefully, however. A gentle bump back to the desktop, and a double-click later you're back in the game in maybe ten seconds. Annoying, yes, but not such a big deal as long as you have multiple saves. Since you can save any time you want, it's minor.The real issue is the controls. They're workable, but they take some getting used to. The camera is the biggest offender. It lets you go anywhere, and quickly, and the general feel of it should be familiar to anyone used to working with 3D modelling suites. Problem is, this is a GAME we're talking about here, not Maya or whatever. There's lots of depth and plenty of options, but thankfully not too many keys to work with. You can keep them clustered around WASD very comfortably. I use a Steam Controller, so that alone shows you that the controls aren't THAT bad. Though the *feel* of the game's interface leaves a lot to be desired.Despite its age and obscurity, the game DOES actually look very, very good. A good, unified art style melds well with subdued graphical effects. Despite the primitive character models, the foliage is dense and the jungles look surprisingly pretty awesome. No, really. There's a TON of foliage in outdoor environments, and it looks surprisingly realistic. There's limited destructability in the game's environments, mostly limited to background objects. It's fun watching a guard tower explode into fragments when you hit it with an RPG, or unleashing a torrent of leaves when a grenade goes off in the brush, but you won't be leveling any buildings.But when it comes to combat, 7.62 is second to none. The game's age is a non-issue. This game easily has the best real-time tactical combat I've ever enjoyed. There's no obvious ""cheating"" in the game's design. Everything is based on relatively-realistic background simulation. For example, in a modern game like Firaxis' XCOM 2, if you're spotted, the enemies instantly know where all of your people are. Not so here. The AI in this game only knows what it sees, or the last known location of what it has seen before but is now hidden. You can fool gullible enemies into underestimating your force strength and lure them into traps. Shock and surprise are simulated, so if your camoflagued team suddenly springs out of the bushes out of nowhere, your suddenly-cornered enemies are liable to go into shock and panic as you line up perfect shots. It's incredible. And the more disciplined your foe, the less likely your opponents are to be tricked into such ambushes. Elite soldiers are perfectly content with sitting in an advantageous position with their sights trained and waiting on where they expect you to be - which can also be countered with a high-stealth guy in a ghille suit you left behind to cover the flank.The depth of this game's strategic approach is truly something else. The simple fact that the AI doesn't have god awareness allows you all sorts of surprise tactics. The enemy can surprise you, too. They're all too eager to come jumping around a corner, shooting you in the chest before darting quickly out of sight.Keep in mind that everything your troops do is entirely due to your direction, however. Your people aren't automated at ALL, so you have to be aware of what's going on with everyone at all times. Thankfully, there's time deceleration and pause-anytime to help keep things manageable.Highly recommended."

The inventory is complex and rather interesting. You want to be able to do more than just sling a rifle/shotgun over your shoulder and carry a pistol and some other stuff in your pockets? Well guess what, buddy, you're going to need more than your pants and a t-shirt to do that. Get yourself a vest, bandolier, backpack, whatever if you want to store more gear. You just unloaded a bunch of loose shells from a shotgun and shoved them down your pants and now they're taking up a bunch of room. What are you going to do about it? Get a box for those shells of course! Uh oh, you just ran ou of ammo for your handgun in the middle of combat and need to reload it! Wait, what are you doing with that box of bullets? You don't just put bullets in a handgun! You put bullets in the magazine and then you put the magazine in the handgun silly! The inventory system just pays so much attention to even the most minute details that it's just awesome. It also helps that there's a ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous amount of items, weapons, and miscellaneous♥♥♥♥♥♥you can get.Then there's the combat. To put it simply, getting shot ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, as it should. There's no standing out in the open soaking up damage while mowing down enemies. You get shot, it really ♥♥♥♥ing hurts. Your character can bleed out. Your character can go into shock. Your character can pass out. Your character can drop his gun. Your character can just drop dead from that shot altogether. The same can happen to the enemy too though. I've yet to see any gore but the game's still incredibly morbid in terms of how it manages damage. I've finished quite a few fights where a few bandits and marauders who were mortally wounded just ended up succumbing to their injuries as I finished off their companions. Despite the lack of gore and copious amount of blood you see in games going for some sort of shock value, it manages to deliver the same amount of gruesome carnage and satisfaction games like Dead Space strive for.It's a game that's had a lot of heart and thought put into but it just doesn't feel like it had the budget to support all the great ideas it had wanted to share. If you can look past the copious amounts of technical issues, dated graphics, constantly copied and pasted structures, and poor user interface you'll find a game with quite a lot of potential. It's a shame I can only vote yes or no because this is one of those games I'd definitely just give a ""maybe"""
76561197998925088,Recommended,289890,11916983,"Posted: 29 August, 2014",all,Auspice,"A brutal, unforgiving tactical game with semi-realistic guns and gun mechanics.The real-time with pause gameplay adds real diversity to the value of various weapons: a faster-drawing, lighter gun gets lead on target earlier than a larger, heavier-hitting one. Sometimes you'll want a pistol, other times a SMG or carbine, and others a full-size rifle, sniper rifle, or machinegun. It depends on the situation you find yourself in and how much time you have to prepare. It's a great change from games like Jagged Alliance 2, where rifles were always the best choice. Even in the late game, it pays to have a pistol available.If you're looking for a game that punches you in the face with realism, 7.62 isn't perfect but it's probably the best game out there. No other game models suppression, the faster pointability of smaller guns, and the psychological effect of getting shot as well as this game."

This game fails on the basics of a good game though.Few good points:The amount of guns, the different brands of ammo (Brown Bear or WPA), inventory system is what should be in every game. This game also adds the mechanic of having magazines for guns. So you don't reload the gun (unless its an internal magazine) you reload the magainzes and load those into the gun, this allows for a lot more realism that is missing from other shooting games, IMO this should be standard in games.The Merc system is nice, but it should of been taken one step farther and allowed you customize mercs. Slave Mercs should level like everyone else.The pause system is interesting and different. As a 'gun guy' I feel like some of the timings needed to be adjusted, along with allowing you to do multiple things at once, you can't turn and prone at the same time for instance. It also allows for some time crunching manuveurs. Do you pull your side arm or reload your primary?This game is riddled with issues all over and it really ruins the experience in the end.

76561197973153092,Not Recommended,289890,12970383,"Posted: 16 November, 2014",all,IMBlue2,"I want to love this game.  I love turn/semi-turn based tactical shooters/RPG's.  (and have been playing them since ones like Xcom and MOM, or even the 'Gold Box' series for the C-64 were originally released).It's a great concept/start.  And while the same ~9 male or female faces, and running around to various cities asking tons of people the same questions does get tiring - I am more than willing to forgive those little things.You REALLY need to add the community mods (Blue Sun Mods, SilverGirls mods - Thanks SG & Thrillseeker)- which add a LOT.  But, imho, they can't overcome the insane inconsistent game mechanics.The cameara will drive you insane.  Regardless of the events settings.  No matter how you set the camera settings - you will be moving the camera around manually a LOT (especially elevation).  And you will find that the game will not always move the camera to the appropriate character - even if you have that enabled.  I can't count how many times I've lost someone because they were waiting for someone to enter their view (it's even happened to two characters with one standing behind one kneeling), but were shot by someone in plain sight (and we're talking 5 feet in front of them) because the camera never moved to them or the game selected them.  (and yes - those were set in the settings.)  And trying to view/move into buildings is insane.  You have to get them into a doorway (and if they pause - you're dead) or zoom down incredibly close which then looses area 'context'.  (If you can even do, because the camera won't 'back up' past the edge of the battle field...)Then there's the 'action'.  Or attempting to figure out how to consistenly 'pause' the action when required.  You invariably screw yourself because you go to pause, only to unpause it becuase the game just paused it before you tried to pause it.  (Get it?)  And, you tried to pause it because one of your characters was in 'no action' mode so that you could have another character do something else first, but the moment was lost because the game autmatically started the action again once you assigned a task to the first character. (And, seriously, every little millisecond in this games MATTERS) There should at least be an option to let you either UNPAUSE automatically - or manually.  (Like after you've assigned orders to ALL non-active allies).And then ther's the issue of the computer constantly 'cheating'.  Like ALWAYS being able to position characters PERFECTLY around corners/doorways so that you can't hit them (trying to do the exact same thing) while they smoke your people.  (And there is a 'jump-areound-the-corner', shoot, and move back, but you REALLY need to micromange camera and time for that character, and it usually doesn't work anyway, because when you pop around they get shots off before you do, or because it decides to have your chaaracter face a completely different direction than the previous one, or two, or...  And because your character HAS to turn to face before they START to shoot, well, you're dead.Other irritating items:Characters will die after being notifed that they were only shocked (no damage), or sustained very little damage (head, with helmets) or otherwise.  Have seen no damage hits to heads (with helmets) kill characters many times.Characters could be in the middle of throwing a grenade when a NPC gets near them, tries to pass, etc., and the player character will stop whatever they are doing to move (""pardon me miss, I was just trying to kill the bad guy""...)  AND, sometimes they move back (and you MIGHT be able to stop it).  And sometimes they don't.You will select Snap Shot for speed, and it does an Aimed shot anyway.  Or you select Aimed - but then you can't aim. (And I am talking about tens of times from the exact same save point - not different circumstances).Allies cannot shoot (even when barrel shows it extends past) or throw objects through walls.  Enemies can.  (Even when they are far away from it).Or, you're in a crouched position, and you can't stand.  (Like, behind a bar counter, which you need to - to be able to shoot the bad guys, but thery're blasting your head away meanwhile...)Forget trying to get past the Top Secret mission.  It will take you hours and hundreds of attempts.  (In a bar with 'innocents, and the enemy can get off 10 shots for each one of yours.  You can even trow grenades from behind the bar (ducked down) without those characters getting picked off - or the grenades going everywhere else, yadda...  (I still haven't - and have tried all kinds of ideas, including shooting/grenading first, trying to lead out of the bar, yadda...)And while you can get it at an excellent price, I believe there are other similar games at the same price point that aren't anywhere near as frustrating.This game does have the potential to be an awesome one.  But it needs some serious work.  Save your money.  And your time.  And your sanity.  Especially 'casual' gamers."

,Recommended,289890,28965159,Posted: 2 January,all,cameron,"(note: i prefer the 'hard life' version of this game, despite the fact that iteration suffers from humorous translation problems. being able to customize how easy or hard 7.62 is a big plus for me in hard life)This is easily the greatest X-COM/Jagged Alliance alike you've never played. I am going to tell you why, with a bit history on the side.Long before Aperion was founded and way back in the 90s, Vladimir Ufnarovskiy finished his college degree and proceeded to make his first computer game - Remember Tomorrow (or Pomni Budushcheye), a 4X title with a few unique spins. Sadly, that game didn't really take off anywhere, superseded in popularity by games like Master of Orion and the Russian multi-genre, cult classic Parkan: Imperial Chronicles. A modern reimaging of Remember Tomorrow was released on Steam months ago: Polaris Sector. That game is absolutely worth checking out if you want to scratch your 4X itch.Apeiron came to frution in 1999 under Ufnarovskiy's direction, and in 2002, a free to play prototype of their first game E5 was released. It gained a lot of positive attention, and 1C offered support and funds to help turn it into a full retail title. The proof of concept version of E5 had the foundations of all of Aperion's games: intricate control of squadmates and insanely detailed bullet ballistics. It was a mild success in its native country, but hardly made a dent outside of it. Regardless, E5 has earned a place in the hearts of those who wanted to see what 7.62's precursor is like and stuck with it until the end.7.62 was released as a direct sequel to E5 in late 2007, and improved upon its flaws in various ways. I'm not going to beat around the bush - the UI in E5 is horrid, but 7.62 improved interaction with the game and made it more easy to swallow for newcomers. 7.62 is Aperion's most well known title, and for a lot of good reasons. Have you ever wanted to take upon the role of an mercenary operator in the middle of some sweaty and hot fictional South American country undergoing a civil war? This is what makes 7.62 great, even if it does suffer from bugs. You can obsess over every little piece of equipment you can carry and see how it can serve you best. Combat feels confusing, weighty and incredibly satisfying all at once. Not a whole lot compares after seeing a hostile flop over dead when you shoot him with your hunting shotgun, or tagging mulitple hostiles at once with said weapon. Just about all of the missions in 7.62 in are 'go there and do this', but it's impossible to predict if you'll get there safely because of how frantic the combat is.Sadly, there is a fly in the ointment for just about all of Aperion's games: the meele combat feels like an afterthought, but that's something to expected for an game engine that puts so much thought into how firearms affect everything. Along with this, all of their games are very ambitious and are riddled with bugs from development oversights. Still, if you have the patience and don't mind some bumps on the ride, you owe it to yourself to check out 7.62. A small, but incredibly dedicated community has worked to iron out the most offensive bugs, so make sure you take the time to see what fixes are out there.Another thing to note is that Apeiron provided development and historical counselling when Battlefront was making Combat Mission: Afganistan. There's an extra little tidbit for you if you like the Combat Mission games."

,Recommended,289890,19182810,"Posted: 20 November, 2015",all,Sober Cardan,"762 High Calibre is a top-down RTS game with RPG elements. You play as a mercenary hired to find and assassinate a man hiding somewhere in the war-torn region of Algiera, where a corrupt government faces off against an equally corrupt organization of rebels. Bandits, smugglers, mercenaries, and drug cartels run amok-taking advantage of the civil war to turn a profit at the expense of innocent people. You will have to choose your battles wisely and your friends carefully.The gameplay is good, with a focus on a large amount of weapon variation and the ability for players to choose how they want to apporach a given tactical scenario or situation. Either way, the player will almost always be vastly outnumbered by enemies, and combat is brutal (though in a good, challenging way.) and rarely felt frustrating to me personally. The player is given the option of choosing which side to support (The government or the rebels), which of course affects the story.The game does have a number of issues-there are some translation problems here and there or stilted dialogue, and the camera is uncooperative, especially when trying to rotate when you are near the edge of a map. There are some very occasional crashes.All of these things, however, are certainly worth dealing with, at least for me personally.The game comes with the hard life addon, which adds a significant amount of content to the game, though personally, I would recommend the blue sun mod, which also comes standard with every purchase (and can be activated by going to your properties-->betas tab, and clicking ""Community_patch_and_bsm"" from the dropdown menu. It has much of the content from te hard life addon, plus much more.)All in all, I'd say this game was an enjoyable experience for me."

Knowing what to do, where to go or even what your objective is or why you're even here is a challenge in itself* Terrible AI that makes the enemies either dumb as hell or incredibly overpowered* Luck based combat: Sometimes a character can tank a few bullet like it's nothing more than mosquito bites, sometimes a single bullet will knock them down and they will take forever to get back up, while still being shot at (so it pretty much means death). This applies for the payer or the enemies.* Automatic actions are terrible: the game autopauses when you're spotted by an enemy but you want to pause because pause too because you saw the enemy coming? Odds are you're just going to unpause the autopause that paused teh game a few miliseconds before you pressed the button. Happens ALL THE TIME.

You will need to be resourceful; you will need to navigate your hero(heroine) character , finding good companions and simply fighting to survive. You will need to be well-planned for the dangers ahead, in a volatile world full of bandits, military personnel and organized crime.Combat is a heaven for those who thrive with micro-management. The combat progresses real-time, having to manage each and every person's actions in the squad, more or less at the same time (can be paused). Small movements like simply raising a weapon,as well as firing, has its own measure of time. It changes the tactical nature of combat totally by having to trade-off speed for power - imagine that in a closed confined quarter - it's actually better to use the fast-response type weak pistols rather than slow firing powerful rifles. The same thing cannot be said for large open spaces.Combat is fast moving and generally unforgiving if you face high-level enemies - or make a stupid tactical decision (like throwing a grenade too close to you), or simply get unlucky (like meeting a great number of enemies in open space at daytime as opposed to night). Saving and loading are frequent - if you want all of your squadmates to come out of combat alive.The health system is equally complex as the combat time-mechanics. If your squadmate gets hit in the head, chances are that you will be dead (if you raise the difficulty level), or you will get blinded - which renders the screen in a white-red curtain that renders the person totally useless. Critical damage to limbs and body can happen - which simply cannot be fixed by simple medi-kits; you need to go to a doctor.The inventory system is equally complex and shines, for those who are meticulous at sorting and storing things. It requires you to think about how to carry a wide assortment of not only weapons, but bullet magazines in pockets, on shoulders, around the neck, belts and different type of bags.This a gun-porn game. There are simply so many types of handguns, rifles, grenades and body armor. You can end up being very confused about the best outfit. In fact, I believe the character actually needs to use the weapon for a while, to get proficient (can't remember if this was a vanilla or a mod feature). There are mods which improve the vanilla by a lot (BSM mod and Hard-Life, both available on Steam)LikesStoryline is good an immersive, at times comicalCombat and inventory system (great if you like challanges)A large list of weapons and itemsDislikesQuirky and glitchyDifficulty spikes are at times unforgiving"

Probably because of the ridiculous amount of weapons that you get by installing mods like the mercapocalyse or the blue sun. I also enjoyed the humor in the conversations, I wasn's expecting that. If it's on sale give it a shot, why not."

Most of your time you will spend in super slow-mo or pause mode giving orders. Few minutes of real time battle can sometimes take hours.There are no other games like this one. So I can't really compare it to anything.In some ways this game is trying to be realistic too hard that it becomes less funModern reboot with more polish and vehicles would be my dream gameThings you need to know:DO NOT PLAY JUST VANILLA. GET THE MOD THAT IT COMES WITH (under Betas tab, it will alarm your windows defender, it's ok comrade it is not a virus)Learn some shortcuts, like the ones with using alt, shift, ctrl keys to roll, crouch, combat step...etcWhy I like this game:Huge control of your charactersTactics do work in these game, rushing the enemy stupidly will get you killed even if you have suprior firepowerHuge amount of guns, with diffrent types of ammo and magazines. Can't load 7,62x39 into 7,62x53""Yo dawg we heard you like some guns, so we put some guns on your guns""When grenades explode they also shoot fragmentation which can be deadly from far awayIt lets you choose sides in the campaignThings that suck:It got more bugs than tropical forest1 crash per 1 hour of gametimes on averageSome levels are batshit insane crazy difficult, I played with all difficulties on and I had to turn some of them on in some of these missionsShooting is leveled up by missing and leveling up skills is slow in generalSoviet architecture in Latin America lolIf you like UFO, X-COM, Jagged Alliance, Fallout 1,2, Tactics and games of such nature you will like this"
,Recommended,289890,34762545,Posted: 5 September,all,Spaghetti_Penguin,"This game is awesome.1C Company certainly knows where to find awesome simulation based squad based real time tactics games, first Faces of War, Men of War, and now this? Realistic weapons, gears and ballistic physics, and realistic stats-based and story-driven RPG elements!Most good things that can be said about this game had been said by the top recommendation reviews, I'm just hoping to see a sequel not unlike Call to Arms from the MoW guys where I can actually control my squad members directly and personally in 1st and 3rd person mode and play it like a realistic tactical shooter. Wouldn't that be the freaking dream!.Tip: Download the Blue Sun Mod with unofficial patch from steam beta options, it adds tons of new weapons and gears, and some quests and hireable mercenaries to the based game, as well as stabilizes the program resulting in much fewer crashes than vanilla.《7.62 大口径》是一款俄罗斯产名字挺傻逼但实际上非常有意思的小队作战带有角色扮演要素的可暂停的即时战术游戏，由发行了《战争之人》的1C公司于十年多前发行。这款游戏的画质放在如今也不算破旧，但是它最主要的卖点是其中包含的对真实武器装备以及弹道物理系统的精细模拟刻画。具体来讲就是你的角色（一个或者一队雇佣兵）可以从成百种来自世界各地的真实枪械中挑选装备，许多枪支上还可以加装各种附件如激光瞄准器、光学瞄准镜、抑声器、刺刀等，某些枪的枪托可以折叠，所有的枪支都有可分离的若干种口径的子弹、大部分现代化枪支都有可分离的弹匣，而弹匣与子弹又可以互相分离，新鲜弹药需要从弹药盒中取出，陈旧弹药又可以放回盒中贮藏，如上种种都在游戏中的3D模型上有精确的表现；至于弹道物理效果，就包括了不同口径的子弹穿透与摩擦反弹的跳弹效果，游戏中所有子弹都是3D模型构成的， 跳弹如现实中一样具有杀伤力，子弹甚至可以被障碍物切成两半向两个不同的方向飞去。但是由于是这款游戏的操作比较复杂，需要适应，而且游戏各方面系统深度不浅，它的入门难度并不低，但网上想找攻略应该不难，极力推荐即时战术模拟类游戏发烧友尝试！//ps：游戏本体因为开发不完善有不少瑕疵，而且程序的内存遗漏现象导致游戏周期性地弹出关闭，推荐从Steam上的Beta选项中下载蓝日模组（Blue Sun Mod）与民间补丁（Unofficial Patch）来最大化地解决这个问题。蓝日模组在本体的基础上加强了部分游戏系统，增加了更多的武器，炒鸡多，以及不少新任务和新雇佣兵角色以供雇佣。"
