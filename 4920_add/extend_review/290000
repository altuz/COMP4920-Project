,Not Recommended,290000,12454296,"Posted: 11 October, 2014",all,Mikey C.,"Man, I've never seen a more riveting game that DubWars. This was so fun to play, and the music and art style were perfect. It never felt too easy, and it never got to a point where it was so hard you wanted to quit. This game was the bomb!Notice those key words; Was. Were. Past-Tense Verbs. For those of you that don't know, they had an update, and it SUCKS. The game is way too easy now, the difficulty/endless modes are gone, the game is incredibly buggy, and the art style is totaly different. And, most important, the lasers and weapons are different. That was the main reason I got this game; because it looked so cool. Now, I regret buying it. It isn't worth the price (which was a problem from the begining. $20 for a game in BETA? Really?). If they could do one thing to make this game better, it's this: CHANGE IT BACK. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

This level has a amazing feature where theres 2 ships at the start and whichever ship you shoot at first your ship turns the color of the ship you didn't attack and the ship you did attack starts to aim after only you. But this system is broken because whenever you die your stuck on which ever side you choose your glitched on that side and you have to restart in order to be able to choose the other side, theres also another broken feature which would have allowed you to destory parts of the ships (doesn't matter which side your on you can destory both ships whenever you please), but this feature is broken because whenever you ""destory"" a part of a ship you see a little sqiggly line over the that part you ""destoryed"" the line looks like it was drawn in MS paint, there's also a glitch where your weapons remain firing for 8 seconds after you restart from dying.Eclipse: So I didn't find any bugs with this level but there things I want to comment on.The creepers are finally killable. The new spawning system for this level is floating dungon at spawn in creepers and spiders, but I do wish there was a way to destory these dungon because they do tend to spam my screen. There also these astroids at are floating that can be broken into smaller pieces and smaller pieces and then destory cool system but theres no effect when breaking apart/destorying these astroids and I do hope that gets added in soon.Tough Guy: This level should be re-named ""Non stop lasers"" because this level is full of the same laser spam before at least it was a lighting like effect but now it's just lasers. Also the laser in the center on the level just pops into view the first time it appear and doesn't fade it like it does all the other timesOVERALL: This update had lots of content but it seems rushed, unpolished, and untested and it seems as if they tried to do too much in such little time. But this does show this game has a lot of potential in the furture lets just hope the devs don't add in too much with out first making sure everything works first"

Let's start with some pros:Weapons: WOW, the weapons are extremely powerful and are different every level! They are in sync with the music, which is next.Music: Well, it's Dubstep, but it's good. Even if you hate dubstep, you will like at least one. Mine is Eclipse, but the others are pretty good as well.The Loading Screen: While loading, you get to hear another piece of music, which I have listened to fully, and it's not half bad.Now with neutrals:Enemies: They are pretty cool, but are easy to kill. For some of them, they have ranged, others charge. They're pretty generic.The Radical Change: About a few months ago, DubWars changed drastically. Everything was different but the music. I like the new and fresh look, but hate that they took out features like a leaderboard, gems to continue, and a difficulty.If you're new to this game, however, it won't really change anything.Now the cons:Enemies: There are some complaints I have, like when you press play again, the enemies still on the board from last game are not gone.Locked Playing: If you decide to play a game, don't press cancel, cause you'll be stuck in limbo. :(Varied difficulty: As I said, there is one difficulty now. On some levels, it's incredibly easy, but on others impossibly hard. Not good.All in all, the pros weigh out the cons for this review. It's not complete, but it's worth a try.I recommend this game. :)"

The graphics are stunning and super vivid, the music is incredible, the controls are super easy, and the concept of the game is one of a kind! I sit down to play a level or two for a couple minutes and end up playing for 2-3 hours.The graphics for this game are very satisfying to say the least.  The weapons are so well done, each beat shoots a different type of laser or missile.  I learned pretty quick to use my 2 or 3 major beat drop weapons wisely!The songs that make up the 10 levels are so enjoyable.  I've heard each one at least a dozen times already and still love playing every song.  Some are loud and crazy others are a little calmer and require some serious skills to survive with no guns firing but are all very well balanced.I love the upgrade system, my weapons get better after every attempt at a song. The different difficulty settings make each play through even more challenging than the last!  My favorite level so far I would have to say is Synergy, I can listen to that song and blow up enemies all day.Overall a fantastic game! I recommend this to anyone who wants to play a really fun and challenging game especially if you love top down shooters or dub-step."

You could download a demo and the game would give you 10 plays (until you downloaded again).  Anyways, this game has had many ups and downs but the devs are just trying to figure out what they want to do with the game honestly.  They seem to have found a great balacne point between absolute chaos and a modern day arcarde game.  I would deffinitly reccomend this game for a long trip or even waiting in queue/loading for Dota or League.Pros:The game is starting to really come together and look beautiful.Great song ChoicesRazer Chroma SupportOffline PlaySoon to have leaderboardsSoon to have achievmentsSoon to have customizablityOverall best game to have a great time.Cons:No storyline-Maybe a recomendation for the feature???Can't make own song maps... yet.  (Any osu! players out there?)More song choices would be nice but you have to understand the amount of work put into each and every song.There isn't a software that takes the music and assigns each beat a weapon and an enemy spawning... yet...  In other words, can't use your own music... yet.Overall one of the most creative games I have ever played and can get lost in a single song for hours.  Deffinitly reccomended to anyone. No matter how old or where you live. You will love this game."

After each song, win or lose, you can upgrade your weapons to even more dazzling levels. If you have a controller, you can compete for top scores in classic arcade style.

Now with updates, this game has gotten better over time, but come on, can you guys not put in more than 5 levels.

,Recommended,290000,12465479,"Posted: 12 October, 2014",all,(Penguincamp),"Well, they completely remade DubWars from scratch again, so I'd better talk about this.Ever since DubWars came out, I have been a huge fan and decided that this could be the coolest game ever if they execute it just right. Up until now, they haven't. They were froced to completely remake the game into something crappy and had a huge setback, but since they've rebuilt the game, I suppose I'd bettter talk about this update.And it's MUCH BETTER. Almost a great game now, but definitely lacks some polish. They finally got the upgrades system going, but it's very confusing, since many of the icons look the same and have no description for them. And god, are you going to need these upgrades, because the gameplay itself has become very hard. Fortunately it's not impossible. The weapon designs and enemy designs are great and are put in very well according to the song, and it's pretty exhilarating, though takes a while to get used to.They have a level system now, too. Every time you get to the end of a song, a new one is unlocked. The game starts off with easiser levels first, which I like, but I'm a bit upset because it took me many levels to get to the Dubstep songs I so badly wanted to play, but with patience and practice, you are well rewarded.So overall I feel like this game is going in a really good direction and I would recommend getting it on sale, but right now, $20 is extremely steep."

As a fan of both dual stick shooters and electronic music, I decided to purchase this for the small price of $4.99.This game has been through several different iterations, almost every time i launched it it was different. Recently though, it seems to have been completely overhauled, save the music(which is a shame).In its current form, the game feels too dependent on grinding for currency to use the upgrade system. The levels are significantly harder than any of the iterations i played previously, contributing to the overall grind-y feel.I was dissapointed to see only a few songs added over the 2 years this game has been in development, however i understand why the developer chose not to add more. The whole mechanic of the game is based on each individual song, so you get a much more responsive feel to each level. This being the fact that different sounds correspond to different weapons firing (the mechanic that made me like the game in the first place).However, this mechanic is also the games downfall. This makes it much more difficult to add music to the game, as each song has to be built independently from any others. As well as some songs have up to 10 seconds of nothing triggering weapons where you basically just run around the screen trying not to die.overall, at $9, i dont recommend this game. If you can get it on sale though, id definitely say pick it up."

If you want a rythm based game, go play osu, because it's free and actually relies on skill rather than just being luck. There's a massive lack of visual feedback aswell, you constantly have to take your eyes off the fight to see if you got hit or not.But I guess it's nice to see the devs not abandoning their game after this long, unlike certain other titles.

A newer update completely changed the game for me, and has made it more frustrating than fun.For example: first level is insanely hard to beat, even on the easiest difficulty I could find. There is just way more going on than there was before it was changed. Honestly, a casual mode should be really easy and that's all I expect. Because of this change, I feel as if the game was a waste of money and time and will no longer have a place on my machine.For those who enjoy a challenge, I say go for it.

It'd make more sense if this game was a one dollar indie game that you see so often. I felt like I was playing a flash game. Don't be fooled by the screen shots and video that it teases. This game seems like it was rushed in like 30 min. If you want a fun rhythm game just get Osu! that game is even free.

However, It feels as though you have very little control over the situation.  I understand that you can only shoot when the music picks up, but there should be power ups or something to help keep you alive.That being said, that game is still really fun.  The music is great and the concept is amazing.I'm looking forward to seeing what's in store for the future."

You can still see what I mean by looking at the images of it on the store page.Now, the weapons aren't as good, the backgrounds feel downgraded, the enemies could be better, and in the Break it up level, when the asteroid base thing with the turrets gets destroyed, a scribble appears over it like some three year old's art project.Overall, would not recommend until some improvements are made. If they changed it back the way it was, that would be an improvement."

Not only is there the general awesomeness of the visuals combined with the music, but there is some nuance in there.  Each level has a different learning curve and special techniques that you basically just have to invent out of your own ingenuity and experimentation to succeed.  HUGE smile on my face the last 2 hours."

Rhythem games are at there most compelling when it feels like your actions are in tune with the music, and rather then simply timeing a button press, this involves adding another layer of complexity in the form of weaponry and shot placement. You may actually understand music a little better after playing. And it isn't a 1 trick pony. the art style is unique, imaginative, and varies wildly. Theres a sense of movement and scale that constantly changes. I can see playing this game for a couple of minutes, or obsessively for hours, and having a constant stream of reward and feedback to keep you going. I'm very impressed, and keep finding myself literally laughing out loud when the beat drops."

I am so glad I just got it! I can more than recommend this to everyone who likes those games, even if he or her doesn´t like the music (I am sure this game will change their tastes dramatically :D) I am someone who loves Dubstep, who loves listening to music, so this is MY GAME! The concept is nice, the graphics are nice, the sync is... BEST! Aditionally it´s really challenging, because of unpredictable gameplay (unless you know the song very well). The Soundtracks are legendary, most of them, (I personally don´t like Eclipse and Break it up, but that doesn´t matter at all.) The point I don´t like is that you can´t play this for hours in a row. But that doesn´t mean this game hasn´t huge replaybility.  Seriously, I am amazed of Dubwars!So far to my opinion of the game as it is now, I noticed this here about 2 months ago from now, so I know the ""Original Version"" only from videos. I can´t say (unlike many others) that I like it more, because in my view the graphics have been increased by A LOT,  the Sync too, the weapons look way better now. There are only two things I like more than today: Different ship designes and the menu loop sounding better. Other than that, I can´t be sad about the ""new update"". I like the early access version.It´s time for the last point: Improvements. What I wish for the future are definately achievments, challenges and different ship designes. But as announced, this will be coming when Early Access is over. Other than that it was nice when after and after new levels (featuring new songs) would be added, so that it doesn´t get boring to have only the familiar ones. A nice feature for me, as a great Dubstep listener, was something like a level-editor to experiment with synchronizing weapons to your own MP3´s. Not for publishment like in Portal or Sounddoger + or games like that, but for your own experience. I either would like a downloadable (buyable) original Dubwars-Soundtrack. This could maybe make the game a little cheaper and disable copyright-issues.Yeah, so far to my review, I wish everyone long hours of great fun in DUBWARS!That´s what I thought, honestly. Before it went out of early access. Now this game is only a single disappointment. I remember those amazing graphics, these precise controls and the incredible good sync. It´s all gone.Dubwars was highlit as my favourite game, but the current has been ruined by the developers. If you are one of those lucky ones who have played the EA version, you might understand. The graphics have decreased so much that they are actually confusing, the controls, which have once been clear and precise, do now have a somewhat HORRIBLE delay, so that the new Dubwars has become literally unplayable. I have been waiting for so long and MURA came up with THIS?!? No, I don´t want to believe I need to change my opinion on this game and I am feeling really sorry, but Dubwars isn´t just the same it has once been. Why did you waste this damn potential?!? You lost a loyal player, change this game dramatically or I will never return."

Would firing a giant laser every beat drop make you smile? Then you should get this. It's not easy, and switching between it and ""classic"" shooters like Ikaruga or Geometry Wars can be confusing. But every new level I get to earns several grins as the new weapons show up with the beat."
