No mess, no fuss, no rent-imperiling expense.Be warned: Apparently there are some people who don't enjoy spending two hours tinkering with complex arrangments of logic gates to make a wall-following obstacle-avoiding robot. These people are, of course, utterly mad. This is fun, satisfying, and the very best sort of difficult."

Though you can learn the basics of NAND, OR and AND logics.   It is steep learning curve to combine so be prepared for frustration getting things right.   If you put the time effort in its rewarding to see your bot achieve the goals.   Its also tricky in the build as it can be little tricky to align the wheels I found even with the help."

Not because this game is better than every other game I have played, but because I feel like there needs to be more people playing this so that it can really go far.This game (if you can call it that, more on that later) might be in Early Access, but it is one of the most complete games I've played in early access. I have only ran into one bug that happened twice in my first 10 hours of game play. That bug being that it crashed when starting the simulation. Otherwise everything works as expected.The reason I would maybe not consider calling this a game is because it’s not designed to be some easy pickup and play. It’s a robot simulator, well maybe not even that. It’s a circuit simulator that happens to have robots.If you don’t understand Boolean operators, AND, OR, NOT, or XOR then this game might not be for you. This really did take me back to basic circuit building.There is only a sandbox piece to the circuit building. To use the robots you have to play through all the levels and unlock the components. Another downside is there is almost no community around this game as of this writing, so if you get stuck on a level your SOL. At least for now, I really hope that changes and we see a bigger community.Go play it! Have fun building and then re-building."

The game was very recently ported to Linux and as such I snapped it up immediately, I was not disappointed!The game is superbly well designed with a training area, a sandbox mode as well as a career mode with some pre-defined challenge levels in each with acheivements to complete (like time to complete, no of parts used and cost).  Those levels are pretty simple in the begining but quickly start providing more and more of a brain teaser as you go on.   There are five areas in the career mode and I have only just completed the last level in the first area today! The last level in the first area looks deceptively simple but is actually a real head scratcher when you start getting into the detail.Finding any negatives in this game is pretty hard I would say, it will obviously significantly tax your problem solving skills but realisitcally if you expected a game like this to be easy I would say you need to re-evaluate those expectations.  The only real negative I can think is that in order to progress to the next levels you cannot just complete the previous levels but must also have completed a certain number of acheivements in the earlier levels.  It might be nice to be able to progress to the next level without having to acheive a lot of the preceeding challenges first.  Still its a pretty small negative in the grand scheme of things and it may be possible the devs will amend this at some stage in the future.I would say if you are looking for just a bit of fun with some robots the sandbox area will give you that and if you are looking for a real challenge for the mind then the career mode gives you that.Overall the game is not only fun but gives a great experience in development and puzzle solving skills coupled with some genuine learning about electronics and robotics.  I can highly recommend this game, a well deserved 9/10.Also as a last point if you are a Linux user I can confirm that this game worked flawlessly on my Debian based OS.  The hardware stats on my gaming pc are pretty minimal too so I would say this is a superb port to the platform!"
76561198069403081,Recommended,290020,29855890,Posted: 11 February,all,jdguil,"I have been considering getting a raspberry pi computer and a robots kit to build a mobile weather station (my own 'Mars rover') just for fun. But I hesitate to spend a couple of hundred dollars on a project that I might not have the talent or persistence to complete. Then I saw logicbots on Steam. For a fraction of the cost of real parts I could practice building robots and circuits before laying down the serious money.I am only three hours into the game, but I can already see it meets my expectations. The tutorial is a very good introduction to boolean logic and simple circuit board construction. There is an extensive campaign with increasingly challenging tests, and a sandbox mode to just mess around.Building the robots, and designing the control circuit is very interesting.The robots look realistic, and the building on the circuit boards has a simple but realistic feel. The only thing missing is writing code. The puzzles can all be solved by logic; unlike many puzzle games the difficulty is not created by making you try random guesses. The interface could be a little better designed: it often takes multiple clicks to do what I feel should be acomplished in one. But I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs.I have read several negative reviews that fault the game because there is a small random factor in the tests: what this means is that if you repeat the same test with the same robot you might get different results. This situation is described in the tutorial under the reliability heading, and ways to engineer around it are discussed. The random factor is a deliberate part of the game, to simulate real world situations. In the real world it is almost impossible to control all the variables, so real devices must be over engineered to cope with the unexpected. Personnaly I  like this approach.  This randomness is not just luck, it is a design challenge that can be overcome by careful analysis. However, if you are looking for a strictly mathematical game with no random factors, then you might find this approach to be annoying.I think the game is well worth the price if you are interested in programming and robotics. And much cheaper than the real thing."

In a way its a successor to the old gem ""Mind Rover"", where one built bots to do various tasks in a similar manner.Th basic premsie is, using boolean logic gates, sensors, motors and various widgets, to accomplish a series of puzzles with robots. The graphics are simple but serviceable, but the audience for the this game is probably not gonna be swayed by the graphics much anyway.Its a fantastic teaching game for those new to propositional logic, and great for all the tinkerers out there. My only complaint, and rumor has it its being worked on, is the interface is a bit clunky. But, for an early access game its remarkably polished, Ive only run into one minor bug so far where it got confused after I deleted a sensor.Anyways, its a great game and logic/teaching toy and I can't wait to see more come out of it."

I feel that the user interface is fluid and intuitive, the music is catchy, and the puzzles are damn challenging. Overall, this does not feel like an early access game. That being said, here would be the things I would like to see:-The circuit building is great, but I would like to have a single-click (or hotkey) way to change wire color and see the wire bend when it crosses over another wire.-Once I figured out the snapline feature, the construction building became a breeze. I would like to see a circular snapline so I could place sensors along the turning circle of the bot.-For the simulation, I would like to see both a slow-motion and an even faster ""fast-forward"" button."

Unfortunately there really aren't that many levels and they get very hard very quickly. I wih there was a help for each level which could even give you the answer to finish it. I've played the first chapter and the half of the second and one thing I have realized is that if your bot does not succeed the first time, but you know it should, retry without changing anything a few times, often you will see an even dramatic change in your bots performance. I wish I could give a thumbs up but the mechanics really need some working on and I'd really like to see a better help system on each level."

,Recommended,290020,12392618,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,Jack Draak,"The following review was written long ago during Early Access. The game has improved, with community features such as Steam Workshop now built-in to the game, more fun things to do, and an optimized core for smooth play. This is a fantasic game for builders, thinkers and puzzlers, but don't just take my word for it, read what my former-self said about the game before it weas even complete:What is LogicBots? This is a sandbox simulation where you get to build autonomous robots to do your bidding. The core gameplay is a huge set of 'levels', each with several potential goals. You review your objective(s), then with a set budget and assortment of bot-bits and coloured wires you set-out to custom-build a bot-to-order. The construction requires both the physical conformation as well as a circuitboard with the logic-gates that define how your bot's inputs manipulate it's outputs. Once you think you've got the right mix of form and function, you press a button and the simulation takes over: your assembled bot is thrown into the level and left to it's own devices.Each level's 'sub-quests' will futher challenge your imagination as you work to improve your bot and are forced to dream of more efficient and clever ways to achieve your goals. If you want to play socially, it's fairly easy to export/import your bots to share with friends - the game generates a PNG thumbnail and XML text file that makes it a snap.Although this game is still in 'beta' it has kept me challenged and engaged for hours on end. While there is a steep learning curve for a person like me, the challenge doesn't become stale. I've always been a fan of sandbox games, so I'm sure I'm a bit biased, but this game has huge potential. The developer is active in the Steam Community forums (Fall 2014) and very responsive to feedback.Undoubtedly worth the current $20 buy-in if you enjoy games that challenge your mind. Heck, you'll save that much in solder and wire after just a few bots!"

I enjoy these type of games, and this one has potential but with one major turnoff in its current state, the same turnoff that made Bad Rats a bad game... you can run the exact same robot with making zero changes what so ever and get three entirely different results. It seems the calculations are tied to the frame rate, but when VSync enabled still bounces the frame rate between 60-61 (200+ with Vsync disabled) that 1 FPS bouncing back and forth at different times ends up making the same robot without being modified at all do different things each time.If they can get the Bad Rats issue out of this game I would fully recommend it, but when a game about making minor tweaks to fix issues can not even keep the same results when running the same thing over and over it makes it more of a game of luck then of actually making the perfect tweaks.It has potential, it is fun even with that issue, but I just can not recommend it fully until that gets sorted out."

One of my favorite games of all time has been Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts if that gives you a hint into what I think is fun.I'm not going to call this a puzzle game or a programming game.  The puzzle is ""How do I beat this level?""  The ""programming"" is figuring out which gates to use and how to wire them up.Here's what I do like:* It's an objective based robot creator!  It makes you use your mind to figure out how to beat each objective.* There are tons of parts and logic board configurations that you can play with.What I don't like:* Levels get pretty tough to the point you want to just quit and you can't skip them.* Laying out wires should have been more of a click-and-drag function instead of a click-click function.  It's very difficult to see if the wiring post is clicked on or not.  Click on a post and drag it to another post would have been easier.* There is no ability to do a simulaton senor check without using a ""on/off"" switch gate on your board, which takes up slot.  It is especially annoying when your board is near full with gates and you have to run wires too.  See above for why running wires is not a great method.  If an option was included to ""turn on the senor with a given input"" then it would really help trouble shooting your boards.  A little model of the bot doing the function in the corner would be great too instead of having to go to the actual challenge to troubleshoot.Little story for the last point... I was doing the level where you have to design the bot to turn when it reaches a colored wall.  Thankfully they set it up so that a left turn and a right turn had different colored walls.  If your bot goes off course onto the red flooring you would fail the challenge.  I kept trying to rig up the board to do a 90 deg turn with the gyros, with a count gate but I couldn't see what circuit board and values were doing.  Gist of the logic function I was going for - IF SENSOR IS ON COUNT TO 90 USING GYRO OUTPUT AND TURN THE CORRECT WHEEL AT THE SAME TIME THEN RESET COUNTER AND GO BACK TO BOTH WHEELS ON.  I finally had to setup another set of senors to adjust the wheel motor directions when they went over the red flooring because I couldn't see what the gyro and counter were outputting.For the current price, $20, it's not a bad game.  I've spent more on AAA games and have gotten less play time.If you like a mind challenging game and like mechanics/electronics, then I recommend this one."
