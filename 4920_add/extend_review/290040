,Recommended,290040,10178629,"Posted: 20 May, 2014",all,El Minotoro,"Beautiful 8 bit graphics and sounds in 7 varied games.This will take you back to the days of buying a cartridge multipak and make you pine for the 80s.Much like those carts, the presentation is spartan, booting straight into the select screen. A splash screen for the collection would be nice.Using a pad is great for the games themselves but the game never tells you what button does what. Tip- If a game ever tells you to press tab, it means left shoulder button.There isn't an easy way to switch games, you have to take the game out of fullscreen and quit to bring up the selection menu and I feel there should be an easier way, such as pressing B.The games themselves are fun, some are deeper than others. Gaia-ttack, the side scrolling brawler has local co-op, but the button config looks like a nightmare to play. I don't understand the card game properly but it will probably see the least play even if I did. Each game is crafted with care, but you may not like them all.At the full price of $14, it makes each game $2, but it still feels pricey. Without wanting to devalue the hard work of the devs, the experience feels like something in the $10 range. Maybe steam spoils me and I'm a bad judge, but for the full steam price, I think more care should go into game pad support, switching games and giving the selection menu a splash screen title that fades into the menu wouldreally help tighten the experience and push the game firmly into the $10+ price point.It's still fun."
,Not Recommended,290040,12058534,"Posted: 10 September, 2014",all,Pyrrhickong,"Though I'm saying I don't recommend it, I will say that this title has interesting ideas and it executes some of them well. However, it has glaring issues that prevent it from being truly enjoyable. As of this writing, I've beaten three of the offered games, with one of the others being a card game which has no end and one being a hack and slash gauntlet-type deal that's based more on high-score than completion. The other two I have no intention of finishing.There are seven games featured here, but each will last you only about an hour to an hour and a half from start to finish. Which is pretty cool, I'd pay 50 dollars for seven hours worth of quality content. However, this leads to the issue of none of the games really 'sticking' with you, with one solid exception. I'll give a brief overview of each of the games without spoiling any content, as best I can:-An open-world platformer where you grow into a stronger creature to get more powers to access new areas. This is a cute title, where progression is easy and a puzzle element is mixed in. However, in order to grow, you need to eat smaller enemies. These don't respawn until you have eaten every single enemy in the area, which is annoying. The open world is solid, but the game moves at a rather casual pace. Imagine a combination of Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV, only walking a bit slower and with flutter-jump mechanics as opposed to gravity or speed wall-hopping. Good intentions are here but they don't all come together, and the slower pace of the title really shoots it in the foot.-An action-puzzle game ala Adventures of Lolo, wherein you have to eliminate all enemies and then kill yourself. This is a nicely built game, kind of a Mega Man vibe to the graphics and soundtrack. The issue I find is that, simply, you can easily put yourself in an unwinnable scenario later on. The joy of puzzles is figuring out the next step, not repeating previous steps, which would require a minute or so to recreate. It's a good concept and if you like the Eggerland series, this one won't do you wrong, just not my cup of tea compared to good ol' Lolo.-An arcade action game where you beat things up. It feels good and responsive, hitboxes are fairly solid if strict. Not a lot of depth to it, I felt, but it's a fun distraction.-An open-world platformer that's pretty much 'hey we wanted to make a Metroid thing. Here's some Metroid for you'. Honestly it has a very clever concept, wherein there are three overworld maps and you warp between them as different 'time periods', making for a very well thought-out map system. The issue is that, unfortunately, the game is dull. There is no sense of danger, very few enemy types, only two boss battles (which are both very easy), and no real environmental hazards outside of a few rooms. This leaves for a very barren-feeling map, as opposed to a Metroid title, where lava, various terrain obstacles, and a variety of enemies kept the player engaged. It's... rather dull work, honestly. Which is a shame, as the core controls are very good.-An arcade platformer similar in vein to Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr, wherein you're a helpless creature who has to use the environment to get past obstacles. There's some clever concepts, but like the afformentioned DK games, the main character moves at a snail's pace and can't survive long jumps. This makes repeating segments unbearably slow. Unlike DK and Son, additionally, enemies follow set patterns, so there's no element of action or randomness to react to; it's just figuring out the puzzle and hoping you're fast enough to do it. It was fun through the start, and the graphics and style and undeniably charming, but it grates and I doubt many will finish this segment.-A card game. Frankly, it's just a unique concept that doesn't pan out due to being a single-player card game that you likely won't be asking a friend to play with you.-A vertical shooter set in feudal Japan. If there's a game that's worth your money, it's this one. Different enemies giving different types of shots, being able to reflect enemy fire with quick enough reflexes, an upgrade system, managing your special weapon types, and reasonable enemy placement. It's a bit on the easy side, but mechanics are well thought out and constantly engaging. Easily the best of the bunch.The issue with Retro Game Crunch is that it's a game that doesn't quite live up to its potential. It's very solid, but for a fifteen dollar asking price and competition as stiff as VVVVVV, Meat Boy, and Eversion for 'simple concepts harkining to a retro time period', it really does not hold up. If this game goes to $5 on a sale, I'd say it's worth your time. Odds are one will appeal to you, and that one might even be really good. But I'd wait until then, and not jump on a 50% off - wait for the lower. I love retro games, the entire retro vibe, and I want to see more from this developer, they're smart people. This outing just leaves a poor taste in my mouth at the end, unfortunately."

The individual titles are all enjoyable and some can be a time eater if you start to get into it.  That being said, a lot of the games in this feel as if they focused more on copying the look of 8-bit era games (specifically NES), but not the feel of the games from the era.  This does detract some from the experience.  With that said, there's some entertainment to be found here.  I'd recommend a purchase if you can catch it during a sale."
,Recommended,290040,19897744,"Posted: 23 December, 2015",all,King Grimroc,"Retro Game Crunch reminds me a bit of the Indieszero developed DS game titled Retro Game Challenge, but without the really fun and charming story mode that went along with that amazingly overlooked handheld title.  What Retro Game Crunch does well over Retro Game Challenge however is include a much more fun lineup of titles. This, much like Retro Game Challenge however I'm afriad will go unnoticed by most people.Retro Game Crunch is basically just a collection of individual retro inspired games that all have a sort of NES look and appeal to them. All are completely new and original though, drawing only inspiration from games of past. Most of the games have a nice learning curve from casual to intermediate, with only 1 really having a higher learning curve, that being the 1 non action game in the bunch. 6 of the games range from various action subgenres from platformers to shoot em ups, with a 7th game being a sort of number based card battle game. The stand out title for me is definitley Super Clew Land, a platformer where the main character evolves throughout the game as you eat different objects and play a color match game within the game. Evolving gives you new abilities, such as being able to swim, and break through blocks. Another standout is Shuten, in which you play a sword wielding guy who can steal his enemies moves to use against them. It is also a fun casual shoot em up.The graphics are all nice and have good clean and chunky sprites, and the music is pleasant and fitting. There is also built in controller support, with preloaded mapping that makes sense for the individual games, as well as keyboard support.All in all, a solid collection of games. My only gripe is that the UI does not allow you to exit a game to go back to the main menu, unless you minimize the window, and select quit from the file options. Small gripe, and nothing major. It just would make more sense to include the option to go back to the main menu within the game."

They do some things similar to other games you've probably played but that's not really a bad thing. They're all simple, fun & easy to pick up & play.I'm not going to review each game seperately since the entire package viewed as a whole is better than viewing everything on its own.  Each game is short & varied in how it plays.  One game has you go around eating critters to evolve, another has you jump up platforms & defeat enemies/bosses, while another is a metroidvania type of game, one is a shmup, one is a classic arcade style puzzle platformer, one is a 2 player card game, then another has you trying to kill yourself.  Yep.  Pretty unique, right?They all control solid, they all have different style graphics & color palettes, they all have their own soundtracks & they're all fairly good games.  A few of the games also have local 2 player modes which is also nice.Overall, everything is pretty good.  You get a mixture of short games for about the price of one.  Some games are better than others & nothing is really amazing but nothing is really bad either.  It's all fairly average in overall quality but there's nothing wrong with that, unless you just have really high standards."

These games also strike a good balance between being challenging enough to be engaging, and easy enough to just pick up and play.The best part about these games is the design:- Real levels. Maps are clearly designed, not randomly generated segments tossed together- Real goals. Each game has a definite goal (not just ""see how many points you can get, then try again!"")- Real endings. You can actually get the satisfaction of finishing the game before moving on to the next (no infinite levels or endless grinding in a ""challenge mode"")- Real direction. You learn how to play by being put in situations that let you discover each new mechanic (no big instructions to read upfront, and no annoying interruptions mid-game telling you to press a button to do something)Given all that, I'd happily purchase a sequel that explored another half dozen game styles.Also, there's a card game.Completed or Quit: Completed"

This is the only real indie game from Chattanooga that has gotten any real press. That above all other reasons is why I bought this game.The games:As this is 6 game loosely connected I will review them all bySuper Clew Land: I first played this as the flash game version. That version was incomplete and lacks an ending. This version causes you to leave out of boredom. It looses steam quickly after the original flash version ends. Not really worth the time to finish.End of Line: Puzzle game about suicide. Shows the whole theme idea kind of bite them. Repetative and hard in pretty bad ways.Gaia Attack: fun beat-em-up. Kind of like Super Crate Box, and well worth your time to play.Paradox Lost: While I like Metroidvania games, this never really spoke to me.Wub-Wub Rescue: The stand-out of the collection. A game as adorable as it is brutal and repetative (in the it's your fault kind of way). Here is how adorable it is, the pause menu says PAWS. If only this were polished into a full release.Brain and Hearts: Fine. Sort of a cute take on old windows pre-install games. Can be pretty hard, but unlike Solitare it is never unwinnable.Shuten: Fine shoot-em-up. One of the better games. Fun Japan Samurai stylings, and some cool mechanics.This collection is really lacking in coding polish. The only way to exit out is to press escape then close the window. There is no way to close out using a controller, which I think means it would break big picture mode. I have not tried this. This collection delivered exactly what the Kickstarter promised, as bunch of jam games made of the course of a year. Now the extra time gave the team time to make something better than jam games, but worse than full release games. This is by no means greenlight trailer bad, but I wished they had polished the interface more. The art, game design, and game feel are great, though. You might want to wait for a sale, but ten bucks for six games is pretty good, though. Many of these games are better then some full release games, though. Shows what Kickstarter can really do for Indies."

It took me a little over an hour to beat, but dang it was a really good hour. Reminded me a lot of the Kirby games in art style and in music. The game was decently challenging, but not frustrating. A lot of games that go for the ~retro~ vibe tend to go for blistering difficulty, but Super Clew Land was only a little tough at some parts and was otherwise just ""challenging."" Really well-made and well designed, everything felt super nice. Just by the one game I can tell this collection is worth the price of entry, can't wait to try out the other games in the collection."

,Recommended,290040,10221300,"Posted: 24 May, 2014",all,TonyTheTGR,"If you think this is sold on NEStalgia alone, think again.Super Clew Land and Paradox Lost both rethink the Metroid formula well, first allowing you to acquire your abilities rather rapidly, and then re-exploring the world once you have them. Shuten's system allows you a choice of weaponry through the gameplay itself, rather than some sub-menu; then throws formations that are tuned to one type and not another - effectively letting the player choose their own 'easy part' and 'hard part' of each stage. The level design in Wub Wub Wescue and End of Line take very few elements and do a large variety of things with them which keep the game fresh and fun. The AI of Brains and Hearts is challenging and competent, and yet totally beatable - it's just a player with the understanding of the rules, after all. And GAIAttack is just a fun, brilliant balance between Smash Bros fighting and Kid Icarus-style vertical platforming (sans the screen-wrapping); it's tough as nails! You will Game Over plenty, and just resetting your score is the perfect punishment/compliment to infinite continues, and it's Souls-like bonfire continue points.This package is a ridiculously awesome deal, but not because it's retro. It's because it's freaking brilliant. The only thing it leaves me hungry for is a top-down adventure game from them, since End of Line has the adequate framework for that already. But if all is good, this team will stick together, and continue to crank out the brightness."

I was greatly surprised by the quality titles within this package. There is a little bit of something for everyone here. Platformers, adventure, fighting, puzzles, shooters and even a card game! Each game controls incredibly well and looks fantastic. If I had these games when I was a kid playing the NES, they'd fit perfectly alongside any quality games of the late 1980's.While all the games here have merit, I would say that in my opinion, Super Clew Land is probably my favorite as I believe it is the most unique. The other games you could find similar games if you looked hard enough, but Clew Land has elements I've never seen in a platformer before. A Dr. Mario type mechanic within the game, an evolving protagonist and hidden treasures to find within one large map all make for an entertaing romp with this cute little blob...thing.Honestly if you are looking to regain a feeling of nostalgia while at the same time experiencing something new, Retro Game Crunch is a title I highly endorse. If its on sale, I would definitely pick it up. I hope they make a sequel!"

The collection, while not all perfect, is not only robust but fun to play. There's everything from a metroidvania to a shmup, a Flashback-like puzzle platformer and a rage platformer.Super Clew Land is the first game and, honestly, I don't know if it should be- because it's easily the best. The game's mechanics are engaging and thoughtful and the scale is absolutely perfect. The level and character designs are fun and difficulty ramps up perfectly. It was the kind of old school magic of Shovel Knight in a 1-hour package (10/10)End of Line is a fun puzzle game with some unique mechanics. It's nothing to write home about but, coming from someone who doesnt particularly like top-down puzzle games it was fun enough to keep me playing for a half hour with a colorful pallete and a really solid pacing (7/10)GAIAttack is where things fall apart. Again, I really have to commend these guys for tackling so much and getting most things really right, better then some other indie developers who expert in these genres. But GAIAttack is just not good. The color pallette and designs are fantastic, as per every game, and the mechanics are even fun. GAIAttack is a gradually moving beat-em-up side scroller with a great combat system....that doesn't work. Movement is clunky and most attacks are unresponsive and are never satisfying when hit. It's a beautiful looking and designed fighter that works about half the time (4/10)Paradox Lost was interesting. I like it, I like it a lot but it's first impressions were worrying. For about 10 minutes this game looked EXACTLY like Metroid down to character and map design and it played the same. That being said there is a fantastic time mechanic that keeps things interesting and fast-paced and begins to shape the game an identity of its own. It ends a bit uprubtly as the game has an overall objective that's mostly optional- a metroidvania with an optional completion bonus. It doesnt really tell you when it's about to end though. (8/10)Wub Wub Rescue looked like a fun game but it's the kind of genre I can't stand so I skipped itBrains & Hearts is a really dense card game (that's right, a card game) that will finally click after two or three tries. It's somewhat intuitive but it has such a dense interworking system of mechanics that it never feels like you quite get it even though its fun to play. Think of it like trying to design an original, never before seen card game. Obviously you have to come up with something new but you also have to stray away from everything done before which makes for a complicated set of rules. It's hard to describe, obviously, but I had fun for the ten or twenty minutes I played (7/10)And finally there's Shuten which is a Chinese-legend, ninja toting, shuriken and monster filled shmup. It's really fun and I'm still sinking my teeth into it. It has a weapon-stealing mechanic and colorful boss fights. It's nothing mind blowing but it's certainly above-average and even has some RPG elements. Above all, it's just plain fun (8/10)So, overall, Retro Game Crunch is certainly worth $10 and I picked it up for just $1. It has a view overall problems (no key-binding, launches multiple instances, even some lag in some games) but for the few hours I'll ned up sinking into it and just for Super Clew Land alone I'm really happy I bought this- Highly Recommended"

Collects seven shorter 8-/16-bit era retro games that manages to feel a bit fresh and avoiding to outstay their welcome, with only the one exception. Will expand the review with more titles as I get through all of them.Super Clew Land - Slow but tough side scrolling platformer that reminds me of a mix between VVVVVV and Kirby. With a little bit of a Metroidvania-vibe the player must traverse through the open world collect food to evolve, gaining new abilities and therefore opening up new areas. Super Clew Land is quite simple but charming and offers a nice challenge. Only downside is the last Boss that ended up being truly frustrating due to a slightly too high reliance on random elements. - 4/5End of Line - Cute and quite unique puzzle game where the goal is to die. Pushing buttons and switches and changing through different abilities the goal is to prevent the resurrection bots from bringing you back to life. Charming, pretty and puzzly but with a few too many frustrating pixel perfect box moving puzzles. - 3/5GAIAttack! - Arcade style score attack in this sort of Bubble Bobble brawler. Not really my cup of tea due to the heavier focus on score chasing rather than progress, but a well controlled and smooth looking game non the less. - 2/5Paradox Lost - This Metroid style time traveler seems like a given home run on paper fails in it's execution. Level design and pacing makes for a confusing playthrough that ends up feeling like a game that plays itself. Even though I played for what felt like quite some time I never really understood what my goal was or where I was supposed to go next, but somehow I ended up getting further and further until I just got too bored to go on. - 1/5Wub Wub Wescue - Taking a page from the old school arcade games such as the Donkey Kong series this puzzle platformer oozes with old school charm. And even more charming is the setting where you as a dog embarks (puntastic!) on a quest to save your owner. Sing snakes to sleep, ask bats to carry you upwards and get flung around by monkeys while jumping over chasms and avoiding obstacles. Some frustrating and slightly sluggish controls aside, this is one refreshing take on the arcades of old. - 4/5Brains & Hearts - A quite simple but fun card game that doesn't really benifit in any way from the retro look. No real single player campaign makes this game more of a 1v1 multiplayer affair that's entertaining in it's own right but would be better suited as a standalone product with sharper visuals and quicker gameplay in my humble oppinion. - 2/5"

Retro Game Crunch feels exactly like what it wants to be; one of those multi-carts in which every game is acceptable, yet doesn't feel full-featured enough to hold your attention for long.This is a case in which I feel price heavily impacts enjoyment. 5 bucks might be fair enough for a recommendation. I felt some remorse when I paid approximately 10. The full asking price of 16.99 CAD is completely out of the question.Quick side rant: In my personal experience, its usually best to avoid games advertising any relation to something called ""Ludum Dare"". Even if it won awards.I can give an award to the best looking turd in a public restroom, but you still probably won't pay for it."

Not Nintendo hard but hard (Abundance of save points really makes a welcome difference.)I have yet to finish any of these games, but I've had lots of fun playing.Here's my 5 favorite games:1. Super Clew LandYou control a Kirby-like character, and you evolve your abilities (swimming, flying, drilling..) in a bit odd on-screen minigame. However after reaching your full potential, you can focus on the main game, which feels like an open-map mario or the like. I recommend you play past the evolution stages if you don't really 'feel' this game.2. End of LineThis is a nice little block pushing game, puzzles are fun to solve. Gets harder and harder in a nice pace.3. Wub-Wub WescueReally minimal retro game.. Hard arcade4. Paradox LostFor fans of Metroid, you can travel across three time periods and the map changes accordingly.5. ShūtenA hint of bullet hell, you are a ninja warding off spirits and oni. Nice shop system for upgrades.I really recommend this, it has something for everyone"
