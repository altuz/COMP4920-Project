This game is one of the few in gaming that gets ""hacking"" in video games right. Rather than dumb down the experience to the point where you don't have to be concious to play, Glitchspace takes hacking to a whole new level. With an intuitive Node-based system, you can connect constants to mathematic expressions, multiply vectors together, or transform an object, all with the ease of a mouse drag.The BadThere's just not enough of it! After one hour of playing, I had beaten the game, and was left yearning for more. Given the early-access state of the game, and the number of levels there are, I would suggest waiting until the game comes out with more levels and more functionality. If you just can't wait, I suggest buying it on sale.The UglyThe game is graphically simplistic, but very interesting none the less. The random ""glitching"" of the hackable blocks can be distracting at times, but otherwise the game is very pleasing, both visually and auditorily.In conclusion, I do recommend this game, but would like either more levels, or Steam Workshop level editing capabilities."

The game is full of good intentions, I can imagine the team has worked really hard on that project, but the essential isn't here... Let me explain before going on level design.This game is about scripting the behavior of your environment. Unfortunately, since this game is essentially a puzzle/platformer and that an automatic respawn is set up in the game, sometimes it happens that you have to restart the level completely because you are stuck in a spawn kill loop (you spawn on a place where you can't escape alive). This over the weird collisions on the edges of the meshes will get your nerves really tensed!As well, the ergonomy over the (very complete) nodal scripting interface is really tedious to manage. I'm absolutely sure that some optimization of the interface would save 50% of the clicks...Enough for the not level design part...Despite the rich gameplay, the GD elements have been very poorly exploited. Elements are very well introduced, but we are barely challenged on those. Where in portal, the scheme ""exposition-introduction-learning-challenge"" is well done, Glitchspace stops at the learning phase... The game exposes all the richness of it's gameplay when challenging us very very little.I would also like to add that despite the game's name is ""Glitchspace"", the vast rooms push you to explore, but your adventure won't be rewarded, since nothing else than the regular puzzle is to discover... And for the glitch side, I have tried going over the boundaries, but the game prevents you going out of the regular path, teaching the player NOT to explore very quickly...A lot of missed opportunities... And it is extremely sad.If the devs are reading this, I would gladly turn this evaluation as positive if fixes are pushed into a patch :) But for the moment, it will be a ""no""."

If you want to see more in this review series, check out my Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet Review.I bought this game when it was first released into early access. It looked like a promising idea, but I have been wrong on that before, so I was wary of this game being updated. To be honest, it wasn't the best when I first got it. I played for about an half an hour before I finished everything the game had to offer, then I just kindof forgot about it. When I found it again, it was updated and out of early access, and it opened up to a whole new menu. I played just the ""Story"" mode, which isn't much of a story, but does have a great soundtrack and gameplay. It does have a small learning curve, which I actually like in most games, so it didn't turn me off from it. I overall love this game in it's current state, and I hope the devs keep up the good work, and keep updating it!tl;dr I like this game as it is now, and I also love the soundtrack.Pros:+ Great Soundtrack+ Love the ""Reprogrammable Blocks""+ New and innovative ideaCons:- Almost no story- Small learning curve8/10[EDIT: Changed my grammar.]"

It took me around 4 hours to complete story mode; however, take that with a grain of salt, I'm a CS student and I was frsutrated by some of the earlier levls and how the game tried to limit some of what you could do. I'd much prefered more freedom but harder challenges. It sucked to have to solve a certain puzzle through only a single veiw point. Also the game itself is definitely buggy, like in some of the earlier levels I broke stuff and had to restart, and multiple times I would get stuck in an infinite falling loop because it kept respawning me not on an actual plane so that's kind of annoying. Also it's somewhat frsutrating because their character controller is clearly capsule shaped, making balancing on skinnier surfaces annoying as you tend to slide off. But I loved the last 5-6 levels so much, I was laughing and smiling as I raced through puzzles and really loved that. So I'd love to see a longer more complex story/challenge mode and perhaps more bug fixes, so keep that in mind and try to be patient with the game. Even with all that I'd still recommend it!"

,Not Recommended,290060,34569920,Posted: 28 August,all,Dravvad,"I have been programming for easily over a decade, and my career is in software engineering, so I usually enjoy these kinds of games.But Glitchspace, ironically, is filled with a lot of glitches, and is very inefficient. I picked up the premise very quickly, made it through a handful of areas, and unlocked a few different categories of programming in about 30 minutes or so. And yet, the game's downfalls were jumping out at me.Most importantly, I think that Glitchspace didn't go through a proper QA (Quality Assurance) at all. Numerous times I had the game get me stuck if I hit an obstacle that made me respawn, because the game almost never respawns you in a safe place. For instance, there was a block that makes you fly forward off of a ledge. The game respawned me so that the block immediately threw me off again, and I was in an infinite loop of respawning.Another example was where I was on a block and moved it a little too quickly in a direction so it hit a wall. The game made the block disappear and said that it went out of bounds and was reset. However, the game glitched me through the wall, so I was sitting on an invisible ledge on the other side, unable to move. And if I went to the menu and clicked ""Respawn,"" it simply respawned me at this invisible edge where I was stuck.The last example I encountered in the first 30 minutes was when I tried to explore a little and jumped off of a tall block to an area down below, but couldn't get back up. Yet again, clicking ""Respawn"" simply respawned me where I was, leaving me there. So the ""Respawn"" button is almost useless in the menu as it usually respawns you where you are currently standing, or at a bad place the game code made you go.The only way to actually get out of an area you are stuck in is to choose to return to the last portal you went through. Some portals are not exactly close together, so what this means is that you might have to redo a whole section of an area just because the game got you stuck somewhere. That got me angry really quickly.Next up is the actual mechanics. The game’s concept is interesting, but the implementation is poor. Most of the puzzles I went through weren't puzzles. They were very repetitive and boring, and that was amplified by the interface used to program the blocks. What I really would have enjoyed would have been an interface where you choose a category, then it has drop-down menus and text fields to edit, instead of having a bunch of separate nodes for every single thing.For instance, you can move a block along its X, Y, or Z axis. In order to do this, you must spawn a node that says ""Move Object,"" and you must spawn a node that explicitly says the axis you want, and then you must spawn a node that chooses a hard-coded value of the distance, and THEN you must connect all of them together to finally move the block. Further, if you accidentally choose something wrong, like say the distance, you must delete the node and re-create it to choose another value. You cannot edit the nodes directly to replace a value, but instead have to make a brand new one and re-connect.That interface is so inefficient. In my suggestion above, it would have made more sense to simply have a single node that says ""Move Object,"" and the node pops up a little menu that says ""Axis"" with a drop-down menu saying X, Y, or Z, and with another drop-down menu allowing you to choose the distance. This would have made it quicker to program objects, and further it would have enabled you to actually edit a node because it could just pop the menu back up and let you change a field.Besides the above, there is obviously no story, and the graphics of the game are nothing special at all. Very monotone, really.With the mechanics being so bad and seeing so many annoying glitches so quickly, I lost any desire to continue, and definitely don’t think the game is worth much in its current state. The developers flew a great idea up high and then smashed it into the ground with their implementation."

When it comes to user experience having to redo your solution at times can be frustrating, but I understand it is there to keep you from getting horribly stuck. Some puzzles too I feel I found an easier solution to than what was likely intended. Still, it is an indie game with a small price, so I feel this can be forgiven."

One time I was trapped in an infinite loop where it spawned my character on a spring board and instantly launched it to it's death over and over.Fortunately, none of these were so bad I had to close the game and restart.  And most seem to be a clash of level design with the game engine.  Or the engines lack of ability to handle unexpected moves.  Fortunately, the ""levels"" are short enough that returning to the last portal was not seriously taxing.  But the glitches are frequent enough to be very annoying.  I focus on this because it seemed to be the games dominant feature.  Now, I have played games where a supposed glitch in the game was a part of the intended experience.  These can be seriously good or seriously bad.    But, this doesn't seem to be the case here.  (And if it is, I recomend avoiding glitchspace altogether.

The game looked potentially interesting, but ultimately it became frustating to overcome the setbacks from bugs. The biggest one is due to that your respawn point can get set to a location such as on top of a launchpad or above air due to changes in cuboids. This requires to restart the current level in order to fix it, so not exactly great. Another issue is where you can program a platform to move while you're on it, however, it only sometimes moves you with it and can sometimes result in the first issue. Lastly the wiring in the programming menu can get stuck to your mouse, making you unable to do anything with that piece until you restart the level.

The VR stuff is really unpolished:It has frequent frame rate jank, seemingly at random (I'm guessing it's loading content or Unity is doing a garbage collect). I've got a GTX 970 GPU and a Core i7 CPU. Other VR experiences like Chronos and BlazeRush run silky smooth, so I'm pretty sure it's not my PCIt doesn't launch from Steam VR - mildly annoying having to take the mask off to launch a game, only to put the mask back on seconds later.If you have a rift attached, you can't play it in non-VR mode. Even if you close Oculus Home, Glitchspace will relaunch it. Worse - because games don't render if the Rift isn't on your face (theres a proximity sensor on the Rift), you're left staring at a black screen wondering why the game isn't loading. You have to unplug the Rift completely if you want to play in non-VR modeIt has sections of the game where you have to fall. I can stomach non-VR-optimized FPS controls in VR now, but falling still feels awful in VR for me.Having independent looking and steering directions is great because you can look around without veering off course, but without any visual indication of where your ""steering"" direction is, it's a constant battle between your mouse, your face and the WASD keys to keep your character moving in the desired direction"

The plain untextured environment is okay, not exciting but not distracting. Nice ambient music that also isn't distracting.The game's featured mechanic, the ability to edit and ""program"" different platforms and obstacles is pretty neat, but it feels like a lot more could have been done with it. It would have been interesting if there were more things to interact with, like robots with editable behaviour, or trigger type objects that could be loaded with their own configurations like the gun. The whole ""Story mode"" is more like a tutorial for Sandbox mode, which is unlocked at the end.That being said, I'm not disappointed. It's very enjoyable, though the main story is short. Still in early access, I'm looking forward to what might be included in the future!UPDATE: One little nitpick; the sandbox mode does seem oddly restrictive. It includes many cube platforms that either have their settings locked or simply don't include all of the possible functions. What's the point of having moving platforms if you can't invert some of their movement patterns with a simple negative function? Little disappointing, but it was probably done that way for a good reason."

While less advanced conecepts are simple to learn, more advanced ones, which are not even included in the main game, but in sandbox mode, are impossible to figure out. There is no level editor, just a preset sandbox with blocks in it, set to preset places. This game is so sad. There was so much more that could be done. But once you play it once, you don't have a reason to keep going."

The game was a decent representation of coding and its obstacles. In this game it is literal obstacles that you overcome. If you even have the slightest idea if you would be enjoy coding, try this game out. I could see this as a great way to learn basic logic to solve problems in a fun manner with out the overhead of actually learning a coding language."

Terrible, changing mouse response and delayed cursor interaction lead me to become somewhat physically sick.  In this game there are two primary modes of involvement with objects and environment, and each has a seperate feel.  In editing your objects, you have a highly delayed, unresponsive, mush of a mouse cursour, and in gameplay you have a snappy, quite overly responsive mouse feel.  I attempted to rectify and make this game playable by hot switching dpi from my mouse's built in dpi selection buttons.  This was not a good solution for any sort of enjoyable gameplay.  In the editing mode you will literally move the mouse, and then watch it trail behind it's intended path, delayed by some time, making editing quite annoying.  In game settings do little to cope with this.  The game does run at very high frame rates, which is nice.  The environment is stark, yet beautiful in places.  The concept is amazing.  But I cannot play this game...ever again due to nausea.  And I haven't had game induced stomach-turn since playing Metroid on NES around 1992.  The mouse behavior ruined this game for me, and I really did want to like this one."

Look at all those functions avaliable in Sandbox Mode! However since Sandbox Mode have no objective, people will be less likely to explore those functions, unless they are some programming nerds lol. For now, the game gave you all accessible functions in Story Mode continously and just when they did that, the games ends. It kinda feels like a tutorial lesson, it gave you the basics, and thats it. There is definitely room for more difficult puzzle using those full functions, maybe a future update for that along with user-created contents?I like how the game allows open solutions to puzzles, and some of them are quite tricky due to function limitations. And also there are multiple approaches to perform the same function (I guess this is what programming is about!). One thing I noticed that it seemed the numbers used in the coordinate system are not always fixed: A 20 in this level looks different from the other level. And the game still contains glitches like missing cursor in the canvas and missing pause menu.Anyways, I still recommend this game as a nice puzzle game and I will definitely try and explore those functions in Sandbox.7/10"
,Recommended,290060,33119312,Posted: 2 July,all,[BMS] redmotion,This is great puzzle FPS combining exploration and puzzle-solving with programming. It's done very simply with nodes and it's really rewarding to play. Graphics are simple but there is a mysterious atmosphere and puzzles open out later so that you are free to explore your own solutions.Played less than an hour (story mode only) but feel I can recommend (if you like FPS games with an interesting mechanic).Recommended.
,Not Recommended,290060,33266882,Posted: 5 July,all,Princess Riikka,"I have to agree with the people calling this boring :-\Firstly, it's visually boring. It's just... blue. I couldn't keep myself going for very long as I suppose you can see but I never saw much of any interest. There were neat-looking background features but everything /in/ the game world to see was perhaps a little overly minimalistic. It's got a very ""functional"" aesthetic, I guess? This helped keep me from ever wanting to go anywhere or look at anything and despite the simplicity (interact with red things, block streamy things, walk to red things atop blue things...) it was pretty easy to get lost in the sea of blue and have issues figuring out where to go not because there's any puzzle involved but because it's just visually difficult to tell what's going on.As for puzzles, the ones I saw never had my interest. I still don't understand why exactly, only that I'm not in the least excited to stretch a block into a bridge. I guess those earlier levels could possibly be more interesting to someone who's never programmed anything ever but I'm really not sure about that. The last room I encountered seemed to just go full ""Here you go!"" in dumping a bunch of node types onto the player yet even then I felt like it was ""just another 'move the block, stand on the block, jump awkwardly onto another block...'"" kind of thing and quit.Speaking of awkward, the movement control felt weird to me. I think my main problem was the complete lack of inertia: your movement is /completely/ controlled by your inputs. If you're soaring through the air and let go of your movement keys then you just drop directly downward. This is disconcerting to me.As a kind of final comment and generalised thought on these sorts of game, I'd like to wonder aloud about making these games accessible and interesting both to beginners and to those who've already got programming experience. If programming is so much of the game that there's no game besides, maybe it would make sense to offer a bit of a skip past some of the earlier parts?"

The atmosphere kind of feels like those side levels in Assassin's Creed 2(I think), where you collect a certain amount of fragments, you go back to the isalnd, and you enter these portals that take you in a clean, crisp, and Sci-fy type of feel. Anyways, away from the atmosphere, the game is a first person puzzle game, and if you don't know how to code so well, then you may be stuck on some puzzles for awhile. The game gives you certain abilities for your, what the game calls a ""toolbox"", that you are going to unlock and use later down the line, ranging from timers to impact force. I'm not a paragraph man, I'm a bullet man, so let's get into listing some Pros and Cons, shall we?Pros:+ Has a very atmopsheric feel to it.+ If you don't know how to code, you can get a feel for it here, and if you do know how to code, this can help you, I guess.+ A very easy game to pick up and put down, there is no rush.+ Has some amazing music tracks and sound effects.+ Leaves you with a sense of mystery of what goal your working toward and why your doing it, which is the kind of stuff I like.+ Has very low graphic demands but still delivers what it needs to.+ Has a compass which tells you which direction your facing, which comes into play way more than I'd like to give it credit for figuring out which way I'm facing and how to code said block.+ Has a simple GUI for coding said blocks.Cons:- The atmosphere can easily be broken because some puzzle leave you with little to no information on what to do.- Later in the game, you get the ability to place down your own platforms, which means if you get stuck on a puzzle, you can place a platform down and cheap your way through some puzzles in the game, which I have had to do atleast 3 or 4 times out of the 40ish puzzles I've completed. This once again leaves you with a feeling of unfulfillment and/or an unfinished game, which disconnects you from the atmosphere.- The coding GUI has an annoying expansion system, you click on a box, a sub-unit of boxes expands around where you clicked said box, making it a bit annoying if your trying to speed through a puzzle.- For being on sale for $7 bucks when I got this, I'd honestly say that the game isn't worth the $13 or so bucks that it ask for normally. The game idea just isn't fleshed out enough or the game just doesn't expand on it's core features enough to be worth it.Overall, I'd personally say that the game is worth getting, but if your a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me, wait for it to be on sale."

It was a cool puzzle. Sadly that’s as interesting as it gets, and half of the puzzle was done already by the developer.A lot of the programming is already put on most platforms. I wish most of these were blanks and we had to build them instead of having them given to me. I went to sandbox after feeling the lackluster puzzle designs. It had so many options that I was bummed that no puzzles had this, just a few of them.The whole game felt like it was slowly building up to eventually having some challenge, then it ended with just jumping on premade platforms. Was thinking, now we got to work in the negative axis now!!! But nope just ended.This game’s respawn can get you stuck in a kill loop where you respawn and have to restart the level over. This is only a few minutes though, but this discourages experimentation as not going the only one solution could make you restart. (Seems a lot of complaints are this, but it’s really not that big an issue, it will at most waste a few minutes total overall)Overall as reviews at the time of buying were few, and not a lot of info, it was hard to find if this game was going to be challenging compared to other games with similar mechanics that I love. Sadly this was so basic, short and strict solutions means this game is a pass for anyone but those that have any notion of the most basic programming knowledge or curiosity as it will not satisfy that itch. I’m being harsh on not recommending this because if you’re looking for a game like this, I know it won’t satisfy you; instead get the games I recommend belowMy Score:DPaid: $3Main reason for dislike: Too basic of puzzles with most of the work done by the developers, leaving very little thinking of solutions on my partGames similar I recommend:AnyZachtronicsgame, seriously they are the creators of the programming genre, ranging from basically programming( TIS-100, SHENZHEN I/O)to assembly puzzles(Infinifactory)Human Resource Machine(easiest entry game with programming)Prelogate(hope this one doesn’t disappoint)Screeps(MMO programming game)"

I'm kinda torn but i'm gonna say err on the side of caution for now unless something changes.(Old review)Wonderfully innovative and fascinating game, great for anyone interested in coding or anyone who wants to understand it, really.Still needs some work, but it's going in a good direction.(Older review)This game is defnitely incomplete. I feel like a few more features are necessary before it's really something that would be worth buying. Not to say that I didn't enjoy playing it, but with how it is the amount of time I got out of it was less than an hour, probably 45 minutes at best (wasn't keeping track, so not sure). It is in early alpha, of course, so that's to be expected, but I reccommend just following the progress of development at least until a code-saving ability, functions feature, and additional levels are added. (When this happens, I'll make sure to update my review.)That said, I absoutely love the ideas, mechanics, and overall design of this game. The visual programming mechanic is great (although it could use some tweaks, mainly the addition of a function feature I mentioned a moment ago), and the puzzles you have so far are fantastic (although, again, more incompleteness; there could be some much more interesting challenges)The one big complaint I have that doesn't necessarily relate to its being in alpha is the coloring of the game. More specifically, the very bright grey color that the non-programmable objects are. It starts to hurt my eyes after a while, and in some cases it can be very difficult to see where I'm going (especially in small gaps between them; I often fall through because I don't notice the gaps are even there). I get that you're going for a minimalistic style, but I feel like some sort of texture needs to be applied to it so I can SEE them."

Also there are some bugs that are pretty enoying. E.g. you have to use the incoming force to catapult you to some platform. But when you jump on the programmed platform, nothing happens. Suddenly with no programming changed on the fifth try it worked.It has some nice aspects and may be interesting if you are new to programming."
