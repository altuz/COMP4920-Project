,Recommended,290260,11352348,"Posted: 21 July, 2014",all,Spirit,"""Sokobond"" is the best kind of game - one that is fun and educational... FUNDUCATONAL, if you will. This elegant little puzzler is a lot like that science teacher you had in middle school (hi Mr. Hellmund! Why yes I've applied myself - I review video games in my free time!) who's enthusiasm for the scientific method is only eclipsed by his increasingly colorful ties. This is pretty, this is challenging, and you'll learn a thing or two. And don't be too intimidated; this game doesn't require you to know a lick of chemistry. If you're a fan of puzzlers and like factoids, check it out. I think it's a refreshing change of pace. It isn't BREAKING the mold, not really. This has been done many times before, but that isn't really all that BAD either."

The core component of Sokobond is to combine elements together to create molecules. Sounds simple, right? As with any other puzzle game, the puzzles in Sokobond can become deceptively hard. Whilst the design is simple, it doesn't distract from the core gameplay.After you get to grips with the understanding of the molecule fusion, the game will throw a few curveballs at you, allowing you to split bonds or create double bonds, for example, furthering the possibilites of creation and puzzle solving. A small neat touch is that after you beat a level, you're given a fact about the molecule you just created. You really can learn while you play!Overall, for it's price and enjoyability, Sokobond gets 8.5/10."

It will take hours upon hours until you can completely finish it.  That's great when looking for price value in a game.Difficult Level.  They aren't simple click and you're done puzzles.

It reminded me of Chip's Challenge without the fun skates.  The only reason I continued on and finished it was my own need to finish all my puzzle games to completion.I got it in a bundle and I loved most of the other games so I wasn't about to return it.

It's a fairly simple puzzle that tends to have overwhelmingly convoluted solutions. You control a person in a warehouse, and your job is to put all the boxes away into designated places. They are heavy, so you can only move them by pushing them around. You can't move through boxes, and you can't push a box if there's a wall or another box behind it. Simple rules, incredibly complex solutions.Sokobond takes this premise and adds chemistry to the mix. You control an atom, and your goal is to get all the valence electrons in all the atoms to bond. For example, you might control a Hydrogen, and another Hydrogen and an Oxygen are somewhere. Your goal would therefore be to bond both Hydrogens to the Oxygen to make water. Or mayble you'll control a carbon amidst another carbon and six hydrogens to make ethane.Just like Sokoban, in Sokobond, you have a maximum of four options available to you at any time: move up, move down, move left, or move right. Just like Sokoban, if you try to move into an atom, you'll push it. Unlike Sokoban, if two atoms with free valence electrons become adjacent, they will bond, and bonded atoms will move as a group.Later, you'll be introduced to three more puzzle elements: debonders which remove a bond you made, rebonders which add another bond to a pair of atoms (allowing for molecules like ethene or acetic acid), and rotators, which let you rotate bonds.Just like Sokoban, Sokobond has a simple premise, but loads of depth, and all those extra-convoluted solutions."

You don't need to know anything special about chemistry, it's just the framework for a set of devious puzzles. The core of the game is pushing around blocks, sokoban style, except they form bonds, linking to each other. As you progress some puzzles feature multiple bonds, splitting and reconnecting atoms, and rotating molocules till you have just the right shape to reach that one last atom you need. Every level ends with a bit of chemistry trivia about the molocule you just created.Most puzzles aren't trial and error or brute force, but tempt you into making assumptions that keep you from spotting an elegant solution, which makes solving them very very satisfying.As you can see from the screenshots, graphics are purely functional, but in a puzzle game that's not a bad thing."
