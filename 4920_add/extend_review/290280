76561198013754609,Recommended,290280,10797460,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,Animosh,"I usually don't write reviews in English, but I feel like it could be useful to some, so here we go.Unlike the other reviewers (judging by the hours they've put into it), I've actually beaten the game. So you can believe me when I tell you it's tough. Really tough. The difficulty is fairly reasonable in the first zone, but from the second zone onwards, your patience is going to be tested a lot. So if you're easily frustrated, skip the rest of this review and go find another game, because you're going to pull your hair out until you're hairless in every zone of your body. Hell, you might pull someone else's hair out too.But anyway, first things first: the gameplay. The main concept of Volt is fairly simple: you're a battery, and your goal is to escape from a factory, so you can live in freedom rather than being destroyed. This is easier said than done, however, because you can't walk. All you can do is swing (using a limited supply of electricity beams) and jump (using a very limited supply of energy). Some variations and complications are introduced in the game, but most of the time, you're going to be swinging through a level and solving platforming puzzles. And I must say it mostly works quite well. The swinging and puzzle-solving is entertaining, it is implemented in a variety of ways to avoid being repetitive (across different levels at least), and it has some nice highlights in it. The boss fights, for example, are well done and pretty memorable.But the gameplay isn't Volt's only strong point. In fact, if you ask me, it is not even its strongest point: that prize goes to its atmosphere. It probably doesn't suit everyone's taste, but I really like the minimalistic, high-contrast industrial environments, and I really like the music as well. It varies between ambient and minimalistic techno or trance (whatever you wish to call it), which fits the visual design of the levels really well and sets the right tone for the game. I personally preferred the more energetic music from zone 3 onwards (as it makes for a more uplifting atmosphere), but the ambient was pretty great as well.Unfortunately, however, even though Volt is, in my view, a good game, it is far from perfect. Most crucially, it can become very frustrating at times. The levels have no checkpoints, and they are pretty long (in comparison to Super Meat Boy, say), so there are plenty of levels you're going to have to spend a long time in before finally beating them (over half an hour). Add to that imprecise controls (as is to be expected given the physics-based gameplay, but better design might have alleviated the frustrations a bit) and some questionable level design (a puzzle on the end of a difficult long level, where you will inevitably die a couple of times), and the result is that unless you're some kind of Buddha, you're going to cry in agony multiple times.All in all, I do recommend Volt to some gamers, but I certainly don't recommend it to everyone. If the main concept appeals to you, if the atmosphere suits your sentiments and if you like a challenge, you could do worse than buying Volt. It's very cheap, after all, and it offers about 15 hours of gameplay (although it must be noted that you're going to be stuck in the same levels a lot of the time, making the game pretty repetitive at times). If you're easily frustrated, however, you should avoid this game at all costs. 7/10"
,Recommended,290280,9818039,"Posted: 14 April, 2014",all,Chad Thundercock,"Volt is a pretty good game, in my opinion.  It's definitely not the best game i've played this year, or even this month for that matter, but for the price of six dollars (or your regional equivalent), I think it's a wonderful deal.  While the story isn't really important to a game like this, the gameplay is, and in my opinion the gameplay is very good in Volt.  The game works in a physics based way.  You move by attaching beams of electricity to your surroundings, and letting gravity do the rest.  I personally do not typically like it when games do this, but I feel like Volt did it very well.  The difficulty is also right.  At the time of writing this review, I am on the 16th stage of level 1, and the difficulty is already starting to become noticable.  It will probably take someone quite a few attempts on each level to be able to beat the game.  Also, the puzzles are not really explained to you.  This may deter some people, but I think that it allows players to figure out many different ways to solve puzzles.  The music is pretty good. It seems to fit the gameplay very well, but it doesn't really add a whole lot to the package.  The art, however, is very good.  The colors that were used really manage to pull off the industrial theme, and they add emphasis to important things by making those things stick out with brighter colors.  The controls are not as good as I would like them to be though.  The game works completely with the mouse.  To break the beams, you hold the lmb and drag it.  This seems kind of finicky to me, because sometimes it seems to cut the wrong beam, or both beams.  The rest of the controls seem to work just fine.  Overall, I would say that Volt is a very good game, that is worth the price that they are asking for it."
,Recommended,290280,21359010,"Posted: 21 February, 2016",all,Whiteswart,"Usually I call games like this ""short casual stuff fitting for a short-brake"". Well, in that, Volt is neither short nor quite fit for naming it ""casual"". And I'd better read some books in my short-break, than enraging myself with another try to beat a level there.Volt is getting ""mixed"" ratings - on Steam and everywhere else. There are many negative reviews on this fine concept, and, alas, those negative reviews have solid ground for ""not recommending"" Volt to normal players. Sadly, but, with all obvious advantages Volt have, it is not quite rewarding game, unless you're a very hard-headed fan of over-the-head-difficult-puzzles, seeing the ultimate reward in solving yet-another-riddle.Volt starts very intriguing, presenting quite nonstandard hero - a battery in some technical mazes, which can move itself only by two beams, which works like net of Spiderman. You catch a moment, shoot or release a beam, taking acceleration of this shift to push yourself forward, to the ""exit"" door. And that goes on and on, the levels quickly getting more and more complex, you have limited amount of beams to make your way through, and you gotta be careful too, for there are very treacherous grounds everywhere... And further you go, the more obstacles you'll meet.And after some time you'll meet your top. The level which you can't beat even in hundred approaches. And there you're asking yourself - what am I doing here? What's the purpose of this lifeform to exist on Earth? And so on.And you don't find answers.To summarize that topic, Volt - is a puzzle game using some basic laws of mechanics, with very decent layout and very sophisticated levels. But it does not have a fleur of great games like World of Goo or Limbo, it is much more tough than Cut-the-Rope and similar projects... It is pointlessly cryptic and hard for the majority of players.With all that, it is adequately priced, so I set thumbs up button. If you catch it on some sale or in a bundle, do not hesitate to give it a shot. Maybe it was made right for you.Mark 6.7/10. Interesting approach in puzzle games, with only one real downside - it is punishing much more than rewarding. Other than that, it is fine."

Basically, it's fancy Cut the Rope. You extend lazor grapple beams, and cut them by dragging scross the beams. Additionally, you can bounce off the group, which leads to some pretty fun fall-jump-swing-cut-swing portions.The only thing that's really frustrated me so far is no explaination of new elements. There's a -short- tutorial explaining the basic rope mechanics and then nothing so even if you're doing well you'll run into something new you don't know how to work with, and usually you have to experiement a few times before figuring out how to deal with it."

76561197983662248,Not Recommended,290280,10837425,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Gameplay: Volt is one of those games that I was tentative on picking up when it came out, as it seemed kinda like another one of those ""HAY GUIZ WERE HARD GEAM PLAE US"" kinds of games (like Cloudberry Kingdom and Eryi's Action). Fortunately, the level design in this game is better than those games, although I sometimes found myself thinking I might actually have more fun with those two aforementioned games (I'll talk about this later in the review). The game bills itself as a puzzle-platformer, although it is more apt to say it's more of a ""you got puzzle in my platformer!"" as opposed to ""you got platformer in my puzzle!"" That's not to say that the game is completely devoid of puzzles; there are a fair few levels in the game that do require actual thought. One feature I would've liked to have seen would be to look the level over beforehand so that you would have no surprises going through the level, or in the case of a puzzle at the end of the level, you would have ample time to figure it out.The controls are fairly simplistic; the mouse does everything. Left mouse button shoots your tether (you can shoot two) and right mouse button allows you to jump. Jumping takes a bar of health, of which you have four. To sever a tether, you click and drag a line over said tether; ""much like one would in a tablet game,"" I had thought. It turns out that I was right; this game is a ported tablet/phone game. One thing I wish the game would have done on the control scheme would have implemented is a Portal-esque control scheme where LMB would fire/retract the left tether (you could even color-code it like Portal) and RMB would fire/retract the right tether. Also, jumping would quite naturally be space.So, you may be asking: this sounds quite alright for a game. Why the thumbs down? I've gotta be honest; I just don't find the game fun. Yeah, it's hard and I do enjoy challenging games, but this game more often than not felt hard because of the control scheme. Even after five hours, the control scheme felt clunky and sometimes downright unresponsive. Perhaps it was just me being bad, but there were quite a few instances where it felt like the game just dropped my inputs. Also, severing the tethers with a line is inherently imprecise and quite often killed be because either the camera moved the line around or I cut a tether I didn't even mean to.A question a game designer friend asked me one time when I was talking about a game was along the lines of ""are you playing a game to beat it or are you playing a game because you want to and are having fun?"" For pretty much the entire game, my answer to that was the former, up until 2-18 where I instead opted to answer, ""I'm not playing the game anymore."" That was the stage that made me stop and realize how little fun I was actually having. Also, that's why I said I may have actually had more fun playing Cloudberry or Eryi's Action earlier; while those games are unfair by design, at least I'd be excited and having fun, however masochistic of fun it may be. I just stopped caring after a while with this game.That's the tragic bit about this game, though: I liked the concept. I liked the idea, but the execution of said idea just wasn't any fun to me. You may feel different, and that's okay; I've never had the most popular of opinions.  However, I can't personally recommend this game on the gameplay alone. 4/10.Story: You are battery. Escape the plant. Yeah, not really worth talking about or even rating.Graphics: When you start the game, you are greeted with everybody's favorite Unity launcher, which gives you the option of changing resolutions and graphical fidelities from three presets. There really isn't any need for super precise control of graphical fidelity, since this game opts for more of a stylistic presentation as opposed to a technical presentation. The art style in this game is... alright, I guess? It's rather Puddle-esque, although Puddle had some thematic variation. Unfortunately, some portions of the foreground do get in the way of some levels. It never created that much of an issue for gameplay, but it's still annoying when you're hidden behind a foreground pipe. The graphics style never did much for me, but at least it's functional. 2/5.Sound: Holy butts the music in this game is boring. It's some of the most uninspired techno I've heard in a while. Like seriously, the music in this game is not good at all. I ended up turning it off after a while, instead opting for other OSTs like Unreal Tournament's and Digital Devil Saga's. I had a better time after doing that. Because I ended up deciding that the music was so uninteresting that I had to turn it off, I'll give it a 1/5 for the sound portion.Overall scores are: 4/0/2/1; cumulative score of 3.5/10. I picked it up while it was on sale, so I don't feel like I've been ripped off or anything, but I do feel like I kinda wasted my time with this game. You may end up liking it, but I just can't personally recommend it."

Sometimes It'll shoot two of the electrical-voltage-line things instead of one, and quite often doesn't know whether you want to shoot or cut the voltage line. Sometimes them errors can help make the goal more difficult to reach, but other times it just gets annoying.Overall, It's a great game and I would recommend it, but I think the controls need to be fixed for it to be more fun or less frustrating."

The problem was very soon detected: level design. The mechanics could be used to create interesting puzzles, but the result is much more inclined towards precision platforming instead. It's interesting how many potentially good games I've played that can be described similarly. Designing puzzles is definitely harder so it's tempting to make action games. But making action games is deceptively hard (as opposed to visibly hard, in the case of puzzles). So what happens is the player is there, hypnotized by some new mechanic, a contraption, an interesting set of rules, whatever, and he wants to explore it, to see what he can do with it. Instead what he gets is a series of tunnels filled with deadly traps that send you back to the beginning at every misstep, forcing him to just repeat the same movements that worked so far. Imagine the developer of Portal decides that every level will be filled with turrets and deadly pits, with the occasional use of portals to take down a turret.Of course, I'm dumbing everything down to puzzle X action for argument purposes. My point is that finding the best way to design levels for a novel mechanic is just that extra challenge people innovating did not need but totally do have.I hate writing these reviews. I realize how harsh I am as a critic. The thing is, I see a lot of potential, I love new things, and I really want these developers to succeed! not discourage them with harsh criticism. So I'm off to buy Hot Guns now. Looks like a cool game. Hopefully I'll recommend it :D"

Volt is a game that starts out simply enough, but as soon as you have the hang of the controls, it throws all kinds of new challenges your way and really makes you think about how to beat them. With a solid physics engine, a variety of obstacles, and just clever level design, Volt is a game that makes you feel like a genius when you finally crack that irritating level you've been stuck on for half an hour.8/10."

With the current gameplay and controls I could see this possibly working better with a touch screen monitor as it feels like this game was ported straight from the Google or Apple marketplace, and the teadium of using a mouse makes this more of a chore and less enjoyable. Overall the game has potential but the devs missed the mark on the action tag. What makes this game even more difficult is trying to utilize any quick reactions that are needed on occation, as the overall slow pace of the game and the drone music is putting me to sleep.The ideas are good but not excuted correctly. I did also like the retro contemporary graphic design, though they do look like they were done by Puppy Games dev's. If are looking for 'action' I would highly recommend against this title. If you are looking for something similar, try a Drink Box Studio title or Puppy Games title that is 'action'.

Equipped with a limited number of electric beams, you can connect to walls, move or destroy objects, turn switches, and charge generators.You also have the ability to jump or push off the walls - the rest is up to physics and gravity.  sounds like a fun challenge, but what makes the game super repetitive is the limited amount to beams to use to get around and to interact with the extra obsticals within the level.  The only thing I can say is a 5/5 star in this game is the music that plays in the levels that keept me tuned in the game for a little longer.

This game is so frustrating.I really want to like this game but it's so frustrating trying to get hold of something with your beam and even though it's at a reachable distance the beam just doesn't stick. You try again and again, clicking again and again but it only works sometimes and you just don't understand why it didn't work before. I just got fed up of trying.I just hope the developers fix this issue. If I click on a surface in mid air that is inside the area of reach, it should always work.Essentially you are a battery that can jump upwards and can also send a limited amount of beams to grab on to walls and objects. And you have to get from point A to point B while avoiding dangerous obstacles and picking up items (for bonus points, I think) on the way.I like the game and the atmosphere but the music can be somewhat annoying. Especially if you add the frustration mentioned above.I guess I'll come back to this game to try to complete the level where I got stuck but if the developers don't work on these issues I don't think I'll want to play much more.For now, I can't recommend Volt. Unfortunately."

I like difficult games when the mechanics are fair.Volt isn't such a game. The mechanics are horrible. Your main character will sometimes not attach to platforms even if they are well in range, making you lose instantly. The issue, I think, is that if you move your mouse EVEN ONE PIXEL while clicking, the game will register this as a swipe (to cut a link), instead of a click. Unfortunately this makes the game quite unplayable on PCs.But hey, I paid less than a dollar for it so you don't have to."

76561197991465987,Recommended,290280,19412564,"Posted: 1 December, 2015",all,gbors,"Volt is one of the most ambivalent games I've ever played. The basic concept is perfect for a hardcore platformer - you need to guide your battery through a maze of a facility, and you can't move your character directly - you can use a beam (a kind of electric grappling hook) and let gravity (or moving objects) move you, or you can launch yourself outward from the platform you're sitting on (or hanging next to). Add in the atmospheric visuals and sounds, try to forgive the horrible music, and then you only need two more components for a perfect experience.Number one is the level design. I have to say it's surprisingly good - most levels challenge both your problem solving skills and your dexterity. My only gripe is some of the levels are too hard - with several opportunities to die easily, limited energy and limited beams, some simply take too many tries to get right. Otherwise, it's very good.Number two is, as with any hardcore platformer, the controls. Control design is actually pretty good, and the patches brought a few welcome tweaks. It's all the more surprising to realise during the game that the controls are hideously non-responsive. When you're moving, there's a 20-30% (!!) chance that you fire a beam and nothing happens. Also when you jump, the actual direction of the jump often comes as a surprise. Now add that on top of the near-sadistic level design, and what do you get? Rage quits, mostly.I was thinking a lot whether to recommend this game. I'm a great fan of games like Eron, and Volt has the potential to be similarly spectacular. In the end, it gets a thumbs up because what's broken can be fixed. Dear devs, if you happen to read this, please take a few hours and find out why those fickle beams behave the way they do..."
