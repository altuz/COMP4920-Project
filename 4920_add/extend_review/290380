76561198091838988,Recommended,290380,13987806,"Posted: 14 January, 2015",all,Amirani  Unbound,Excercise your critical thinking skills in this fun puzzle game.   With its simplistic design and musical sound effects I found it quite enjoyable and would highly recommend it.  The concept is simple.  Balls are shot from an opening and you must place angles and or portals to get it to open doors and get them to the end.  The difficulty is you must put them in the proper spot at the proper time to achieve your goal.It is a great game for all ages however those under ten may need help to finish it unless they are unusually patient.  A great game to play with your children though.  Get their little problem solving wheels turning!  The game has some difficult levels but not overly so in my opinion.  I did however cheat on one of the bonus levels and look for the answer elsewhere.There are a number of free levels for download in the steam workshop as well.  Just subscribe to them and they will be downloaded the next time you start the game.I did not find any bugs and was not able to complete any level using less than the full complement of pieces provided.   Note: This is edited because I could not find the level editor. I did find the level editor it is in your steam files.In my opinon it would be worth the full price of $4.99 or even better to purchase it on sale!  However I prefer to let the gamer decide how much a game is worth as it is a subjective matter.  Hope this review helped.Enjoy your Gaming!

,Recommended,290380,14093265,"Posted: 20 January, 2015",all,LeonRes,"June 4, 2015Micron is a decent game, short and reasonable. I would consider it purely average, providing good gameplay with fair polish, but treading familiar ground.I was expecting some rhythm elements, but they really don't exist. Each level has sounds associated with bullet reflections, which helps to generate the music. Nothing is really based on moving to the beat, and some puzzles require actions between the beats. Most levels don't require speed, but a few require timed actions to catch bullets at the right time. The difficulty curve varied widely due to these timing-based levels, forcing several restarts to complete. Still, the game is quite easy.The music is fair, but is not a real gameplay element. Most levels are short and can only be solved in a certain way, so replayability only comes from Workshop levels. Puzzles were interesting but not hugely satisfying. Later levels became more frustrating, as one mistake meant a full restart. Once levels feature over 10 objects, I was wanting an Undo button instead of a full restart. Granted, it didn't take long, but the short game length could mean that 20% of your time is spent restarting and rebuilding levels.Micron didn't do anything bad, but didn't inspire me much. It's a decent game at a fair price, a nice way to spend a few hours but not really compelling you to challenge your mind. I would recommend a sale above 50%, below $2.50 USD is a good time-value. If you are looking for rhythm gameplay, keep looking. But puzzle fans should find some entertainment here for a couple hours."

It's a decently difficult puzzler with nice music and sound effects for the different things that the balls do. It's pretty short, though, and, just like most other puzzle games, once you beat it, it has essentially no replay value. There are some bonus levels that get unlocked once it's beaten, though, and with the Steam Community adding puzzles to it, this game's only shortfall is mostly neutralized. And for the price, should for whatever reason you not like it, there's really no loss."
,Recommended,290380,11398430,"Posted: 24 July, 2014",all,Peekabluu,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect with this game. The preview seemed minimalistic in art design and pretty simple for gameplay as well. As it turns out, simplicity is what you get, and that is not a bad thing.There are very few mechanics in this game. You have some slanted walls and eventually you can get a straight reflective wall and portals. For a game with only 4 placeable objects it is incredibly interesting. Each puzzle has a different goal-- A method of discovering a new way of thinking through a puzzle, and while the game is fairly short (I finished all of the achievements in 2 hours) it was definately worth my time. Additionally, the music for the game changes based on your actions which left me absolutely giddy for the first few stages.If you enjoy a solid puzzle game and a conceptually magical soundtrack I would definately get this game."

Micron is advertised as a ""fusion of puzzle and rhythm gameplay"", but the rhythm portion of the claim doesn't really hold water. At no point does the player have to keep up to any kind of a rhythm to solve any of the puzzles - While a couple of levels do require reasonably nimble fingers, the ""rhythm"" is just incidental music created by the sounds of the projectiles hitting various targets.The game has a nice, laidback feel and very clear, simple graphics. The 60-ish levels don't really ever become frustrating, and can all be solved in a reasonable amount of time. In fact, clearing the game 100% only took me a couple of hours. If you're looking for a mellow diversion for a few hours, this might fit the bill. Micron didn't really impress me in any singular aspect, but sometimes just a solid execution can be enough."

,Recommended,290380,20632751,"Posted: 19 January, 2016",all,Dark Blue Monkey,"What a pleasant little distraction for the last couple of days.To look at it from the outside, it's a faily standard switch-pressing puzzler of which there have been quite a few.  However, Micron stands apart in a couple of ways:1. It doesn't get stupidly hard (see caveat below)2. It doesn't go on longer than it should3. Each level doesn't take too long to completeMost games of this time get to a point, and it's clear the developer's been holding back some painfully hard levels, and has run out of 'ramp up' levels, and all of a sudden drops you off a cliff.  You're sitting there looking a level thinking ""The last level took me 2 minutes, and I've been staring at this for more than 20. What happened?"" (I'm looking at you P.B. Winterbottom amongst others). This doesn't happen in Micron... The levels are iteratively harder, and many of the 'nice interlude' levels (as I think of them) give you a strong hint as to what the twist in the upcoming level is going to be, while being pretty easy in themselves.There are some strategies you learn, and sometimes you just look at a level, the selection of pieces and it all just clicks.Okay, here comes the caveat. There are a couple of levels which require you to do something a tad differently to the levels around them: Bonus 9 comes to mind.   For those, there was no choice but to go have a look at a hint.  Every permutation I tried just wouldn't work.  In those cases, it's usually because you need to do something with precision timing, and Ijust hadn't experimented enough.I like the little tricks it plays with your assumptions on colours, and the ways it makes you think about stretching 'flight time' to synchronise events.The game would have only taken me one evening to finish, if I'd played it in one sitting.  All in all, I think about 3 hours of playtime, which was perfect.For a quid or two, a nice little puzzler, perfect for a plane flight, train ride, or just whiling away a little time with a cup of tea."

The minimalistic music works well and helps to absorb you into the game. The main game is a bit short, but the steam workshop allows you to play user created levels, or create your own.Some of the later levels are quite difficult if you don't examine the puzzle close enough. Stop and think. Backwards deduction helps. Even then you will miss things and may get stuck. If you want a real challenge try the player created content, some of it is insane!Thumbs up.

Very simple mechanics indeed, but the levels are all incredibly easy offering no real challenge, aside from a small handful (let's say 10). I managed to complete all the stock levels (including the 12 bonus missions) in less than two hours.Micronis a decent game, but has very little to offer for it's price tag.

It will make your brain work!- The sounds are goods. It even somewhat take you to the idea of how the puzzle works. (colors too...)- Level editor... :^)Cons:- Controller support isn't a good idea... the worst way to play it. I've done it with my mouse only, and won't even think about playing it with a controller. Touchscreen should certainly be the best.- So much for the rythms... even with good sounds, it doesn't give much.- Simple mechanics can't leads to many possible user created levels good enough...

,Recommended,290380,31670783,Posted: 10 May,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Casual - Music & RhythmAdditional Tags: Casual - Flinger & Object RouteTLDR: This is an object routing game - using a hex grid - in which you deviate the movement of a ball to have it reach an exit point. The options menu is very limited. Game fullscreens correctly. Xbox 360 pad detected correctly. If this was mobile its ported mostly competently. Aesthetics are simple but clean and effective. Sound design is surprisingly good despite its simplicity.This is not a music game or a rhythm game. But what sets it apart as a puzzle game is how the sound effects for the ball and the routing tiles end up making a sort of a song sometimes, and are mostly pleasing to the ear even when they do not. Which is why I have decided to put it in the Casual - Music category rather than the Casual - Object Routing one.I only played the initial few levels to assess the worth of the title so I cannot comment on the complexity of the puzzles. The initial ones were fairly simple.Conclusion : Between the Xbox pad support, the vibration of the pad in synch with the sound effects, and the overall feeling of rhythm that the game uses to stay dynamic and interesting I would say this is one of the few puzzle games that I can instinctively tell right away is deserving of being a form of videogame entertainment. So for that it earns my recommendation."

Took me 1hr 28mins to complete it which isn't a lot of playing time even at the reduced price of £3.59.In the blurb it says your solutions create the music... in reality there's not a lot of music to shout about in this. I could have done better with Garageband in 5 mins. This certainly isn't Circuits (music is the game) or Electronic Super Joy (great soundtrack). On the 1/4 of puzzles that took a bit of figuring out I mostly found the music distracting and muted my sound until i'd solved it. There's also no rhythm component to the gameplay at all which makes the description ""unique fusion of puzzle and rhythm gameplay"" just blatantly untrue.If you have plenty of money buy it and enjoy your 1.5hrs. If you're looking for value in your games I wouldn't bother."

I consider roughly waking my partner to show her how clever I am but remember that she is a pregnant insomniac and this may not go down well.Micron turns out to be quite a lovely little puzzle game. It features a clean minimalist art style, clever and challenging level design and, best of all, a beautifully implemented audio system which syncs the impact of every pellet with a different sound depending on the surface it hits. At its best, this system provided some gorgeously atmospheric soundscapes with sweetly tinging xylophones and triangles mixing with bass and drums or sometimes, just the gentle sound of rain.It will take fourteen years for me to finish."
