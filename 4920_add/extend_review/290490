,Not Recommended,290490,17647348,"Posted: 21 August, 2015",all,Spirit,"Meet the Flockers!Great name, an excellent name for a horror game! It's evocative, right? Birds are weird – carry diseases, vomit all over their babies, have cloacas, flock, etc. Oh, and religious heads often refer to their congregations as their “flock,” which is kind of creepy, cultish when you think about it. So the name works fabulously, we've established that.Concept is pretty cool too: twisted humanoids hunting one another, fighting one another with light in a twisted game of Red Light Green Light with a finite number of lives. Very novel!And the concept artwork? Beautiful, freaky, brilliant. Absolutely!“So why is The Flock a steaming pile of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥” A hypothetical person might ask.Fortunately for you I spent $17 USD so I can find out and you don't have to!First off, it looks the part of steaming dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now that's a bit harsh of me; it doesn't look BAD, but it certainly won't be winning any monster beauty pageants. The models look goofy whether they're standing still or in motion. They just look silly; like decayed, neutered necromorphs with a slapdash texture job. The three maps currently available all sort of look the same – you've seen one gray, blocky, near linear map, you've seen them all.Secondly, it isn't scary. Now if that isn't the kiss of death for an asymmetrical horror multiplayer game I don't know what is. I mentioned in the paragraph previously that the models all look goofy, but on top of that there appear to be no death animations for carrier and flockers alike. You'll just be minding your own business or stalking some carrier and suddenly poof, the screen goes white and you're either dead or a carrier.Well that's no good – smacks of rushed laziness.Thirdly, the titular flock appears to have flown the coop. No one is playing. Now to be fair this could change. In a few hours the word might get out and The Flock's population will explode!But we don't live in Pretend Land, no. We live in cold, hard Realityville where the meals are infrequent and the winters are harsh.Fourthly, it isn't fun! It just isn't fun to sprint around the aforementioned gray maps, attacking gray beings with no death animations, to grab a Portal light gun to point at doors and gates.You know what I think? I think The Flock is one precarious step above being a scam. “Buy this game with a trivial finite lives system! If you don't it will be gone forever!”Because the developers think you're all a bunch of hoarding, hyperconsuming man-babies that will grab a questionable product because one day it might be gone.I promise you, PROMISE YOU, that The Flock's population will never hit zero.Because ♥♥♥♥-all people will play this ugly, rushed drek."

Coding isn't even completed in certain parts.  But don't let this deter you, however! I look at it as an Easter egg: which string of code won't be found in this part of the game? Also, the ""Population"" aspect of this game is ridiculous.  The limit will never hit 0, same as how updates will likely never occur.  This game is horrendously overpriced for the current stage it's in.Edit: I have returned! For 20 minutes I sat in a queue, waiting to play. This game has died.

Game uninstalled.**Original Review**The basic concept of this game is outstanding. Taking permadeath to a new level. Would I recommend this game? Unfortunately no.I've only played for a short while and I'll update this as I play more but as it stands there are only 3 levels and the gameplay is extremely repetitive. If this game had been under $10 I would whole heartedly recommend it.  Having a buddy chip in half then giving them the extra game makes the sting more beareable. I just can't see putting this into my normal game rotation as it stands.The ""Ending"" is the only reason I'll continue to play this game unless the developer adds some diversity to the gameplay"

No death animation. Just a screen flash. It's so damn repetitive and boring!It's so annoying that the game was hyped quite a fair bit and was such a let down. To be completely honest, i dont think the death count will ever reach 0. why? It's such a boring game, not enough people will give a damn to play it enough."

I have to lead with this statement because I cannot make that clear enough. At first, I absolutely loved the game, because the idea alone is fantastic! A game that has limited copies based on in game deaths? That's fantastic! So I rushed to buy it...but then I played it. The controls are bland, and in fact, there are things you can't even do with a keyboard that can only be done with your controler, if you have one hooked up. There are spots in the game where bright white flashes of light happen if you look at a corner, and these flashes are squares that sometimes turn green. A glitch, that's fine, right? Well that's not it. You're playing the creatures most of the time, but you can only jump, sprint, and use decoys. With there being only 3 maps, most of which need you to be up high to ""get the drop"" on your target, you can't readily jump up to the tops, you have to take a round about way up, which would be fine if the game wasn't painfully short. My first 3 games didn't even total up to 10 minutes of gameplay because the light carrier just learned how to camp, and when I learned how, I couldn't be killed...until glitches were exposed. If the enemy stops close enough to you, they can freeze, turn to stone, and then lunge and kill you, even though the light is right on them. This game is unbalanced because it's not even finished. The controls for all TWO classes are bland as all hell, and you can barely have map mobility as the monsters. This game is just a let down, and the fact that it's not even enjoyable while you CAN play it is even worse, because according to the description, after the ""climax"", you can NEVER play the game again. Don't waste your money on this game, just wait for Youtube videos, because this game is a waste of money and time. It should only be 5 dollars, even including the free game. This is just trash."

Besides, the simplistic gameplay will get stale withing 4-5 rounds of playing it. This is yet another game that should have been a Garry's Mod module."

,Not Recommended,290490,17665051,"Posted: 22 August, 2015",all,GretSeat,"""I wanted to like this game, I really did. But it's just not possible...""I'm pretty sure that's everyone's mindset right now.Sure, I only played the game for half an hour, but that's really all there is in this game to decide... 30 minutes.Concept: The concept for this game is incredible, it really is. You have a game where the developers look at the statistics and realize games only have an ""active life"" of a few months. So the developers made a game where as you ""Die"" you actually affect the population of the game. The game's devs gave the game over 215million lives, thinking the game will go for a few months, and then after the population drops the game can NO LONGER be bought on Steam. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's an amazing idea! Now you bring people in because it's basically a limited time only game. Then they have ""Phase 2"" which after the population hits 0, no one can buy the game and only the people who HAVE the game can play it. They add in a ""Finale"" (Which hasn't really been discussed) but it means the games goes into ""endgame"" mode where in a few weeks(?) the game will finally end with the race of creatures you're playing as becoming extinct. It's a GREAT concept. I was sold, I really was. I wanted to be part of that finale! I wanted to stream it and say ""I was there when the Flock ended!"" Sadly, I don't even think this game will drop it's population below 214mil because it's... just not a good game.Visuals:The game's environment is meant to creep you out. 3 maps that are similar but kind of different. It really send chills down my spine when you're walking past all these statues of the Flock and thinking ""Which one is a real person, and which isn't??"" Yeah, I couldn't help but be incredibly creeped out by the environment. The character models though aren't good. The models are creepy when standing in ""Statue"" mode, but that's about it. When they are moving they look kind of... ""Derpy"" and I mean they have their claws up and it makes them look... not scary. Especially when you see them in the distance, they are just like 'Oh hi, I see you, you're not scary"" But the lighting is pretty awesome. The flashlight you hold really does it's job at being a huge flashlight, lighting up areas, and when turning it off it's dark.Gameplay:This is where the game falls short... incredibly short. It feels like the devs just didn't try. You have this game where it could easily be incredible, but instead lacks a lot. Let me explain: We have scary creatures fighting over this ""Light"", which is awesome. You get the light, you become a 'humanoid"" and then walk slower, but have a light to defend yourself, you keep the light... you gain points, simple enough. It's creepy for the first ten minutes because you have people following you all the time. They want to kill you and take the light. But you don't know WHEN you die, or how. They have so much emphasis on the population dropping that they didn't add in death animations. When you do get attacked your screen almost immediately goes to the ""Population drop"" screen. Sometimes you say ""Wait what? How did I die?"" It's also infuriating when you're shiny your light on someone, and it DOESN'T kill them. Makes no sense.The gameplay gets stale quickly, doing the same thing over and over.I honestly don't even feel like adding anymore to this review, because it's kind of all I can really say. I'm really disappointed, I am.I asked for a refund, and hope to get it, because I just don't want to play this anymore.I'm also very sad for the developers, because they put such a BIG number as their population. Over 215,342,530... The sad part is I HIGHLY doubt the population will drop to 0. I really do. Now that I've played the game I know for a fact that the population won't even drop past 215mil because people just won't play this game in a week.Sure you might have a few boys who will think the game is great, but in all seriousness, it's awful and it probably won't be played by next week, I'm calling it.Don't buy this game. And if you did... get a refund before you hit 2 hours.Sorry devs, great concept, poor execution..."

Considering Steam are still charging real money for a game that no longer can be played.The concept was there were a finite amount of the creatures (The flock) in which players could play as. There were only ever a few hundred million from memory. In game there was a flock counter, every time a creature was killed the counter went down.Up until late the game was completely playable but now there are no creatures for the game to populate the game with so it is completely unplayable except if you wanted to just roam around and explore the world in which you played which is pretty cool but none the less completely useless as a game.You are in fact buying a game that CAN NOT be played anymore."

First off I like the idea of the game and the game itself is fun. There are only 3 maps and only 2 of them are good. Some graphics options cannot be turned on such as fullscreen and antialiasing, whenever I click apply they reset. The light system is broken af. Flock can move through the light even when it is shined at them. I thought this game was good but I will give it a negative review until the game becomes less flawed.Edit: The games first update fixes some problems such as the string not found error, increased the score to a 120 from 100 and decreased points gained from the light carrier from 40 to 30. The game is a litle bit more balanced now."

Followed by notifications and on-screen prompts for a joypad (specifically X-box pad), telling me to press non-existant buttons to continue.Clicking on options/menu screen choices does nothing - you need to highlight the chosen option with the mouse and then press the enter key on the keyboard? (how intuative). OR just use keyboard only to navigate the menus.The game really wants you to use an X-box pad and pretty much assumes that everyone is or will - as all prompts and bindings you are shown throughout the game will be pad-related.The game itself :After a few matches I honestly felt that i'd had my fill. It's quite fun, but after a few rounds I felt no desire to play anymore. The whole experience just felt a bit stale and, well, meh....There are very few maps to play on and only the one game mode - sneaking about is fun, but gets boring rather quickly.After being pounced on from a rooftop - I had no urge to jump back in and avenge my death. I didn't really feel anything at all - Usually such an attack would spur me on, leaving me chomping at the bit watching the respawn time, eagily awaiting the opportunity for revenge. Just one more go, Just one more go!Sadly, that delicious 'just one more go' feeling is lacking from the Flock, at least for me. I just felt a bit bored and slightly regretful, thinking of other games I could have bought instead (and prob will having requested a refund on this).From what I have seen the Dev's are working to improve the game, so it might be worth keeping an eye on this one as with some polish, this could be a really neat experience.

One match pretty much sums up the experience at this point unfortunatly also deaths in the tutorial count against the finite population.If the price was lower I would recommend this game but as it stands there is not enough in the game to warrant almost $20 when there are numerous other indie titles that are same price or cheaper with far greater content at release.Pros: Devs say they'll add more stuff in future.Cons: Graphics are not the greatest but passable.

Most of the text in game doesn't display right. For some reason it kept throwing me back into the tutorial when I was looking through the settings, or waiting for a match, or trying to quit the game.Also, like some other people have said, the lives are dropping so slowly that you'll never see the end game content at this rate.And to be honest, when you do get into a game, it's just not very fun.Refunds are a thing now though, so if none of the above puts you off then go for it (just remember not to give away your free copy before you've played it or else you might not be able to get a refund)"

I have also noticed that the counter has stopped on their site and in game there are less and less players..... hope they will add something more innovative in the future.As of now I have to call this game a ripoff and I am truelly dissappointed. It seemed interesting but it is exact the same over and over again. Just a different environment so now and then.If this game gets below 2 bucks it MIGHT be worth buying it then, but as of now I don't recommend it, at least not for this price.Also after the life counter hits zero the game will be unavailable and a new thing will happen or so.. but at this rate, I don't think it will ever lose more than 1% of the total lives remaining.If the devs ever read this, it can be good this game, perhaps with different game modes, or more type of enemies. Maybe give the guy with the lantern some tool that makes him either more agile or aggresive towards the enemy, but balance it out. Maybe a type of enemy that is fast but has low health against light and one that is slow but high health against light or something like that, think out of the box. This is kinda like Evolve, but just the core concept (that is as of now, might change later and I will adjust my review properly if that happens).EDIT:1 and a half year later since my initial review and the devs have done nothing.

Any RTS will tell you that a weak unit needs numbers to be effective. So far this game does not have numbers.

Death comes quickly, sometimes without you even knowing from where, and the premise makes the game creepy. You get wrapped up in the game very easily.It does have some flaws, as others have mentioned. There are some glitches, there are few maps, and not everything works quite as expected. Primary question, however, given the premise this game is being launched with, is will people keep playing?As far as I'm concerned, I will. It's too limited to play for hours on end, but I'm more than satisfied to sit down here and there, play a half hour stretch, and then go cool off elsewhere. Hopefully the developers will fix some of the issues, so that the game's fully polished in time for us to enjoy the finale.EDIT: The vitriol this game has attracted is saddening. Here's a developer trying to do something new - create a multiplayer game with a coherent story that concludes - and everyone's shooting them down for trying. I find it a really interesting idea, and wish more people would give it a chance."
,Recommended,290490,17677452,"Posted: 23 August, 2015",all,Lawson1611,"The Flock is an interesting first title of a group of students from the netherlands, which is basically a digital version of red light / green light: You play the monsters of the flock, whose only goal is to kill and thus become the carrier. He carries a light which he can use to kill the flock if they are moving towards him and can unlock extra objectives to win the game. The monsters can try to evade the light by standing still or creating decoys. One round ends if one of the players found enough objectives and/or carried the light for a certain amount of time. That's all that is to it.Up till now there is not much content. There are only three maps, which feel very similar. The controls can be a little bit clunky, especially those of the monsters. Overall the gameplay is very repetitive: You hunt down the guy with the light, you have the light, seek objectives, you die and it starts over again. That said, it is fun to just play a few quick rounds, because most of the time they are just about five minutes long. Above all, it is fun to play with a few friends while speaking to them via headphones. This way you can creep each other out if one of you has the light and the others are coming to take it. So:If you play it with friends and can overlook the small content and weird controls, it is an enjoyable game. (Btw. if you buy it in the first week you get a second copy of the game you can gift one of your friends via steam, I probably would't have picked up the game for its full prize but two copys are a good deal and you can go play with a friend right away.)But the most interesting part of the game is its premise of its definite and already planned end and shut down. With every death of a flock in every game played a global ingame counter runs down to zero. If it reaches the bottom a last final event shall talk place and then the game will shut down, forever. It will not be playable after that. I find this an intriguing thought in a gaming world, where old games most of the time just slowly die away and finally get shut down quietly. ""The Flock"" promises the shut down to be an event (maybe similar to planned shut downs of old MMOs). Of course it is to be seen of the counter ever hits zero and what this finale will be. But I think the concept is worth to invest in to see, if similar concepts are worth looking into.What I am saying is this: ""The Flock"" is an experiment and it needs people to play it to see what can come of this. If you like games that can feel weird and not perfectly polished, but are willing to look beyond that and maybe help in your participation to discover new possibilites of game play and narration, than ""The Flock"" is worth a look. For everyone else, who rather have a polished, well thougth through and over a long period of time enganging game experience, I would advice to think twice before buying it.I will definitly sink another few hours in the game and hope that I'll be able to see what the developers have come up with in the end to bury their own creation in a stylish manner."

You play a member of 'the flock', think of the weeping angels from Dr. Who.Your aim as a member of the flock is to reach the light while avoiding being caught in its path by hiding or staying still when seen, by staying still you become petrified as a statue and immune to the burning light. When you reach the light you become a carrier of the light and you are slow and vulnerable, with only the light to defend yourself.The limited population, counting down with each death gives a real edge and consequence to gameplay. And knowing once the population dips to a certain level the game enters a different phase, a secretive 'grand finale' and after that the game is no longer playable, adds a real excitement to being part of the experience. There's definitely an incentive to keep playing and become familiar with the levels in order reach the light quickly and to stay alive as long as possible as a carrier.Yes there are visible teething problems, but I'm not getting half of what earlier players are reporting so it appears the devs are fixing them and at £12.99 with a free key for a friend for a game that only gets better the more people there are playing it I heartily recommend picking up a copy.See you in the grand finale!"

I really hoped it would get sorted out. The developers made lots of lists of what they were going to fix and delivered on some of that at the start but it is unclear if there is still any effort being made towards getting this game in a playable state.The GoodAtmospheric Sound DesignAesthetically pleasing Level DeginFluent Movement ControlWell fleshoud out asymmetric gameplayThis games visuals and sound are both unsettlingly pleasing and pleasingly unsettling. Although it is a dark and damned world the three areas have their own character without drastically altering gameplay. All the levels offer many intertwined corridors and paths under and over spacious areas.Together with the fluent Flock controls this gives a lot of liberty with where you can go. You are encouraged to keep moving because the game severely limits your view when standing still. Also there is the ability to swap control to a decoy, especially useful when trapped in the light. The fluid-like movement and the continuously evolving sounds makes running around make for a disturbing trance. Unfortunately while most areas have clear environmental queues for the level boundaries, there are instances I jumped into invisible walls at the extreme heights of the levels.Even more jarring than a collision with a invis-a-wall is switching to the light carrier's restricted movement.  He does however have its own set of tricks up his sleeve on par with those of the flock. The sounds for using the light artefact or the objectives are especially delicious.The BadMissing strings in localisation.Long queueing for short gamesInsane amounts of blur / limited contrast lead to hampered visual clarityNo frame limiter settings in graphics menu.The game defaulted to English for me, however the UI is still missing strings in a lot of places. Especially the tutorial.Furthermore the multilayer population seems a bit sparse. It can take me 5 minutes to wait for a match that lasts 5 minutes which isn't the only multilayer issue this causes.While the game looks beautiful it lacks some visual usability. The muted and dark colours are understandable but it is also hard to make out certain objects do to similar textures which is just too much. The Depth Of Field effect settings seem to be more of a suggestion for this game than an actual setting, which compounds this problem. Also because I like using a 120 fps monitor it is useful when a game offers frame-rate settings in its graphical menu.The UglyTerrible ping because of distant playersGlitchy key rebinding menuSimulation sickness guaranteeing locked FOVsConsumer unfriendly multiplayer modelThe underwhelming active player pool not only means long waiting times for matchups, but also getting matched with players far -faaaaaar-  away from the host. With 300+ ping it gets to the point that the attack that kills you shows op after you have died which is completely unacceptable given the games objectives and combat model.Besides missing strings the key rebinding menu poses another localisation error. Some keys on my keyboard would not be captured. Also the default keybindings map Flock and Light Carrier abilities to the same key, but this is not allowed when rebinding yourself. Together with a missing 'restore defaults' option this makes this whole keyboard menu infuriating to use.The game tries to limit visibility in various ways, including the field of view. These default FOVs however give me headaches using my current screen set-up. I do not feel like rearranging my desk just for a game that can last as short as 5 minutes, so in my opinion there should be a way to change the FOV. Maybe the visible area could be normalized for different user chosen FOVs by the means of an aesthetically pleasing variation on black bars.There has already been said much about the life cycle and end game design for this title. I feel that the developers choice ultimately is innately anti consumer.The only positive thing about it is that they are open and up front about what they intend to do with their server support from the moment this game went open for purchase.I can also respect the willingness to create an interesting and (hopefully) unique experience. I just don't think this is the most practical way to do so for your paying customers.The FlockIt has some technical issues thatNEEDto get fixed for me to keep playing this in the long run. The gameplay is engaging but I already hope for some tweaks later down the line when it is more clear what kind of community has formed around this game. When the developers fix this I will gladly recommend this game but with the current price and current features I would have tocautionanyone to thoroughly investigate if one of their critically desired features is not somehow missing from a game that is kind of OK to me."
76561198045966388,Not Recommended,290490,17666773,"Posted: 22 August, 2015",all,Acherrum,"EDIT: The developers seem to have disappeared. The game can no longer be recommended, sadly.I've been checking this game out and stalking the forums since just before release.This game is heavily underrated!People seem to get way too obsessed by the game having a finite lifetime.Let me just get this out of the way by making a few examples:- if you go to the movies with a friend, or your girlfriend, you pay 20 bucks for 2 hours of fun, excluding popcorn and drinks.- if you go to a concert, you pay 30 bucks for 3 hours of fun.About that counterWhen is the last time you played Shadow of Mordor, Assassin's Creed 2, or any other game older than 2 years? I'm sure you'll have at least 1 game in your library that you played once, a couple of hours, and then never touched it again. Games like Unreal Tournament were fun for a while - heck, back in the day I played that for half a year, daily, then I got bored and the playerbase dwindled and the game died. Now the developers of this game know this. They know that most games out there die a slow and silent death. They want to sell you an experience. You buy the game, you play it for a while and then, at a certain point, the 'population' will have decreased and the Flock dies out. But not before they update your game with a special 'finale'. Now, we don't know what that entails, but until that time, you will have played many hours (at least 2 to get 'cinema'-priced entertainment).Think of your favorite TV show that got cancelled without a finale, without closure. Anyone watch Hannibal? Great TV show, got cancelled, no closure. The developers of this game actually promise you a finale, closure to an interesting concept and story.I agree that the pricetag is rather steep - I feel cinemas are way too expensive these days - but at the same time, you now get 2 copies so play it with a friend for 2 hours instead of going to the latest X-Men movie. Same pricetag, just different form of entertainment. Play it for more than 2 hours, because you like it, and you'll have even more value for your money.Gameplay:I'm loving it. It's a shame the playerbase is still very small, because people got scared of the finite lifetime of the game, but the matches are AWESOME. I usually play with 2 or 3 others in a match, which means you hunt 1 person, or you are hunted by 2 or 3.Being the hunter makes you feel strong and devious. I can't help but smile and giggle as I'm closing in on my prey, knowing he knows I'm there.Being the carrier makes you feel weak and nervous. Knowing when the monsters get close, knowing they can pound you from pretty much anywhere, knowing there're more of them than of you and the only protection is a light that can actually fail you if you stand still for too long.Changing from hunter to huntee to hunter is what makes this game a lot of fun and very dynamic.GraphicsThe graphics are decent, although the models could have used some extra work. But the way you burst into flame when getting caught in the light looks pretty awesome and satisfying from both perspectives (1st person, or as carrier).SoundThe sound is great, very athmospheric. I really do get nervous when I hear the sounds change because the flock are closing in around me, not knowing exactly where they are, but knowing they are near and might already be watching. The Flock has this 'mating call' that totally gets me when used when they're already close. It also changes the visuals for a second, adding to the scare effect. It's brilliant!Price and content:The price is rather steep at 17 dollars/euros per copy. But for 2 copies, I feel it's worth it. However, do take in account that a lot of people have been put off by the counter and the pricetag, so the community is small (yet so far, a lot of players are friendly and can be added on Steam to arrange 5 player private matches that way). I definitely recommend getting this with a couple of friends for maximum effect.Content wise you get interesting gameplay, but only 3 maps at this moment. However, developers have said they will be adding more content after they've fixed all bugs over the next 2 weeks. We just do not know if this means more maps, different game modes or other mechanics/additions. These updates will be free, of course.Additional info:The bugs that have been mentioned are crashing upon trying to join a lobby. I've had this 2 times so far, and I know the developers are working on it. Luckily this game has very fast loading times, so it's easy to just start up again.This is an indie title, which was developed as a project for a University of the Arts. I believe they deserve more support than a lot of people are giving them, simply because people can't embrace different concepts.Don't let the finite lifetime scare you, consider this title as a piece of entertainment. 215.3 million deaths is going to take a while, long enough for 100.000 people to have a couple of hours of fun. The average match takes 10 minutes and counts 3 or 4 deaths - with 3 people. That's an average of 1.3 deaths per player per 10 minutes. That's about 27.6 million hours of gametime ;)"
