This thing still doesn't even look like it should have even been in Early Access. Don't put your wallet through so much pain by buying this so called ""game""."

What I find actually quite fascinating is the fact that this ""product"" actually gets WORSE again and again it is being worked on.Then it changed name and furtherly uses the early access excuse.While it might one day actually release, it will never, ever be passable. There is something wrong with every single aspect of it.*** UPDATE! ***Since apparently the new patch invalidates my old review, here's a new one. Note how it is, just like the game, basically identical. See you at full release when I go over it one last time. :)*** UPDATE 2 ***Here's some gameplay from the release. Starting to look passable isn't it..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PGfDy6K_s0"

With such an engine the game should rock and destroy all indie FPS built on FPS Creator and Unity engine!Eh boy I was wrong! What was I thinking? For a game that packs 10gb of data you get a badly designed menu, badly designed weapons, badly designed sound effects, badly designed levels, lot of clipping issues, not to mention the game is laggy as hell. At this stage,Time Ramesside is possibly the worst FPS of its kind to be released on Steam Greenlight.I thought The Slaughtering Grounds and Devils Share from Digital Homicide Studios were bad... It seems there's a new contender in the market!Since its release in 2014 and re-release in 2015, Time Ramesside (A New Reckoning) has undergone many changes. The latest build has nothing to do with the first build anymore. In other words, the game just got worse after every updates. Don't expect any improvement, just more glitches.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WxWvLiG_awRating :1.0"

Sadly, even with my love of trash, this game was disappointing.  I can handle glitch filled, broken games, but this game just isn't fun.  I had lost all hope of having fun when I shot a wall.  THE WALL BLED!!!  It was amazing!  I ran down the hall shooting everything, and everything send out streams of blood!  GAME OF THE YEAR!!!Than the game crashed.....I guess all good things must come to an end."

It's atrocious, mother of all ""bad steam games"". Floating buildings, copy paste textures, copy paste levels (!), brain dead AI, npc raining from the sky - you name it. And all of this on brand new Unreal 4 engine that looks great but even this did not save this mess.Even the developer don't know what this game suppose to be - it started as a simple shooter, then he re-done all of it adding spells, then again changed it to be third person shooter, to finally revert it back to previous state but with horror vibe to it. Yes what a wild ride.Its mind boggling this product, its actually maybe worth 0.99 cents to see how twisted and perverted it is.I actually tried to help the developer with some other gamers giving him tips and ideas - as much as I was surprised he went out and tried to apply them. End result was even more mind boggling glitches and bugs.My dad told me once - do it properly or don't do it at all. Panzer Gaming Studios	 should just stop.Play it if you want to see how not to make a game."

I was taken aback by a non-functional options screen at the opening menu. Actually that should have been my first clue of what was to come when I selected ""New Game"". Sort of like the scary music which plays in Grade-B horror movies as the nubile co-ed climbs the stairs to check on someone. You're yelling at the TV screen: ""Don't go up the stairs"" because we all know what's waiting at the top of the stairs. I wish someone had been yelling to me: ""stay away from this half-finished piece of umm, garbage"". But the video looked interesting so I blindly bought. They say one's born every minute. I could go on to list the many faults of this game that I encountered in the first fifteen minutes of play. Others have already done a more than adequate job. It takes a really terrible game before I'll stop playing without giving it a chance. This beast is one such game. If you think you might like to experience this game, whack your head with a mallet until you're unconscious. Hopefully when you regain your senses whatever urge you may have felt to purchase this ""game"" will have passed."

It was my first indie/early access attempt and it cost me months to gain the confidence to dive into another indie title. Games like these strengthen the arguments of early access/indie haters.

,Not Recommended,290650,18080486,"Posted: 17 September, 2015",all,Stephen Stills,Time Ramesside ( A Horrible Game ). This game has a plot that I can only describe as non existent. It has nothing to do with the afformentioned Mark Faroh being a scientist at all. The game in fact is just you running through different areas killing the enemies which quickly wears on you and becomes a chore with the small choice of weaponry that all seem to be useless in my opinion. So anyway you fight all of the poorly modeled and textured enemies in the poorly modeled and textured world with your crappy guns. Needless to say there really isn't much to say about this abomination. Just save your 3 bucks for something else unless you can get this game for 30 cents or less I couldn't reccomend you touch this game with a 9 and a half foot pole. Decent for a laugh with friends this game is nothing more than a joke and not even a good one. 2/10 Not even sure this is a game.

Having shelled out a whole £4.79 for something I've still yet to actually receive, which has precisely 0 Bytes in its folder.. let's just say I'm not exactly angry or disappointed, nor am I really considering legal proceedings against the developer for releasing a product of such questionable quality, dubious design and ontologically unstable first premises.The truer reason for this lack of immediate existential tension over the inability of the developers to deliver ""Time Ramesside"" is that part of me - my soul of sentient electric blue - quietly feels for Panzer Gaming Studios, and for a million other mother's dirty basement Game Development operations, lingering unknown and unloved in obscure backwater zones of this lurid digital planet.It makes you think, doesn't it? These everyday failures, these common and garden breakdowns, missteps, deficiencies and grey ruptures - nonperformance lead balloons that travel nowhere fast. It's enough to make you consider your own useless virtual ambitions, those vacant and vacated daydreams without direction or impetus. Vectors in null space.Ever read Fernando Pessoa’s ""The Book of Disquiet""? I found it fascinating - an emotional canvas of delicate construction, cool and labyrinthine in its well considered tones. Much like the work of Jason Welge seems to be (ie. unconsciously.) There's lines in Pessoas's novel, about ""this indefinite lucid blue pallor of the aquatic evening"", which ""point up the irregularities of the unruly whole."" The indistinct lackings and paltry failures of Time Ramesside seem to echo this. And the echoes travel deep into the soul, and I reflect them back for you to witness here, today.Apologies to my fellow Players for this unfocused sensual rambling. Bizarre states of uncommon Play - those often symbolized by Permanent Early Access Crapolaware - make one dizzy with the poignant metaphysical alchemy of their luxurious, squirty inadequacies.Do I recommend this game? Yes - ""I recommend this game smartens up its #ing act, tout de suite."" As for what This Game more actually is - an act of treason against modern functioning design, a Capitalist performance art without precedent, a total breakdown in dimensional hyperreality - ah, well that's another question for you to ponder, dear friends.Thank you for playing this Unorthodox, yet hopefully Effective review.Sincerely, Robert H.

It is early access and seems to have no forward direction on it's own. I have too agree with sitebender on what he has commented.

Everything you shoot bleeds, The walking speed suggest your bald, spider-demon daughter tied ankle weights to your feet, while running throws your flashlight around like a madman, enemies are either stuck in walls or do no damage, and putting an enemy out of it's misery of awful game development deletes them. That being said, the game provides a good laugh. So even though the game it's self is terrible I still recommend you get it because you can probably finish the game and get a refund.
