I saw the main developer of this game, Simon Strange in person at G Fest and let me tell you, next time I see him I'm going to as for my money back. Over 140,000 dollars donated to back this game and so far, nothing. This is why I don't support indie developers, there's always the risk of takign the money and skipping out."
,Recommended,290810,12588149,"Posted: 20 October, 2014",all,Gigan75pcp,"Now, I have a long history of loving Godzilla and its series whether it is the movies, or the videogames. The Godzilla Unleashed producer Simon Strange decided to bring back the feeling of the games by making his own version of a monster fighting game, bringing back all the mechanics from Godzilla Save the Earth, and the feeling of being a monster in a free-for-all or 2v2 fight. The game is in Alpha which means its still being produced, so a few bugs and a lack of content will probably be noticed throughout your gameplay. There is only one map to play on as of now, a total of only 4 playable characters, single player is pretty ideal since you do in fact need other controllers to play the game with friends, and I cannot speak about its online mode and my experience since literally nobody plays online. Aside from those things, as a Godzilla fan, I choose not to care about those things, because knowing the creator of this game and the fan base Godzilla has now and days, this game will be huge to all Godzilla and Kaiju fans when it is finally finished. I recommend to buy it now, and stick with it no matter how long the project takes. They already added a Workshop page to it, so it tells you that they must be making progress :)"

,Not Recommended,290810,11685444,"Posted: 13 August, 2014",all,PhoenixJape da Big Boss,"This game is going to be dope. Don't buy into the Early Access unless you want to support the devs, though. Kaijuland Battles will be free, post-Early Access, so don't rush into anything. Later on, there will be more releases for Colossal Kaiju Combat that will act as individual, yet modular games. In other words, you can play them separately, or all at once. If they make a decent enough profit with this brand we could end up playing as Godzilla and Mr. Stay Puft in future releases.I really want atomic roasted marshmallows. Please buy.EDIT: This game is going nowhere fast. Either they hit a hell of a snag or they stopped caring. I assume the former, but I'm still a little disappointed. The ETA of Fall of Nemesis was supposed to be November, yet Kaijuland Battles hasn't even left Early Access. I'm more than willing to return to recommending this game if things change, but I'm becoming sceptical of that ever happening."

Like these developers are gone and no longer working on this. Don't buy the game because it's more unfinished than Sonic 06"
,Not Recommended,290810,17242695,"Posted: 26 July, 2015",all,MrParanormalPro™,"so far im gonna say. There is no diffuculty option or resolution option, and when you use a beam attack on an enemy they just run through it and own you. the game can also be boring because you cant fight bots eg, play against a chosen bot with a chosen difficulty. like G:STE."

First of I did say you would need a controller to play this. I wouldn't mind, but it is unfair to gamers who cannot afford a contoller to play the game or get one. Has unnecessary auto lock not allowing free roam unless you hold the sprint button. Some of the moves you have to figure out by messing around with button combinations or look up on forums since there are no instructions in game.  I understand this is in early access, but this is gonna make the game worse without proper updates to fix minor issues that are becoming more a larger issue. I would recommend dumbing down the controls so that way they are able to be used on keyboard and mouse not just only controller.Old Review Below:Controls nice, rare to see giant monster games anymore, and seems to have alot of potential for the future. This is only an alpha so far so waiting for more updates yet two issues i have.1. The fact a controller is kinda stupid specially since you need to pay $24.99 or $39.99 for a pc controller a decent one atleast.2. Monsters can only turn different directions by first sprinting which is kinda annoying cause there not being another monster to target or having a cpu.These are only minor issues not big deals though so don't threat it will be a good game."

76561198023895609,Recommended,290810,16606348,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,Peewee Vermin,"Honestly, the biggest flaws with this game are the controller requirement and the lack of maps. I'm still waiting for destructible, city environments, to make it feel more like a kaiju game.However, the controls and combat are very solid. There's a lot of room for strategic fighting with the characters, due to the diversity and balance of moves.  Overall, I find the combat to be pretty fun.And while the game WILL be F2P in the future, it's $5 in early access so the game can be paid through development.I would encourage people to try this game for what it is because, with less people playing it, it will only take longer to gather the needed info for the game to reach it's full potential. There's substantial evidence, through fairly regular updates to mechanics, animation, and textures, that this game still has a lot of work going into it. The only thing it's lacking is overall content."
,Recommended,290810,17567710,"Posted: 16 August, 2015",all,dash.galaxy,"I recommend this game, but you may as well wait until it's free. The only reason it isn't free right now is because it's in Alpha and the lead/sole developer (Simon Strange of Godzilla: Save the World fame) doesn't want people to join the game before it's finished and leave prematurely, thinking it sucks.There'll be 4 maps and 4 monsters in the free game when all is said and done from what I've heard. The 4 monsters are already here and they play pretty well. There's some tracking issues wither monster targeting and camera stuff, but the combat system itself is actually pretty great and deeper than I initially thought.With this game you will have a free ticket into the Kaiju Combat universe. This game will be backward compatible with all future non-free releases in the series, meaning if your friend has Fall of Nemesis you'll be able to play with him using the free characters and he can use the FoN characters. Simon has said he plans as many as 12 games in the franchise.Future maps will include of course a city environment with destructible buildings and it's important to mention that the game is 4-player. This game has developed VERY VERY slowly, and you have every right to be upset and skeptical about it, but give it a chance. If you don't feel compelled to buy it for 5 bucks now, fine, but pay it a visit when it finally is released. It's still under active production. I've spoken to Simon as recently as a few hours ago. It's happening and there is now a fair revenue stream coming from the CKC card game.Anyway, there's another update coming out next week or a week later! That should see some performance boosts and maybe even a bit of new content. I urge you to put some faith in this franchise because us Kaiju fans really need it to do well, and Simon Strange is really the only person who has done it well in the past."

I could hardly get the damn game to work, and I didn't have an Xbox controller, so I had to configure a bunch of options in a damn emulator program, and even when it did work, nothing felt finished. These mechanics are lousy at best and the graphics look like they were done in MS Paint by a seven year old. Development is also dead, which doesn't surprise me, so there's no hope anything will ever be fixed or even slightly corrected. Also, because I've played it for like seven minutes and didn't ask for a refund within two weeks, I can't get my money back, and now all the game is doing is taking up space on my Library.Final Verdict- 0/10, Just awful. Screw any sort of description here, it isn't worth the time."
