Rather than set a goal over the whole experience, the game makes it a bit more about the journey.Pros:+ Shows some real evolution of the original concept with more tiles and new special attacks+ New zones keep the enviornment interesting and the journey long+ Heavy upgrade to the presentation of the game as everything feels nicer to execute+ Better soundtrack than 10000000, even if it also gets a little repetitive. Has much more fitting music for the art style.+ Earning your keep very much pushed in this game as you must do well to progress and unlock new crew members+ Keeps an adventure feel to it rather than dangling a goal over you like in 10000000+ Only tweaking the formula to avoid any unneccessary confusion, adding more, but not too much, for veterans.+ Much more varied color pallet.+ Enemies now have weaknesses and immunities.Cons:- Some goals still seem arbitrary.- While nice, the new library for looking at item effects, enemy types, and weaknesses is, in the end, pointless considering you're at the mercy of the tiles.- Still a bit more luck based than skill based.- Not too much has changed visually.- The way upgrading is handled stinks of a game that had microtransactions but were seemingly removed for the Steam version.- Upgrading still feels way too slow considering the cost, now adding a minigame as if still meant for a touch device.7/10."

,Recommended,290890,32838519,Posted: 26 June,all,Aurumlamina,"As the spiritual successor to 10,000,000, You Must Build A Boat is a match three-style puzzle game with RPG mechanics slapped onto it.  The goal of the game is, you guessed it, to build a boat to take you across the map that pops up between dungeons.  Its strengths and improvements over the previous title are immediately noticed, but its flaws become more apparent as the game progresses.Lacking any real narrative, progression of your character and ship are the primary motivators of moving forward.  Each run nets you a handful of resources that you can use to upgrade your boat, your equipments, your spells, and so on.  This is the real strength of the game as there are significant increases to both the quantity and variety of upgrades available.  I found myself compelled to keep playing multiple times as an exciting upgrade always seem to be just around the corner.Unfortunately, the greatest strength of You Must Build A Boat ultimately breaks down into its greatest weakness.  As you approach the late game, the exciting progression bogs down into a crawl and the monotony sets in.  It's not at all rare to do the same run of a dungeon a dozen or more times hoping for the randomly generated order of monsters, traps, and treasure to be on your side.  The fact that you've now also run out of available upgrades but have managed to amass a wealth of resources only hastens the encroaching boredom.As negative as some of that may have sounded, I really did have fun throughout the majority of this game.  If you played 10,000,000 and enjoyed it, this one is definitely worth picking up and spending a few hours on.  If you're into puzzle-RPGs, I'd recommend the title as well as it's a solid game for a price that certainly isn't going to break the bank.  For everyone else, I would definitely suggest doing some research on the game to see if it's really your cup of tea."

That's it, if that's exactly what you want then read no further - this is the game for you.Onto the review proper.  I have never played 10000000, I do no know what type of game it is and maybe I should have done more research because the description 'About This Game' was not what I was lead to expect at all when I bought You Must Build A Boat.YOU DO NOT BUILD A BOAT.  For every stage you pass your boat gets bigger and more furnished.  You have no input in how this happens.You do not actively gather a crew or capture monsters.  These events happen as you match tiles but, again, you have no strategic or tactical input.  There is no skill involved.You can upgrade your weapon, cast magic and upgrade your board.  But ultimately there is little choice in how you do any of these things.  The game boils down to: buy the cheapest upgrade so that you can eke out a little more time in the next match 3 game and then buy the next cheapest upgrade.The match 3 game which is the core and only gameplay of You Must Build A Boat (as there is no boat building or monster wrangling) is frustrating rather than fun.Certain enemies are weak to certain tile combinations - swords for an enemy weak against physical for example.  But the very tight timelimits left me frantically mathching anything I could in the hope that any damaging tiles - regardless of appropriateness - would fall onto the board.  There is no time to build combinations effectively and no guarantee you'll be given magic or ability tiles when needed.This is not a thoughtful puzzle game.  The timelimits are too tight and the board too random.  If you're waiting in a station or a queue at a shop this would be a good time waster but on a PC where I am choosing to spend my time on entertainment for enjoyment; it's just frustratingly flat."

,Recommended,290890,33513561,Posted: 13 July,all,Whiteswart,"It's really hard to explain the game better than it was made in the ""about this game"" store section. The trailer video is also helping.Run the line from left to right, match 3 tiles in a row, complete some quests on the way. Just like its predecessor, ""10 000 000"" game, ""You must build a boat"" is a really simple to start causal-style project, that gets harder and harder with every level. And that is the main downside of the game: even with all upgrades farmed, with the top blessings for your run, you're still too hard into luck and not in the skill. I've finished 10 000 000 just out of pure luck, and I've stopped somewhere in the Gallery level, trying to catch the east wind here, in the ""YMBaB"". It's getting annoying after a while, so I understand some negative votes on the game...But, as player who have seen much stuff, I really can't call this game bad. No-no-no, in fact, it's good and enjoying - especially if you like somewhat original approach on the evergreen field of casual ""match-3-in-a-row"" games. ""You must build a boat"" is fun. It's good, and I can recommend it almost to everyone - especially with a discount or a bundle purchase. It's definetely worth some time and money of yours... If you don't take games too serious and only want to spend your coffie-brake time in some action. Don't expect to beat the game just as easy as you started it, however.My mark is 6.5/10. Good for some time when you simply can't play some AAA-size. However, if you're choosing a gift for some really casual player (like your Ma, or maybe GrandPa) - I'd go with the more refined ""10 000 000"". Here, in the ""YMBaB"", there is too many upgrading which isn't doing you any good. Too much grinding and less actual fun gameplay. Which is sad. But still tolarable, still worth a try."

It wants to have the feel of an older game, as one can tell by the minimalist pixel art style and the 8-bit music. Your objective: run through a temple, gather treasure while fighting monsters, and use your gold to progress upriver by... building a boat. Who knew...To it's credit, YMBAB works well with its chosen style. Old games are, on the whole, more challenging than most new releases. And you will find that YMBAB is challenging... it will take awhile to master.As you continue you gain crew members who make you stronger and give you a place to spend gold... you even collect monsters to help you.However, many players may be turned off after about an hour or two of gameplay due to repetition. Runs are essentially identical, different places are really just palette swaps, and too many times you will try to complete a quest only to just not be given the proper tiles. That's my major gripe with this game. How random things are, often times preventing you from advancing to the next area simply because the tiles won't line up right. I'm sorry, but I can't predict if a cascade will get me my mandatory 4th triple match of the run before I get pushed off screen to start over.Also, I've noticed only two music tracks in the game: one for your boat, one for going on a run. I'm not against 8-bit music, but only two tracks is aggrevating.I have yet to reach the end of this game, and maybe I never will. Perhaps all that's there is a ""GOOD JORB BUDDY"" sign and a button to start again. I don't recommend YMBAB, but go ahead and play it if you want... just be aware of the grind you are about to suffer through."

I enjoyed 1000000, but this game is like someone decided to draw it out as long as possible while removing half the things that made the original tolerable.  Oh right and when I beat the last quest the game softlocked.  GOOD JOB.The drink system is absolute rubbish now, with mostly-useless effects and less flexibility- drinks last a set number of runs so once you drink one you're stuck with it for that amount of time.Monsters have a large variety of effects, which means for the most part there's no strategy for taking them out.  You just have to match attack tiles in general.Upgrades are now basically worthless for the gold they cost, and you have almost no gold income aside from quest rewards until the very end of the game!  This means you can't grind until then, and when you DO get there, you HAVE TO grind, because the last quest is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.Oh right, quests.  Instead of collecting resources to unlock upgrade types, you have to do quests, which usually involve satisfying some unique action during a dungeon run.  That's generally fine, though some rely on blind luck.  However, their main purpose seems to be roadblocking upgrades.  After a certain point, the equipment upgrades all require ""silver"" which only drops from quest rewards until you get an upgrade near the end of the game that lets you get it from matching crate tiles.  Thus, silver restricts what upgrades you can get, which makes grinding mostly useless.  Furthermore, base stat upgrades are hard-locked to completing ""monster capture"" quests, so you can't grind for them at all.Take the combination of the following factors:1) Traps are so punishing you have to have a variety of tiles ready to match at all times, which requires luck.2) The RNG is streaky which means you get a lot of garbage or a lot of accidental match chains, which can either roadblock you or make progress smooth.3) Quest items are looted from boxes which require a lot of matches of specific tiles.4) The last quest item is put so deep in the dungeon you have like 10 seconds to match the required tiles.  The dungeon is pushing you back just that fast.5) Dungeon effects are randomly generated, but they stay the same until you complete a quest.6) Monsters near the end of the game take like 5 or 6 attacks to kill and have no weaknesses for the most part.7) Items can be stockpiled for emergencies between runs once you get the upgrade that allows it, but all items STAY IN THE GRID, GETTING IN THE WAY.All these factors combined means that if you get a bad roll for your last set of dungeon effects, the final quest becomes PURE LUCK."

If you played the previous game in the series you are not getting much more really.  While the feature of building a boat is new, it actually doesn't add anything to the actual gameplay.  You still move your little dungeon runner to the right while matching tiles to either deal damage, or collect items.This is fun however, don't get me wrong.

You must also search the world over for 1 of each monster worth saving, allowing them to board your boat and subsequently reap the benefits from their quirky talents. You’re further required to constantly upgrade your own weapons, shield defence and spell power as you venture the world’s sinister dungeons looking for coinage and monsters worth recruiting. Hence after many significant 3 match battles you will eventually build up your boat from a dinghy to a titanic leisure cruiser.The objective is to 3 match the necessary tiles in accordance to the obstacles present as your character runs through each dungeon. Each monster you face will require you to match up sword, staff and shield tiles, whereas treasure chests stumbled upon will require you to match up a series of key tiles depending how many locks are on each treasure chest.The game is a sequel to '10000000' and follows roughly the same premise. Unlike other games which have an intricate woven story encouraging a gamer to push forward, instead the only motivation here is simply the next upgrade to be made.For achievement hunters there are two achievements which will undoubtedly give you some grief. One requires you to do an 800m run on the last level 'The Gallery'. To complete this I strongly suggest at the end of your first completion of the game to drink a potion that entitles you to more staffs and maybe drink a potion that lowers the danger level somewhat. The second difficult achievement requires you to play the game two more times upgrading the difficulty of the entire game both times.The game with its wild shenanigans was rather fun to play for the majority, it tested mainly just hand and eye co-ordination and the occasional anger management issues as I held a glass of water precariously over my keyboard and shouted fruitful expressions of displeasure at the 8 bit monsters bouncing up and down my boat like vegetative lemmings.In final, a cheap game with a catchy soundtrack, which entertained me with the odd chuckle and smirk here and there. It definitely impressed me enough to want to look at all the rest of their games in future. Below is my 800m Gallery Run, it should be enough of a sample for you to work out if this is a game for you.https://youtu.be/zCnkjqIY0iY"

The more you advance, the bigger your boat gets, the more people you can recruit etc. Through the way you're gonna find / recruit NPCs that can help you on your journey by providing you a few power-ups. Each part of the map has a different set of monsters and you have a bestiary that you can fulfill throughout your way.  The graphics are forgivable, I don't really think that they affect anything. The sound effects aren't really inspiring and the music gets old really quickly. Overall, this isn't really a bad game. I just find it somewhat redundant and even though you can upgrade your gear, you usually rely on luck at every run you make, in order to fulfill the estabilished goals. It's kinda good to kill some time, but it doesn't really have much replay value."

Timed match-3 is fast paced and rewards you even when you don't succeed with your run-goals.  Actually, they say you won each run, even if you failed your objectives, because you still collect treasure, gold, etc. that comes back to your boat where different vendors you've picked up along your travels will sell you upgrades to melee & magic weapons, spells, shield and more.  The chip tune music is catchy (I could listen to it for hours-long game stints without tiring of it) and matches the game perfectly.  This game mixes luck (random tiles) with skill (your timing, choice of attack, strategy against different foes, etc) which is nice because it doesn't get boring.  The RPG elements of upgrading your equipment and run bonuses are great.  The one-step-at-a-time introduction to new gameplay mechanics, plus the simplicity makes this game easy to get into - while the ""one more run!"" addictive gameplay and charming music keep you playing once you start.  Lastly, I like that it's ""different"".  Your ship's crew looks to be made up of monsters.  You're not really told what the story is, and I think as I finish the game it will be revealed - and I'm looking forward to learning what I'm sailing towards and why I've built the boat.  I'm surprised the regular price is only $4.99.  I think they could have asked for twice this and had very few with buyer's remorse.  I snatched it up during the Thanksgiving sale of 2015 for $2.49, but it's a great little game and already a bargain at full price."

Sounds strange, but works pretty well.Your character runs through a dungeon, fights monsters, opens chest and overcomes other obstacles while you match the corresponding tiles. In each run you are given a set of up to three missions to fulfil which grant special features to a run and affects the difficulty - the more you try at once, the harder it gets. But you also get more out of a run. Upon completion of all missions for a certain stage, you process through the next of ten settings. Missions also grant you new recruits or resources which you can invest into enhancing your character (which boils down to doing more damage on a match) to ease your next run.Sadly that's it about the game. You keep running the dungeons, trying to complete the increasingly luck-depended missions. The increasing difficulty is offset by the better stats and bonuses and thus a run in the first dungeon feels not much different from on in the last. Once you complete the game, you unlock the daily run challenges and can start a new ""prestige"" game with slightly increased difficulty. Talking about repetitive gameplay.The progression is strictly linear and you have to complete the missions in a particular order. You have to do a mission no matter what and you move on to the next stage no matter what, once the current one is completed. A simple farm run to get some upgrades is out of the question, which leads to some hopeless runs later down the line.There are sadly some issues with the game which can infuriate you. Like not being able to pass an obstacle because you simply don't have the tiles for it or just not seeing any matches, while you are doomed to watch the time ticking away. I've also encountered some small bugs which lead to the game hanging, but they could all be fixed with a simple restart.It's not a bad game at all, and good to waste some time on. But I feel it's a step back from its predecessor 10,000,000 and there are better Match-3 games out there."
,Recommended,290890,17091075,"Posted: 17 July, 2015",all,Flashback007,"Short review: Fun game. You can compare it to 10,000,000 but it added some new mechanics that my draw in new players.Long review:NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS (for as much as this game has any)Let me go a bit more indepth now. On the surface the gameplay between both games is exactly the same, you go in a dungeon with Explorer and do the puzzle shoving and solving with the 'match-three'-game. Meanwhile you will beat enemies, get gold and other goodies. Gold is basically used for the same thing as in the previous game, you buy upgrades with it. One thing changed in that perspective. If you played 10,000,000 you know you collected wood and stone to upgrade your shops and things like that. However in this game, you will unlock your shops through getting certain achievements in the dungeon. And you have way more shops then in the first game, also you will catch some loot like random rings and stuff. Eventually you will unlock someone you can sell that stuff to for gold.So with the wood and stone collection gone, you have three new tiles. You have a 'Meat', 'Power' & 'Crate'-tile added to the mix of your normal staff, sword, key and shield. 'Meat' & 'Power' are basically for the best new addition to the game, namely the monster buddies. Completing objectives and achievements will unlock certain monsters, which you can eventually purchase. These monsters are basically your upgrades for certain things. Like +10 Staff Power or +10 Trap Time and stuff like that. These become very useful eventually also in later dungeons. What remains are the 'Crate'-tiles. These basically replace the item-slots you got when opening chests in the first game. Nothing special, only thing is they take up a place on your board. This can be a bit annoying when shoving around but it will help you immensly.How about the gameplay then? Like I said it didn't chance much, they added some tweaks and turns. But on the surface it's exactly the same as 10,000,000. Only thing I like better in this game then the previous one is the fact that you have more then one dungeon. You basically travel with your boat (starting of as a simple rowing boat) down the stream and go plunder the dungeons along the way. Completed all the objectives in one dungeon, you travel on. For me personally I like this better. In 10,000,000 I usually had no problem beating the first level of the dungeon, but came across trouble beating the next levels, which essential made me put down the game. Here you can just go and keep on doing the same dungeon over and over. Ofcourse eventually you will run into higher speed and difficult enemies. But it won't block you, cause you will start on Lvl 1 of every dungeon and you will not travel futher and get more challenging objectives before you beaten the dungeon, basically serving as a watchman for your difficulty. Only downside I see to this is, that if you eventually encounter a dungeon that's to hard for you, you can't go back to the previous. I would love to have seen this to be added, but I can see why they didn't.Overall a very positive vibe from this game. It's much like 10,000,000 and if you liked that one, you more then likely are gonna like this one. If you didn't like the first one, you can always give it a shot.

Though the ideas behind it - monsters that are vulnerable to certain attacks, chests to unlock, traps to dismantle etc. - are entertaining enough, the time limits and pure randomness of tile drops will often lead to a frantic effort to match anything in the vain hope you'll get what you need on the next drop. This can lead to some 'quests' being completed easily on the first try, whilst others must be attempted tens of times until the tiles fall exactly as needed. This robs the game of much of its fun and what remains is a vexxing exercise in frustration."

I Must Be Crazy For Liking It.Genre: Combination of RPG, Rogue-lite and Match-Three Elements.Developed & Published by: EightyEight GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.Business Model: Single Purchase.Copy Purchased by Myself, Playtime Was Mostly On AndroidPreambleI used to like mobile-centric games, back in 2013. It was a new frontier of gaming and a lot of new ideas were being used to figure out what could be done. However, I eventually became fatigued of the current running trend which is freemium everything. Freemium mechanics and business model, an extremely toxic and unenjoyable combination of ideas. It completely turned me off from trying new games for a while. It didn’t help that I felt like there weren’t any games being made for a core gamer such as myself. Games where I can sit down for more than five minutes and actually get a deeper, more challenging experience as I went along. Most of the time, the game shows its hand and I’ll get bored of it pretty quickly. A friend eventually cajoled me out of my negative attitude towards it and sharing a bunch he recommended. So, I decided to give Android another go, to look in the inner depths of the platform and find games that PC-centric gamers like myself might find interesting. It's true that You Must Build A Boat isn’t exactly a hidden gem. However, I think it’s a good starting point for me to start from. Let’s talk about building boats and killing monsters.Overall Gameplay ThoughtsYou Must Build A Boat is a combination of RPG, rogue-lite and match three mechanics. The player starts on a boat and is tasked with, well, building a much bigger boat. To accomplish this, he must run an endless procedurally generated dungeons, defeat monsters and acquire loot. Incrementally and eventually growing strong enough through capturing monsters, recruiting crewmates, finding relics and upgrading your capabilities to take on the challenges ahead. There are two phases to this game, running the dungeons and buying upgrades with the recently acquired loot. As this is a rogue-lite, the objective isn’t to “win” the dungeon, but get as far as you can and acquire as much material as possible. The RPG mechanics are in how you can upgrade your weapons, defense and spells that you can use in the dungeon. There’s a good tutorial that runs you through the various mechanics and currencies in the game.The main portion of the game that the player will be playing in is the dungeon running. This side-scrolling endless dungeon has the player running to the right as long as they can. As soon as they get pushed off to the left, their run is done and they can either retry or return to the boat to acquire upgrades. This is the player’s health bar essentially. Each run will have an objective(s) that the player must strive to achieve. These objectives can unlock new shops on the ship, gold or power depending.  As you progress through the dungeon, there are procedurally generated enemies, chests and traps that will try to hinder your movement. You must match the appropriate tiles in order to defeat these obstacles. For enemies, this is usually matching sword or magic staff tiles to do damage. For chests, it’s key tiles. Traps and certain chests will have an icon associated to them telling the player what they must match to defeat them. Enemies won’t simply stand around and let you kill them, they’ll throw their own attacks that will knock the player farther to the left. You can match shield tiles to prevent “damage” but these must be refreshed pretty often to keep the shield up. There are three other tile sets as well: knowledge, strength and crates. Matching knowledge and strength tiles give you a currency for upgrades or recruiting “found” monsters which grant bonuses. Matching crates gives the player a chance to find items to sell or spells that can be used in the dungeon run at the player’s discretion. These spells vary from freezing spells to fireballs. While the player is running, they are constantly charging a horn spell that, when the horn is charged and the player is in danger, will clear the immediate screen of enemies. This can sometimes be a clutch play or completely wasted on a single enemy. It depends.The general idea when you’re playing the match-three section is to have as many sword/staff/key matches available to deal with whatever obstacle you’ll run into. While the guy is running between obstacles, the player should clear the board of crate, strength and knowledge tiles as much as possible for their benefits and so they can have access to the sword/staff/key tiles. Matching four or five tiles in a row increases the potency of these tiles as well as tile multipliers that are unlocked later in the game. All the while, the player is up against a constantly changing timer due to the aforementioned “health” bar.Upgrades can be purchased to improve the player’s sword, shield, staff, spells and even dungeon runs in general. There’s a choice of three different upgrades for most of these items but generally they are all stat upgrades with some having certain effects. All upgrades are worth getting, it’s just a matter of whether you can afford them.Game ThoughtsYou know, I rather enjoyed YMBAB. As far as mobile games go, it pushes the player to keep getting better at match-three. Since you’re up against a health bar timer where faster and better matches are constantly encouraged, it makes the player improve along with the character you’re playing as. Sometimes, runs can just be bad because you won’t get the natural matchups you need but more often than not, you can make it work. It’s about making the best of a difficult dungeon. Once I finished the campaign, I felt I had gotten enough of the experience but boy, it was a pretty darn good experience. While the upgrade/RPG mechanics aren’t exactly that deep, it at least gives you something else to think about and strive for in each run so that each subsequent run is that much better. It’s still a pretty simple experience when you get right down to it, but it’s got the right combination of mechanics, skill ceiling and ideas so that even someone like myself can enjoy it.PC Settings and Audio/VideoGame Options:What the User Can Configure:Resolution Options: Reasonable selection.A list of resolutions limited to your max resolutionScreen Mode: Windowed/Fullscreen ModeBorderless Windowed is part of windowed mode.V-Sync, Shader Effects IncludedOn/Off ToggleParticle Count.User selected for low/med/high.Audio Options. Music & SoundAdjustable sliders.Final ThoughtsHonestly, I think You Must Build a Boat is a better experience on mobile devices. That’s not to say that the PC port is bad (it’s not). However, the mouse feels like a poor substitute for the touch-driven design. You could still play it with a mouse, but I think you’ll enjoy it more on your phone/tablet than on a PC. Still, this combination of fast-paced match-three mechanics and rogue-lite mechanics make for a fun time. And You Must Build A Boat is one that a decent amount of hidden depth for a mobile game. It keeps me interested despite its simplicity through its push to the player to keep getting better and faster at matching tiles together. So, give You Must Build A Boat a look.Read the full & unabridged review, among others, on A Paladin Without A Crusade"
,Recommended,290890,33071360,Posted: 30 June,all,KaioShin,"Very nice casual action puzzle game for when you have 15 minutes to fill. It's basically Puzzle Quest meets rogue-lite. You dwelve into a dungeon, defeating monsters and opening treasure chests by combining fields on a game board. The spoils of your runs then get used in your headquarters between runs to unlock permanent upgrades - more damage on attacks, better spells, etc. That makes it very motivating and engaging. While the graphics are pretty ugly, the soundtrack is great (though there are only 3 tracks, but they all rock). The campaign takes about 5 hours to beat, but then there are also daily challenges and still more stuff to unlock if you want to play more. The game is also super cheap, less than a dollar during sales. You can do no wrong here."

You make 15 off matched in that time, and you have 3 attach tiles that will line up. Awesome, thats all you need. You go to match and realised the damn monster has regened its full health bar.Your screwed.. You die.10mil was a great game, It was tough, but with a but of skill and a couple of attempts, you could move forward. This sadly, has a lot more going. But due to how hard it is to get anywhere in it. Its frustrating. It feels like it has been made artificially hard to make the game a grind.In this, i have had so many runs where i can;t even get past the first monster due to the crappy tule drops. And as an additional point, the tiles aren;t that particularly different, so its really hard to see if you have a match somewhere.If at any point in a run you think ""uhh, uhh there must be a match somewhere"" you are basically dead.so in conclusion, It is a great concept as 10mil was. It feels like an updated version of 10 mil. almost like you have escaped that dungeon, and now you must build a boat to escape! but trhis journey has become a lot harder, and you aren;t going to get very far very quick.I'll give it a thumbs up. But don;t expect an easy time. and prepare to get your ar$e handed to you on a plate more frequently than miley cyrus shows some skin."

There isn't really any specialization.

But You Must Build A Boat is more of a party.For those that don't know, this may  look like a ""regular"" match three game, but you can complete matches by sliding columns and rows which adds more strategy to the match three gameplay. Also, the player progress through dungeons by making matches to affect the sidescrolling adventure at the top of the gamescreen and gaining materials and gold and leveling up RPG-ish elements.  And I find it much more fun than Bejeweled.

This game is far harder than any other match 3+ type. There is no difficulty controls, only an option to do more than 1 mission at a time which makes it more or less difficult. Even if you do just 1 mission it can still be very hard. It does require some luck to get past. There are areas where you will suddenly need to get 3 in a row of a key and they give you about 2-3 seconds to see it and find it before you get dropped with a trap that will freeze you forcing a restart of the level.The game does an ok job of not making it so frustrating when you fail. If you fail a level you can instantly start it over w/o waiting for any type of loading. You also will gain gold constantly during each fail. If you fail and restart right away you will notice your gold constantly builds up so you can go get stronger to help make it easier.My only real negative is that the first several levels are very very easy and then all of a sudden after you have moved your ship about 2 times it suddenly gets about 10x more difficult. I have been stuck on this one level for a while where I keep dying within 60 seconds and feel like I am making no progress.I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun challenging games.

There are more rooms where you can spend your accumulated resources, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're *better* (gambling room anyone?). And the designers added unskippable cutscenes...to an 8-bit game...with no real story. They also added a wholly unnecessary clicker-game for most of the unlocks in the game.

This game was also the first game that I played with the core gameplay being match 3. If you haven't played 10 million but you want try this one out, don't worry, that will work very well. You Must Build A Boat is a very easy game to get into even if you have never played match 3 games before. The gameplay is very repetitive, so if you don't want to be doing the same thing for around 8 hours (this is how long it took for me to beat the game) then you should look elsewehere. But if that isn't a problem then please try this game out. It's cheap, I very much like the art style and the music is fantastic. Gameplay works very smoothly and when you hit those massive combos accidentaly it truly is the most satisfying thing in the world. Really my only problem with the game is the fact that it's very VERY addictive and also when you start the game again you can't skip the tutorial. So all in all this game is absolutely brilliant for what it is and with the price tag it has you can't go wrong."

You will have to make a row of 3 or higher to activate them. Sword and wands blocks are needed to kill enemies. Key blocks are required to open chests and doors. Shield blocks will prevent you from pushing back. Taking an X ammount of damage will break the shield and if you have been pushed all the way to the left side, your run will end. The further you are able to go in a run the more points you will receive. But the run will be alot harder too as you will eventually face against stronger enemies.There are daily challenges.New block which is destroying every crate on the screen.Crew members are able to make your run stronger as they have stats.Alot of fun and it has new effects and items.Has guide and tips about items and monsters.The game has different music compared to the first one.

Thanks to the items that take up matching space, it becomes a deadly balancing game of playing safe with your current items while hoping future encounters work in your favor (rarely do they ever thanks to enemy resistances) or risking the next abysmal sole match-3 hidden somewhere on the board.The game tries its best to cover this issue up by encouraging the player to re-run dungeons since you ""never lose"" and the game is made for ""quick matching"". Unfortunately, these are no more than excuses built into the game's bare dialogue by the developer in hopes to hide the abysmal matching system late game.10000000 is the developer's previous game. Unfortunately, the predecessor outweighs this game when it comes to consistent gameplay and entertainment.TL;DRGet 10000000 instead.

Current stats are not displayed prior to committing to an upgrade purchase, and then only briefly.Forcing me to click numerous times to ""get"" the upgrade I just purchased, or to break my loot out of a crate, is mindless busy work, and the exact opposite of fun.  (the swipe right to open a reward chest is... tolerable)The screen shake when selling loot is unnecessary and awful.The artifact that makes matches possible at the start of a run feels like a punishment, not a benefit.  More often than not, it leaves the board thin of matches.  On a related note, the Matterhorn activation is incredibly jarring; the damage hose is nice, I guess, but it disrupts whatever I was trying to do on the grid.Being a tenth of a second off on your timing invalidates whether a match is applied.

,Not Recommended,290890,33503969,Posted: 13 July,all,tsunderecracker,"You Must Build A Boat is all about random numbers and questionable game design; the kinda thing you'd usually see for free on mobile with a banner ad at the bottom.To put it bluntly, the game is frequently just not very much fun. Everything in the game is essentially up to chance. The developers even seemingly rolled the dice and went with ""indie casual"", ""pixel art"", ""match-3 puzzle"", and ""roguelike.""Beneath all the fluff, you're really only playing a strange sort of tile matching game. You watch as your hero passively runs along a path at the top of the screen, and tiles (semi)randomly appear on a playfield at the bottom. As he proceeds along the path, he encounters obstacles such as monsters, chests, and traps. Your job is to match 3+ tiles by dragging any column horizontally or vertically. Successfully matching tiles does damage to monsters, unlocks chests, casts spells, etc.The game is technically impossible to lose, though you don't always win. Each play board has a certain objective; completing that objective earns resources and access to the next level. Failure yields a consolation prize and a retry. You can opt to undertake multiple objectives at once, but each additional objective adds another difficulty handicap.  It's a little awkward, especially thanks to the mostly randomized playfield. Sometimes matches simply cannot happen.While somewhat unique, this approach makes any given playthrough totally unpredictable, especially if RNGesus is not on your side. You can curry his favor by grinding for resources with which to upgrade your tiles, making them a few percent better at a time. Keep trying, and eventually you'll get lucky. With some objectives, that's literally the ONLY way you'll get anywhere. With no negative consequences except having to try again, randomly clicking seems to yield the same (or better) results than careful concentration.Despite the title, you don't ever actually ""build a boat."" The boat just gets bigger as you progress through the game. You attract NPCs and buy crew members in a set order, though they don't do anything except add a few more percentage perks to your tile matching stats. The grinding can get tiresome if you don't actually enjoy the matching game itself, since everything else is just window dressing.The most intentionally irritating aspect of the game is the needlessly excessive cookie clicking. When you purchase an upgrade or unlock a treasure box at the end of the level, you are REQUIRED to spam the mouse button anywhere from 20~40 times to open the chest or activate the upgrade. It's super annoying, and I can't imagine WHY they thought it was a good idea."

It is a Match 3 dungeon runner with RPG elements made famous by Puzzle Quest. It uses the take on match 3 where you drag a whole row or column at a time and it continues from the other side of the play area when it gets to either end. Match 3 or more of a tile and they break, filling in from above and giving an effect based on what tiles were broken. There is also a 'dungeon' above the play area that shows your little pixel dungeon runner moving forward until they encounter either a monster or a chest.Changes from 10,000,000Gone are the locked doors from 10,000,000, but instead you will encounter little flying traps that will fly in over the top of whatever you're encountering. The trap has a tile type displayed in it which shows you what type of tile you need to break before it drops on you and also tells you what the effect will be if you don't. The traps add a bit more complexity as they force you to either deal with their effects or break them before they drop on you while still trying to deal with the monster or chest in front of you.Also changed from 10,000,000 is the items which now spawn directly on the play area and you click them to use them. This can present a problem as they are essentially dead weight until you use them, but they aren't useful in every situation. You don't want to use a damage item if you're on a chest for example. Another example is certain monsters are weak, strong, or immune to certain items, so saving them for that monster or not using them when they'd have less effect is important, but you also can't match with them so they reduce the amount of available matches on the board.I know you're also wondering, what's up with that title? Well rather than the stark dungeon rooms of 10,000,000 you are instead gradually building a large sailing ship, though you start with a basic rowboat. The ship automatically expands as you gather more NPC's to buy upgrades from and once you've gotten all the quests done in an area you sail on to the next part of the map, which is a new dungeon.Quests are essentially the same. They form the backbone of progression in the game and give rewards for doing specific tasks along the way. Some quest rewards are just gold, some are key items which give other passive bonus effects, some are new NPC's, some are captured monsters (more on that in a second). The difference from 10,000,000 is that you can select how many quests you want to have for each run. Each quest you take increases the difficulty and rewards available on that run. They also sometimes come with their own modifiers to that dungeon.As you progress through the dungeon levels, it will either add a modifier, or reroll an existing one if it already has 4. These can be things like chests with more locks, monsters with more HP or damage output, or even visiual effects like mist or darkness that covers the right half of the dungeon.The basic NPC's are there, sword upgrades, staff upgrades, shield upgrades, potion vendor eventually. The new ones are for the replaced tile types. Wood and Stone have been replaced with Muscle and Mind. Instead of using them to unlock rooms or upgrade them, you use them to unlock small passive bonus effects in the form of captured monsters or to eventually upgrade your spells. Also since XP tiles aren't around anymore there's a vendor later that sells you those static effects for other forms of currency instead. There's even an NPC much much later that will allow you to invest gold now for a random chance of gaining more gold back after you've gone a certain distance in dungeon runs (cumulative over multiple runs). Seems like an odd choice for how late you get it, but it takes some of the grinding away potentially in the late game where stuff costs a ton of gold.Overall impressionsThis is a pretty good sequel. No bugs that I saw, better options for audio and video this time, feels like a full PC game rather than a mobile port. There are a lot of lessons learned evident in the design of the systems and it feels mature in comparison to 10,000,00. I was able to get through the main game in a few longer play sessions with 1 or 2 shorter ones here and there between. It can be picked up and put down pretty easily and still feel like you're making progress. The game isn't super long if you're just playing through all the quests, which isn't a bad thing in my eyes. My playtime represents how long it took me (approximately) to beat the game for the first time. There is an option to reset and play through again with an increase in difficulty if you're looking for a challenge or some replay value. I did not unlock everything, but I didn't feel the urge to do so. That's not a knock against the game's appeal, it shows that you don't need to grind out every upgrade in order to win.If you like Puzzle-quest-like games:This one is less complex in terms of RPG elements and trades turn based for frantic clicking action. If that sounds like fun, you'll get some good enjoyment from this one.If you like Match 3 games:The RPG elements aren't too deep or complex, and the action is real time and gets a little frantic. If you can handle that, then this one is a lot of fun."

Going through the story mode will take ~7.5 hours, and around ~25 hours to get all the achievements.Pros:- Lots more to do.- Building the boat is a more obvious form of player advancement than the counter in 10000000.- Plenty of hidden extras all over the place.(Black dragon in the art gallery, for example)- You can always make a match, so failure is (almost) always your fault.Cons:- Sometimes when you find a crate, you'll have none of the tiles you need on board, so you'll be frantically matching while you slide off into oblivion.  Can get frustrating at higher levels.- Can get frustrating when random level modifiers boost enemies in unfair ways.- The UX is a bit of a step back in some ways.  The game seems to have been designed for touch, and you'll often do something and be left with an item on screen with no clue that you're supposed to just click the living crap out of it.  The busywork clicking is annoying and out-of-place with the rest of the game.- When you restart at a higher difficulty, you have to redo the tutorial.

The chest tile is no longer there either so no matching chests in the hope of getting an item that you need. Both have been replaced with tiles on sreen that can be clicked that do something such as food, shoot a fireball etc. Upgrade system and overall aesthetic is better and the variety of monsters and their strengths and weaknesses has been improved, aswell as an improvement to the upgrade system. I hate the trap mechanic. Hate. It is such a devastating negative effect for something which has very little to do with player skill.
