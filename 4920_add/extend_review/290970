,Not Recommended,290970,10077558,"Posted: 10 May, 2014",all,Pr0wn,"As city-builders run short these days, i decided to have a go at this game. When i first started it i had in mind all the older city building game i already played such as SimCity, Cities XL, the Anno series and Sierra games (Pharaon, Zeus, the Caesar series...), the last which apparently served as the main inspiration for this game.Thus, i was not surprised of the game mechanics which mainly consists of starting from scratch with three objectives that need to be filled. You then start to build some houses and production buildings, and the way to proceed is as i said above based on Sierra's mechanics: citizens need a certain resource/building in order to upgrade their houses, and therefore increase the rent income. Run short of any resource and the houses will shortly degrade to the highest level it can attain with the remaining ones.Production on it's side consists of running a production chain which may consist of one up to three buildings in order to well... produce resources. These resources can be either used to satisfy citizen's needs, be sold at trading routes or given to the few events (up to three per mission from my experience). Some other elements have been included such as crime or fire, with respectively the sheriff and fire brigade in order to fight against them.At this stage of the review you are probably thinking ""Well that doesn't look so bad, does it?"". And unfortunately it does. Let me explain you why, in the same way as i described the game above:You start each game with three objectives: there is absolutely no time-limit or constraint of any kind. There is no other way to lose the game then through bad management, which is nearly impossible after a playing for a few hours. You can start from three ""difficulty"" options at the start of each mission, but it does only impact the first few minutes of play.The resource management of this game is very simplistic: The raw resources are produced at a steady rate, never influenced by seasons (grapes, grain and cotton all the year! ) nor resource availability (hunters producing without animals, lumber mills without forests...). Stock management has been dealt with by giving your warehouse an unlimited storage capacity. You cannot predict as well the resource supply and demand of your city easily, as no production and consumption summary is given, which means that you will have to over-produce all goods required to avoid stock shortage.Trade is the simplest form that could be included. You pay a ""fee"" to open the trade route with a city, and then after you can import or export goods from there. Goods are imported/exported at a fixed price, with unlimited quantity. This means that you can sell the town next door 100k logs of lumber at the same price, and import 100k crates of beer, without any impact on future trade or product price. Production capacity and demand are simply not taken into account in this game. This lead to a ""give me money"" button that can be pressed once in a while, without thinking any further.Wages and rents are also fixed, population satisfaction is simply not taken into account, and unemployment's only impact is the color of the total population indicator. Hazards like crime and fire are solved by having the relevant building, effectively leading the risk to 0%. Other natural hazards likely never happen, or even if they do their impact is so minor that you do not even need to take them into account.One back side of this game simplicity is that a resource shortage (non-anticipable as said before) can lead to total mayhem. A  house degrading can mean worker shortage (which has no proper indicator), and this shortage can escalate to a complete desertion: some buildings required by citizens are shut down, leading to further house degrading, leading to further work shortage... A simple feature to give work priorities could eliminate this issue but it has not been implemented.To sum up, this game is simplistic, terribly easy, and becomes quickly repetitive. I can say without any risk that after playing this game for 2 hours like i did you will have gotten all that this game has to offer. The only difficulties that can arise are not part of the intended gameplay but are the result of a lack of management tools and features that are included in most other city-builders.Despite having the full california on the main menu and a large map when starting a game, you are confined in a tiny square without any opportunity to expand. That shocked me first but after playing for a while you understand that this space is all you need to have a working untouchable, steady producing money-farm.To finish this review i wanted to say that i understand that this a new indie development studio, but i just took a look of the game description of this store page. ""complex cities"" and ""deep simulation games"" are not the words i would use to describe this game. On this opposite i would use the words ""simplistic"" and ""casual"". This is typically a game you could run on social networks or mobile phones, but in no way a city-builder simulation or resource management game.Recommendation:- For new players discovering the genre: This game could be an interesting first city-builder to play, but you will soon outgrow this game and regret buying it in the first place. If you want to start with a city-building game you should look for classics such as the ones i listed in the first pagagraph.- For experimented city-building games players: Do not buy this game as you will feel robbed after playing for a few hours. Used to more complex management games it will feel like riding a car on a carousel after being used to drive a real one.Sorry for the long review, but i didn't want to freely throw a bunch of critics without explaining why i came to these conclusions."

However, it is time consuming. The majority of the time you've built the required number of buildings and you're waiting for them to accumulate the needed number of supplies to move onto the next section of California to colonize. The plot of land you're given is relatively tiny, given how much you can really move around.Each game I was given an ""edge"" from completing a previous round. There was no right or wrong answer to what helps you, just whatever helps you in how you finish the objectives in the time alotted. This, I found helpful. It benefitted my playing style which is very kind because I have a certain way I like to set up my time management games. It also allowed me to experiment each level.What drove me relatively bonkers was that nothing really changed from level to level. Usually there's something new introduced that makes a very significant impact, but this never happened in my course of playing. I had to use multiple important buildings because the reach was impossibly short and your town/settlement will go to hell in a moment's notice and you will not salvage it unless you can accomplish a few key things in the first few moments of establishing your settlement.But once you figure out your pattern of play, you generally just sit there, wait for your settlers to upgrade their houses, and just keep refueling things.It's perhaps the worst city building sim I've played and I was highly disappointed. Wasn't worth the price I paid. I've honestly just sat still most of the time and done absolutely nothing. It's also a bit dated-looking as well so there are prettier games out there for your money.Maybe this could be a game to teach small children about areas of California during the Gold Rush, but I don't believe this could keep their attention too long. This likely plays better on a tablet or a phone, as well. Personally, I'm not a fan and even after forcing myself to give it a good go, it wasn't meant to be."

Build a simple western town from a single isometric perspective. No pesky angles and rotation to get in your way. It turns out 1849 is anything but relaxing.In 1849, you are tasked with building a city to support trade, commerce and the oncoming onslaught of tourists ready to strike it rich and find some gold.Look, I thought this game looked fun, a nice distraction. But to be brutally honest, its bad. Its unbalanced, its tedious, its unfair.. for no reason. I started in on the campaign a bit hoping to get a grasp of things, sure enough I did. I figured it was more directed in during that type of mode so it was a bit tougher on you but it turns out that even in free-play its awful.I will attempt to explain, there is an economy of resources that your city can make and export or import with money you've earned through selling your products. The thing is you must first establish a trade route, so far so good, however there is no way to make trade routes for anything other than what 4 other cities want. As in the seed you generate at the starting of your map, should it not have lumber per se, you are completely left out in the dust. There is no way to make lumber and therefore no way for your city to expand.You need to collect rent from houses, you need to create jobs for the residents of those houses, However the cost of running the businesses to employ them is generally higher the the amount of rent you get from low income housing. So, what do you do to keep your city afloat? The short answer is sell any and all goods not needed for your people to whoever and anyone that will by it. You'll need food obviously, you'll need lumber for houses and expansion, and you'll need some variety of alcohol to satiate the peoples boredom.And because production and running costs are at a premium you'll need to import something most likely being lumber. Which in my experience costs three times as much as anything I was exporting such as shoes made from animal hides and brandy made from grapes. Without selling the goods I was losing money on production costs and even after I sold them any disasters like earthquakes or random fires and rampant crime do to unemployment  made my cost of importing lumber even higher. Bringing me and my city down further and further. A cycle I could not break and in fact saw fit to make me bankrupt.I should mention that even though this is a city builder; it makes no attempt at any point to become automated. As in every time I needed to sell my exports I had to do it manually making it even more tedious. It's come to my attention this is also a mobile game and I have nothing inherently against those however I do know they are in general designed to be played in very short stints which this game does indeed evoke that sentiment maybe TOO quickly. It doesn't seem very in depth but its not shallow. Its just not worth your time, money or effort.THE GISTAll in all, I just can't recommend this game to anyone.. for any reason. Play Cities: Skylines. I honestly thought the throwback to static isometric camera angle would make things a bit easier to grasp but the game seems so tilted towards your destruction its just not fun on any level. No.. just say no.Follow my curation for more"
,Not Recommended,290970,14604691,"Posted: 22 February, 2015",all,firewriter,"I spent a snowy weekend playing this game and I doubt I'll play it much more (if ever again.) In general, I am a huge fan of city builders and after reading the mostly positve reviews I was psyched to give this a try. It is probably one of the most limited and frustrating games I've ever played.The type of resources you can create/gather/mine/farm are pre-selected from the beginning and sometimes make no sense. I hda one game where I needed to export stone bricks, but couldn't build a stone quarry. so I would have to buy stones, then turn them into stone bricks, then export them for less than the cost of the original stone.Also, you can't tell the quanities of anything (this is a pet peeve of mine in city builders.) How many vinyards do I need to make how much wine, how much wheat makes how much bread (and how much bread is needed per citizen?)You can't unlock new trade routes. You can't unlock new buildings. Sometimes getting off the ground is incredibly difficult, other times, building a massive city, that can quickly become unweildy because for instance, the lumber cycle, lumber -> boards -> furniture, is extremely slow, so you may for instance, run out of room to put lumber yards.Anyway, overall, disappointed. Graphics were cute but you can't do anything more than zoom. You can't rotate the view or objects. If you're looking for an afternoon time waster, maybe try this. Otherwise, go check out Tropico 4."

,Not Recommended,290970,30077540,Posted: 21 February,all,furrykef,"This is the worst simulation I have ever played. It is literally more profitable to leave your citizens unemployed than to put them to work producing goods to sell. The only reasons to employ them at all are because too much unemployment causes crime and because you have to meet the completely arbitrary goals of the scenario. For example, there is a scenario where you're supposed to make and sell pickaxes, but according to my calculations, you actually take a net loss of over $12 per pickaxe! Is it too much to ask that the developers of an economic simulation do a little basic math?"

Do you like simple options with easy level up abilities where you don't have to relay on a bible? This is the game for you! Don't be fooled if you're failing the first few story attempts.

If you are looking for an easy building game that can pass some time then look no further. I personally enjoy this game, even though some things can be quite annoying like; not being able to move buildings once placed or rotate them, buildings that are half in and half out of fire department lines still burn down, being robbed even with a sherrif building with the zone, building degrading back to shack and plenty more but I won't write a book... The difficulty does increase the further you travel, so a good strategy is needed.All in all for the full price tag on this, I wouldn't recommend, but if you enjoy city building, regardless of the graphics and management system, then I would recommend grabbing this at a discounted price."

76561198246234164,Not Recommended,290970,35034326,Posted: 17 September,all,IL PALLINO,"Overview:1849 is a settlement management sim set in...  Well?  In the time of the California Gold Rush.  1849 can be played in both sandbox and campaign modes, with the latter involving building towns all around California to exploit natural resourses of the immediate area, and sell these resourses to other cities in California via trade routes. Once scenario objectives are complete, it's time to move onto the founding of the next city.  Trade routes are both ways, so if one city buys something your city has to offer, then you'll also be able to buy whatever it is that other city specializes in, and hopefully the item in question will be something your settlement needs.  But like many other management sims, it's much better to sell than it is to buy.Graphics and sound:The graphics are what you can expect for the money, but that ASSumes the player bought 1849 when it was on sale.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137777463There's nothing that stands out as particularly likable concerning the sounds of the game, but the period music does help with setting the mood.  I'll listen to the music if I really do need a mood-setter, but I don't particularly enjoy any song in the game's soundtrack more than the other, so I'll mute the sound on the game, and play my own brand of music the few times I play 1849.Positives:1849 is an original concept for management sims, and there's not a great deal of gold rush era games in the first place.  If you're fascinated by the Gold Rush era, you should enjoy this game more than me if you management sims are your thing.Negatives:The difficulty curve in 1849 appears to have some randomness to it.  (Either that, or it gets extremely difficult very quickly!)  The first several missions in 1849 were pig simple, but fairly early on, you're still going to need to need playthrough videos or text walkthroughs to help beat one of the scenarios.  The way to complete one early scenario was one I never would have guessed on account of the scenario not requiring production or selling of the biggest money maker, which is your only means of completing this scenario.  Any management sim fan will tell you that there's nothing worse than a game that has only one exact way of completing a scenario, and while I can tolerate such a flaw in missions that are supposed to be extremely difficult at the end of a campaign, a player shouldn't have to go through it less than five scenarios into the game.There's nothing interesting to speak of about the campaign.  There's no main character to speak of, nothing of interest comes up between scenarios except for a big ol' map of northern California, and the location of where you settle next.  In fact, the campaign just seems very boring in general.  It's been about twenty years since Railroad Tycoon 2 was released, and it featured very interesting insights to scenarios.  (Including it's expansion pack, which had interesting things to say about even it's far future scenarios.)Remember Imperium Romanum which had all sorts of interesting facts about the Roman Empire that were revealed as you played the game?  This feature is totally absent from 1849.  My only interest in California may be in the Punk bands from there, but it would have been nice to have gotten lessons from the game as to the relevance of things like olive oil and cotton to the Californian economy when you're pretty sure that gold mining was the be all, end all of what made settlers want to settle in a state plagued by mudslides, earthquakes, fires, and lots of people who think the sun shines out of their behinds.  Random fun facts about the Gold Rush would have been nice, but about the only thing you're going to learn from this game, is that the campaign can be difficult, and is really uninteresting.  (Players may, however, have fun building up a city in a sandbox game.)Conclusion:Listen to your friends on Steam:  They are your friends for a reason, and they mean what they say when they say not to purchase a game!  I thought one friend in particular was just being overly critical about 1849 (and lacking in key information), but you can take it from me to save your money on much more fascinating games, because I make a more solid effort to inform players (usually friends) about games.  I do intend on completing the campaign someday just for the sake of having bought this game. (Edit:  I changed my mind, and decided to request a refund.)  You might have fun playing sandbox games just for the sake of building settlements from the ground on up.  (A challenge I sometimes enjoy, but far less after having played Banished.)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137776534I cannot recommend 1849 in good faith to anyone.  There's far better games on Steam involving management for the same amount of money (even at 1849's sale price), and if you need the challenge of developing cities, just look for an established city building game to get your kicks."

It was super fun trying to figure out the best balance of things and also which starting opportunity to pick for each.Again, my only lament is there are not enough scenarios to play through even with the DLC.

This game was well worth my investment given that I'm a fan of strategy/city builder games. The challenge is to find the sweet spot between population growth and building new structures which generates various goods. A few of these goods can then be sold via the market (providing you have paid to open a trade route), and this - along with rent - are the two mechanisms which allow you to earn money in order to buy needed supplies (again, via the market and trade routes), and grow your community.Each map limits you in a different way. Some, you won't be able to create your own lumber so you'll have to buy that from the market. Others, you may have to purchase food, etc. The key is to determine early on what you can produce and sell in abundance to generate cash. Ironically, about the worst thing you try to produce is gold or silver because the pace at which these commodities are produced is far too slow to generate much of an income. I think this is an area that could be better balanced.The building/trade/town growth are fun to establish and nurture along, and each map presents its own unique challenges throughout the campaign. Occasional bonus goals also come along which usually offer nice rewards if you can complete them - though they sometimes lead your original plan off course which can be both fun and frustrating. The down side, for me, was the interface. Not horrible, but there was no mechanism to set a ""sell when this item exceeds 100 units"" or ""buy when this item falls below 50 units"" kind of thing, which would negate the repetitive opening and closing of the trade window. Also, when you purchase items from the trade window, they show up immediately despite the fact that the horse and buggy representing the delivery of these items doesn't hit your trade depot for several seconds. This also happens with lines of production, where the worker icons seem to just be there for show as there is no delay from producing an item do delivery. But for a relatively casual game, this is a fairly solid purchase if you like time management and city building games. Overall, I give this game 7/10."

76561198032804619,Recommended,290970,22711422,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,kebzero,"1849 is a straightforward and simple little city builder set to the California gold rush era. The maps are quite small, however, so your ability to actually build is limited more by space than any other resource. The challenges put forward at each map tend to be either remarkably easy, or frustratingly difficult (unless you're replaying the map after learning what the scripted 'surprises' for that particular map is).I'd hesitate in calling this game 'deep' by any measure, and as a city builder/sim it is below par compared to titles two decades its senior - but at its price point it is decent value for your money; good enough for a short pass-time game, though you'll likely not return to it after you've beaten it once. 1849 also gets credit for a soothing (if repetitive) musical score, and for being reasonably easy to get 100% steam achievements with. Altogether, that's what makes me give this a thumbs up rather than down.If you consider buying this game, I recommend getting its Nevada DLC as well; it introduces more maps with the added complexity of railroad cars over coaches for your trading game, meaning a fair bit more planning ahead than the base game requires. If they're bundled on sale, they're worth picking up for a few evenings of 19th century city building."

,Recommended,290970,33868743,Posted: 28 July,all,ephy,"1849 is a gold rush-themed city builder in the same vein as the classic Impressions series (Pharaoh, Caesar, Zeus, and Emperor). It's a little less complex than the aforementioned games, and the strategy is pretty much the same for each level, making it a little repetitive after a while. Still, it's a long game (20 hours in, and I still haven't finished it), and it's certainly worth picking up on sale.The UI has some flaws; first of all, it covers up too much of the playing field. There are only two 'advisors': population and economy. The economics advisor doesn't give you nearly enough information about where your money is going. When buying and selling goods, you cannot set a purchase/sell level, where anything below/above that number is bought/sold. If you run out of a resource needed for your houses, they will devolve; thus, you must keep an eye on how much stock you have in your warehouse. You can tag items in the warehouse to 'hoard', but only food and alcohol, not resources such as wood and fabric.As someone pointed out in an earlier review, when you start the game, you're likely to think, 'Wow! This is such a small map.' However, you really don't need much space to fulfill the terms of the missions. In addition, buildings can neither be rotated nor moved once placed. They can, however, be deactivated to save money. Also, there is no indication of this in game, butmines do eventually run out of resources.Pros:+ charming graphics.+ multiple 'difficulty' levels (starting resources per level).+ simple, straightforward gameplay.+ sound effects and music are appropriate.+ achievements.+ trading cards.Cons:- the UI is too big for the screen.- not enough detail about commerce.- trading cannot set continuous limits to buy/sell.- buildings half in/half out of firehall zone will burn down.Meh:~ strategy is basically the same for each level.~ gameplay can be repetitive and shallow.~ too simple for hardcore city builder aficionados.Ephy Rating: 6/10Summary: This would be a decent 'My First City Builder' game, assuming it's purchased on sale. Alternatively, if you're looking for a 'city builder lite', this is also an adequate choice. Personally, I enjoyed being able to use a similar strategy for most levels, but YMMV. If you want a more complex city builder, try Civ Rome, Children of the Nile, or Banished (in that order of difficulty/challenge)."

Easy to understand with simple game play idea but is still very fun. It gets more complicated each level and mixes it up by each level being a different city with different buildings to use. My major fault in it is that the buildings do not rotate therefore your city may look kinda funny but is totally functional. I would recomend to anyone who like fun city building games that actually have a campaign, not just free play. Great game."

The main story only takes about 15 hours to complete, but the game has good replay value if you're the type of gamer that likes to go back into beaten levels to try to complete tasks you couldn't before or try again with more challenging starter resources. The sandbox mode allows for further messing around too, but I can't figure out how to save a custom town before proceeding to a new one.It features some nice isometric artwork and a solid soundtrack that doesn't loop too quickly (although, the sound effects do sometimes get repetetive).I agree with other players on the point that it would be nice to have a feature that automates trading at a pace that you could customize, since micro-managing trades for resources that you need a constant supply of can become REALLY tedious. The Nevada DLC features a railroad trading system that automates trades, but the quantity traded cannot be customized, so it actually limits the size to which you can grow your town/city."

The expansions paying tribute to the Nevada silver rush and the post-gold rush era make an excellent addition to the 1849-driven story. The core gameplay mechanic is basically just balancing population, who pays rent, with workplaces, which cost upkeep but keep people from committing crimes. It's not a terribly deep game and the maps are pretty basic, but each level in story mode differs in objective and modifiers and presents you a few interesting choices as to how you're going to play. It spends a good deal of time on non-mining economics as well: after all, it was the vintners, builders and saloon owners who truly made their fortune on the gold rush."

It's more of a puzzle game than any sort of real city building game.On the other hand if you enjoy this sort of puzzle game (i.e. what do I need to build to make houses grow up further AND as if not more importantly, in what order) then maybe you'd enjoy this.I can't however recommend this to any hardcore city building fan.  It took me all of 5 minutes to determine that so take it with a grain of salt.I thought it might be a lot more fun than it ultimately turned out for me.  Once you know the formula to grow your houses, then it's a simple matter of choosing what ""city"" on the map you want to play, then check the random list of items (once you start the city) of items you can buy and sell and then you know what to concentrate your efforts on to make money.  Some buildings end up costing you money (such as gold or silver mines) where as others like a house you'd collect rent from and make money.In the real world it makes no sense that your gold mine is not producing oodles of cash.  I believe the developers decided to try to balance things this way and it's just sort of strange for city building fans.However, the worst offense in this game would be the lack of management information.  Due to that a lot of things are left up to simply overproducing resources to avoid shortages and personally I don't find that fun.  I enjoy number crunching and this game doesn't leave me much room at all for that.Sorry, but it's a pass for me."

I love city builders but was looking for some a little more simple than a huge sim-city type deal and without the combat that other strategy games have. I never get bored with the diverse scenarios each map brings and the acheivements you can obtain.I have had no major gameplay issues, and have no serious complaints. As far as suggestions may go, I was hoping for a little more financial control, rather than really just balancing the wage-rent ratio. It gets a little annoying having to manually go in and sell my products every 10 seconds, whereas it would seem like a nice addition to offer contracts to the other cities in the same way you sometimes get from completeing commissions- every month a certain number of resources is sent over automatically.Also, the population(?) advisor lady gets on my nerves, it seems like people in every city want to expand insanely quicker than your set up or ready to handle regardless of the scenario. Obviously people in a vineyard paradise are going to demand nice things, but in small mining town scenarios people begin to demand luxuries that are not availiable for that map (cobbler, tailor, etc) and end up throwing a hissy fit and leaving. That sort of control of expansion and growth seems  like it would be nice to have as the mayor. It seems unrealistic that during this time period a small mining outpost would attract the rich, family-type crowd.On the opposite end of the spectrum I have had issues with houses refusing the expand even though the conditions are met, but I have no idea if that is part of the game considering they were the first few houses I built and subsequent houses did expand quickly.And one tiny thing that just upsets my OCD personality, is that you cannot rotate buildings. In my opinion, its the simple details that sets a game apart from a city-builder farming phone game. Even from the screen shots you see building stacked in clusters behind and infront of each other. This is a game that can boast time-period accuracy, but the concept of anyone, anytime moving into town and opening up a shoestore that directly blocks your front porch seems unlikely. It's purely an aesthetic annoyance, but seemed worth a mention.Overall though, seriously I love this game. And it takes some serious willpower to walk away even for a second."

May be on par with the great names of Sierra. Some issues needs to be looked on. The main issue is that, when something burn, you are not notified and you have to guess what building it was. After 1400 pop the game is getting filled with lag and glitches but nothing game-changing. I need even bigger maps."
