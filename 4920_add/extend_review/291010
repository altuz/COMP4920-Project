,Recommended,291010,14537217,"Posted: 18 February, 2015",all,RAIZO,"Prepare to die screaming…or more likely laughing at the horrendously bad voice acting of ‘The Hat Man: The 20+ Pages’……wait….wrong game (and more on the voice acting later).Alas, just as has happened with so many other indie horror games in recent years and with the advent of the Slender series, ‘The Hat Man:  Shadow Ward’ (the ‘for real’ name) falls victim to the same ‘collect quest’ gameplay  mechanic.  This means that you need to find a set number of pages from your daughter’s diary to complete the game.  Ultimately, that’s the basis of the game:  you either play as the father or mother in search of said daughter, who has gone missing from the seemingly empty asylum she was committed to which is now populated by shadow people/The Hat Man (BTW – the idea of shadow peeps is based loosely on fact and there are many documented cases, and even some decent movies, about people that have seen or had encounters with these so-called ‘Shadow People’).  Thankfully, you don’t just search for pages as you also need to find some other items to progress deeper into the asylum and defeat The Hat Man (who I guess is like the pimp of the shadow peeps) to get your daughter back.One of the more unique attributes of this game (though it’s been done before) is that sound is utilized to pinpoint the location of pages/other items you need by means of whispery voices.  Also, the sound design of this game isn’t half bad for being a budget title, with some of the sound effects/ambient music being pretty creepy in my opinion.Now as promised, I must go back to my earlier comment about the voice acting.  Granted, this game is super short and can be beat in less than half an hour, so you may think that voice acting wouldn’t be too important in such a game…..but it kinda, sorta totally is.  Essentially, it’s hilarious.  No, seriously, I’m not joking.  I mean, it’s so stupendously bad that it’s good (I don’t know how that works; it defies the human intellect to comprehend how that can be) but it’s true.  I figure most people will laugh at it, though some may actually want to cry at how bad it is.  And for all those 100% achievement unlock Steamers out there – prepare thine selves!!  There is actually an achievement for listening to your daughter reading the pages of her diary as you collect them.  Sure, this game can fairly easily be ‘100%’d’ and the aforementioned achievement is easy enough to unlock, but don’t go joy-puking your faces off just yet as I seriously believe that listening to all of the pages may very well land you in an asylum. I personally just barely managed to keep my sanity intact while unlocking this achievement, so don’t say I didn’t warn you.This game can be fun for like 2 hrs tops, but I wouldn’t recommend it at full price, even if it is a budget title. With decent voice acting, who knows, perhaps this game could have been terrifying.  As it is, it will likely be overlooked by most gamers, but it is somewhat interesting and good for a laugh….or cry, so give it a shot."
,Not Recommended,291010,22438959,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,[J7] Dsp21 👻,"“The Scariest Game of 2014”?I know these marketing techniques and they usually don't influence me, but I still went ahead and bought this game for like 25 cents because, why not? One can argue that for the price any game is worth it, except The Slaughtering Grounds, but actually there's games that are pretty much similar or even better and they don't ask for a penny. With all due respect to the developers, this game is an attempt at being something and I can see it, but fails due to the large amount of bugs and many other problems. I'm really nit-picky so I will address a lot of things in this review that most people maybe don't have a problem with.When booting the game, I recognize the Unity launcher right away. Me and Unity games usually don't go well, but I can't judge a game by it's launcher obviously... Then the game boots up and a crazy amount of FPS makes me almost certain I'm going to have tearing issues, so I check Settings, only to find out that there's no option for VSync. I thought this was a standard in game options by now! Key bindings are pretty simple and I did try to change the inventory up and down bindings to my mouse wheel and it doesn't work so I'll just stick to the T and G keys, I had never done that, and it's terrible.Finally I choose Play, and I pick to play as the Father. Upon the first second of the game... there it is, the damn screen tearing all over the place. Quite hard to ignore but since most of the game is dark as hell, I give it a pass. So, I go upstairs, touch a book and the game has officially started. So the first complaint is, although I know a lot of people just skip it nowadays but, tutorials please. I had no idea what I should be doing and how should I progress, you can't expect me to rely on the internet to find out how to escape or kill a damn ghost that just clips through the wall and grabs you in the first SECONDS. Turns out I just needed to Zoom my lantern in her face and she dies.Then it seems I have to pickup... pages? Wait isn't this like that game where you're in the woods and... yes it is. You're pretty much lying if you say this game isn't a copy of Slender: The Eight Pages inside 4 walls because it clearly is. What it does differently is the fact that this is randomly generated, and it works well for the most part. You go right pass 3 rooms, and if you go back the map has changed. This is actually very interesting and an idea that I found to be wasted on a game like this.So you do get the book and those pages, and finally enter this sort of asylum, this is where you seek the pages that your daughter wrote, as this is some sort of dream that you got to save her from. Upon collecting the fifth page, when the little 5 green balls are lit now on my HUD (which I had no idea what they were for like 2 hours), the almighty, spooky and fearsome enemy spawns. One of the main flaws in this game is the so called ""Hat man"", because he's just laughable, he just floats and follows you trying to catch you. Which he will never do since you can outrun him easily. Then he despawns somehow. This is the whole game, or pretty much all of it. Then again I do say, the lack of tutorials make this game so much harder than it is, no one actually gives you any tips on how to evade the Hatman or even progress in the game. The journal pages do give you tips but I don't feel it's enough for the player to actually understand what he has to do. Just to clarify, the little orbs in the HUD indicate that a new item to progress in the game has spawned and is now placed in the random rooms, so you need to find 5 pages for each new item to progress in the game.Another complaint I have is, sound effects. You might ask, what sound effects? Exactly, there's barely any. When I die, playing as the father by the way, the sound of me getting caught is of a woman, what the hell. Also, the Hatman himself hardly makes any kind of noise, he doesn't even make a sound when he catches you...The Hatman spawns are literally the only thing in this game that makes it hard and infuriating to say the least. And when you get cornered there's no way to go, making it such a cheap way to make you lose. Since there's a lack of manual saving, you're only allowed to save if you find certain save points, but these are hard to come by and you will lose a lot of progress. Also, the worst thing is when you've made good progress and the Hatman literally just clips through the damn floor and kills you. That made me rage-quit this game so badly I actually was about to give up on this, but I still got to the ending because I like self-torture, and achievements.The atmosphere is... good! Despite the game being flawed to hell, having a not-creepy-at-all enemy that's just annoying and the lack of sound effects, the atmosphere does feel tense, and the feeling of not knowing where you should go because the game is randomly generated does give it a feeling of anxiety, since you never know what's on the next room, it could be the spooky scarecrow or the next exit. But please take note, a scary game doesn't need to have the brightness of the ocean depths. Don't rely so much in darkness to make your game scary. I hate games that are way too dark. I know horror has to be dark, but I like playing a game, not just hearing it.As for my final thoughts... The Hat Man: Shadow Ward, is it worth your time? Sorry, it isn't. With this formula there's so many more like this, and they're probably better executed, probably free too. I always wonder if developers read these reviews and reading what I just wrote would leave me heartbroken, but I have to be honest, Hat man is a poor game and I cannot recommend it. 2/10"

But it so nicely summed up the game for me that I couldn’t help but appreciate that I was being handed a focus point for my review without even having to look for it.But let’s step back for a moment because it’s not just the death screen important here, but how you arrive at it. After scurrying through a twisting, self replicating maze of stock textures and out of place items, you’re inevitably caught the titular Hat Man in all his floating jack-o-lantern glory. And what’s this? He’s opening his mouth and- oh, I guess that wasn’t supposed to happen.And just like that we’re transported to a perfectly flat, perfectly bland death screen featuring three buttons, each drawn with the same ugly font and taking up almost the entire screen. I realize it’s a screen that didn’t need to have much detail, but what’s here is such a pitiful excuse for a menu I couldn’t help but laugh at it.I suppose I can give The Hat Man that much anyway; it made me laugh. First at the ridiculous voice acting that I want so much to believe was intentional. Then when turning around and laying eyes on what I think was supposed to be a terrifying demon but looked more like a blazing smile.And finally at the death screen, which I saw many times and eventually decided was a good enough place to give this game a rest. After all The Hat Man is just doing his job haunting this asylum, and doing it damn well at that, so I’ll just leave him be and go do literally anything else to try to forget this ever happened.You can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

I feel like a 4.99 price tag would be more appropriate.The voice acting is painful. I'm pretty forgiving of things like this, but wow. It actually made the game less scary because some of the comments were very out of place and sarcastic. When you're doing a horror game, the feeling needs to be raw with genuine fear. How are we supposed to be afraid if you aren't?I don't feel like I have enough time to sit and listen to the journal entries. Whenever I try to listen to or read one so I can learn about the story, hatman comes and kills me. I don't know if this is a glitch or normal, but I can't learn about the story if I get killed every time I'm reading the journal. I really wanna know what's going on with the lady's daughter but I still haven't much of a clue as to what's going on in the asylum.Here is what I liked:Running around collecting pages/piecing together a story.Some folks feel like it's too bright, but I disagree. You can't have shadows without light.When the bad voice acting wasn't ruining my immersion, I was actually scared of the hatman and rushing through the asylum trying to find everything without dying. Though I wish he was a little less agressive so that I could have more time to explore and see the rooms/read journals.So with all of this being said, I'm still trying to complete the game. These are just my opinions for right now and may likely change."

Thought Process,"A solid, low-budget first-person survival horror closely linked toSlenderman: The Eight Pages, housing a fair amount of haunting images and thick atmosphere, evoking a handful of steady cold shivers and durable tension within its short run, mostly due to the eerie and restrained sound design.Your daughter has gone missing from the asylum where she was being treated for attempting suicide. Once you enter the vacant facility, investigating her whereabouts, you begin looking for pages from your daughter's journal while being hunted by a dark presence wearing a hat.The basic gameplay of finding a bunch of objects to unlock new areas for further exploration is quite easily comprehensible, yet it may be a fair disorienting challenge to obtain all 20+ pages since the randomly altering level design relocate the pages on each playthrough; though once you pinpoint the location of a page, whispery voices are in effect and narrowing it down become child's play.The stiff level design is utterly mediocre at best and visually it is quite dull, but the ridiculously awkward voice-over is the shattering winner to listen to and hence should have been left out. Also, the poorly written dialogue comes out far more silly rather than intriguing, and finally - considering the source material that is based on real events - the outcome turns out quite immaterial.At a discount however, coupled with appreciating solid scares, Game Mechanics' short piece of indie horror, regardless of being a Slender copy, earns a night's attention.5,5 / 10"
,Recommended,291010,23358630,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,♥ Gia ♥,"This game starts with a somewhat interesting concept. You can choose between a mother and a father, which so far, the only difference that it makes is that your death scream is different. You're trapped in some kind of demonic ward, or should I say, a shadow ward? This ward is always changing, so you have to keep moving forwards all the time. You gotta collect pages, too, like in Slenderman games, but way more, and a few other items along the way like matches and levers. You pretty much run between corridors, and now and then, you'll hear some kind of whispering, telling you that there is an item in a side room. If you miss an item and leave the room, just keep running, there is no point in going back, it probably changed already.The main enemy of this game, is the Hat Man, a being that from a distance kinda looks like a trenchcoat wearing guy with a hat, surrounded in a cloud of blackness and with a purple aura. Later on, he changes to something different, that's way faster and more persistent, adding a bit of fear to the mix.That being said, the problem with these procedually generated games is that, sometimes, it's way too random. And in this game's case, sometimes you're going to be able to finish the game in less than 30 minutes, sometimes it's going to take way longer than that. It took me around 30 minutes for a room I needed to spawn. I even believed my game was bugged.The game's atmosphere is kinda creepy at first, being chased by this creature that never stops. (Actually, he does, when you enter a certain kind of room, like stairs or the room with the pit)It's got some weak jumpscares, too, like a ceiling light falling, or a wheelchair moving. The problem is, after running from the Hat Man for a while, and after seeing the same rooms and the same jumpscares over and over again over the period of....dozens of minutes....It kinda starts to get old rather fast. It's quite a short game, and it doesn't offer much. It's really, really cheap, too. So, all in all, it feels stale, and it gets old rather fast, but I did find it fun for a short while. Maybe playing lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games myself kinda made me more tolerant to this kind of stuff, but, If it's on sale, why not? You could try it for yourself."

Mostly get things to happen in the right order, with the player looking in the right place at the right time... without forcing them to.As with Daylight, the results are mixed. Mind you I am not aware of any game which has pulled that off without issues.A fun ride, if a bit short... which is good otherwise you'd become used to it.Don't look too hard at it and just enjoy the playthrough.

Not only are the graphics absolute trash, but the whole game seems to revolve around collecting the remaining two pages in the rooms and finding items. Finding the items is an absolute nightmare and I only managed to find the crowbar, matches and a spike pit featured in the trailer video, all in one hour. That is literally how long it takes sometimes due to poor game design and repetitive room layouts. The room layout is so repetitive you easily lose your way and have difficulty even telling where you are, it's essentially a walking, searching and escaping simulator all mashed up into one. Not to mention the AI for the Hat Man is atrocious, since all it does is ""teleport"" to a location directly in your field of view, namely in front of you. He goes through walls and can't be shaken off, as he'll just ""teleport"" directly in front of you again when you have all five pages of the journal. He looks like some image taken from google and plastered onto a model and called the oh-so-scary Hat Man.As for the Shadow people, I never even encountered any of them. The only thing I'd seen that would even possibly be close to that was at the beginning when you click on the journal and a creature shows up to steal your soul, but I think even then that's just the Hat Man. It's a bit like Dead by Daylight, Slender: The Eight Pages and Vanish all combined to make this pathetic excuse for a game. You walk away and instantly the rooms have changed, making it impossible to find your way back. Some hints or even an explanation of what to do would be nice so I'm not aimlessly wandering around halls, running from the dreaded Hat Man, who's kill animation makes me want to throw up.Shockingly enough, the audio and atmosphere in the game was tolerable. Audio would get extremely repetitive, but the occasional radio playing badly done music was fairly creepy. Also a falling tile or light, whatever it was, was a good trick, but the novelty wears off really quick and you grow to expect it. Same for the mysteriously moving wheelchairs, although those can get you caught if you're unlucky (Or daft).So overall, this game isn't really something you should buy, especially at full price. If you're really that desperate to try it, wait until it goes on sale, that way you won't be as disapointed. I'm disgusted people say it's a quality game and recommend it, as a troll or not, because this is worse than Rob Zombie's '31'. And that movie was terrible. Really, if you want a quality game that still has the room changing mechanic, install Vanish on GameJolt, it's good and free."

,Recommended,291010,22762400,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,Its_Oli | UK,"The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a must-have for gamers who love horror. I feel positively about most aspects of this game. First of all, the price. This game is very affordable at the price of £0.79, although I picked this up in a sale (£0.19!), and it is worth it! I feel this game is quite underappreciated for what it is. The plot of the game itself is interesting, but yet not very unique. A mental asylum is quite common to see in horror games, however, copying ideas can result in a better game overall (the way I feel about this game). In no way at all will I compare this game with other horror survival games such as Outlast or Alien: Isolation, but it must be said, this game is genuinely scary, what you'd look for in a horror game.I feel the way this game's layout is set is great, for example, the beginning of this game has a few doors that I myself thought you'd be able to open, but cannot. This can result in disliking the game or liking it even more. For me, this tactic doesnt mean the map is too detailed, and I like that. Many times I've played games that have had too many places to go to, when in the end, all I had to do was go through the main door. Adding details like doors that canot be opened helps prevent wasting time, which is great, getting to the next point of the story without wasting time or lowering suspense.Like I covered previously, the main obvious plot is not too unique, which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all! Having a man chase you through a mental asylum is, of course, going to be a common theme. (Please note, the actual story to this game is rather unique, and the fact it's based off a real life story makes it all the more scarier!).The controls are easy to use, the game is not too basic nor complicated, and there are plenty of them (and they're rather familiar with other games). Graphics, textures are all fine, and the flow of gameplay compliments it well.Overall, I really enjoyed this game. I appreciate games like these that are affordable, fun to play, not complicated and that give you a few hours of enjoyment. I'd strongly recommend this to people who enjoy horror games."

,Recommended,291010,33791447,Posted: 25 July,all,Malkavian,"The Hat Man at it's core is aSlender Manclone with a few new brushes of paint for distinction. Consider this recommendation with a caveat -- only purchase if you are a fan of the Slender Man series. You play as a mother (or father) of your presumed missing institutionalized daughter. The hospital you last checked her in has not replied to your messages so naturally, you head over to investigate. The game begins with you riding up an elevator to the lobby of this hospital. To your surprise, you arrive to a desolated, dilapitated and somber hospital -- no one at the front desk, no nurses and all the doors seem locked. Graphics are nice, controls are easy -- again, Slender Man-esque. You walk up a set of stairs to a room where you find your daughter's journal. After reading it, the gamebegins. You are transported to theShadow Ward.I would like to emphasize to qualities of the Shadow Ward that serve as divergence points from the classic Slender Man series. If you stay too long in the room that teleports you to the Shadow Ward, (i.e. collecting journal papers or just looking around) strange shadow figures will start to appear and attack you. This happens occassionally throughout the game and the way to counter it is by pointing your flash light at them. Nothing revolutionizing, but a good small detail as far as Slender Man-esque games are concerned.This next quality is arguably the most reedeming quality of the game and one that I honestly wish more horror games would experiment with. After breaking a door with an axe you enter a maze in the hospotal where your task is to collect the missing journal entries while also escaping the Hat Man. The interesting part here is that the maze is constantly randomized. There are a few checkpoints that are stable but to the routes and locations of the journal entries are entirely randomized every time you hit a checkpoint or every time you restart the area.I think this is very ingenious and at least to my experience, something not most horror games do. I think it's a curious application of RNG that serves to disorient, displace and confuse the player. More so when you have Slender Man's cousin chasing after you. In other aspects, the story is easy to follow if you read the journal entries and the soundtrack is good as far as this niche sub-genre of games is concerned. All in all, The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a worthy attempt at a Slender-clone. It decidedly has its faults, does not revolutionize the genre, but it also has just enough redeeming qualities to appeal to hardcore fans of the horror sub-genre.If you enjoy the way I review games, join and follow my curator group!

Getting stuck on the monsters with no where to go (like on Stairs etc).If you want to know what this game is like, if you've ever played Slenderman (the original), it's just like that, in that you have to pick up papers (pages) to proceed.It just needs to be patched up a bit more and some of the 'player tested' mechanics adjusted, but it's definitely a nice little romp for cheap.

The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is just not that scary and slow developing. A little buggy and could have more time put into programming it properly but worth the $5 definitely.

Wrong Journal page is being read when you didn't even collect it yet (when you turn on Voice Over). When I died for the first time I didn't really get startled and believe me I startle easy. As my soul is being sucked out I hear a woman screaming who is probably the Mother; I chose to play as the father. Why did I give it thumbs up? It is a simple game programmed by someone who didn't charge us too much to have a few scary moments here and there and all in all the game is more fun that it isn't. It's still interesting to find out what is going on, the only thing I didn't encounter yet is that OUTRAGEOUS CONSTANT FEAR MODE. The fear which makes you question yourself ""why the hell am I doing this to myself?"" Even the voice of the Character you choose is so nonchalant (casual and meh) While he just saw a f*cking horrible sight. It's a nice twist to be honest, if you want to see it from that prespective; but it definitely lowers the fear factor of the game as well.

Basically a worse Slender game with more pages, and a slight advantage when collecting them.~~~Story:You can play as the mother or father of a girl, Virginia Berry, who was put in an insane asylum for attempting suicide. Virginia has gone missing, and you go a look for her. You pick up her journal, and it 'corrupts' you, and you must collect all 22 pages, and a few other items to save your daughter before the 'Shadow People' get you and capture your soul. As you collect the pages, it tells you a story of her reading the book about the HatMan after a woman told her to. She wasn't sure why, but she did.~~~A little Canton Insane Asylum background:Canton's Asylum is located in West Virginia in the United States. Congress has passes a bill creating the only 'Institution of Insane Indians' in the US. (So, I'm guess this family was Indian. [That's beside the point.]) It was opened in January 1903, this asylum was also sometimes called Hiawatha Insane Asylum. Many inmates put here were not mentally ill. The asylum closed in 1934. Atleast 121 died, and more than 350 patients were detained here.Flaws:-TV's were not invented until the 1927's. So I don't think that the TV's with static were a good placement for this time period.-I think if the developers did a little research on the place and time era, they could have made a better plot, giving an more intreaging story, and a better experience.~~~Sound:The sounds were hilarious for this game. The voice overs for the daughter, mother, and father, and the Hat Man. The Hat Man, when he takes you is the best noise in this game. (I'm kidding, it's also really bad.)To be honest, I actually like the music from the music players. They are not too bad.The pages make a whispering noise that is very obnoxious, and annoying. Maybe not to others, but to me, I did not like the noises for them.-If more time was put into the sound, it could have helped enchance the game play, and actually make this is a scary game.~~~Challenge:This game really isn't challenging... wait. Why can't I pick up my axe again after I used it? Okay...~~~I wouldn't recommend this game. The play time is short, and not very interesting to me.

You spend the game running away from the Hat Man and meanwhile collecting two kinds of items:- diary pages written by your daughter, explaining a bit what's going on and what you need to do next- items that help you advance e.g. at the very start there is a barricaded door => you pick up a nearby axe and use it to remove the obstacleThe asylum's hallways and rooms are continuously generated at random. So I didn't really like the fact that you couldn't rely on your memory and orientation skills to find your way in the asylum. You just need to keep running until you come across the item you need to advance to the next part of the asylum.What I did like about 'The Hat Man: Shadow Ward' is that you get a short thrilling experience for nearly no money at all. When I finished the game, I was surprised to see I got the achievement for finishing the game in under half an hour. It seemed longer what with the running around through the endless hallways and what with reloading when caught by the Hat Man. But the game shouldn't have been any longer than it is, because it's too 'basic' to entertain for hours. Now, at the price of this game (and especially when on sale) I think it's certainly worth playing if you're into the horror-atmosphere type games and are willing to settle for a quick, cheap fix."

I cannot complain for 19 cents.  The game is pretty bad though.  You'll hear the Hat Man in front of you and back into him when trying to escape.  It took me a while to get out of the first encounter.  It'll make you jump once or twice...  Maybe... lol  I I jumped twice, so I guess I got my 19 cents worth!  lol  :-)It's a huge Ward with many rooms to explore, but they pretty much all look the same.  It's an insane asylum, so expect that same look a lot...  The atmosphere is creepy and the sound effects help the tension build.  The sound effects and voice overs are decent.The graphics and lighting are good and set a spooky mood.  There's writing on the walls and blood on the floors.  Beds turned over and creepy black ooze in the tubs.  I haven't seen anything other than the Hat Man, so I am not sure there is anything else around to scare you.I really haven't played it long enough to give it a decent review, but it seems like a copy of Slender Man: The Arrival.  I actually like it a little better than Slender Man so far…  Slender Man just stands there.  At least this guy comes after you! lol :-)  Don't get me wrong, I didn't like Slender Man much either.It is a fairly taxing game on the system specs.  I had to lower my graphic's settings down quite a bit for smooth gameplay.

I wasn't able to finish it as the save system  didn't work right. Its not terrable, for a small company its good. It's pretty much slender, only weaker. The voices are also pretty bad. The two main character voices are extremely horrible and yet the girl voice isn't bad. The problem is that it tries a bit too hard to be slenderman and thats not something you can beat. Plus you can litterally see hat man and either outrun him, or hide from him pretty easily. Not to mention there is some hand holding as your screen makes noises when you get close to the paper or needed object. Still, it is scary even if asylum theme has been overused in games and is destroyed by games like Outlast that is amazing. Still, the jump scares are decent at times and the enviroment is spooky but the game isn't perfect. The developers are pretty amazing though as this game was free and they even gifted me another game they made which is pretty awesome. Overall, buy it on sale for practically free or get it for free by friending the group and making an honest review. You gotta start small before you get bigger."

There's a short story to it as well, that kind of explain why you're collecting them, and the creatures --the Hat Man and little shadow dudes-- that stalk you and want to stop you from reaching your goal are pretty damn spooky. As I always say with horror games, they're always WAY worse wen you play them for yourself.

There are voice overs, and the acting is competent.   It isn't terrible, but it isn't outstanding.  Like everything in this game.As mentioned, the game is in Unity.  The engine is smooth.  The graphics are not outstanding, but it animates well.  Moving your character is intuitive, although I found the movement a little awkward at times.  When there is something you can interact with a little hand will appear, and that is when you click.The entire game, however, is just a search for pages of your daughters diary.  There are a few mild scares, and the setting in general tries to be unsettling.  Walking around a generic assylum that was dark looking for paper.... well, it just got boring.If the game is on sale and you have some time to kill for a very average horror experience, pick it up.

,Recommended,291010,15620894,"Posted: 30 April, 2015",all,nice pie,"Prepare to die screaming…or more likely laughing at the horrendously bad voice acting of ‘The Hat Man: The 20+ Pages’……wait….wrong game (and more on the voice acting later).Alas, just as has happened with so many other indie horror games in recent years and with the advent of the Slender series, ‘The Hat Man: Shadow Ward’ (the ‘for real’ name) falls victim to the same ‘collect quest’ gameplay mechanic. This means that you need to find a set number of pages from your daughter’s diary to complete the game. Ultimately, that’s the basis of the game: you either play as the father or mother in search of said daughter, who has gone missing from the seemingly empty asylum she was committed to which is now populated by shadow people/The Hat Man (BTW – the idea of shadow peeps is based loosely on fact and there are many documented cases, and even some decent movies, about people that have seen or had encounters with these so-called ‘Shadow People’). Thankfully, you don’t just search for pages as you also need to find some other items to progress deeper into the asylum and defeat The Hat Man (who I guess is like the pimp of the shadow peeps) to get your daughter back.One of the more unique attributes of this game (though it’s been done before) is that sound is utilized to pinpoint the location of pages/other items you need by means of whispery voices. Also, the sound design of this game isn’t half bad for being a budget title, with some of the sound effects/ambient music being pretty creepy in my opinion.Now as promised, I must go back to my earlier comment about the voice acting. Granted, this game is super short and can be beat in less than half an hour, so you may think that voice acting wouldn’t be too important in such a game…..but it kinda, sorta totally is. Essentially, it’s hilarious. No, seriously, I’m not joking. I mean, it’s so stupendously bad that it’s good (I don’t know how that works; it defies the human intellect to comprehend how that can be) but it’s true. I figure most people will laugh at it, though some may actually want to cry at how bad it is. And for all those 100% achievement unlock Steamers out there – prepare thine selves!! There is actually an achievement for listening to your daughter reading the pages of her diary as you collect them. Sure, this game can fairly easily be ‘100%’d’ and the aforementioned achievement is easy enough to unlock, but don’t go joy-puking your faces off just yet as I seriously believe that listening to all of the pages may very well land you in an asylum. I personally just barely managed to keep my sanity intact while unlocking this achievement, so don’t say I didn’t warn you.This game can be fun for like 2 hrs tops, but I wouldn’t recommend it at full price, even if it is a budget title. With decent voice acting, who knows, perhaps this game could have been terrifying. As it is, it will likely be overlooked by most gamers, but it is somewhat interesting and good for a laugh….or cry, so give it a shot."

Also, any time he gets you, you go back to the beginning of the game and have to find all those pages again.-It has save points, but they are so scarce and far between that they're nigh nonexistent.-It has a graphics quality bar that changes literally nothing.-The only scary thing about this game is how awful it is. The Hat Man is about as scary as a hangnail. The Shadow People, even less.-Blatant Slender ripoff. Find pages while a shadowy entity chases you... Uh-huh.

Then you start running into problems. The clunky inventory system where i can only equip items by pressing the correct number (especially having to take my whole hand off wasd to press 7-0), which would have been managable if the rest of the game worked. The main ""boss"" of the game is a poorly scripted bot who will go through the entire world to get to you. That along with the randomly generated rooms makes him a pest more then a consistent scare. The rooms being randomly generated makes you wonder aimlessly, which would add to the autmosphere. If it didn't also make finding these objects just as random. Which would all be fine on some level if the game wasn't broken. One cannot advanced past the need of a lever. You cannot lift up the lever either.

The over all story isn't bad, it still needs a lot of work, but the main problems are this; its pretty much just another slenderman-styled game in terms of objective and enemies, the graphics are not that great, it is way too predictable, the hatman himself is a poor adversary and too slow, even in the updates, and he is not scary. In fact the hatman looks like a darker version of the Hatbox Ghost from Disney's Haunted Mansion. It would have been much wiser to replace the tophat with a fedora and made him look like the infamous shadow man seen throughout man decades by many people. I do not recomend getting this game unless it is given out for free or it is sold for at least $0.99. One would be better off buying a slenderman game and playing it for the slenderman would be far scarier and more panic inducing.

I'm pretty sure this *isn't* the scariest game of 2014.This *was* a fifteen dollar game that made Daylight look good. It's dropped to five and I suppose that's more reasonable than Daylight.The game itself is an obvious Slender clone, where you're running around grabbing pages while avoiding the monster. Unlike slender, however, the monster doesn't ever teleport. No, he just follows you around endlessly, and phases through walls. So if you get cornered, you may as well die then because I waited five minutes staring at him while crouched with no movement, whatsoever. It would seem like a breath of fresh air, since you can obviously outrun but not hide from the Hat Man, unlike in recent horror games where hiding is key. In this, you're running around to get pages with no places to hide, much like slender.The voice acting is pretty hilarious(ly bad), but the sound quality is alright. This really is just your average run-of-the-mill indie-horror game, with the same graphics, same UI, and same gameplay, except it's longer. Oh, and the layout of the hospital changes. It doesn't exactly randomize scares like Daylight, so there's not as much replay value (which implies loosely that there is some small replay value to Daylight, which is up to your interpretation)If it were any shorter than it already is it wouldn't qualify for the price it has. If it were any longer, I'd be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and begging myself that this goddamn game would be over.All in all, it's a fun... half-hour, and I can say it was worth the 19 cents I paid for it. maybe even worth $1.50-2.00.I can recommend the game to you, but not at the price.

Nothing fancy here, I won't go too far into it because of spoilers.Gameplay: C+. Apart from the first room which teaches you how to look for items (by listening for them), there is no other tutorial so to speak. The objective is to find all the pages to your Daughter's lost journal and to solve puzzles using certain items to get past obstructions. The rooms are randomly generated so there is no map, while this may make it confusing it ultimately doesn't matter, the game still progresses in linear fashion. I haven't quite figured out how to avoid Hat Man, but you'll know if he's close by when the screen flickers, your heart starts pounding, and the wind nearby sounds all distorted. As for scariness, I personally did not get too spooked even when getting caught my first time. In fact I was more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off than anything. Results may vary for others, but for me it just didn't freak me out at all. Overall the game can be completed fairly quicky once you find out what to do (I suggest reading a walkthrough, it helps).Performance: C. It's a unity game, so don't expect too many graphical issues like low framerate or glitches. I'm pretty sure just about any PC made after 2003 would be able to run it smoothly. The movement controls are fine, but using items and performing actions seem to have a considerable lag. There were times where left-clicking a door to open it took several times for it to work.Presentation: F. As with the issues with the graphics I mentioned earlier, It doesn't seem like a lot of effort was put into this game. Although it looks like a considerable amount of people worked on this game according to the credits, this game feels like something a dev team of 3-5 people could've made in about a month. Also, it seems like most of the achievements are broken and unobtainable due to bugs. Forum members brought this up back in May 2015 and they have not been addressed as of October. So it seems like support this game has been abandoned.Overall this game is barely worth it at 19 cents and I definitely would not recommend paying full price for this title."

As far as being scary, this game does an okay job.  The feeling of vulnerability with no weapon and the ability to lose the game by getting ""caught"" is a little nerve-racking, but otherwise, this game isn't quite there.The weapon you DO get is immediately used up.  You can't pick it up after you use it, which I find weird since it doesn't look hard to pick back up if it were real life.The Journal Pages you need to collect don't add much to the spookiness of it, and are slightly broken.  You get some voice-over for the Journal pages, but some of the pages have text and voiceover that don't match, like the voice is for a completely different page, crushing the illusion.You don't really know where to go and just hope you're going in the right direction.  No maps or anything.  This would be fine, but the scenery you get lost in is repetative, so it gets old after a while.Clicking to open things seemed un-respsonsive.  ""Click to Open"" with a hand icon on the screen, but clicking doesn't do anything unless you click like nine times.When you first get the ability to scare away shadows, it's creepy and works well.  When you encounter the Hat Man, however, you get the impression that it's supposed to work, but ends up failing, making you move too slowly to get away.I DID like how it stops you if you ""miss something"".  The game actually says ""You missed something"" if you don't pick up a vital item, which I thought was a nifty touch.Anyway, like I said, not a loss at all for 19 cents, but that's where I'd draw the line."

Anybody can slap a horror atmosphere and put a slightly creepy character into the came, by the way, black doesn't mean scary and ghosts don't mean scary, the villain isn't good at all. Then I have to mention the placements of save points, that is, as far as I've played, you need to find the pages of journals, but it doesn't save after you find an entire journal, so if you put a good half hour into looking for most of the pages just to be caught by the hat man you are sent back to the book. Sorry, the game is not of quality and should really been given away for free. Cry of Fear had the right idea and that game was at least good, not great mind you, but still good."

Avoid the fairly cheesy-looking villain as he chases you through walls (or gets stuck in a doorway, which I've seen happen twice now). Collect missing pages from a book. Try to figure out how in the hell to save your game. (There's apparently an option for it, but damn if I know how it works). Die, and start over again from the beginning. Turn off, and go do something else.I don't want to be overly cruel -- the devs did a good job with the sound effects, and were somewhat successful in inducing nervousness in the player through the ""stalker"" nature of the villain rather than through cheap jump scares. But the repetitiveness of the environment design and the lack of a reliable save feature eventually make the game too tedious to devote much time to. I might give this another shot someday, but for now it's going back on the shelf.Update: I've tried replaying this turd on and off again over the course of a year, and every time, I find it to be a tedious slog that depends more on procedurally-generated luck than actual skill.

The gameplay mechanics were sloppy for me & the story is non-existed or empty. It can be creepy in the beginning but after about 20 minutes you quickly become accostomed to the evil spirit & find it more of an annoyance when it's chasing you.I only recommend if you can play a demo first or if you LOVE chase/horror games where you have to pick up items before it finds you.

The shocking moments are very strong and the extra adrenaline shot in your blood because of you have only one life and if you die you need to do the whole thing from the beginning are making this game worth its money.I only bought it because I had a 50%-OFF coupon but if I lose my account i would buy this for the full price again!

This is amazingly atmospheric and so engaging. I set the resolution to 1920x1080 and quality to Fantastic, turned out the lights and turned up my headphones. The graphics and audio are actually really good. The game has a dark, gritty feel to it so I'm guessing that's where all the bad quality reviews are coming from. The controls are wasd standard by default, but you can customize them to your liking. Movement felt pretty fluid with no lag. I became completely engrossed had more ""wtf was that???"" moments than I've had in quite awhile. When the HatMan ate my soul (on toast with jam?) and I turned on the lights to find out who put poo in my shorts, I was amazed that only 12 minutes had passed. I spent more time petting my cat to calm down than I did playing the game. No, I wouldn't pay 60 bucks for it, but I feel great about what I did pay. Do yourself a favor and get this."

,Recommended,291010,10688758,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,Mightyfoxxy,"So far I'm loving this game. It does remind me a bit of Slender, but without the annoying mechanic that fuzzes over the camera .Graphics: 7/10: It has a very creepy and proper feel to it, but the graphics can get a bit old after a while. Granted it's in beta, so hopefully during official release it will have been touched up. The monster has a rather nice graphics effect when it gets closer and can be seen, granted the ACTUAL Hat Man, is rather hard to make out within the fog till he's right up on you.Sound/Music: 6/10 The sounds and audio are great at first, but after a while they stop being scary, especially when you're having trouble finding pages and are feeling frustrated. The heartbeat mechanic of Hat Man getting closer, is a rather awesome way to tell how close he is and act accordingly, but during the last several pages, when he is popping up all the time (in some of my videos like ever 30 seconds or less), it can get extremely annoying as it becomes all you hear. Still it's in beta, hopefully that'll be polished a bit to where he doesn't pop up so often when you're being super cautious or it isn't as deafening. This is a game you have to play with the sound though, otherwise finding pages will be EXTREMELY hard.Gameplay: 7?/10: I put the ? because I may changed it and move it up, at the present point, I still haven't beaten the game (13 out of ?? pages), though I've finally started to get the hang of it. Hat man is a nice enemy as you can sneak by him and even juke around him (this requires some skill), the stealth works very nicely in the game and leads to some funny survival moments. As you collect more, it seems that real traps start to appear (or there is just a giant pitfall to your death at one point). My only issue with the gameplay is that it's not entirely clear what somethings are for, namely the Matches...I've found Matches, I think they unlock more pages (as I get stuck on 7 pages, find a box and boom I start finding more), maybe a tiny bit of clarity on that...granted could be a journal page I haven't gotten to read yet.Overall: 7/10 likely to improve up with future edit. It's a good game, if you like this type of game. It could be a little more clear on some issues and have some audio configuration options (there is no way to effect the sound which means if you record, you'll be lower the games sound level during editing). I'd say buy it, especially before it gets closer to finished and increases in price."

My first impression of the game was that once you get in to the shadow realm or whatever you want to call it, very creepy and atmospheric. Like a lot of other horror games that have been released recently, it's Slenderman essentially. Run around with the threat of a being always present and trying to kill you. That does'nt make the game boring though, don't get me wrong! The game is actually good! It has it's own little story in which you are trying to find your daughter who has ""dissappeared"". All the notes you pick up are hand written notes by your daughter which give you a really cool back story! So if you are killed by The Hat Man, (who is actually very creepy), you have that feeling of, ""Hey! I want to go back in there, and find out what happened to my daughter!"" The game is very interesting and actually makes you want to complete the game and get the story, instead of some Slender games in which you just collect the notes for the sake of getting notes. Overall I give the game a 7.5/10. Great atmosphere, the sounds are really nice and creepy, and the plot behind it makes you want more. Good game.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpCQAcyeJ4w&list=UUzkSzcLFfyYwG2yKZRWB_XwHere is my first video on the game. Check out the gameplay for yourself before purchasing the game.

The Hat Man is a cool monster and the enviorment is awesome what is ruining the game for me is that the person you play talks and sounds way to calm for the sistation they are in. About a minute in to the game you are pulled in to The Hat Man's world and he calmly says something along the lines of wow now you have my attention. It breaks the emersion and kinda kills the horror aspect of the game. another line after you just axed down a door was Oh I never knew I was so good at breaking things. It just seems very out of place and would of been better left out altogether. It could also be alittle darker Hat Man is a shadow being or something and the games called shadow ward but some hallways are bright like I didn't even need a flash light bright and when I saw Hat Man in those places he just looked comical. Don't get me wrong this is a good game just needs alittle more polish and it could be a great game. I found out they have a thing to shut off the parents voice over. I highly recomend doing that.

The model quality lacks and you end up being more afraid of wheelchairs and lights than the hat man himself.PLEASE. PLEASE. Work on the Hat Man, the user should be afraid of him, they should not be able to wander the map for almost an hour without seeing him. Perhaps using mechanics similar to 'One Late Night' would suit the gameplay.I hope you take this into consideration, I look forward to seeing how the game develops.TL;DR Great atmosphere but the Hat Man isn't all he is hyped up to be. It's not just about the review anymore."

The amazing thing about this game is that some how the game randomizes itself, as you are playing. Not just the spawing of the enemies or where the things you need to find are but the entire stinking map. You can seriously walk through one halway practically forever becasue it constantly is changing and building the areas of the map. You can leave one area and go straight and end up right back where you were.

I quit the game right then. And it doesn't help that it's hard to determine where you've been and where you haven't. Everything is like a maze! I understand that being a horror game, it's designed to build tension, but c'mon! It's very unforgiving knowing that if I get captured, I'm gonna have to do this crap all over again! Some kind of map would be nice. Or at least grant me the option to save when ever I want, or at the very least quicksave. I think it's pretty safe to say that no one likes starting from the beginning, (or close to it) that's usually when people start to lose interest.

The game itself isn't very original...its a horror game located in a hospital (an obvious and easy choice for a horror game), with the main objective of collecting pages (like slenderman) while getting chased by the hat man (which is not an original character). The story and characters could have been more developed as well as the lore behind the hat man and shadow people. I'm not a big fan of the 'background story getting told through a mysterious journal the main character finds' get up because I feel it is a lazy way to tell a story.

You hear the monster come from miles away and when you meet him all you have to do is jog for a couple of seconds in the opposite direction to get rid of him. Also he looks like an idiot.For an horror game, a silly looking non-threatening monster is quite underwhelming.I got it for 0.19€ so it's just a ""meh"", but it's absolutely not worth the original 4.99€"

This game has come pretty far from the beta release when I started playing and is a fair challenge pretty similar to most slender games (Find pages and get out). Beware the shadow people, they will kill you just as quickly as the hat man, and they spawn in random locations. The game is still worth it and I would love to see titles from this producer in the future and see improvement inn their work. They have something going but they aren't 100% on track yet. Still a pretty good game."

The creature chasing you is pretty creepy and the way you know he's close is a pretty good idea, you're flashlight starts flickering a little and so you know you need to get the hell out of there. Finding pages isn't that hard since you'll start hearing loud whispering when you come near one, it makes it a lot easier since it would just blend in witheverything else in the game. Graphics are nothing special but not ugly by any means.Con's:Now the level you go through is pretty bland and everything pretty much looks the same without any sense of progression. It's also very linear exept for the occasional choice in differing paths. The creature that's after you is creepy, but not scary. The game will eventually turn into ""run away from monster and quickly pick up notes"". He will not really scare you for about 98% of the game. The items you pick up are also pretty stupid like the axe you just leave behind after using it once. also at some parts you have to use particular items to continue, this will either cause you to back track a bit, or die to the creature chasing you.Over all, I would only say buy this on a steam sale when it's under $0.30 since you really won't be losing that much money if you happen not to like the game.This game gets a 6/10."

If you don't get scared easly then don't buy this game it is mostly just jump scares but there is a story in the game that is creepy as well. The reason I recommend this game to people like me is because I have anxiety and games like outlaast etc. give me nightmares alot of them etc. so this is one of the few scary games I can enjoy without having sleep issues etc.

And for a while, the only thing to scare you is your imagination as you go through a literal endless 1st level that's extremely hard to find anything in, but after a while you learn that this game isn't going to abuse you, it's going to take things slow, maybe a little too slow for a horror game, but then on the second level, it starts getting a little scarier with better ambience, Hatman gets faster and goes through walls for some great jumpscares, as well as an even creepier atmosphere and a little more progress through the story, though not much. Even so, it's a pretty well made game and I'm so excited that the official release finally came. However, there are still some issues that I don't quite like.. Not too big but issues: TOO BIG! Holy crap finding your way through this place and collecting items is harder than a dark souls boss, and progression through 1 level can take maybe an hour if you're not familiar with the game, and seeing the same thing over and over again isn't fun. The second issue is that Hatman only gets harder through levels and not time.I should know, because I'm one of the people who spent an hour on the first level. As you're looking through the first floor frantically looking for missing pages, or an item you may have missed, you get lost easily and well.. It stops being fun. Mostly because Hatman is like a companion you can kill but respawns.. Kind of like Tails in the sonic franchise, he never dies and he will come back later but.. You can kill him again easily. The problem with this is like a battle in skyrim against a townie who can't die, you can hit him over and over and over and over again but he won't go down for good, and the battle is infinite because you can't die to him either. The only option is to step outside and face the guards waiting for you,,,, though in this game that's more like the only option is to keep searching for items..But other than ALL of that, great game!"

So I occasionally buy horror games in the hope of finding something like the good Silent Hill games but sometimes I end up buying games as dire as this one.On my first attempt, right near the start I picked up the diary and immediately died. Okay so I assumed that was not what I was supposed to do. After scouring the rest of the room I found out I was supposed to pick up the diary but just the game had spawned an enemy right in my face.Having got past that hurdle I was able to start the game properly. I’m the type of person who when they play a game they wants to explore all the game has to offer so I tend to look round the whole area before moving on. So I started methodically exploring the level and quickly got frustrated as I kept stumbling onto things to progress the game but there were so many avenues I hadn't explored. The same rooms were reused over and again so there was no way to keep track of where I had been without a map. Only at this point did I realise that the map was not fixed it just procedurally generates the map using the same handful of rooms. Upon realising this I lost any remaining interest in the game. All there was left to do was aimlessly wander through the same rooms over and again till the things you need to progress appear.In the latter part of the game the enemies move faster and spawn closer to you. So whether you win or lose felt entirely arbitrary, depending on how the items and enemies spawn and nothing to do with the players input.The one thing I did like was the voice actor playing your daughter, she did a good job. This then directly contrasts with the voice actor of the mother. She is so bad I honestly wasn't sure if she was a voice synthesizer at first.All in all the only saving grace of this game is that I bought it in the sale for 19p but still I could spent that on something useful like an onion."

Other than that, for the asking price, it is worth it for the scares; I even had nightmares twice after playing the game, so if you are looking for scares, buy this game. I would recommend that you turn the book reading voice off though.ProsScary atmosphereScary ambienceShadow People and the Hat Man himself deliver the scaresGood graphicsConsBad quality voice actingVoice does not match one (or more) of the pages being shown in the bookScream is the same regardless of whether playing as mother or fatherOverall: 92.5% recommendation"
