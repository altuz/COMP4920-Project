EliotThis is the first visual novel that I've played from Winter Wolves, and I must say that I'm not impressed.Always Remember Meis an otome game with a somewhat ordinary concept, annoyingly stereotypical characters, suicidally repetitive choice actions and a scarcity of events about the main story to keep you interested. At this point, I must confess that I've completed my first playthrough quite easily and gave in a reaction of ""seriously?"" at the first ending that I've discovered. During my second playthrough... I got bored and wandered off to do something else, forgetting the game running. When I remembered that I was playing the game, I came back and gave in 2 more hours of the gameplay to collect the missing achievements - a.k.a. fast-forwarded through some repetitive actions and only read event dialogues. Thus, my gaming time.Let me introduce you to Amarantha - called as Amy by friends - literature student, part time worker in an ice-cream parlor and a boringly plain young woman that you could define in 3 adjectives completely: fickle, stereotypical and automated. At the start of our gameplay, Amy has a motorcycle accident alongside her boyfriend Aaron - which fills in the young, rich and handsome stereotype. Amy survives with some moderate wounds but alongside a slight concussion, Aaron now has amnesia. He doesn't remember a thing about Amy. At this point, it is up to us to either patiently wait by our amnesiac boyfriend to help him regain his memories or run after a limited selection of other handsome young man who might become equally interested with us - namely Lawrence, Eddie and Hugh; appropriately filling in the shy cutie, the workaholic overachiever and the charming artist stereotypes in that order.So... As you may observe, our heroine hypothetically overcomes the trauma of losing ""the love of her life"" quite easily. She - and any other cute boy that she may end up with - are written really badly. They all consist of stereotypes with shallow reactions, superficial dialogue options and boringly unimaginative personalities. One could claim that I shouldn't expect much literary narrative or originality from an otome game to begin with, but without the visual novel quality of an interesting story or interesting enough characters - or at least decent narrative - I most certainly see no reason to spare my time specifically to experience a couple cute pictures of pretty anime characters kissing and some really lame dialogue note at the side. Sorry, but this is what the game eventually ends up being so.For the gameplay: you have 4 romance options, 4 stats that you can raise through completing more or less the same actions for a period of 3 months. Each stat concerns one of the romance option as a target. You wake up, work in the parlor, visit the romance option, raise stats with a limited selection of actions, sleep and repeat. Oh, and once in a while you stumble upon an event where you'll get a relationship raise if you are to choose the right one in the dialogue options. Eventually, you hit an ending for the boy that you picked, witness a cheesy ""happily ever after"" scene and carry on. Nothing else. No surprise factor, no real challenge, no in-depth story. Nothing. You repeat the same action for the millionth time while getting harassed by the endless repetition of the same 8 note soundtrack to be rewarded by a cute picture and 3-4 sentences telling how happy you ended up. Brilliant.Many would blame me to already know what I would get myself involved with when I picked an otome game to play, but with games from Cheritz or Hanako Games of the same genre in the market, you really should skip this if you are not getting it in a bundle, like super cheap. Else, consistently avoid this one to enjoy another VN or otome with more imaginative gameplay or at least better character concepts and/or story.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

Great art, nice characters, dramatic, but realistic enough backstory and 9 different kind of endings (if you count 'alone' ending to be one). Music is also nice, but for my taste maybe a little too repetitive. After all, it's a really beautiful and kind of cute game.How ever there is a big problem with this game. After a little while playing it really starts to repeat itself, like REALLY repeat. When you become familiar with how all of it works you're just basicly waiting for some random events to trigger and your friendship to increase with your chosen character. Also you have to know who you are going after from the day one in this game. Otherwise you'll just run out of time and end up getting alone ending. I can't say much about endings, because I haven't played all of them yet. But from what I've seen... they're not that strong and feel kind of flat.But well, after all I still must say that it's okey game. I've played better visual novels before, but can't really say it's bad either. If you like visual novels then I'd say give it a try."

I had some expectations before playing this game since the visuals seemed fairly appealing and I actually wasn't disappointed by the (few) CGs - they were drawn well and the character designs weren't bad either. But that's it, everything else made me - bluntly said - dislike the game.The characters' sprites during the cutscenes looked weird (e.g. when Amy cried her posture/gesture didn't change at all, her posture stayed the same throughout the game and the same with the other characters). Additionally, the game seemed to focus more on the stat raising mechanic than the romance plot itself, leading to some annoying and boring ""save & load"" back and forth since you want to raise your stats as soon as possible in order to get both endings easily. Lastly, the endings to every route in this game. Briefly said, they were also very disappointing. A short cutscene with CG as a reward and during those cutscenes, you couldn't really feel the love between the protagonist and her final love interest - you just couldn't feel this achievement which you want to have as the player in every dating sim.All in all, I'm glad they took another step forward to localising dating sims in the west and I don't regret buying ARM since it helped supporting the localisation. Still, I probably wouldn't have bought it for another reason."

It felt bland, uninspired and didn't leave much of an impression on me. It's superficial at best and it's all about stat raising and not enough story.  Though the art looks well done it's additionally let down by the UI which I firmly disliked and didn't allow me to fully immerse myself in it. Everything is cookie-cutter and failed to employ cliches effectively and I won't be looking forward to any Winter Wolves games in the future."

The ending was the biggest flaw. I got both the special and normal ending for Eddy and I felt zero difference between the two. There also was absolutely no build up to the ending.The male characters just sort of eventually confess to Amy, with not much having happened between them since this game focuses just a little, little too much on stat building...and then the player is left a little confused as to whether or not Amy is actually dating the love interest (because even if a different guy confesses to hear and she says something like ""I think I have feelings for you, too"", she still visits her boyfriend with Amnesia at the hospital and gets upset when his ex girlfriend is there).After that, once you either fill the 'love meter' or play up until the 'deadline', it just skips straight to a short ending scene with your hubby without any build up or conflict in the story (besides the whole amnesia storyline).Despite all of this, I did very much like three of the love interests. The boyfriend with amnesia was a little too plain to be so much trouble for my tastes..but these bishies were still interesting and the sort that plenty of people can get attached to (such as myself).Amy, the heroine, is also very likable and the game has fantastic artwork (not to mention a fairly nice soundtrack which I better liked by purchasing the deluxe edition of the game).All in all, not the greatest otome and it didn't handle the stat building particularily well (and I think the new game Backstage Pass did a better job of that..), but it was cute and charming.It just is NOT the sort of thing if you've played a lot of visual novels or otome games. There's  very little text and it's mostly stat building (which is great if you prefer it that way..I just am used to reading a lot and making tough decisions in my vn's and otomes)."

There are only four potential romantic partners, though they are fairly well-detailed and likable. Protagonist herself, Amy also gets a lot of characterization rather than just being a stand-in for the player. And your every action, successful or not, gets a description of how it went, done in Amy’s quirky style!Also as expected of a dating sim, your character has several stats, and doing your daily job for money as well as variety of activities to increase one or more stat is integral part of the gameplay.Storytelling-wise, there are some lovely moments, but nothing truly touched me as some moments in other visual novels and dating sims did. Overall, I enjoyed the story well enough, although I wouldn’t call it that great either.I can recommend Always Remember Me to all fans of dating sims.

If you want an actual visual ""novel"" with, like, writing that doesn't repeat itself a trillion times and has the same quality as a Newgrounds flash game (not an exaggeration in the least), maybe with voice acting or decent music or meaningful event sequences, maybe even some animation--forget it, it's not there.Don't be sucked in by the good premise. It goes absolutely nowhere. I love VNs and I love story-based games, and dating sims can be done well. There's almost no writing, and all of it is atrocious. Nothing works. The art never changes, the activities don't change, the events repeat hundreds of times, and reaching an ending is nothing more than repeating the same actions over and over and over again. It's not fun, and it doesn't lead to anything interesting at any point.Not even Cristina Vee singing the game's theme song can save it. The best part of the game is the title screen and the intro. Beyond that, don't expect anything better. I'm serious, I'm super-forgiving when it comes to this, but this is absolutely no deeper than a standard flash game.

I'll summarize it using my notes from finishing the game's routes back then.If you want something short, sweet, but ultimately meaningless: Go for this game.If you want a more substantial VN/stat-raising game, go for something like Backstage Pass.Always Remember Me was nice on a shallow end, but ultimately not something I'd ever touch again unless it was simply to bust out the last achievement I failed to get for completion's sake, and I honestly don't feel it's worth it.  During earlier days when there was almost nothing substantial or worthwhile for otome game lovers to play, this was an option.  I simply don't think it's worth it anymore when there's infinitely better things to play these days, and I felt like I'd wasted my time even before that.There's some cute elements to this game, and one surprising one - I was surprised by the stalker subplot, but it's so tiny it hardly bears being called a subplot, and it could've been handled in a much more interesting way.TL;DR: Do not recommend.  There's better stuff out there, and unless the sequel to this game that just game out is a SIGNIFICANT improvement, there's no point in peeking at this one."

There aren't really any choices to make during the game but one, straight from the beginning: who to date? And the choice is given at the beginning, before the actual start of the game, as long as the key attribute to level to get to the ""special ending"" that is not brought really step by step, just comes from ""It's nice to visit"" to ""we'll spend the rest of our life together"" in a blink.

But the characters lack emotions and personality. Everything is just.. Plain. Simple. Waaaay too simple… The story itself was kinda cliché but I tried to give it a chance. I regret my previous decision…There are irrelevant characters (like Amy’s aunt), and to be honest, it’s all about status raising. I’m not a fan myself of games like that but depending on the stories, characters and events, it can be done right. But Always Remember Me lacks ALL THAT. The events (where you know, you can actually interact with the character you want to date) are so short and they happen so rarely. And they are just.. Bad. Too simple. You can’t feel a connection between the characters.The endings, both normal and special, are too fast and… Meh. I honestly cleared the whole game just because I wanted all the achievements. :-/Oh, and there’s the music. It’s not bad, honestly. But it plays so often and SO LOUD that it pierces my ears and makes my brain scream in agony. Also the instrumental version (or whatever version that suddenly plays when you’re going to the icecream shop) sounds so out of place. Makes no sense, I don’t know how to explain… And the main song keeps playing over and over, at weird times and… Jesus. What a mess.3/10.

That said, I came into this with an open mind, but unfortunately I just can't see any redeeming qualities here.The writing is flat out terrible, very amature level stuff.  The music is pretty bland (and I paid extra for the soundtrack) and the gameplay is DULL (if you can even call it gameplay).  It's more of a click-and-read-along story, and occiasionally you get to specify what activity you want to do, with apparently random results that require no action or effort from the player.I'm not opposed to dating sims by any stretch, but if you want to build relationships within a game, companies like Tell Tale and BioWare did it much better.  And while I realize those aren't exactly apples-to-apples comparisons, I think it's fair to demand better writing and character interaction from a game that is essentially 100% text based, and maybe expect just a little more to engage the player rather than occasionally clicking a choice here and there.I'm sure I'm not the original intended demographic for the game, but I like to think I'm objective enough, and sadly that's the best I can say about this.  That said, I'm sure many will enjoy this game for what it is, and that's fine.I hope this information is useful."

It seems to be one of Winter Wolves's earlier efforts, as it is slightly unpolished (compared to more recent titles). The plot is decent enough, as your character Amarantha (Amy) has just been in an accident with her boyfriend Aaron. Aaron protected her from most of the impact, at the cost of amnesia. Amnesia that wiped most of the last few years from his mind... including your relationship. Do you stick by him, or do you fall for someone else? (Think ""While You Were Sleeping"", except you actually were in the relationship.)I was unsure about this game for a while, but finally decided to try it, as Winter Wolves make some great visual novels. But I think this is a decent enough game to buy (though maybe wait until it is discounted).Also, note that it has a sequel ""Never Forget Me"", which likely makes the ""Happily Ever Afters"" of this game a bit... premature."

Both endings were equally uninspiring and in both endings there was text referring to past events that never occurred in my games.The music was repetitive and got super annoying after a while, not to mention the opening song had very grating vocals.To put the icing on the cake (or the sprinkles on the ice cream if we want to stay with Always Remember Me's theme) the little comics in the extras section were completely cringe worthy. ""I LOVE YOU!"", ""Oh noes!"". Please stop with the poor attempts at humour and the out of date internet slang, as a reader I actually felt second hand embarrassment.With the exception of the chibis the art was pleasing so that's one thing this game had going for it.I hate to sound so negative but there really wasn't much I enjoyed about this game. For a story that has so much to do with writing it's kind of sad how poor the plot/dialogue is, however I acknowledge that writing fiction is difficult, especially when there are multiple endings.

Even when I get held back by Amy's energy, I could easily get both routes finished in time. This game was extra fun playing while on Skype with someone as they did male voices and I did female voices, so if you wanna make this game extra enjoyable, get a friend to help with the voices.

The story is a neat premise, the main character's boyfriend has amnesia so she can either stick it out with him or pursue three other dudes. The characters themselves aren't annoying, but they don't really stick out that much either. That's unfortunately because you don't actually get to see most of their personality unless you pursue them as a love interest and even then you only get a few choice-related events with them. Then again, maybe it was meant to be that way since they're suppose to be simple characters and not soap opera cliche characters. Although, its neat how the game incorporates morale and energy levels in it, and its pretty simple to figure out how to best balance out those stats.As far as this review goes, I've only played through Aaron's and Lawrences's normal and special endings. Aaron's special ending was the only ending from those four that had a smooth transition for its end relationship. The other four endings just pop up abruptly once you max out the guys' love meters, almost as if they were an after-thought in the story designing process. And I'm unsure if those endings take place right there or later on in the future. Don't get me wrong, I still had fun playing the game, but those ending transitions needs a bit of work.I'd recommend picking the game up when its on sale if you want a nice short dating sim."

It's not stellar, but it's not bad either; still, I can't recommend it with clear conscience.First off, the story is nice, if bland. You won't remember it (pun... mostly intended) as something that gave you All The Feels, but it's cute enough to play through when you have some downtime. The characters are hardly complex, but mostly pleasing, and the dialogue seems fine, if you keep in mind that it's a short game without any deeper moments other than Aaron's amnesia (which presents an interesting situation that is handled okay, but could've been developed more).I also like the art well enough - I don't really see why some people seem to have a problem with it, since it's very nice imho and I've seen way, way worse sprites and CGs in some other VNs I played.There is, however, an issue that ultimately led me to the negative review: the game mechanics. I'm not talking about stat raising - an element which I personally hate, given how annoying it turns in every (however good) game, but I understand why it's used. I'm talking about the fact that key scenes with each of the characters trigger based on approval, but there's still a random element to WHEN you get them. That means that if you raise your relationship points (or other stats!) too quickly, you can easilly miss out on even scenes that are essential to each route. People playing otome games want to have their hard-earned confession scenes served on a silver plate, not accidentally skipped while only getting the happy epilogue. And yes, that happens in ARM - Lawrence's route is the best example.All in all, you might have fun with this game, but only if you are willing to pace your play carefully so you don't miss out on anything. And I definitely wouldn't get it for the full price; I bought it on sale (75% off) and that's about as much as the game is worth."

Makes it even worse.I think otome games with stats can be done right, but this game is not an example of it. Raising your stats or even points for whatever guy takes up about 90% of the game. There are not that many scenes or much of a story to this game. And the plot is kinda lame as well. Not worth your money even if it's on sale.A+ art for the people though."

There was only 1 track that stood out to me. The instrumental theme song that comes on at random is really annoying.- The only voice option is the chibi protagonist's reaction to how well you performed a task. It becomes quite repetitive and annoying immediately, so I ended up muting it.- Horribly structured amnesia plot which makes the writing unrealistic. The intro leads into the main love interest's route, but for the sake of having other love interests, forces the MC to be a shallow person by abandoning him to date another character. The plot continually pushes the main love interest's involvement throughout the story as something important, when it doesn't have any direct impact to the other routes.- Huge lack of character development/character scenes. It makes the pacing of the game awful. I really feel like the scenes you get are randomized, because there is a screenshot in the community hub of a character that I have never run into in any of my playthroughs.- Endings felt more like quick epilogues with no real conclusion at the end. There were little differences between both route endings.- Stat grinding felt boring. Even being efficient with saving and reloading to get the most points in the shortest time was still a chore.- No incentive to do a harder difficulty. It's just not fun."
,Recommended,291030,9952226,"Posted: 27 April, 2014",all,niX,"Always Remember Me is a dating simulator/visual novel in which the main character finds herself making tough choices about her love life after the current love of her life forgets her after an accident causes him to have amnesia.As far as dating sims go, this one is short and sweet. It's got very simplistic choices and game mechanics, which makes it enjoyable for those experienced with the genre or those who are just trying it out for the first time. The game takes place over a 3 month time period and features eight different endings. The first playthrough will take about 2-3 hours, which means that it's not an overally demanding time commitment even if you are going for a 100% run for all the endings/achievements.Although the game can be a bit repetative (as are most dating sims), I definitely recommend it. It's not overwhelming, but the game still offers enough that I wanted to keep coming back to it. There are four different choices of love interests, all vastly different for all kinds of players. The story isn't overbearing, but it does tear at your heart strings a little, which is more than enough, as I personally don't like a dating sim to feel overally cheesy or mushy. The game is also very clean, with no nudity or profane language.The few cons that I will include is the steep price tag. For the less than 10 hours of game play I got out of it, 17.99 hardly seems worth it (even though I got it on sale for 15.00). I didn't feel ripped off because I enjoyed the game, but if you're not completely sold on the idea of this game, wait until it goes on sale before purchasing.Another con is that the events with your potential love interests can feel far and in between. When you do finally get an event, the event is rather short and that can feel unrewarding. This is due to the game's short time span/play time."

Yes, you can help your amnesiac boyfriend regain his memories, and yes there are occassionally sweet moments, but the pacing is horridly off. You can visit your potential boyfriend every single day and only run into dialog between your character and him MAYBE once a week if you're lucky. What little dialog there is also doesn't help bridge the gap between starting to like someone and falling in love, which leads to an awkward jarring ending. Within a few hours you can hit the end of the game, which is disappointing, and it goes even quicker if you decide to skip dialog for a second playthrough.The gameplay itself isn't nearly as important as the story, but it's supposed to keep the game decently paced, but once again it fails. You end up grinding for stats almost everyday of the week, and other than plot items, money is nearly useless as regular activities are usually just as useful for stat growth, especially since you only need ONE stat at max to get the special endings. Because of the randomness of the stat-growth, moods, and money it can easily become a slow mess of saving and loading as you grind for your ideal outcome. It only slows the pacing and artificially lengthens the game, which is sad for such a short story.The audio gets old quick with an upbeat soundtrack that repeats far too often. It's especially obvious when going about your daily routine on the town map. It's a relatively small gripe, but it's worth mentioning.In conclusion, the game had romantic moments but ultimately lacked the dialog and pacing required to make a romance believeable. I wouldn't recommend this one."

When I say expanded I would like it to be either 3rd person or from first person and to have the world be 2 or 3D. Persona or Catherine is a good example.

The game gives you major penalities when you pick the wrong answer.The intro said that she is in school, but the game itself starts in summer. It would have been neat to see her in school.

Artwork is pretty, but i don't think think this game is particular enjoyable aside from that. There isn't enough dialogue and any worthwhile plot which is a shame since this can go so far. There is no voices throughout the story aside from her going ""whoohoo!"" ""pretend you didn't see that"" if that is something you care for(i do admittingly).It involves stat grinding, which i'm decently used to. However it is random if you succeed or fail any tasks you choose to ever do, so it causes you so you have to save and reload farrr more than i'd like to than normal. The only rewarding thing about stat boosting is if you hit 100 relationship and 99 of a specific stat for the character you can end the game early if you 'wanted' to.Don't bother with this game if you want an enjoyable plot/value for your effort.  If somehow i'm still not able to convince you, Do NOT buy this at full price-you're gonna waste your money.However as a poster mentioned here which i agree to, is that i don't have a regret getting this game.

Seems like a stereotypical bf in the beginning, but he can't remember anything about him and Amy.Lawrence: Amy's coworker at the ice cream shop. He's the type to worry over everything and doesn't know what to do in emotional situations. Unreasonably passive but cares a lot for Amy.Hugh: A random guy who's friends with Amy (and maybe Lawrence too?) and owns a shop in the mall. He cares a lot for Amy, but in a different sense than Lawrence. Kind of a womanizer type of character.Eddy: Aaron's doctor in the hospital. He's a workaholic and lacks the ability to cook or do any sort of house chore because of his busy schedule. A deadpan mostly, but he keeps a close eye on Amy.Final Impressions:This game is worth around $5-$7 at most due to the lack of a storyline and a cast of underdeveloped characters. It had a good premise, but the way the story plays out just doesn't work well with the interactive quality of the game. I wouldn't invest the $20+ in the game because you really only get a few hours of playtime to complete the whole story with all routes and achievements obtained. If this game ever goes on sale for around $5, then buy it then so you don't regret spending over $20 for it. It has it's fun points and it was kind of enjoyable, but it's not as good as other otomes on Steam, but it wouldn't be so terrible if more work was put into it. 5/10 at most."

I was lucky to buy it on discount, but I think it's orginal price is unfair considering the lack of art and social interaction between characters. I also found it to be boring and repetitve, at least give the guys more dialoge! There was litterally nothing to look forward to except one or two encounters from each guy, other than that, talking to them seems rather pointless because there IS no conversation."

It's very repetitive, but cute. Don't use it as your main time-waster, but as more of a cushion in between good games."

I never found myself caring for the character and the music was turned off instantly.In short I have no idea why I played this game.

Not much story unlike the other otome games i've played (mostly mobile) but still quite enjoyable and makes you really want to get that happy ending you wanted. Though first time i got the ""alone"" ending which made me depressed LOL"

So this one is no different you go for one of the three guys, go to work, write a book. Tadah. Not much to it, the difficult level is just as easy as the easy level (very easy)."
