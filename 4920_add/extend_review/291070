76561198027948551,Recommended,291070,9988008,"Posted: 1 May, 2014",all,Miszi20,"Slip is one tough run and jumpish platformer. It's somewhat like a mix between Super Meat Boy and BIT TRIP. Runner. What makes this game unique though is the use of the color switch gimmick. It starts of quite easy (even at ""sassy"" difficulty) but gets much harder pretty fast.You need to collect as much cubes as you can in each level and try not to lose too many lives in hopes of a score bonus, there is also a multiplier for going really fast and passing through a number of checkpoints without dying. Every level ends with a mini boss battle, which is usually even more tough than the level itself.On top of the 12 levels that are included in the main game (don't worry, the game isn't as short as you'd think, it takes some mastering before you can reach the final boss), there are also 20 challenge maps which focus on platforming skills (those resemble Super Meat Boy the most).  It would probably also be a good idea to mention the leaderboards (which work really nicely) and the handful of unlocks for different achievements like beating a level without dying.When it comes to the downsides - I didn't quite enjoy the music. The soundtrack consists of slow electronical tunes which I found to be quite unfitting with the fast pace of the game. I'm sure a lot of people think differently (maybe even rightfully so) but I think a drum'n'bass soundtrack would be much better if done well. I also believe that not everyone may like memorising the boss patterns for example, but I think it's great myself to be honest.All in all, I believe this is a great indie title and I'm hoping it gets the critical acclaim it deserves. I'd recommend it to all the tough as nails platformer lovers. I'd give it an 8/10."

I'm not sure if it's just that a lot of people dont play online, but at this current point, only two people have made it past 2-2 (one of them being me), and one person past 2-3, since I haven't gotten that far, and I'm on the easiest difficulty. But you will be spending a LOT of time trying to beat this. The color changing mechanic makes this tough as nails, and all of the bullet-hell elements in it makes it equally insanely difficult. Every end level boss will beat you to a pulp, and you'l enjoy every second.The game is definitely a fun one. Very lighthearted, and loves to have fun. Its meant to be fun, and doesn't beat you up for losing. It's got a lot of little fun bits and you can unlock fun little accessories, so you can have a good time, so long as you don't ragequit first."

Did i mention Steve invented the color Purple? Hint Hint?

76561198079602090,Recommended,291070,14631799,"Posted: 24 February, 2015",all,Chronic Crystal,"This game is fun and addicting but so frustrating. It hurts my brain. It takes fast reflexes and split second decisions and lots of dying and wanting to turn off the game but not being able to and celebrating when you get to the next flag and then losing all hope when making it to the end of the level and having to beat the ""boss"" until you finally train your brain and complete it just to have another level unlocked. Repeat. Sigh..."

So you've gotten to lvl. 12 in Race The Sun and didn't get your head smashed into a giant caterpillar or a wall that fell 2"" in front of you eh? Achieving those things makes you feel like you're the center of someone's homeparty and everybody's jealous of you. And then THIS guy comes around, like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ quarterback of your average highschool football team and smashes you in the stomach, takes a♥♥♥♥♥♥in your cheap beer and chains you to a lead pipe in the basement while throwing rotten eggs at you. That's what playing SLIP feels like.This game is frustrating and makes me feel dumb and slow. It's one of those games that gets hard REALLY fast and requires you to stay focused 110%. But that's what makes this game so interesting. Switching between blue and red while jumping, falling and dodging bullets is a hard thing to do, but when you're really into it (headphones on and soundtrack to the max), you want more. WAY more. That bloke that chained you to a lead pipe? You just chewed straight through the chain and your main goal in your life now is to make him eat liquids through a straw for the rest of his life. You want to wear his teeth as a necklace. You get the idea, once you start a level, you'll finish it no matter how frustrating that one part is or how unfair the boss seems.Get this game, it's a frustrating yet very addictive game with a high replay value. There's lots of stuff to find and to earn. +1 for adding checkpoints to the game. If the bit.trip games are too easy for you this is a nice step up the ladder of toughness.Also, ♥♥♥♥ you Steve. You know what's purple too? Your eye after I finally get to that ugly♥♥♥♥♥UFO you're hiding in."

It's worth the money trust me.The graphics look simple but stunning. They may be little cubes but they make the game so much better. They add depth and color to the world around you.The gameplay is what will pull you in to this game. To start it's not for the light-hearted. If you rage easily, this is NOT the game for you. It requires patience and startegy as well as fast reaction times. The begining starts of easy once you get the hang of the controls and the unique color switching mechanic. But what really will start the frustration is the end of the third level. I still can't beat that boss yet. But hey, I'm still trying!"
76561197992229015,Recommended,291070,12325419,"Posted: 2 October, 2014",all,Dire,"I can't really recommend this game as it is, but I may be biased, so it gets a ""yes"" anyway.It's quite ""simple"". You are a thing. You run. You jump. You dodge. The interesting bit is that you can change your color from blue to red and vice versa, which is really neat and has been done in the past and only recently with Outlander as well.This game is for hardcore players. Seriously. I consider myself an above average skilled gamer, esp. with platformers, but this game got me on the mini boss fight in level THREE on EASY (there are 2 more difficulties). It gets frantic pretty quick, the levels are really long and save points are more or less fairly placed on the maps. You are constantly being chased by a purple beam of death, which adds to the frantic nature of the game. Double jumping, wall jumping, switching colors multiple times within 2 seconds while jumping and dodging spikes...yea...nope. Just cannot cope with that.Usually I wouldn't blame a game on my deficiencies, BUT the game's controls are horribly floaty. There is no precision here, but it is absolutely required.Conclusion: If you want a really challenging game with an interesting mechanic, are not prone to suffering epileptical attacks and can cope with the dodgy controls, go for it when it's on sale. Otherwise: Good effort, but only a b product in my opinion."

,Recommended,291070,22038584,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,Fancy,"This game reminds me a lot of BIT.TRIP RUNNER, in more ways than one.The game has great music, is simple yet challenging and doesn't rely too heavily on any one gameplay aspect; much like BIT.TRIP.However, it also has the same problem with the difficulty curve; the levels are good, but the bosses are too over the top hard. That or I'm just awful at games. Probably a bit of both.TL;DR Rendered years of therapy useless by reminding me of the boss from BIT.TRIP RUNNER. 10/10 would waste thousands of dollars again."

First impression is that it is a lot of style with little substance. Basically you are paying for a glossy version of Simon Says. Obstacles come up to quickly and Bosses don't give you an idea of how they behave so you just expect to die over and over again making very small progress as you are forced to memorize the level and the boss patterns, that is it, no creative twists on platformers, nothing we havn't seen before.Lets Play can be watched here:http://youtu.be/yZ83TiD6ejI"

,Not Recommended,291070,30572986,Posted: 17 March,all,Runeyugi,I do not recommend this game to anyone. This is about equivalent to a flash game on some game website. It's far too difficult. It takes far too long to learn a level. ESPECIALLY Boss fights. I got to the fight with steve for the first time and I played for an hour expecting to learn something that would help me beat it. I did not and I can't subject myself to this pure tilt any longer. I like the graphics and music I think it fits together with the game well. I did not like the gameplay at all. There should have been more thought put into the design of this game.
