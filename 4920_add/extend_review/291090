If getting a refund for 2 bucks wasnt going to be a hassle, I wouldn't have even progressed into the actual game.2) To beat the game in less than 5 minutes, all you have to do is be the most beaurocratic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.   Just keep saying no. Bamm.  You win.    Cant be bothered to find out if theres another ending that doesnt result in being fired."

Voice acting was a bore, the graphic quality is slipshod at best and downright horrifying when a poorly animated face appears.  It has half the interactivity of Emily is Away with half the content and a less interesting story.  Not to mention the slant against gamergate at the start.Opinions are fine, but when you place them front and center with a banner that clearly has more effort and detail placed into it than any art in game, it gives off the impression you're either trying toA)Pander to othersorB) be edgy for buys"

Unfortunately, playing through to the end of the call was very tedious and there was only one scenario. The game was not funny and really has little replay value. I got fired twice, then I played through. Now I dont really have any reason to play again."

You only go through one call, and if you follow the script ""right"" you'll finish the game in under 10 minutes. It is slightly entertaining to also go back and try do it ""wrong"". Nothing earth-shattering, but it does what it says on the box and is a pleasant enough diversion."

It has enjoyable, humourous narative; Especially if you are willing to put the time in to find the real gems that make this game great.I do wish the credits were skippable, as they get annoying after sitting though them multiple times when you want to play the game multiple times and I wish the picture of Billy remained the static picture in the pre-steam release. The animated picture looks kind of weird.Apart from these things, this game it totally worth it for £1.59."

I can see how it's going to progress; each time I play I'm going to be more and more tempted to choose the snarky response, and probably get fired again.It definitely increased my sympathy for people working in call centers. It also made me feel better about my own behaviior when I'm forced to call one.Fairly priced at $2 for a few chuckles. The voice acting is good. The simple art style works well for the game concept. You'll probably get an hour's play at most from it, but it's worth having in your library."

,Not Recommended,291090,32688812,Posted: 23 June,all,ettglasjuice,"I feel the concept is slightly underutilized here in presenting a pretty linear path with only slight diversions. I don't mind there being only the one example but due to the inherit requirement to replay the same scenario several times to see all possible outcomes, it would help greatly if each playthrough wasn't almost entirely repetetive. Together with the very sparse and underdeveloped presentation I Get This Call Every Day is more of a nice concept that i lacking in most parts of it's execution and therefore ultimately failing to convey it's message in a meaningful way."

I think this was obviously highlighting a very specific issue and while it was an interesting purchase, I don't think I could recommend it. I bought it because I had heard the news surrounding the development. There isn't much gameplay and though I have spent around two hours playing through the same bloody call, there isn't enough variation, and therefore Billy, you will never  be able to change your address. You or the player will be stuck in an endless loop. The moral of the story? Learn to remember important stuff."

I remember there being a story on PC gamer about this game and that's how I found out about it. Anyway, the developer made it overly difficult to translate your original purchase into a Steam key, and so I feel like he's kind of shady for that, but in total I paid maybe 4 dollars for 2 keys for this game so whatever, What was I going to buy? One gallon of gas?IGTCED should strike home for anyone who's worked in any support position at all, whether it was a call center or where you are a top tier remote desktop support person, SCCM technician, or anything else where you have to talk to a person who is inevitably stupid. It's hard to explain if you've never been subjected to this, because even the most loquacious person is just going to tell you ""end-users/customers/lusers are ♥♥♥♥ing idiots."" This can at least illustrate some of the stupidity they put up with.I wouldn't really call it a game, but if visual novels are games, so is this."
,Recommended,291090,23479506,"Posted: 9 June, 2016",all,Otter Chaos,"I am a Technical Support Specialist.  I usually do my work onsite, but I still feel some kinship to the fellow in this game.  I come face to face with people every day who have insurmountable problems that have severely impacted their ability to run their business.  I can usually resolve these issues with a simple Google search.  Sure, sometimes I run into real problems where I have to call on some dedicated hardware support, or developers whose software has so many dependencies it could be considered a welfare state, but what I specialize in, and the calls I am given most often, are “user error” issues.To be honest, this is low level support.  I don't know the APIs, I haven't memorized the circuit diagrams.  I just fix stupid.  I'm ok with that.  Sure, I wish I made as much money as those other guys, but I don't know the things they do.  I do know stupid though.  I also know how to fix stupid.  Google.Heck, I have Google open right now as I write this.  Think I know how to spell dependencies?  Please.  This is 2016.  Intelligence is dead, and my customers are living proof.  Here's an example.  I had a customer call in and say that their email scanning stopped working for everyone.  Well, the first reason that would happen is a password change.  So, as always, I ask.  Did the password change?  She said no.  So I go onsite to see what may have happened, and when I get there the lady is standing in front of the copier CHANGING THE PASSWORD!Stupidity and lies.  That is what support deals with every single day.  That is what this game is about.  I approve of that."

And this game is about that. It's a twine game where you need to help a slacker kid change his address with his tax company. It doesn't take long to get through, maybe ten minutes tops, so even at 2 bucks I would say wait for a sale. But if you can get it on said sale, it's worth a little bit of money and time."
