,Not Recommended,291130,10001423,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,Osl112,"Please note: This is the second iteration of this review following an update and comment from the developer. However, it is not overly different to the first.----I purchased this game due to the premise - an anime style ninja platformer (if that makes sense). However, it was a little bit underwhelming and disappointing.Gameplay is pretty much how you would expect your normal platformer - it is nothing special. There are 3 levels in each stage, with the last being a boss battle. Each level gets more difficult as it goes along (as you'd expect). Whilst what you get here is nothing too bad, very few new gimmicks are introduced as you go along (certainly no new enemies (excluding bosses) in the second and third stages), making gameplay seem a little monotonous at times. The secret ninja technique mechanic is ok, but it is a shame that these cannot be used in the boss fights and that there aren't more to unlock or use (I seem to only ever use one).Controls are unfortunetly clunky and still feel a little slow despite the update. There is no tutorial - and as far as I am aware the keyboard controls are a little odd. Despite using an xbox controller, controls in some areas are a bit tempermental; this is especially the case with the wallhang aspect, whereby getting a bit close to a wall sticks you to it, leaving you to either slide or jump umpteen steps in the opposite direction. These controls ultimately (and unfortunetly) affect gameplay, making it difficult to dodge in some situations and leaving some areas a little bit tedious to navigate.In other areas, the game is adequate but not excellent. Graphics are standard, with some areas featuring tiling that is a touch too obvious. Sound works but is nothing special. Cutscenes are relatively uneventful and slow, and can be a little slow to skip.All in all, it is and little things that let this game down - it just needs a bit more usability and polish. Every time you die or which to retry, you have to do so from the level menu; I'd be more inclined to continue playing if there was a restart button on the menu or game over screen. Likewise, there could be more options changing sound volumes in game. Again, bosses could be better - the first two bosses were both disappointingly repetitive affairs, especially as one critic outlined them as ""impressive and fun"".Whilst nothing special was necessarily expected from this game, the controls and little usability things prevent it from being a decent game. That is not to say it is a bad game - some people will definitely find some charm within and with the game as cheap as chips it might be worth a look. However, I can't say I got a great deal of enjoyment from it - whilst the premise has potential, the overall controls and execution of the game could be a lot smoother."

It kinda looks like a mix out of an old retro game and ANIME. Anyways even it’s made so simple it’s still really cute designed (especially the „Maneki Neko“ the Chinese beckoning cat). There's not much enemy variety, but that's compensated with the awesome level design and funny Chinese details.Controls:The controls are a bit extraordinary and seem to be initially clunky, but are actually perfectly responsive once you get used to it.Ah by the way (if you buy the game) you also have to use WASD (up, left, down, right) and K for Enter (L = Back) in the main menu!Story / Gameplay:You play as the ninja girl Akane who seems to adore her master Goro a bit (looked for me like that from the intro lol). Suddenly Goro got kidnapped by the evil Hiromi.To rescue Goro you have to find a way through 15 stages. You have to fight against common enemies, to climp and jump and of course with the last part of a stage theres always a boss battle. If you want to make all the achievements you also have to collect all kimonos. You should use your 3 different ninja techniqes just when needed because you have a limited number of scrolls which you need for the special attack. So if it‘s just one enemy or two you can also throw one random „Uchi ne“ (it’s a bit like killing people with dart ^^).Conclusion:I recommend this game for everyone who likes platformer, anime, ninja or China/Japan because this game is really simple but has the named elements in it which makes it sympathetic. Besides it just costs2,99 €! That’s really cheap and a fair price for the game. PLUS you also getSteamtrading cardsin this game which you can sell or use for crafting a badge."

This game is a platformer, so that's basically a kiss of death.Some examples:Many of the games jump sequences, which can be over 25 inputs long, are set up so that if you miss any one of them, you have to restart the level.Fallaway platforms never reset, so if you spend 4 minutes on a level trying to get all the collectibles, then miss a jump / get touched, you have to restart.Wall jumping requires that you WAIT for the character to grab the ledge which she ONLY will do on her descent from her jump.  So even in a thin tunnel, ""chimney climb"" situation, you have awkward delays.Many floating platforms are solid when you stand on them, but you can jump up through them.  Then later the same sort of platofrm will be a fall away, or it won't allow you to jump up through it.  There's no rhyme or reason.There's like 4 enemies in the entire game, minus the bosses.The games timer doesn't stop during cutscenes, so if you kill a boss while time is running out, instead of winning, you lose.  It shows the victory animation... and then game over."
76561197997794254,Recommended,291130,10003637,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,Serenus Nihil,"Here are some extended thoughts now that I have played the game a bit more and read through others critiques.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a relatively straightforward action platforming game.  Through world 3 it seems to have a base set of enemies that are put in different patterns across the stages. Each world has 2 levels and then a boss stage, which may also include some platforming and regular enemies. Also stages all hold 3 specialty items that need to be collected for the best ending, I believe. Levels are timed, so collecting the items and completing the stage takes a little skill--although if you collect pieces and beat a stage, you keep them. You don't need to collect that particular piece again if you rebeat it for others. The pieces provide some incentive to explore around--as to hidden powerups.  Stage design is nothing revolutionary but enjoyable, mixing things up enough to keep you thinking.In terms of gameplay Akane does move slow compared to say Ryu or the unnamed protagonist of Mark of the Ninja. This doesn't fundamentally hamper the game in my opinion. Enemies generally move slower as well, so the pacing overall is slower. In terms of the wall-jump, there are times where you will stick to a wall you didn't want to stick to. However, its relatively easy to recover from as you can press down to slide off quickly or jump off. Wall-jumping, like regular movement is slower than other Ninja games I have played. But again it is a slower paced game. I will say I have only played with my 360 controller and I have not tried using the keyboard.Music is adequate and not repetitive or obnoxious and the story is minimal. Mostly I bought this for action-platforming and have been happy with that decision. It doesn't turn the formula on its head but delivers enjoyable level design and some clever bosses. Collecting the specialty items present another challenge as some require a bit of thought on how to get there and get back. The game itself is not very long, I am slow to progress through games and halfway through at 2 hours, which includes some backtracking. I recommend this game for those looking for a fun, straightforward action-platformer. Gameplay is simple kunai and jumping for the most part, but level design and different elements in the worlds keep it interesting.  If a slower paced game of this stripe is really not your thing, then you may want to pass.  For everyone else, given the price its a fun, short romp with some clever elements and small challenges to keep you engaged.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original CommentsSeems the first few reviews weren't that thrilled with this game. I just beat the first two worlds and had a lot of fun. I think the game-speed is a little slow, but this isn't Mark of the Ninja where you have to kill enemies in seconds or be exposed, its just a good old action platformer. The level design thus far is enjoyable and the bosses I fought were clever. There are collectables and power-ups that encourage you to explore around. For the price, if you like old action-platforming games its worth checking out from what I've seen."

The controls get a little taking use to, but then it became second nature for me. I used an xbox 360 controller. The game is very simple yet had some challenging moments. The artwork and style is what drew me in. A lot of games that come out get too complicated, as I grew up with old school games. This brings me back to my childhood. I usually struggle to complete games because they're too lengthy and have too many different abilities to remember. This game was just right and great for the price. I highly recommend it and I hope the devs make a sequel or dlc for it."
,Recommended,291130,10000869,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,Big J McNasty,"[FINAL VERDICT] So I finished the game, and overall, my reccomendation stands. I have a lot I could say about the game, but for those with little time or attention spans, I'll be breif. Its a good enough game for the price. It isn't amazing or even that great. But it isn't bad. It is just solid. The price is cheap enough for this to be ok, but I do wish it had more to it. The game is not shovel knight, or briad, or super meat boy, or any other big indie title like that. But its a good enough game for the price. The gameplay is solid and the controls work well. The Music sucks. Plain and simple it just is bad. Turn it off and turn something else on. The visuals are classic. The boss battles are the low point. The stages dont let you use your special moves and to actually fight the boss is tedious. It isn't about skill or finding the pattern. Its all about hitting it in just the right place at just the right time. All within a short time limit. Overall though, it is an ok game and worth picking up for the price.[UPDATED REVIEW] So the new update seems to have fixed all my issues. The slowdown was what was killing my game. Akane was unable to jump high enough due to the lag, but now that the game runs at the normal speed she is actually able to jump up and complete the level. Of course I still have a lot of game to play before I can make a final review, but so far the game is exactly what I wanted out of it. Its a fun retro style game with a ninja. For 2$ its not a bad deal.[ORIGINAL REVIEW] The game looks like a fun game designed like a classic SNES game, but for some reason it runs much slower than the trailer shows despite that I have more than the reccomended requirements. Also I can't seem to progress past level 1. There aprears to be an unreachable ledge that you have to jump to."

Playing as the clumsiest Ninja, you must defeat Hiromi for some reason.  It seems a man fell in love with this woman, now you must go kill her.  The story doesnt matter, did it ever in old games?  Get ready to slip and slide on ice skates as you trip over your own shoelaces to get to the final boss, murdering the woman that man fell in love with, HA, that will teach him a lesson!  Bosses are easy once you figure out their patterns, and you will die more from the controls than ever actually playing the game.  Ahhh, just like the old days, this is a great lazy evening game, since it can be beaten in one playthrough.  The game is real real short, I hope they make some DLC because its a fun game!!!Rating:  8/10  Value:  $4.99"

I feel like this was one of those games wherethey came up with the character first before writing the story. From my view the story is not all that well thought out and mind you, really cliché.A warrior, or samurai is admired (and or loved) by a lot of girls, the protagonist being one of them.Some evil guy pops up and steals said samurai. Hmm.. where have I heard that plotline before?Oh right, in every Super Mario game ever. They only reversed the genders. I don't know what it is with that ""female protagonist"" trend.. I like games with female protagonists in general, so I usually buy them and give them a shot. This time, however, I was disappointed.Also that's about all you get for a plot line. No additional thoughts, just genderswapped Mario.I have not researched the game's creators, but I reckon this is some kind of university project by one or two people. It's not a bad start, but there's a lot waiting to be fixed, for example the controls and general responsiveness of the game.All in all I'd say it's more or less well thought out, but kinda got cut short during production.There's definitely some potential there, however I don't see a reason to buy something that reminds me of Mario and Megaman, however is just inferior in quality.I'd have to say this game earns about a 6/10."

While the story is very simplistic, I couldn't help but enjoy the platforming game. I found it to be very relaxing, challenging, and frustrating at the same time. There are 15 levels total and the last 5 levels are exceptionally challenging. I consider myself an average skilled platformer, and I still had to play the last level roughly 50 times in order to beat it. Luckily, the levels in this game take less than 5 minutes a piece. I played this game with a controller as keyboard and mouse felt kind of weird for me. If you're interested in clearing this game as a 100% achievement, be sure to evaluate your own platformer skills as I said, the last few stages require timings and coordination--I spent about an hour just doing the very last level. I did enjoy this game, and if anybody needs some strategy tips on how to play this game, just send me a profile comment."
,Recommended,291130,30748421,Posted: 26 March,all,XenoZooValentine,"So, the revealing portrait of the protagonist you see in the store page only appears on the title screen and when you use your ninja magic. I think it's cute. I don't really care what other people think of it. Now, let's talk about the game.Our heroine is a plucky ninja with a secret crush on a samurai, who gets kidnapped Double Dragon style in the opening cutscene by a rival ninja. She sets out to rescue him, and to kick any butts standing between her and her true love.This is a pretty simple platformer, which seems to be aiming for the style of the old school platformers like Shinobi, or maybe the original Ninja Gaiden. The art is chibi style, the sound is basic but functional, and there's gamepad support.You explore several worlds of three levels, with a boss at the end of each. Various types of enemy ninja are out to stop you, but can be easily dispatched with a few throwing daggers, or you can use a ninja magic scroll to fling a shower of daggers in various patterns, which can hit enemies you would otherwise have trouble reaching wihout getting hit first.Spikes and other enviroment hazards abound, as you might expect, and some are a real challenge to avoid completely. Skillful use of jumping, crouching, and wall clinging is absolutely necessary to get through some areas successfully.There are three folded kimono in each level, which you need to collect 100% if you want to get the best ending, but this can be done over multiple runs. Since the levels are timed, you will not always want to go for all three at once, but re-run the level to get ones you missed the first time. Any kimono you're holding when you reach the exit don't need to be collected again, they'll be greyed out on later runs through the level, to let you know which kimono you can skip.I'm honestly a bit surprised I was able to finish this game 100% (with the keyboard!) as quickly as I did, since I'm not that good at platform games. (I have trouble finishing the original Super Mario Bros. for crying out loud.) A few of the later levels and boss battles were very tough for me, but for the most part it's just patience, practice, and persistence.I was using keyboard controls, so I can't speak to the problems some people are reporting with the gamepad controls. (I had no working gamepad to use at the time.) The control system felt tight enough to me that I never felt cheated by it.Overall, I feel like I got my money's worth out of this game. It didn't take that long to finish, but it was a cute diversion."

There's like 4 different enemies, one of which only walks back and forth, one has a broken hitbox, one behaves oddly on death, and one is a recolor of the first enemy because 4 different enemy designs would just take too long apparently. The boss patterns couldn't be more lazy as they replace actually making an interesting challege with just giving them a ton of hit points, guaranteeing that if you lose to them, it will be out of boredom. The traps on level 5 are a perfect example of fake difficulty, showcasing awful, uninspired level design.Is this supposed to be a soundtrack? Or did the programmer just download some random MIDI's from the 90's and stick them in? Or did the programmer also have access to a free music making program and just hit the keys randomly until some songs exported without errors? And it would be all that hard to pick a better ""breaking things"" sound effect that won't make me wish I was deaf so I wouldn't have to listen to this worthless game?I really wanted to like this game because I like kunoichi stuff, except I can't because it's so terrible."

I personally have yet to encounter a single problem, the game runs smoothly and (with an Xbox 360 controller) the control is great.Now for my little nitpicks: I felt like I was playing a slower Shinobi mixed in with some Black Tiger thrown in... That's why I was kind of expecting destructible walls (I stopped hitting the walls after a few minutes). Pace was a bit slow, but not up to the point where it breaks gameplay, it instead gave me the time to think and plot my way through the levels to find the charming Kimono's so this one is fifty/fifty.

It looks, at first glance, like it just may be simple, arcadey fun - like ninja jajamaru-kun or something. But this isn't that, it's just... too janky.Everything about this reeks of having not enough time/effort put into it. From the sprites, with their visible 1-pixel border around them, to the super basic presentation in the menus and title screen, to the (important part) character controls which are never as precise as they should be and far too floaty... it all just is unsatisfying to play. It feels like it was made after spending a few days screwing around with tutorials and saying, ""I know enough! Time to make a game and sell it!"". And while it's cheap and you may be thinking it's harmless to take a dive for 2 dollars or less, it's not worth it. It's just so tedious.Because while it may not offend with it's various pieces, it absolutely never approaches anything near rewarding or fun. It's just menial work. You set about to go through a course, and maybe you do. More likely though, you'll die due to cheap level design, enemies that spawn on top of you, or Akane having a slight collision issue. Either way, you learn very little from it, and try again, and maybe get it the next time. Maybe not, maybe try again. Do the next course. Repeat. ZZzzzzzzThis whole thing feels like a waste of time. There's the basic framework of a game here, and then someone built a game, resulting in it all feeling like it wore out it's welcome and has too much content, but without ever hitting it's stride or becoming worthwhile in the first place. There's no apex to this experience, it's all just a slight downhill slide. When it's not satisfying to play, and when there's nothing in the presentation that suggests a story or anything important or anything at all to care about, it's just... work. It's really, really laborious. This is what a waste of time feels like.If you want something that capably nails old school arcadey ninja fun, I suggest waiting for Ninja Senki DX to come out. As of this writing, it comes out later this month and is only $5. And trust me, it's 1000x better than this! Go look up Super Meatboy and check the recommendations for other challenge-level style platformers too. Just don't waste your money - however little - on this. It's not worth it, sad to say."

It is fun for a quick play but the brutally sluggish controls can make things extremely frustrating at times. Especially a few stages in. IMHO it takes too long to start walking & it takes too long to actually grab a wall before you can jump or attack again. I can't complain whole lot with this low of a price. But it really could use some fine tuning. At least for the controls.Also, it takes frickin forever to get back into gameplay after you die. I have a hard time believing it's because there is too much to load. The game is minimalistic. Regardless of how much time it actually takes between the point of death and next life...it feels like 30 seconds. Way too long. So please speed that up too.And lastly, I see the latest update toned down the sound she makes when she gets hurt. But...I she still yells pretty dang loud. If the game is at 100% volume, her yell is about 150%.Overall it's a pretty simple fun game that has potential to become better.

It is very hard and very very   Easy at times to die. Some bosses have techs that make them seem hard or near impossible to beat with the time limit. Then the item collecting is nice.Though I would reccomnd this for the price and for the content. For that alone for the price seems worth the content.It is well done and very amage to classic games in this genre. Though I do finshing it is near as hard as Ghouls and Ghost or the Super version of that game.Overall if you want something cheap and with cotent for the price can not go wrong with this game. Just be expecting Dragons Lair NES hard levels.I do say at least give it a shot.Cons: The bosses can not have powerups used on them that I have found. No other Life points to get other than 4. Platforming is ok.   You will need a contoller to get the most out of it. Hard to master. Very Quick level in difficulty spikes and curves.Pros: have not found any glitches in it or it seems run stable for me. Easy menus and easy to learn and play.But for the price it can not go wrong.Thank you for the game.

Granted, I have a few gripes about the gameplay, but I'll get into that in a bit.  The graphics are great, though animations are similar to a cross between 8 & 16-bit, with good pixel graphics, but characters seem to average about 4-6 frames each total.  Some less, some more.  The character design seems a bit generic at times, BUT they are whimsical and fun.The story is a silly 8-bit era ""Damsel in Distress"" where Akane's love interest is kidnapped by a rival Kunoichi and her shinobi comrades.  The story is told by a short animation without language, but icons and animation to convey the tale, similar to what one would find in the games of yore.Level design (from what I've encountered so far) is fairly simple, but flows well, and the levels are fairly short.  Each level is timed.In terms of gameplay, I have a few complaints.  It largely handles as how one might expect, but suffers from a few issues.  The Wall-Jump mechanic, while fun at times, is more of an annoyance than a benefit, seemingly working randomly (though I know it's not random) but often hooks me to a surface when I don't want to be, or causing poor Akane's death, or Fails to hook me to a surface when I wanted to be, again, causing poor Akane's death.  Or sometimes, I get caught underjump over and obstacle, and I end up getting hit by an enemy, maybe causing poor Akane's death.  Again.My largest gripe has to be what one might call ""ice slide"" (you know, those 2D platformers that the characters slide a little extra as the ramp into or ramp down from movement in ice levels?)  Yeah, movement handles a little bit like that.  The controls feel a little sticky and slightly unresponsive.  It is forgivable, but it takes a little getting used to.  All in all, I would recommend this game for a quick afternoon of battling boredom before work or during down time.  Don't expect anything too indepth, but it is worth the small price of admission (at sale price.)"

The game is definitely reminiscent of older SNES and Genesis titles. The music is definitely of Genesis quality. The controls are fairly tight although the wall grabbing ability takes soem getting used to. The game is fairly basic but it's an adequate platformer. The graphics are really good especially the backgrounds. The foregrounds don't always mesh with the backgrounds but this is likely intentional as that was the style used by many SNES/Genesis games. Overall the game is fun and worth he price of admition. This is a worthy platformer and a game that shouldn't be missed by fans of the genre.

,Not Recommended,291130,10184241,"Posted: 20 May, 2014",all,Demon_Dice,"I bought this game since it was low cost and was looking to zero out my Steam balance. You know the phrase “you get what you pay for”? WELL IT APPLIES HERE!Akane the Kunoichi looks like it would be a cute little game. The plot is simple. You are Akane, a Kunoichui. Your crush, Lord Goro was kidnapped by a woman in charge of a clan of Ninja. Her name is Hiromi. Save him from her evil forces. Simple enough. There are five levels each with three stages with the third stage always being a boss stage. Yes, the game only has 15 stages but it was nearly $3 so I thought “why the hell not”.The stages are relatively short. The longest being five minutes but BOY will those five minutes feel like an eternity with the gimped controls. Broken does not even begin to describe them. The jumping and movement is clunky as all get out. You can SLOWLY inch your way between rising and setting spikes with the most delicate of touches and still end up hitting the spikes when you mean to wedge yourself between them. On top of that, the Mountain stage has the gall to have slippery ice physics when it has a difficult time getting non-slippery physics right. Add all of this on a NARROW PLATFORM THAT RISES AND FALLS WITH ENEMIES THROWING THINGS AT YOU AND PREPARE TO SCREAM AND CURSE!Speaking of cursing the wall jumping/clinging is as intuitive as programming a Blu-Ray player with boxing gloves on. Whenever you even SLIGHTLY hug up against a wall when jumping you cling to it. With jumping at clutch moments almost always failing (running near the edge, pressing the jump button and TAKING A FALL INSTEAD!) the wall cling/jump only makes it worse. You have to hold in the direction you want to jump and THEN jump. And I mean ALL THE WAY. If you’re off by even a SLIGHT amount you’ll be stuck or worse. These kinds of issues are made even worse when its time to fight the bosses the dysfunction shines its brightest.You do get three Jutsu as screen nukes (all of them involve a stupidly high number of Kunai). This helps get SOME of the pressure off you, but beware, because before the knives fly the screen zooms in, THEN the Kunai appear and FINALLY they fire. This has foiled many an attempt using the downward Kunai rain to get enemies above me just because of that Goddamn zoom! Oh, and they had the bright idea not to have these available for use during Boss fights. Yeah...Level design is both uninspired (just platforms placed with a different tile set) and treacherous. Now, let me go on record by saying that I do not hate hard games. I however do hate hard games that are hard for the wrong reasons and this game is the latter. If you just want to blitz through the game I think you could do it in an hour or less. If you want to find all the Kimono’s (three per stage) this could extend the game time considerably. The levels just have the worst event triggers for suddenly appearing enemies possible. They seem to love popping up in droves in narrow places with high difficulty of dodging projectiles. I don’t mean in a “trick, but possible” kind of way I mean in the “there is no way you can avoid taking damage” kind of way. You have to pitter patter through suspect places or get wrecked and this is the most apparent in the last two levels. How long did it take me to beat the game? FIVE HOURS! FIVE. LONG. PAINFUL. HOURS because I wanted to teach myself a lesson for buying such an incompetently programmed game. So I told myself that I wasn’t allowed to stop playing the game until I acquired ALL OF THE KIMONO’S AND BEAT THE GAME. THAT WILL LEARN ME!Speaking of enemies outside of the bosses their are four minions you face (thank GOD they mercifully decided against flying enemies) They are (in order from what I found least to most annoying) Green Ninjas, Dogs, Hat Throwing Monks and Orange Ninja that throw Kunai at angles you cannot. The Orange Ninja and the Hat Tossing Monks are just the absolute worse with the control issues making them insufferable. One quirk about the Monks that killed me was this. Normaily they throw their hat at you and then it returns to them. Should you kill them when the hat is mid flight and not begun to turn around IT FLIES RIGHT AT YOU FAST! This has gotten me knocked off platforms and killed on its own too many times to count. The Dogs are also annoying because they run quickly and only their legs are vulnerable to Kunai’s. Aim at the top of their heads? THE HIT DOESN’T REGISTER!In later levels they tend to cluster up. The range makes the Orange Ninja and Monk the bane of your existence in these scenarios when they suddenly appear in groups in narrow passes making it nearly impossible not to get hit! What makes this worse is that ALL OF THE MINIONS REQUIRE THREE HITS TO KILL AND YOU CAN ONLY FIRE KUNAI BUT SO FAST! This is worse on the Boss stages when you attempt to get the Kimono’s because the Jutsu aren’t available here to screen nuke! And when they ARE available in stages the game is very stingy with them.But on top of all of that the final boss is a joke in concept (but high on the irritation meter). You do not fight Hiromi directly. She’s standing on a platform, walking back and forth with her jiggly♥♥♥♥♥♥(YES, I think they had her move just for that and Akane also jiggles when she walks/jumps) and summons minions. She starts with just the Green Ninja, but as she gets damaged she starts spawning Dogs, Orange Ninja and Hat Throwing Monks as she gets closer to death. You avoid and kill the minions and you cling to a wall and toss Kunai at her before you slide down too far to hit her. Repeat until she dies. That’s right... Hiromi does not fight you directly, she summons minions against you. For a leader of evil Ninja she sucks...the game cannot even give you a satisfying final fight. Yes I spoiled the final boss but trust me, no one has any business buying this game. And the ending is so lame its not worth talking about.Oh, one more thing...the timer still runs during cut scenes (boss intros, boss death scenes and even waiting for the stage title card to go away). I died because time was still going and ran out when I beat a boss.If this game gets a sequel then I hope the “team” that developed the first one isn’t allowed anywhere near this. In fact considering the games “state” they need to fire the play testers, the level designers and the people in charge of the controls of the first one.While my words are rather...hateful I didn’t want to hate this game. I wanted to enjoy a decent little platformer, nothing amazing for its price tag, just something to pass the time. I wanted to like Akane the Kunoichi. Their is nothing I like about this game other than Akane herself...and I think its rather unfortunate that the game she makes a grand appearance is so...flawed. The reviews listed in the store to sell us on the game are lies. These people either have not played a platformer before or were paid off to give glowing reviews.Do not buy this game. If you see it on sale, pass it up. If its a part of a bundle do not buy the bundle. This game does not deserve your time or energy. The company who released this do not deserve to make money off of this title. If and when the control issues at least are addressed I could probably recommend it for its price but until then I wouldn’t even send this game to an enemy. Counting the time I took to place my thoughts down and organize them into a coherent review I lost six hours and $2.99 to this subpar product. Please, do not buy it. Do not play it.

For startes you move so slow. when I hear ninja, I think fast pase action, now slow and slugish. While you are ""running, and realize you need to change direction, your character will slide a small distance before she turnes back around and goes the way you want. Jumping is such BS. some platforms feel like they wer eintentionally placed jsut hi enough so that you havt tot ake a longer way around, or only reaching at the peak of a movig jump, good luck with that.what hurts me the ost is that dissapointmen and wasted potential. I can not reccomend this game to anyone, please ignore."

One can tell this from some other subtle graphical aspect like hearing the damage sound effect play twice consecutively when dying, or being able to show a special attack animation even after being killed. Yes they aren't really important but they just show that the game is merely okay.Akane the Kunoichi does have some pretty solid enemy design and handles challenge properly. The boss battles are also fairly challenging in the way that boss battles in 2D side scrollers typically are. There is a bit of added content in the form of collecting optional garbs in each stage as they do add some extra challenge. However, you will likely get all on your first playthrough and you get no real reward for doing so.As stated earlier though, Akane the Kunoichi is only $3.00 at full price and there is definitely enough to get out of it with that price. It is even more of a deal when it is on sale for even less. As such, I can definitely recommend the game to fans of sidescrollers at its current price.Full Review Herehttp://www.gamefaqs.com/PC/710273-akane-the-kunoichi/reviews/160824"

If this was released in the earlier 90's, it would be the cheap chinese knock-off of Shinobi. Everything from the character abilities, enemies and level themes are stolen from Shinobi. But that's not really the problem here. The real threat here is just how terrible the game is. The controls are incredibly sluggish, you move slowly and the game responds slowly. Your only attack is a one directional shiruken throw. There are 3 ninjitsu clones but they aren't cool magical abilities like in Shinobi, instead you just throw shirukens in one of three fixed patterns across the screen. Don't even get me started on how unintuitive the wall jumping is.Overall the game screams of amateur design and incompetence in game development. There is nothing of value here whatsoever. Not even if it's $1 on sale. There is no fun or challenge to this game. Even the boss battles are incredibly dissapointingly shallow. The only positive thing I can say about this game is it looks okay. That's all. If you do dare to try this pitiful excuse for a game, make sure to mute it because the music is the worst part of the game. Clearly somebody using a musical keyboard for the first time in their life.Please avoid this game, we should not be supporting developers like this. If they cannot make a good game, or at least a creative one, than they shouldn't be in the games industry. We have too many terrible games selling on Steam as it is. If you want to play a good ninja platformer, you are better off getting Shinobi III on Steam for $3."

Wait for a sale and buy something better for the same price or less. The game is functional, but has a lot of mistakes that could be fixed with experience. I might be interested in another game by this developer in the future, but definitely pass on this one. Longer review below. Nitpicks below that.This game is basically a difficult NES-style platformer, but the controls just aren't good enough to make it work. There's a slight delay after attacking that feels very inconsistent, sometimes letting you mash the button and sometimes ignoring your input. Most ledges have decorative borders that you can't walk on but look perfectly solid, leading to a lot of deaths and mistimed jumps. It doesn't help that enemies appear to walk on these ledges constantly, even though they're only technically on the platform by a pixel or two. Wall jumping feels very slow and sticky, as you don't grab on until you start to descend rather than when you hit the wall. You also grab on every time you touch a wall while descending, and there's no way to drop off. You either have to jump halfway across the screen or ride the wall all the way down. Level design is about on par with any given flash game. It's generally not memorable, and later levels have stage hazards that don't really add anything to the game. They're just kinda there. A lot of levels are vertically designed or have vertical sections, where one bad jump or unlucky hit will set you back about 30 seconds of platforming, assuming you don't drop into a bottomless pit. Bosses are awful all around and are a definite low point of the game. It all adds up to a pretty poor experience.There's also a lot of small quality of life issues that shouldn't be there.-Bosses have about twice as much health as they need, so each battle feels very slow and tedious. The ones I've encountered also only have one attack, which adds to the problem. They're not even complex attacks that are challenging to avoid, so you're just repeating the same five-second loop for two to three minutes.-Bosses are also drawn art instead of pixel art, so they clash with the rest of the game. Some are poorly animated as well, making them stand out further.-Trying to skip a cutscene causes a slow fade out. Dying causes a slow fade out. Winning a level causes a slow text fade in. Bosses have a slow introduction and defeat 'cutscene'. None of those can be skipped. The first couple times you won't notice it, but if you replay any levels or have trouble beating one, it becomes irritating.-There's no restart option. You have to quit, die, or win if you make a mistake. Ties into the previous problem and makes it more noticeable.-The timer continues to count down after you die or win, and doesn't stop for boss cutscenes. Cut about ten seconds off the timer of all levels, plus another ten on boss levels.-Two of the three special powers aren't very useful. Most levels are enclosed, making the kunai rain power bounce off the roof in most situations where it could be useful. The forward attack special will kill anything in front of you, but there's not really any open stretches with a lot of enemies, and you're not allowed to have specials on boss levels. This leaves the omnidirectional special, which will generally kill everything on the screen. There's just no reason to use the other two."

In fact if you want the game to be as challenging as possible then do that because otherwise it may give you the impression that the game is much more shallow than it really is. Can't really complain about level design because it's good enough to allow you to finish every stage without getting hit once if your skills are good at this kind of games.There are still some annoying things that hurt the game. Enemy variety is quite low and the bosses are easy for the most part. There were several other annoying things when the game was released but the developer actually read the feedback posted at the forums and fixed most of them since then. Wall jumping is still a ♥♥♥♥♥ if you're not precise enough with your inputs.Music could be far better but it's not annoying and the last stages have much better tracks than the first ones. Sounds could use some variety too.Graphics are weird. The characters could look far better with a smoother animation. All the graphics seems to be hand drawn and then filtered with some weird effect that makes them look far worse than the backgrounds.Physics are kinda weird. Akane's friction is at times unbearable and can lead you to cheap deaths just because you wanted to move one pixel forward for a tricky jump and fell instead. Jumping is not that bad though.Positive review, even though it's not a super amazing game or anything like that. Be advised though that you can get all the achievements in 4 hours or even much less if you're better than me at the last stages but at least that means there's no bullcrap achievement like ""Kill 1.7 million enemies"" or anything like that so it's all good."

Now I looked at the version I downloaded from Steam and I can't see those icons. I know, I know it may not be a big deal but I just wanted to put that out there.Well congratz you indie developer because you got my moeny twice. I purchased this game back when I had the xbox360.

Now heres the deal; the game is quite okay for a 2d platformer, however my only complaints are:-The controls are stiff:I feel that a kunoichi should be able to move much quicker while having controls very responsive-Unable to skip the intro:Seriously do you guys need to remind me what game am I playing?? I already clicked on the icon, so yeah I already knew. Now what I mean is that can I just click start or any button just so I can go to the menu and then select my stage/level.

,Not Recommended,291130,10003665,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,WonderlandAlli,"I'll leave my original review below but I am changing from Yes Reccomend to No Reccomend. The first two levels aren't bad, but I have played level 3 over two dozen times and have reached the conclusion that the controls for repelling off walls are SO clunky its making it impossible to beat the boss (who requires repetitive use of the repel feature and is an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥.) In addition, you have 0 special attacks and no chance of finding one despite crashing through dozens of the item that usually drops them. So ALL you get is a basic attack. Each time I play, I can get the boss down to about (-----) health left, but still get killed off even when I clear the first half (the run part) without losing any hearts. I appreciate what challenge they were trying to present, but the controls do NOT live up to it and leave me♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and wanting my money back.Your options while clinging to a wall are to press the outward direction and jump or slide down the S key. Just hitting jump to repel, instead of holding the direction and jumping, is how you should have this set up instead. This would take a lot of the clunkiness out of the controls. (What is the point? So you can trigger the animation of her looking over her shoulder?) Same thing for the attack, remove the pressing the outward direction, just use the freakin attack key to throw out. We know she is not going to jump into or attack the wall.--------original below-------So I didn't really see much instruction in the game. Having played through level one here is what I figured out:1) A for left and D for right movement.2) K for ""ok"" and ""jump""3) L for attack4) Space for some super attack5) S for crouchingHow I -wish- it was set up would be WASD with K to confirm/attack, L for super attack, and spacebar for jump. This can be changed in options, and I'm working on it but somehow I keep closing the damn menu. I think its when I try to change what L does, it just goes back. T_TWhen jumping, you can move forward against a surface and cling to it. You'll move down slowly. You may press outward with your movement key and hit jump (K) to repel off and catch another wall.Kimonos are not lives, they are liking getting all the yoshi coins in super mario brothers, it shows how thoroughly you completed the level.Break the waving kitties for things like POW which ups your attack, hearts to heal, and some other things I didn't get a good look at as I grabbed it up.The game does not move slow like people had trouble with, not did it hang for me at loading, so I think their patch fixed it. I'm going to keep on playing, as I like the old school feel. I think its a game you'll get the hang of as you play. My only request is add some dialogue to make the story more engaging."

If you think you can play through these problems, then you got your self a nice and simple 2D platformer that'll give you couple of hours of play time, if you are veteran in the genre or few hours, if casual in the genre for completion. It took me about 2 hours or so to complete everything. My play hours are high, because I left the game on over night.Wall of text incoming.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First, the positive aspect of the game. The game holds the basic essentials of a platformer, which will allow the players of the genre to be familiar with the mechanics, so they can play without being lost.-Standard projectile attacks-3 types of special with skill icons that clearly shows the effect.-Wall grab and wall jump. You can hang on the wall and able to slide down by gravity or drop faster by pressing down. You can also fire projectiles to the opposite direction by facing the direction as coming down. Simple mechanics, but there is a flaw to this, which I will explain in the cons.-Touch sensitive jumps. Hold longer for higher jump. Tap for short.-Different types of platforms to give players challeges. If you played any of the side scroll Marios games, you'll recognize them immediately. Again, small flaw within the game's mechanic diminishes good of this a bit. Noted in the cons.-Extra objectives for challenge. Each stage has 3 Kimonos (Japanese traditional garment) that you can grab for achievement and special ending.-Low price----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now, for the cons of the game. This is where the potentially a solid platformer stumbles down. These issues really frustrated me during my play, which made me think, if the developer purposed created them to further challenge the players.-Controls are rather stiff at times yet slippery? To elaborate, the control itself is quite simple, but it's the way the character reacts that causes a misconception that the controls are clunky. When Akane begins to move, there is a very brief period of acceleration for attaining her normal movement speed. This can easily be mistaken for delay in controls, but it's not. Same issues happens when she stops from moving. She'll take extra couple of steps, which will likely cause a notion that you may be sliding. Normally platformer characters have a fluid and snappy movements, but that's not the case here. My assumption is that, the develooper tried to emulate an actual human movements for Akane. If true, such emulation is unnecessary for 2D platformers like this. If must be done with fluid and snappy motions.-Wall grab. Nice mechanic to have, but it falls short here. If you like to hold forward little extra long, perhaps influenced by other platformer, well you may become annoyed by wall grab, as the grab take action by pressing towards the direction of the wall and side surfaces in mid air, while right next to it. You'll often end up grabbing the walls and side surfaces even when you didn't mean or want to. This can be easily overlooked if you can let go of the wall instantly, but only way to let go of the wall is to wall jump or press down to come down slightly quicker.-Platform layouts really created frutrations for me the most. Usually there is an extra 5-10% room for you to make it up to the higher platform, but here the highest platform gives almost no extra room to make it up there. You'll have to perfectly time your jump from very edge of the bottom platform with maximum jumping height to barely make it up. You'll often fall down or grab the side of the platform if off by the slightest. Some may like this feature for purpose of challenge, but this is unnecessary if the stage layout is more complex.-Bug? In the water fall stages, if you end up getting pushed against a wall with water flowing in the same direction below, you'll be practically stuck there, as you'll barely move against the current. In that case, jump out is the only option. Sometimes enemy's attack will hit you when you are on a moving platform and hate throwers attack goes through the terrain in certain areas. Minor annoyance.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Though I made the problems sound quite bad, but they are something you can get used to without a huge effort. I did and still had fun, as well as some frutrating moments.Overall Score: 6/10 Average"
,Recommended,291130,12308830,"Posted: 30 September, 2014",all,The Watching Shadow,"EDIT:  After playing a bit of the other game they made I've been thinking back to this one as I have beaten this one (but didn't bother with all the achievements).  It can be very aggravating at times, but if you have the patience it can be rewarding to just get through it.  So..the above should be a word of warning about the impending trials of patience for those who want a challenging platformer.  I've revised the below accordingly from my initial not recommending.Review:I had picked this up in a bundle and decided to give it a shot.  At the time of this review, I've spent ~3.6 hours in it and I'm at the last level out of 5.  Each level has 3 stages to it, and in each stage has 3 collectibles to find and grab.  Probably most of my time spent has been trying to get those collectibles over...and over...and over again because of the level restarting from some stupid death or another.Btw...I was amused how Sonic the Hedgehog it felt with the splash screens introducing the stages.  Felt like the acts in Sonic. xDBeing a platformer there are a LOT of jump sequences to deal with.  It starts off pretty fun, but after awhile it's just gotten annoying to say the least.  I play using an Xbox controller and am pretty darn sure all the buttons working fine.  Even more sure after reading similar reviews of one big issue I've had - the jump timing being really clunky/delayed.  So many stages were restarted because of running off a cliff with no jump.  I've probably spent 2.5 hours just dealing with all the jump sequences over and over to get the collectibles instead of just beating the game outright.  I'd like to think I'm a decent platformer gamer but geez this one has been infuriating at times...which is not good.  And as other people have commented, many of these sequence are almost pixel perfect at times where you need precise timing or...game over and restart the level AGAIN.Btw, what's with the instant game over after one death?  Why not a few deaths so you can keep the collectibles you've gotten already in a stage and keep going?The combat is simple enough with a kunai shooter like megaman which kill pretty much everything in 3 hits.   Except bosses...which take SOOOO many more hits that it's just a matter of getting the pattern and slowly whittling them down.  I really haven't had much use for the 'secret arts' (yay special moves?).  Though I have a feeling I might in this last level for the little I've tried it.As I've said before, it started off fun and felt like I game I could easily recommend just to play around with a simple and short platformer.  However, the more I went into it and the more infuriating and unforgiving it felt...I really don't know anymore.  I'll probably spend more time on it just so I can finish it for all the time I have put into it already (and how close I am).Buyer beware I suppose?"

It shines with responsive controls, simple enemy placement that will make your eyes squint, and boss battles that will remind you that graphics isn't everything! This is a game that I would recommend to newbies and veterans of platforming alike!My only gripe was the unessesarry scantily clad heroine that you control.

Kind of frustrating at certain parts, but very easy to play; the controls are simple and the goal is clear. It doesn't have many achievments, but the ones it does have are pretty fair in terms of how challenging they are to get. Overall an okay game, but a bit lacking in terms of true entertainment value; it's one of those games you play to kill time or when you want to play a platformer but no other ones sound good."

,Not Recommended,291130,19527472,"Posted: 6 December, 2015",all,Razomir,"As someone who absolutely loves platformers (and the more difficult the better) I cannot in good faith recommend this. The graphics are decent, old-school pixelated (which I consider a good thing) but the good things end there. The controls feel incredibly unresponsive and slippery and the game has additional sliding mechanics on the higher levels. It's difficult to gauge where your character's clipping and hit box actually is and the game is relatively short (perhaps mercifully so). It also has some relatively cheap moments: while the levels are short, there are no checkpoints and falling to your death means restarting the level from scratch. The cheapness comes in the form of invisible ninjas who poof into being on small platforms as you jump towards them resulting in your character being ""elegantly"" bounced off the platform and towards restarting the level. I cannot say I enjoyed this game at all."

,Recommended,291130,21315614,"Posted: 19 February, 2016",all,Travino.EXE,"First things first, I wanted to say this game holds the neat personal honor of my first 100% completed game on Steam! And there will be a TL;DR at the end for you lazy folk.Anyways, this game isn't too shabby. It feels like it was made by inexperienced hands at best, but it has a solid action platforming concept, a sweet and simple story, and just enough difficulty to keep you trying to win, yet not forcing you to break your controller. I've played much, much worse.As far as the story goes, you play a role that, in gaming and societal standards, is reversed - you're a female protagonist saving a male love interest who becomes the 'damsel' in distress. You platform and kunai b-slap ninjas through fifteen levels. The ending is nice and simple as well - you get the guy and, if you collect all of the collectible kimonos, you get a slightly altered and better ending. It's a cliched story, but it's nice seeing a female protagonist rescuing a man.The platforming, which is the key element in this game, can often lead to unneccesary frustration. The momentum is awkward, as you slow to a stop when you stop running. You also have awkward momentum in the air, and quite a few jumps, especially at the end, are difficult to judge, as you barely touch the tops of the platforms with your feet and barely make it. There's also an obligatory ice-platforming level [sort of] that has you sliding rather quickly to, all too often, your death. It's shoddy at best, but you get used to it pretty quickly and work around it. Wall-jumping though, is better and a lot easier than most games make it out to be, but I do have one complaint - disengaging from the wall is a chore if you didn't intend on latching on. You're forced to either hold down and slide, which can lead to a lot of damage or deaths, or jump the opposite direction, which results in the same thing a lot more often. Executing the wall jump itself, however, is incredibly intuitive and feels good when you actually need to do it.The action is mediocre at best. You throw kunai at enemies. That's about it. You have three special ninjutsu skills, which also throw kunai - one rains a screen-wide line of them from the sky, one shoots a wave of them straight ahead in the direction you're facing, and the other sends them out in a star-shape around your body. The first is the one you'll use most, as it can kill the annoying kunai-throwing orange ninjas from higher up so they can't snipe you. The star one is the second-most useful, but I only needed it once or twice. The second, the kunai wave, is completely useless, as you'll rarely have a solid line of enemies directly in front of you. This one would probably be useful against bosses, but you get zero ninjutsu on boss stages.Speaking of bosses, enemy variety is nil. You'll run into the four main enemy types by the third level, and encounter nothing more throughout. A basic grey ninja that simply walks and injures you on contact. An orange ninja that does the same, but shoots kunai if you're in his line of sight. They're slow and usually easy to dodge, but can become quite tricky in large numbers. A dog that does the same as the grey ninja, but is faster and requires you to crouch to hit it. The last is a monk who performs the exact same as the orange ninja, but throws his hat that boomerangs back to him, and has limited range. Again, tricky in numbers, but not too tough. All enemies take three hits to kill. The bosses, frankly, are the worst part of the game. They're all incredibly easy (save the Dhalsim-like floating head until you find the sweet safe spot in the lower left corner) and have very simple attack patterns. If the boss beats you once, I guarantee you'll know enough to beat it the second try without getting touched.Powerups are incredibly rare. One gives you the ability to spread shot three kunai, and get a second one and you can shoot five, which is devastating. Get hit once, though, and they're gone. Then there's a timer that gives you an extra few seconds, and health and ninjutsu scrolls to give you more special attacks. Since there are no checkpoints and you're expected to beat each level on one try, there aren't any extra lives or continues. But since each level is fairly short, you'll never really miss them.The music's not too bad, but nothing I'd bump in my car or put on my phone. It fits the game but isn't really unique or interesting. The boss music is good, though! I dug that. THey're all really simple, couple-second loops but the music sin't so prominent that it becomes annoying.All in all, I recommend this game not because it's life-changing or particularly good, but it's an easy 100% [I did it in three hours altogether] and.. hey. The animation of Akane that pops up during specials is pretty nice ;) I'll admit, the boobies lured me in, and, while I don't regret buying it at all, I would probably have waited for a sale if I knew what I was in for.5/10TL;DRPROS:- Easy 100%- Female protag saving a male 'damsel in distress'- Easy bosses- Kunoichi boobiesCONS:- Shoddy [but manageable] platforming- Bland story, blander ending- No enemy variety"
