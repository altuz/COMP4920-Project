,Recommended,291170,12940386,"Posted: 14 November, 2014",all,MoralRequiem,"I'm going to recommend this game, allthough there are plenty of things I'd like to point out first. As in the description of the game,Follow the exciting story of the dwarven kingdom's eternal struggle against the troll hordes, who want only to crush the dwarves and claim their territory.^ After having played this game for seven hours, I have never been introduced to any shape or form of story.Unique units, a wide range of structures, spells, gold and various resources make this game that you will return to again and again.^ Nope, nothing unique. It's your typical TowerDefence game with the typical towers. Nothing new implemented.Tap anywhere you like for a handy pop-up menu listing all the units and structures you can build in that location. Tap existing structures to see how you can upgrade your forces with ever-more powerful improvements!^ This hints towards that the game description is the same as for the mobile version.Each level also brings new units and structures to help you fight the troll menace. You’ll never be lacking for new and exciting ways of decimating those nasty trolls!^ Sure, it does vary this, but not nearly every level as this description claims.- 60 different progressively challenging levels^ True- 3 unique game settings^ If they mean the difficulty settings? Then sure, but I'd hardly call having Easy - Medium and Hard options unique.EDIT: ^ There are three different biomes. Forrest, snow and desert.- 17 kinds of creatures^ As with every other game, lots of reskins.- 12 kinds of towers and structures^ True. Also very basic for most TowerDefence games.- Extensive magic system^ Can't think of a more basic system ever implemented. Nothing extensive about this.- Various upgrades^ Pretty fun to upgrade towers and such. Pretty typical to TowerDefence games.- Fascinating gameplay^ Facinating gameplay, what does that even mean?The game lacks keyboard support, which is a huge nuisance to me as a PC gamer. Obviously this is due to the game being ported over from the mobile version.Lacks a options menu. Two volume sliders isn't an options menu, however the ability to toggle between fullscreen and windowed is a good addition.The game only has three soundtracks that loops. Hope you have a playlist on Youtube or Spotify ready.So with all of this, why am I recommending this somewhat discount Kingdom Rush clone? Well, as far as a Tower Defence game goes, it handles more or less as you'd expect and it's not bad at what it does. It doesn't do anything unique or great, but it's still solid for killing a few hours of boredom."

For 6,49 CDN$ this game completely worth it. I played already 5 hours to complete the game on easy and i have only the act 1 and 2 completed. If u want a really good challenge you can play hard mode and heroic mode and your game will be longer than 10 hours i would say at least. Some fight are really hard and others are really easy. It will not be easy for most players to reach 100% of the achievements because u need to put some time into the game for it.I would give it a 3.5 out of 5Sorry if my english was bad and i hope you will enjoy this gameMelovia"

76561197983740996,Recommended,291170,35179690,Posted: 24 September,all,Chane,"Royal Defense is an enjoyable tower defence game that somewhat tries to be a Kingdom Rush clone. Although it's not as good as Kingdom Rush it's not a bad game.Pros:- nice graphics- decent music- DLC has as many levels as the main game- each tower can be upgraded three times- towers can be upgraded into special towers- base settings of towers can be permanently upgraded by collecting gems- higher difficulty makes the game more challenging- some locations offer a further view- some locations increase your attack power- some locations need to be purchased with gems, which makes the game harder- invisible enemies force you to build radar towers- magic attacks that reload in time or can be purchased for gems- option to pause- add or upgrade towers in pause mode- call magical attack in pause mode- two times speed- some enemies are immune to certain type of attacks, which enriches the strategy level- walking and flying enemies- enemy magicians can temporarily deactivate your towers- some enemies produce new enemies- option to manually direct fire on a specific enemyNeutral:- fixed tower locations- only four type of towers (arrow, cannon, mortar, money tower)Cons:- DLC is better than the main game- repetitive gameplay, most of the time you can stick with the same tactics- gems appear randomly- no option to reset tower abilities you already purchased- no in-game opponents wiki- no in-game tower wiki"

The only reason I can recommend it is because I got it on the holiday for less than $2....it's not worth any more than that.I'm an addict of tower defense games, here's the ones I recommend if you want a new game in this genre.1-OTTTD(the gore, the amazing art and creativity of enemies, and the hero system is just dynamite)2-Defense Grid 1.  (2 is ok, not in the top 5)3-Bloons TD5 (epic challenge, will stutter and delay if you have an old rig)4-Garden Rescue(original and christmas edition)5-Toy Defense 3-fantasy (dragons, wizards, fun)6-Fat Chicken (very cool and very different.

76561198044797961,Recommended,291170,23596168,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,Jan,"A little middling Tower Defense game. Graphics and effects are decent, but consume an excesive amount of hardware. There are only 4 kind of towers, each can be upgraded of two ways by a system of coins and gems. Foes are diverse. Brings 3 campaigns, other 3 must be purchased by downloable content, a dirty trick. Maps can be repeated 2 o 3 times en each campaing. It is too easy, perhaps is good to introduce children in the genre, but for an adult only serves to pass whiles and forget. Complete all game with 100% achievements takes about 36 hours. Its a mere explotation of the great Kingdom Rush. Only to buy with a high discount or in bundles."

Like the stages where it gives you no starting money and the enemies that sleep your towers (that have no clear counter other than hope you can select them / hit them in time)"
,Recommended,291170,30139119,Posted: 24 February,all,Helevorn,"Nice, classic tower defense game. Good graphics.It has some great downpoints though: even if you need only to complete one mode to get the achievements (easy, normal or hard), there are almost 30 levels for 6 different worlds (dlc included) and it tends to get very repetitive, the maps are quite all the same and you have only four types of towers.But it's still fun, for some hours!If you wanna complete it, be aware that it took me months to! :)"

It's fairly well done, the design is nice, the balance is good (not too easy not too hard) you can get various perks by playing and customize your play style a little bit. Not overly complicated, an easy play, worth a few bucks, I've certainly enjoyed it and at the time of this review I'm 2 hours in, already worth the money and I plan to put more hours in."

I understand some of the negative reviews but having nothing else to compare it to i have to say i really enjoyed it. It's simple pick up and play stay makes it great to hop in and out of and for less than a fiver it's pretty good value.
,Recommended,291170,13290990,"Posted: 8 December, 2014",all,Iggi,"This a mobile port, so keep that in mind.  The levels can be quite challenging, and you unlock more and more towers as well as the ability to upgrade them as you play.  You will also receive a separate shop, where you can purchase passive abilities that will help out the damage, range, etc. of your towers/spells (this shop requires a separate currency).  Typical kind of tower defense, quite fun.However my main gripe would be the upgrade system that involves a separate currency, which appears randomly in each level.  Sometimes you'll get 5 of the currency in a single level, other times 0 (zero).  The upgrades that require this currency also increase in cost every time you purchase them.  This will require you to replay previous levels constantly to grind out enough of the resource to pay for the upgrades.There are 3 difficulty settings though: Easy, Medium, and Hard.  The only problem is that defeating the level on ""Hard"" does not give you credit for the previous 2 difficulties.  I guess it gives more incentive to farm the currency required for the shop upgrades.Not bad for its price, but I also bought it on sale for even cheaper.  Was worth the 2 or 3 bucks I spent."
76561198053313753,Not Recommended,291170,16894806,"Posted: 5 July, 2015",all,Elmooo,"The creators of this game have managed to create a very boring game from all the right ingredients. The graphics are nice. All the standard towers are there, there are upgrades and it's not pushing the rock-papers-scissors mechnics too far.  Still, it's just not a lot of fun too play although I can't really put my finger on why this is the case. Maybe it's because many levels look very similar or are even re-used. Standard towers are there, but that's pretty much it. Some towers are badly executed like the sniper tower (lacks the huge range you'd expect) or tend to bug a bit like the incorrect range of the buff tower in some levels. There are only a few spots where you can place your towers and some of them you will have to buy with your crystals (which are also used for upgrades). The upgrades are also very basic and unimaginative (and quite expensive). The difficulty curve is very inconsistent (assuming a curve can be inconsistent). As a matter of principle I try not to use powers other than towers in TDs. Hence I did not upgrade them at all, making the levels where you start out with 0 gold quite difficult. You can reset upgrades but if that is actually necesary that would mean forcing a certain playstyle (which is a very bad thing imho).Maybe the most annoying thing about this game is that it is not necesarily a bad or broken game. It's just not very good. Still I would recommend replaying defense grid, kingdom rush or PvZ over buying this game even at a discount.Elmo, the grumpy lootmaster, signing out"

But for a $6 USD ""finished"" steam game, it's really terrible.Lets start with the basics.  It's a tower defense game.That's about where it ends, because this game is nothing BUT basics.  Fast starting arrow tower, slower AE ground tower, etc etc etc... it's just the same old thing you've seen a hundred times if you're a TD player.   But then you get to see the bad aspects of the game.  Spelling errors abound.  Graphic gliches where a 'bridge' intersects with the road.  Graphic bugs that cause the game to either crash, or constantly spam the screen with 'acheivments' (which block your spells).  Poor choice of starting cash leading you to be forced to grind early levels to upgrade towers.  Spells that just are very underwhelming.I'd say if this game drops below $1 USD AND you like very typical iOS / android app style tower defense games, go for it.  But otherwise skip this one.  It brings absolutely nothing to the table other than a vanilla TD with notable flaws."

I love tower defense games and I own few of them here on steam, but this one... it's just pointless. You actually can't build ""tower defense"", because you already have pre build spots on map on which you can build your towers, there is like 10 spots and that's all, so you can't build like maze etc. It's just boring and bad. Sound is distaster too (like you are listeting to PC speaker from '90s). Graphic is like on some older cellphone... not worth it. I played it for 10 minutes and deleted."

Except different skins, unpleasant balance and lower quality overall.- Tiny bugs, like ""sleeping"" guns are skipping the enemies, special power buttons are too close to enemy entrance, so you loose crystals by misclicking all the time, etc. Sometimes you can't say, where exactly the gun shot goes, because the perspective of shot line in mechanics and graphics are different.- Crystals are rare, so you will not be fully charged at the end of the game. Probably, a leftover from mobile monetisation scheme?Pros:- Plain and simple TD without weird ideas, field heroes, etc. Classic.
