As it stands this is as close as you are going to get right now to having Elite itself on steam, which is no bad thing ......Well worth the purchase price for that little convenience alone.So the 80s style (done perfectly) comes as no surprise, and the artwork (cockpits etc) are good quality.Music is top notch as well, hinting at radiophonic and kraftwerk, it goes to make a perfect background to this space sim.  Runs like a dream and you can max the graphics on a modest PC.It really does have the spirit and feel of Elite.So my recommendation is a thumbs up with crossed fingers, trusting that the development of Paragon will continue along its own lines and not fall down like so many other early access titles have been doing on steam over the last few months."

Issues ranging from consistent long load times (or the more likely failures requiring hard resets) at start up to freezes at the end of nearly every jump and worse. I gave it a shot because of the cheap price and concept, but as of 12/17/2014 it may as well be a pet rock. I wish the dev team good luck and hope one day to be given a reason to revise this review, but I cannot in good faith recommend this work in progress and suggest others avoid purchasing this alpha title until extensive work has been done to improve the overall game environment."

It also seems development has crashed into a wall at 100 MPH because there hans't been any updates for a decent amount of time without a word. At anytime before it stopped working I would've recommended this game, but unfortunately I can't.So the devs of Meteoric Games reached out to me on my poorly written review I typed on my phone when I was bored to give the game another go, so I did.My points still stand. The game looks A+ for an independently made space sim, and the soundtrack still gets me pumped, but the large problem is just that; it's independently made. I'm not saying indie space sims are bad, but it's still too early in development for this game to be playable.- It's highly unstable and crashes happen in ways that confuse me. The crashes are frequent but never happen doing the same thing i.e. fast traveling, jumping to another system, or simply requesting take-off.- The new autopilot fast travel is frightening. One second you're in space, the next you're colliding with the inner mesh of a planet (it teleports you inside the planet). It was fine when autopilot actually flew you to your destination, albiet it would occasionally smash you into a station or planet.- The camera controls are stiff, and the flight controls for the mouse are too touchcy.- Things I haven't tested are combat, missions, trading... but that's only because I can't get to that point.Kudos for the team reaching out to it's audience, but sadly this is a review for the game; not the team's performance."
,Recommended,291250,10105213,"Posted: 13 May, 2014",all,postmanmanman,"All I can give right now are very early impressions, but so far Paragon seems like a very competent Elite clone. The game has a great look, and even with some clearly WIP UI screens, it presents information neatly and accessibly. Plus, the music is really quite nice. (Though I've silenced it to play Nujaubes, which also happens to complement the game very well...)So far, most complaints are simply symptomatic of the game's alpha status. Early-game balance is very lacking, with early delivery missions (the only ones you'll be able to take) paying anywhere between $400-700, while ships bigger than the miniscule starting ship costing upwards of $50000. This will presumably be changed in future revisions, but in the mean time, all ship info is stored in convenient little .lua files within the game's folders, so manually changing ship prices is a good way to circumvent the early grind.Also, another minor complaint: currently there just aren't enough keyboard shortcuts. Clicking through the (again, very attractive and thoughtfully designed) menus would be a more painless process if there were shortcut keys to flip between your ship's views, comms, maps, etc. I assume this is on the to-do list somewhere, because it's such a simple thing.Oh, and the autopilot can be downright homicidal. This seems to be true of most space games, but the moral of the story is save frequently and try to keep an eye out for passing freighters when you're docking or taking off from a station.Bottom line, though, Paragon is a compelling and promising space sim. It definitely leans more towards approachability and simplicity than the impregnable X series, or the finnicky Evochron Mercenary (both of which are also good), though it seems that Paragon is aiming towards a fair amount of depth eventually. In the mean time, it's an attractive little Elite-clone and easily worth the $15."

Not much this observer thinks but then what if you add space stations and cities or spaceports into the mix? It's not illusion in paragon, it's all there and that concept alone is the basis of a game with plenty of depth. But of course i'm not just reviewing one side but all and so far the plot, as an avid sci-fi fan myself, is very interesting but still has much development. It is curently based in the not so distant future, around the 22nd century if i'm not mistaken, in a world where the Cold War doesnt end!So far however, this plot has yet to be implemented fully and more technical issues have to be solved around how such a massive procedurally generated galaxy can be kept stable and in working order. I take my hat off to the devs who are attempting this task because from what i've seen already if these technical issues, minor and major, can be handled I honestly believe this could be one hell of an adventure.With regards to the depth of the game, this is also something that is wanting but from the hammer and sickle on the space stations to maps of various aligned and non-aligned planets it seems the basis is there to create a universe of mixed politics and motives. Its one thing to play an rpg or free roaming games based in some distant land or with compulsory missions to weigh you down, but to have free reign to go about your business and make a name for yourself? That doesnt sound too bad and the potential is there.As it is you can fly around, see the sights, get a feel for how the game would work and with enough imagination have some idea of the end product but it is a long way off and despite my enthusiasm it has to be said that getting involved with an early access program with massive scope is not for the faint of heart and so only those of patience (and a definite love for sci-fi) should apply now, otherwise give it time!"

,Not Recommended,291250,29862597,Posted: 11 February,all,Mike,"Jumpdrive, previously Paragon, is what I would call a total conversion of an open source game called Pioneer.  Pioneer is essentially a remake of the classic open world space game Frontier.  There is a big difference in between Pioneer and Jumpdrive though:  Pioneer is still being developed.  The Jumpdrive devs have all but disappeared leaving a broken game behind.Let's start with the only Jumpdrive gets right:  atmosphere.  The synthwave soundtrack, the cockpits and ship models that look like they came out of a low budge sci-fi movie (in a good way), the colorful backgrounds all looks, sounds, and feels great.  Most importantly, all of these things work together.  None of the ship models look out of place.  Nothing sounds out of place.  Everything meshes perfectly with the exception of some of the artifacts left over from Pioneer, like the travel tunnel.  It all works so well that it pains me that the game doesn't really work.So what doesn't work?  The biggest thing is that Jumpdrive crashes when you try to dock and there's no way to avoid this.  You can take missions, buy cargo, or load up on passengers but whatever you do, the game will crash when you attempt to dock.  This bug ruins the game and it's been there since the last update almost a year ago.  Before this update, there were still numerous bugs.  The game would crash when hostile ships were supposed to be spawned.  In fact, there were no interactions with NPC ships.  Certian planets would not having clipping allowing you to fly through them but not land on them.  Certain space stations would have some kind of invisible force field around them cause both players and NPCs to bounce off them.The devs have disappeared.  The game doesn't work.  You shouldn't buy this."

It looks fantastic (for the most part), and the retro soundtrack is a very nice touch.  However, development is proceeding at a crawl, if even at all.  The game is a buggy mess.  The interface is confusing, and the tutorial leaves a lot to be desired.  You basically wander about aimlessly, eventually crashing into something or going in circles.  The quests are extremely boring and there's very little feedback in the game when doing them or completing them.  The COM LINK interface, though the metro look is pretty cool, is severely crippled by a confusing layout.  The space flying physics are flawed; there's no sense of floating in space - your ship just stops and goes like it's a car.  Fast travel autopilot is glitched and turned into a boring status screen.  The collision mechanics are glitchy, and you'll soon get used to that VERY annoying 'Game Over' screen which plays some cheesy CGI video reminiscent of something from the early 90s.If the developers get in gear and fix these issues, this may be worth buying.  It has such great potential.  I can only hope for this, but in the meantime, I've moved on to other games."

Virtually everything is identical to Pioneer expect for slightly higher quality graphics with a bit of post processing. Though I was keenly aware of the similarities before I bought this game the promotional videos and info I had read about the game on their site beforehand made it seem that  -even at this early alpha state- they had improved  on some of the base features of Pioneer. Sadly that is not the case at all (at least not as of now).In fact they managed to screw up some basic mundane things that were already working well in Pioneer. For instance, simple things like word wrapping in menus and UI. A large part of Pioneer's and subsequently Paragon's gameplay has you pouring through resource lists, menus and just general text. At HD resolution (1920x1080) the font is oversived, janky, somewhat fuzzy and in certain areas words or phases overlap making it a puzzle to decipher if you aren't already familar with what it is supposed to say. That's a big part of the game and if that's not formatted properly well that certainly degrades the experience.Another simple thing - In Pioneer when you visit various stations and or cities on planets throughout the universe the station personnel is represented by dynamically generated character pictures, made from snippets of male and female facial features of varying ethnicities and...silly mismatched sci-fi type gear. There are like 10 distinct facial features that are aslo mismatched to make somewhat unique (if not sometimes terrifying and creepy O.O) variations of characters to ""interact"" (they are just photos with text underneath them but use your imagination) with. Did Paragon improve upon this aspect at all? No, in fact they replaced that quirky dynamic character generating system with a very boring single, all encompassing male or female faceless avatar. I mean really? Maybe that's something that will be changed in the future but who knows.These may seem like little things but if they can't get these things right, well you get the picture.I personally regret the purchase and would rather just support Pioneer which is free and open-source. It's kind of shameful in my opinion that the Paragon devs are even making money off essentially a straight forward clone of a free game. Maybe in the future they will be able to develop enough unique content as to separate their game from Pioneer but as of now it is a mirror image of Pioneer with just an extra bit of visual polish.If I am somehow woefully misinformed and Paragon was intended to be a visual upgrade mod of Pioneer then my question is how did it get Greenlit on Steam?

I guess the developers left the game to die in the future mainly because they aren't even working on the game anymore. It's a pity to say that i wouldn't reccomend this game for purchase."

Twelve in a row has got to be some sort of record ;)It was nice to actually get some traction in game for grinding to better ships.Here is what I've now found that I can do 8 missions in a row...1)  Found a game-ender:  Farley Station.  For some reason, the ship will not ""geo-lock"" above the dock.  The autopilot stops about 1m from the surface.  I turn off autopilot and I'm zooming backwards.  When I try to manually pilot to the dock, when my speed is 0, the planet is moving beneath me.2)  Almost always now my starter ship will not dock.  I have to turn off autopilot and hit ""o"", then the dock's tractor beam complete's my ships lateral rotation so that I land.  This has worked every time until I attempted to land at the above (point 1) dock.3)  After docking and coming back from the dock info screen, the HUD mileage flickers.MUCH IMPROVED...  Enough so to recommend.===========================7 HF2===========================I have about 4 hours in this game.  I'm experiencing an ever escalating number of deal breakers:1)  Auto-pilot mostly works.  That, however, is not the problem.  When it DOESN'T work is the issue.  Expect to crash into docks and die.  One work-around would be too...2) Save often.  Except I'm experiencing a crash on save about 1 every 3 or 4 attempts.  So that leg of the journey (since the last successful save) needs to be repeated.  However upon landing (presumably due to the type of station) I again auto-pilot crash.3)  So instead of grinding these nickel-and-dime missions, why not play around a bit?  I modified a ship price so that I could at least make more than a couple grand.  So I fitted up the Starling transport, found some folks wanting to go three jumps for $5000 and we set off.  Landed in the system and auto-piloted to the dock.  Requested clearance and told this impressive space taxi to land.  No auto-pilot crash... time to cash in!  Wait, it didn't land... It's just floating above the pad.  I manually bring the ship back out of position and tell the autopilot to land again.  ...Still not on the pad.Alright.  4 hours in, and I'll be watching for the next patch notes to decide whether it's time to give it another shot.Update:  There was an announcement a week ago that the specific save crash I'm experiencing was fixed.  I'm running their current Hotfix (Alpha 7 HF2)...  Save issue still exists.So much for watching patch notes for fixes to these two (three, maybe more) issues..."

With TrackIR support, hotas support, etc and maybe some tweaks to how the craft is controlled, interfacing with on-board gauges and spotting ability, it could and probably will become a very enjoyable game.

It is impossible for me to load a save game 90% of the time and the same goes for hitting jump space without the game crashing. On top of that certian space stations will have me shoot past the docking process on auto pilot, bump into the back of the station taking hull damage, then reverse me to where it should have dock and then it finally works. Needless to say I can't get better equipment or ships because I'm constantly restarting. I really hope the devs can fix these problems. This is could be by far the best space sim I've played to date.

I would say so, yes, based on this update and the way the game seems to be heading now. This update isn't a revolution but it's a good step in the right direction for this game, the guys developing this have made quite a lot of progress in the space of a month. New ships, new cockpits, new space graphical effects with nebulas, a better autopilot, a better GUI for the autopilot, and just generally better polish and even slightly better frame rate.This game is making sure and steady progress but you have to remember that this game is ALPHA which means a lot of the features that you want to see here are not finished yet.What you have got is a Space simulation where you can pretty much go and do whatever you want, it is a sandbox, it is just that not all of the gameplay content and sandbox flavours are in their yet as the developers are adding to the games content as it develops.What you do get is a MASSIVELY improved and MASSIVELY polished up version of Pioneer with lots of things which Pioneer will never have. This game features a complete graphical overhaul, a complete audio overhaul and also a complete ship and assets overhaul. The game feels polished, it has a more simplistic but refined UI and it is making progress in the right ways which makes development for this game actually feel exciting now.Is the game worth £10? I would agree. Yes. If you liked Frontier you pretty much have the same game here as Frontier although the combat as of yet is not as developed as say other areas like trading and such. Though the devs have said they are going to be working on the combat area of the game.Jumpdrive is a work in progress but it is developing, and if the updates develop at the rate which this one has, and the way in which Adel and co are doing then basically this game is going to develop pretty quickly.Looking forward to Alpha 12."

With my previous review of this game, I had stated that I did not enjoy this game. Giving it another try, I still feel strongly on that as when I had attempted to launch this game I had multiple crashes which I had to manually fix by deleting saved files in my drive. Likely caused be owning paragon and the name change or something with the updates made it crash on launch. Anyways, after trying this game again with the supposed updates because I had thought it would be totally different, I saw little to no difference with how it started off, complicated and clueless on what to do in the game. I had this issue along with many other issues such as the game not supporting my 1920x1080 monitor. I had to run this game on 720p (terrible resolution to see after playing most games on 1080p) and also the game is quite laggy and seems unsupported even though I have an R9 390 and an I5 4690k which run most games on great settings but this game, even on lower settings, seems to drop quite a few frames. As I had said before, I see much potential in this concept which is why I purchased it, but I did not see that potential shine within this game. This is not a review attempting to destroy the game and idea but simply to try to help and see this game become something I would enjoy! So all in all I tried it again but I still did not feel as if I had enjoyed this game. And with No Man's Sky coming, I would love to see this game as it's strongest competitor but this game is not yet at that point. I mainly don't enjoy it because of it's starting complexity, I know I could learn it all and spend the time doing so but I don't play games to get frustrated with controls, I play games because I want to have fun!"

Can’t wait to see the way the game continues to develop and what new features are going to be added."
